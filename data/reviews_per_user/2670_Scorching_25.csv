Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Revenge is Sweet!
","Kill Bill: Volume 2 starts off where the first left off as the Bride continues to slowly eliminate all the persons who nearly killed her 5 years before. I thought the first film was pretty good especially with the many different storylines, cinematography and homages to Asian movies. I gotta admit though that this one is not as good as the first part even though this is still a good movie. It just didn't give the same satisfaction as the first movie.I thought the action scenes were not up to the standards of the first one. Some of the 'duels' i was expecting were not as flashy or as stunning as those in the first particularly the battle between the Bride and Elle. After all the hype in the first film as well as the first few parts of this one I found it rather disappointing and anticlimactic. I absolutely loved the story of the Bride and Pei-Mei. It made me remember some of the old Chinese kung-fu movies I used to watch in my younger years down to the classic 'You killed my master' plot line.I also thought the scoring was pretty good and some of the props and costumes were also good.It could have been better but nonetheless it was a good film.",7,0,1,20 July 2004
Dawn of the Dead," Nothing great
","Well I gotta admit I was rather excited to watch this movie a few days ago. The reviews on the film were good and some hype like those for The Ring were present. Viewers in the US seemed to love it. So much so that it actually beat out The Passion Of The Christ for top spot in the US box office when it opened. Well as I was watching the movie I was waiting for it to pick up and really scare me. I gotta admit I was not that impressed with the film. I thought story line was a little to ordinary and didn't seem too original. Some of the events just didn't feel right. Some of the other elements they tried to inject such as drama when they had to kill one of the bitten humans and the comedy just didn't feel right.I thought the effects were good enough. Most of the zombies looked realistic. Action sequences were also good enough but nothing amazing.
I guess I was just expecting too much from this film but when it failed I was throughly disappointed",7,0,0,18 June 2004
The Notebook," The best among the Sparks adapted movies
",If you have previously watched films that were based on a Nicholas Sparks' novel than you can pretty much get the tone of this movie. It really has the same framework on this one. People have been saying that thus novel by far was the best from Sparks and there was a good chance that it would translate in to a good film. Well among the three movies I got to say that this movie is indeed the best one as it had the best story. The characters too were far more complex and developed.I thought the acting of the veteran actors was stronger than their younger counterparts. Even if they only had a limited screen time and were doing very little they were very effective especially at the latter part of the film. The young ones did a good job especially from Gosling. Unfortunately for McAdams I had only seen Mean Girls a few short weeks ago and it was a little hard for me to see her doing two completely different roles.Definitely a good tearjerker of a film & I was expecting a lot considering the rave reviews of those who have seen it before me. It did just enough for my expectations to be met.,7,1,1,24 January 2005
Spider-Man 2," Spiderman returns!
","Finally the web slinging hero is back for new adventures. This new movie happens roughly two years after the events of the last movie. We can see Peter Parker in turmoil as he tries but fails to balance his life as Spiderman, his relationship with Mary Jane and his failing finances. This is not the only thing that is troubling our young hero as a new menace in the form of Otto Octavius who is instantly turned into Doctor Octopus because of a horrible accident the fuses four robotic arms to his body.If you were expecting more action on this film then the previous one then you will surely be disappointed. The action is restricted to probably a quarter of the film concentrated on the end. Well it sure does make up for the better screenplay compared to the next. More of the love story angle than the conflict between hero and villain. Yes this movie is more a love story than an action/adventure film.Most of the characters have indeed developed in between films and will continue to do so as you watch the film. The most drastic change happens to Peter as he continues to grasp his new life of normal guy/superhero. Here we see him develop as he faces more trials. The only thing that I found quite disappointing with the story of Doctor Octopus which was given less emphasis unlike the first movie. In that movie, we can see the development of Norman Osborne from peaceful father to the maniacal Green Goblin. In this movie we see less of this. Just a short encounter with Dr. Octavius before transforming into Doc Ock. Well in this day and age of high technology computers that produce effects that were once thought impossible I was not that impressed with the effects of this film. I guess it was really a case of 'oh I've seen this before'. Not taking anything away from the effects people the effects were good but nothing extraordinary. Well overall the movie did not disappoint me but it also wasn't that amazing either. With a sequel guaranteed, perhaps in the third film the director can do some adjustments so that the film can be better.",7,0,1,30 June 2004
Alexander," Alexander could have been great.
","I really did not really feel that strong an emotional link unlike other movies of this type like Gladiator. In movies like that you somehow sympathize with the main characters through their sufferings and victories. In terms of storytelling there were a lot of events that I wish the filmmakers could have done better. The battle scenes were too little considering the area the actual man had conquered. Also there were a lot of areas during the battles were I got confused. It was really hard to see what was being done and how it affected the battle. There were also some scenes which I though could have done in a grander scale considering how events in the history books described it. Events such as the crossing of the Hindu Â– Kush, as well as the battle with Darius.I thought the props and visual effects team did a good enough job in setting part of the tone of the film. The make-up team did a good job in transforming the soldiers as the effects of many battles were clearly shown.I thought this was one of Colin Farrell's better acting performances. He did a fine job in portraying the passionate general of old. I also thought that both Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer did a good enough job. I was just a little hard to imagine them being parents to Farrell.",6,0,0,24 November 2004
Constantine," Just like a diesel it only heats up in the end
","I'm not that familiar with the Hellblazer comic series, which this film is based on. I think this helped me keep an open mind free of any unrealistic expectations especially about the characters. One thing though that was surprised was the lack of many elaborate, gut-wrenching fight scenes.Also given that most movies adapted from comic books are fast paced this started at a snail's pace. A lot of talking and introduction of characters. However as the minutes came and went the pace picked up and the elements, which seemed insignificant at the start came into place to provide a good climax.Also given that this was adapted from a comic book I really was not expecting that a very deep storyline but surprisingly it was certainly above average and was quite intelligent for it's class.My major gripe about this film was the acting performance of the actors particularly of Keanu Reeves. I never really rated him as an actor and found him one-dimensional. This movie further reinforced that belief. Most of the lines he delivered were rather flat with little emotion shown. The others did well enough but I felt Reeves overshadowed all of them given his significant screen time.The effects I thought were fine. Nothing as extravagant perhaps as LOTR but nonetheless effective given the purpose. Cinematography I thought was ordinary.",7,2,20,17 February 2005
Troy," Pretty nice film
","Looking at the numbers associated with this film in a magazine, made me ponder a lot about this film as I entered the cinema today to watch the film. That's TWO HUNDRED MILLION in dollars the production budget for this film depicting the epic as written by the Greek writer Homer. A huge amount of which or $17.5 million went to Brad Pitt's pockets. That's 200 million reasons to love it or just as many reasons to hate it. That's still a lot of money to produce one film even in this day and age of films costing millions of dollars. That makes this film either an expensive instant classic in the mold of Lord of the Rings trilogy or Waterworld.Another figure to look at is 162 that's how long this film is in minutes. Again to me this seemed a little too long at first, which depending on the, merits of the film can either seem like a breeze or be just be pure torture.Coming into the film I knew very little of the plot line of the film as I have not had the privilege of reading Homer's work, just the basic elements as seen in a few reviews and summaries of the film. I got to say I'm quite glad that this was the case as this meant that I had a virtual 'clean slate' regarding the details of the story and this lead to me having a feeling of heightened sense of anticipation as the scenes slowly unfolded. My only gripe from this is I wish they had explored more on the development of the relationship of Helen and Paris before the war as well as more time during the Trojan horse scene. It would also be rather hard for me to comment on whether the filmmakers did a good job in converting the book into a film as I have yet to read Homer's work.I actually found the casting quite refreshing as I was able to see some of the legends of the screen like Peter O'Toole interact with the stars of today like Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and as well as the emerging stars of tomorrow like Orlando Bloom and Diane Kruger. I think the acting was good enough for most characters nothing great. I sort of found the acting of Kruger a little too raw for the role. Perhaps it's because she was nervous or she was just too inexperienced at this level. Perhaps we can see a better display from her in the future as I have heard she has a few more movies in the future. I thought director Wolfgang Petersen did a good job in setting the mood of the film with the breathtaking cinematography. I especially loved the exterior shots of both the Greek and Trojan armies marching against each other into battle. The costumes and props were also looked quite good. I thought the film score though was a little average at this point nothing very much to talk about. Overall it was a pretty solid film with a lot of good points and was well worth both my money as well as the production companies.",8,1,2,15 May 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Mother Nature gone awry!
","The Day After Tomorrow explores the possibility of the world's weather going absolutely mad due to global warming. Cataclysmic events from tornadoes in Los Angeles to New York City freezing over. All of these events and a lot more in the hands of Independence Day and The Patriot director Roland Emmerich. Dennis Quaid is Jack Hall, a climatologist who predicts dire consequences as a result of global warming leads the cast. At first only a few people believe him but as events he predicted slowly become reality many rue that they ignored his calls for action. Also starring Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko, Moonlight Mile) as Hall's son Sam who is trapped in New York after an academic competition, Sela Ward (Once and Again) as Hall's wife Lucy and Ian Holm (Lord of the Rings) as fellow climatologist Terry Rapson. Well there has been a lot of news about this movie in the last few weeks leading up to it's opening. You know all this talk of politics, the Third World, the Kyoto Protocol, and other related issues. The whole Left Wing movie issue. Well I'm going to make it clear right here, that I would try my best to limit commenting on such issues, especially on whether or not any of this can actually happen.The primary thing that really attracted me to this film was the special effects as shown in the trailers. That great shot of a frozen New York was absolutely breathtaking. I got to say the effects were really great! What can you really expect they did spent millions of dollars just to make events as realistic as possible? Most of the effects in the scenes were well done and the level of detail in them was great.I however found the plot line rather lacking in substance. It was quite shallow to be honest. Placed in there so that they can put in a human element in all this destruction. In movies such as this, the director would try to let you feel pity for the characters in the story. In this aspect I felt the movie failed and that perhaps it could have been done better. There were the occasional humorous moments but it felt a little out of place. The ending also was quite a letdown rather anticlimactic in fact. It just felt lacking and that things happened way too fast. Perhaps another 20-25 minutes should have been added.In terms of the performances by the actors, I felt that they never really had the opportunity to show the level of their acting. In a way the effects eclipsed all of the characters. No doubt the effects of this film were really great and perhaps is the main strength of the film. I just had hoped that the storyline would have been better crafted so that instead of the effects taking center stage than it would be mankind's bravery, determination generosity and that would.",7,0,0,26 May 2004
Ocean's Twelve," Twelve is less than eleven
","Well the whole cast is back for another caper this time in the shores of Europe as they are all banned from the casinos of the US. THis time however there is an added twist as Terry Benedict wants his money back and a cop is hot on their trail.One thing I liked about the first film was the way Soderburg was able to mesh together all eleven characters to form a cohesive and fun story. Sadly however he was unable to duplicate it here. It seemed like that only a few characters that were getting substantial screen time. Yes, they were all back but it seemed like it wasn't necessary. All that top billing for guys like Garcia and Mac for bit parts.I also found the story not as enthralling as the first. Whereas the story of the first felt original and exciting this was more bland. It just didn't have the same punch as the first. The first was a really fun I also found it a little confusing at times and only really fully understood the movie after much discussion with those who have seen the movie.Well compared to the first movie there were a lot of really funny moments. Whereas the first was more serious this was a little more light.Well i'm really hoping they put this franchise to bed. I think by doing a sequel like Twelve it has really damaged the reputation it had produced after the first movie.",7,0,1,13 February 2005
The Village," Not the best but it's up there
","Just like any film from director M. Night Shayamaylan you can expect that there would be a twist neat the end of the film which pretty much defines how good or bad that movie is. I got to say that despite what a lot of people said I actually liked the twist of the movie. I definitely think that this was better than the one they had in Unbreakable and perhaps Signs. I was pretty shocked when they revealed the true nature pf the Village.Another great aspect I felt was the performance of Bryce Howard, daughter of acclaimed director Ron. She seemed to be very comfortable with her role and seemed to fly through her role as a blind woman. I especially liked her performance towards the end of the film. I guess the fact that she was trained on a stage acting where there are no take twos unlike the world of cinema.I guess one of my main disappointments with the film because I though the movie would take a more supernatural approach as seen in the trailer. Yes there were few parts that had thus but generally it was more of a drama. Plus they had a love story placed in as a major theme which made it even bizarre.",7,0,0,20 January 2005
"I, Robot"," I was expected more from the film
",I-Robot is set in a futuristic society were robots are part of everyday life. On the eve of a massive deployment of the newest robot model a suicide rocks the community which seems more sinister than it seems. Del Spooner is a detective who pursues the case and with the help of a beautiful robot psychologist they soon discover that there is more to the death than what was first thought.I thought the movie was okay nothing special. There was nothing really very outstanding about the story. Also the effects especially the robots were well made. As the characters digged deeper into the death it seemed that the tension and anticipation didn't build enough to a sufficient level as I expected it to be. Also I thought that they should have given a bigger role to the female lead perhaps as close as possible to the robot. I thought the robot really was a poor substitute and didn't really fit the bill as one of the major characters in the film.I didn't really like the ending of the film. Despite the mediocre events leading up to the end of the movie I was still expecting the climax to be better but I was to be disappointed. Not really your typical ending and I heard that it was rather similar to another scifi animated movie.,7,0,0,26 December 2004
Van Helsing," Poor Effort
","When I first heard of this movie via a trailer I was quite intrigued by what it would offer. Hugh Jackman looked good in this role and Kate Beckinsale also looked good especially after the whole Underworld experience. But as I was looking at the credits I felt disappointed that this movie was actually written and directed by Stephen Sommers of `The Mummy' fame. Which goes without saying that I did not enjoy the last Mummy film.As expected the film was filled with action and CGI characters. The meshing of the characters was uncoordinated. The little comic relief from David Wenham was drab and unoriginal. The acting, dialogue and plot were absolutely substandard. The only thing I enjoyed in this film was probably Art Direction, and Costumes.If you are in for a mindless thrill ride then perhaps you might enjoy this movie. You might be able to enjoy the action and monster action, but nothing really in terms of substance.",6,0,0,7 May 2004
Collateral," Strong performces in a good thriller
","Maybe some spoilers!Collateral is the latest film from Michael Mann and is the story of a LA cab driver Max who dreams of owning his own limo service. It starts like any other night moving people around in his cab. Things however take a drastic change when he is offered by Vincent to ferry him around for his 'business' and to visit his 'friends'. What happens next is a roller coaster ride as Max tries to get away.Well this is probably one of the summer movies that I wanted see once I found out of the summer movie line-up. Plus the fact that it was to be released in the latter part of the summer really helped build up the anticipation for this film.When I found out that Tom Cruise was to play the 'bad guy', I was excited to see Cruise play the bad guy since I loved his performance in Interview With the Vampire. Hey you don't see him play a bad guy that often so I was interested how he was going to do here. He did a pretty convincing job as a bad guy. Very menacing especially with his great dialog and movements. I would hate to run into this guy in if he were a real person.As for the casting of Jaime Foxx as the 'good guy', I wasn't that pleased at first. Hey it's not like he did a good job with Bait. Plus I have a hard time digesting the fact that this guy who is known more for his comedy can do an action film. Pretty much like Owen Wilson in Behind Enemy Lines. Well Foxx did a good job considering that I wasn't really expecting a lot from him. At times he even outshone Cruise, who like I said did a great job.Michael Mann did a great job with directing. I found the close shots, which really dominated the film rather refreshing. To the point that sometimes you feel you are standing next to the characters in the film. I wasn't too convinced with the screenplay though and I feel some of the characters were placed in to the movie so as to fill the star power of the film. To the point that the movie can go on even without these characters.Well what looks like the last major summer movie of the year turned into a fulfilling experience accented by great performances by the two lead actors.",7,0,0,5 August 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," New Director, Same Old Fun
","The third Harry Potter film has finally arrived in cinemas after a rather long two-year wait. Alfonso Cuaron takes over at the director's chair while erstwhile director Chris Columbus becomes a producer.  It is Harry's third year at Hogwarts and this time he must face a new foe in the person of Sirius Black an escaped murderer from Azkaban prison who is out to get Harry.There is always a risk for a successful movie franchise to take on a new director especially if the previous one did a good job. Well I got to say that Cuaron has justified his hiring as he has done a great job in crafting this film. He was really able to capture the dark moments of the film and I as a viewer was able to feel feelings of fear and uneasiness. I also felt that some of his rather unique camera angles were really good. Really breathtaking stuff that added to the overall feel of the movie.  
I thought that the effects were great. The dementors looked really menacing and scary. The Hippogriffs also looked good. Even if the effects were not in a grand scale like ROTK, they still did great job in crafting these creatures and make him look real.In terms of its story I felt that it was much richer and deeper than the previous films. Definitely a much darker and deeper story, which really helped the film in the long run. I wasn't so convinced with the performance of Michael Gambon as Dumbeldore. I guess it may be because Richard Harris did such a great job in previous films that anyone who takes over pales in comparison. Harris' had a unique atmosphere which Gambon didn't have. Even though the story places the characters a year after the previous film some of the looks much older than that especially Daniel Radcliffe. I guess you really can't blame the cast, as they cannot film every year just to make the grade. I would be really interested to see how the cast look for the fourth film.    Overall Cuaron did a great job in creating a great film. I must say that this is the best Harry Potter movie so far. It is really a shame that this will be the only HP film he will be able to direct. Based on what I have heard of the fourth book I must say that the next film promises to be even better than this film.",7,0,1,2 June 2004
The Incredibles," What a pleasant surprise!
","Pixar has quite a good record when it comes to producing quality animated features. From it's pioneering 'Toy Story' to the fabulous 'Monsters Inc.' and the very funny 'Finding Nemo'. Now comes The Incredibles. This film explores the life of superheroes that all of a sudden are forced into a premature retirement, much to their dismay. However soon they are forced back into an action to counter an unlikely enemy. Well because Pixar's last two efforts were comedies and based on the trailer of this one I was expecting this to also be a comedy. To my surprise their were only a few funny moments in the film. So guys don't expect to be laughing all through the movie. It was a little annoying at first but eventually I got used to it and was able to appreciate the movie more.As expected the production team did a great job in creating beautiful characters and a realistic world around them. Even up to now I still can't help but admire computer made animation. I guess it has something to do with growing up and getting used to seeing animation done by hand and this one seems so different and unique to what I am used to.My impression on the cast initially was not that positive. Seeing how past films would pack their rosters with A List actors to do the voicing, this one really didn't live up to that 'standard'. Plus the fact that I felt that Craig T. Nelson didn't really fit the role (as I had expected this to be a pure comedy). After the film I'm still not that convinced with Nelson but I thought Holly Hunter did a great job. You go just feel that Elasti-Girl's character fits Hunter's personality to a T.I really cannot comment much on the plot line. Normally I wouldn't like this type of story which seemed a little predictable but this is after all a movie intended for the younger set and perhaps this can be excused.In the final reckoning, it may not be as good as perhaps Monsters Inc. or Finding Nemo but it was still a credible effort. Overall quite a solid movie which many will enjoy.",7,1,2,5 November 2004
Shrek 2," Good film but not as great as the first!
","The cast of Shrek returns for another adventure. Shrek (Mike Myers), Fiona (Cameron Diaz), Donkey (Eddie Murphy) reprise their roles and are joined by Antonio Banderas, John Cleese and Julie Andrews. Shrek and Fiona are invited by her parents to a ball to celebrate their marriage. But to her parent's surprise their daughter is a still an Ogre and has even married one!It is always a challenge for filmmakers to come up with a sequel that at the very least comes close to it's predecessor. So many great films have come up with substandard follow-ups which in a way has tainted it's great reputation. Well it looks like you need not add the name of Shrek to that rather dubious list.I thought the animators of Dreamworks did a great job once again in terms of coming up with a quality animation picture. The visuals were so good that sometimes you actually forget that you are watching an animated film. The very colourful visuals and stunning detail makes you appreciate the painstaking work of the animators over the many months.I thought the story was much better and deeper than the first movie. The story more complex than the first. You are able to see more of the personality of the main character his strengths, and his insecurities.I think because of the relatively intricate story line that it contributed to the movies being less funny. The few funny scenes were mostly made by Donkey and Prince Charming. Shrek I felt was a lot more serious in this film and his occasional wisecracks didn't do it for me. Also some greats cameos by Larry King as the Ugly Stepsister and Joan Rivers. Don't get me wrong this is still a funny movie but it pales to the original.
Great film not as good at first but a good film nonetheless. Well I heard that they are already working on Shrek 3 and I'm looking forward to it already.",7,0,0,22 May 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A breath of fresh air!
","They released this movie in this country a few months after its US release which meant that I had more than enough time to hear all the rave reviews and praises for this film by both film critics and ordinary moviegoers. So when the film finally made its debut locally I made it a point to see it right away.First and foremost let's get to the screenplay of the film. The whole narrative of the movie was unique and refreshing. Even though initially the idea didn't really click with me, however over the course of the movie I began to love the unique nature of the story. I thought the basic flow of the movie can sometimes get confusing as you try to figure out which part comes first and what follows ala 21 Grams or Memento. Nonetheless it was effective in getting the story across to us the viewers.Even though I was not that impressed with Jim Carrey's previous 'dramatic' roles in the Truman Show and The Majestic, I thought this effort was good enough. Maybe even the best performance among the three. I thought he really did a good job in juggling emotions of love with bitterness and sorrow. Not really a performance that will net Carrey a small gold statue come March but nonetheless still a good job. If Carrey's performance was good, I thought Kate Winslett's performance was also. She was very effective as Clementine so much that you can really feel some of the emotions that Joel Barrish might have felt. This was supported by great performances by the supporting cast most notably by Tom Wilkinson who was more than what meets the eye.I feel this film could get a lot of accolades when the awards season starts up next year. How many awards it will take home will be determined once the other contenders come out. This will definitely compete strongly in screenplay and some acting honors.",8,0,1,24 December 2004
National Treasure," Not much of a treasure of a film
","There have been many movies about treasure hunters and there is not much that you can work on in terms of the story. This movie certainly fits this description. Even though they added some elements to enhance it, I found the story mediocre. Once the premise was set at the start it's pretty much downhill from there. The ending also was too cheesy and was rather disappointing. What I found quite laughable were the names of the leading characters. Names like Benjamin Franklin Gates and the supposedly German name Abigail Chase. Surely they could have thought of better and more original names than these.In terms of the acting I think most of the cast did a good enough job. There were times that Kruger's acting was poor. Perhaps her relative inexperience is to blame. Also her accent was evident on some of the scenes which I thought didn't fit her character even thought the filmmakers tried to mask that with a thin excuse.Didn't really think too much of them adding some humor in the form of Riley. There were times that his one liners were very amusing and at times a little annoying.Not one of the best movies by a long shot but a good enough film if you want something light and perhaps something to relax you after a long week.",7,0,0,19 November 2004
War of the Worlds," The War is On!
","Well the signs going into this movie were pretty good. Critics loved the movie plus we got Spielberg and Cruise teaming up so I was expecting a good one. I t was definitely in my top 10 list of movies to see over the summer.Basically this movie does not go very far from the original version released some decades back. Same plot just updated in terms of time and technology.I always grow tired of movies whose main selling point are the effects. I loved the minimalist special effects in this one. This however is still effective in getting the message of fear and dread across.In terms of the acting, I thought that Dakota Fanning did a great job. It's actually quite hard to believe that she is only 11 years old but can do have a masterful performance. I can still remember the first time I saw her in a episode of CSI some years back and she has certainly progressed since then. I thought that Tom Cruise did a good enough of a job as the caring father trying to protect his children Nothing extraordinary but just enough. Nothing much to say about supporting other than that Tim Robbins should have been given longer screen time.I also quite liked the way they were able to put across the theme on family relations and how it is tested in stressful situations.I guess my main gripe and I fell that many will feel this too is that the end came rather abruptly and that how it was all resolved just felt unsatisfactory.",8,63,130,29 June 2005
Man on Fire," It was an ok movie nothing great!
","Well I came into this movie with very little expectations and knowledge over the basic plot. Unlike the other movies which were heavily promoted this one came in with a little hype and fanfare.I was rather surprised that they would actually pair up the talented Denzel Washington with the promising Dakota Fanning. But it was quite a pleasant team up.I feel that Fanning has continued to grow as an actress ever since I first saw her in an episode of CSI.Denzel being Denzel as usual chose a rather dark character torn by his past and present obligations. At first your see a no nonsense all business man with hints of hurt because of his past. The he becomes a warmer person as he bonds with his ward. Soon of curse we see him change again to this intense and ruthless man bent on revenge. That's what's so good about Denzel is that he is able to easily convert form one character trait to another. I just wish that he would try to get other roles and quit with all this dark characters.I actually found the choreography good at times especially in flashbacks.
I did however found the subtitles a little distracting especially when they would jump up in the middle of a conversation.Also there were quite a few characters which I felt was rather unimportant and were placed in there just to fill in some minutes. Walken's role a fine example of such a character.The score was okay but the acapela female voices were not that effective relative to Ridley Scott's Gladiator.Overall it was a good film from director Ridley Scott. Pretty much worth your money",7,0,0,10 May 2004
The Terminal," Good performance by Hanks!
","The Terminal is the latest movie from Steven Spielberg and stars Ton Hanks, Catherine Zeta Jones and Stanley Tucci. In this movie, which is based on a true story, a man (Hanks) is forced to live in an airport he has just arrived in when political turmoil engulfs his country and his visa is revoked. What happens next is a funny mix of events as he tries to cope with his new home and the people around it. Along the way he encounters the cruel airport manager (Tucci) and a beautiful stewardess (Jones).Well I think the highlight of the movie is definitely the performance of Tom Hanks as Viktor Navorsky. His great Eastern European accent really made him more believable plus of course his usually solid acting. I believe he really carried the whole movie. Stanley Tucci is felt also had a good performance. There is just something about this actor which makes him fit bad guy roles to a T. What I found not very good about the film was the basic screenplay of the movie. Yes it was funny but not much in terms of substance. I also felt they could have shown more of the interaction between Viktor & Amelia. C'mon 20-25 minutes is definitely not enough. The sub-plots were OK but again perhaps less of that could have been included.",8,1,2,9 November 2004
The Bourne Supremacy," Good enough
","I didn't really think too much of the first movie, so I was rather surprised that they came up with a sequel. Somehow I think this movie is very similar to the first so much that perhaps they could have merged the two and form one movie. So much so that a lot of the unresolved elements of Identity took up most of this one. Of course this meant that there was only a little time for the newly introduced characters.There was that little tremor at the start of the movie which really surprised me. I thought that was a good touch that made me more interested in the movie. I just wish they had it a little more into the middle of the film rather than where it was.In terms of action I thought the action scenes were just as good as the first. It was sufficient but nothing much to crow about. I however still cannot get used to the fact that Matt Damon can do an effective enough job as an action star.",7,0,2,19 November 2004
Shark Tale," Disney - Pixar = Shark Tale
","Since this animated movie did come from Dreamworks the same company that made Shrek than it cannot be avoided that I compare the two. This movie just didn't have the same 'enjoyment factor' as Shrek. The humor was not as good and the characters were not as lovable.Frankly the only character that I liked in the movie was that of Oscar (will Smith). The rest were just dull considering that this was a comedy. I thought the most disappointing character was that of Jack Black. He did a great job in School of Rock and I was expecting more of the same in this one but got very little of his wisecracks and antics. Perhaps it was a miscast and another actor could have been drafted in.I also felt that some of the characters were given less than desirable amount of screen time. I guess this was an effect if studios loading their cast with many star names with an eye to using this as marketing tool to sell the movie. I definitely would rather have had less stars but it would have meant more screen time for the main characters.In terms of the animation, I'm not really as astonished with the quality of the animation. Yes perhaps it may have the same quality as previous films like Shrek or Finding Nemo but given that almost everyone is using this technique it now looks all so ordinary. If this movie were done a few years /months ago then I would definitely be raving about the animation.",7,0,3,8 February 2005
Dodgeball," You ought to dodge this movie
","In Dodgeball, a gym is about to close down unless sit can come up with $10,000 to pay off a debt. With the help of many odd characters who frequent the gym the owner must join a Dodgeball tourney. In their way are a team from a rival gym who are out to close out the gym.There really isn't that much to talk about this film in terms of the story. The story as expected was rather thin. There really was no story to talk about.The gags and jokes I thought were unoriginal and pretty lame. I'm not really a fan of Ben Stiller as I do not really agree with him in terms of what is funny and what is not. This movie just reminded me too much of BASEkeball which I really did not enjoy. I guess one the only thing that I thought that helped this movie were the cameos played out by many stars.",6,1,2,13 January 2005
The Island," Stuck on Michael Bay's Island
","The Island is the newest action movie from director Michael Bay, the guy who made Pearl Harbour and The Rock. This time he tackles a utopian community where one by one people are sent to 'The Island' a place where free from contamination, which seems to have engulfed the world. Lincoln Six Echo however begins to question life in the colony and soon discovers that there is more to the Island than it seems.Well generally films by Bay are high on action but does poorly in terms of the screenplay. Well for this one there was still a lot of action especially in the second half of the film. However the screenplay has improved for this one. The screenplay on this one is actually pretty smart even if the concept was unoriginal given the track record of Bay.I thought the acting of the main characters was sufficient enough. Ewan McGregor did a good enough of a job. He did a good job in some of the lighter moments of the film. Scarlett Johansson who was great in Lost in Translation does not shine in this one as basically her role takes a back seat to McGregor's character. Sean Bean as usual performed well as the bad guy.One thing I was rather disturbed about was the rather blatant 'product placement' in the film. It was like they were shoving the brands down your throat instead of it placing it more subtly in the background.Also some of the other actors who were given top billing I thought were under utilized in this movie. The story really revolves on Lincoln Six Echo with bits and pieces of the others.",7,2,5,22 July 2005
