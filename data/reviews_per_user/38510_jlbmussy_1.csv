Requiem for a Dream," Shockingly good
","I'll start with a negative and move on. The plot summery of this movie didn't appeal to me. Generally I find movies where characters either lose their mind or become drug dependent unpleasant to watch so I avoid. Given the good ratings though I put this aside and gave it ago. I'm glad I did. This movie is incredible. The first 15/20 minutes I did find a bit slow but that's just me. I need to be hooked from the offset otherwise I start drifting. Once the story developed I found every second compelling. The visual effects are neat and adds to stimulate your own mind rather than the film itself. This film is clever in that it puts you in the mind of the character and you understand every thought they are thinking. By the end of this movie I was so engulfed and on the edge of my seat. Each character faces horrific circumstances but hey isn't this the moral of the story to brainwash the fact that drugs are bad. I enjoyed this film so much I watched the whole lot again immediately after, also taking in the first 15 minutes which I regrettably drifted from the first time round. Highly recommended",10,0,1,7 August 2015
