The King's Speech," The Story of a King Who was destined for greatness. But needed a little help getting there.
",The King's Speech is one of the greatest films I have ever seen. It is a modern day classic. The Story takes place over a number of years. The Duke of York has a stammer and he hates speaking in public. His father King George the V bullies him into it as it is one of his duties. Bertie as the Duke is called is filled with fear every time he is called to do so. His wife Elizabeth takes matters into her own hands and locates a man who might help him. Lionel Logue is a would be actor who helps people overcome speech difficulties. His methods are unique. Logue however doesn't get pushed very easily nor is he impressed easily. In their first meeting he Tells Bertie after Bertie tries to push Royal attitude on him Logue smiles and tells him My Castle my rule. This sets up the ground work for their relationship. Logue informs him he will need to see him everyday. The next few years are filled with historical life changing events. Bertie is thrust into a situation he doesn't want. King George V is dying and his brother who is having a affair with a divorced woman Wallis Simpson is chosen to be the next King.

As Bertie assumes the throne his relationship with Logue changes and Berties discovers just how much help he really needs and not just with his speech. England is about to go to War. And The newly Crowned King must make a speech. The Speech is to unite England as one and to spur them onto victory. The First Speech becomes a incredible success. And King George the 6th becomes a symbol of resistance against the Nazi war machine. I was surprised to find out that King George the 6th and Logue continued their friendship. This movie made me feel like cheering in the end and it kept my attention and to be honest I Will watch it again. If you like Historical movies that inspire then this one is for you.,10,0,1,11 July 2012
The Avengers," Avengers assemble
","The Avengers is a fan's dream come true. Five years fives films and the most incredible build up in film history leading to this the most ambition filled film ever. It could've fallen flat on it's face. But the film makers who made it clearly love the heroes involved and wanted to show it in terms of story and character development. Joss Whedon takes his time in letting the film unwind and he let's action show up when it's needed. The Action stunts and CGI all take a backseat to the story and acting which is great. Whedon lets the characters speak for themselves and let's the story develop at it's own pace. Which is important because all of that leads to the incredible action packed climax. The interaction between the heroes shows them bonding and feeling each other out as well as rising to the menace which leads to the formation of the Avengers. The story ties up dangling plot lines from the other Marvel films and comes up with a plot that demands the Avengers. S.H.I.E.L.D is experimenting with the tesseract a cube of awesome power when Loki Thor's half brother enters our world and after a battle with Nick Fury and his forces Loki takes the tesseract and leaves taking with him some converts. His plan is to use the Tesseract to open a gateway to let a hostile alien force invade Earth and once Earth is taken down he will step in and Rule it. Nick Fury quickly puts the Avengers plan into action and calls forth Captain America,Iron Man,The Black Widow,Thor, And The Hulk to help find Loki and to battle whatever Evil he is about to unleash. Some bumpy moments happen along the way until they finally form as a team with Hawkeye lending a hand. If You're a comic book fan this is a supreme moment of triumph for you. If you're not then this film will be another one in a long line of action films based on a comic book that's worth seeing.",10,2,6,5 May 2012
Changeling," What do you do when you have nothing left but hope and a will to keep on.
","Changeling borrows it's title from the old George C Scott horror movie my wife didn't want to see it because she got the films mixed up she didn't want to see a horror movie. Changeling is another type of horror film. As a parent of two young boys This movie hit me deeply where I lived. The Story is a matter of fact In Los Angles March of 1928 christine Collins a phone operater supervisor came home after working a Overtime shift to find her son Walter Collins age nine missing. She phones the police only to find a police department that not only doesn't care but is useless. The Cops come out only after she pleads with them they inform her 24 hours must pass before Walter can be considered missing.when the cops come out they find Nothing. the trail is Stone cold. Christine Collins is understandably angry and scared while the police seem to not be able to do anything nor do they even seem to care if she finds her son. during this time she finds at first a strange ally in rev.Gustav Briegleb Wonderfully played by John Malkovich He actually is one of the film's Biggest saving graces. Briegleb is the Reverand of a church but while he serves the community he makes it clear his mission is to bring down the Corrupt LAPD his church prays for Christine Collins to find her son. A Tale Briegleb uses on his nightly Radio broadcasts. Then Five months later a boy calling himself Walter Collins is found and brought home. One Problem the boy is not her son and the LAPD begins to browbeat her into accepting the boy as hers. Christine Collins and Briegleb soon create a problem for the LAPD the police force is full of arm breakers and gunmen with no real detectives on the force they see no end to the problem except one admit her to a insane asylum before she goes nation wide and becomes more of a problem and a liability for the LAPD. She has Embarrassed them plenty and that they will not take lightly. Meanwhile a LAPD Detective on a routine case finds out about a murder spree of Young Boys committed by Gordon Northcott and his Young Nephew one of the victims may be Walter Collins the horror of this case causes him to buck the system and to try and bring Northcott to justice, Eastwood directs with a strong firm hand and Angela Jolie does a outstanding job in what may very well be the best performance of her career. The movie is filled with suspense Horror anger and love and it ends on a note of Hope. This as I told my wife may very well be one of the best movies I have ever seen. Simply put Eastwood delivers a classic picture.",10,3,5,7 September 2009
Men in Black 3," to understand the future ,we got to go back in time.
",Men In Black III is a enjoyable film.This may be the most emotional one of the three and by far the best one story wise.The movie begins with the escape of Boris the animal from the lunar prison colony. Boris has only one thing in mind. Killing Agent K for taking his right arm 40 years ago and spoiling a invasion.Boris is the last of his kind thanks to K spoiling the invasion.There is only one way to make things right again Boris goes back in time to kill Agent K.Meanwhile Agent J is wondering at why K is so distant and cold. 14 years together and being friends hasn't shaken that stony Armour so J begins to work on K who simply tells him. 'Don't ask questions you don't want to know the answers to.'They got their work to keep them warm but J is worried about K.Meanwhile MIB has a new commander in Chief a agent by the name of O has replaced Z.O will not give J any information on K's background about why he'so moody and distant. She repeats K's line and it bugs him.K's background is classified and J can't find any answers that way.Then the impossble happens. Agent K disappears it seems he was murdered 40 years ago and for some reason only agent J remembers him.Agent O believes J has lost his mind until he convinces her he isn't crazy. She then tells J there is one way and that is time travel. Go back in time and save K.There is only one person in Manhattan who has access to a time machine and when J goes back in time and Meets a young Agent K played remarkably well by Josh Brolin. In fact Brolin's performance is one of the film's highlights. We get to see the MIB operate in the late 60's 1969 to be precise. And it's a treat. And for J to be teamed up with a Young Agent K is fantastic. Needless to say K and J are successful mission accomplished and J finds out about K's deep dark hidden secret and his greatest failure.We find out more about our favourite men in black and that's just fine.This movie has to be the best one yet in the series. I hope they make more. Or get Josh Brolin his own franchise as Young Agent K. Worth seeing.,10,2,6,3 June 2012
Walk the Line," Rebel Outlaw Visionary Singer Legend.
",Walk the line follows the same path as Ray does in telling the story of a larger then life icon. And in this case the story is the almost mythic story of Johnny Cash who approved of James mangold's script and he even spent time with Phoenix talking to him. Phoenix was Cash's first and only choice as to who would play him in the movie. Wise choice. The Wisest choice was June Carter's when she chose Reese Witherspoon to portray her. Both icons chose not to try and influence them when it came to the singing Johnny Cash told Phoenix relax find your own way it'll sound more better more real that way. And it does sound more real. Mangold pulls no punches here he delivers Johnny Cash warts and all as he struggles with the loss of an older brother loniness in the air force and finally a addiction to booze and pills that almost kills him. But for all of that WALK THE LINE is just a simple love story of Cash's love for June carter and the battles they had to fight before they could be together. And WALK THE LINE could also be called a love letter by James Mangold to the late Johhny Cash and the late June Carter Cash. The movie is the Johnny Cash Story and it details his life with unflinchingly honesty much like Johnny Cash did in real life. This movie is a classic that deserves to be viewed again and again.,Null,0,0,18 July 2008
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A long time ago in a galaxy far far away.
",STAR WARS EPISODE ONE: THE PHANTOM MENACE. cue the John Williams theme music. George Lucas gives us a fantastic look at how the story begins.We meet Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn and his padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi We see the beginning of the Empire in the way events are manipulated the story unfolds in it's own time nothing is rushed. every thing means something and it blends together beautifully. Liam Neeson is simply the whole movie Darth Maul's evil look might've been a publicist's dream but Qui gon jinn is the heart of the movie and Ewen Macgregor simply wonderful as Kenobi. The movie never earned all the basing it got it's about as wonderful a time as you will ever have reliving your childhood or watching a grand adventure movie. The Phantom menace is one of the best in this genre .,10,40,63,14 November 2010
The Expendables 2," Track Em. Find Em. Kill Em..
",The Expendables II is a fantastic action film. It delivers what the first one only hinted at. The film opens up with the Expendables rescuing a Japanese businessman and their old friend Trench. From there we meet the newest Expendable a very young and able kid. Billy the Kid. He's a expert sniper and cool under fire. The team likes him and Barney Ross Treats him like billy is his kid. There is a Clichéd scene where Billy hands in his resignation as this life isn't for him. He goes on one last mission. Mr.Church blackmails the expendables to go and find a crashed air plane that has a valueable safe on board. they are joined by Church's agent Maggie. She has the codes to open the safe. What's inside the safe is the map of a old Russian base where 5 tons of plutonium was buried. They get the map and are ambushed by Jean Villain wonderfully play by Jean Claude Van Damme. His men hold Billy hostage and force them to give up the map. Afterwards they Kill Billy. And The Expendables make this a personal mission. It doesn't matter that the madman has enslaved a whole town and forced the men to dig for the plutonium. It Doesn't matter that he's planning to sell it to the highest bidder. What Does matter is that he kill their friend. So they're going to kill him. When the action gets hot and they're outnumbered they get a assist from an old Friend Booker. I just want to say this. Chuck Norris still has it. Seeing him interact with Stallone and Company was worth the price of the ticket. Along the way Villain's Army outnumbers them and they get help from Mr.Church and Trench. The Cliamax is fast Action packed and you relive the days of your youth watching these guys go to work. It's a great feeling seeing these guys do this. The Film is clichéd in some scenes. But they make it work. In the end to boil it down to it's basic core is this. The Good Guy's against the bad guys. The Good Guys win. With a lot of style hot hardcore action. And Witty one liners. The Expendables II will not win any Oscars. It's not going to change the world or cure cancer. But it'll take you back in time to when these stars were our heroes and the best in the business. This film is going to do what it sets out to do. Entertain you. That's all. Shut your brain off sit back and be prepared to enjoy yourself. If you enjoyed any movies in which these gentlemen starred in. You will enjoy this. If you didn't then This is not the film for you. Stay away then. But for those who are pure action fans. This film was made for you.,10,1,6,22 August 2012
Skyfall," James Bond returns home.
",Skyfall takes Bond in a new direction. His past. The plot is a 007 plot. A Enemy kills a agent who has a disc containing the names of MI6 agents under cover. James Bond and another Agent Eve. Are dispatched to save the agent and recover the disc. They fail and Bond is left for dead. However once the disc is in the Enemy's hands he releases the names and pictures of the agents. the Agents are found and killed and still the mystery man threatens to reveal more names and pictures. Then he bombs the MI6 headquarters And M figures it out the enemy was once one of them. Think back on your sins he tells her. M is now under fire from the prime minsters office and is given three months to retire. Her Replacement Sir Gareth Mallory is more then willing to be helpful but he also Tells M her time is over. As things get desperate. James Bond returns from the dead ready to take on the newest enemy for His country. When the enemy is revealed to be Roual Silvia a Agent once favoured by M. Who gave him up when his actions got to be too dangerous. Silvia was tortured and left for dead as well but he came back twisted and hungry for revenge. It is a plan that'll force Both Bond and M to confront their pasts. While trying to build their futures. And it might cost them everything.SKYFALL. While not the most original story in the Bondseries is compelling because we get a glimpse of Bond's past. Things the books hinted about are revealed here. This might be the most personal Bond film since on her majesty's secret service. And Daniel Craig nails the Role of James Bond perfectly. There are no more comparisons to Sean Connery. The Role is Craig's. He is now just as good as Connery was. And the real beauty of SKYFALL is that while it's a JAmes Bond Reboot. The Ending sets us up for the more traditional James Bond Universe that we all know and love. I enjoyed Skyfall greatly simply because I've seen every 007 movie ever made from Barry Nelson's Casino Royale to Skyfall itself. And all I've got to say is it's a film all Bond fans will like. Some say it's boring some say it's awful. I say watch it and make up your own mind.,Null,3,8,27 September 2013
Iron Man 3," I Am Tony stark and I am also Iron Man. The man makes the suit.
","I saw Iron Man 3 last night I took my wife to see it because she is a huge RDJ fan. I consider this film the best of the series simply because it takes risks. Yes there are changes notable changes. That differ largely from the comics version. The Fact is the changes made in this film only serve to make it better. There were major changes in The Avengers film and Captain America and Thor. Yet those changes only served to make the film better. The story this time around is After the events of The Avengers Tony Stark is falling apart. He can't sleep and suffers panic attacks. The Events of the battle of New York and his trip into the alien dimension and the fact that he died. All of these things weigh heavily on him. Tony spends his time making more Iron Man Armor. Pepper is still CEO of Stark industries and Tony's best friend and one time body guard Happy Hogan is now head of security. Happy is paranoid of every new face, When Aldrich Killian meets with Pepper to show off his company's new break through a virus he calls Extremis. Extremis can map the brain and fill in the gaps and improve on them. One of the ways Extremis works is it can take the body's healing process and magnify it by a hundred times making the body heal itself at a rapid pace. More then that there are other ways Extermis can make itself useful. The film after the introduction of Extremis and Killian goes into overdrive It has twists and turns and spectacular stunts. But most of all it has a story . One that leaves you guessing. Sure it's Not the comic book. But where does it say that it has to reproduce the comic book down to the last detail. The Character of the Mandarin is the biggest dividing factor here. At one point I could see why true fans are upset. and on the other side I was thinking what a original take on the character. Iron Man 3 won't win any Oscars. but in the entertainment side of things it does that wonderfully. the one thing that surprised me and made me enjoy it more was more Tony Stark and less Iron Man. This film puts Tony Stark into a James Bond type of adventure. Shane Black breathes new life into the Golden Avenger. And while I loved Faverou's take on Iron Man. I didn't miss his touch on this one at all. that doesn't mean I didn't like Faverou that's far from the truth I loved his Faverou's take on Iron Man very much. Iron Man 3 has a different tone and a different feel to it making it the best in the series. And that's not bad. It makes me want to see how Iron Man 4 and Avengers II are going to turn out.",Null,0,2,12 May 2013
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The Adventure movie that kickstarted a whole genre.
",Raiders of the lost ark is a timeless classic. there now with that said and out of the way I can honestly say I feel that way because Raiders of the lost ark is perhaps the only movie that doesn't promise you anything but it gives you everything a movie lover wants. Clearly George Lucas and Spielberg's love affair with the old serials and old comic books paid off big. This movie is a homage to a age we will never see again the real golden age of movie making. Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones forget the casting of Tom Selleck Selleck could not have pulled it off as well as Ford. Spielberg remarked that they needed a actor of the level of Bogart who both said would've been perfect for the role of Indy. I could see Bogart playing Indiana Jones and Grace Kelly or Lauren Bacall playing Marion Ravenwood while Errol Flynn could've chewed the scenery as Belloq or maybe Rathbone being Belloq. This movie is timeless and any cast from the golden age of Hollywood would've done justice to it. This movie needs to be in every serious movie lover's collection.,10,1,2,26 February 2008
Star Trek," These are the voyages of the starship ENTERPRISE
",When I first saw Star Trek the series I became a fan this was back in 1973 or so. Then in 1979 they made the first ever star trek the motion picture a little confusing to my nine year old brain but it was entertaining it had Kirk Spock Mccoy and the rest and I loved it and all the other Trek films that followed. Then came Star Trek GENERATIONS. They killed off Captain James T. Kirk in that one and some of the magic died for me at least. The next generation films while good and enjoyable were forgotten after leaving the theater. Then Came Star Trek 2009 a massive reboot or a incredible revamping of the original series. I saw it and loved it . It brought back the magic of the original for me yes their are differences Spock and Uhura dating Vulcan meeting it's fate and James T.Kirk aboard the Enterprise but not as a captain not even as a crewman. JJ Abrams takes the Trek story and runs in different directions with it and has fun making this film and it shows. The Cast has fun and it shows this film has a heart and it has the imagination to create a newer beginning for a newer Trek generation this is not your father's Star Trek it's Yours make of that what you will. Chris Pine creates a rebel James T. Kirk at war with the universe and trying to prove himself. Spock is the half breed trying to overcompansate for the weaker human blood in his DNA makeup until he realizes That it makes all the difference and it makes him Better. Mccoy is the Country Docter caught up in Kirk's Whirlwind life and becomes his best friend and later on Spock's best friend as well. Mccoy sees things from a different perspective and is able to comment on it. This movie has so much going for it so much Action so much character development so much comedy and again so much imagination in telling a complicated story But not making it overly complicated that the audience can follow along. in my theater the audience gave this film a standing ovation. This movie gives us a new course to set on and a universe of newer stories to tell. This movie needs to be seen and once you see it you'll understand why a reboot was needed and why it saved Star Trek.,Null,1,10,26 May 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Taratino and World War II what more can anyone ask?
","Inglourious Basterds is NOT an accurate war picture there is no historical facts here whatsoever except that WWII did happen and Adolph Hitler did exist. One does not look for facts in a John Wayne World War II film one should not do so here.Brad Pitt plays Lt.Aldo Raine a man sent to create a squad of Eight Jewish-American soldiers to take with him behind enemy lines in a effort to shake up the German high command before the D-Day landing. Raine is part Apache and he designs his operation along the lines of a apache war party hit run and disappear. Now he also tells his men that the Nazis are not human do not treat them as such kill anything wearing a uniform in such a manner that it'll deliver a message to the German high command in their nightmares. That said Lt. Aldo Raine informs his men that they ow him one hundred Nazi scalps and he wants his scalps.Flashforward a few months later the basterds have become legend their names whispered thru out Europe Aldo The Apache the Bear Jew and the Little man are just part of the legend that Hitler wants stamped out. He's angry and frustrated these men are now myths one of them the Bear Jew is reported to be a golem.During this time the British government launch operation Kino a suicide mission of sorts it appears that Germany has a New Sgt, York in Young Fredrick Zoeller a young man whom Gobbels has just made a movie about starring him it's called the pride of a nation and Gobbels wants to launch it at a fantastic premiere with the Entire German high Command in attendance. The Basterds are drafted into helping operation Kino succeed or die trying.The rest of the movie introduces us to SS Colonel Hans Landa a slimy soldier who is good at his job but may be a little bit too greedy for his own goodThings go wrong as they often do in these types of war films and the Basterds have to salvage the operation and make it succeed or die trying.Brad Pitt gives the best acting performance of his life here. There is no Brad Pitt movie star instead he is replaced By Lt.Aldo Raine and Pitt saves this movie from becoming just another average war flick.Well worth seeing if only for Pitt's Aldo Raine alone.",10,0,8,13 February 2010
Iron Man 2," I am Iron Man the suit and I are one.
",Iron Man 2 starts off where the first one left off and hits the ground running from there. Tony Stark is a national icon Iron Man is seen by a grateful American public as a protector. The government sees the armour as a weapon of mass power that should not be in the hands of just one man. Then there is Justin Hammer a Business rival of Tony Stark's who is obsessed with creating his own Iron Man armour and mass producing it. the Trouble is this the tech used for Iron Man is so superior to anything out there that Stark figures it will take at least twenty years to create an armour like his. Tony is living large and hiding a tragic secret but on top of all of that comes Ivan Vanko or Whiplash armed with tech. Dangerously close to Starks Vanko wants revenge . plus there is betrayal spy work and of course the Black widow wonderfully played by Scarlett Johansson and the ever gruff super spy tough guy legend Nick Fury played by the one and only Sam.L.Jackson. The movie moves at a rocket pace and delivers the acting is solid the story is strong and the story ties up all the loose ends plus gives us more Iron Man and the introduction of War Machine Tony's best friend and fellow crime fighter. Mickey Rouke carries his part with cold sinister menace he and RDJ are the movie and you won't take your eyes off of them. Worth seeing ? YES!,10,4,6,14 May 2010
42," Jackie Robinson was a hero.
",When I heard they were making the Jackie Robinson story I was sure it was going to gloss over the glory and concentrate on the ugly. But I was wrong. It treats every aspect of Robinson's story with respect and it rings true. Robinson broke the colour barrier at the behest of Dodgers manager Branch Rickey. His reason was to end racism in baseball and to find that one player who would give them the world series. Rickey was ahead of his time. and Jackie Robinson was a man at the right place at the right time. Robinson fought back by not fighting back. and in turn he influenced a whole generation of people and made them question their own beliefs. A Victory in itself. Harrison Ford is the show stopper his Branch Rickey is so good It's a shame he wasn't nominated for an Oscar. Ford has rarely been better. Lucas Black as Pee Wee Reese. is outstanding Black is a actor one rarely thinks about. Yet he can do the job. Here he does so effortlessly I will make a attempt to remember his name and check out more of his movies. 42 isn't a feel good movie. It's a honest attempt to tell the truth and it succeeds. And that's good enough for me .,Null,2,2,4 March 2014
Rocky V," Rocky V The measure of a man.
","Rocky V to me is the only Rocky movie that kept the promise and the original concept of Rocky. Rocky two three and four were great films but they moved Rocky too far away from who is was Rocky V fixes that problem. At the End of Rocky 4 we see Rocky is suffering from a Brain Truma inflicted from Drago's Blows Rocky is told he can never fight again and to do so would make him a vegetable. The Heavyweight Championship Title is stripped from him and Rocky announces his retirement. At the next moment he learns that his greedy lawyer has stolen Everything and Rocky is broke. He returns back to his old neighborhood and Rocky who was left Mickey's Gym reopens it and starts training a new generation of fighters Adrian goes back to work in the pet store and Rocky Junior must go to a public school where he must fight for his respect. Everything changes when Rocky is challenged by a dishonest promoter to fight the NEW Champion Union Kane Rocky refuses, At this time Rocky meets a fighter Tommy Gunn who wants him to train and manage him. Rocky begins to get his self respect back as his fighter wins fight after fight and attracts the new Champions attention. Rocky turns down the fight saying Tommy Gunn us not ready and Tommy turns on him. He becomes the Champion and the dishonest promoter becomes his mananger and he Confronts Rocky, A incredible Street Fight ensues and the movie winds down. This one is my favourite of all the Rocky films as it shows Rocky Down but not out. This movie has been unfairly knocked around by everyone from Stallone to the critics and yet it rings so true. Just try it you'll be surprised it's not your normal Rocky film it's better.",10,22,24,23 March 2008
Argo," Argo see it.
",I remember these events as they happened. I was ten years old and I was given my first real taste of fanatics taken to the extreme. Every eye was on Iran for 444 days. the world held it's breath. When The American Embassy was stormed and Hostages taken. The Fanatics demanded the Former Shah sent back to face punishment. The Former Shah was dying of cancer and in No shape to go back. President Carter Refused to deal with them. then There were reports of Six Americans Being smuggled out of Iran. And that was being done by the Canadian Ambassder Ken Taylor. For years afterwards we heard the stories about the bravery of the Canadian government in helping get these Americans home. AndSince Iam A Canadian. The Story rings true. Like I said I lived these events that was one of the topics the school I was in kept talking about. Now I'm long past that I'm a Father now and When My kids read about it in the history books I'm sure it'll be just a great adventure story to them.A Film Like Argo does something different. It transforms it from a great adventure story to a human story. And While it does play fast and loose with the facts. remember that after all this is based on The American's Point of View. The American in point One Tony Mendez. Mendez is a Former C.I.A. Agent and while I don't doubt their bravery in the field I do believe they can stretch the truth a little bit to make themselves look good. But this is a Hollywood film. Taken from the American P.O.V. And while it plays from the American side of things That in itself isn't a bad thing. Ben Affleck is growing as a director. He's done a great job carefully crafting this movie and honing it into a good solid tribute to a time when the world held it's breath. Affleck's Tony Mendez is Sharp witted and he's Very Good at what he does. He's a extraction specialist. Whih means he gets people out of tough spots. This one requires a little more finesse. And when MEndez gets inspiration to make a false film to get them out of their as Members of the false film. The False film is called Argo. A Star Wars Battlestar Galactica Krull Type of movie. They find a Make up who is a part time agent named John Chambers and we find out that The C.I.A. and Hollywood have worked together before. Chambers gets them hooked up with a producer named Siegal who simply demands that if his name is going to be attached to a fake film it'll be a fake film that'll be a hit. They let the media hype go to work and hype it out to the press that Argo is going to be the greatest Sci-fi movie of all time. They get a script made and Story boards drawn and everything is set. Then the action begins.I watched the movie and when the suspenseful parts hit I kept reminding myself the six got out. But Affleck makes you feel every moment of their escape. Some people found it dull. Others a disappointment. Me I found it to be a very good movie I intend to watch again.,10,0,4,7 October 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," beware the wrath of Khan.
","Star Trek : Into Darkness is a re imaging of the Wrath of Khan. And One that stands up there with the original. I found the film to be a thrill ride from start to finish. Here Captain JAmes T. Kirk finally fullfills his potential to be one of the greatest Captains that starfleet has ever produced. Kirk is brave but without humility. Smart but stupid he takes risks without thinking of the consquences. But most of all Kirk doesn't hold to the rules that starfleet has he makes his own. And in this adventure Kirk realizes several truths. Rules are for everyone. And that a Captain is vulnerable because of his Crew. His crew is his family. And Kirk will sacrifice everything for them including breaking all the rules. But what happens when Kirk meets the unstoppable Superman Khan ? For the first time Kirk will find he isn't the greatest at everything and that Khan is a Superman. James T. Kirk will find everything he believes in to be challenged truths will be tested and lies will be found out.Chris Pine brings his A- Game here as he makes the movie his brash swaggering Kirk is the show. Karl Urban brings the heart as his McCoy is still one of the best things about the reboot. Quinto is excellent as Spock torn between rules and reg. and doing what his gut instinct tells him to do. He brings that struggle out perfectly. And Simon Pegg finally gets a chance to shine as Scotty. He's given enough to do and enough to give Scotty a important job in this movie. Ben Cumberbatch is superb as the tortured and yet arrogant Khan who is willing to do whatever is needed to save his people.Star Trek : Into Darkness is neither Dark or gritty. What it is ,is action adventure and a great time at the movies.",Null,2,4,17 June 2013
Public Enemies," We're the John Dillinger gang and we're the best in the business.
",Public Enemies is a beautifully written well acted film that makes you actually long for the long ago days of the dirty thirties where Big Time gangsters roamed the country robbing banks and capturing the public's imagination. Dillinger was often called The Robin Hood of bank robbers and that was because Dillinger saw the people suffer at the hands of the banks and he went out of his way to help them. that's one reason why Dillinger was allowed to run free for so long the public LOVED him. Public Enemies captures this beautifully making Dillinger a public idol and a wanted fugitive at the same time. Mann gets the story almost right he pays attention to the little details such as the Night Dillinger is killed his signal to start was the lighting of his cigar. Christian Bale delivers a powerhouse performance that almost overpowers the Film While Depp simply Is the film. However since this is a Hollywood version of the Dillinger story facts never get in the way of the legend. This is one of the Dillinger films out there worth seeing the other being Dillinger (1973) with Warren Oates as John Dillinger and the 40's film of Dillenger. This now the only third worthwhile film of John Dillinger worth seeing and it paints an incredible picture of Melvin Purvis as a dedicated Agent determined to get John Dillinger. The Era is captured beautifully the details are in place and the story is well written with an incredible cast that is like the Dillinger gang they're the best in the business.,Null,0,1,19 September 2009
That Thing You Do!," That thing you do is a incredible tribute to a long bygone age
",Tom Hanks Outdid himself in 1996 with that thing you do. The story is simple the acting is..Magic. singled out is Liv Taylor for her role as Kay the girlfriend of the leader of the Wonders and as their fame grows She alone Grows up. It's not to the end when Guy Patterson (Nicely played by Tom Everett Scott) Grows up as well. This movie shows us a age that most of us had forgotten or never knew existed to most people the sixties music scene was The Beatles or the British invasion or..Woodstock. Tom Hanks quietly reminds us that this was not so. This is a America where JFK was president Working on Sunday was simply unthinkable and Rock and Roll was starting to come into it's own as The soundtrack for a generation. The story could be clichéd but in Hanks's Able hands it becomes Magic. The local Band needs a drummer after their drummer breaks his hand and so they recruit Guy Patterson the son of a local furniture store owner and Guy a lifelong Jazz fan joins them. The leader is a moody young man named Jimmy and in the Wonders first show his slow Ballad That thing you do is Turned into a Rocking number by Guy and it becomes a Major Fan fave. Soon that Thing you do becomes a hit record and the Wonders MUST adjust to the temptations of fickle fate. Tom Hanks role of the record company talent scout/manager/mentor is wonderfully underplayed This is not his movie and he knows it having written and produced and Directed that thing you do. Hanks knows this movie belongs to the Wonders and he gives them enough room to grow. The music is totally original but sounds as if it came from a Rock-Ola time machine jukebox. Hanks makes no missteps in this one. This is a wonderfully thought out story. This movie was to me a love letter to a bygone age that we will never see again. Thank you Tom Hanks for a Wonderful movie going experience.,Null,0,0,9 November 2008
Fast & Furious 6," All Roads lead to this.
","Fast and Furious 6.Well the movie carries one hell of a explosive punch. The Stunts are top notch. The Acting is petty good. If you are a fan of the Fast and Furious franchise you'll consider this one of the best in the series. If you are not a fan you won't be pleased . simple as that. I like this franchise. Right from the first one to this one. I consider them to be examples of high action and adventure done in a classic way. The story is simple. Supercop Hobbs is chasing a criminal named Shaw. Shaw uses a crew like Dom's to perform impossible robberies. Shaw is the master of the roads. Hobbs finds out that Shaw's Second in Command is Dom's lost love Letty long presumed dead. When Shaw and his crew steal a high tech Chip. Hobbes goes to Rio and recruits Dom and his team with a promise of a full pardon for them. So they can return Home. Dom pulls his team together and they get to work bring down Shaw. The theme of Fast and Furious that has been constant is family. And it is strongly put into play with this film. As Dom tells Brian. 'You don't turn your back on family. Even when they turn their back on you.' For Brian it's about getting a dangerous criminal off the streets and returning home. For Dom it's about putting his family together and resuming his life back in L.A. But it's also for Dom about the truth. nothing else matters. The film is sleek . And well done ,It's done with a style and flair you will enjoy. That is if you are a fan. If you're not a fan well check this film out anyways. It's also one hell of a crime noir film . You can forget the cars and you still have a well written well acted crime film. Vin Diesal gives a pretty sharp performance as Dom as always. Paul Walker provides the moral compass of the family. And Dwayne Johnson Provides the spark that gets them into action. Each actor in this film knows his or her job. The film ties in Fast and Furious :Tokyo drift. And it sets up the next one. The series as a whole fits into one whole story. A very impressive feat. Like I said if you're a fan of the franchise you'll enjoy it. If you're not Fan well give it a chance anyways. If you want to be surprised.",Null,0,2,18 December 2013
The Expendables," a great movie they don't make them like this anymore too bad.
",The Expendables is a throwback to the golden age of the action movie the 80's. The Story is simple Barney Ros leads a group of Mercs called the expendables if you got the right money you can hire them. Ross and company have just finished a mission and fired one of their own for conduct unbecoming The Man Gunner Jenson wonderfully played by Dolph Lundgren has become too messed up he's stoned or as Lee Christmas Ross's Right hand man says the life got to him. The Expendables are given a contract to go to the island of Vilena to take out a Corrupt leader so Ross and Christmas go and do a re con and meet a woman named Sandra who is their contact she takes them on a guided tour of Hell. Suddenly everything goes wrong and Ross And Christmas must battle their way out of there when Sandra is captured. The Expendables also find out the truth they were offered a contract to take out a rogue CIA agent named Jack Monroe played with great effect by Eric Roberts. Monroe and the General have turned the island into their own drug production factory the CIA can t have the embarrassment of one of their own turning rogue and becoming a drug kingpin so they hired them to kill him. But Ross turns it down he does not want to get involved with the CIA again. But he can't get Sandra off of his mind and the nobility she displayed so in a effort to save what's left of his soul the Expendables return to the island. But not before a fantastic battle occurs between Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren in one of the best filmed action scenes of the movie. The Film 's climatic ending left me cheering and I also felt Stallone has grown as a writer and a director. He gives us a scene that 20 years ago would not have been filmed in which Ross meets Monroe's Hench man Paine played with bad intentions by Steve Austin Paine beats him in a fight and when Christmas asks him what he's doing Ross replies Getting my ass kicked. Something Stallone would've never done 20 years ago back then he had to win every fight now he's allowing others that right in his movies. the Expendables is not the greatest film ever made nor is it the worst but to a real action fan it's pure gold.,10,3,7,14 October 2010
The Town," Pure Cinematic Gold.
",THE TOWN is a great heist film by Ben Affleck. Affleck starts out by laying out some basic facts here which sets up the movie nicely. It States that Charlestown has created more bank robbers and armed robbers then anywhere else.The beginning starts off with Doug McRay going over the plans to rob a bank. When they break into the bank as soon as it opens Doug and his partners force the bank manager a lovely young lady named Claire to open the safe.

The Gang take her hostage. To guarantee their safety. They blindfold her and take her driver's licence. They inform her that someone will hold onto it and will watch her in case she tries to talk to the F.B.I or the Cops.Doug doesn't like how the gang treated her and takes the licence. What begins as a simple job of watching her becomes complex when Doug falls in love with her. Claire falls in love with him and Doug gets pulled into another Job. Against his will and better judgement. Doug takes the Job. Warning them that if anything goes wrong he warned them. The Job goes badly and they almost get caught.

The Story could be considered Clichéd. But Affleck puts enough fresh touches to it to make it feel new. The film succeeds in what it sets out to do. Entertain you. Ben Affleck shows off the talent he showed back in Good Will Hunting. He can write. We knew that. Now we find out he can direct. And THE TOWN. is proof of that.,10,3,5,13 August 2012
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain America VS S.H.I.E.L.D.
",Captain America:The Winter Soldier starts the new marvel era off with a lot of action. Winter Soldier takes the classic Nick Fury VS S.H.I.E.L.D story from the 80's and gives it a good sharp twist and makes it a Captain America Story. But one that travels the Marvel universe. S.H.I.E.L.D has been infiltrated by HYDRA. the entire organization has been taken over and on the eve of SHIELD'S biggest plan for world security . they plan to launch three helicarrier drones. Each Drone has the firepower to decimate a country. When a tense conversation with Captain America leaves Nick Fury thinking he tries to go into his files to find out more. Only to find out someone has blocked all access. Fury is targeted for termination. When he very narrowly escapes an attempt on his life he goes to the apartment of Steve Rogers. And asks for Captain America'a help. Fury is attacked in cap's apartment by a shadowy assassin called the Winter Soldier. He's as fast as Captain America and as strong with one cybernetic arm. And the Soldier is totally ruthless. As Fury lies dying in Cap's apartment he gives him a flash drive containing all of SHIELD'S secrets and tells him to trust no one. Cap takes Fury to the Hospital and contacts the Black Widow who was close to Fury. As the two heroes watch over Fury. Cap is ordered to SHIELD just as Fury dies. Steve hides the flash drive and goes over to see SHIELD'S Director Alexander Pierce. It is here Steve learns of how far Hydra's reach is. Steve is questioned by Pierce. When Pierce isn't satisfied with the answers to His questions he orders Steve Rogers killed.. Steve fights his way out of SHIELD. With only the Widow for help Steve must find out the answer to what Hydra is up to And to stop it. He also must confront the Winter Soldier again. Steve and the Widow recruit Sam Wilson a highly skilled former soldier code named the Falcon for good reasons. As Cap gets closer to the truth. And as he assembles his allies to take out SHIELD. He finds out the sinister truth about Who the Winter Soldier is.CAPTAIN America : THE WINTER SOLDIER . is a fine action story that puts super heroes into a world best occupied by James Bond. and makes it work. Stay for the after credit scenes. And you'll find out just how far the ripples of this film go. A high degree of writing and skillful direction moves this film above the rest of the marvel films. Add in some fine acting and you got a great popcorn film. the Only Drawback to me was Robert Redford. While Redford is great as Pierce. It seems as if they ran out of things for him to do in this film. which is a shame. Redford adds a lot of class to this production. And he underacts to his credit which gives his scenes with Samuel L. Jackson's Fury a bigger and better dimension. After All His Pierce isn't a screaming Villain from the old cliffhangers who rub their hands and cackle in evil delight. He's a man of this age and this century who knows how to do things skillfully and hide them in plain view. All in All Winter Soldier is the best Marvel film released thus far. And that's saying something.,10,5,10,21 April 2014
Over the Top," Lincoln Hawk has a strong right arm and a stronger dream to be with his son.
",Over The Top is Stallone's shining moment in the late eighties when he proved to everybody he didn't need to carry a Gun or a set of boxing gloves. Over The Top was one of his greatest roles ever his Lincoln Hawk is a truck driver who left his wife and son for reasons of his own but he never forgot them and he kept in contact with them as the boy grew. However The Boy's Wealthy Grandfather never forgave his wife for marrying beneath her class and never forgave Hawk for leaving them Jason Cutler has spent the past ten years poisoning his grandson against his father. When Lincoln Hawk shows up one day to pick his son up from military school and to drive him to see his dying wife in the hospital Hawk wants to establish a relationship with his son. Meanwhile he nourishes a secret dream of his own. To enter the Las Vegas Arm Wrestling Championship to win the Title and a Brand new Semi. That's the story in a nutshell The Acting is good and very well done Stallone breaks out of his action imposed exile long enough to remind us that he is a very good actor Robert Loggia delivers a hateful performance as Jason Cutler a man who doesn't like to lose and wants to destroy Hawk at all costs even at the expense of his grandson's love. The Late Rick Zumwalt is the one of the reason's the movie has stood out so well his Bull Harley is one of the most memorable character I have seen Bull is not a villain but he's not a good Guy either he's just a working man looking out for himself in a world that won't look out for him. The Story is nothing earth shaking original it's old and Time worn and Cliché after cliché the movie is a cliché Heaven but the movie makers cared enough to add some touches that make it stand out and put together a Fantastic Cast that makes you care about them and worry bout them. Not a Classic movie by any means but it should be a contender. A good strong family movie for the whole family.,Null,2,4,23 April 2008
Rocky II," Rocky Two The legend continues
",Rocky two picks up almost at the same second the last one leaves off. Rocky has been hurt badly and retires from boxing and marries Adrian and settles down. He quickly spends his fight money buying things that they want a house a car and other expenses. Apollo Creed on the other hand is humiliated beyond belief his fight with Rocky is met with scorn from his fans and Apollo wants Rocky back in the ring for a rematch for the Title. Rocky soon is broke and trying to find a real job and Adrian gets pregnant. Apollo begins a harsh campaign to draw Rocky back into the ring and suddenly everything falls apart for Rocky. Rocky accepts to fight Apollo and Adrian gives birth prematurely and lapses into a coma. Rocky questions himself and wonders if fighting Apollo is what he really should be doing. Adrian recovers and tells him to win and Rocky trains and meets Apollo for one last chance at heavyweight Glory. Now the Story is not original but Stallone breathes fresh life into it and makes it seem fresh. This is the Story most Rocky fans remember fondly and this is the story most Rocky fans Wanted. A worthy sequel to Rocky well worth seeing as it never lets you down and it brings you up cheering at the end.,10,0,0,23 March 2008
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Anakin Skywalker begins his rise to the Dark side.
",Star Wars II attack of the clones is a nicely done film. George Lucas once said he saw the three films as part of a biography in the life of Anakin Skywalker. Episode one: The Phantom Menace introduces us to Anakin Skywalker a boy who may or may not be the chosen one. But Anakin is strong in the force and at the end he becomes a Jedi PAdawan.Episode II Attack of the Clones is the love episode it sets up the Love Story between Anakin and Padme the former queen of naboo and sets in motion the evil plan of the mad Sith lord Palpatine it begins Anakin's March to the Dark side.Episode III Revenge of the Sith is the story of HOW Anakin Skywalker BECOMES Darth Vader.That said Attack of the clones is a beautiful film and it adds to the Star Wars legend nicely. There is literally no wasted scenes the film runs along with the speed of lightening and it keep you entertained and at the same time keeps you well informed of what is going on. This movie is the Heart and center of the Star Wars Story and does not deserve the bad reviews it got. just watch it and see.,10,4,7,27 November 2010
Captain America: The First Avenger," 1941 A World at war and Steve Rogers is about to become Captain America.
","CAPTAIN America. is that rare film that makes you feel good. the story follows the comic book. The Story is this. 1943 America is at war and the United States government is banking every thing on the Super Soldier formula. Steve Rogers is the test subject who was selected out of a small group of men to test the formula. The Serum works and Rogers becomes the world's first American Super soldier. Then a German spy kills the inventor of the serum and Rogers goes after the killer when he does so in public and pictures are taken of him the Government decides he would be more useful selling War Bonds on a USO tour. Rogers is angry because this is not what he believes he was given the super soldier serum for. Then he finds out a friend of his Bucky Barnes is trapped behind enemy lines along with most of his unit. Steve Rogers now code named Captain America disobeys orders and rescues Bucky and the Howling commandos. once he does this the government sees the worth in him fighting the battles that need to be fought. His greatest challenge is the evil mad Red Skull who was given a earlier version of the serum which disfigured him and gave him immense power. The rest of the film is the conflict between the Red Skull and Captain America and how Cap is trying to stop the Skull's ultimate plan to destroy the allied forces. It Ends up with Captain America defeating the Red Skull only to be thrust into suspended animation for over 75 years and when he awakes it's to a strange new world. Not a bad movie I enjoyed it greatly,Chris Evans proved to me he can carry Captain America's Shield and Hugo Weaving oozes evil as the Red Skull. Tommy Lee Jones gives a strong performance as General Chester Phillips. The movie's biggest strength is the fact that it adheres to old style film making values it felt like watching a old style action film from when they really did know how to make films. Joe Johnston is a old style film maker right up there with John Ford and Howard Hawks and he never seems to get the credit he deserves. With Captain America he makes his best picture yet. The film's moral is believe in yourself believe in your country and never give up. Something we can still believe in today.",10,0,4,13 October 2011
Oblivion," Original and fantastic film making at it's best.
",they say there are no original ideas in movies today. All I have to do is point to Oblivion and say there is. Tom cruise is either getting better at the acting or i'm starting to like him a lot more. Oblivion takes place in the future the moon was destroyed by an alien race that wanted to ravage Earth for our resources. We won the war but lost the Earth. Now Earth is orbited by Man's new home a large space station. And the Earth is inhabited by two people Jack Harper and his partner Victoria. their job is to make sure the Drones put in place to protect the large energy processing plants are running and the plants that are harnessing fission energy for the station are running properly. they have two weeks to go before they can leave this radioactive hulk called the earth.

When Drones start disappearing and Mutant scavengers called scavs are attacking the drones and stealing them and one of the plants is destroyed. Jack is starting to realize things are not what they seem. when a ship crashed and a army of drones kills the survivors except one. Suddenly Jack has more questions then answers when the lone survivor is the woman haunting his memories. And when the Scavs kidnap him and expose him to a startling truth. Jack suddenly realizes he's running out of time. they all are. They all have one chance to escape Oblivion. Can Jack believe his eyes and ears long enough to find out the truth and who can he trust?Well done film a shining example of what Scince fiction should be.,10,3,4,31 August 2013
Man of Steel," You will believe a man can fly.
","Man of Steel. Superman falls under the Nolan treatment by refocusing it's energies on reinventing him. As Nolan did with Batman he introduces Superman to the real world. Or at least as close to the way the real world works. Where Nolan directed Batman with a heavy hand and told a incredible story that spanned three chapters And in which nothing was wasted. Nolan was a perfect choice to tell The best re imaging of Batman for the screen. But Nolan wasn't the best choice for Superman. So they gave that to Zack Snyder a director who has a vision of what action should be. Where Superman returns suffered from a lack of action and a cohesive story. Snyder gives us More story and more action then you can handle and that's a good thing. My Wife who is a casual Superman fan had trouble following it but I'm a die-hard Superman fan and I understood everything. That's the basic thread I can give here. IF you're not a Superman fan and don't follow the story. You might get lost and confused along the way. But that doesn't really detract you from the sheer pleasure of watching this movie. If you are a Superman fan you'll find new twists and tweaks done to the origin that make it work better.FRom the beginning that takes place on Krypton which is as far from Donner's Krypton as possible. You get a sense of wonderment and horror. Russell Crowe is wonderfully cast as Jor-El and he makes you understand the urgency of Krypton's situation. Crowe doesn't fall into the Marlon Brando trap. Where Brando played Jor-El with a underacting air of detachment. Crowe Gives us a Man of passion. A man of action.Kevin Costner gives us a Human Jonathon Kent a man who loves his adopted son and is terrified that the government will come for him or that people will reject him or be in terror of his power. Jon Kent teaches Clark about power about the consequences of misusing that power. The scenes detailing Clark's childhood are full of emotional impact and you get the sense of love mixed with responsibility. Kevin Costner isn't Glenn Ford but he takes the role further and shows us another side to Jonathon Kent. Caught between these two strong but different fathers Clark Kent grows into the type of man he wants to be. A man who wants to help people. A man who will become a symbol of hope and a defender. A Superman.Wonderful re imaging. The Action scenes are strong and realistic.when Superman moves it's with blinding speed, When Superman and Zod hit each other it sounds like Thunder. Nolan introduced the real world into Batman's world. and it works Nolan and Snyder introduced the real world into Superman's world and it works. It takes Superman into a darker place then he's ever been before. And it rewrites everything We knew about Superman. But it works.Henry Cavill is not Christopher Reeve, But before the purists start to argue that Reeve was the best Superman, Let me say Cavill's Superman is not meant to be Reeve's Superman. He is totally different. And He brings a totally new element to Superman. He's a Godlike being trying to be human. he's confused until the moment comes where he knows right or wrong he must make a choice and make a stand for what he believes.Man of Steel gives us a Superman for the 21st century. A Superman we need. A Superman we deserve.",Null,1,3,15 June 2013
Trouble with the Curve," Solid Clint Eastwood film.
","I've been a Clint Eastwood Fan since I first saw him as Dirty Harry in The Enforcer. After that I saw Every Eastwood film I could get my hands on. I was 8 when I saw the Enforcer. just to let you know I've been a Eastwood fan since the mid 70's and I've seen everything he's done. Some great some good some not so good but still entertaining.Trouble with the Curve falls under the good category. Eastwood shows his age flexes his acting muscles and makes a solid hit.The Story follows Legendary Scout for the Atlanta Braves Gus Lobdell. Gus has seen it all knows everything about Baseball and is considered a Legend. Truth is Gus is also seen as a dinosaur. In this Brave New world of Computers and stats and the internet Gus is seen as highly out of touch. He still uses the same methods he used back in the 50's. To Gus it's a game of watching and paperwork and waiting to see what develops. The game has moved on past that. To them computers are the wave of the future to Gus it's the human touch. He feels a computer can't tell you the simple things. Like why a man has a slump when people feel he's finished,all the player needs is to see his family. Or the man has a problem affecting him. Gus can feel that out. A computer can't.So When a rookie player named Bo Gentry comes across the radar for the Braves and the Red Sox Suddenly the push is one to sign Him. The Sox get first pick so it's very important that Gus not screw this up. But Gus is 82 years old and going blind. not to mention he's not very likable. So when his daughter wonderfully played by Amy Adams is asked to help her father and find out what's happening with him. Mickey is understandably upset she's got a big court case coming up with a partnership hanging on the line. and Her estranged father isn't doing so well not to mention he's not talking to her or anyone else about his health woes. Mickey is told that if Gus can't do his job he'll be fired after his contract with the braves expires in three months. So Mickey goes with Gus and meets Johnny a former player turned scout . Johnny is loyal to Gus who had given him his big break. The game isn't important actually it takes the back burner as these three now form the main focus of the film. The Ending is highly unlikely in this day and age. But it feels like that old Hollywood ending full of magic and disbelief. They don't make them like this anymore which is a shame. It's a good solid film that makes for worthwhile entertainment. Here's to Hoping Clint Eastwood makes more films as a actor .",Null,1,2,9 June 2013
We're the Millers," the most fun you'll have at a comedy this year.

IF you are a person who needs to analyze a movie to death and are anal about plot points. don't see this movie. However if your goal is to enjoy yourself and watch a funny movie then this is the one for you. For me this one ranks up there with the original Wayans Scary Movie as the funniest movie I have seen. the basic plot is this. David is a drug dealer he deals pot and he's good at it.

Rocky IV," Rocky 4 Rocky goes to Russia..
",Rocky four is the most political one of the series and that's it's only real down fall. Of course given that it was filmed in the middle of the cold war and Ronald Reagan was President it was only a matter of time. The Story is simple enough. Ivan Drago Russia's most deadliest fighter comes to America to become A Professional and no one wants to take him seriously until Rocky's Best Friend Apollo Creed decides to come out of retirement and take on Drago. Apollo has a long road ahead of him in Convinceing Rocky that what he wants to do is sane. Rocky agrees and trains Apollo and manages him for his comeback. During the fight Apollo is killed because of Drago's incredible strength. Rocky decides to avenge Apollo's Death and goes to Russia to fight Drago. That's it simple enough Rocky fights the bad Russian and wins and tries to convince the Russian people that all American people ain't so bad. I enjoyed it and it was for a long time my favourite in the Series and it stands up well but on the whole I consider it the weak link in the Rocky Series.,10,0,2,23 March 2008

People are worried That Black is going to look for Harry and kill him. THEN things take a twist for the extraordinary as one sub plot meshes with another and another and you end up with the finest entry in the series thus far. Gary oldman is outstanding as Sirius Black a Tragic figure if there ever was one and again the cast pulls together to deliver a fine incredible family movie that is worth watching over and over again. Richard Harris is sorely missed but Michael Dearborn fills Dumbledore's shoes very nicely indeed. One of my all time top favorite movies.,Null,0,0,16 February 2008
The Amazing Spider-Man," Spider-man's secret origin retold.
",The Amazing Spider-Man is very clearly a labour of love. The movie carries with it the same air that the early Stan lee Steve ditko stories did. Spider-Man is a tragic hero. His story has been told and retold. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man felt like a labour of love and it was. But James Webb's seems like it's attribute and a labour of love. He's not in awe of spider-man as Raimi is. Webb writes the movie like a updated version of the character as he was written in the 60's. Peter Parker is a sad sack. He's a nerd and yet he's a smart ass He knows what's right and what's wrong. He makes mistakes and yet he's not afraid to stand up for what's right.Webb's story is familiar and different and remarkably fresh.Peter Parker's parent's are scared of something and leave Peter with his aunt May and Uncle Ben. when the Parker's die in a plane crash Peter is raised by his aunt and uncle. but he has questions. when Peter becomes 16 he finds a briefcase belonging to his dad. inside he finds papers relating to his dad's research into genetic splicing.

Connors uses it to regrow his lost arm only something goes wrong and he becomes the lizard. Peter's budding romance with Gwen takes a strange turn when her father police captain George Stacy decides to arrest the vigilante known as spider-man. meanwhile the lizard launches a attack against mankind which forces captain Stacy and spider-man into a partnership to stop him.The action is crisp and fast. the acting is spot on. the Dark Knight Rises was the better movie of the two. but this one has enough heart to hold it's own against Batman and the Avengers.,10,12,26,9 August 2012
Quantum of Solace," James Bond on a mission of vengeance.
",Quantum of Solace. It isn't your usual Bond film. Which is a good thing. James Bond is on a mission of revenge for the death of Vesper Lynd. Along the way he learns the truth about her. And the truth about himself. Bond is grieving but refuses to acknowledge it. He buries himself in his work. His assignment find out who was behind Vesper's betrayal and the answer is a shadowy organization which they didn't even know existed. Quantom. Quantom is made up of the rich and powerful they're end goal is to control all the resources a country can offer. In this case it's oil. Bond rushes to prevent them from doing that. and in his haste he kills a member of the Prime Minster's secret Service. Hunted and alone Bond must bring Quantum down before they seize they're goal. Not a bad story as far as Bond's go. It's a lot more mature Bond that we're used to seeing. Daniel Craig has stepped up nicely to the position as the Best Bond since Sean Connery. Judi Dench gives a iconic performance as M. IF the future Bond films are made like this or along the same lines it may be said we have a new James Bond for the mature fans. Gone is the quipping every few seconds jumping into bed with every willing female. Here is Bond as Fleming intended and as Connery Created. A Cold Emotionaless Killing machine dedicated to only his duty. And his dedication to M and his status as 007. This is a New JAmes Bond. Better then Jason Bourne by far. And more entertaining by far.,10,1,6,18 August 2012
No Country for Old Men," Don't read anything into it just take it as it is a great story.
",No Country For Old Men is first and foremost a story. It's meant to reflect real life and how things often play out in real life. Bad Things happen to good people and good things happen to bad people like a toss of a coin. The movie opens with a Hunter superbly played by Josh Brolin stumbling upon a drug deal gone bad and discovering a suitcase full of money 2 million dollars to be exact. He takes the money and suddenly everything changes for him from good to bad to terrifying. A killer who wants his money stalks him and no one stands in his way for very long think of the grim reaper with a very bad haircut. and you'll come close to Javier Bardem's KIller. Tommy Lee Jones is as close to excellence as any actor can be in this movie he delivers a old world point of view as a tired sheriff who wants to retire but is suddenly given a case that has too many dead bodies and a man on the run in need of protection and he feels powerless. This role was made for Tommy Lee Jones deadpan delivery and if he said he doesn't have a sense of humor he lied it comes across very subtly in his acting. The Coens's have made a movie as close to an Real Life event as possible. Yes The ending may be unsatisfying for some but to me it made perfect sense. In Real life we do not often get the endings we want just the ones we deserve. But see it and judge it for yourself. A masterful stroke of film-making This one can actually lay claim to being the Citizen Kane of the 21st century. It's flawed and it's story takes you into many other directions until it reaches it's point just like life. Fantastic and chilling and very worth while seeing again and again if only for Tommy Lee Jones and Javier Bardem's masterful performances.,10,2,7,21 March 2008
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Fantasy Lives !
",The Hobbit: The desolation of Smaug. Is pure entertainment from beginning to end. There are fans of the Lords of the Rings and Tolkien's works who are disappointed. When I heard they were taking the Hobbit and making it three films instead of Two. I was disappointed. They're padding it I thought. To stretch it out to make more money. The original story wasn't that long. It could've been covered in two films. I read the Hobbit over a month long period at a breakneck pace. And Loved it. When I saw the First Part of THE HOBBIT. I wasn't disappointed. And again with this part I'm not disappointed. It has all of the ingridents for a fantasy film that Neds to be there. Martin Freeman is strong as Bilbo Baggins. Who we see grow from a meek Hobbit to a strong leader. Bilo proves himself to be more then a master Burgler. He proves to be a heroic warrior. And IAn Mckellion. He is Gandalf. Reprising his role from the Lord of the Rings. Just watching this made me feel like a kid again. I used to read the books under a blanket with a flashlight and read until I fell asleep the book still opened and mad at myself for falling asleep instead of finishing the chapter. There is magic here. True magic. MAgic of the imagination and yes they padded the story but it's a good thing they did. It adds fullness to the story. And it makes it more adventuresome. And Providees Action and More importantly it adds to the story. I loved each and every second of the movie and eagerly await the third part.,10,2,9,30 December 2013
Batman Begins," The Legend of the Batman who he is and how he came to be!
",When I first saw the trailers and read the reviews I was skeptic about this movie. Ra's Al Ghul training Bruce Wayne? amongst other concerns namely Michael Caine playing Alfred. However when I first saw it the movie clicked for me I sat back and watched a Legend Begin. The acting is first rate and the story fit within the accepted origin of Batman.Of course Hollywood being Hollywood they do make changes and they are acceptable changes. They actually add to the movie in small ways. Michael Caine is excellent as Alfred he delivers a strong fatherly performance and Liam Neesan is nothing short of great as Henri Duchard a man with a incredible hidden agenda. Inspired casting Gary Oldman as James Gordon. Christian Bale is now firmly entrenched in my mind as Batman. I hope the Dark Knight is just as good as this one or better.,10,2,2,9 July 2007
Wreck-It Ralph," He's a bad guy who is good. And that ain't bad !

But grows to love her and he finds out Being a real Hero doesn't mean you get a medal,It means doing the right things for the right reasons.The Chrarcters are wonderfully realized. They are fleshed out perfectly. The movie is a uplifting type of film we rarely see. Kids will like it,Because it gives them another kind of story that'll appeal to kids and adults will like it because it will make them feel like a kid again.At least it made me feel like a kid again.",Null,1,1,24 December 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Let me tell you of the days of High Adventure.
",The Hobbit is more then the prequel to the Lord of the Rings series. It is a movie of Derring Do and high adventure. Sword and Sorcery at it's finest. The Story is changed from the book but it adds something to the movie. the Tolkien Hobbit had other elements that served his story well. But they would not translate well onto the screen. Peter Jackson's Adaptation changes aspects that enhance the story. The Story is told from Bilbo's point of view as he writes of his adventures to Frodo. We go from Ian Holm and Eiljah Wood reprising their roles as Bilbo and Frodo in a cameo. Then we go into the story where Young Bilbo is reintroduced to Gandolf and Gandolf decides that Bilbo is too concerned with his own comforts. So he gets Him involved in a adventure for his own good. the Adventure Gandolf gets him involved in involves dwarfs wanting to retake their ancestery home from the dragon that slaughtered their ancestors and King. Now they wander homeless and Kingless going from country to country doing odd jobs and fighting wars for pay. The introduction of this brotherhood to Bilbo is worth the price of the ticket as Bilbo gets culture shock. And finds the courage to go on a adventure something no respectable Hobbit would ever do.The Acting is top notch. A lot of the actors reprise their roles and step into them like it was yesterday. I saw the 3D imax version and that's the best way to get the full scope of the beauty of the film. The Film is a treasure of sight sounds and images and imagination. Grandour on a Epic scale. If you loved Lord of the Rings. You need to see this.,Null,2,7,31 December 2012
Cars," Life is a highway.
",Cars is that little gem of a movie that comes along and seizes your imagination and your heart. cars is about a arrogant race car named Lighting Mcqueen who believes that everything revolves around him until a accident places him under arrest in a forgotten town called Radator springs. It is there where Mcqueen will learn some pretty important life lessons. I took my then 2 year old son to see it in the movie theater and he loved it. The movie captured his attention and didn't let go. Of all the Pixor films that came out he likes this one the best and the toy story series second. I am glad to see Paul Newman portray Doc Hudson/The fabulous 50's Hornet he gives a wonderful performance as a older statesman of the acting school this is a fine role for him and one that he should include in his resume as it is one of the strong points of Cars.,10,0,1,3 March 2008
Cars 2," Mater...Tow Mater. Tow truck by day, Secret Agent by night.
",Cars 2 is not what I expected. It was better then I expected back in 2006 when CARS made it's debut it was aimed at younger children like my son who was 2 years old when he saw it in the theatre and it captured his attention. Now my don id 7 years old and his youngest brother is 2 years old and we took them to see CARS 2. They LOVED IT. Cars 2 is not made for adults it is made for kids pure and simple but Cars 2 grew up with it's audience. the theme is the same it is about friendship and being there for your friends and This time it is also about not being afraid to be yourself. The Story is not complicated which is good because it is a kids movie after all and those should never be too complicated. There is more action in this one then the first one and maybe a better story in this one then the first. The only drawback is no Paul Newman who sadly died before he could take his part as Doc Hudson . But We did Get Michael Caine as Finn Mcmissile a secret agent in the James Bond mold. The magic continues. See it and make your mind up for yourself Pixar didn't stumble when they made this flick. They grew up and brought more of the magic with them for us to enjoy.,10,8,15,25 June 2011
Gran Torino," What does everyone want with my car?
",Gran Torino is one of Clint Eastwood's greatest achievements in film. And this coming from a man who created some of film's Greatest heroes or antiheroes Josey Wales Dirty Harry The man with no name and many others. This film continues the trend Eastwood began with the Flag of our Fathers and continued with Letters from Iwo Jima. Humanizing the after effects of the trauma of war. Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski a bitter Korea War vet he's not happy with the way his life has gone he's not happy with the past and he's certainly not happy with the present and the future the way it's shaping out to be. His wife has died and his neighborhood has gone to the Asians in fact his neighbors are a family of Hmong who are having problems of their own. their world's collide when the oldest boy is pressured by his cousin to join his gang his initiation steal Walt's prized 1972 Gran Torino. When Walt stop's the car theft and saves the boy from the gang their world's become intertwined. Walt the loner does not want anything to do with them but slowly he gets drawn in and soon he cares deeply about the boy Thao almost as much as a father cares for a son. Comedy and tragedy mix in equal combinations to create one of the most stunning finishes I have ever seen in any movie that even now still lingers even after the movie has been long over. This is not a movie for the sensitive nor the political correct. But rather a movie for everyone caught up in a future they never could've seen coming and anyone caught in a culture clash they can't understand but Eastwood does and this is his statement and it is a powerful one. They Say Gran Torino is Eastwood's last time acting well if so he left on a grand high note.,10,1,6,20 July 2009
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," With Great power comes great responsibility.
",Marc Webb rewrote Spider-man with his last movie. And he got so many things right. With the Amazing Spider-man II Webb continues to reinvent Spider-man. His take on Spider-man is a mature one. And one that follows the potential that Spider-man always had. He was created to be the hero who could be you. Spider-man was created to showcase a super hero who was not rich or had the powers of a god . Instead he had the powers of a Spider. And the maturity to realize that he had the power to change lives for the better after tragic cicrcumstances forced him to realize he had to Help those in need and to protect the helpless and fight evil and stop crime. Even though the cost to him at times is high. and That PEter PArker's life can become a chaotic mess. He never fails to be the hero he has to be. That's the difference between Nolan's Dark Knight Movies and Webb's Spider-man films. Webb can explore the darker issues of being a superhero but he keeps it fun.. Andrew Garfield is simply perfect as Peter Parker. When the Amazing Spider-man was first released I was a strong Toby fan. I wanted to hate Andrew but couldn't. He brought the hero to life with his quips. And his actions. Where Raimi was quick to imply the cost of being a hero. But rarely showed it. Webbb Shows us in every heart breaking detail. Where Raimi shyed away from certain details. Webb Shows us. And Because he shows us he Adds a more rounded dimension to Spider-man. The only beef I do have is omission of scenes that were shown in the trailer. but not in the movie. There literally is more then enough story for two movies and there is a major set up for Amazing Spider -man III. This movie is a comic book come to life. Webb and company do their best to transform the world of the comic book into the real world and it works. Webb proves that not all Super hero films need to be dark and full of angry avenging figures. sometimes they can be colourful figures that simply enjoy being who they are and the enjoy it to the fullest. the only advice I can give is sit back grab your popcorn and your drink. And watch the movie and to be prepared to be amazed.,Null,0,2,20 May 2014
Patton," The Legend of General George S .Patton.
",Patton is one of those war movies that grabs your attention and holds it.The Real life story of Patton was more complex then this movie could ever have been.Instead it takes the real life story of PAtton and combines it with the LEGEND of old blood and guts. Patton was almost the same in this movie as he was in life but in life he was much much larger and more colorful He inspired his men.At the time of the slapping incidents which is portrayed here almost as it happened Patton was the most popular General The Allies had. second only after Eisenhower and Bradley was third overall. This movie shows the problems that Eisenhower had with Patton he was really the only general who was feared by the Germans his leadership inspired the men to fight and he got great Press. But he was too much of a rebel and how do you deal with a rebel and punish him when he is your best general? George C. Scott was outstanding in his portrayal of Patton and he deserved his Oscar for this role and Scott did a Incredible Patton like thing in refusing the Oscar and adding to the glamour of the movie. And of course we have Karl Malden as Omar Bradley one of his best roles and most likely his most overlooked role which is a shame because he ADDS to the complex colorful story of PATTON. Everyone here carries off their role perfectly and the research alone is nothing short of brilliance this movie is one of the greatest movies made in my mind. More entertaining then the bio pic of MACARTHUR with the always brilliant Gregory Peck that movie although fun and entertaining fell short of the glory and glamour that was PATTON. Now I've always hoped and prayed the they could make a movie on Ike Eisenhower on the same scope and same care they showed in making Patton. Highly recommended this is not your typical war movie. A incredible event.,10,1,4,24 July 2007
Grudge Match," Rocky Balboa VS Jake Lamotta or Razor VS Kid.
",Grudge match isa fun movie. It pokes fun at Stallone's most iconic role and at Deniro's Jake La Motta. Henry 'RAZOR' Sharp is a talented tough Pittsburgh Boxer who has a rival in Kid MCdonnal. Both are talented and tough where Razor is humble Kid is loud. Where Both were at one time the Light heavyweight Champion of the world. Kid lets that define him Razor does not. When the first fight between them is hailed as a classic and the second fight breaks records and the fans demanding a third one. Razor walks away from billions back in 1984. the Why is a mystery. and the greatest rematch is only a fantasy. flash forward to 2012. Kid is a successful businessman owning a bar and a auto dealership and playing off of his boxing image. Razor is a welder at the dockyards and has been for the last thirty years. Both men are content. razor looks after his old trainer lighting played by Alan Arkin who steals the movie. When Razor and Kid's history is brought up on a sports show. the son of Razor's late manager comes to Razor with a offer film a video game with Kid. Needing the money he agrees to do it for 15 thousand. and when he meets Kid again their hatred for each other literally turns into a brawl that gets the world's attention. And the idea for the Grudge match is born. While training for it. Both men encounter secrets from their past. lost loves and most importantly grudging respect for one another. Stallone and Deniro play this one off wonderfully against one another. Stallone is the straight man and gets the best lines. Deniro is the comedic one and gets the best scenes. And Arkin steals the movie from under them. Grudge match is a good time at the movies . It's not what many people think it is. And because of that it's better then what people think it is.,Null,3,4,25 August 2014
Men in Black II," Men In Black II Welcome back Mr. Jones Mr. Smith we missed you.
",Men In Black ended with Agent Jay mind wiping Agent Kay so that he can live a happy life or so we think. Men In Black II opens up with Jay chasing down an alien that lives in the NYC subway system and is a threat to the city. Jay has in time become one of their best agents but he has a habit of mind wiping his partners because they don't want to be MIB agents anymore so he's kind of tainted in that respect. During all of this an alien named Serleena arrives on Earth Serleena is played to the hilt by Laura Flynn Boyle and she hams it up nicely her sidekick played by Johnny Knoxville could use a little bit of work but he does OK. Serleena arrives and takes over MIB HQ it seems she's looking for a object of great power that KAy hid long ago under the protection of a guardian. Jay Escapes and he realizes MIB's only chance is to bring Kay back to the fold restore his memories and defeat Serleena. When Tommy Lee Jones makes his appearance the movie picks up considerably and it's very nicely understood that while Smith is the maniacal energy and the comedic relief Tommy Lee Jone simply is the heart of Men In Black while Rip Torn as Zed is the Soul. Without these three actors Men In BLack would not be as good there is something about the dynamic here that the three bring to the table. My only complaint as with the first was that it was too short Sonnifeld is a gifted directer and Knows how to make great movies with the MIB series he really should think about lengthen the running time so the movie does not feel as rushed and we can enjoy it as it unfolds.,10,6,10,23 December 2009
Lincoln," This is History gentlemen.
",LINCOLN is a masterpiece. People will praise Daniel Day Lewis and they quite rightfully should. His portrayal of Abe Lincoln is quite astonishing. He gets into the DNA of Lincoln and he doesn't come across as a cardboard cutout either. There is a overall flaw in human nature to portray historical figures as great. Without bothering to realize they are human. When it is Their Very Humanity that made them great. Lincoln fought the civil War and he suffered greatly thru out the war. He suffered as the country suffered. Here in this film you feel Lincoln's despair and his anguish at trying to end a war. And to free slaves and abolish slavery from America forever. But he faced fierce objections to his 13th admenment . This film focuses strongly on Lincoln's last few months alive as he struggles to create peace. and to free slaves and make them part of the human race. Sally Field not really my favourite actress shines as the tragic Mary Todd Lincoln. Lincoln's wife has always been regarded as Lincoln's crazy wife. And yet here she shines as Lincoln's strongest supporter as well as his wife. there are some very tender moments as Lincoln plays with his youngest son These scenes are the ones that got my attention. Simply because You never view Lincoln as a father to the world or to history he was a president. But he was a father. And this film shows his relationship with his oldest Robert and his youngest son Tad. And it shows his struggles to be both a loving father and a father who wants to do what is right by his sons. Now Tommy Lee Jones simply sparkles like a diamond. Tommy Lee Jones is one of the world's greatest actors and here he shows it. His Thaddeous Stevens comes across As a conflicted fighter for equal rights. All he wants i to make blacks equal under the law to make them free men. and he has a very personal reason to. But in the end all he has to settle for is simply the first step and that is abolishing slavery forever. I viewed this film as a snapshot of historical value because it reminds us it wasn't easy to get from there to here .That one man's honest struggle with himself and his desire to right a wrong overcame so much. Spielberg should have won the Oscar for this film. He made it seem like we were there. And for people who wanted Lincoln's childhood told well that has been told. This film focuses on more then just Lincoln. It focuses on the times and the people who made it. Incredible film. It's not a action film because it's not meant to be one. You want a action film featuring Abe Lincoln go see Abe Lincoln vampire hunter. This one is about the Real Lincoln and it's so much more enjoyable.,10,1,2,16 October 2013
Big Hero 6," Big Hero 6 = big action and great family fun !
",Big Hero 5 is simply a great time at the movies. The Message is clear. We can all be heroes. The story is somewhat cliché when Hiro's Brother Toshida is killed in a lab explosion. and Hiro's tech is stolen. he discovers his brother was left to die by the villain. Hiro uses his brother's invention a medical inflatable robot Beymax Who provides some of the movie's greatest moments. and with the help of his brother's friends and lab partner's they go after the villain. Along the way Hiro learns to never confuse Justice with Revenge and learns with the help of his friends into learning how to become a real Hero My kids loved it. The movie was full of comedic moments and some sad moments that truly wrench at the heart. But the more important aspect here is the life lessons you learn along the way. You don't need a inflatable robot or powers to be a hero. You can find that power inside you. The movie was wonderfully done the animation was perfect and flawless. The Story was a good strong one and solid. Will there be a Big Hero 6 II I hope so if they can make it as good as they made this one.,10,5,26,11 November 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," We're the Guardians of the Galaxy.
",When I was a kid. My very first exposure to the Guardians of the Galaxy comic came by way of the Avengers. There was Vance Astro a future astronaut who idolized Captain America and carried his shield into battle. Yondu Charlie 27 Starhawk and others who I forget. they were banded together by Vance Astro who was inspired by the exploits of the Avengers and he decided that the Galaxy needed a Avengerslike team. They were from the 31st century. and granted things change and the Line up of the Gaurdians of the Galazy changed. A few years back The powers at Marvel decided to bring the band back together with some of Marvel's old and forgotten Sci-fi heroes. they brought back Peter Quill A.K.A. Star-Lord to lead this band. They brought back Rocket Raccoon and a old d-list villain called Groot. then there was Gamora the daughter of Thanos the death dealer. Drax the Destroyer a living engine of war. These Guardians had a fairly long run for a sci-fi comic consisting of forgotten heroes. When Marvel annoucned they were bring the Guardian to the big screen I was convinced it wasn't going to work. Too obscure too far reaching of a concept. I heard reports of the making of it. and it sounded interesting. I was going to see it anyways . I've seen every Marvel film in the theatre. My kids are starting to watch them with me. As a whole the entire family enjoys them. but still I was convinced that Marvel had a bomb. The previews were cute and everything looked great. Then my ten year old son. Started asking questions about the Guardians of the Galaxy. He wanted to see it. And I started to rethink my opinion. that it was a dud. Because suddenly looking at it from a child's eyes this was like Star Wars all over again. There was action and suspense and romance. And they tie it together all in a pretty bow. The story is this. In 1988 young Peter Quill loses his mother. He's never known his father and his mother insists his father was not from this world. His father she insists was a being of pure light. She dies and Peter runs away from the hospital where he is taken by a alien ship. 26 years later Peter Quill is a intergalactic thief and pirate who is a womanizer from one end of the galaxy to the other. Quill calls himself Star-Lord and he tries to act like he is more of a bigger deal then he is. When Star-Lord is hired to retrieve a orb from an abandoned planet he sets into motion a series of events. That lead from an unholy alliance between Thanos and Ronan the Accuser a galactic butcher from the Kree race. they want that orb and so does Quill's former team mates the ravagers a band of pirates headed up by Yondu a merc. With a heart of larceny. When Quill eludes both Ronan's Agents and the ravagers Yondu places a price on his head. Quill heads to Xandar the home of the Nova corps which is currently at war with ronan. Quill wants to sell the orb to a dealer. While he tries to sell it he is spotted by two bounty hunters A Raccoon named Rocket and a treelike creature named Groot. Rocket sees that Quill has a bounty on his head of forty thousand units. He thinks he'll be rich. Until he confronts Quill who is attacked by Thanos daughter Gamora. Gamora is willing to betray her father to save Xandar. Star-Lord Rocket Raccoon and Groot get into a fight with Gamora which bring the authorities. they are taken to the Kiln a galactic prison where they meet Drax a walking time bomb. Drax wants to kill Gamora because Ronan killed his wife and daughter. and he is convinced killing Thanos daughter would bring him peace. Gamora reveals to them that she has a buyer for the orb. And he is willing to pay forty million units for it. Rocket and Quill do the math and figure it out they'll be rich. Rocket comes up with a plan to break out. This break out scene is easily one of the film's highlights. after they escape they bring the orb to the Collector. A mad immortal who collects one of every thing that is unique. He reveals the weapon to be a soul gem. A Gem of such vast power you can destroy galaxies with it. Star-Lord discovers he can't let this thing fall into Thanos hands or Ronan's hands. And so begins a quest to save the galaxy from those who would destroy it. The climatic battle is beautifully rendered. And you see the Gaurdians begin to come together as a team. They trust each other. Because of what they've been thru already. By the time the film ends they are no longer a team they are a family. And they are more then ready to assume their new responsibilities as the Guardians of the Galaxy. Now you don't need to be a comics geek to watch this and enjoy it. Nor do you have to be a huge sci-fi fan either.,10,1,3,11 August 2014
From Dusk Till Dawn," Everybody be cool YOU be cool.
","From Dusk till Dawn is that rare movie these days it's a movie willing to take a chance and to try to be what it is a pure escapist film one that tells you at the first scene to shut your brain off you'll enjoy it better that way. People who analyze it too much won't be able to enjoy it for what it is a fun story that has a quick twist in the middle and it is there where the real story begins. In the beginning we meet Seth And Ritchie Gecko two outlaw brothers trying to escape the law and head towards Mexico. It's complicated by Ritchie's poor judgment skills and the fact that he is delusional and that gets them both into trouble. Did I mention that Ritchie is a murdering Sex fiend with no sense of being Subtle whatsoever. Ritchie's idea of solving a problem is by killing who ever he's arguing with at the time. Seth is a master of conversation he would talk his way out of trouble but push him and he'll kill you stone cold dead. The First half is a crime film in which Seth And Ritchie take the Fuller family hostage Ala The desperate hours. They Use the Fuller RV to get into Mexico and wait at the Titty Twister a bar catering to bikers and truckers. Seth And Ritchie are waiting for Carlos a Mexican Crime lord who offers Seth And Ritchie safe Haven in El Rey for thirty percent of their loot. Once we enter the titty twister the movie changes Gear and steps up the pace it becomes a horror film complete with vampires. And a Standoff worthy of Howard Hawks. I wonder what Hawks would've done with this script and I tell myself he would've done it the same way. The Action is hot the Dialogue sharp and witty and the characterizations of the main characters is on target. This is by no means a academy award winning film but it has everything a serious film lover wants, Good direction A fast Pace A Good solid story And Superb acting from it's cast. Harvey Keital is solid and dependable as always as the minister Jacob Fuller fated to become a Fearless Vampire killer. And Quentin Tarentino is a good strong comedic actor turning a vile character like Ritchie into a almost likable person. George Clooney delivers the performance of a life time as Seth Gecko in a role that's got to be remembered as one of his best. If You don't believe me watch for yourself You are in for a special Treat.",Null,0,1,15 July 2008

The courage Rae exhibits in trying to change persuades Laz to pick up the guitar and become a bluesman again. This movie Shows that not only is redemption possible even for the worst of us IT'S Needed by us to move on to for us to live our lives. Sam Jackson displays great courage in doing this role and brings to it a strong and incredible conviction. Plus hearing and seeing Jackson playing the blues is alone enough for me to say this movie is worthy of ten stars. an outstanding movie made with an outstanding cast with an unflinching story that pulls no punches. Go see it.,Null,3,5,26 September 2008
The Dark Knight," The Dark Knight Returns.
","Batman Begins was a exciting start. It Showed us how the Batman is meant to be and how he should be treated on the movie screen. The Dark Knight takes that movie one step further. And in doing so gives us perhaps the most realistic portrayal of The Batman and The Joker EVER! The Late Heath Ledger gave easily the performance of a lifetime with some actors you can see where the role ends and they begin or vice versa. But not here. Ledger immersed himself so completely into the Role of the Joker it's as if he was channeling the Criminal's personality, Chilling is the word I use for Heath Ledger he does not stop he continues until the very end of the movie giving a 100 percent a brilliant portrayal from a extremely talented actor. Christian Bale moves on and not only BETTERS his performance from the first Batman he adds layers to Bruce Wayne and Batman he shows us just how crazy it must be to be Batman and still have people you love and walk that tightrope in trying to protect them. Or protecting his city. Batman makes a New Ally alongside James Gordon and that is the crusading fearless D.A. Harvey Dent. Aaron Eckhart gives a strong performance but he is a little weak considering just who he's playing against. But Eckhardt compensates for his weaknesses but underplaying his role at times and then overplaying it keeping us on the edge of our seat making his Harvey Dent dangerous and unpredictable. Gary Oldman gives us a strong James Gordon who wants to play with the rules and the Gordon who envies Batman's freedom in doing what needs to be done. This then is how it's SUPPOSE to be done in as Grand a style and action that's so EPIC you sit in awe of the stunts and effects. And The WAy it needs to be The Batman VS The Joker on the greatest battlefield of all GOTHAM CITY. This is the film that should go down as the greatest Comic book adaptation and all the new ones should watch and learn from it. Well Worth seeing.",Null,4,8,3 August 2008

Men in Black," Men In Black one of the best examples of how to make a perfect movie.
",Men In Black is the citizen Kane of the Sci-Fi world and maybe one of the best examples of how to make a movie. The Story is simple There is a Agency which does not exist called MIB (Men In Black) They monitor any and all alien activity on Earth. The movie starts off with two MIB agents stopping an illegal alien from coming into the USA when the alien gets a little angry Agent Jay has to kill him. His partner feeling he's too old for this retires and Jay begins to look for a new partner which happens to be Police Detective James Darrell Edwards. Will Smith delivers the movie's maniacal energy whereas Tommy Lee Jones gives a remarkable deadpan performance that drives the movie forward. Without Mister Jones and Mister Smith it's safe to say There would not be a movie. Anyways back to the story. When Agent K played by MR.Jones trains the rookie agent J played by MR.Smith a intergalactic situation occurs. the Prince of a planet who hid out on earth is assassinated by a Bug the Prince's planet demands the return of a galaxy or earth will be destroyed and MIB is held responsible. MIB sends J and K down to retrieve the galaxy and stop the bug from escaping with the galaxy. The climax mixes horror comedy and suspense beautifully. My only complaint is the running time is too short I could have easily enjoyed another hour of Men In Black.,10,0,0,20 December 2009
The World's Fastest Indian," Nothing can stop the power of a dream if it's strong enough.
","The world's fastest Indian is simple enough to sum up never give up on your dreams. Even if there is road blocks put in your path. Anthony Hopkins delivers perhaps one of his best acting roles in years and he shows his amazing talent in portraying Burt Munro a man with a dream and a vision to match. His dream is to race his 1924 Harley Davidson Indian motorcycle at the Bonneville salt flats or as he puts it it's sacred ground, hallow ground. Perhaps no one understands this better then Roger Donaldson who also had a dream and a vision in bringing Munro's story to the screen and in doing so brought to life one of the most inspiration movies I have ever seen. The talent behind this movie was white hot and it hit each and every button they were aiming for. Was it worth watching Yes. Will this movie stay with you long after you see it yes. This movie is as the tagline states is based on one hell of a story and it is true. Burt Munro should be remembered thanks to this movie and the amazing job done by Anthony Hopkins.",10,2,2,6 January 2008
Avatar," us VS them
",James Cameron's Avatar is a breathtaking film of the first order. It's also a old theme us vs. them cowboy's vs Indians superheroes vs supervillians and so forth. However the story is set in the far future where we discover the planet Pandora. The inhabitants of Pandora are all one they're all connected with the planet the wildlife and each other their beliefs are that each are connected by one spirit one source of energy that binds them all. The respect they have for the planet is pure love. Enter the Human race Earth is dying our resources are dead or dying the planet must find newer resources to survive and as it just so happens Pandora has a lot of rare Minerals and resources that can allow us new sources of energy. But there is one problem the planet is toxic to us the air is deadly . SO enter the Avatar program. After generations of observing them and studying them they have created a Hybrid that can survive on the planet it is called a Avatar. It looks like the aliens it moves like the aliens but it is inhabited by a human conscience. Time is running out the corporations that now run the earth and the armed forces want these minerals and resources but the inhabitants don't want to deal they seem to us simplistic and naive. So enter Jake Scully a former Marine now paralyzed from the waist down injured in the line of duty.All Scully wants at first is to serve to be useful. Scully's brother was one of the men behind the success of the Avatar program but died in a senseless mugging before he could inhabit his Avatar. Jake's DNA is a match for his brother's Hybrid and Jake is given a mission find out all you can about them get them to trust you get them to give us what we want. and maybe when this is over we'll get you an operation to get your legs back. Faced with a incredible chance to get his legs back Jake becomes an Avatar. He goes in with a sense of wonder the planet is fantastic but he is alway reminded of what his mission is. Jake makes contact with the people as they call themselves they know he is one of them in a hybrid form but Jake convinces them that his misson is to learn all he can about Pandora. And he learns and as he learns he falls in love first with the woman instructed to teach him and then with the planet the people and their ways. At first Jake tries to convince them to deal with the humans but with time running out Jake begins to see just who is evil and who isn't and he tries to warn them that something horrible is about to happen. With only a few human scientists and a handful of other avatars Jake tries to rally the people only to find it's a matter of too little too late and Jake realizes the truth we are the invaders and Jake now must make a choice that will change everything he knows and everything he loves. James Cameron's Story telling abilities are at his best here. He creates a new world with a new people and new ways that seem at once alien and comforting to us the audience. While he finds a new way to present the human race is a way that's both familiar and horrifying Cameron pulls no punches here. James Cameron simply gives a simple story that is complex upon studying it. This is maybe his best movie of his career.,10,2,6,27 March 2010
The Hurricane," Rubin Hurricane Carter a innocent man trapped in a living hell.. Here Comes the story of the Hurricane.
",Rubin Carter was once one of the most highly feared middleweights of the sixties. he had a strong punch and a taste for the finer things in life. He also had a attitude towards white society that made Malcolm X look calm. Carter had also spent more then half of his life behind prison bars. In June of 1966 four people where murdered in a Paterson New Jersey bar and Rubin Carter and his Friend John Artis were arrested for the crime despite the only evidence being circumstantial and that the police detective in charge of the case knew Rubin and hated him. Rubin and John Artis were sentenced for three life sentences to be served in prison. Rubin Carter served the first ten years angry and he wrote a book called the 16th round. Rubin and Artis did get a second trial but that too found him guilty. Rubin Carter never stopped fighting it wasn't enough to be free but he wanted his name cleared. Enter Lesra Martin a black youth living in a commune with a group of well meaning white Canadians who want to make the world a better place They're rich resourceful and full of a never stop never give up attitude. When Lesra reads a battered copy of the 16th round and finds Rubin still in jail. The Canandians vow to fight for Rubin and never stop Lesra and his friends along with Rubin's lawyers find enough evidence to Get Rubin Carter free after spending 22 years in prison for a crime that he never did. Norman Jewison is an old hand at this type of film a lot of people who were angry at Rubin Carter claimed that The HURRICANE was a attempt to make Rubin a saint. They took shots at the things that happened but were never portrayed or the way things were done. Jewison himself said that if he included everything that happened to Rubin during the 22 years he spent in jail you would be watching a much longer film longer by about a year. The film makers took liberties but still stand within the fact and they served Rubin better then any lie. Denzal Washington simply is the movie he makes the film sizzle and that is a glowing tribute to an extraordinary man Rubin Hurricane Carter.,10,2,4,28 February 2010
Rocky," Rocky goes the distance and stands the test of time.
",Rocky the movie is a legend and it launched the career of it's principal actors especially Stallone. But more then that this movie created a genre that is still widely imitated to this day. Rocky is about a aging fighter from a slum neighborhood he works for a local loan shark as a enforcer but Rocky's too good natured for that line of work and when he can he fights. Also Rocky is in love with adrian his best friends sister she's shy but she also likes Rocky. Life is not great for Rocky but he's Happy enough comfortable is more like it. Then things change in the form of Apollo Creed The Heavyweight Champion of the world he needs a fighter to fight for a big bi centennial match and chooses Rocky based on his nickname the Italion Stallion. From there Rocky's life Changes and the people around him change as well. Does He win the Big Fight? Does he get the Girl? None of that's really important the journey itself is the important part here the Championship fight is only the icing on a very wonderful cake. I have seen this movie so many times I've memorized the lines and the scenes I can speak the lines before the actors do(It really annoys my Wife) But This movie is one of my important films of my life it's stayed with me from 1976 til now and it has not diminished in it's importence to me or other fans. A film Stallone must be proud of.,10,0,0,23 March 2008
Jack Reacher," Avenger
",Jack Reacher is simply put a great action picture. You love the books you'll love this movie. If you're hung up on the way the character is supposed to be in the books. Well then you'll have a harder time enjoying it. Lee Child's description of Reacher is a tad unrealistic. tom Cruise brings a realistic take on Reacher.

This film is such a pleasure to watch because it avoids all of the old tired clichés.,10,2,4,10 November 2013
Titanic," they said God himself couldn't sink her.
",James Cameron's masterpiece a movie that has Almost everything in it love romance Heroism and sacrifice and unbridled Evil. And the best part most of it is true. Cameron's Titanic is a fictional story told from the most part between two tragic lovers Rose Dewitt and Jack Dawson. Winslet and Decaprio deliver career making performances here. I had been impressed with Decaprio from What's eating Gilbert Grape and discovered this young man can act He stole a movie from Johnny Depp not a easy thing to do. But anyways. Rose is going to be forced into a loveless marriage to a heartless millionaire wonderfully played in a sleazy manner by Billy Zane. Rose's Mother was once married to a man who was once Rich but spent all the money and Died on them leaving them only a name some social connections and a mountain of debt. So Rose must marry a detestable man for his money. In fact once they reach America they will be married. Jack Dawson is a drifter and a dreamer who goes where the wind blows him and the wind gives him a ticket to the third class passenger section of Titanic. Jack is a artist who cares for the adventure of life. Things happen when he rescues Rose from a suicide attempt and she introduces him to her world and discovers they will not make a place for Jack in their world he is beneath them. Jack introduces her to his world and she discovers people who are dirt poor but Rich in other ways They are so alive and vibrant and she discovers within herself the strength to move beyond matters of wealth and social standing. However Rose's Mother and her groom to be have discovered that Rose has fallen for Jack and all their planning in now in danger. Then comes the unthinkable the Titanic hits an iceberg and begins to flood. The Captain is given the dire news in an hour all of this will be at the bottom of the Atlantic. the news is met with horror skeptics scoff at the idea of the unsinkable Titanic sinking and the people are now drawn into battles of classes first class passengers first all others after. Jack and Rose struggle to survive the death of Titanic and to try to find some meaning after the ship has died and gone down to the bottom of the ocean. There is a beginning story that frames the entire movie involving men and women diving on Titanic looking for treasure and getting involved with old Rose who tells the story. But the Real story here is Cameron's dedication to detail he spent fives years diving on the Titanic and interviewing survivors his quest for accuracy was an obsession that paid off Big. I took my wife to see this movie back when it had just been released and I groaned thru the romance and I laughed at the end when Dicaprio's Heroic Jack Dawson makes a big sacrifice in fact my wife called me a caveman with no feelings. However 13 years later I saw the film on TV again and watched it from the beginning and I Caught all of it. And I understood it better now that all the hype has died down and the Cult of Decaprio has quietly gone away that this movie is a human tragedy and that love knows no boundaries and that somethings should always be remembered no matter how painful. James Cameron created a masterpiece and maybe the movie by which he will always be remembered.,10,1,2,24 February 2010

The Public doesn't care to them Rocky is a hero. When rocky meets Lang he loses Everything The Heavy Weight Championship and Mickey. His life spirals into a downward spin until a friend from the past offers to help him out once again Enter Apollo Creed. Rocky 3 Was the best in the series and to many it still is the fact that Stallone finds ways to put Rocky into hardships is inventive and let's Face it Rocky 3 is the sleekest and the most attractive looking of the series it mirrors Rocky's life.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," The boy who lived. a tale of Harry Potter
",I saw this movie first before reading the books and walked away very impressed. The sheer imagination that came with this movie amazed me the story is wonderfully written a kids movie that does not dumb itself down to it's audience. Daniel Radcliffe's acting is a little stiff a little wooden but not overly all considering the fact that he was not a acting expert when he started he manages to do very well. Richard Harris THE man who was born to be Dumbledore I can't imagine anyone else in this role even his eventual replacement in the prisoner of azkaban does not measure up to him. And Robbie Coltrane the heart of the series his Hagrid is a joy to watch as is Emma Watson who is outstanding as Herimone Granger. This movie is a treat and deserves to be watched again and again and in years to come I'm sure it'll be labeled a Classic.,10,0,1,16 February 2008
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The Changing point for Harry Potter nothing stays the same.
",One of the things most people grasp about the Harry Potter series is this. It grows up with it's readers it doesn't dumb itself down to it's audience it assumes that if you're there watching it then you must know everything you need to and it starts off at a breakneck speed not breaking once. There is a nice subplot involving Harry And Ron finding young love for the first time and there is the Danger of the Triwizard Tournment in Which Harry has been entered without his consent. The movie delivers on all points and Again Michael Gambon fills The LAte Richard Harris's Shoes as Dumbledore in this his second movie Gambon Owns the role and performs outstandingly. This is the movie that sets up the rest of the Harry Potter adventures in order to understand them you must see Goblet of Fire watch it and be amazed.,Null,0,0,16 February 2008
Thor," Thor: Call down the Thunder.
",When I first heard that Thor was being made with Chris Hemsworth as Thor. I didn't give it much hope. Then I heard Ken Brangh was directing and I said Oh I might check this out after all. and I am Glad I did. It's a solid movie. With a solid cast. Hemsworth comes across as the Arrogant Thor who needs to learn a lesson. Sir Anthony Hopkins steals the show as The all powerful Odin. Natalie Prtman steals hearts as JAne Foster and Tom Huddleson ? It's his movie to lose. His Loki gives us the most compelling bad guy with a personality. He has a reason to feel the anger he does and the hate. While Odin selects Thor to take his place as King of Asgard Loki uncovers a secret that nearly destroys everything. He is not Odin's son. he is in fact the son of the frost giant King. And Loki was taken from a battlefield and raised to be Odin's son. The God of Mischiefwants the throne of Asgard for himself. So he sets a plot in motion to send Thor into Exile and to remove Odin out of his way. Along the way Thor learns his lessons. And Loki decides to take the fight to Earth to get rid of his half brother once and for all. While Thor the Dark World is better in some ways. THOR has the better characterization. It brings Thor very nicely into the MArvel U and helps set up the Avengers in a very nice and very good way. Some claim it's the weakest MArvel movie. Others think it's a insult to the Mrvel U. I tend to think of it as one of the cornerstones of the cinematic Marvel U. Because Without Thor. There would be no Avengers. While not the best marvel movie. It certainly is one of the more watchable ones.,Null,0,1,27 July 2014
Zombieland," what if you were one of the last survivors of a Zombie Armageddon?
",Zombieland attempts to answer that question. the time is now the Zombie takeover began when a customer ate a tainted hamburger at a truck stop the burger had a new stain of Mad cow disease instead of killing him it made him into a cannibalistic Zombie with anger issues. Everyone he bites transforms into killer zombies those who don't survive become Food. Simple plot into this chaos comes Columbus and Tallahassee two survivors who team up with the understanding that once they reach their destination they will go their own way. However they like each others company and they know that being together increases their chances of survival. then they meet two sisters Little Rock and Wichita who are con artists and take the boys for a ride every chance they get. They too realize that the strength in numbers will work for them survival wise. Woody Harrelson's Tallahassee is a Zombie hating Twinkle addicted Gunfighter who turns Zombie killing into an art form. He makes the movie it is his movie hands down. The rest of the cast compliment him wonderfully they add to his strengths and add to the fun of the film. It's a fun shut off your brain don't question it or take it too seriously movie. I hear Zombieland 2 is being considered and I hope so because this is the beginning of a beautiful franchise.,10,1,2,15 October 2009
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts and finds a mystery and his life in danger
",Harry Potter's 2nd adventure is just as enthralling as his first. It begins with Harry being warned against going back to Hogwarts and picks up great speed from there. The acting has improved and you can see the group dynamic that Rowling put into place with the first story finally clicking on all eights in this one. Daniel Radcliffe breathes life into Harry and he brings to life all of Harry's emotions showing us that Harry's life is not as wonderful as we might think it is. We also get a glimpse into the life of Hagrid before harry was Born and we also meet for the first time Tom Marvelo Riddle a man who hates Harry beyond all reason. This one has it all life love laughter action and adventure and a bit of comedy tossed in all mix well and come together to create a very worthy entry into the world of Harry Potter.,Null,0,2,16 February 2008

",Man On Fire is one of my personal favourites. The story is simple. Creasy is a former soldier of fortune who is burnt out and tired of life. a alcholic Creasy is looking for two things either to find a reason to live. Or a reason to kill himself and that end might come sooner then later. Creasy visits his best friend a former soldier named Rayburn who is rich and well connected in Mexico.

The Green Mile," Miracles can happen in the most unexpected places.
","I read The book in serial form when it came out and quickly re read it when it was released as a novel.It was Stephen King's finest work to date I thought and I believed he'd have topped it by now.However King to my knowledge has not and the movie version of the Green Mile shows it's author's love as well as Frank Darabont's love for the time period and in helping re create king's Characters and in helping Redefine them Darabont makes a true masterpiece out of the Green Mile you can't but help but watch and feel what the main characters feel.Tom Hanks shows us once again what a great actor he is.In my mind Hanks is this generations James Stewart he can be very good and he can at times underplay a scene just to let the others shine. But as good as Tom Hanks is the kudos for this movie must rightfully go to Michael Clarke Duncan his performance as John Coffey is wonderfully played and Duncan MAKES Coffy's innocence shine thru this man has all the making's to become one of the 21st century's greatest Actors if he is only given a chance and another role like this one to showcase his talent. The Green Mile is touching,warm,and above all else a very realistic portrayal of the very real demons men face everyday. Even in a place like Cold Mountain prison and on Death Row where men await that last walk down the Green Mile.",10,1,4,23 July 2007

The plot is really simple a killer shark invades the waters off of a summer resort town and kills some people the Police chief Martin Brody wants to close the beaches the greedy mayor refuses to and puts more people at risk so he gets Matt Hooper a Shark expert from Wood's Hole to help him capture the Shark. Hooper is out of his League Enter the film's most colourful and memorable character Quint wonderfully played by Robert Shaw If Brody is the town's Heart and conscience Hooper the young Hero Then Quint is the modern day Ahab who becomes obsessed with killing the shark for 10 thousand dollars. the three end up on Quint's Boat the Orca and Hunt the shark in the films most memorable moments The Highlight is when Quint tells us about his time on the ill-fated USS INDIANAPOLIS and the deaths of the crewmen after the ship sank. Robert Shaw delivers a chilling story that creates it's own moment in Jaws. Spielberg shows us the genius that became his trademark he crafts a well honed movie with realistic people with flaws like us as they battle the monster only to find it's not the only monster haunting Amity. Wonderful film and richly deserved Classic. 1,10,1,3,15 October 2009
The Wrestler," Randy The Ram Robinson A loser who is a winner in the end.
",The wrestler is that rare movie that has a documentary feel to it you actually believe that this is the life story of Randy The Ram Robinson a former major star in the wrestling world think of Hulk Hogan/Randy Macho Man Savage. The Ram has seen better days where once he would've been a king in The Arenas and stadiums he's now forced to wrestle in school gym and community centers. He's abused his body with steroids and drugs. the problem is The Ram's Heart might be big and it might be the heart of a Champion but it's run it's course. The Ram has a heart attack following a particularly intense match involving staples barb wire and glass. The Doctors tell him he can't wrestle anymore the drugs and steroids are not helping but The Ram's heart isn't that young anymore the stress and strain of wrestling is too much. Forced into retirement the Ram is Forced to conform to real life and the rules of real life. He tries to get more hours at the grocery store where he works only to find he has a boss willing to take advantage of him and he is determined to be cruel as well to him. There is also a budding romance with a equaling aging Stripper named Cassidy. She's in the same boat as The Ram stuck in a career as a stripper and being passed over for the younger women. Both see more then a little bit of themselves in each other both have been hurt and beaten down by life. Also The Ram has a enstranged daughter he wants to make peace with her anger at him blisters the screen. As the Ram tries to live a normal life there is still the siren call of the ring calling him back to action for one more big match. As The Ram says 'It's not in the Ring I get hurt it's out there in the real world I get hurt!' Mickey Rourke deserves all the praise that he's been given for this movie it's a comeback well deserved HE makes this movie. the only drawback I feel is Marisa Tomi's Cassidy she is not well fleshed out and comes across as a foil strictly so The Ram has someone to talk to she needed to have been more worked out but still despite being a underwritten part it is a much needed part and the movie is the better for it. This is the must see movie of the year see it for yourself and you Don't have to be a wrestling fan to know and enjoy this movie.,Null,0,1,1 May 2009
Dark Shadows," Welocme to Collinswood. My Name is Barnabas Collins
","Dark Shadows was a classic TV show that ran until 1971. However Dark Shadows the show had years to wrap up it's run this movie only has a couple of hours. Barnabas Collins is the rich son of the owner of Collinsport he lives in the mansion Collinswood. the year is roughly 1752. When Barnabas Rejects the love of angelique,She is driven to the dark side and finds a way to curse him with becoming a vampire. She also kills his true love Josette.

He returns home to Collinswood. And it is there he meets his family and the nanny. Victoria Winters is a young lady with a secret. But then again they all have secrets. The film quickly moves into Barnabas fighting to restore his family to greatness once more. and to destroy angelique for what she has done . He also struggles with his curse and fights to find a cure.The Film is dark in some places light in others and it resembles a 70's vampire film. Still while it bears the names and the basic storyline it is not the TV Series. Dark Shadows the film is a honest effort to retell one of the classic Vampire stories of the Television era. Johnny Depp portrays Barnabas Collins in such a Fried like manner that you know he is doing this as a tribute to Jonathon Fried and a love for the Barnabs Collins character.Worth seeing. I enjoyed it a lot because it was different then any of the films released in 2012. And that's a good thing.",Null,1,3,27 December 2012

That piece is the agent's wife Superbly played by Charlize Theron who matches will smith step for step quip for quip she makes Smith Better by not underplaying against him instead she makes him Act stronger which is all the better for us. Now the bad parts are this the movie while quite good comes across as uneven in some scenes the story feels unpolished and quite rough this is not Will Smith's best film but it's not his worst. The directer Peter Berg starts out with great intentions but it feels as if he lost steam along the way and decided to use a short cut to finish the film. I felt cheated somehow as if the movie promised one thing and delivered another oh to be fair I enjoyed it quite a bit it just was not what I expected it to be.,Null,3,7,17 December 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Lord Vader RISE (May have spoilers)
","Star Wars III is perhaps on of the best films in the Series. Why do I say this? Everyone knows Lucas himself said this film would be the Turning of Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader. A Jedi Knight into a Sith lord. The movie moves with a quick pace and it answers all the questions. How did the Jedi Die? How did Anakin become Darth Vader? Why does he wear that mask and Helmut and Armour?

Slowly bit by bit the chancellor is drawing Anakin into a web. Palpatine orders The Jedi Council to put Anakin on the Jedi council They relunctly comply but tell Anakin they will not grant him the title of Jedi Master.This drives a wedge between them and as palpatine draws them into a trap he gives them information that will lead the Jedi into traps. Anakin discovers the truth that palpatine is a sith lord and he is trying to tell Anakin he alone possesses great powers that can stop Padme from dying.

'You were the chosen one you were meant to bring the force into balance not leave it in darkness,You were supposed to destroy the sith not become one of them.You were my brother Anakin and I Loved you' To which a Enraged Vader can only scream'I HATE YOU'! the film ends with Vader being placed in his armour and Obi Wan and Yoda helping padme deliver the twins Luke and Leia and they watch her die. The film ends with the twins placed in their new homes And With Obi-Wan helping watch over Luke. This may be the most emotional Star Wars film ever made and it certainly is one of the greatest.",10,6,12,27 November 2010
Ray," He overcame the darkness to become a legend.
",Ray is one of those movies that makes you pause. You actually think about what you heard or think about what you read about this man and it doesn't even come close. During my first viewing of Ray I forgot I was watching a movie I felt like a peeping tom watching this man's life thru a window. This movie is so compelling it drags you in and it involves your every emotion you go thru a emotional roller-coaster ride and when it's over you don't want to do it again so soon because it has that kind of emotional punch that other movies are lacking. Jamie Foxx deserved his Oscar and quite rightfully so his performance is spectacular and it should be held up as the standard for anybody wanting to do a bio pic anytime soon. This movie is as good as it's subject both deserved the titles classic and legend.,10,1,2,27 February 2007
WALL·E," What if someone had forgotten to shut the last robot on earth off?
",WALL-E is that kind of magical film that transplants you from the first scene to the last. the story is original. What if after Years of contaminating the planet man is forced to go into space to survive. A corporation BNL has created a fantastic city in space called the axiom. There every possible conceivable need is fulfilled by machines. The Axiom is only meant to last five years while armies of robots called WALL-E's are sent to clean up the earth. Somewhere down the line the plan to clean the Earth and recolonize it fails. Fast forward 700 years later and the last WALL-E is still working still fulfilling his primary function cleaning the planet. WALL-E is lonely he's Bored he's still excited by his job collecting trash and packing it up. He's gotten a hobby collecting things that fascinates him. Then Comes EVE a robot sent to evaluate the Earth's progress EVE meets WALL-E and Sparks fly. until she discovers thanks to WALL-E that Earth is now capable of sustaining life. When EVE leaves A love sick WALL-E follows and The adventure of a lifetime Really begins. The movie creates a incredible universe with robots falling in love people finding hope and comedy lots of comedy. My 5 year old son loves this movie it speaks volumes to him about love imagination and of course taking care of the planet. What I got from it is this is not a kids movie it's a movie for everyone young or old human or robot WALL-E is that movie with the clichéd heart of gold. There is no missteps here this movie is Pixor's best. It doesn't have the heavyhandness of Finding Nemo or the stumbling around of TOY STORY 2 . WALL-E is simply what movies should be about Entertainment excitement and a love of life itself. Now please will the last person on earth please NOT shut the last Robot on earth off!,Null,1,3,4 December 2008
The Conjuring," Eerie and creepy.
","The Conjuring is based on a actual case from the files of Ed and Lorraine Warren. I have read enough accounts of the Warrens to give them credibility. And I've read into this case which took place over ten years. The movie compresses it into one year span 1971 to simplify things. Which is great in terms of telling the story. In 1971 the Perron family after several incidents in a city which shook them to the core those incidents were violent and scary enough for them to move to the country. they found a farm house which was perfect for their needs. Large enough for the large family a peaceful river running in the backyard and peace and relaxation. However the Farm House was abandoned and sold at a auction. When they bought it they didn't know it had a violent history. When they find a boarded up cellar filled with junk. An old piano and other broken pieces of furniture. It seems that when they uncovered the cellar one of the more evil spirits was allowed to roam the house again. And it hates the living. After several horrifying events. that has placed the family in danger they seek out help. Enter the Warrens, Ed and Lorraine Warren are professional Ghost hunters who work with the church to banish evil entities. When The Warrens go to the Perron's home they find a evil that is ancient and terrible. And Horrible in it's wrath. They stay to help the family fight the demon. Only to place themselves and their family in danger.Hollywood takes liberties with the actual story but in this case it can be forgiven. After all they compressed a ten year case into a two hour film. And kept all of the scares intact. and made a credible and compelling film.",10,0,2,15 August 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Knightfall over no man's land
",The Dark Knight Rises is one of those rare third films that succeeds.Unlike other third films to other series like Spider-Man 3 or Godfather III. Christopher Nolan said he was finished with Batman after this film and he proves it. But he ends the film on a positive note giving the viewer hope.Bane captures Gotham City and cuts it off from the rest of the world. Armed with a nuclear bomb that in a few months will decay and go off. This brings Batman out of retirement to fight bane. Batman loses. Banes transports him to a prison in a south American country that was his home as a child .The Prison is escape proof trapped among the inmates with a broken Back. Bruce Wayne struggles to come back he struggles to Rise. The story is one of redemption. and heroes. Gotham finds in itself a lot of darkness that gives in to Bane. But it also finds Heroes. John Blake is a cop who inspires the city to never give up and Commissoner James Gordon who Teaches Blake how to be a hero.When Batman Rises and Returns to Gotham City it's a all out war for the soul of a city.Nolan crafted a story full of layers and hidden depths. This film starts out on one note and ends on another.Nolan doesn't ignore what he created in Dark Knight he builds upon it. He creates another level to the Batman mythos and gives us the ending We deserve. All around the acting is solid. The Story is wonderfully written and is a incredible finale to the Dark Knight legend.,10,4,11,8 August 2012
Iron Man," I am Iron man!
","Iron man great film. It is more faithful to the comic book that inspired it. Robert Downey JR is the film he hits the ground running from his first scene and never stops running, RDJ plays Tony Stark like a lazy Howard Hughes/James Bond wannabe with a little bit of Hugh Hefner tossed in. He does not lack confidence and he almost has a childlike naive way of looking at life. Until a life altering and threatening accident places him in the hands of terrorists who demand he create a weapon for them. Stark creates something but not for them he creates a Armor with enough weapon power to take out an army which he proceeds to do. once home he realizes that he must take account for his actions his company makes weapons of mass destruction he must make amends thus is born Iron man a avenger out to protect the world from those who terrorize and commit atrocities on a massive scale. Jeff Bridges is superb as Stane, Stark's partner who betrays him and creates the Iron Monger a suit more powerful then Iron man's. the battle scenes are breath taking and suspenseful This movie delivers on all cylinders and fulfills any Iron man fan they even play Black Sabbith's IRON MAN and you know the movie is going to be fun when it pokes fun of itself by playing it over and over again specially in the background. One thing I must admit is this . the director made a movie better then the comic from which it came. This movie is a family movie deep down in it's iron plated heart it delivers action some romance some development in the form of Tony Stark as he grows from a spoiled man who does not take any accountability whatsoever for his actions to a Iron Plated hero out to not only take responsibility for his actions but those of others as well. This movie left me wanting more Iron Man and hopefully soon.",Null,2,3,25 October 2008
Tombstone," Hell comes to Tombstone.
",As many others pointed out. Tombstone is the definitive Wyatt Earp film. In some cases it's historically accurate. And in some cases it's not so accurate but who cares ? The real movie is Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer as Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday. It helps that they had the good sense to bring Sam Elliot on board as well. Elliot is The Western actor to turn to since John Wayne died.Tombstone tries to tell the Story of the Gunfight at the O.K.. Corrall. The Events leading up to it and the events after.Russell steals the film as Wyatt Earp making a classic portrayal of a classic historical figure. And Yet Val Kilmer becomes the whole show for his portrayal of the doomed yet honourable Doc.I saw it when it came out in the theatre. And I watch it every now and then and I'm always amazed by how well a job they did. Always worth seeing just for the incredible acting of Val Kilmer. And always worth seeing Kurt Russell making Wyatt Earp a little bit more human.,10,0,2,8 September 2012
Casino Royale," Meet James Bond Secret agent 007 for the first time.
",I recently saw Casino Royale and walked away very very impressed. I have been a big Bond fan since at least the sixth grade and read all the Fleming Bond novels by grade eight. I always saw Sean Connery in my minds eye as Bond. But Daniel Craig did something very impressive he pulled it off. He is Fleming's James Bond brought to life a cold arrogant assassin who works for the government. Craig's performance was superb he is James Bond. Now the movie took liberties with the book which I recently re read but I was so surprised by the fact that while they made changes to the story they kept the flavor of the book they kept it gritty and action packed. Did this movie keep my attention YES. Will I see it again Yes am I a fan of the Daniel Craig James Bond Yes. Let's hope the next few Bond's he makes are as good as this one or if not better.,10,0,4,10 January 2007
Saving Mr. Banks," The making of a classic.
",saving Mr. Banks is a wonderful film about real people who have real problems. Back in 1961 the words child abuse were never uttered. There was Love duty and devotion. Achild took what was given to them and made the best of it. Even if it scarred the adult lurking inside.The Film opens with Mrs P.L.Travers facing the loss of everything. Her Mary Poppins books have stopped selling. She will not write anything more . and most of all she is faced with losing her home. But there is one flicker of hope. Walt Disney has reached out to her. and wants to buy the rights to Mary Poppins. Disney Wonderfully played by Tom Hanks . Has been chasing the rights to Mary Poppins for over 20 years. And Now he might have his chance. But Travers isn't that foolish. She wants Mary Poppins done her way or not at all. She demands script approval Casting approval and whatever else she can get her hands on. Disney it seems is willing to co operate as far as he can. But Travers is such a hateful vindictive woman that working with her is a mission impossible. Nothing goes right for any of them Travers refuses to budge. The smallest things Set her off . She hates moustaches and when Disney orders Mr. Banks to have one she flies into a tantrum. No one knows why until she leaves in a angry huff. and buys a plane ticket using her real name. Disney uses that and tracks her down to England where they have a heart to heart talk. and they realize they both have the same demons. Except Disney refuses to let his win. Travers melts a little and they finally make Mary Poppins. Travers still hated it . The Story is quite good. the acting is believable. Saving Mr banks is a movie that should have won an Oscar for Tom Hanks . And Emma Thompson. But the real tragic end to all of this is P/L. Travers died alone. as her son said loving no one and no one loving her. That is a tragedy of epic proportions . MAybe thanks to this movie she could be understood better.,10,0,2,1 September 2014

RED," Just because they're old doesn't mean they can't kick your butt in a fight.
",RED is a gem of a movie it doesn't take itself too seriously and manages to have fun and toss in a few twists and turns. The Story is: Frank Moses is a retired CIA black Ops agent and he's been retired for a few years bored and alone his highlight comes when he speaks to his pension case worker a young girl named Sarah. then a hit squad attacks him and Frank strikes back and realizes that Sarah might be in danger. Anyone who was Associated with him might be in danger so he goes off to rescue Sarah and reassemble his old team to strike back. The real joy is watching Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman and John Malokvich and Helen Mirren interact they are the movie. The story is simple and made for action it was adapted from a comic book so don't expect any brain trust here. if you came to be entertained and relax or on the edge of your seat for a couple of hours then this is the movie for you. Bruce Willis amazes me he carries this film off so effortlessly that it's educational in watching him act like he's not acting and showing you how it's done With Style.,10,0,4,30 March 2011

The Actors all hit their marks beautifully and they carry this film wonderfully on their shoulders and create a Classic that equals Raiders of the lost Ark.
