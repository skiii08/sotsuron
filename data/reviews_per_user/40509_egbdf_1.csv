The Blair Witch Project," ugh!
",I'm glad I waited for the video.  I wouldn't want to pay full price for this one.  I got seasick watching it and the girl's voice (Heather) got on my nerves very quickley.  Scary?  Give me a break!  The only thing scary about this super hyped 'film' was that people actually paid good money to see it.,Null,0,0,20 November 1999
