The Blair Witch Project," Very Disappointing!!!!!
",I attended this movie with 'high hopes' and was thoroughly disappointed.  In no way did this movie even come close to scaring me.  The only thing it did was make me sick at my stomach from the amateur use of the video camera. I'm still waiting for that movie that really scares me & Blair Witch didn't deliver.  A BIG WASTE OF MONEY - ON MY PART!!! Don't be tempted to see it - you will come away wishing you had stayed home!!!,1,1,4,23 August 1999
