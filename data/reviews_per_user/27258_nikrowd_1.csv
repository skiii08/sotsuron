Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's Star Wars Alright
","Delivering on the promise made 15 years ago, Lucas has delivered a treat. Clearly catering more to the Star Wars fan than to the non-fan, the movie is filled with numerous inside jokes and references to the previous films, and divulges some plot details which, as they are developed in the coming two movies, should shed some interesting light on what we knew as the first trilogy, but shall soon see as the second.The movie is paced like all the others, with quick cuts and many things going on at once, and it keeps you interested. Ignore the critics who said it was 'slow to develop' or 'the effects outweigh the plot'. If you consider yourself interested in the plot of Star Wars, this has all the plot you'll need. And more. You won't be able to avoid speculating about the future.There are a few cheesy things that you'll find. At least a groaner or two, it seemed with the rest of the audience. But we've got good space battles, good ground battles, and DARN good Jedi action.And don't forget Warwick Davis, sans Ewok or Jawa costume.But then, that's just my take. Lucas' take will be another billion to add to the two Pepsi already gave him for all those Taco Bell ads.",9,0,0,19 May 1999
