Requiem for a Dream," What to say...
","This movie doesn't pull any punches, it doesn't soften any blows. Four people, four stories, four fates.Four examples. Each one different, yet each one the same.This movie depressed me, made me lose respect for humanity, watching four people systematically destroy their lives can be a draining experience. But it can also teach.It builds up a connection, a willingness in the watcher to want them to somehow pull through, to overcome what is destroying them, and to somehow rebuild their lives.But in the end, they each got what they deserved.",9,0,1,4 July 2005
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Blessed are the cheese makers? What's so special about the cheese makers?
","Well obviously it's not meant to be taken literally, it refers to any manufacturer of dairy products.Very funny movie. I was first introduced to Monty Python with this movie, when I was about 5 years old. Even then I was laughing all the way through, though of course different jokes were funny back then. I remember collapsing to the floor it fits of hysteria in the space scene. As one grows older, the true nature of the comedy reveals itself however.This is a movie with a message in it, and the message is 'beware'.... or rather, the message is think about your life, think about who you are and follow yourself. Believing in something is fine... just don't follow blindly. Question your faith, and if you find answers that strengthen it, then you've found something special.All those who find this movie blasphemous obviously haven't learned how to work it out for themselves.Terrific race the Romans... terrific.",Null,0,2,28 November 2002
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Better than I expected. *Some spoilers*
","Terminator 1. Great movie, scaringly believable plot... setting standards. Time is immutable. The only reason John Conner exists is because SkyNet tried to terminate his mother in the first place. The machines had no way of knowing that, so they tried anyway.Terminator 2. Still a good movie, better action... plot with more holes than a slotted spoon. We change how things happened, so much so that by the end of the movie we are led to believe that the war never happens. In direct contrast to the standards laid out in the first movie.Terminator 3. Better than both it's predesessors. Action ten times better than the first two combined. The plot? Some of you may have missed it hidden way in there behind all that action, but it was there. Not a whole lot of it I admit, but it was there.*Spoilers here* So is time immutable? No. Is time an easy thing to change? No. What happened in T2 was such a huge event that it shook up the future enough to delay Judgement Day for years. We believe that the loop was broken after T2, but instead we find that the loop has simply changed. But now the war's started, now there's no turning back. The resistance will arise, John Conner will lead humanity towards victory... but not before sending the man he knows is his father back in time to his doom. Will it happen differently? Not at first. Not at second either, John will want to make sure it happens the same way. Only this time round, John knows he's going to be killed before the third Terminator is reprogrammed... he'll be ready. SkyNet doesn't know any different.So what happens next? Simple, John wins the war against the machines, we already know this... and the shattered remains of humanity begin anew. But there's a difference. There are probably a many number of events that could unite all of humanity towards a common goal... and that would be one of them. In this new future... we stand united. We stand as one.This story, is over.",8,1,1,18 July 2003
X2: X-Men United," *drool*
","I went into this movie expecting some pretty cool action, a semi-decent storyline, some good lines, and Wolverine.I remember sitting down after paying, and watching the opening scene. Nightcrawler in the White House.I remember thinking: 'Holy hell!! I've already had my money's worth!!'The rest of the movie could have been horrible and I wouldn't have minded.Then the rest of the movie played. While the overall quality never quite reached that of the opening scene, it did not fail to please.I left that movie having seen some awesome action, a surprisingly detailed plot, truck loads of kick-ass lines, Wolverine... and Nightcrawler.I was pleased.",9,0,0,14 October 2004
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," My thanks.
","I would like to extend my thanks to the wonderful cast of this movie. Starting with the many camels, llamas and mooses. And of course the Moose trainer, who's job could not have been easy.This is a movie that, although it has been viewed by nearly everyone many countless times, we still go back and watch it again and again.It takes us on a wonderful journey with swallows and knights. Monsters and coconuts.I would recommend this movie to anyone who's still in touch with the child within. The humour combines a perfect blend of intelligence and wit, yet never strays too far from just sheer sillyness.Oh no!! It's the legendary black beast of ARRGHHH!!!!!..........",10,0,0,11 October 2002
