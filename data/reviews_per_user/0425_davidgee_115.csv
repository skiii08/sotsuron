The King's Speech," Shining a light on the monarchy
","George VI's stammer seems like an unpromising subject for a film treatment, but what a highly polished gem this small-budget movie is. Like THE QUEEN, it gets off to an unpromising start. Just as Helen Mirren took a while to get used to as Elizabeth II, so Helena Bonham-Carter doesn't look much like a younger version of Elizabeth's namesake and brown-toothed old mum (a National Treasure, of course!). Michael Gambon looks a bit like George V and Timothy Spall makes a nice jowly growly Churchill, but Colin Firth and Guy Pearce are nothing like the royal brothers George (Bertie) and Edward (David, later Duke of Windsor). Anthony Andrews (who once played Edward VIII in a dire mini-series) seems out of his depth as Mr Baldwin, but there's an excellent Chamberlain and Eve Best makes the best Wallis Simpson since Who-was-she? in the Edward Fox TV version of The Abdication which set the gold standard. Claire Bloom and Derek Jaconi contribute fine cameos as Queen Mary and Archbishop Cosmo Lang, representing the 'Old Guard'.What matters, of course, is not how good they look but how well they play, and they play very well indeed. Much like Mirren in THE QUEEN (again), Firth and Bonham-Carter inhabit the roles and convince you that this must be how the Prince's/King's impediment was overcome. Lionel Logue, the rough-diamond Aussie voice coach, is a gift of a part, and Geoffrey Rush attacks it full-on. He must be a shoo-in for every award going; Firth and Bonham-Carter are pretty certain to get BAFTAs, but the Oscars are sometimes more whimsically awarded.The actual Abdication (and the 'woman I love' speech) have been done too often and this version adds nothing new, but there's a nice moment when Elizabeth snubs Wallis at a gaudy party. If I have a quibble with the writing, it's over Logue's insolent insistence on calling his pupil 'Bertie'. Even if this was the case, it doesn't ring true; I can't see how calling him 'Sir' would have reduced the effectiveness of the regimen. Some of the treatments make for jolly viewing - singing and swinging arms and shouting F-words (Elizabeth sitting on Bertie's tum may be far-fetched, but it makes for a charming scene) - and when he is put to the test on the BBC, you positively ache for it to go well.Comparisons with THE QUEEN are hard to avoid. Both films shine a light into corners of the palaces we don't normally see, but it's done tastefully and tactfully. Our heritage - the Monarchy itself - is in no way diminished. The Queen Mum comes out of it particularly well. Plaudits to all concerned.",9,1,2,11 January 2011
Blade Runner 2049," Did I lose the plot?
","I'm not often lost for words, but I really don't know what to say about this belated sequel to Ridley Scott's 1982 BLADE RUNNER. The original was visually stunning and densely plotted. This new version is even more dazzling to look at, but if there's a plot to be found, I'm afraid I lost it. Ryan Gosling plays 'K', a new generation hunter of rogue androids for the LAPD. In other words he's the new Deckard (Harrison Ford) who was hunting rogue androids in 2019 Los Angeles (the 1982 movie was set in 2019). But he ends up tracking Deckard who has himself (I think) gone rogue. There are humans who may be androids and androids who may be humans, but this confusion was a major element in the first movie and there's a lot more of it now.At two and three-quarter hours the film is way too long. There's a protracted sequence towards the end in (I think) Las Vegas, in an arena peopled by flickering holograms of bygone stars (Sinatra, Monroe, Elvis, Liberace), which for me encapsulated the whole movie: a feast for the eyes but overkill for the brain. High concept - low impact. Don Siegel's 1955 INVASION OF THE BODY-SNATCHERS is still my favourite sci-fi.Doubtless the fault is with me but I came away, as I did from INCEPTION and SHUTTER ISLAND, with the feeling that I'd been looking at the Emperor's New Clothes. I wouldn't say Don't go to see this picture, but be prepared to be very (very) bewildered.",3,33,73,11 October 2017
The Monuments Men," A barrel of gold teeth is the (only) telling moment
","This is a movie which it's easy to watch but harder to approve of. Particular emphasis is placed on a medieval altarpiece and a Michelangelo sculpture of the Madonna, both looted from two churches in Belgium; other works were taken from national collections, but the film also acknowledges that the vast majority were taken from the private homes of wealthy Jews.In one of the salt-mine hideaways Clooney's team open a barrel filled with gold teeth, a chilling reminder that the Jews were robbed of a lot more than their paintings when they were dragged from their homes and transported to the Eastern death camps. The film needed more moments like this. The overall feel of THE MONUMENTS MEN is of a 'caper' or heist story along the lines of THE DIRTY DOZEN or WHERE EAGLES DARE. 1995's THREE KINGS did a better job of combining a thrilling treasure hunt with a harrowing vision of terrorisers citizens. George Clooney's character, in defensive mode, more than once argues that the theft of great art is the theft of a nation's cultural heritage. This is true, but the real cost of war (look at Syria and Libya today) is the cost of lives and livelihoods. Yes, this mission saved thousands of precious paintings and sculptures, but the Holocaust and the destruction of entire countries needs to be remembered as more than a background detail.",Null,1,1,26 February 2014
Source Code," The two Jakes
","Early in the movie Jake Gyllenhaal looks into a mirror on the commuter train and sees Sean, the passenger he's been 'zapped' into, staring back at him. This moment reveals the film's - to me - fatal flaw. Shouldn't we be looking at Sean in the train scenes and only see Jake in the time capsule scenes? Of course, this would limit Jake's screen time - unless he played Sean and the other actor played the time traveller.You can imagine how this was pitched: INCEPTION meets UNSTOPPABLE with a bit of GROUNDHOG DAY and THE TIME-TRAVELLER'S WIFE thrown into the mix. The mix is a hell of a mish-mash. The film's dynamic pace - and Gyllenaal's considerable screen presence - carry the story past its many inconsistencies, but it's only fun while you're in the cinema. Its internal logic is flawed, particularly in the way it works up to a 'surprise' ending which, when you think about it, isn't really that much of a surprise. How else could it have ended?",7,0,3,1 April 2011
Skyfall," Lots of thrills and one big shock
","Sam Mendes really has breathed new life into the 007 franchise. Not only is SKYFALL better than the woeful near-plot less QUANTUM OF SOLACE of Solace, you could argue it's even better than CASINO ROYALE and GOLDENEYE, the last two movies that attempted to give our superhero a much needed kick in the pants!What really works this time round is a decent script. Once the producers had exhausted Fleming's original novels, the screenwriters came to rely on cobbling together a few original fragments with some conspicuous recycling of previous highlights (ski and underwater sequences being the most blatant examples of this). There is a bit of under-the-counter re-vamping in SKYFALL: the stolen disc with agents' names reworks the nuclear-code device from FOR YOUR EYES ONLY (or even FROM Russia WITH LOVE's cypher machine). Javier Bardem's peroxided villain Silva is a camped-up version of Christopher Walken's Zorin in FROM A VIEW TO A KILL, but the sharpness of the new script and the tightness of Mendes's direction makes the film seem very far from formulaic.If you're a fan of the Fleming books (as I am!) Daniel Craig is so wrong to play Bond (physically, Tim Dalton came closest to the Bond of the novels, with Piers Brosnan a close second), but Craig has now stamped his seal on the part. SKYFALL, however, really belongs to Judi Dench. M's role here has been beefed up to its best since THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH. Dame Judi really seizes the bit, alternately ruthless and vulnerable. She ends up in the Highland scenes looking more like Bond's partner than his boss. Ralph Fiennes gives a nice turn as a creepy Whitehall mandarin who thinks M is past her sell-by date. Ben Wishaw is low-key as the new Q, from whom we can surely expect bigger things in the future. Naomie Harris is very appealing as the fledgling agent; her little 'surprise' at the end of the movie makes a pleasing 'coda' after SKYFALL's big shock (which must be one of Movieland's most successfully kept secrets of recent times). There are some pleasingly sly references to the Bond 'heritage' (Martinis, the Aston Martin, the original Bond theme and, of course, the obligatory 'Bond, James Bond').Adele's slightly plodding theme-song is not going to knock Shirley Bassey off the top of the Bond charts. The blowing-up of MI6's Thames House is not CGI's finest hour. Other 'set pieces' are a bit daft, especially the runaway tube-train which we saw in the trailer and even the Istanbul rooftop chase at the beginning. But the Shanghai highrise generates vintage thrills and the London scenes have terrific tension. The Scottish moors prove to be an atmospheric location and bring a well- paced movie to a seriously thrilling climax.",8,1,8,1 November 2012
Iron Man 3," Whiz-bang!
","This may turn out to be one of the summer's better blockbusters: a stylish superhero thriller in which the special effects don't quite swamp the story and the acting. With the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow and Rebecca Hall in the 'Bond girl' roles, we are clearly in a different ballpark from SPARTACUS on TV (not that I don't get a kick out of SPARTACUS!)The film starts a bit slowly and, as seems to be the case in all superhero stories nowadays, Iron Man is going through a 'long dark night of the soul'. Once we get past this guff and the mayhem begins, this third episode delivers the goods that teenage viewers have paid to see (in 3D). Marvel comicbook fans seem to be unhappy with liberties taken with the source material, but I thought it was terrific fun. As whiz-bang popcorn movies go, this one goes with a - well - with a big whiz-bang.",7,0,7,1 May 2013
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Zombies are getting savvier!
","This is a big improvement on my last two horror nights at the multiplex: PIRANHA and THE LAST EXORCISM. That said, it's pretty formulaic. A handful of survivors of the killer virus are holed up in a Los Angeles fortress prison surrounded by thousands of hungry zombies.Zombies are getting savvier with each successive movie appearance. They manage to tunnel and smash their way in - predictably. Also fairly predictable is who's going to make it to the final reel and who's destined to be zombie snacks. The plot leapfrogs from scene to scene with huge how-did-they-get-here gaps, but series super-heroine Milla Jovovich is in great shape and there's a splendidly hiss-able uber-baddie head of the Umbrella Corp. The 3-D is good and not too 'intrusive'. The zombie attacks are visceral without being too gross. There are some great sets and eye-boggling stunts.As video-game adaptations go, this pushes all the right buttons.",7,11,24,20 September 2010
It," Send in the Clowns
","The 1990 version of this, with Tim Curry as Pennywise the killer clown, was a 3-hour miniseries. This new edition calls itself IT Chapter One, so at least one sequel can be franchised (hopefully just the one). There are echoes of other Stephen King adaptations in this nerve-shredding visit to Derry, Maine (regular King territory), where there's a summer of child abductions and murders every 27 years.The whole movie is screened from the viewpoint of the kids, mostly the half-dozen plucky young teens who do battle with the monster in the late 1980s. They're a geeky bunch: one with glasses, one with a weight problem, one with a stammer, one with an over-protective mom. There's also a bunch of older bullies whom we remember from CARRIE (and GREASE and every other teen movie). And there is one girl, Beverley (Sophia Lillis, who has all the tomboy appeal that Jamie Lee Curtis brought to her early 'Scream Queen' roles); Beverley has a very creepy possessive single-parent dad. It seems weird that apart from glimpses of dysfunctional parents and teachers, there are no adults called in as the kids – on their own – tackle the new killer on the block.As horrors go, this one is pretty scary without too much resort to evisceration. The clown monster Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard, not as camp as Tim Curry but pretty evil) has bunny teeth which early on we see opening into a CGI shark array worse than Alien.This workmanlike version of IT (Chapter One) is faithful to the spirit of King's novel and is definitely up there with the better movies sourced from a book of his - with SHAWSHANK, MISERY, the original CARRIE and STAND BY ME still the front-runners (for me). Let's hope they make an outstanding job of Chapter Two.",Null,3,5,26 September 2017
Hereditary," Some recycling here
","HEREDITARY is a ghost story from the school of INSIDIOUS. An affluent family in a forested town in Utah experience spooky goings-on when a grisly accent kills their young daughter only weeks after they buried their beloved grandmother. The high-school-age son (Alex Woolff) goes rapidly to pieces, as does his mother, played by Toni Collette who makes her the most formidable character in horror movies since Kathy Bates in MISERY. Dad (Gabriel Byrne) tries vainly to hold the family together.The key character in the story is a neighbour, Joan, also bereaved, who dabbles in Ouija-board-style spiritualism. Joan is played by Ann Dowd, whom we know (and fear) as Aunt Lydia in THE HANDMAID'S TALE. Like Aunt Lydia, Joan seems to mean well but we are obviously supposed to wonder about her true intent.The casting of Dowd and Collette lifts this movie above the routine. Writer/director Ari Aster tries to give it the kind of epic 'grandeur' Stanley Kubrick brought to THE SHINING (a much over-rated film, in my opinion: it did not do justice to one of Stephen King's finest novels). HEREDITARY also has echoes of ROSEMARY'S BABY and that hoary old Hammer horror, THE DEVIL RIDES OUT. The ending is totally daft, and really there is very little that's new here, but you get a few nice jumpy moments along the way, and Toni Collette and Ann Dowd work very hard to elevate this story into the Gothic 'pantheon'.",7,0,2,22 June 2018
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," What a liberty!
","In between fighting the Civil War and abolishing slavery, Honest Abe Lincoln somehow found the time to clear the US of vampires! What a daft idea for a book or a movie (both actually).But it works! Well, sort of. You have to take a movie like this at face value. The film it has to be measured against is VAN HELSING, which had a special ingredient in the form of Hugh Jackman. Benjamin Walker displays none of Jackman's charisma, and even Rufus Sewell as the top vampire doesn't get to do much more than snarl and morph into a nightmare creature.The CGI is top-notch and the fights are well-staged. The 3D jumps out at you, as it should, although I didn't like the muted colour palette - a lot of sepia and night-scenes. But, as I said, taken at face value, this is a very enjoyable piece of hokum. But I'd rather have watched a sequel to VAN HELSING.",7,3,6,24 June 2012
John Wick," Mindless mayhem
","The theft of his car and the killing of his dog provide the motivation for an orgy of shootings and beatings. There's even a fight scene with a hit-woman, so that misogynists can get their jollies. Keanu Reeves obviously has bills - or alimony - to pay, which could explain his appearance in this schlock. Did Jason Statham and Nicholas Cage turn it down? Willem Dafoe, presumably also in need of a boost to his pension, has an inexplicable supporting role, and Ian McShane makes an appearance so brief it can't have paid much more than Extra work.The film is shot with pace and style, but the mayhem is endless, pointless, mindless. I normally avoid movies as bad as this; I should have avoided JOHN WICK.",4,3,7,18 April 2015
Rocketman," Elton: the Plain Unvarnished Truth. As if!!
","Hot on the heels of Rami Malek's Oscar-winning turn as Freddie Mercury, we have Taron Egerton going into camp hyperdrive as Elton John in this musical extravaganza charting the rise to superstardom of young Reggie Dwight from Pinner in suburban northwest London. This is not exactly the 'plain unvarnished truth', since once his career took off Elton didn't really do Plain or Unvarnished.Egerton does a great job capturing Elton's growly vocal style and his weird combination of shyness and monstrous egotism. It's a performance that rivals Michael Douglas's take on Liberace, who is briefly glimpsed on Elton's gran's telly and whom he clearly drew on for inspiration. As in CANDELABRA, the script doesn't hesitate to show the star's battle with homosexuality. Elton has a crush on Bernie Taupin (nicely played by Jamie Bell) who isn't gay but loves Elton and cherishes their Stan-and-Ollie/Eric-and-Ernie partnership. Elton has a stormy relationship with his second manager John Reid (Richard Maddon - fantasy-fulfilling to see him playing gay!). His happy-ever-after with David Furnish comes later than this timeframe.The other movie I was reminded of was MOULIN ROUGE in the way some of the songs are not just performed but acted into scenes that carry the story forward. Bell and Maddon both get to sing.Elton's addictions to booze, drugs and sexual excess (and shopping!) are not skated over, just as they weren't in the Liberace movie. ROCKETMAN is a story with a message about the dangers that fame brings with it. At another level it's simply a great musical biopic.",8,1,1,7 June 2019
A Star Is Born," A star is - loudly - born
","Two major revelations: Lady Gaga can act! And Bradley Cooper can sing. This is very much a remake of the Barbara Streisand/Kris Kristofferson version (1976) with 'country rock' songs rather than the 'Some Enchanting Evening' sound of the 1954 Judy Garland/James Mason version, which I still prefer. Funnily enough, the ending of this new movie does carry a strong echo of the Garland movie and a fainter echo of 'The Man That Got Away'.The love story works thanks to onscreen chemistry and quality performances. Gaga actually reminds me of Streisand in FUNNY GIRL: she brings that sense of a raw burgeoning talent. I'm not a fan of her singing: she has a shouty style that reminds me, not pleasantly, of Carly Simon. Bradley Cooper sings as well (and in similar voice) as Kristofferson in the 1976 version. He also directs with considerable flair and has an amazing screen presence. Not sure he'll get awards for this, but clearly his star, unlike Jackson Maine's in the movie, is rising.This is a loud, gutsy movie. I'm an old softie, I wanted more ballads.",7,6,11,24 October 2018
Gravity," Audience in peril!
","After all the hype I was half expecting not to like this movie but it was impossible not to be blown away by it. The CGI is totally 'awesome': there was never a moment when I didn't feel I was up there orbiting the earth with Sandra Bullock and the wreckage of her spacecraft. GRAVITY is as ground-breaking (space-breaking?), if not quite as 'trippy', as Stanley Kubrick's 2001 was back in 1968.There have been documentaries with more plot than this. Why would a mission to repair the Hubble Telescope need a Medical Officer? 100 years ago the Woman-in-Peril theme entailed tying her to a railway track. Here Bullock is adrift in space on her own for ten nerve-shredding minutes. Then the audience has to hold its breath for the rest of the movie wondering if she and and George Clooney can somehow beat the odds and make it back to Earth. I did occasionally wonder why Gorgeous George was cast in the role when maybe some younger hunk might given the movie a bit more teen-appeal. The same could be said of Sandra Bullock, I guess, but she acts her socks off, presumably entirely working against a blue backdrop for the CGI guys to fill in. You are with this woman every inch of the way. Top marks to her and the director and cinematographer - and those CGI people. This is an Audience-in-Peril movie!",8,1,2,20 November 2013
Darkest Hour," And the Award for Best Prosthetics ...
","Gary Oldman's take on Winston Churchill is already winning awards and hotly tipped to take this year's Oscar. Brian Cox gave a more thoughtful performance in last year's CHURCHILL, but he didn't win anything. That's showbiz, I guess.This version looks at the Great Man at the pivotal moment in his career when he replaces Chamberlain as prime minister of a coalition government in 1940, with the British Army facing annihilation at Dunkirk. King George is not keen on Winston (he championed Edward VIII during the Abdication crisis), and he has a 'mortal enemy' in Lord Halifax who thinks he should be leading the country. Churchill's decisions during the First War don't give him a good military track record.There are many scenes in dingy rooms and corridors in the war bunker beneath St James's Park. Even Buckingham Palace looks a bit dour. The movie's best scene, almost certainly invented, is when Winston takes the Underground from St James's to Westminster (a 90-second journey that here takes six minutes) and finds the people are keener to fight on than the Tory members of his Cabinet. I found myself thinking of Laurence Olivier's deliberately hammy Archie Rice in THE ENTERTAINER.Kirsten Scott-Thomas is a grander, less motherly Clementine than Miranda Richardson was last year. Lily James is charming as the PM's shy new typist. Everybody plays down against Oldman's shouty interpretation of Winston. His prosthetics deserve an award of their own and he captures the voice and the mannerisms as well as anybody else has, but other actors have given us subtler reincarnations that, unfairly it must be said, failed to attract the Oscar buzz.",6,1,3,24 January 2018
World War Z," Brad goes slumming in this load of (very enjoyable) tosh!
","Is there an intentionally Biblical parable in the spectacular incident at Jerusalem's infamous 'Berlin Wall'? Another stunning set-piece takes places on the airliner transporting Brad to (no kidding) Cardiff Airport. The climactic scenes at a besieged WHO facility in Wales are more firmly rooted in the George Romero or 28 DAYS tradition of zombie flicks, with Brad Pitt trying to avoid a smaller group of the Undead on a claustrophobic set. The ending does not seem to rule out the possibility of a sequel - WORLD WAR TWO? - if Brad wants to go 'slumming' again (Tom Cruise does it all the time).Pitt acquits himself well in his role, much as Dustin Hoffman did in the 1995 pandemic movie OUTBREAK but we would rather see our leading actors in roles where they're playing against something a bit more challenging than rampaging CGI monsters, wouldn't we? A lot of money was clearly spent making WORLD WAR Z and it shows, but this really is - how shall I put it? - a load of tosh. Hugely enjoyably tosh, though, and I look forward to sitting through a sequel or two. Luckily for us in the UK, a new series of THE WALKING DEAD has just started on free-to-view TV, so we can get a zombie 'fix' every weekend for the next four months!",7,2,8,3 July 2013
Passengers," Galaxy-crossed lovers
","The critics have been a tad underwhelmed by this space opera, but I liked it. It's a love story with a few echoes of 2013's GRAVITY, including seriously stunning CGI, but there is better chemistry between Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt than there was between Sandra Bullock and George Clooney.There's not a lot of plot: Chris and Jennifer wake from hibernation 80 years earlier than they should do on their universe-crossing starship and then have to cope with mechanical problems that threaten the vessel's survival. The pace is a bit slow until things start to go wrong with the nuclear reactor and with Michael Sheen, an android barman whom I found more than a little tiresome. The 'epilogue' is cringe-making but kinda charming.A part of me kept hoping for something out of the ALIEN franchise to bust in and liven things up, but no, this is just a slightly soppy story about a pair of galaxy-crossed lovers and – I'll say it again – I liked it.",8,1,3,17 January 2017
The Hunger Games," Kids killing kids - a worthy theme?
","I wasn't going to see with this and I kind of wish I hadn't. It's hard to believe this is the next Big Thing, after Harry Potter and the TWILIGHT series. Stanley Tucci, hosting the TV reality show in which kids hunt each other to extinction, combines everything you hate about Simon Cowell with everything you hate about Louis Walsh! Jennifer Lawrence occasionally has the arresting beauty of the young Elizabeth Taylor.Even if you haven't read the books on which this highly-publicised series is based, it's fairly obvious from the start who's going to survive and who isn't. A thin storyline doesn't really justify stretching the film well beyond two hours. The ending suggests that creepy President Sutherland (Donald, not Keifer, looking like a throwback to Abe Lincoln) has got some more gruelling games up his sleeve for Volume Two. Don't think I'll bother.The killing scenes - knifings, bludgeonings and arrows-through-the-heart - are not too excessively detailed, but there's no escaping the fact that this a movie about kids killing kids. Leaving aside the obvious borrowings from RAMBO, THE RUNNING MAN and PREDATOR, this is a disturbing theme for a movie to emerge from the country that went through Columbine and other high-school and college massacres. And it's especially disturbing to be watching it in the week when a Norwegian right-wing lunatic is on trial for murdering several dozen students.",6,1,3,29 April 2012
The Impossible," Best docu-drama since THE PERFECT STORM
","After last week's LIFE OF PI, another film that relies for its impact on spectacular Special Effects. Based on the true story of a Spanish family who miraculously survived the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami which killed over 200,000 people, THE IMPOSSIBLE makes them an English family, the Bennetts, who are in and around the swimming pool of their beach-side hotel on a Thai island when the great wave hits.The film has been criticised for concentrating on the fate of one white family when so many (mostly non-white ) people died in the disaster, but the director gives us glimpses of others caught up in this terrible event (some, we are told, played by people who were really there). And the dramatic focus on the Bennetts gives the viewer a sense of involvement: this could have been ME - and MY FAMILY. There are a couple of moments when the script seems to produce too many coincidences, and some of the scenes are unashamedly manipulative - tears are literally jerked out of the viewer.The film's 114 minutes fairly fly by. The family is very easy to 'identify with'. Naomi Watts and Tom Holland give vividly believable performances. The moment when the tsunami hits the resort has the most awesome impact since the sonically-induced disturbances in creaky old EARTHQUAKE (1974). This is the most exciting and most persuasive 'docu- drama' since THE PERFECT STORM. It's kind of awful to admit this, but I really enjoyed being taken back to the tsunami!",8,2,5,10 January 2013
Argo," Die Hard ending takes the edge of the 'docu-drama'
","The tension throughout ARGO is extremely close to excruciating. The scenes of fanatical mobs on the streets of Tehran (Istanbul stands in very believably) are seriously scary. A shot of a man hanged from a crane reminds us of the fate that would have awaited the six escapees hiding in the Canadian residency - and their 52 embassy colleagues who were held hostage for a year and a half. The Washington scenes have the frenetic bustle and urgency of TV's WEST WING. The drama goes slightly over-the-top in the final scenes at Tehran airport, with some DIE HARD moments that threaten to undermine the story's credibility. Overall though, with excellent performances, a taut script, and direction (by Affleck) that gives the flavour of a documentary, this is a nail-biter of a movie.",8,3,5,15 November 2012
The Danish Girl," Eddie Redmayne plays Garbo
","I found this a touching movie to sit through yesterday, but upon reflection today it's harder to take it quite as seriously as it takes itself. The early cross-dressing scenes have much of the charm of a Mozart opera,but during the many mirror-gazing scenes leading up to Eddie Redmayne's sex-change surgery, I began thinking of Greta Garbo, to whom the cameramen of her day also gave long moments of soulful introspection.Ben Whishaw also has an androgynous beauty; was he in the running for the lead role? Alicia Vikander's transition from wife to best friend, well played, is perhaps over-romanticised. Tom Hooper's 2010 Oscar/Bafta-winner THE KING'S SPEECH had the added charm of humanising our lofty Royals. In THE DANISH GIRL he's trying to do the opposite, to 'mystify' a pair of artistic misfits, and he succeeds, but less fluently. The cinematography is superb, creating harbour-scapes of Copenhagen that have the luminosity of Turner paintings. The film is only a little too long, a little too slow and maybe tries a little to hard to wring our heartstrings. But wring them it does.",7,0,1,6 January 2016
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Bring back The Mummy!
","From Jerry Bruckheimer who brings us lots of gutsy TV drama, this is a disappointing movie. The pace is leaden, there are too many identical fight scenes, and the characters are no more developed than in the video game. Jake Gyllenhaal is beefed-up eye-candy and sports a cut-glass English accent (is this Jake, or has he been dubbed?), but his Prince is a cardboard action man. Gemma Arterton is even blander eye-candy. Ben Kingsley's villain is straight out of 1950s children's television. The CGI is great, especially in the climactic cavern scene, but the movie stands up poorly in comparison with franchises such as The Mummy or National Treasure, which have more pace, more action, better scripts and simply deliver more fun. This is like a creaky old Errol Flynn swashbuckler with added Special Effects.",5,10,24,26 May 2010
Knives Out," Clunky 'tribute' to Agatha Christie
","As the key character, the Latina nurse, Ana de Armas majorly under-acts whilst everybody else majorly overacts, particularly Don Johnson, Toni Colette and Jamie Lee Curtis. Chris Evans, the bad-boy grandson, seems to be channeling Rupert Everett.Writer/director Rian Johnson is clearly torn between homage to Agatha Christie and a send-up. If you're going to spoof Christie, you need to spoof one of her grander whodunits like MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS. KNIVES OUT, with its gothic-ish country house setting, is more reminiscent of THE MOUSTRAP, Dame Agatha at her creakiest. The Sondheim-scripted THE LAST OF SHEILA (1973) was not good, but it wasn't as clunky as this.This is tosh - and really not 'quality' tosh. Mildly - very mildly - entertaining. After his Southern-fried piss-take on Poirot, it's gonna be hard to watch Daniel Craig back in his 007 tuxedo next year.",5,13,26,29 November 2019
The Irishman," Too loud, too long, too familiar
","As well as Scorsese's own previous trips down Mafia Memory Lane, two other obvious comparisons come rapidly to mind: Coppola's GODFATHER trilogy, which highlighted the Mafia involvement in trade unions, and Oliver Stone's JFK, which detailed the Mob's role in Kennedy's election and his execution.So, ground already covered and in similar detail. The 'novelty' here is the use of CGI to de-age the principal actors rather than have two players for each role. The de-aging of De Niro is fairly flawless, but Pacino's looks a bit weird and Pesci's (he seems to have been aged rather than de-aged) looks more like plasticine prosthetics. De Niro plays Sheeran much as he played Vito Corleone, a family man exterior masking a ruthless killer. Pesci gives us his familiar slightly shrill gangster 'shtick'. Pacino (who was so subtle in THE GODFATHER, shading from war hero to monster) is in shouty overdrive, reminding you of how loud (and how good!) he was in De Palma's SCARFACE. His Hoffa behaves like the president of a country rather than a union, but that's probably how Jimmy Hoffa was, another kind of gangster.THE IRISHMAN is loud and crude, way too long. It takes us into territory we've seen before, but it's also very watchable, very absorbing. I hope they aren't, but these may be 'swansong' performances from some of the finest actors of the last half-century.",7,2,5,9 December 2019
127 Hours," Courage in the canyon
","Yes, you do spend the whole movie steeling yourself for the scene you know is coming and, yes, it is a visceral scene many people will shield their faces from. But the strength of 127 HOURS is more than just the sum of its severed parts: director Danny Boyle makes you share the appalling isolation in Aron's predicament, and James Franco's performance, slowly cracking up as the hours and days crawl by, makes you yearn for the crisis to have a different resolution.Boyle fills the painful hours with flashbacks to Aron's family life (and girlfriend moments) and fantasy forward flashes to the life he doesn't expect to see again. There are a few scenes which have almost certainly been added to spice up the waiting time(e.g. the water-baby games with two girl hikers and the near-Biblical flood) and Aron's videocam episodes verge on the mawkish (justifiably perhaps), but even without them this thrilling and beautifully photographed movie would pack a powerful punch.Faced with a lose-lose situation like Aron's, how many of us would have the courage to do what he did?",8,1,3,21 January 2011
Spotlight," All the Pope's men
","There's a fine long tradition of films centred around newspaper investigations, going all the way back to THE FRONT PAGE in 1931 (which started as a stage play in the 1920s). SPOTLIGHT is at least as good as 1976's ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, the film most of us remember. The Boston Globe's revelations were clearly the Catholic Church's 'Watergate moment'.The script makes the Boston diocese and its archbishop the chief 'villains' in removing (and re-assigning) the offending priests; I wondered why there wasn't more speculation about just how high in the clerical food-chain the decisions to protect the Church's 'good name' were taken.Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton get top honours in the credits, but this is very much an 'ensemble' piece and I'm not sure any of the actors deserve to be singled out. Rachel McAdams is particularly good as the one dogged female in the team of Boston Globe journalists, and Billy Crudup is very convincing as a sleazy lawyer who's made a killing from out-of-court settlements between the diocese and some of the victims. Although their appearances are brief I would also applaud the men who play the victims, now adults but all still haunted by the abuse they suffered as children and teenagers (many were driven to alcohol, drugs, some even to suicide). Top marks to the writers and the director who have turned this grim and sordid story into a nail-biting thriller; I hope the awards season doesn't overlook them in favour of movies with big-name star turns. This is definitely my favourite of the pictures nominated for gongs this winter.",8,0,0,4 February 2016
Midnight in Paris," C'est magnifique!
","Woody Allen's best movie in years, happily reminiscent of PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO, the most endearing of his collaborations with Mia Farrow. Owen Wilson, standing-in for Allen himself, is klutzy without being self-pitying. Marion Cotillard is totally ravishing as Picasso's latest squeeze - as Wilson observes, she gives a whole new meaning to 'art groupie'.Kathy Bates was probably chosen to play Gertrude Stein because of her, ahem, physique but she dives into the role with relish. Corey Stoll's Hemingway not only looks a lot like old (or rather, young) Ernie but he is given the movie's best lines: he talks like he writes, short sentences with a lot of 'ands' and frequent references to guns, booze, lions and women. Cole Porter mostly sings. Zelda Fitzgerald mostly drinks while Scott frets. There are some good gags at the expense of Michael Sheen's annoying know-it-all art expert in the modern storyline when Wilson comes back with stories from the artists and models themselves. Wilson's airhead fiancée and his future in-laws-from-hell stop just short of caricature in a movie that relies for its existence on finding the balancing spot between parody and affectionate tribute.The transitions from Today to (more than one) Yesterday are achieved without any resort to special effects, the Paris locations and sets are simply 'magnifique', the music (lots of accordion) is almost too good. The mood is kept light and the whole film teeters on the brink of being lightweight without ever becoming crass.This would be a great comedy in any era.",Null,1,2,19 October 2011
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," World of shadows and Spooks
","If you've seen the 1979 TV series or read the book, you are likely to remember from the outset which of the quartet of suspects is the Kim Philby character, the 'mole' at the heart of British Intelligence in the middle of the Cold War. If you haven't seen the series or read the book - and maybe even if you have - the labyrinthine story and the opaque Pinteresque script of this new cinema version probably won't make much sense.A lot has had to be left out. The key character of Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong), damaged spy turned schoolteacher, and George Smiley's dogsbody assistant Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberpatch) are the only ones to have much depth to them. The four suspects are as shaded as the world they inhabit. Smiley himself (Gary Oldman) is the enigma at the heart of a mystery; his wife Ann is barely glimpsed, yet she has a vital role to play in the denouement.Good to see Kathy Burke back on the screen, although the part of Connie Sachs has been cruelly condensed and allows her to make little of the impact Beryl Reid had on TV. But the movie - like the book - belongs to Gary Oldman. His interpretation strongly evokes Alec Guinness - a bleary eye for the clues lurking in the background, the dogged determination to ferret out the truth of the treachery that threatens to undermine the 'Special Relationship'. This is up there with Joe Orton and Lee Harvey Oswald as one of Oldman's finest performances.The world of espionage has rarely seemed so shadowy. Most scenes are shot in dimly lit rooms and corridors. Outside meetings take place on sunless days. There is no sunlight in this movie, which has the darkest of themes: betrayal of your country, betrayal of your friends.But - BUT - for a more vivid, more up-to-date, more thrilling take on spooks, the series to watch is SPOOKS, just re-starting on BBCtv for what we're told will be its final outing. Good acting, punchy scripts and plots that belong to the complex international affairs of the age we live in now: these spies make Le Carre's look decidedly old hat!",Null,1,2,20 September 2011
The Way Back," Not quite in David Lean's league
","This is a good film that somehow manages not to be a great film. It brings to mind other stirring epics like BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI and LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, and you wonder if David Lean would have made it a truly great movie. What the escapees endure during their 4,000-mile journey is vividly brought to life (the Gobi desert scenes are especially harrowing), but because Jim Sturgess's character is the only one with a back-story, there's a lack of involvement with who these people are, and this fatally diminishes your interest in their fate.It's a far-fetched comparison, I know, but one of the best elements of THE PERFECT STORM was the way ALL the cast were fleshed-out characters, so that you really wanted each of them to somehow survive the great wave. Compare that with James Cameron's TITANIC: you know that 1,500 souls will perish, but the movie concentrates on a love-struck couple who weren't really there!Colin Farrell does a great job with a Russian accent but his character seems particularly pointless. Excellent acting from Ed Harris and Saoirse Ronan evokes sympathy, but they remain just 'cyphers' - the token Yank, the token girl. Peter Weir's direction is, as always, flawless; there's a great sense of the vastness of the swamps and deserts and mountains they have to cross.10/10 for the visuals, but only 6/10 for the writing.",7,4,12,6 January 2011
The Book Thief," A few good Germans
","The trailer for THE BOOK THIEF made it look like a new take on the Anne Frank story, but it's both more and less than that. The movie, like the novel on which it's based, targets Young Adults, so there's an element of Holocaust 'Lite' about it (as in last month's THE MONUMENTS MEN): the cinematography adds a glossy sheen to the horrors of World War Two. Nevertheless, we are shown Jews being beaten up in the street and marched off to the camps, so young viewers are not spared the ugly face of history. Having the story narrated by the Grim Reaper is an interesting device.If Liesel, our heroine (Sophie Nelisse), is perhaps a little too cutesy, her adoptive parents (Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson) are almost pantomine characters: the loving father and the flinty mother with a soft centre. All three actors were coached to do German accents of the 'Ve have vays of makink you talk' variety, which is seriously overdone and comes close to undermining the seriousness of the theme. But the central message of the story - not all Germans at that time were Jew- hating Nazi thugs - is delivered touchingly, if sentimentally. War brings out the best - as well as the worst - in people.",8,1,3,18 March 2014
Black Mass," Not so goodfellas
","This, we're told, is the true story of James 'Whitey' Bulger (Johnny Depp with a dubious hairline), an Irish American crime lord who 'ran' South Boston with savage ruthlessness in the 1970s and 80s but turned informer to help the FBI clear out Cosa Nostra rivals who were threatening his 'turf' in protection, gambling, drugs, all the usual rackets. So far, so familiar. The unusual element to this story is that Bulger's brother Billy was a rising figure in the Massachusetts state senate. One of the movie's great flaws is that it never makes clear why James's criminal activities, which regularly made the newspapers, had no apparent impact on the senator's career for more than twenty years.The movie's other great flaw is the 'so far, so familiar' element. Stories like this have been told before, with repeated scenes of violence and fusillades of f-words, in GOODFELLAS and with a lot less profanity and a lot more style in the GODFATHER trilogy. We see James ordering and even carrying out brutal killings, but despite the weird hair and weirder expressions Depp's performance has a slightly pantomime air about it: you don't feel the incarnate evil of Ben Kingsley in SEXY BEAST or Sean Penn in DEAD MAN WALKING. Cumberbatch has a good stab at Bobby Kennedy Boston, but does not look comfortable in the role. Joel Egerton is probably the best thing in it as the star FBI agent who finds that dancing with the devil puts his soul in peril. A gripping movie, even enthralling, but short on originality.",6,1,1,5 December 2015
The Town," Machine-gunned by F-words
","Whilst I agree with most of what other reviewers have said about the energy and originality of Ben Affleck's movie, I have a real problem with the amazing volume of F-words in the script. OK, I know people use them all the time, but two or three in the same sentence - and over and over - it's like being machine-gunned by the writer (also Affleck, in this case).Back in the bad old good old days, actors managed to convey menace and even pure evil without the use of profanity - an outstanding example would be Robert Mitchum in the original CAPE FEAR. Nowadays, if a writer wants to show a bad guy, he just chucks in a bunch of F-words. It's lazy writing - and lazy acting. Movies and TV plays where the F-word is used sparingly have a lot more impact.Call me old-fashioned - and you will! - I just wish there was a bit more SUBTLETY in Crime movies and Dramas.",7,0,2,20 October 2010
Life of Pi," Crowd-pleasing turn from Ang Lee
","You already know the story. Emigrating to Canada with his family on a rust-bucket freighter, an Indian zoo-keeper's son is the sole survivor when the ship goes down in a storm. Not quite the sole survivor: he shares his lifeboat with a zebra, a hyena, an orang-utang . . . and a magnificent Bengal tiger improbably named Richard Parker. Mr Parker soon eats his companions, apart from young Pi Patel who retreats to a raft made of debris strung out behind the lifeboat. They survive on the lifeboat's rations and some fortuitous fish catches until they beach on a floating island populated by mongooses (not mongeese, I just looked it up). Over time they reach an uneasy truce, but the script is at pains not to sentimentalise their relationship.Apart from Rafe Spall as the writer to whom the adult Pi is telling his tale (and a cameo by Gerard Depardieu), all the cast are Indians. Suraj Sharma, who plays the castaway Pi, is not one of those preposterously handsome Asian stars, he's quite ordinary looking (actually I was reminded of an Indian version of Labour leader Ed Milliband!) but as natural an actor as SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE's Dev Patel. The animals are mostly CGI but very believable, especially the fabulous Richard Parker. The storm scenes are spectacular; in 3D you almost need to put an umbrella up.The movie is perhaps a tad too long, but it's never tedious. The feeling of being taken on an adventure rarely lets up. Full marks to Ang Lee, a director whose career has taken many a crowd-pleasing turn. This is a magical alternative to the Christmas pantomime.",8,2,5,4 January 2013
Interstellar," In a galaxy far far away
","Christopher Nolan takes few prisoners in his movies. INTERSTELLAR assumes the viewer is familiar with the theory of relativity and the notion of fifth and sixth dimensions. So - a challenge to sit through for close to three hours. A challenge that tests - but rewards - the audience.Nolan pays homage to a whole raft of space movies, notably Kubrick's 2001 and Robert Zemeckis's CONTACT, with a time-continuum twist that I remember from a John Wyndham story called (I think) CHRONOCLASM. Although rarely boring, the film is a bit longer than it needs to be. There's a subplot involving Matt Damon in the galaxy far far away that seems clunky, and the science goes a bit wonky when McConaughey jumps into a Black Hole (perhaps Black Holes are open to reinterpretation). Where Nolan really hits the button is in the brave avoidance of 21st- century CGI in favour of some fine old-fashioned Special Effects. This gives INTERSTELLAR a lot of the visual magic that made 2001 such a mind- blowing voyage into the mysteries of the infinite.",8,1,4,4 December 2014
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Violence begets violence
","Rape, murder, cancer (and arson) - this movie pulls no punches. The billboards encourage a violent response and, as we know, violence begets violence. All the performances are gut-wrenchingly good, especially McDormand who wears her grief like an ever-present shroud. If I have one negative reaction it's my usual one to the relentless use of f-words (and even the c-word, although this is amusingly exchanged in one kitchen table scene between Mildred and her rebellious teenage son). The frequent shifts of tone from tragedy to comedy are brilliantly scripted.A tough film to watch, but a good one - even a great one. I'll be surprised if McDormand doesn't beat Meryl Streep to the podium at this year's Academy Awards. Mildred is one of those characters who will stay with you long after you leave the cinema.",8,3,5,20 January 2018
American Sniper," A war with no winner
","Bradley Cooper, bearded and beefed-up, sheds his glamour-boy image and delivers his best performance to date as real-life US Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, his country's best-ever sniper. who in four tours of duty in Iraq took out over 150 enemy combatants. Both in Iraq, where his team-mates fall beside him, and at home, visiting hideously wounded and mentally scarred veterans, Kyle sees the full horror - and the true cost - of war. The movie's final moments, subtly mixing diminuendo with crescendo, powerfully underline the theme that the end of fighting is no longer the end of a war.Men at war: territory that we've been visiting for decades. At 84 Clint Eastwood has lost none of his edge; his direction here is just as tight and edgy as Kathryn Bigelow or Ridley Scott.Sienna Miller is very convincing as the party girl turned home-maker who frets that Chris's devotion to his country is making him neglect his wife and kids. The tension in their marriage is finely balanced against the tension on the rooftops of Baghdad and Fallujah. There's not a lot that's new in American SNIPER, but it's two-and-a-half hours that remind us that in wars there are ultimately no winners.",7,4,18,20 January 2015
Lion," Schmaltz overkill
","As so often these days, the trailer for LION gives too much of the story away, including the ending, which robs it of any chance to surprise us. What did surprise me was how involving the story was. Sunny Pawar who plays the 5-year-old Paroo, marooned in Calcutta 1500 miles from his home village, is the most appealing and compelling child star since Joel Haley Osment. Both in India and in the early scenes in Australia after he is adopted by Nicole Kidman and her husband, he is gut-wrenchingly convincing as a lost little boy. Not just likable, this kid is utterly lovable.Dev Patel is someone we already like thanks to the MARIGOLD HOTEL movies, and here as the 30-year-old Saroo he comes pretty close to being lovable as well. Ms Kidman delivers one of her best-ever performances as the Aussie mum with a heart of gold. The script slightly loses its edge and some pace as Saroo wrestles with his memories and with Google Earth before embarking on the trip to be reunited with his lost family. His brother in Tasmania, another adopted Indian but with behavioural issues, gets forgotten in the final scenes – a careless oversight in a movie about abandoned siblings. The postscript, offering us glimpses of the real Paroo and his two mothers, comes close to schmaltz overkill but this is a picture that sets out to warm the cockles of our cold cynical hearts – and warm them it does (if your cockles aren't warmed you might want to think about a transplant).",8,0,2,25 January 2017
Captain America: The First Avenger," Old=fashioned hokum
","CAPTAIN America, with its WW2 setting and set-piece chases, reminded me of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade - and also of Dick Barton on the radio ('the wireless', as we called it back in the 1940s!).The transformation of Chris Evans (why is that name unfortunate to an English ear?) from scrawny nerd to super-hunk was a jolly piece of pseudo-science, but as Captain America Evans seemed a bit bland (super-heroes all too often are). I liked Hugo Weaving's Nazi mega-villain who looked like Dr No and had an accent somewhere between Doctor Strangelove and Doctor Kissinger.The plot seemed stretched rather thin in places and despite 3D and some cutting-edge CGI, the whole thing is a slightly old-fashioned slice of hokum likely to appeal more to the older generation - do they do superhero movies?",Null,1,5,10 August 2011
American Hustle," Jennifer Lawrence the best reason to see this
","Fresh from winning awards at the Golden Globes - including Best Comedy, this didn't really work for me - especially not as a comedy.American HUSTLE wants to be a sort of update of THE STING. But what THE STING had, in abundance, was a deftness of touch which HUSTLE only serves up in fits and starts. It gets off to a slow burn and it's a half-hour too long. Christian Bale is clearly trying to outdo John Travolta's comic sleazeball in PULP FICTION, but although his predicament is funny, his performance isn't. Bradley Cooper relies too much on his looks and misses the chance to be entertaining as well as gorgeous. The women are wonderful, as the Golden Globes have recognized, but I would have given the Best Actress award to Jennifer Lawrence rather than Amy Adams: Lawrence's blonde bimbo is in the league of those memorably fruity creations served up by the late great Madeline Kahn. The supporting men outshine the stars, especially Jeremy Renner as Mayor Carmine, venal rather than corrupt, a hugely likable 'Jack-the-lad'. Robert de Niro delivers an uncredited cameo as the 'Boss of Bosses', neatly spoofing Don Vito Corleone.There's a non-stop soundtrack of 70s disco and soul hits which helps carry the movie past some of its longueurs. Costumes and cinematography are ace, but for my money American HUSTLE just doesn't come off as a comedy. It's not as stylish as THE STING, which had pitch-perfect performances from its male stars, and it lacks the 'gothic' touches that allowed PULP FICTION to provide a whole new definition of the crime- caper movie. Jennifer Lawrence is the best reason to see HUSTLE. If she was up against Cate Blanchett in the Oscars (where there can only be one Best Actress), it would be a close call. Between Blanchett and Amy Adams, my money will be on Cate!",6,1,3,15 January 2014
Oblivion," A dog's breakfast - soulless and incomprehensible
","Take a mega-millions CGI budget, a charismatic superstar and a post- apocalyptic sci-fi theme and you may come up with a movie that's as thrilling as TOTAL RECALL (the Schwarzenegger original, not last year's crap remake) or as mystifying as INCEPTION - or you might just come up with a dog's breakfast like OBLIVION.I wish I could tell you the storyline but it defeated me. In a not-too- distant future, Earth has been devastated by aliens who have left pea- shaped flying gunships to eliminate the last few survivors (cue Morgan Freeman in a small and thankless role). The alien Mothership is a kind of giant jam puff run by Sally, a female version of our old chum HAL. Tom Cruise plays Jack Harper, a roving repairman employed (don't ask why) by Sally. He lives in an aerial penthouse with a see-through swimming pool: not the Ideal Home for anyone with a fear of heights. He has a female companion (Andrea Riseborough) who's a bit like a Stepford Wife, but then he rescues a mystery woman (Olga Kurylenko) from a crashed spaceship and begins to question his role on this ravaged planet and the history of its destruction. Are you still with me? To be honest, I'm not sure I'm still with me!Without Tom Cruise OBLIVION would be a turkey: he gives this soulless movie a human dimension and makes its incomprehensibility just about endurable. The story, we're told, comes from a graphic novel, but it seems little more than a mishmash of borrowings from the last 55 years of sci-fi: from 2001 through THE TERMINATOR and TOTAL RECALL to WALL-E. The CGI is seriously thrilling, but this visual feast is, like I said, a dog's breakfast.",5,14,25,18 April 2013
Man of Steel," The 1978 version was more ahead of its time
","The producers of this 'reboot' of the Superman franchise assume that we have forgotten the 2006 relaunch, in which Brandon Routh failed to wow fans despite his resemblance to the late great Christopher Reeve. Henry Cavill also brings echoes of Reeve: he is handsome in a Tom Cruise boy-next- door kind of way (only taller and seriously buff). New to superstardom, he also has a touch of gaucheness which serves him well in this interpretation.The storyline plays heavy-handed homage to the 1978 'original' and the first of its sequels with Terence Stamp as General Zod, who is the lead villain here (Lex Luthor seemingly in cold storage for the moment). Michael Shannon's Zod looks more like a rival superhunk than Bad Guy.) MAN OF STEEL has thrilling (if familiar) action scenes, a star with potential charisma and an A-list supporting cast. What it doesn't have is a coherent linear script. Trying hard not to simply revamp earlier versions, the writer and director have delivered an episodic story that's a bit like flicking through clips on YouTube. This is a small improvement on the 2006 version but despite 3D and advances in CGI, it's not as satisfying - and doesn't feel as far ahead of its time - as Superman did in the Seventies.",7,1,2,22 June 2013
The Revenant," Not the Last of the Mohicans
","There's a big Oscar buzz about this movie, which may have as much to do with it having been a gruelling location shoot as to do with the performances. Yes, DiCaprio is in terrific form, but so is Tom Hardy as the nastiest of the trappers, all of whom communicate mostly in grunts and mumbles. This film has the least intelligible dialogue since BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. The real stars are the director and cinematographer. The landscape plays the kind of dominating role that it always did in a David Lean movie. Alejandro Inarritu is perhaps Lean's true heir. And the film is beautifully scored. Soaring music and lingering snowscapes: pure David Lean. Glass's visions of his murdered native American wife (and son) provide poignant moments and provide a welcome contrast to the violent scenes which have the full-on shock of a body-horror flick.For me the story is told a little (maybe a lot) too slowly, making this a beautiful, yes, but, oh dear, a very long movie (2 hours 36). There have been quite a few 'Survival' pictures over the years (DELIVERANCE, CAST AWAY, etc. etc.) and now we see Survival documentaries on TV all the time. The movie I found myself comparing this to was THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS, which had many of the same elements - frontiersmen, 'friendly' as well as hostile Indians, battles against the French - together with an epic love-story, great music and great photography. What THE REVENANT crucially lacks is pace (and clear diction).",7,0,3,21 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," Tom Hanks, a 'warhorse' like Jimmy Stewart
","The role of James Donovan would have gone to Jimmy Stewart in years gone by and Hanks brings that same 'warhorse' integrity to the role: a man of modest intellect bringing more to his duties than was demanded or expected of him. Mark Rylance has a more challenging role, since Rudolph Abel is given very little back story, but as Donovan slowly warms to this cold enigmatic man, so do we, the audience. The trial scenes are inevitably slow and static, like their equivalents in LINCOLN and AMISTAD, but when events move to Germany this becomes as enthralling as anything else maestro Spielberg has brought us. Berlin in 1961 - a seamless mixture of set and CGI, presumably - is almost the real star of the movie, grim and oppressive: we see the Wall being built and some heart-wrenchingly desperate escapes. BRIDGE OF SPIES is history, with only a little jazzing-up (and some condensing of the time-line), so we know how it's going to end, but Spielberg and Hanks manage to generate terrific tension in the final scenes. This whole picture is a chilling reminder of the darkest period in East-West relations, hopefully never to be repeated.",8,2,5,9 December 2015
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Only intermittently thrilling
","I approached this without preconceptions, having neither read the books nor seen the Swedish movie version. This big-budget version has an appropriately Scandinavian feel to it: bleak, wintry and dark. Some of the characters attempt a vaguely Nordic accent; others (including Daniel Craig) wisely do not.The movie gets off to a slow start and goes on far too long. The pace only picks up when Mikael realises he's pursuing a serial killer and recruits Lisbeth to help with his research. The unmasking of the killer is not an enormous surprise, and the killer's 'back story' is out there in the twilight zone with the early life of Hannibal Lecter.Craig is much better cast in this kind of movie than as Pierce Brosnan's substitute. Rooney Mara will be an actress to look out for, although I thought the SM scenes with her lard-ass 'guardian' were superfluous to the central plot and a bit too unpleasant to watch. An interesting movie, but often tedious and only intermittently thrilling.",7,1,4,5 January 2012
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Ethan Hunt - not just buff but buffed!
","ROGUE NATION delivers more of what we expect from an Impossible Mission: super-stunts, chases (cars and motorbikes - again), shoot-outs, close-combat fights and (less than usual) rubber-face impersonations. Like 007, Ethan Hunt has been 'rebooted' for the age of Jason Bourne and Frank Martin, cranking up what was always the most fast-paced of the major action-hero franchises.The plot isn't exactly new. The IMF team are in disgrace after one of their operations is ruined by the intervention of a terror outfit called The Syndicate (think SPECTRE). A mystery woman (Rebecca Ferguson) appears to working both in and against the Syndicate, whose leader (Sean Harris) looks more like a mega-creepy serial killer (Francis Dolarhyde?) than a Goldfinger or a Blofeld. Ethan gets captured, gets free, gets captured again: it's plotting by numbers - except that the movie's forward momentum somehow carries you past the sense of familiarity.Ving Rhames's role seems to have been scaled down. Simon Pegg's, on the other hand, has been beefed up. But, of course, it's little Tommy Cruise (there's one brief scene highlighting his lack of height, a good gag) who carries the movie: he's not only buff but somehow buffed - with a kind of 'glow' to him, which may just be his sheer 'star-power' shining out of the screen.The locations - Vienna, London, Morocco - aren't ground-breaking, although the botched assassination during a performance of 'Turandot' at the Vienna State Opera is splendidly choreographed. Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie has polished a re-run of a well-tried formula and made it look (almost) reinvented. Two hours of crowd-pleasing high-voltage hokum.",7,1,3,7 August 2015
Dunkirk," Retreat for Victory
","Remember the opening scenes in Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN? The Normandy beach landings in June 1944. Explosions on the beach, bullets zipping through the guys in the sea. DUNKIRK offers the same visceral experience of combat, only it lasts for an hour and three quarters. There are a few moments of calm between battles and bombardments, but these are always the preamble to the next grim phase of the conflict.Christopher Nolan has directed some weird movies (MEMENTO, INCEPTION, the DARK KNIGHT Batman trilogy). His only 'weirdness' here is to take three separate time frames â€“ a week for the men on the beach, one day for the flotilla of small craft setting out to rescue them and one hour for the Spitfire pilots fighting the German bombers â€“ and meld them into a fairly seamless narrative that condenses the drama into a solid 90 minutes of nerve-shredding tension. The scenes onboard a sinking mine-sweeper are among the most harrowing depictions of the total horror of war I've seen.There are panoramic CGI shots to show the sheer size of the retreating army (400,000) but the script focuses on one soldier fighting to survive the day (Fionn Whitehead), one fishing boat captain (Mark Rylance) and one RAF pilot (Tom Hardy): these three are used to bring home to us that each of the soldiers and their rescuers had a backstory â€“ a home, a family, a life â€“ that they were laying on the line for their country, their king and their fellow men. A spot-the-celebrity element includes cameo appearances from Harry Styles, Michael Biehl and others whom I failed to identify. Kenneth Branagh and James D'Arcy play naval officers who occasionally veer close to the officers parodied in OH WHAT A LOVEY WAR! â€“ I hope this was intended.DUNKIRK joins the 'pantheon' of all-time great war movies and will surely win awards next winter. I was misty-eyed through much of it â€“ and not just because my dad was one of the soldiers who went to Belgium and didn't come back (I was two years old). There's a temptation to see the 'strategic retreat' from the French coast in 1940 as an awful defeat, when in fact â€“ as this version makes clear â€“ many of the 300,000-plus men who were brought safely home to England returned to Normandy in 1944 to begin the destruction of Hitler's military machine.",9,9,15,30 July 2017
Dallas Buyers Club," An uncomfortable trip down Memory Lane
","Matthew McConaughey's performance is the powerhouse at the centre of this movie. The script distorts the historical facts in small but significant ways to give the story momentum and to point up the desperation of the situation HIV patients were in back in those dark days when the only licensed medication was AZT, which was more killer than cure. Ron Woodruff (who was almost certainly bisexual) is here rampantly straight and stridently homophobic until his diagnosis forces him into the company of all those gay men who were the principal victims of Aids in its early days. Rayon, the drag queen who joins Ron in his life-saving enterprise and then becomes his buddy, is a fictitious character but a gift of a part which Jared Leto sinks his teeth into with the kind of relish William Hurt brought to KISS OF THE SPIDER-WOMAN (1985). Jennifer Garner gives a nicely understated performance as the overworked doctor who is not supposed to be sympathetic to Ron's efforts to circumvent the FDA.For those of us who lost many good friends and colleagues back in that terrible first decade of the Plague Years, this is an uncomfortable trip down Memory Lane. The final scene is ludicrously over-the-top but perhaps forgivable as an attempt to end this morbid movie on a brief high.DALLAS BUYERS CLUB succeeds at every level, entertaining us with the sheer pace of its story, overwhelming us with the mesmerising acting by Matthew McConaughey (who deserves all the awards that are coming his way) and vividly reminding us of the fatal ineptness with which successive administrations and the pharmaceutical companies responded to the challenge of HIV/Aids.",8,2,2,11 February 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Raising the bar on sequels
","The sequel/prequel element makes for a complex storyline and there are some 'borrowed' themes from the TERMINATOR and ROBOCOP franchises, but this doesn't interfere with the viewer's enjoyment of DAYS OF FUTURE PAST. The pace is terrific and the action scenes showcase CGI at its very best. I watched the 2D version, having come to feel that 3D doesn't actually add much to a good movie (or a bad one).Obviously you don't come to a film like this looking for great acting, but all the cast play their roles seriously without any pantomime send- ups. Middle age must be about to catch up with Hugh Jackman, but he's still a hunk. We mostly see the younger versions of Erik and Charles (Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy), but Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen pop up from time to time to add a bit of gravitas. Mark Camacho does a great job of recreating Richard M. Nixon, that most devious of presidents. There's a welcome surprise appearance at the end, and the suggestion that messing with time really does have consequences.DAYS OF FUTURE PAST really raises the bar on sequels and remakes. It may be the best X-MEN yet. It's certainly the best, so far, of this summer's blockbusters.",8,6,10,13 June 2014
Jackie," Channelling Helen Mirren - and Marilyn Monroe!
","I'd intended to pass on this, assuming it would be another soap- opera version of history, like the dire DIANA movie four years ago. But with Natalie Portman Oscar-nominated, it seemed worth seeing – and it is. The scenes recreating JFK's assassination and the state funeral are as harrowing to view now as they were in 1963, and the moments Jackie shares with the children, John Junior and Caroline, are exquisitely poignant. The movie's other main focus is on an interview between the First Lady and a reporter (Billy Crudup) in which she intends to secure her husband's historical legacy. To hammer home the inextricable link between the Kennedy White House and Camelot (Jackie demands the credit for this), we get to hear Richard Burton singing the show's title song – twice (a musical treat!).Portman's portrayal of the widow in the historical scenes is flawless, a woman forced to share her grief with the cameras and the Johnson Administration staff. In the interview scenes Portman alternates between insecurity and a kind of imperiousness that made me think she was channelling Helen Mirren channelling Elizabeth II. The tour of the White House renovations she did for television in 1961 is reconstructed, with Jackie all nervy and breathless and reminding me (how ironical) of Marilyn Monroe. Peter Sarsgaard makes a believable Bobby Kennedy, mainly required to be a shoulder to cry on. Caspar Phillipson is a good look-alike for Jack in the historical scenes, although Billy Crudup also has a degree of resemblance to the President, which I found disconcerting.I'm going to be the Grinch of the Season and say that, although this film does considerable justice to its subject, I don't think it deserves to win awards, but then I feel the same way about LA LA LAND, which is clearly heading for glory.",7,1,3,27 January 2017
Inside Out," Brain fodder for kids
","Not the kind of film I usually go to see, but saddled (I mean 'blessed') with my partner's children (5 and 7) on a rainy afternoon in Sussex, this seemed an easy option. (They call me 'Grandpa', by the way - out of respect for my age and the fact that I don't quite fit the Stepmom profile.) I think they were less dazzled by it than I was: no shoot- outs, no explosions, no witches and wizards.Most of the voices were unfamiliar to me (including Riley's and all the Emoticons) although I recognised Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan as Mom and Dad, and Frank Oz in a bit-part. The voices hardly matter: what matter are the visuals and the storyline; both are cleverly conceived and cleverly executed. Maybe some of the areas inside our heads make for slightly indigestible brain-fodder for younger tots, but I was charmed and enchanted. Another superb offering from Pixar that addresses the kid inside all of us.",7,2,22,26 August 2015
Yesterday," Even obliterated, the Beatles are the real stars
","Himesh Patel (whom we know in the UK from EastEnders) acts and sings his way persuasively through the slightly klutzy central role. Ed Sheeran almost steals the show, playing himself (a natural klutz!) in a charming send-up. Danny Boyle has directed this at a snappy pace, but the most visible contribution is clearly Richard Curtis's script, with his trademark mismatched love-story. Other erasures from human memory caused by the power-cut are fed to us at clumsy intervals - did CocaCola pay for product DIS-placement, I wondered? And the central mystery - what has actually happened to the Beatles? - is neatly addressed. I particularly liked the late appearance of two other people who know that Jack is a musical thief.The other most visible contribution is the Beatles' back-list - we are constantly reminded just how powerfully their songs are engrained in our consciousness. There may well be Sing-Along screenings of this next year.",8,2,4,4 July 2019
Bridesmaids," American Pie meets Sex and the City 2
","Funny and very very rude, this is one of those movies you almost feel guilty about liking. MURIEL'S WEDDING crossed with SEX ANMD THE CITY 2 and quite a lot of American PIE.Food poisoning in a bridal shop; Sex and City 2 and American Pie 1 had hilarious incontinence scenes, but BRIDESMAIDS blows (not the best verb) both of them out of the bathroom. Annie and Helen's 'showdown' at the bridal shower was a well-scripted high spot, creating the momentum for the turnaround moment and an irony-rich happy-ever-after ending.The characters really are not hugely different from Carrie Bradshaw and Co but well-rounded with everyone given good lines and comic moments. All the performances are outstanding except for Matt Lucas's cameo as Annie's house-mate; he's NOT given any good lines. And if the movie does appear to pillage every bridal-themed movie ever made, it recycles the material in a way that makes it seem original even when it plainly is not. Sometimes crude and even gross, BRIDESMAIDS had me laughing out loud from start to finish.",7,2,5,30 June 2011
Non-Stop," Where's the singing nun?
","There have been good and bad airplane movies, with CON AIR probably the best and some of the AIRPORT series among the worst. NON-STOP is somewhere in the middle, a bit up or a bit down according to your taste.Air marshal Liam Neeson's bosses think he's gone rogue and is hijacking the flight. While Liam is trying to figure out which of the passengers and crew can be trusted, the passengers are quickly losing faith in him.This is hokum, of course, but it's classy hokum, with Julianne Moore as the passenger sat next to Neeson and Downton Abbey's Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) as the chief stewardess. (In the early days of British Airways, some air-hostesses were Honourables - and even honourable!). A few corny elements - Neeson's grieving alcoholic back-story, Moore's mystery-woman, a cute little girl travelling alone - but mercifully no singing nun. The story has credibility-stretching twists, but the last half-hour is seriously nerve-shredding with special effects bringing to vivid reality every passenger's worst nightmare. Reviewing the original AIRPORT (1970), the great film critic Alexander Walker wrote: 'For sheer contentment there is nothing to beat the sight of constant catastrophe happening to others.' He was right!",8,1,3,26 March 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," The Pink Panther rides again!
","Wes Anderson serves up what might be called a 'romp-com' with this between-the-wars tale of the misadventures of Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes), concierge at a splendid spa hotel which manages to be located simultaneously in the Alps and Eastern Europe. Falsely accused of the murder of one of the hotel regulars (Tilda Swinton, made to look like a cross between Edna Everage and Miss Havisham), Gustave and his apprentice escape from prison and go on the run, aided by a 'mafia' of continental concierges.Gustave is more than somewhat reminiscent of Inspecteur Clouseau. Fiennes plays him with an appropriate klutziness that often pleasingly evokes the late great Peter Sellers. There are scenes which appear to pay homage to Stanley Kubrick (THE SHINING and EYES WIDE SHUT) and even Stanley Kramer (IT'S A MAD MAD MAD MAD WORLD). There's an Alpine chase which calls to mind several ski sequences from the Bond franchise. F. Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody and Willem Defoe give fruity supporting performances; Owen Wilson and Bill Murray are among the many stars who contribute walk-ons, presumably just for the kudos of being in a Wes Anderson movie.This is a monumentally daft and old-fashioned movie, sometimes hammy, sometimes hysterical. There are a few misfires; the story-within-a- story-within-a-story is clunky (providing roles for Jude Law and Tom Wilkinson); the use of Miniatures is painfully obvious. But the cast are clearly having a fine time, and it's easy to be carried along with the merriment and mischief.",7,3,15,12 March 2014
The Favourite," Queen Anne: gouty, doughty - and gay
","It's the early 1700s. England's war with France is not going well, and the Queen is playing with her rabbits. She has 17 rabbits, in memory of the 17 children she lost or miscarried. When she's not playing with rabbits, Queen Anne (Olivia Colman), gouty and doughty, is playing with her latest squeeze, Sarah Duchess of Marlborough (Rachel Weisz).Yes, dear fellow citizens of the realm, our sometime sovereign lady Queen Anne was a 'friend of Dusty' (long before Dusty). There is (Wikipedia) historical evidence (mostly letters) of a whole series of attachments to ladies of the court. In the movie Sarah's cousin Abigail (Emma Stone) inveigles her way into the palace and, surprisingly soon, into the Queen's bedchamber. The feud for Anne's affections has ramifications in Parliament as well as in the palace.There are some lesbian scenes here, plus a small amount of heterosexual sex in the movie - played for laughs - and a large amount of swearing, with liberal use of both F-word and C-word. The somewhat camp vulgarity and the brisk pace of the narrative will have reminded many in the audience of the CARRY_
-ON comedies. I was more reminded of THE MADFNESS OF KING GEORGE, Alan Bennett's royal Regency romp, which wore its lese-majesty with a similarly brazen air of triumph.The acting by the three female stars is nothing less than glorious. The male cast members are also outstanding in more ways than one. There are some weird camera angles which I found distracting and some of the music score is painful to hear, but this is another right-royal romp, tragi-comic with a bias towards comedy, not quite as enjoyable as Mr Bennett's, but a splendid visual feast.",8,2,3,3 January 2019
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Dazzling (and not just Tom Cruise's teeth!)
","Trying to stop a renegade plutocrat from launching World War Three is quite a hoary old plot, used in more than one James Bond movie and many rip-offs. But the sheer pace of this MISSION IMPOSSIBLE outing and its thrilling 'set-piece' action scenes give it the illusion of originality. The stunts on the outside of the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai are dizzying, and there's a splendidly choreographed fight scene in a state-of-the-art electronic car park. Fights, car-chases, a nail-biting climax: with all this - and Tom Cruise's dazzling smile - what's not to like? The lad seems to be enjoying himself hugely, and so did I!The last 007 enterprise, QUANTUM OF SOLACE was woeful. GHOST PROTOCOL seriously raises the bar on this kind of movie. Daniel Craig must look to his laurels next year in the new Bond caper.",8,3,9,30 December 2011
It Follows," Scary? Sent me to sleep!
","This got raves from the three pundits on BBCtv's Film Night last week. It gets the triple-yawn from me. A bunch of annoying US teenagers in one of those Haddonfield suburbs are stalked by a ghostly humanoid presence who/which is passed on through sexual intercourse. Make that four yawns.David Cronenberg took us down this road in his early gross-out SHIVERS (1975), as did Jonathan Glazer in ultra-weird UNDER THE SKIN two years ago. IT FOLLOWS seems to be paying homage to those atmospheric Japanese horrors of recent times, but it sent me to sleep - twice! About three make-you-jump moments - not enough - plus an extended swimming-pool scene which didn't work and an ending that made no sense.It does not follow",4,17,122,3 March 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Soulful but not suspenseful
","No monkey movie (sorry, Caesar!) is ever going to recapture the two sublime shocks in the Charlton Heston original: the first time he (and we) heard an ape speak, and the electrifying moment when he discovered what planet he was on. RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES has an uphill battle to dazzle us, just as the 2001 remake of the original did. Yes, the CGI is brilliant (and clearly the whizz-kids deserve most of the credit for the 'motion capture' technique), but there are quite a few scenes, especially during the Golden Gate sequence, when the apes do still look like men in monkey-suits, much as they did (and were) in 1968.Are we meant to think the Andy Serkis Caesar is the Roddy McDowell Caesar from the original series or an ancestor of his? Rome had many Caesars; and so may Hollywood if the box office justifies it! Since the infant chimp learns sign-language whilst still a toddler, we are not going to be too amazed if he acquires vocal skills. There goes surprise number one. Since we know what planet we're on, an alternative surprise number two needs to be scripted, and the ape rebellion is territory covered in several of the earlier movies. The end appears to rewrite the scenario that led to Charlton Heston learning what was written in the sand, so maybe we're meant to see this as a reinvention rather than as a prequel, like Daniel Craig's take on 007 in CASINO ROYALE.RISE OF ETC is fairly predictable and lacking in suspense. John Lithgow, as Franco's dad in the throes of Alzheimer's, gets more tender moments than Caesar does, although this is a much more emotional, even soulful chimp than we're used to. But, overall, this movie is another of the summer blockbuster 'duds'.",Null,0,1,18 August 2011
Legend," Two psychos for the price of one
","The key question: Is this version of the Kray brothers' story better than the 1990 version starring the Kemp brothers as the twins who ran one of London's mini-Mafias in the 1960s? The answer: Not really. It's very much a one-man tour-de-force from Tom Hardy playing both Reggie and Ronnie. Emily Browning gives a good account of herself as Frances, the East End girl who makes the mistake of falling in love with Reg. Tara Fitzgerald has a couple of good scenes as Frances's disapproving mother, but the role of the Kray boys' mum (Billie Whitelaw in overdrive in 1990 as a kind of British Ma Barker!) has almost vanished.The script focuses on Reg and Frances, with Reg constantly promising to give up his gangster life and always reneging on these promises. Ronnie, the gay psycho, hovers in the background with the slightly pantomime air of Anthony Hopkins's take on Hannibal Lecter. There's a clear divide between Hardy's two performances, although towards the end, when Reg commits the crime which sends him to jail for 33 years, he also seems psychotic - not the way the courts saw it.The 1990 film gave a better sense of their 'empire' developing. This screenplay seems to keep going over the same ground: the scenes between Reg and Frances, the tension between the brothers, brawls in pubs and nightclubs. My favourite scenes were those with John Sessions on fine form as Lord Boothby, the Tory peer with a weakness for rent boys supplied by Ronnie (I think Boothby was fictionalised in the 1990 version). LEGEND scores high points for evoking the atmosphere of the Sixties. In the annals of infamy the Kray brothers were minor villains, but this film, like the earlier one, reminds us that London's history has always included men like Reg and Ronnie who pander to the seedy vices of the not-so-great, the not-so-good.",6,1,2,21 September 2015
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Darkest picture of Hollywood since DAY OF THE LOCUST
","Once we learn that DiCaprio's neighbors in the Hollywood Hills are Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), the viewer has an uncomfortable feeling about where this story is going to end. Except that it doesn't - exactly. Tarantino has a few tricks up his sleeve. Doesn't he always?All Quentin's trademarks are here. Weird camera angles. Sudden short flashbacks. A loud score of pop hits. Non-stop profanity. Graphic violence, of course, even before the gory climax. There's an ever-present sense of homage to yesteryear Hollywood. At 2 hours 41 minutes the movie is a long haul, and your expectations of where it's going are a major element of the suspense. ONCE UPON A TIME is more coherent than PULP FICTION or KILL BILL. Solid performances from DiCaprio and Brad Pitt are the glue that holds it together. Bruce Lee and Steve McQueen are grafted a bit clumsily onto the screenplay, along with Tate And Polanski.This is the darkest study of Hollywood since John Schlesinger's DAY OF THE LOCUST (1975). It leaves a nasty taste, but I guess that's another Tarantino trademark.",8,7,19,15 August 2019
Behind The Candelabra," Carry on camping
","Wow! Camp overdrive. Camp overkill!You have to remember that Lee Liberace was the most flamboyantly gay entertainer showbiz has ever seen - even though he sued a British newspaper for hinting that he was a tad effeminate and went to his grave protesting his innocence from homosexuality.The part is a gift to an actor and Michael Douglas sinks his teeth into it with relish. He also sinks his teeth into Matt Damon (who wouldn't!) as Scott Thorsen, Lee's toyboy for six years who even underwent plastic surgery to make him look more like his new 'daddy'. Liberace was an egomaniac, vain, needy, voraciously sexual and vicious when he didn't get his own way. Thorsen (on whose biography the movie is based) tries to portray himself as both less and more than just a gold-digging opportunist. The screenplay suggests that this mismatched pair may - for a time anyway - have loved each other. Hell had no fury like Lee scorned and Thorsen, like his many predecessors, was moved on as briskly as he was moved in - and with a lot less in 'palimony' than he would get today; Liberace was outlandishly generous but he could also be stingy.All the kitsch of Mr Showmanship's life is here: the ludicrously furnished homes (Michael Jackson had the same hideous taste); the extravagantly costumed performances. His skill on the piano, however technically accomplished, always seemed like the keyboard equivalent of a drag show - every piece of music as over-decorated as his houses. Michael Douglas captures not just the style, but the very essence of this preening onstage/offstage monster; it seems unfair that because the movie has gone straight to cable TV in the US he will not be eligible for an Oscar.Matt Damon also clearly enjoys playing against his usual type and is very persuasive as a cocky young man enjoying the luxury of his new life but at the same time stifled by it. Rob Lowe goes gloriously camp as the plastic surgeon to the stars, with hair modelled on Lauren Bacall. Debbie Reynolds is unrecognisable in a cameo as Lee's money-grubbing momma - they should have built her part up more.This is the cruelest as well as the campest biopic since MOMMIE DEAREST. If this is director Steven Soderbergh's 'swansong', as he has promised, he's going out on a high. Everybody involved in this production pays pitch-perfect 'homage' to the over-the-top phenomenon that was Lee Liberace. Freddie Mercury and Elton John don't come close, though perhaps Quentin Crisp did. Liberace managed to be a gay version of both Frankenstein and the Creature!",8,1,5,13 June 2013
Gone Girl," The lady vanishes
","The main plot twist, which could only be a surprise to those who haven't read the book, is very predictable, but some of the later twists are neatly executed, although often credulity-stretching. The ending is nicely unpredictable and brings a pleasing sense of Just Desserts.Ben Affleck makes a good fist of Mr Nice-Guy who may not be such a nice guy, but the movie belongs to Ms Pike. Her threatened wife is definitely not from the school of Doris Day in MIDNIGHT LACE; the echoes are rather more of Glenn Close in FATAL ATTRACTION or JAGGED EDGE, two movies to which this film owes a hefty debt. The sex-and-violence quotient is fairly high, but I'm surprised the film didn't sneak below its 18 rating. Leavened with some humour, particularly targeting the media vultures who descend on the family house in outlandish numbers, this is at heart just a spiced-up version of the earlier screen melodramas (THE LADY VANISHES!!) which must have inspired the author. Hokum, quality hokum even, well scripted and stylishly directed, but not quite as 'classy' as WHAT LIES BENEATH, another of the movies that I found myself remembering while I sat through this.",8,3,11,11 October 2014
Insidious," Scary-ish movie
","I've waited a few weeks for my local multiplex (Brighton) to show a movie that wasn't aimed at pre-teens, and along comes INSIDIOUS, which pre-teens (who'll have to wait for the DVD) will probably enjoy more than I did, since it's about as scary as a good episode of DR WHO.INSIDIOUS is a mish-mash of ingredients: a bit of PARANORMAL ACTIVITY, a bit of AMITYVILLE HORROR, a bigger bit of THE EXORCIST and a whole lot of POLTERGEIST. The mixture is fairly well brewed with quite a few make-you-jump moments and adequate performances (though Barbara Hershey is wasted in a thin role and the lady medium reminded me more than somewhat of the late Queen Mum!). The lighting inside the two Haunted Houses is almost as dim before the weird stuff starts as after, and the glimpses of the 'Further' (the Afterlife has been re-branded) are a bit like the Ghost Train at a funfair, with things jumping out of near total darkness at the rider/viewer.It's a relief to have a horror flick that doesn't rely on gross-out gore, but this is only a scary-ish movie. It doesn't hold a (black) candle to Sam Raimi's DRAG ME TO HELL.",6,5,11,6 May 2011
The Theory of Everything," Perfectly poignant
","Eddie Redmayne is already winning awards. He ought to scoop the lot. The gawky kid who charmed us in MY WEEK WITH MARILYN is now the geeky cosmologist who wins the heart of a girl at college, enjoys a happy life with her and their children and conquers the scientific world with his theories about the birth of the universe even as Motor Neurone Disease takes away his mobility and his speech, but not - against all the odds - his dignity or his humour.Stephen Hawking is a scene-hogging role like Dustin Hoffman's in RAIN MAN, but Felicity Jones manages to steal some of his limelight much as Tom Cruise managed to steal from Dustin. Her Jane Hawking is believably impossibly perfect - the wife who lovingly supports her increasingly frail partner and then with exquisite discomfort falls in love with somebody else. There are no scenes of violence or vitriol: Stephen and Jane's love survives the collapse of their marriage. The supporting actors in this quiet drama are not big names, which lends their performances added conviction. A more poignant story would be hard to imagine: triumph and tragedy delicately brought to life. There is no air of contrivance in this movie. Poignant and flawless.",10,0,0,15 January 2015
A Quiet Place," The scary sound of silence
","A QUIET PLACE comes with echoes of WAR OF THE WORLDS and CGI aliens that look like hideous clones of Sigourney Weaver's intergalactic chums. After an invasion by people-chomping monsters a family of survivors try to find sanctuary in rural America: Emily Blunt and her real-life husband John Krasinski (who also directs) and their three kids. The aliens are blind but super-sensitive to sound, so the family learns to live as silently as possible, talking in sign-language and whispers. The perils of noise are brought vividly home from time to time: a battery-operated toy or a dropped plate brings terrible retribution. Emily is pregnant, so you wonder how she is going to give birth in silence and produce a noiseless infant. These questions are answered in nerve-shredding scenes in the second half of the film.Normally, when someone's phone goes off in a cinema, you make noises of disapproval and long to belt them. When this happened yesterday I almost hit the deck!A QUIET PLACE has the rustic unease of several of M. Night Shyamalan's movies. You think the countryside is safer than the city? Think again.",8,3,5,25 April 2018
Unknown," Bourne again
","There's not a lot one can say about this without giving away the plot surprises. It started out reminding me of other Hitchcock 'hommages' like FRANTIC or Liam Neeson's own TAKEN. The fact that Neeson's character here loses his memory in a near-drowning inevitably recalls THE BOURNE IDENTITY, and the parallels with the Bourne movies were soon coming thick and fast: urban car chases (good stunt work or CGI?), the girl (Diane Kruger) who saves our hero more than once, the treacherous people supposedly on Neeson's side. And Neeson's character develops along similar lines to Jason B.This is one of those films that you find yourself picking holes in as soon as you're out of the cinema. 'Why didn't he/she do/say that?' The answer tends to be: 'Because the movie would have only lasted 10/20/30 minutes.' So: pacey and twisting, yes. But also, contrived and derivative. Entertaining enough while you're watching it, but really no more 'meat content' than a Jean-Claude Van Damme vehicle. Not in the same class as the Bourne Trilogy: Matt Damon retains his title.",6,2,4,16 March 2011
Call Me by Your Name," Summer of gay love
","After years of famine this is feast year for gay picture-goers: two gay love stories in two months. Scripted by James Ivory and directed by Luca Guadagnino, CALL ME BY YOUR NAME has all the rich texture and subtlety of a 'classic' Merchant-Ivory production. It's 1983 and 17-year-old Elio Perlman (Timothee Chalamet) is spending the summer at his parents' house in Northern Italy. A hunky American graduate (Arnie Hammer) arrives to help his professor father with archaeological research. Elio develops a crush on the charismatic Oliver who, reluctantly at first, reciprocates. A summer of intense passion is bound to have a short lease as Oliver has to go back to the States.The two leads give deeply felt performances and the spirit of the 1980s – musically and morally – is delicately evoked. Elio's dad (Michael Stuhlbarg, a near double for Robin Williams), supportive and non-judgmental, is the dad any gay teenager would yearn to have.Cinematography and the music score are superb. At two and a quarter hours the movie is a tad too long and slow to take off, but the intensity of this love story exceeds GOD'S OWN COUNTRY and is very much the equal of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. The mood reminded me very much of Joseph Losey's THE GO-BETWEEN (1971). A movie not to be missed.",8,14,29,1 November 2017
Magic Mike XXL," Bump and grind - and not much else
","The first MAGIC MIKE movie had something (not much) to say about the economic pressures that might drive a young, generously-endowed man to find an alternative' career in the world of 'male entertainment'. This sequel doesn't bother with much motivation; unfortunately, it also doesn't bother with much plot. After shouty scenes between Mike and the other Kings of Tampa on the Bill and Ted-type road strip we get screamy scenes in Savannah at a kind of cathouse-for-ladies run by an old flame of Mike's (Jada Pinkett Smith). In the closest this film gets to the irony that was occasionally present in the first movie, the club's clients are mostly black women, brandishing fistfuls of dollars which they throw onto the dance floor rather than tucking them into trunks and thongs. Clearly Obama in the White House has done wonders for the empowerment - and enrichment - of black women. A similar scene ensues in the finale at Myrtle Beach - more shouting and screaming - when Mike and the Kings get to strut their routines at the strippers' convention.I'm probably not part of this movie's 'demographic', although I like to see buff gents in the buff as much as the next (gay) man. We seem to have come a long way from the Chippendales. The guys don't just strip and bump and grind, they now simulate sex acts on lucky (unlucky?) women from the audience. Like the whole movie, it's lewd and it's raunchy, but subtle it ain't.",4,7,15,12 July 2015
Hidden Figures," Race and the space race
","So soon after JACKIE we're back to the Kennedy era again, with this uplifting tale that puts a shaded meaning on the 'race' element of the Space Race. HIDDEN FIGURES – the title is a clever pun – is the story of three African-American women whose mathematical brilliance made a vital contribution to the effort to catch up with the Russians who'd rocketed the first man out of Earth's atmosphere.The women were called 'human computers' – we later see the installation of the clunky great IBM machine that would take over much of the laborious number-crunching these workers performed. The movie goes out of its way to show how tough black women's lives were in the workplace: 'colored' toilets, restricted prospects for advancement and constant daily humiliations from white co-workers (one of them is given her own coffee dispenser next to the one the white staff use). Writer/director Theodore Melfi shows us their home lives too, which are surprisingly similar to the lives of white folk. The number-crunching sequences are executed crisply enough not to overwhelm the audience with mathematics.The script perhaps slightly over-eggs the three women's vicissitudes to heighten the drama, but the three actresses (Taraji Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe) give rock-solid performances with very few moments of 'grandstanding'. Kevin Costner is similarly 'solid' as the head of the Space Research Division.This is another film, like last month's LION, that's bursting with the 'feel-good factor'. The feel-good factor is something HIDDEN FIGURES (if you'll excuse another very un-PC pun) delivers in spades.",8,1,6,22 February 2017
1917," Grueling two hours of trench warfare
","Brilliantly shot, mostly at waist level, and cunningly edited to give the impression of a real-time sequence, 1917, like Spielberg's WARHORSE in 2011, presents as authentic impression of trench warfare as we are likely to see. Not just barbed wire and bomb craters, the two lance corporals crawl over rotting human corpses and dead horses to get to the German lines. There are a couple of overdone sequences which trip the movie into Indiana Jones territory, but mostly you do feel that this really is how it must have been for our grandfathers and great-grandfathers.In the key roles Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay are totally 'right' for the story and the period. Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch and Andrew Scott are shoehorned into cameos. It's a tough two hours to sit through, almost as grueling as a Holocaust story, and it rams home the message that - extraordinary heroism and sheer endurance apart - there was nothing Great about the Great War.",8,1,3,23 January 2020
Lincoln," The importance of being earnest
","Much as he did in AMISTAD and SCHINDLER'S LIST, Steven Spielberg gives us a history lesson. This is an earnest film that requires serious concentration from the audience, given that it mostly consists of temperature-raising debate in Congress and arm-twisting meetings in the Lincoln White House. There are some scenes of the Civil War raging beyond Washington which are as visceral as the Normandy landings at the beginning of PRIVATE RYAN. Spielberg is equally brilliant at the broad canvas and the close portrait. The cinematography in Lincoln is almost painterly, like one of the Dutch masters: dimly lit rooms filled with dingily dressed people. I was reminded of the scenes inside Don Vito's house in the original GODFATHER.The movie belongs, as the shower of awards is proving, to Daniel Day- Lewis. This is the most convincing portrayal of a historical figure since Ben Kingsley's Gandhi. When Lincoln shouts a reminder that the role of President invests him with 'awesome powers', you feel that Day- Lewis himself is invested with awesome powers. His make-up is a tad overdone: there were moments when his beard and deeply furrowed brow gave him the look of a Klingon. As Thaddeus Stevens and Mary Todd Lincoln, Tommy Lee Jones and Sally Field give career-best performances. Costumes and sets give the whole movie the look of an authentic window into the past. If this is an accurate account of how the Thirteenth Amendment came to be passed, then the abolition of slavery was almost a fluke. We are only showed the House debate, not the Senate (which had already passed the amendment), but very few of the parliamentarians seem to have acted out of conscience or from principle; the waverers (of whom they were many) were won over by bullying or bribery (jobs for the boys).However narrowly the Thirteenth was passed, US democracy was stretched in 1865 to encompass all its citizens. This is a fine, a noble, movie about one of the key moments in America's history.",8,0,1,19 February 2013
The Imitation Game," Flawed genius, flawed movie
","This is not the first movie to investigate the Bletchley Park team that cracked the Nazi Enigma code and hastened Germany's defeat. This version puts a lot more meat on the bones of the code-breakers' story and, more importantly, gives mathematician Alan Turing the full credit for his role as creator of the Ultra machine that finally broke the code. We now know that Turing is part parent, part midwife, to today's PCs and iPads and Smartphones.We also know that Turing was a homosexual in an era when gays were prosecuted and cruelly punished, although the writer and director of THE IMITATION GAME seem to be unsure about how far to go in exploring this side of Turing's fatally (as it would prove) flawed genius. Flashbacks to his boarding school days show geeky Alan clumsily and inarticulately in love with a fellow pupil, but his great love in the Bletchley Park period is Joan (Keira Knightley), the only female on the team. Benedict Cumberbatch perfectly catches the adult Alan's equally clumsy courtship of Joan, whom he loves but does not desire. The moral dilemma the Bletchley Park team - and the government - faced once they had broken the German code is chillingly presented but the movie's fatal flaw, for me, was in declaring Turing's homosexuality (and its terrible consequences) but not exploring it in any depth. We see the postwar police doggedly building a case against him, but we get few clues as to the kind of gay man he was. Perhaps Benedict was OK about playing gay but didn't want to fully 'do' gay? What the Turing movie needed, I think, were a couple of the scenes like Gary Oldman had in PRICK UP YOUR EARS, candidly but not not too explicitly showing Joe Orton's naughty weakness for cottaging and rent boys. THE IMITATION GAME is a visual feast with well-judged performances from the entire cast, but it settles for being a Merchant Ivory-style period piece with (as the poster proclaims) more than one enigma at its centre. This is not the definitive biography of Alan Turing.",8,6,14,16 November 2014
Jurassic World," Back to the future past
","This cinematic funfair ride comes with a 12A certificate, though under- twelves will probably enjoy it more than older kids. Lots of jumpy moments but we are spared the more grisly stuff: people are snatched and killed but 'chew and splatter' is mostly kept off-screen. Once the two young brothers are trapped out in the park with the killing- machine monster, the rest of the plot (actually all of the plot) is very predictable - Claire and Owen rescuing the kids from a series of perils. Nevertheless, the sheer pace of the movie largely obliterates any sense of over-familiarity. And the CGI is - no other way to say it - simply 'awesome': the interaction between actors and creatures is seamless. This 'reboot' of the JURASSIC theme really is a thrill-a-minute - visually it's a thrill-a-second!",8,6,15,2 July 2015
Prisoners," Every parent's nightmare
","Director Denis Villeneuve sustains the tension for two-and-a-half nerve- racking hours. The music and the murky cinematography give this film a moody atmosphere that reminded me of THE GIFT (2000), the Southern Gothic melodrama starring Cate Blanchett and Keanu Reeves. All the cast of PRISONERS bring credibility to a storyline that has a few probability-stretching elements - a a slightly daft resolution - but the film belongs to Hugh Jackman: you feel all the pent-up rage of a man who will go to any lengths, cross any moral boundary, to try and bring his daughter home. With the Madeleine McCann abduction back in the news, PRISONERS has a special resonance for UK audiences, but this is the nightmare that every parent dreads waking up to.",7,0,0,17 October 2013
Silence," Challenging start to the year's movie-going
","My first movie of 2017 is a fairly challenging one – Martin Scorcese's 'treatise' on Faith and Apostasy in 17th-century Japan. Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver play two Portuguese priests who travel to the Orient to look for a missing predecessor (Liam Neeson) and to bring comfort and sacramental rites to Catholic converts who are being persecuted and tortured by Samurai inquisitors.Interesting to discover that Buddhism, which most of us think of as a pacifist, contemplative religion, has a history as dark and violent as that of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The silence at the heart of the movie is the silence of God: does He hear the prayers of the persecuted; and does He mind if people stamp on an image of Christ to save their lives?Apart from the harrowing scenes of torture and brutal execution, much of the film is shot in darkened rooms and daytime fogs. There are many long scenes – too many, too long – of dialogue between Garfield and the Inquisitor. There are a couple of clunky moments which attempt to echo Christ's Passion, and a Japanese 'Judas' pops into the story a little too often. Garfield gives a performance that reminded me of Montgomery Clift – that sense of tension waiting to be uncoiled. Driver's role is more physical, more heroic, less subtle. Liam Neeson relies too much on the gravitas of his presence. The last chapter in the story undermines much of the film's intensity and the final frame feels like something added as a 'sop' to today's evangelists.Inevitably you find yourself comparing SILENCE to Roland Joffe's 1986 epic THE MISSION. Scorcese's movie arguably has more depth and definitely more debate, but THE MISSION had a 'magnificence' which SILENCE has less of – and Joffe's movie had that resonating Morricone score. SILENCE deserves points for nobility of purpose and Mr Scorcese is clearly a man of huge integrity,",7,1,6,7 January 2017
Logan," Wolverine and Mini-Me
","This is Hugh Jackman's widely announced 'swansong' as Wolverine/Logan, the mutant with adamantine knives in his knuckles. As the movie opens, he seems more mortal than super-hero, care-worn, drinking too much, driving a stretch limo near the Mexican border to pay for the meds desperately needed by ailing Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart). A young girl, Laura, arrives in their lives, pursued by mutant- hunters: she's a Mini-Me version of Wolverine, possessed of similar talons and talents. Logan gets his 'mojo' back and he and Laura fight off the first wave of hunters. But there are more where they came from, directed by a Frankensteinian doctor (Richard E. Grant) in whose lab the girl was created, along with a Terminator version of Wolverine. The rest of the movie is chase and run, fight and run – pretty much the standard fare of the X-MEN franchise. The fight scenes, of which there are many, are fairly visceral with now four sets of blades chopping up the baddies.The world-weariness and a certain elegiac quality raise this above the mainstream of Marvel adaptations. Jackman and Stewart, two very charismatic players, give more nuanced performances than the genre normally allows. Stephen Merchant makes his mark in a cameo as a kind of super-albino. We may see more of Laura (Dafne Keen) if she takes over Logan's role in the next X-MEN instalment: will she be 'Wolverina'? And will there be another Final Chapter to usher Magneto into the Twilight Home?",8,0,3,24 March 2017
Everest," Top of the world, Ma!
","Docudrama climbs new heights - in fact, to the summit of the world's highest mountain - in this adrenaline-intensive re-creation of the tragic climbing season of May 1996 when eight people died in a two-day blizzard on Everest. Although there are big-name stars here (Jake Gyllenhaal, Sam Worthington, Keira Knightley), no one is allowed to grandstand: what counts is the ascent. The script gives us glimpses of the climbers' everyday lives - the wives holding their breath at home - and the support team at the various Camps; and, never forget, the Sherpas. But the movie's biggest star is the mountain - and, it must be said, the cameramen who surely took serious risks to obtain the footage.The CGI people have seamlessly joined scenes shot in the Italian Alps to the Everest shoot. You totally feel (especially if you see it in 3D and IMAX) that you are up there with these people crawling across bottomless crevasses and dizzying slopes. You also get a sense of what drives these mountaineers, a force somewhere between bravery and foolhardiness, to take on one of the greatest challenges our planet has to offer.",8,0,0,28 September 2015
Elysium," Movie with a mission-statement
","ELYSIUM's slimline plot springs few surprises. I liked the contrast between the space-station's cure-all tanning pods and Earth's still overstretched hospitals. It's clear that the $100,000,000 budget mostly went on CGI. The effects are great if not exactly fresh. The cast do the best they can with under-scripted characters. Matt Damon recycles Jason Bourne to good effect. Jodie Foster phones in her role as a Elysium's answer to Donald Romfeld. Sharlto Copley does a Johnny Depp panto turn as Jodie's arch henchman Kruger. Pretending that a South African township is the San Diego of tomorrow doesn't entirely come off, and Elysium itself is somewhat insubstantial: I was reminded of the threatened enclave in TV's THE WALKING DEAD. But - hey - maybe this is where our great-grandchildren are headed. Like Blomkamp's 2009 sci-fi thriller DISTRICT 9, ELYSIUM is a movie with a heavy-handed mission statement: share your toys, boys and girls!",7,1,3,23 August 2013
The Artist," More sound, please!
","I hate to be a party-pooper but for me this is not the greatest movie of recent times. Yes, it's charming, even beguiling - and it's got the most appealing dog in cinema history! - but it's kind of slow and kind of, dare I say, not very original. One man's 'hommage' is another man's piracy: SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, A STAR IS BORN and SUNSET BOULEVARD are a bit too strongly 'tributed'. Berenice Bejo's Peppy has an androgynous quality that reminded me of Jack Lemmon's Daphne in SOME LIKE IT HOT!The scene where George has a nightmare with actual sound is surprisingly disturbing, and it's easy to guess there will be another sound scene towards the end. For me the lack of dialogue - and the period Muzakal score - became more than a bit monotonous. It might have worked better if George's scenes had been the only silent ones, with Peppy's and the studio scenes having sound.The acting - with its 'hammy' evocation of the silent era - is brilliant, as is the direction and the cinematography. Uggie the tricksy Jack Russell is so cute you want to take him home with you - but I wish I liked the film more.",7,3,9,21 January 2012
La La Land," Zings ain't what they used to be
","After rave reviews and the Golden Globes there's now an Oscar/Bafta buzz attached to LA :LA LAND. Sorry to rain on the big parade but I was not blown away. Yes, there's some charm here with all the homage to the Golden Age of romantic musicals, and Ryan Gosling remains the most charismatic of today's young stars, but the music simply isn't musical enough. Gosling and Emma Stone can just about carry a song and do a bit of amateur hoofing, but really the singing is nearly as ragged as it was in the screen version of LES MISERABLES and the dancing is about as far from Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly as the first round of 'Dancing With the Stars'.OK, Kelly and Astaire (and Ginger Rogers and other co-stars of theirs) did not have great singing voices, but they were fantastic dancers and the song-and-dance numbers in their movies were never less than dazzling. The closest LA LA LAND comes to dazzling is in the final routine, a low-rent tribute to AN American IN Paris, but it just doesn't have enough dazzle. As musicals go, fings ain't what they used to be. The jazz club scenes hit the only high spots. Gosling really looks as if he's creating magic on the piano, but there's no magic in his singing or his dancing – nor in Stone's, who alas doesn't have her co-star's redeeming charisma. The love-story has a certain amount of charm but, like the music, it could do with a bit more 'zing'.The Golden Age nostalgia also extends to a clunky tribute to REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE. But nostalgia just isn't enough and there's too much clunkiness on display here. They say there isn't the money to create great musicals like we had in MGM's heyday. Surely it would take only a fraction of the budget for a CGI-heavy action movie or space opera to hire some first-rate dancers and singers who can act - or, if we must, actors who can sing (or mime to a better singer)? SINGIN' IN THE RAIN cannot have been a big-budget production, but it's still the greatest of the greats.",6,14,23,20 January 2017
Super 8," Thrilling 'hommage' to Spielberg/Alien/Lost
","I seem to have watched a different movie from everybody else on this site - or maybe I approached it with a more 'popcorn-picture' mindset? For me SUPER 8 looks like being the best of this summer's blockbusters. It begins with a more spectacular train-crash than the one in THE FUGITIVE and ends with a space-craft that is wonderfully silly but as thrilling, in its way, as the one in CLOSE ENCOUNTERS. In between we get a group of charming young teens who help the police and the military deal with a mysterious 'creature' that escaped the wrecked train.The marauder is unmasked a bit at a time, which builds up the suspense in this well-paced story with its characters that are believably fleshed-out and well played. There's a bit of 'hommage' to director J.J. Abrams LOST series on TV and a bit more to the ALIEN series, but there are also some E.T. moments to dilute the scariness factor. Spielberg co-produced SUPER 8 and his influence pervades the movie. I loved it. The rest of you are simply wrong!",Null,0,0,15 August 2011
Sinister," Wow - a film about paranormal activity!
","From the producer of PARANORMAL ACTIVITY a film about - wait for it - paranormal activity. Ethan Hawke plays true-crime writer Ellison who moves his family into a house where a gruesome murder/abduction took place. His son sleepwalks, his daughter paints gory murals, his wife loses her temper. Ellison uncovers a link to other 'homes of horror' in different parts of the country.Not a lot that's new here. Themes from Stephen King and lots of Haunted House movies are shaken and stirred into the pot. There are some good make-you-jump moments, but the audience is allowed to see some manifestations that Ellison misses. Perhaps we were meant to shout out, 'It's behind you!' as if this was a Christmas panto.The mumbo-jumbo that unravels the mystery is dafter than usual. The ending was mildly shocking but not as good as CARRIE's postscript.",6,4,8,17 October 2012
Woman in Gold," Art and artifice
","The title suggests this is going to be a 'Woman's Picture' - and it is. But a high-quality woman's picture. And an uplifting true-life story.Maria Altmann is feisty and tetchy and magnificently determined. Mirren plays her in a slight twist on her portrayal of Elizabeth II, with a piled-on Austrian accent (no jokes about the Queen's Teutonic pedigree, if you please); I found myself wondering if Meryl Streep had been approached for the role, accents being very much her thing. Reynolds does a nice turn as the nerdy but equally resolute lawyer, the kind of role Gregory Peck made his name in. The movie has a sort of 'sheen' to it, which occasionally makes it seem a tad schmaltzy, and the flashbacks to the gilded glamour of pre-war Vienna are definitely over-polished. As in George Clooney's THE MONUMENTS MEN, the theft of paintings is almost allowed to eclipse the true horrors of what the Nazis did to Europe's Jews. The intransigence of today's Austrian art custodians - and its legal system - provides a neatly different chill. The scenes I liked most were those (three of them) in which past and present are allowed to meld together. This device was briefly and subtly used in the Merchant-Ivory HEAT AND DUST (1983). It's less subtly employed here, but it helps to make the film memorable. WOMAN IN GOLD is a beguiling work of art and artifice, handsomely framed.",8,10,17,13 April 2015
Jack Reacher," Ethan Hunt recycled
","Fans of Lee Childs's long-running thriller series went into a hissy fit when vertically-challenged brunette Tom Cruise was cast as six-foot-plus blonde super-hunk Jack Reacher, but - hold your horses, guys! - little Tommy does a decent enough job of 'morphing' - one could even say recycling - his Ethan Hunt persona into Jack Reacher.Reacher is a kind of freelance vigilante called in by hotshot lawyer Rosamund Pike whose client is the fall-guy for a 'spree' shooting in Pittsburgh. Reacher quickly carves a swathe through assorted thugs and corrupt cops. The tone of the film is oddly low-key, but writer/director Christopher McQuarrie shoehorns in a series of violent fights, car chases and shoot-outs which add a jerky momentum to the movie.There's no chemistry between Pike and Cruise (to be fair, the plot doesn't call for any), and the bad guys have been recruited from Rent-a- Thug with Werner Herzog slipped in as their leader without any motivation that I could fathom. Robert Duvall almost steals the movie in a cameo role as a shooting-range owner. The lack of back story to both Reacher and the villains leaves a gaping hole in the plot. Ultimately, like the MISSIONS IMPOSSIBLE, this is simply a vehicle for Tom Cruise. Luckily for us, he seems to have a bottomless supply of on screen charisma which allows him to slip into a role that is more than a little reminiscent of Clint Eastwood's nameless avenger in those early spaghetti Westerns.If there are to be sequels (Lee Child has written more Reacher novels than Fleming original Bond stories), Jack Reacher will need to have some flesh added to his well-toned bones. This is better than some of the weaker 007 movies but it is nowhere near as edgy and suspenseful as any of the Bourne franchise.",7,4,10,29 December 2012
Les Misérables," The girls out-sing the guys
","It's big and it's loud and it's (very) long. The sets, locations and costumes are stunning, capturing vividly the squalor of revolutionary Paris (and that's before the scene in the sewers): full marks to the designer as well as the director and cinematographer. The acting is of a very high order indeed.But. It's a big but. This is a musical - and the singing is not of a very high order. Russell Crowe wasn't as bad as I expected: he reminded me of Richard Harris as King Arthur in CAMELOT, croaking along in a way that was not too far from melodious. Hugh Jackman wasn't as good as I expected, given that he's sung in stage musicals. His big number, 'Bring Him Home' (one of the stage show's show-stoppers), didn't have the emotional impact of Colm Wilkinson's original in the theatre (Jackman sings it in high tenor rather than boy soprano). Anne Hathaway's rendition of Fantine's 'The Dream I Dreamed' finally displaces Susan Boyle's as a re-definition of the song; it is literally heart-breaking and is the movie's musical high point. Samantha Barks also delivers a touching version of Eponine's 'On My Own' , but I seriously disliked Amanda Seyfried as Cosette: her voice had a vibrato more suited to Handel or a Jessie Matthews tribute show.Eddie Redmayne was pretty good as Marius and has a pleasing singing voice, although perhaps the 'romantic lead' called for someone a bit more lyrical. Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen had their roles as the comic-relief Thenardiers pruned; their 'high society' scene at the end was cruelly truncated. The ensemble pieces ('One Day More' etc) were, if anything, even more powerful than on the stage. Gavroche (Daniel Huttlestone) sung as if he was in OLIVER, which is how the role should be sung!The director's decision to have most of the dialogue sung rather than spoken was a brave one and doesn't entirely work - although this is how the stage version, like EVITA, is performed. Both Crowe and Jackman often sound very flat in these 'recitative' passages and it is here that the movie loses pace. The spectacle and the narrative sweep of LES MISERABLES are fully captured, but the pathos of the stage show (a lot of characters are killed off) is slightly diminished, just as happened with Spielberg's film of WAR HORSE. Perhaps because LES MIS is more opera than musical, it needs the 'intimacy' of a theatre for its magic to work completely: operas do not generally translate to cinema unless they are filmed stage productions. Nevertheless, the cast here as well as the director have taken a brave stand at the barricades. At the end of the day ('you're another day older') it is a lot more entertaining - and better box-office - to have actors struggling to sing than singers struggling to act.",8,1,2,1 February 2013
The Shape of Water," Enchanting but daft!
","Back in the 1950s we used to see sci-fi movies like THE QATERMASS EXPERIMENT and I MARRIED A MONSTER FROM OUTER SPACE, shot on desperately low budgets but satisfyingly scary for their time - more than a little daft. THE SHAPE OF WASTER is a 'throwback' to that eraGuillermo del Toro is not new to 'creature features' or, as he would prefer to call them, fairy tales for adults. There are some very adult scenes in this movie - a pity in a way since it excludes the younger audience who would be enchanted by it. The theme is not too far removed from Spielberg's E.T. or CLOSE ENCOUNTERS with Elisa replacing the children captivated (captured, even) by aliens. Michael Shannon's brutal facility chief is the equivalent of the Nazi bounty-hunters in an Indiana Jones adventure. There's also a good-guy professor, and Sally Hawkins has a sassy sidekick in fellow cleaning-lady Olivia Spencer.For all the wondrous CGI and make-up, the Creature is still visibly an actor (Doug Jones) wrapped in plastic. The budget was clearly awesome. I'm not sure that it really deserves to be getting all these Awards and Nominations. I couldn't help remembering all those 1950s sci-fi horrors. Yes, it's a beguiling fantasy romance but it's also totally - epically - daft.",8,26,50,22 February 2018
Zero Dark Thirty," Documentary flavour - deserves to win awards
","Considering we already know how this story will end, it's amazing how suspenseful Kathryn Bigelow makes it. The assault by US Navy SEALs on the bin Laden compound in the final half-hour is nerve-shredding. This scene - indeed, most of the movie - is shot like a documentary; you feel as if you are eavesdropping on the CIA in 'real time'. None of the characters is given a back story: we are only interested in their role in the war against al-Qaeda.Apart from some off-duty drinking with her colleagues we only ever see Maya sitting in uncomfortably on interrogations or doggedly sifting through photos and intelligence snippets. But Jessica Chastain is as every bit as mesmerising as Claire Danes in HOMELAND without any of Carrie Matthison's emotional and psychiatric baggage. Chastain - and Bigelow - definitely deserve the awards they've been nominated for.A few familiar faces from both sides of the Atlantic turn up in supporting roles. Jennifer Ehle is excellent as one of Maya's colleagues. James Gandolfini (looking like J. Edgar Hoover) plays the CIA Director with a PA played by Britain's TV favourite John Barrowman.2013 has got off to a strong start, cinematically speaking. ZERO DARK THIRTY is the pick of the bunch so far.",8,1,4,8 February 2013
12 Years a Slave," Brutal and harrowing, but ----
","Steve McQueen spares the audience no detail of the appalling brutality of the plantation owners. Michael Fassbender's flogging of the slave he's been regularly raping (Lupita Nyong'o) is as savage as anything Mel Gibson has put on screen, and Paul Dano's psychopathic overseer is almost more disturbing than Fassbender. Chiwetel Ejiofor's solid performance as Solomon anchors the film, but compared to Spielberg's epic AMISTAD and more recently Tarantino's vivid DJANGO UNCHAINED, there isn't a great deal of story here. At the end we're told what happened to Solomon, but the fate of his fellow slaves, like poor pathetic Patsey, is left for us to conjecture. 12 YEARS A SLAVE is a harrowing 19th-century prison drama (OK, a false imprisonment drama) but it doesn't actually add anything to our knowledge of the inhuman evil that was slavery (and still is in parts of the world we're not encouraged to mention).",7,0,2,2 February 2014
Joker," Over the top - and then some
","This movie reminded me of Kubrick's version of Stephen King's THE SHINING. It has the same sense of darkness enveloping the characters. But, like Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), Arthur Fleck is manic - a maniac, really - from the start. The violence escalates (and how - I can't believe this movie got away with a 15 rating), but there's no real explanation of what made Arthur the way he is. Thanks to all the other movies in the Batman franchise, we know where the Joker is headed, but we need an 'origins' prequel to this one.Robert de Niro, playing a talk-show host, brings a reminder of dark roles he has vividly brought to life. But Joaquin Phoenix's performance, like Heath Ledger's in 2008, is a tour-de-force: over the top, and then some.A deeply disturbing movie. And worryingly likely to be seen as celebrating violence.",8,3,4,23 October 2019
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," The Guernsey best exotic film title
","The story is a slight and sentimental one. Despite war and death, this is another feel-good movie, much like FINDING YOUR FEET a few months back and with a similar 'ensemble' cast. Lily James just may be the new Julie Andrews, always a joy to see. Michiel Huisman, who plays the farmer, is a new name to me (I haven't watched Game of Thrones), but he contributes a handsome central presence that reminded me of Alan Bates's Farmer Gabriel in the 1967 FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD. Tom Courtenay is solid as always. Penelope Wilton is outstanding as the widow drowning in the grief of two world wars.Slight and sentimental, yes, but very involving. I so wanted this movie to have a happy-ever-after Mills & Boon-style ending. Does it? Go and find out.",9,5,10,1 May 2018
Inception," Think I've failed my A-Level Filmgoing
","Is it just me, or was this unintelligible? Not just 'hacking' into someone's dreams but manipulating their thoughts inside Dreamworld. And then, to add to the confusion, we had dreams within dreams within dreams! If the complex plot had an internal logic which appeared not to defeat Leonardo DiCaprio - it certainly defeated me. There is considerable homage to the MATRIX films, with aerial fights and frozen motion sequences: kid's stuff, but what do kids make of the anarchic storyline? If you die in someone else's dream, you can either wake up alive or go to a place called Limbo (not the same as the one Dante envisaged) which looked like the flooded New York of The Day After Tomorrow a few decades on. The plus side of Limbo for Leo was that it reunited him with his dead wife (Marion Cotillard), but was this his limbo or hers? Best not to ask.If MEMENTO, with time running backwards, was Christopher Nolan's 'set text' for Filmgoing GCSE, I guess INCEPTION represents A-Level movie comprehension.And I seem to have failed.",4,8,12,5 August 2010
Murder on the Orient Express," Better than 1974. Yes it is.
","This is the greatest whodunit of all time, and the 1974 movie - directed by Sidney Lumet, script by Paul Dehn - did it full justice. Albert Finney's Hercule Poirot made Peter Ustinov's previous performances seem lightweight (and surely inspired David Suchet's approach in the TV adaptations). Could it be bettered?Yes, it could. This version, scripted by Michael Green and directed by Kenneth Branagh, is gorgeously lavish, with stunningly digitalised locations and a train with more glamour than the Chrysler building. And a fairly lavish cast, including Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Penelope Cruz and Johnny Depp. Branagh himself plays Poirot; his usual half-Hitler moustache has grown to coat-hanger proportions but the accent is the one we're used to. The previous murder of little Daisy Armstrong remains the bedrock of the mystery, although this is dripped into the story in fragments. There's a new prologue, with Poirot solving a theft beside the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem (digitally inserted into a Malta backdrop), and the unravelling of the threads is more dramatically paced than it was in 1974.Some of the cast, now as then, are short-changed (Derek Jacobi and Olivia Colman don't get a lot to say). Michelle Pfeiffer has the meatiest part and is superb. Wendy Hiller had recently played Queen Mary in 1974 and invested the ancient Russian princess with all of Mary's Teutonic imperiousness. Judi Dench recycles her Queen Victoria to similar effect here.It sort of spoils it that most of us know how it's going to end – it would be a heresy against Agatha Christie to change the final scene (staged here with a slight nod to Da Vinci's Last Supper!) – but it only spoils it a tad. I envy those who see it without knowing whodunit. There's a teaser for DEATH ON THE NILE at the end. I can hardly wait.",9,3,11,16 November 2017
Arrival," Intelligent life - in the cinema!
","A sci-fi movie that assumes there is intelligent life in the cinema is something of a rarity. ARRIVAL reworks themes from other movies - notably 2001 and CONTACT - but it reworks them with a fresh perspective that makes this movie seem intriguing and original.Shell-shaped spacecraft arrive at various locations around the globe. The US one hovers over a field in Montana which quickly becomes a military zone like Area 51. Linguistics expert Amy Adams is summoned to try to communicate with the octopus-shaped aliens who squirt their words onto a clear wall that separates them from the scientists and their military escorts whom they allow inside the craft.The big question, of course, which occupies the entire movie, is: Have they come in peace? With (fond!) memories of MARS ATTACKS and WAR OF THE WORLDS, I was constantly anticipating mayhem. In the Pentagon (clearly not presided over by a Bush or a Trump) the doves, for once, are not silenced, but around the world the hawks squawk the loudest, inevitably.The CGI here manages to be stunning without being over-the-top. Adams gives a nicely judged performance which justifiably dominates the movie. The story lacks pace but it delivers on thought-provoking content. Probably, as in 2001 and CONTACT, most of the audience will come out wondering, What the hell was that all about? Good: get 'em thinking. Treat us as intelligent beings - like the tentacle people!",8,1,6,18 November 2016
Parasite," Not my Movie of the Year
","Of the films in contention this year, I think I would have given Best Director and Best Picture awards to Quentin Tarantino and ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD - a sly 'revisionist' take on Tinseltown at the far end of its Golden Age. I can see that PARASITE is highly original and filled with ironical social commentary, but Best Picture? Nah.It's hard to write about it without spoilers, but it's a tale of two Korean families, one rich and living in a hilltop mansion, the other struggling in a grimy basement below the bottom of the same hill. Crafty as well as envious, the poor people slowly (a bit too slowly, IMO) infiltrate the lives of the rich folk. When the plutocrats take off for a camping trip, things start to unravel.The theme of the working class subverting the Upper Crust was brilliantly explored in Joseph Losey's THE SERVANT (1963), which did not morph from Social Drama into Horror territory. I think PARASITE has to be judged as a horror movie, since that's where it ends up. Set against the standards of Class-A horrors like PSYCHO and THE EXORCIST, I would not put PARASITE in their league. Good, yes, and clever, beautifully shot and edited (and acted), but not up there with The Best. Sorry!",7,1,5,20 February 2020
The Big Short," Toxic debt makes a fun movie!
","The collapse of the US housing market (and Lehmans) in 2008, which precipitated the global financial crisis, doesn't sound like a recipe for fun and entertainment, does it? Neither did Zuckerman and Steve Jobs, but once again the secret is in the script and the acting. The writers have created a pacey run of short scenes with humour as well as tension, charting the escalating stupidity of the banks and finance companies who gave mortgages to people with zero credit rating and then wrapped these 'toxic' debts into packages for selling on to investors around the globe (including pension funds, city councils and national banks). One scene shows us a stripper with double mortgages on five properties: how could she not fail?My usual cavil: the f-words come at you like a hail of bullets. But all the actors - not just the four leads - give finely overwrought performances as the crisis builds to a peak and then unravels. A nice touch is to have cast members occasionally turn to address the camera in the new 'tradition' of HOUSE OF CARDS, making this a kind of satirical docudrama. But THE BIG SHORT is based on real people and painfully real events. Millions of people lost homes, jobs and even their lives when the mighty boom turned to an almighty bust.",8,0,1,29 January 2016
The Conjuring," Better than AMITYVILLE, not up there with THE EXORCIST
","Based, the credits tell us, on a true story, the unhappy house-buying experience of the Perron family in Rhode Island is played as a serious docudrama, not as a piece of hokum, which helps to give the movie some credulity. The two female leads are particularly solid: Lili Taylor as the mother fighting to save her children and Vera Farmiga as the ghost-buster with special 'gifts'. The make-you-jump moments do what they're supposed to and look more like old-fashioned special effects than over-egged CGI.There's nothing like an old-fashioned haunted-house movie. PARANORMAL ACTIVITY has decided to become another cheesy franchise. THE CONJURING is a cut above THE AMITYVILLE HORROR or the crappy 1999 remake of THE HAUNTING, but no movie is ever going to out-gross (in either sense of the word) THE EXORCIST.",7,1,3,14 August 2013
Prometheus," RIPLEY: the missing ingredient!
","This is my most anticipated movie of the summer and it's quite a disappointment. Remember how the original ALIEN made you jump? And not just when the creature popped out of John Hurt. Well, this film has very few make-you-jump moments, even though there is an 'alien-birthing' scene - and another one, closer to the John Hurt moment, near the end. There are a number of 'awesome' moments, including another skeleton-like giant spaceship (we even get to see it fly) and some fantastic 3D holograms, but - and it's a big but - where this film falls down is in the pace and the plotting.The film is co-written by Damon Lindelof, one of the co-creators and senior writers on the TV series Lost. Like the TV series, PROMETHEUS frequently feels as if the cast are 'winging' it, working with a plot that's being made up as they go along. The first three ALIEN pictures all had very tight scripts and sustained tension. PROMETHEUS has a very messy script and very little tension. Director Ridley Scott has lost the magic touch he brought to the original ALIEN and to BLADE RUNNER.The key character is biologist Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) who proves very resourceful and survives things no woman should have to go through, but she sadly lacks the bravura presence that Sigourney Weaver brought to the original quartet of films.Weren't we promised a prequel that would take us to the home planet of the Alien monsters? The finale of PROMETHEUS renews that promise, but whoever directs volume six will need to bring back the original writers. And maybe - bring back Ripley. She is very much the missing ingredient that robs this film of its full 'flavor'.",6,0,3,6 June 2012
The Water Diviner," Revisiting Gallipoli
","There's a lot to like about this movie. It has grand themes: Love, Loss, War and Peace. The locations are vivid, the pace is good, the performances un-showy and believable. The farmer's quest for his lost sons is interrupted with short but powerful flashbacks to the gruesome horrors of the battle. The quest has a predictable outcome and introduces a clumsy suspense element into the human story. You also kind of know how how the charming if slightly awkward love-story will end, although, in fact, the climax of this particular story is perfectly handled. This is a touching, almost noble picture, well put together by Mr Crowe in his directorial debut. But somehow there's a vital element missing: it doesn't feel tragic enough. The epic themes have been diluted to make THE WATER DIVINER a crowd-pleasing pot-boiler.",8,6,15,7 April 2015
The Woman in Black," The ghost of Harry Potter
","Susan Hill's Henry Jamesian ghost story gets a bigger make-over than the stage version. The premise is more or less the same: young solicitor's clerk arrives in deserted house to sort out papers of deceased owner. Cue spooky goings on involving a dead child and its dead but restless mother.An audience weaned on the SAW series and PARANORMAL ACTIVITY was never going to settle for mild disturbances in the manner of The Turn of the Screw, so after a few scenes of frightened villagers lifted from any Hammer horror you care to mention we soon start to see dead people. A serious flaw in the direction allows the audience to glimpse ghostly reflections and manifestations in a rocking chair before Arthur does and before the CGI is cranked into overdrive. Helped by local landowner (Ciaran Hinds - with a full-on mad-with-grief wife who almost belongs in a Carry-on), Arthur thinks he knows how to placate the Woman in Black. But does he? ... Cue (loud) threatening music.The 'ghost' that really hangs over this movie is Harry Potter; the wiz-kid is going to take longer to get past than an incarnation of James Bond. Daniel Radcliffe tries hard to climb this mountain but he is not yet (will he ever be?) an actor of substance and here, as in the HP series, the special effects overwhelm the cast. There are a few make-you-jump moments in THE WOMAN IN BLACK and the marshy setting is a pleasing throwback to Roger Corman's Edgar Allan Poe adaptations, but this movie will not enjoy the shelf-life of Jack Clayton's THE INNOCENTS or Robert Wise's THE HAUNTING, two early Sixties spine-tinglers that are still tingly 50 years later.",6,0,1,22 February 2012
X-Men: First Class," Souped-up same-old
","Sorry, folks, to be the party-pooper, but I thought this was just another comic-strip movie with brilliant CGI and better-than-usual performances. It was easy to feel that McAvoy and Fassbender would physically 'grow up' to be Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart, BUT the transition from headstrong good-guy Erik to super-baddie Magneto seemed to come from nowhere. Kevin Bacon's villain was from the school of Blofeld and I liked the notion that Mutants played a key role in the 1962 Cuban Crisis (although it somewhat detracts from the brinkmanship skills of John F. Kennedy!). This is only a prequel in the sense that we saw the Mutants honing and controlling their 'gifts' before pitching them against Kevin Bacon's Doctor Doom in routines that we have seen too often in Marvel comics and movies. Reminding us that Superheroes are just as insecure as the rest of us has also been done before, more successfully with Batman and Superman than with the over-angsty Spiderman. The 'conversion' of Erik and Raven into Magneto and Mystique was little more than a postscript to link back to the Trilogy. Otherwise this was quite a lot of souped-up same-old. The blockbuster I'm really looking forward to this summer is Cowboys and Aliens. I also hope the Alien prequel will do a better job than X-Man: First Class; the Alien movies set a very high standard.",7,1,4,17 June 2011
Fifty Shades of Grey," More M&S than S&M
","One must try - and inevitably fail - not to adopt a patronising tone when reviewing FIFTY SHADES The novel, whose literary merit is neither here nor there (and certainly not there) - launched a new genre of its own - Porno Lite - and so, I fear, will the movie. I'm pretty sure bondage involves more than a few smacks on the bum and lots of kissing, which seems to be about as far as an 18 rating allowed Sam Taylor-Johnson to go.The movie's fatal flaw is the lack of chemistry between the two leads. They are acting out an attraction they clearly do not feel. Dakota Johnson tries to play it feisty and vulnerable but comes over as a bit bland. Jamie Dornan, who was glamorous and creepy as the serial killer tracked down by Gillian Anderson in THE FALL on BBCtv, is not glamorous enough here - and rather deficient in creepiness. Apart from his under- used dungeon playroom, even the furnishings in his billionaire bachelor pad (and his suits) look as if they came from the high street rather than high-end designers. The whole movie is - sorry about this - more M&S than S&M.If there is to be a screen sequel - FIFTY SHADES DARKER - I wonder, without much enthusiasm, if some of the contraptions briefly glimpsed in Christian's chamber of horrors will be brought into play. How far can the line between porno and mainstream be blurred? It was much more stylishly crossed in 9 1/2 WEEKS.",5,4,7,7 March 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," Best superhero movie since ..... SUPERMAN 2
","Not having bothered to see the new SPIDERMAN, I wasn't going to take in the latest instalment of BATMAN. I'm glad I changed my mind. This is the best superhero movie since - how far back do I go? - since SUPERMAN 2? Christopher Nolan brings his trilogy to a triumphant conclusion.Stunning CGI, great lighting (great darkness!), a creepy villain (Tom Hardy's Bane looks like something from HELLRAISER or an ALIEN crossbreed ) and a strong storyline bring this movie up to the level of TERMINATOR 2 or TOTAL RECALL (total remake coming soon to a cinema near you!). None of the familiar faces - Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Matthew Modine, even Liam Neeson (back like the ghost of Hamlet's father) - shows any sign of being fed up with having to perform encores. Christian Bale is on top form. Marion Cotillard is a more than usually fatal femme fatale, and Anne Hathaway's Selina enjoys herself playing a cat-burglar very close in style to Catwoman! Joseph Gordon-Levitt's independent-minded cop Blake looks as if he's being groomed for greater things, maybe even to pick up the 'mantle'.This is a long movie, but there is hardly a draggy moment in it. Bale and Nolan can congratulate themselves on delivering 'the goods' in three successive movies, which is something that does not always happen in 'franchise' movies.",8,2,6,4 August 2012
The Greatest Showman," 19th-century X-Factor
","This musical extravaganza on the life of P.T. Barnum is pitched at the X-Factor audience, much as MOULIN ROUGE was a few years ago. Don't expect to hear Hugh Jackman singing 'Oh What a Beautiful Morning' (which he has sung on-stage). It's not that kind of show. The songs are loud, with repetitious lyrics, staged like pop videos. P.T. Barnum was a 19th-century showman, but this is a decidedly 21st-century show.Zac Efron provides eye-candy for teenage viewers, but the movie totally belongs to Jackman, sounding better than he did in LES MIS and dancing like an Olympic athlete. Political correctness has diluted the 'freak show' with which Barnum begins his circus career - there's a bearded lady (with a fine belting voice), Tom Thumb and dancing Siamese twins, even a 'Wolf Boy', but nothing as grotesque as the Elephant Man, who, with other tragically deformed people, provided the 'lure' for punters into Barnum's circus.
;
This is not my idea of what a musical should be, but it's dazzlingly staged and performed with great exuberance and - somewhat against my better judgement - I enjoyed it!",7,4,8,17 February 2018
Saving Mr. Banks," A spoonful of saccharine
","This is one of those movies you slightly despise yourself for enjoying. There's not much to it. After a 20-year battle to secure the movie rights to MARY POPPINS, Walt Disney then has another battle to make the movie his way and not the way the author P.L. Travers thinks it should be made. Walt is played by Tom Hanks, looking as always like Tom Hanks. Pamela (there's a wearisome joke about her insistence on being addressed as 'Mrs Travers') is played by Emma Thompson as an elegant curmudgeon pitched somewhere between NANNY McPHEE and THE REMAINS OF THE DAY. There are frequent flashbacks to her childhood in Australia, a rural idyll wrecked by her father's battle with the booze. Colin Farrell looks a bit uncomfortable in the underwritten role of Dad, handsome and playful, a drunk but never a mean one. Rachel Griffiths is terribly wasted as the stern well-meaning Ozzie Auntie who we are meant infer is the inspiration for la Poppins. Paul Giamatti makes a meal out of the role of Mrs Travers's studio chauffeur, and Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak get some fun out of playing the Sherman brothers, who write the songs which Mrs Travers does not wish to hear or see in the film of her book.A spoonful of saccharine helps the movie go down. The story's fatal flaw is its predictability, not helped by the fact that most of us have a faint idea of how MARY POPPINS is going to turn out, cartoon sequence and blissfully daft songs and everything. But the tone of this movie is almost as charming as the tone of that movie, and Thompson and Hanks play their roles exactly right, however predictably. So - I'm going to have a go at emulating grinchy Craig from STRICTLY COME DANCING and give SAVING MR. BANKS a grudging 7 out of 10 (Bruno will probably give it a 9)!",7,5,13,6 December 2013
Midway," Vivid CGI lesson in naval history
","The last movie take on PEARL HARBOR (2001) was largely spoiled by a soapy love story. There's only one wife featured in Midway and she's just there as a token Woman Who Waits For Her Husband's Return. What Roland Emmerich gives us this time is a solid chunk of naval history, superbly illustrated by the GGI effects he used so thrillingly in INDEPENDENCE DAY and THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW.With lengthy scenes of both the Japanese and American battle planning, the movie shows how the Japanese superiority after the 'infamous' damage they inflicted on the US navy at Pearl Harbor was overcome, mostly thanks to radio intercepts and code-breaking by the guys at Naval Intelligence (sorry, ladies).Back stories are minimal, in keeping with the documentary style of the film. Woody Harrelson and Randy Quaid give un-showy performances as key admirals and all the fighter pilots play as a team, much as they would have in wartime, with nobody pushing for extra screen time. Good to see Luke Evans on solid form; he reminds me increasingly of the young Richard Harris, and I hope he has an equally substantial career ahead of him.The CGI bombing at Pearl Harbor and out in the Pacific is nothing less than awesome. Here and there the aerial combat scenes (and camera-shots behind ordnance) give off a PlayStation flavor, but overall MIDWAY does eloquent justice to a turning-point moment in 20th-century history.",8,2,3,13 November 2019
RED," Her majesty the killer queen!
","Helen Mirren doesn't appear till halfway through RED, playing an ex-MI6 assassin who still freelances and certainly demonstrates her skill with machine guns and grenade-launchers when the going gets tough. It's more than a little disconcerting to see an actress who not so long ago played Our Gracious Queen now out there as a rogue hitwoman! The plot is not exactly loaded down with plausibility but the chases and shoot-outs come thick and fast, and it's clear that the cast are having fun and you find yourself going along with this, much as you do with the panto-style antics in the Pirates of the Caribbean series. Mary-Louise Parker as Bruce Willis's innocent-caught-up-in-mayhem girlfriend provides a neat focal point for the viewer. John Malkovich gives an eye-rolling performance much as he did in Con Air. Brian Cox's Russian spymaster belongs in Round the Horne! There's even a cameo from Ernest Borgnine (always find myself thinking of the famous Ethel Merman story about her 50-year-old you-know-what!), now a sprightly 93. Bullets fly like snowflakes in a blizzard but not too many people seem to get shot. There's no gore and a (very) welcome drought of profanity.RED is not exactly up there with the best of the Jason Bourne franchise. In fact it's down there with some of the dafter Roger Moore Bonds, like Octopussy and A View to a Kill. But, like them, it's an easy movie to sit back and be carried away by. For us older viewers it seems to suggest that if Life didn't start at Forty, it maybe will at Sixty-Five!",7,1,2,26 October 2010
Godzilla," Gadzooks, it's GOOD Godzilla!
","Well, I hoped this would be a better movie than the 3D POMPEII, and my wish was granted - but only just. As with recent superhero movies - this, I guess, is a super-villain movie! - the writer and director have gone for a re-vamp. And they give us GOODzilla, helping humanity fight the giant bat-like dinosaurs who energise themselves by destroying nuclear power plants and digesting missiles. A lower-case wow.Leading man Aaron Taylor-Johnson), not unlike the hero of the new/ancient POMPEII, is a low-rent version of Channing Tatum, and the script doesn't manage to layer any charisma on him or his wife (Elizabeth Olsen). The performances here are not even up to TV-movie standards.Roland Emmerich's 1998 version of GODZILLA came in for a lot of flak from fans of the original clunky Japanese monster mash-ups of the 1950s, but the Emmerich film had more characters and a much busier storyline than this one. Today's GODZILLA, despite 3D and acres of CGI, is too obviously pitched, like the TRANSFORMERS series, at the toy-shop franchise. More thrilling than POMPEII, yes, but not much that's new here. A special-effects-laden package that turns out not to be very special at all.",6,0,1,28 May 2014
Looper," Confusing, intricate, pacey
","This clever and intricate movie borrows a theme from TERMINATOR and gives it an inventive twist. It's set in 2042 USA, which looks just as depressed as 2012 USA - apart from a few new not-too-futuristic flying machines. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Joe, one of a group of secret hit men whose job it is to dispatch people sent back from 2072 where killing has been outlawed (o brave new world!). Joe's mission takes a curious turn when his future self (Bruce Willis) is sent back for 'processing'. Old Joe sets out to find - and eliminate - the Rainmaker, his future nemesis. Young Joe has to try and protect both the present and the future.The quest of the Joes brings them to a remote farm where Sara (Emily Blunt) is raising mysterious kid Cid who has some spooky telekinetic skills. A bunch of thugs are also in pursuit make sure the mission is accomplished - if it was made clear which future these guys were from, I missed it!I'm not sure the time-play in this storyline completely holds together. It's as intricate as, say, INCEPTION or even MEMENTO. But there's great pace and tension, the CGI is clever without being overdone, and the actors treat this far-fetched scenario with a seriousness it may not merit. And it has a very satisfying climax.LOOPER is a lot better than most of this summer's mega-budget blockbusters.",7,0,4,5 October 2012
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Double-oh-six-and-a-half
","Co-written by Mrs Jonathan Ross (Jane Goldman) and director Matthew Vaughan, this is a smutty action comedy from the FAST AND FURIOUS school. Megabucks have clearly been spent on the fight scenes and CGI. Colin Firth and Mark Strong are visibly enjoying letting their hair down (Mark of course is bald), although Michael Caine looks as if he's uncomfortable slumming (not for the first time, Michael: we haven't forgotten Jaws 3D, hardly your finest hour). Taron Egerton, more Bourne than Bond, appears to have been cloned from Daniel Craig. Samuel L. Jackson's lisping zillionaire philanthropist and would-be world dominator Valentine is presumably spoofing Javier Basrdem in SKYFALL. Valentine's female sidekick runs on Pistorius-like blades that are more lethal than Oddjob's bowler hat, of fond recall.The death toll is like a war movie. The level of violence and the f-word quotient are probably way too high, but KINGSMAN is firmly pitched at the teenager in all of us; it certainly found the teenager in me and my companion, both of us clearly not kids but more clearly still kids at heart.",7,0,4,5 February 2015
The Cabin in the Woods," Homage till it hurts
","Co-written by BUFFY's Joss Whedon this is a high-tech new take on the Friday THE 13TH scenario. The new - or not so new - element here is that the horrors visited upon the five hapless occupants of a spooky lakeside cabin are being manipulated by a team of technicians in a vast laboratory beneath them, not unlike the people controlling the island in LOST.The 'controllers' include a couple of faces familiar from THE WEST WING and (appropriately) SIX FEET UNDER. There's even a cameo from Sigourney Weaver playing a variant on her AVATAR character.Joss Whedon has a lot of fun mounting an elaborate deconstruction (I blame Wes Craven for this!) of the last 10-30 years of horror movies. THE EVIL DEAD, THE THING, THE SHINING - almost every schlock-horror you can think of is referenced. The (ludicrous) exposition at the end is - almost - a throwback to the Denis Wheatley era (does anyone, apart from me, remember him?).The zombie assaults on our hapless cabin crew are as visceral as anything in the SAW series or its many imitators; the frontier into 'Torture Porn' is approached if not quite crossed. Great pace, super effects, lots of make-you-jump moments (not too many make-you-scream moments: that's harder to bring off today), but THE CABIN IN THE WOODS is like an extended Tribute Show. It doesn't have that vital spark of originality that gave, say, DRAG ME TO HELL its extra 'zing'.",7,1,8,20 April 2012
Spectre," SPOOKS casts a long shadow
","Well, after the long wait - and all the hype - here it is, the new Bond picture. Does it live up to the hype? Yes - and no.The stunts are what gives the movie its momentum and they seem not to rely too much on CGI. The plot, broadly a sequel to Daniel Craig's three previous outings, provides Bond with a series of brief violent encounters with SPECTRE's Oberhauser much as he had in the past with Silva and Le Chiffre and other Bonds with Hugo Drax, Mr Big and everybody else all the way back to Dr No. There's a strong feeling of old motifs being recycled here, with scenes that provide echoes from the Roger Moore era and even George Lazenby's. Herr Oberhauser has a henchman who seems to have been cloned (scary biology at work!) from Oddjob and Jaws. The desert climax is a bit too reminiscent of QUANTUM, and the London 'epilogue', exciting as it may be, is also a re-tread. Where CASINO ROYALE really did seem to breathe new life - and the spirit of Jason Bourne - into the franchise, SPECTRE and SKYFALL have shown Sam Mendes taking on board the 'realpolitik' reach of television's SPOOKS, with Craig's 007 falling - almost believably - somewhere between the superhero and the street-corner spy.",7,4,20,4 November 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," An American Hero without a gun
","Wow. Mel Gibson's 'comeback' as a director is a war movie more savage, more visceral than anything I've seen since Hammer's CAMP ON BLOOD ISLAND in 1958, which probably wasn't as brutal as I remember it.Andrew Garfield is a powerful central presence as the Christian boy from Alabama who wants to serve his country with a medical kit rather than a gun and who is viewed by his comrades first as a coward, then as a hero. As he did in SILENCE last month, Garfield continues to remind me of the young Montgomery Clift. Sam Worthington contributes a solid performance as the platoon captain, Hugo Weaving and Rachel Griffiths as Garfield's violent drunken father and abused mother were presumably cast as a 'nod' to Gibson's Australian roots.The end-credit 'portfolio' of photos and interviews with the real- life Desmond Doss and the men he served with clearly underlines the fact that this is a true story about an amazing true hero. Viewers may wonder if Gibson ramped up the battle scenes a few degrees. Was there really as much 'medieval' hand-to-hand combat between our guys and the Japanese soldiers on Okinawa as there was in the Crusades or the Wars of the Roses? Did our guys really torch the enemy with flame- throwers? Did Desmond Doss really single-handedly save so many wounded soldiers (some of them Japanese)?As in BRAVEHEART and APOCALYPTO (and even in THE PASSION OF THE Christ), Mel Gibson focuses perhaps too lingeringly on gory death and dismemberment, but there's no denying that Hacksaw Ridge brings home the full horror of war – and the outstanding heroism that can blossom amid the carnage.",8,2,6,1 February 2017
The Great Gatsby," An overstuffed armchair of a movie
","Leonardo DiCaprio and Casey Mulligan look terrific, but DiCaprio's performance is a bit puppet-like, though this may be Baz Luhrmann's direction, and Mulligan doesn't quite capture the shallow brittleness of Daisy the way Farrow did. Tobey Maguire is outstandingly good as Daisy's narrator cousin Nick, a character who may have inspired L.P Hartley to create the boy Leo in THE GO-BETWEEN. The big fault with the movie - and it will always be there - is Scott Fitzgerald's fault: not enough happens. Will Daisy and Gatsby recapture their lost love? What's the truth about his past? These are the only two elements to the story. An already slim plot gets thinner with such an extended adaptation. And repeated overcrowded parties and long tracking shots soon begin to look like the padding is coming out of this overstuffed armchair of a movie.It's visually glorious (and I only saw the 2D version) but it's a bit like a sweet with a hollow centre.",6,2,4,29 June 2013
Alien: Covenant," Waiting for a John Hurt moment
","A sequel to the prequel. Are we still on-message?Ten years on from our last venture into deepest darkest space, another vast spaceship full of cryogenically dormant colonists is diverted by a radio signal to the planet where the Prometheus is marooned with robot David ('synthetics', they prefer to be called) the last survivor. Even before they find David, two of the crew inhale something nasty which puts the viewer on alert for a 'John Hurt' moment: there will be more than two of these.The Covenant also has a synthetic crew member, Walter. Walter is an 'upgrade' of David, but his twin in looks, with both of them played by Michael Fassbender. Much as we had good Arnie and bad Arnie in the first two TERMINATOR films, we have good and bad synthetics here, supplying the main plot ingredient – unless you think of the mutations and killings as the main course on the menu, which they more or less are.The CGI (awesome) and the pace (erratic) of this epic try, not entirely successfully, to blind us to the fact that both on the planet and back on the mothership, there is some heavy recycling of the first two episodes in this 38-year saga. Billy Crudup's captain is very much a re-run of the doomed captain of the Nostromo, and Katherine Waterston's ballsy Daniels is practically a clone of Sigourney Weaver's Ripley (who was, as we fondly remember, cloned herself in 1997's RESURRECTION). Michael Fassbender is glamorous and persuasive in his Frankensteinian double role, but some of us still yearn for Sigourney to return.COVENANT is more of an action movie than PROMETHEUS, which ventured down the mock-philosophical road of the STAR TREK series. It's also more of a horror movie, with regular infusions of 'face-huggers' and slaughter. Good scary fun. This franchise still has a bit of (alien) life in it.",7,6,13,19 May 2017
The Martian," Robinson Crusoe on Mars
","The plot of THE MARTIAN, unlike SPECTRE's, is not a closely guarded secret. We know the storyline: space botanist Matt Damon is left for dead on Mars when his fellow astronauts evacuate during a vicious storm. But Matt's not dead. Will he survive? Will they they rescue him?You kind of know the answer to these key questions, so director Ridley Scott has to work extra hard to generate suspense. Matt's survival skills are given some stringent challenges, and a lot can (and does) go wrong with the rescue mission. Damon's powerful screen presence manages to hold our interest during the Robinson Crusoe parts of the story - even better, I would say, than Tom Hanks in CASTAWAY, one of the many films that are unavoidably echoed here (GRAVITY being the most obvious).Despite all the CGI I found Ridley Scott's Mars less visually enthralling than Paul Verhoeven's in the original TOTAL RECALL; it looks like (which it is) a rose-tinted version of the Jordan valleys where LAWRENCE OF ARABIA was filmed. The space scenes are awesome and possess some of the pure magic of Kubrick's 2001. Hugely enjoyable as THE MARTIAN is, it's one of those movies that you realise afterwards reminded you of other fine movies. GLADIATOR's magnificence dims when you take note of how much it borrowed from BEN HUR. ALIEN wasn't actually all that original, but what a great movie it still is whenever you remember it! (PROMETHEUS was epic but disappointing somehow.) THE MARTIAN is a good movie, even a very good movie, but it falls short of being a great movie.",8,3,7,22 October 2015
