","I think this was in almost all ways an excellent film. I think it is one of the best films that I have seen in a long time. It had a bit of everything you are looking for. It has you laughing at one point and then feeling that love bug the next. It is a excellent film for men and women alike. The only negative this I have to say is that I wish some of the tacky humor could have been toned down a bit. Not a family film that is for sure. But it could easily have been. The connection between Sandler and Barrymore was awesome. She was stunning in this movie and a joy to watch. I recommend this highly!!! It is Happy Madisons best yet, and I hope for more like it in the future!",9,0,0,17 February 2004

",All I can say is I am in awe of the high rating of this film... Seems like it tried hard to be another Moulin Rouge and just fell totally flat on its face. I tried to just sit back and watch this with and open mind but it was just a hodge podge mess of a film. The characters lacked depth and warmth. In the end you do not care much if they get together or not you just want the movie to end already. Terrible movie.... I enjoyed Frida that at least had some feeling and depth to it. This was just a shallow mess that had a lot of potential but did not make it there. If you are looking for a good movie to sit down and enjoy I advise you look elsewhere. I wish I could get those two and a half hours of my life back... LAME,1,10,24,29 September 2007
