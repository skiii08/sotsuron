","Finally, Another El laberinto del fauno (Pan's Labyrinth) movie, after Shutter Island... Even deeper than Inception... It's a great movie.Many people just see it as a 'Chick Show'. I don't care about that, as Zack Snyder's action movie always an R-Rated... In fact this is Snyder's first non R-Rated action movie. But I really don't care. All I care is how the story, the scenes, the ideas, the OSTs, It's all great.For a fan of fantasy movies, it's scenes and actions are great. But there's a movie I like more than a fantasy one. A psychological one, complicated, and need a lot of thinking, and I think that's why many people don't like it, it just got the wrong hype.",9,3,6,10 July 2011
