The New World," The slowest moving movie I've ever seen!
","I have to admit, I was extremely excited to watch this movie. I thought it was going to be romantic, touching and spell binding movie. However, I did not go and see it in the theaters, I rented it shortly after it came out and I am glad that I did not waste my money at the theater.I thought it was an extremely slow movie. The plot seemed to drag on and on with no point whatsoever. They could have cut half the scenes in the movie, it would still make sense and i would still have 2 hours of my life left.Don't get me wrong, all you Colin Farrell fans out there. I am a huge fan of Colin, however in a movie like this, there is only so much that a good looking leading man can do.So overall, The New World is a waste of time to watch. If it was chopped in half and had quicker moving scenes then it would be an OK movie. If you have the chance to read this comment before you watch this movie i beg you to not watch it and save 3 hours of your life for something more important!",3,4,6,29 February 2008
