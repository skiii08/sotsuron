Mission: Impossible III," Ethan Hunt is sent to capture a powerful arms dealer before a mysterious weapon falls in the wrong hands.
","In my opinion Mission Impossible III, exceeds in story, creativity, characterization, and overall quality over the other two M:I films.The characters in this film have more dimensions to them (especially the villain), unlike the mass-claimed flatness that poisoned first two movies. This film does a really good job at showing Ethan Hunt as a man with a life style, and not just a spy. Although at times, I felt he didn't show the right amount of emotion that was needed during certain situations.It really makes senses that Ethan can't tell his fianc√© of his life as an IMF agent, and really adds a whole new kind of conflict, instead of the old don't-get-killed-by-the-bad-guys theme.This film also has some pretty nifty action sequences, such as the unforgettable bridge bombing, and an over-the-top parachute sequence.To add even more flavor, this film features an unforgettable villain. I truly believe this is just not the best villain of all the Mission: Impossible movies, but (do I dare say) one that will stand out amongst other villains (book and film) for years to come.I really enjoyed this movie, and one I easily recommend. Two thumbs up.",9,0,1,18 July 2006
