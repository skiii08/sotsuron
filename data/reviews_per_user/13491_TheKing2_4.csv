Blade Runner 2049," Acoustic lens flare
",This is an amazing piece of work. Really. Both in story and in cinematography. A must see 100% . Casting and screenwriting is paramount. The visuals stunning. But the soundtrack is,9,0,5,17 January 2020
Oblivion," You should watch it, realky
","This is a great movie and should be on a short list for all Sci fy aficionados. The pace and reveal has a Moon ish value to it. But this has Cruise AND Freeman in it! The visuals are abs stunning, the techno vibe, sound and motion has it completely. I mean who would not dive in a pool with earth view at the bottom? The story is, although believable really very compressed. But this a movie, not a 400 page novel. Go see it, really. You should.",8,0,0,22 May 2020
I Am Legend," Uncanny good performance of mr Will Smith
","No, I'm not a fan. But William, prince of bell air shines in this flick. Contrair to I Robot Mr Smith does show what it takes to carry a movie. No comparison to the Omega Man this is a much watchable flick. Really go see it.",7,0,1,6 October 2019
Gladiator," a perfect waste of celluloid
",Not sure were to start. A great director a very fine cast. A pointless movie. It starts with again a PotC soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. I'm perfectly sure he can write an excellent score but he has been hiding that virtue for a very long time. I'm almost convinced that Mr. Ridley Scott let Mr. George Lucas take the honor's. The characters are quite as flat as they are on Star Wars 1 2 and 3. Even cinematography makes you squirm. Zoom in on a actor while he is monologuing? That hasn't been done since the 70ties and was dealt with there and than. Both Ben Hur and Spartacus were done over 40 years ago and were more convincing and better acted. Also watch Titus and be really stunned by acting soundtrack and story.skip it,5,5,11,9 January 2013
