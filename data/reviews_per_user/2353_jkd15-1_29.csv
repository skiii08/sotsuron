The Incredible Hulk," OK movie but not great!
","This is not a 10 Star movie or even an 8 Star movie. Its a 6 Star movie at best.There is little resemblance to the comic book in this movie. It should be called 'big green monster'. The 're-boot' is a flop. Oh and by the way, stop saying reboot. Its stupid! The fight scene at the end is anti-climatic and predictable from about a third of the way into the movie.I can't believe people are giving this 10 stars or that the original got bad reviews. It was much more comic book like and more true to character.Ed Norton is miscast in this film as Downey was perfectly cast for Iron Man. Which by the way, was a stellar movie.The Hulk in this movie is almost like a green bodybuilder and to human like. The hulk is not supposed to be fit and trim but an over-sized oddity, obscenely huge, defying reality as in the comic book.It appears that Stan Lee bowed to public pressure and made a movie called 'big green monster'. Angst Lee had it right. The first iteration was true to the comic book and the acting was better with real interaction and feeling between the characters. I cared much more for the characters in the original than this unfeeling walk through.Did I say Norton was miscast? If I didn't, let me say it again. Ed Norton is a superb actor but is wrong for this movie.In addition. The ending where Stark comes into the bar seems like they decided to throw it in last minute and seemed out of place. Is he talking about the Avengers? Now that I would like to see. How are they going to show Captain America. Do you think they are gonna show him in tights.The first movie wsn't perfect but much better than this almost flop.",6,1,4,12 July 2008
3:10 to Yuma," Good movie but not great or very good.
","I thought the final comment from Bale to his son was self indulging and actually, almost ruined the movie for me. Instead of being someone who believed in honor he just did it for himself and his own reputation. This was not a movie about honor but trying to make yourself look better to your family.The blunder of this movie was having Russell Crowe in it. He is such a good actor and portrayed in such a good manner that he was actually the true hero. The movie should have been that Crowe is mistaken in what or how people thought he was and Bale realizing that Crowes character was not this person came to his aide.Some of the scenes were hard to believe and I wondered how the gang chasing them in the end couldn't realize that Crowe was actually not in trouble.And the premise of a company man had the authority to bring Crowe to justice and get him to the train was absurd. By the way, Dallas Roberts is the hidden gem in this movie. He is a superb actor and deserves many more roles.This movie could have been excellent but the premise was not legit.Outside of the above it was watchable and enjoyable and mainly because of Crowe.Bale is a good actor. I am not ready to say great yet. And as an earlier poster wrote about Bale being the next Gregory Peck? I don't think so. At least not yet. At this point he is certainly not in the same category as Crowe who is among the best today.A good movie and watchable.",7,0,2,8 May 2008
Unbreakable," Best sleeper in 20 years.
","Not since the Thief has a movies caught me by surprise. I started watching out of the corner of my eye as I was doing something else and I suddenly found myself thoroughly engrossed. Further, this movie is almost 10 years old and I just watched it now! How could this be? Well it proves there are still gems to be found in movie world.Willis and Jackson together in a mini masterpiece.I didn't even realize the premise until half way through as I didn't have any prelim.Who needs costumes or special effects. Certainly not this movie. Take a good script, great direction and a superb cast and you have a great movie.This movie may just be too much for the PG crowd so watch it first before the kids.",9,1,1,25 September 2009
Star Trek," Almost but not quite
","Before I start. This was a good movie and entertaining. Some of the fight scenes with the Enterprise were awesome. Especially the final fight scene where the Enterprise comes out of the black hole with cannons blazing.I wasn't a fan of the voices though. Kirks was very good but only done once. Scotties was pitiful and without the sincerity of the original. Oh and it sounded fake. The one I liked was from Checkoff(spelling).The movie tried to jam too much into the film without creating character or relationships. There was little chemistry between characters and the time warp with the original Spock was corny.With all that negative, it was still a decent watchable movie. Makes me want to watch the original for the great chemistry and banter.I am saddened by the miscues but entertained by the overall movie.",7,2,6,26 October 2009
The English Patient," A great Love Story
",How this film gets low marks is beyond me. I certainly believe in the right to free speech but come on people.The English Patient is a story of love between two people brought together by WWII.I was immersed throughout and brought to the brink of tears at the end.The story and sub plots revolve around a man and a woman who fall in love and the consequences of their actions due to this.A film with murderous jealousy and revenge. A film that takes one from the deadly grips of the dessert to lovemaking in a bathtub. From Nazi interrogations to disarming bombs. From horrible plane crashes to celebration.An epic film of love lust murder and escape.One of the best films of the last 20 years.Sit back with a huge tub of pop corn and be entertained. If you are a male as I am but under the age of 25 you might want to pass on this one unless you possess wisdom beyond your years.,10,8,15,8 May 2008
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Very good romantic comedy
","There are some pretty good redeeming qualities to this movie. There are some true to life scenes. Overall the movie descends just under excellent and stands just below the Descendants which was an easy 9 star flick.Ryan Gosling stands out with an excellent performance as a womanizer with style, class and a hint of humanity in his mentor ship to Carrol's character.Some scenes seem to not be right for the movie and some seem to be made to slide under a cookie cut like movie.Overall it is an above the fray movie and stands as a great watch and a worthy addition to any DVD collection.Definitely not a family movie as I wouldn't watch it with the kids due to embarrassing and adult content but I might not be adverse to a teen watching it.Enjoy!",8,3,4,17 November 2012
Public Enemies," Good movie worth the watch Depp is good as usual.
","I find it very hard to dislike basic dramas when Depp is in them. His talent is to often wasted on movies of a comic book type. This is your basic retelling of the Dillinger criminal hero of the 30s. I liked the story line. Its hard to tell the life of such a famous character in 90+ minutes and you have to fit a lot of stuff into the movie so you also tell history as well as the personal story of the character.It's a sad story of a somewhat decent but violent criminal(Depps role) who becomes the target of governmental change in policy. The story is told in a way that you see Dillinger as a political target as the mob is forming into a business entity and the beginning of federal enforcement on a local level. Though one might find pity in how Dillinger is made the scapegoat, one has to remind themselves that he was an arch criminal and had to be stopped. But the rebel in oneself might want him to escape with his woman to a far away place.Depp gives humanity to Dillinger and Bale does a very good job as the hunter.",7,0,0,8 February 2010
Terminator Salvation," Actor script switch.
","This movie appears to have had a lead and script switch mid shoot. Rare but it does happen. Sam Worthington appears to be the original lead with Bale thrown in last second. This may not be the case but has that feel. So they had to adjust the script to that decision.I think the John Conners role was going to be a character but not the lead in the movie. He may have even been dead already. Kyle Reese and Marcus Wright were to be the staring pair. And Moon Bloodgood was going to be the female lead and Marcus's romantic as she is in this script version.My guess is the producers got cold feet and stuck their big noses into the script and actors list and ruined the movie. They probably said, uh oh, we don't have a big name actor.Personally I think the director purposely ruined the movie because the powers that be ruined the script.Bale, was terrible and certainly appeared to be out of place. Please, who made him do the Batman voice again. It was bearable in Batman but stupid in this movie.The director had a great script which would have started the series all over again with Worthington as the half human half terminator. Did you see the scene where they are getting into the jeep and Worthington says to the kid ' Don't look at me like that Star.' It was out of place. Worthington was supposed to have a relationship with the kid. But since the script was destroyed we didn't see any character development to justify that comment.By the way, Worthington is as good an actor as Bale, maybe better.Bale was terrible from the start. Out of place and uninspired. Again, I am guessing here, but it appears Bale took the role for the money. He had some free time between gigs and was given this part.I could see Bale on set, going around to the actors apologizing for stepping all over their movie.Anyway, what we get as movie goers is a mish mash of scenes that the director tried to give in somewhat of a thoughtful way but without any heart as the true movie had been ruined by untalented, distrusting old men with money. imhoI can see the director sitting in his directors chair and getting a message from upstairs that says ' More CGI and more Bale'This isn't all that's wrong with this movie but the bulk of what is. Whats with the terminator leeches. Could someone please explain this to me? Oh and what's with the new terminators that look like the robot from an Iron Maiden concert. At one point it looked like one of them was smoking a cigar.Everything you think is pretty good in this movie is the original script. Anything that seems stupid or out of place, you can call the Bale script.",5,3,4,21 December 2009
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Not your everyday movie
","Well, this movie appears to somewhat be divided between the book readers and non book readers. I haven't read the book so went along for the ride missing information and enjoyed it.Some loose ends were not tied up for me in the movie. Did the one spy get the girl. Did they send the other spy back. What happened to some of the spies.Who the hell was who. The main problem watching this movie is the assumption that the viewer already knows who many of the characters are and unless one watches 'very' intently one struggles to follow and really, can't completely anyway.Very well filmed and very well acted. Gary Oldman is a force to be reckoned with and unfortunately, isn't given more cerebral type roles to show his prowess intellectually and whether through necessity or preference, is cast in mystical and sci fi roles.Barely know any of the other actors but all were excellent actors.",7,1,2,26 September 2012
No Country for Old Men," Great start; dismal ending.
","Here was a movie with great potential and lived up to it until about the last half hour. Where do I start? This movie had the potential to be a great movie but lost it in the last half hour. First of all, Josh Brolin was the star of this movie and should be first listing. He played a great part of a simple but witty and sharp cowboy.Tommy Lee Jones downplayed his role and was not at his greatest as a mopey Sheriff. His role didn't affect the movie as any actor could have portrayed this character. He did have a couple of good lines though. And his star quality did help the movie as he does have a great presence on screen.Javier Bardem excelled at his role with a stunning performance of a ruthless and truly psychotic with just a hint of and I mean hint of humanity.You will love the first three quarters of the movie. Brolin played his part to perfection and I really liked his character.Where did Woody Harrelson come from? He appeared near the end of the movie and had 3 scenes and was killed-off. I must say though, he played an excellent character and is a very good actor. His facial expressions at the time of his execution were superb.Here is where the movie bombs. The movie spends all of its time building the character of Brolin 'Llewelyn' and is then killed-off. Huh? At least if you are to kill him off, show it! Put some meaning to it. Just don't show him dead. You spent the whole movie building his character and then kill him off without any experience for the audience. Basically, you just sh#t on the movie.The director let this movie die. I don't know what he was trying to do. I don't know if he was catering to Tommy Lee or what but he just couldn't put it together. Maybe it was time constraints but the movie was cut short with quicky solutions. Its almost like he spent to much time on the beginning and ran out of space and had to make a quick exit.Viewers should not let this or other movies get away with it and give ten stars. This movie is not a 10 star movie!!The premise of the title, I guess, must have moved this movie but Jones' character was not strong enough or created enough to propel the title. The title premise should have been a side thought.",7,1,4,15 May 2008
The Love Guru," Silly fun
","I am going over the top with the rating because I feel a certain sexually orientated group is bashing this movie over the top because they can't laugh at themselves.Mike Myers is a funny guy and the slapstick scenes in this movie are what is to be expected from him.I laughed out loud several times.But see the point here is you can't be such a prude or so sensitive that you can't laugh at funny when funny is funny.There are about ten laugh out loud scenes in this movie and if you can't see it then to bad.If you are going to see Mike Myers and not expect this type of movie then you should re-evaluate what you think he does.As gross as pee soaked mop fighting may sound to you, I laugh at the mere mention of it. I laughed at a review which mentioned it.",10,6,17,15 July 2008
District 9," One of the more original films.
","Don't worry, no spoilers here. I was truly entertained and surprised throughout the entire movie. The creativeness reigned supreme throughout. First the main them was interesting. Then the movie takes you from thinking the movie is one way and then another. Then humanity shows where you never think it will when you first start watching. There is enough good and evil and enough action/violence to keep most anyone happy. I would say though, that children under twelve should not see and over twelve, the parents should watch it first to see if they want their kids to watch. Some of the violence would be considered epic and well, of mature theme. Over 16 should be OK though. This is a Sci FI masterpiece and one of the best ever made.",9,2,4,20 September 2009
Behind The Candelabra," Nothing great but watchable due to movie set and degradation.
","This movie holds nothing great or engrossing and is a one sided bio on Liberace. Making a movie based on the descriptions from a jaded lover, offers sketchy re tellings in terms of reality.What one does find is two star male actors of the day, playing kissie face, hump the tiger and making lovey dovey throughout a quarter of the movie which seems to be it's purpose.Nothing of matter or worth comes of this movie. There is no character building, no feel or any sense of self awareness but endless degradation.Basically, its a movie about a very wealthy man who uses his wealth and fame to seduce and run through scores of young men with one of them tractable enough to get talked into a sick operation by a very degraded man.If one wants to watch several degraded and sick people degrade each other with sex, body deformation, drugs and emotional abuse then one will watch this movie.I went into this with the hope to find an artist's story about an ambiguous man and his battles with his demons. Sort of a 'Gods and Monsters' which was a stellar movie but found a movie with little substance.Do not let the children anywhere near this movie and block HBO while it's running. It should only be shown after 11PM. This movie could definitely distort young minds as the script is quite disgusting.",Null,3,15,28 May 2013
Schindler's List," Historical Masterpiece!!
","There are some movies that are so good,realistic and sad that it is hard for me to re-watch them. This is one.I haven't watched this since and probably won't ever. Its just to difficult to watch the torture and sufferings of a people as superbly displayed in this movie.Its about a German officer who saves Jews from the holocaust and will probably make you cry. Its hard to fathom how a people can be so cruel to another people.If you haven't seen this movie you should. The acting is superb!And the historical reference is important to know.",10,9,13,8 May 2008
The Mist," Good Horror flick with an unreal ending.
","This is one of those movies you think will be stupid but turns out to be pretty good. The good: Excellent acting. Superb graphics and special effects. Fresh idea. Good interaction between characters. Good attempt at representing religious zealousness.(Though a little overblown.)The bad: Some of the characters were not allowed to evolve enough, particularly, Andre Braugher's role. I don't know if he wanted to bow out of the role or what but there was some good chemistry between him and Thomas Jane. The unreality of his role was stupid. The tentacle which dissolved was stupid and seemed to be thrown in to make it impossible for others in the cast to see it which helped the premise of no one believing them in the beginning. And the biggest mistake of this movie was when Thomas Jane assisted suicided the four other survivors with him, not to mention his son.HELLO!! It seems the director wanted this ending so bad he was willing to forget about reality. Lets face it, wouldn't you or any other sane person wait until the monsters were literally moments away from eating you before you killed yourself? Why go to all that work of escape to instantly kill yourself when the truck runs out of gas. Sometimes a little formula is good. The best ending would have been the five survivors being passed by the army vehicles and have one of the people transports have the people from the store in it. And as it passes by the five people from the escape stare them down as the store people cowered from their shame.",7,0,1,10 May 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Great start Uninspired ending.
",This movie had some great potential. The first half was very entertaining. It began to die out after his first romance with the wife of a politician. It just seemed to lose heart and emotion. His supposed true love interest and he had no chemistry whatsoever. She seemed to play the aloof dancer OK but she was not very good displaying love or emotion.I was bored and annoyed with the ending and turned it off. Just blah half way through.I think the main problem is they tried to jump to him looking young to fast. There should have been more adventure as an older man and more interaction with the characters he met.The scenes with the wife of the politician was full of passion and should have played a bigger role. How can you have a story with two loves stories.Just some real bad scripting and poor direction. Even Brad showed a loss of interest in the second half.,6,1,2,22 September 2009
Transformers," Good Movie!!!
","The premise is absurd because it lacks any reality and it is not possible to realistically portray the characters.With that said, it is entertaining and endearing. You actually did feel for the good transformers and there was a good amount of good and evil portrayal to keep me interested.This certainly isn't a great movie but it is definitely not a bad movie.It's a fantasy movie for kids and adults alike. Something an adult and child could see together and enjoy.I wish the family was more in the plot and I would have like to see more of his father.Some of the action was difficult to watch on a smaller screen.Some of the action was not easy to follow and the plotting was not well laid out in some areas.",7,1,2,15 August 2008
Dumb and Dumber," Funniest movie of the past 50 years.
","This movie brought and brings so many laughs to me I have to give it a 10.I remember watching this movie alone about 10 years ago and laughing.Then I watched it again with someone else and laughed even harder.And then again with another person and laughing.And then watching it again with the same person and still laughing.And then watching it recently and still laughing.You get tired of one scene or scenes and then laugh at something else passed over the last time.The plot doesn't really matter and is cookie cutter. You could actually make this a drama or suspense movie. Or even a James Bond movie.It just doesn't matter. Funny is Funny and that's what this movie is.Two scenes stand out as ones which got me going the most, First, the scene when the bad guy kills the bird and Jim says 'Our bird's heads are falling off' This had me rolling on the floor and laughing uncontrollably. And the second when Jim gets whacked on the back of the knees going to the party with the owls.Many other scenes are very funny.If you haven't watched this movie, do so with another person. Its funnier with someone else.",10,3,6,12 March 2009
Taken," The best action movie of the past twenty years!!
","The only reason this movie does not get a ten is the ending which I thought could have been better. The very end when he has his daughter back Absolutely superbly made and directed. Liam Neeson is a superb actor and plays this part as good as anyone.He basically cuts a path of destruction through many many bad guys, all who deserve an early demise.It's done with style and righteousness which hasn't been done in a very long time.What I like about the movie the most is the intention of the lead actor Liam. His sole purpose is to get his daughter back safely. There is no posing for the camera or extra kill shots to emphasize the revenge. He just wants to get his daughter and anything in his way gets it good.Not since the Patriot has a movie of this type and quality been made.If you want an hour and a half of blazing action with non stop thrills done with class then this is for you.",9,2,4,13 December 2009
Avatar," One of the greatest movies ever made.
","Some movies deserve a ten and this is one of them. Absolutely spectacular imagery and graphics. Spellbinding effects and scenes throughout the whole movie. This movie is a jump to a whole new realm of movie making not available in the 20th century. To have a movie based mainly in CGI create such feeling and spirituality just knocks my socks off. From the flying jellyfish to the natives to the creatures, I never thought I was watching an animated(mostly) movie. I might not take children under 7 to see this movie as there is a bit of violence and some sensuality. But for the shear beauty and revolution in movie making, I would definitely consider taking children under 10. As an adult who is based in 'real' movies, I was glued to the TV throughout the whole adventure. If your real set in watching movies based completely in reality, I still say, give this movie a shot. At least through the first hour. The movie is long, very long at three hours but I didn't notice.",10,2,11,7 July 2010
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Alan Rickman only redeeming value.
","Relatively boring and mundane series of movies based on the book series. I've watched them to add value to the books and give me faces for more depth to the books. And that is all the movies are capable of. Though the ending to prisoner of askaban was not bad, the follow-up's ending was boring and voldemart not very convincing.Unfortunately, the only redeeming actor has passed and any hope for an offshoot is gone. Alan Rickman and Radcliffes(Great physical features.) character are the only ones that rings true and are the one I see constantly as I read his character in the books. The others not so much.The movies should have been based around Rickman and Oldman and their characters from the book. Really, the only great actors in this series. Richard Harris doesn't fit for me in his roll.Everyone else should have been co-star and back story.",6,0,0,7 March 2017
There Will Be Blood," Excellent excellent movie.
","My theory about movies is if you don't think any of the actors are acting then chances are its an excellent movie. Well that theory holds up well here.I think what frustrates some people who watch this movie and I must confess me to, is you get no clear line of whether Daniel is a good guy or a bad guy.He does things that you like and agree with and then he takes such a vengeful stance on things you wonder. Should he have killed the fake brother or let him stay with him as a confidant? The guy sure seemed to be on his side.I agreed that the priest needed a good butt-whooping as Daniel gave him. But should he have murdered him in the end or shown mercy? Lets face it the priest was a fake profit and general sleaze-bag but was murder the correct option. Though I do love the final line of the movie. What was it. 'I'm all done here.' Did he guzzle booze at the movies end in his bowling room? Vodka? That was a gruesome scene. And watching him eat in that final scene with the priest was mesmerizing.Alcoholism had set in and possibly brain damage. He had the gait that comes along with it.Well the acting from the whole cast was superb.Loved the movie.Now if your looking for a true present day hall of fame actor look no further than Daniel Day Lewis. He is on par with Crowe and Phoenix.",9,1,3,14 July 2008
Hitch," Entertaining love story.
","The one thing that bothered me was that someone would want to be with someone who back stabbed them by writing a story about them in a rag. If someone had done that to me, I would have been so long gone.That's why the movie gets a 7 and not an 8 out of 10 from me. Other than that, James is funny as all heck and is quite a good physical comedian. Smith does his thing which is always entertaining. Smith deserves better scripts on the whole but I think he gets flagged as a comedian and studios don't want to risk 'good' drama scripts on him.Worth the watch.Probably good for 13 and over.",7,0,1,14 June 2013
Shooter," Very good 7 out of 10 movie
",You really can't give this movie more than 7 stars due to the cookie cutter been there before plot.I love Wahlberg aka Marky Mark as an actor. Always plays a convincing role.The movie was very entertaining and had some interesting twists at the end.It was almost comical in the portrayals of the bad politicians. They were so evil and relished in it as devils. Laughing insidiously in the end and at other parts in the movie. Almost absurd.But I was entertained as I am with most of Marks movies.,7,1,3,26 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Best of a disappointing series though rushed to market.
","The end of the book, from a fantastic series, was incredibly exhilarating. None of this was brought forth in this series ending movie. The ending was off from the book and frankly, just not very good. Even for someone that didn't read the books which is probably rare, the anticlimactic ending was a letdown.The good. Some better acting overall. The effects were more on cue and the feel was pretty good. Didn't Neville kill the snake at Harry's awakening from feigned death? Didn't Harry and Voldemort circle each other in front of the students and teachers. And wasn't there a big hurrah after Harry killed him?From poor acting and character building, this whole series of movies was a general letdown. I understand the need to put all the major points of the book onto film but why stray at the end and change the ending. The very awesome ending.I don't know. I give this whole series a 'C'",6,1,1,14 April 2017
Casino," Best Las Vegas Movie ever made.
","Had me on the edge of my seat most of the time. Pesci is scary period. Dinero is possibly the greatest actor of my generation. Throw those two in a greatly scripted film and surround them with great supporting actors and you cant help but make a great movie.I don't consider this Goodfellas 2 but its close. Its a variant with two actors carried over. Don't get me wrong, This film stands very well on its own merit. If you never saw Goodfellas it wouldn't matter.You can always tell a great movie when you forget you are watching one.The violence is very scary and powerful. I grimaced several times the first time I saw it. The realism is there in every sense.A great rise and fall movie. In certain respects its sad the old days are over. There was an aura about it. But on the other hand, the Mafia was just to damned violent.",9,3,4,6 May 2008
Slumdog Millionaire," Barely Watchable.
","This movie had some promise but became boring. Contrived plot and all over the place. Absurd scenes. What police force tortures someone who wins a national game show. This movie could have been really good but the base premise held no water.If this is what has become the norm for academy awards then count me out.I am not so much against some of the ways of life in India as I do believe some of the horrors perpetrated on the children, in the movie, holds water.The game show premise was absurd and took away from what could have been a superb movie about children in the middle east.The scenery was spectacular with excellent visuals and great panoramic views of India.There was good chemistry among the children and some nice chicanery perpetrated.I heard the children stars of this movie were paid very poorly. Something amounting to 700.00 dollars. If this is the case, then what hypocrisy.",5,18,42,24 February 2009
Goodfellas," A great great movie.
","This has become such a great movie to me I faithfully watch it once a year. I wish it hadn't competed with 'Dances With Wolves' in 1990 because, well, how can you argue with that decision. But if it had won, I certainly would have been happy.Such an epic film; such great acting from everyone involved. Quite frankly, I think it missed a lot of academy awards because, really, you could have given it to everyone. How many supporting actors can you give it to.But really, come on, Jeremy Irons over Ray Liotta?Anyway, I assume most have seen it and if you haven't then you have an incredible movie to watch, if you wish.Every single scene was masterly directed by Scorsese. I saw this 15 years ago and was riveted to the screen.",10,0,0,24 February 2009
Up in the Air," Clooney at his absolute best.
","There are movies that deserve 10s and this one is on that list. Unique, funny and sad all wrapped up in a nice little travel package. A commentary on people and life seems to be what great movies possess and Up In The Air has those things. Though almost on the verge of a formula movie in the end, it manages to fly away from this glimmer of mediocrity to a deep sadness for the main character who accepts his decisions with wisps of kindness. From not quite as cocky of a person when the movie begins, to someone realizing their wrong assumptions and having to now live by those as time has passed him by. Clooney has forged himself into one of the great actors of the day with this movie and shows himself to possess an extraordinary amount of talent. He emits a charisma of proportion not found in any other actor today but manages it with a decorum. Except for some brief but graphic rear end shots(Though very shapely.) and language, the film might be OK for 16 or over.",10,0,3,12 April 2010
