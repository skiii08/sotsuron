The Ring," I don't know if I'd really call this movie 'scary' ... it was certainly suspenseful and interesting
","I don't know if I'd really call this movie 'scary' ... it was certainly suspenseful and interesting.  In fact, the premise was interesting enough to make me look into the story deeper than one should ... the plot is really holding together by a thread and shouldn't really be examined too closely. You get the feeling that all of the source material is there, but it was maybe chopped up a little too much in the editing room. Nonetheless it was a good Halloween night movie to watch ... better than 'The Others', not as good as 'The Sixth Sense'.",7,2,4,1 November 2003
Elf," Completely inoffensive, somewhat sappy, very funny movie
","This is a great Christmas movie done in the classic style (I was going to say 'old school' but I didn't want to get my Will Ferrell movies mixed up). I give Will Ferrell tons of credit for playing it straight and never once winking to the camera.   Good job by Jon Favreau for showing restraint and nodding to Christmas movie traditions. Completely inoffensive, somewhat sappy, very funny movie.",8,0,1,9 December 2003
Lost in Translation," I was expecting 'more'
","I think my expectations might have derailed this film for me a little bit. I was expecting 'more', but this film is really about subtlety and patience I wanted more Tokyo, more Bill Murray, more laughing.   But that's not this movie.  I do think it was a very plausible treatment of a relationship given the characters and the context.  I will definitely watch this movie again to give it another chance -- for now, I give it a 'good'.",7,0,0,26 January 2004
Ocean's Eleven," A great caper flick with fun performances
","This was the second time to see this movie, and it's just as cool as I remembered.  'Cool' and 'style' are really the two words that spring to mind when trying to describe this movie.  A great caper flick with fun (though maybe a little too self-aware) performances by Pitt and Clooney and the rest of the cast.",8,0,0,26 January 2004
8 Mile," Definitely better than it could have been, but this is no Purple Rain
","Definitely better than it could have been, but this is no Purple Rain. Eminem gives a passable performance, but the storyline is a little too fractured to be satisfying.  This film does do an effective job of portraying the depressing circumstances of growing up in poverty near Detroit.  Oh, the battle scenes were entertaining.",7,0,0,10 February 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," I put on my 'comic book violence'-colored glasses and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.
","Oh wow, it's a lot of fun to watch a Quentin Tarantino movie when he's at the top of his game like he is here.  I've read and heard quite a few reviews/opinions about this movie, and I can understand why it's a love-it-or-hate-it kind of thing: it all depends on your reaction to the violence and gore, which is the polarizing factor with this film.  I put on my 'comic book violence'-colored glasses and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.There are two things that QT did so right with both Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill: the use of music to create the perfect atmosphere, and his mastery of a non-linear presentation of the storyline.  First, the music: QT has an uncanny ability to bring a smile to your face (or make you cringe in the case of Reservior Dogs) simply by the music he chooses.  I don't know how he does it, but it's always *just* *right*.  From the opening credits of Pulp Fiction (with the changing of the radio stations) to the Nancy Sinatra tune and Mexi-Japanese songs in Kill Bill, it helps to create a memorable experience.  Second, the non-linear storyline.  While it's not used quite as effectively as Pulp Fiction, it's still effortless and entertaining.  I mean really, there's not much of a plot here, so it adds some interest, but the story is kind of besides the point.  It's a tribute to the genre with the QT spin on it.  Can't wait for Vol. 2.",10,0,1,19 November 2003
