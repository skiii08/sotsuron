The Expendables 2," Not sure if it was worse than the first one, does it matter?
","I don't know what it says about me that my very first review of a movie on IMDb is for The Expendables 2. But it was so lame, I had to post a review.I'm glad it was decided to throw in some younger actors, because looking at Stallone's drooping face in every other scene was depressing. And Chuck Norris, please, stop dying your beard.The action was so constant that it became boring. The dialog was stupid. No chemistry between any of the actors. In Arnold's scenes, he mostly stands and looks at the other actors who actually have lines.To make this movie work, it would have had to be much, much funnier. If they make another one of these, I hope they hire some comedy writers and find something funnier to say other than re-hashing the one liners from all the action stars previous movies.",1,2,3,2 December 2012
Black Snake Moan," For god's sake give her some pants.
","SPOILERS INCLUDED.I rented this movie back when it came out on DVD, probably sometime in 2008. And I happened to catch it the other night on TV, so I thought I'd watch it again.The first thing that came to mind when I re-watched this, is why in the hell didn't Samuel's character give the poor girl some pants. He's trying to cure her of her nymphomania, but leaves her practically naked so she's free to strip down and F poor unsuspecting visitors to his house while he's away and she's chained to his radiator.She gets beaten almost to death, and no one thinks to find out who did it? I mean sure, she's a slut, but that doesn't mean the beating was deserved. That never gets resolved other than Ronnie beating him up, not knowing what happened btw, so that's just for the audience I suppose.Then there's Ronnie, Justin's character. If he gets anxiety attacks, why is he joining the frickin' army???? He has a full-blown anxiety attack simply because he gets caught between two trucks on the highway. Ridiculous.Then the ending, oh holy hell. So the solution to all this turmoil, her nymphomania-caused-by-abuse and his severe anxiety, is to GET MARRIED??!! They drive away from Samuel's house and all is OK, until he has his traffic attack and she has a nympho attack and she forgets about it by consoling him. Then End.",1,2,9,18 March 2014
