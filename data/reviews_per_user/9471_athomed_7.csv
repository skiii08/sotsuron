Vertigo," Hired by an old friend, compelled by a new love, destroyed by his same old self
","I usually don't write reviews with spoilers. Vertigo is one of those films you just can't discuss without spoilers. The entire movie is a spoiler in that sense; detailing any portion of the plot can and will give away valuable information that first-time viewers shouldn't know. It's just that kind of movie.Alfred Hitchcock and James Stewart reunited after the success of Rear Window to make Vertigo. This would be their last collaboration together. Enough has been written already about the reasons for their film-making departure. We get to look back in retrospect and appreciate this movie for its greatness, and also with the knowledge that this was Hitchcock and Stewart's last hurrah together.I'm sure there are a million ways to interpret this film. A theme I find most interesting, nearest to my heart, is that of unrequited love.Midge's love for Scottie is foolish. She's loved him since college, even though he doesn't feel the same way. Scottie practically toys with Midge's affection for him during their scenes together. When Midge plays a joke on Scottie by painting the Portrait of Carlotta but replacing Carlotta's head with her own, Scottie abruptly leaves. She berates herself afterward with the ferocity, and the frustration, of a woman who's tried to gain Scottie's affection time and time again, only to fall short time and time again.Scottie's love for Madeleine is creepy; it's obsessive. When she's gone, he seeks out another woman just like her, not knowing they are in fact the same woman, though neither being the one he's after, and tries to make her into Madeleine. She can't love him because she's not real. His compulsion to create another Madeleine consumes every bit of humanity left in him.Judy's love for Scottie is hopeless. He doesn't love her. He loves a part she played. Like a man who marries an actress and then spends more time thinking about a role she played than the actual woman he married. She has every incentive not to fall in love with Scottie during her and Gavin's morbid gag, but she still does. Judy's love is so hopeless that she's willing to transform herself into Scottie's fantasy and play that part, the one that truly pleases him, for the rest of her life.Scottie finds himself on another ledge by the end of the film, he's licked his acrophobia, but at the expense of his humanity. The film comes full circle, as we consider how he spurned Midge in favor of Madeleine, and then couldn't return Judy's love because of his fixation on the dream woman who never existed. We're left to wonder, did Scottie ever love at all? Was he capable of love to begin with?",10,5,8,19 April 2012
Casablanca," Let's watch it again, Sam
","I consider myself an old film buff. There are plenty of pictures from the Golden Era which I appreciate; which satisfy me; which I can stand back and really marvel at. Casablanca is too close to my heart for that. This film is too special. Films like Casablanca or It's a Wonderful Life, the emotion is so red hot that they're still alive today. They make you believe. You could say watching Casablanca is like wrapping yourself in a comfortable blanket, but blankets wear out. It's really like actually spending 102 minutes at Rick's caf√© with the people you care about, whom you grow fonder of with each visit. That's Casablanca to me.",10,3,4,28 July 2012
Star Trek," This is a remake not a re-imagining.
","After finishing the movie it's clear that this movie isn't out to neglect the source material and completely create new characters. The creators of this movie took great care in giving Trekkie fans a nice Vulcan salute. This is a really great movie! I'm glad that Star Trek was put into the right hands. A disaster could have spelled disaster to a franchise very important to me and many, many others.Everything works out well in this movie. It has a fast pace. It's edited nicely. There's no time to waste scenes in this movie. This is also a very funny movie at some points. Especially a sick Kirk running around the ship with swollen hands and tongue while Bones is following him trying to cure him.This movie really doesn't disappoint. I can't wait for the next movie to come out. Walk into 'Star Trek 2009' with an open mind and you'll be glad you did.",8,3,8,15 January 2010
Iron Man 2," A fun watch but no Iron Man 1
","This movie has all the makings of an amazing superhero action movie in the league of The Dark Knight, Watchmen, and even the original Iron Man movie, but unfortunately it didn't live up to that expectation. Don't get me wrong, this movie was enjoyable start to finish but it didn't have the emotional punch of the other movies mentioned. Really there is no heart here, and never once does the movie require you to think.Without the great work of Robert Downey Jr. in the role he was meant to play, this would movie would lack charm as well. Iron Man 2 is close to two hours but seems to lose the time. Whiplash (Mickey Rourke), a truly great villain for Iron Man didn't have enough presence in the film. His final scene ended up feeling fairly corny.It's hard to express everything wrong with a movie like Iron Man 2 but there just wasn't any meat here. Gwyneth Paltrow who was terrific in the first Iron Man is only allowed to play one note here until the very end. She's the party pooper to Robert Downey Jr.'s perpetual party.Don Cheadle steps into Terrance Howard's shoes as Rhodey well enough but as with every relationship in this movie, the Cheadle and Downey Jr. story is underdeveloped. Scarlett Johansson plays Downey Jr's new assistant, hired on the spot. She adds some sex appeal to the cast, but again, it feels like we didn't see very much of her, and no bathing suit scene.The main problem I have with this movie is that we don't tread any new territory. It feels like this movie just had to be made because it was going to make a lot of money. I wanted an Iron Man 2, but one that was more engaging. Jon Favreau does all he can with the uninspiring script and plays 'Happy', comic relief and a bright spot in the movie.In the end, this is a light, fun sequel that still leaves a lot to be desired. It seemed to be filler left on the cutting room floor from Iron Man 1. Iron Man 2 will not be selected for preservation in the National Film Registry, but it's going to make a lot of money. Probably pass the 400 million domestically and maybe even scratch close to the 1 billion mark worldwide.",6,1,3,8 May 2010
Shutter Island," Great Scorsese.
","I've seen this movie twice now. This review is my opinion of the movie. Obviously I had no hand in the production. Nor can I read minds on what the makers did hope to show and/or accomplish with this motion picture. And it is a motion picture.One we've seen in different spaces and different places so many times before. We can relate the story to other templates we know. Troubled but capable man solves mystery. Then we find out he has a closer tie to the mystery than we originally imagined.The year is 1954. Teddy Daniels is a U.S. Marshal. His newest case is on an isolated island. A mental institution is housed within the Civil War era buildings. The mystery Teddy is here to solve is simple. A woman who drowned her kids escaped the prior night. It becomes more complicated when we learn that her cell was locked from the outside, and she left without even a pair of shoes. As Teddy muses 'We haven't heard the truth once yet.' Teddy is a WW2 veteran. He helped liberate the Dachau concentration camp. He killed a lot of people in the war. His wife, as we learn early, died in a fire. It was the smoke that got her, not the fire. The escape didn't take place at any regular institution. This is Aschliff Asylum for the criminally insane. These are the 'patients' that no other facility can handle. They've harmed or murdered before.Teddy's only friend is the partner he only met on the ferry onto the island, Chuck. Teddy trusts Chuck enough to let him know that he requested this case specifically. Teddy's wife didn't just die in a fire. It was arson. Andrew Laeddis, the man who set the fire. got away with it. He's finally sentenced to prison for burning down a school, but gets transferred to Ashcliff, then disappeared. Teddy is there to find him. Not to kill him. No. Teddy's had enough of killing. He wants to uncover what's really going at Ashcliff. Because prisoners don't just disappear, and Teddy's informant has told him of dangerous surgeries done in secrecy. Teddy is there to blow the lid off this place.Tortured dreams of his wife haunt his nights. But she's leading him. Telling him the arsonist is alive and somewhere on Shutter Island. Teddy saw things in the war. Horrible world-breaking things. He lost his wife.Shutter Island is his chance. From my own service overseas and the loss of loved ones in my life, Teddy's journey was mine. I want him to succeed so much. He's got a mystery here to solve and it's not an escaped patient. There's more going on. In the end Teddy can't succeed. There are two scenes in this movie that stand out as some of the best filmmaking has to offer. Teddy's first dream sequence and his conversation with the wonderful Jackie Earle Haley as George Noyce. In that scene, Noyce tells Teddy that he has to let go of his late wife or he'll never get off this island.I knew he wouldn't. I knew he couldn't. I know he'd spend the rest of his life on that island from the beginning. I know because I'm stuck on my own Shutter Island. I wish it really was as simple as finding Andrew Laeddis. I wish it were as simple as blowing the lid of the place. But as Teddy discovered, Andrew Laeddis is the last thing we want to find.",10,2,5,28 February 2011
It's a Wonderful Life," Few movies stay fresh forever. It's a Wonderful Life is in a very exclusive club
","It's hard to review a movie such as this. Everything worth saying about it has already been said. No words truly do it justice. It's one you have to sit down and watch. Every year without failure, millions of people plop down in front of the television to be spellbound by it.One only needs to refer to its ranking on the IMDb top 250 at #30 to see how well-regarded and beloved this classic is. It's one of those giants in film history that everyone needs to see.I wasn't introduced to this film by my parents like many were. In fact, I'm the one who instituted the policy that we must watch It's a Wonderful Life every December in my house growing up.This is the type of film which doesn't age. The themes and morals expressed in the film are the definition of timeless.I would strongly encourage anyone thinking of viewing this film to watch it in black and white. Some networks have aired the color version and the Blu-ray also contains the colorized version. The colorized version was not what the filmmakers and actors intended. Here's what James Stewart thought of the colorized version: 'I tried to look at the colorized version, but I had to switch it off--it made me feel sick.' James Stewart and Donna Reed are one of the best on-screen pairings I've ever seen. This isn't just a Christmas movie. It's every bit a romantic drama and explores some dark themes.Neither the director, Frank Capra, nor James Stewart knew what they had when this film was made. They hadn't discovered all the layers that existed within this movie. It took the viewing audience to find this classic on television for it gain the following it has today.We found it then and we do again every year.",10,1,2,24 December 2011
Zero Dark Thirty," The source material may lend itself to film, just not this one
","I should speak of the good things first. How many can there be if I only give this film a 3 out of 10? Not that many. I do think that Jessica Chastain (a new name to me) and Jason Clarke gave fine performances. Kathryn Bigelow's direction was only serviceable. I must confess to not being a fan of her past work.I'm sorry but it's time to get into the elements I disliked in the film already. Bigelow herself has stated that she saw this film as telling the story of the hunt for bin Laden, not fictionalizing nor judging, but leaving that to the audience. Such aspirations for a film about something still very personal and visceral to most Americans are hard to accomplish. More importantly, this comes with a certain responsibility. Such responsibility was not met.I find both halves of the film difficult to watch for different reasons. The first half because of its depiction of torture by CIA agents on the behalf of our country. The second half because it can get kind of boring. But let me stick to the first half. One positive thing I can say about the torture scenes is that no one, or at least, no one with an open, sensible mind can say that 'enhanced interrogation' is anything other than torture after watching this film. Arguments to the contrary always remind me of Nixon's response during one of those iconic David Frost interviews. 'Well when the President does it, that means that it is not illegal.' We've prosecuted and convicted people who employed water boarding on our own soldiers. To make the argument that water boarding is nothing more than 'enhanced interrogation' and entirely legal is really to make the point, 'Well when America does it, that means that it is not illegal.' The film does more than trip over its own feet when it suggests that a detainee gave up information upon the threat of more torture. No such occurrence took place. It's a fiction of torture's defenders and it's a fatal sin that the film would follow that direction. Another suggestion of the film, I'm sure at the benefit of making it more interesting, is that there were greater ties between the Camp Chapman attack and the hunt for bin Laden. This is another creation. This film fails to meet the expectations placed on it by Bigelow.I do think that Bigelow did a responsible job with the actual raid. It's quite accurate to most of the accounts an ordinary citizen like myself can get their hands on. However I will admit my frame of reference isn't as an ordinary citizen. As a former Ranger, I've had experience with high value targets. I believe the film was able to capture a piece of what an actual mission can feel like. I find this film to be a better representation of SEAL Team 6 than the recent HBO film Seal Team Six: The Raid on Osama bin Laden. That's the only takeaway for me.",3,40,83,10 January 2013
