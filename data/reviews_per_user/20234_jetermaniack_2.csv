Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not exactly Star Wars, but a decent film
","Episode I, in short, is not Star Wars. No X-Wings, Death Star, Darth Vader, Han Solo, or anything that has previously defined Star Wars. This is pretty much because the movie goes back to the old times - the Jedi are still existant, Obi-Wan is a mere Jedi apprentice, and the Galactic Republic, not the Empire, is in power. The story is mostly irrelevant to anything in ANH, ESB, or ROTJ. The plot delivers only two main things which factor into the original trilogy - the Sith is back, and a promising new Jedi (but Vader-to-be) is found - Anakin Skywalker. New characters are introduced, like the horribly annoying Gungan creature Jar Jar Binks. This guy is a disgrace to all things Star Wars - you wonder why he's even there in the first place. But there are many cool new characters and features, too. Sinister villain Darth Maul, the sleek Naboo Starfighter, and the completely sweet podracing are just a few. And Anakin is awesome.Die-hard fans might be disappointed about the lack of nostalgia, but there is enough eye-candy and other stuff to keep sci-fi and general movie fans pleased.",10,1,3,17 June 2002
The Incredibles," 'The Incredibles' lives up to its name
","I saw Pixar's latest on opening day and I saw it once again the day after. I say with no reservations that it was well worth it and just as entertaining (if not more so) the second time.The CGI film focuses on a family of superheroes trying to fit into conventional suburban life. But this is easier said than done as a threat from Mr. Incredible's past endangers he, his wife Elastigirl, and their kids Dash, Violet, and Jack-Jack.The animation is top-notch. The characters don't look very photo realistic like the humans in the Shrek films, but they're not supposed to be - it's a world with a cartoony, comic-book feel. Hair and cloth effects, lighting, and explosions are all accurately and intricately conveyed for a very immerse experience.There are laughs for both young and old alike, but the story is what really drives the film. The characters' motivations are well-developed, and the plot is creative. The average kid may actually find it a bit complex, in my opinion. It's a little more violent than I expected. Nothing graphic, but there's a lot of combat (your typical punch-and-kick fare) and deaths are implied. As usual, the best bet is to simply know your kid.I wish Samuel L. Jackson's character, Frozone, was in it more. But hey, you have to save some things for the sequel, right? That is, if Disney and Pixar can kiss and make up. How does 'The Incredibles' stack up to Pixar's other masterpieces? Well, it could very well be their best yet. The only one I might put before it is the classy laugh-riot that is 'Toy Story 2'. I guess time will tell, but if I had to choose right now, I'd put 'The Incredibles' in at #1.In the end, I think 'The Incredibles' really reminds me of what a blessing Pixar is. Few other studios have been able to make films that equally entertain both children and adults and actually have heart. All of these classics, in less than 10 years! I hope that Pixar will continue to make innovative animation, unforgettable characters, and great movies.10/10",10,0,1,6 November 2004
