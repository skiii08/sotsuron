Raiders of the Lost Ark," The ultimate adventure of all time!
","I don't care how illustrious 'Chariots of Fire' was back in 1981; 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' takes the cake every time! This is undeniably the best action picture that was ever created, with a hero that could take Seagal and Jackie Chan in a heartbeat. Seagal and Jackie may be formidable, but Indiana Jones has style and guts, and tackles Nazis and the supernatural to boot. Karen Allen as Marion is also one of the best heroines of the pack, no nonsense, no wimpy screaming, and not the first to yell for help; she can hold her own.I just recently saw 'Raiders' on the big screen for the first time (I'm only 20 years old) and I was blown over once again, no matter how many times I let it run through my VCR. It has a sense of humour without going slapstick, and has grit without becoming totally serious. The stunts are supreme, and (most importantly) the hero is not ashamed to show us he is exhausted, in pain, or can sweat. We are sweating right along with him. Spielberg and Lucas can not be praised enough for bringing archeology and history to this extreme wonder of entertainment. 'Raiders' is easily on my Top Ten list of all time.

As Good as It Gets," This comedy is as good as it gets!
","Comedies (especially romantic comedies) can only be judged by how much they make you laugh and if they make you feel good inside. As Good As It Gets does it for me every time. I'm not just saying this on account of being a 'Jack fan.' The characters are so beautifully drawn, you forget it's just Jamie from 'Mad About You' (Helen Hunt) and the man with the eyebrows (Nicholson). This movie deserved all of its Oscars, and then some. The role of an obsessive-compulsive is an easy one to parody and mock to death, but Jack does it with style, humour, emotion, and that usual Nicholson flair. Hunt has never been better as a waitress with a major anxiety to do something for herself for a change. Greg Kinnear is also very good as a gay artist that ends up having to turn to the irascible Jack for help after he is scarred and left destitute following a break-in. This is such a special comedy, fresh from the pen of James L. Brooks, the man behind the wonderful Terms of Endearment (another wonderful Nicholson performance) and Broadcast News. As Good As It Gets made me feel so good, even though I couldn't really relate to the characters' situations. The humor is pure Jack, set to the script with perfect ease. The emotions evoked by the actors are also authentic and heart-felt, as if they love what they are acting out. Movies like this come few and far between, and that is the reason why I appreciate this film so very much. As Good As It Gets was one of the best films of 1997.

Au Revoir les Enfants," One of the best foreign films I have ever seen!
","I will admit, I haven't seen a great deal of foreign films to compare with this, but regardless, this is one harrowing and satisfying film.  The portrayal of children during World War II is wonderful and heartfelt, and the storyline is drawn beautifully, directly from a child's perspective.  I loved the depressing ending of this film; it makes you think about how actions may seem inconsequential but are actually incriminating. This is one of the best of the year, a spectacular, creative triumph!",10,3,5,7 December 1998
Blade," Who cares about the plot; it looks really cool!
","This is one of those action movies that you don't care about the plot; the effects and visuals make it look really cool! Wesley Snipes does a great job as a vampire/human bounty hunter who hunts other vampires in vengeance for the death of his mother. Kris Kristofferson has a nice role as his comrade in the business. The blood and gore in this film will satisfy action and horror fans, being repulsive and fantastical. Stephen Dorff has a nice, villainous role as well. What I especially like about this flick is that extra information or comic book jargon is not necessary to get the gist of it. You can have fun with this, you can be shocked by this, but you never get sick of it. Blade sucks, but for all the right reasons. A nice job once again by Wesley Snipes!

North by Northwest," Top-notch suspense /adventure film still looks great after 40 years!
","For Christmas this year, I received my first to-own DVD: Hitchcock's classic, NORTH BY NORTHWEST. After over 40 years, this rip-racing adventure-thriller still packs a punch and looks great on widescreen. This movie came along during a renaissance period for the Old Master, between masterpieces like VERTIGO and PSYCHO, but this excursion into the world of suspense is so different from anything else Hitchcock had created up to that point. Never did he challenge our endurance to keep still in our seats for such a long period of time, and yet the film's 135 minutes go by so fast it could only be explained by movie magic itself.Cary Grant is one of those actors that a filmgoer either falls in love with or deeply envies. His debonair manner is displayed to the full in this film, even though the peril that his character goes through would cause any normal dude to break into a maddening sweat.  The dialogue Roger Thornhill delivers alongside Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) in this film is sometimes too hilarious to be true, but wouldn't any woman fall for it? (I'm merely guessing here)  Ernest Lehman's screenplay is so lighthearted and yet very ominous. With all the traps and pitfalls Grant goes through in this film, you would have to find comedy in it. Grant does and to great appeal. I absolutely love the sequence at the auction when Roger tries to get himself arrested by yelling out flaky bids and accusing the auctioneer of selling junk worth no more than $8.  I also admire the scenes with Saint on the train to Chicago; I was tempted to jot down some of his pick-up lines, but then I realized it's just a movie (or is it?)Hitchcock was famous throughout his career of setting up death-defying sequences with major landmarks as backdrops. Here, Mount Rushmore will never be looked at the same again afterwards. We may never enter the United Nations again without peering behind our backs for a notorious knife-thrower. And, I dare say, I will never walk alongside a highway where a cropduster could swoop at any minute. I love the line during the Rushmore incident when Grant says his two ex-wives left him because he lived too dull a life. Go figure!It has been said that Hitchcock's many films each contain a personal side of the director inside them. The archetypes of the Master of Suspense are here amid the chasing and running across the U.S. The mysterious blonde, played to a tee by Eva Marie Saint, is a common fixture of many Hitchcock jaunts. Saint joins Grace Kelly and Tippi Hedren in this feature. The protagonist is again awkward when faced with  the opposite sex, but unusually casual when wrapped up in danger. The hero has an attachment to his mother, continually under his nurturing wing. And of course, the macguffin has fun with us again (government secrets my foot!)Whenever I see action-packed epics today like 'The Fugitive' or the James Bond series, they all seem to quiver in comparison to this film. It amazes me that Hitchcock is able to hold the audience in the palm of his hand throughout the whole length of the journey. We become Grant as he runs away from the police and the secret agents who have chosen him as their dupe. But throughout the squabble, we sense that Grant is getting off on the whole jaunt, just as we want the chase to continue, not looking at our watches for a minute. However, it's fascinating to note that Roger Thornhill is not a born adventurer, nor is he an archeologist with a flair for escaping impossible situations. We are experiencing the Cary Grant in all of us, running away from an enemy we do not know they are or what they want. Is this symbolism of some kind? I say who cares; just watch the film and have fun!",10,193,268,25 December 2000
Aliens," Powerhouse sci-fi thriller that does not let go!
","Some films are just meant for the big screen and nothing else. ALIENS is one of these few treasures. I am a little tired of all this James Cameron bashing that has been going on since his Oscar cleanup and announcing his title of 'King of the world.' If I staked any kind of pursuit on something I believed in that badly, and won when everyone else said I would fail, I would be laughing all the way to the bank too. You see that creativity and gift for entertainment come alive in ALIENS. Cameron has an uncanny gift for making his films run for a considerable timeframe, and makes them thoroughly captivating and riveting throughout their duration, never stopping for a breath. Titanic is like that, and so is Aliens. Aliens, in its last hour, is non-stop action and suspense, using techno-visuals to a vast extent and more energy than it knows what to do with it. Sigourney Weaver is great as Ripley, a heroine that doesn't take any crap from anyone, and does everything a man can do, only better. She also has a heart, which is evident in her perserverance in saving Newt (Carrie Henn). Paul Reiser is devious and slimy as Burke, far from his character on 'Mad About You.' Bill Paxton is also a standout. If you have any brains at all, do not eat too heavily before seeing this film. You'll definitely not be able to hold it in. Rating: Three stars and a half.",8,0,0,22 February 1999
Legends of the Fall," Tremendous cinematography and good acting marred by shaky plot.
","It's always a shame when a film such as 'Legends of the Fall' looks so good and is so well produced, but its plot and its wholeness cannot measure up. Anthony Hopkins stars as the father of three sons: Alfred(Aidan Quinn), Tristan(Brad Pitt), and Samuel(Henry Thomas). They are a close-knit family without any degree of malice between them. When Samuel brings home a fiancee (the beautiful Julia Ormond), all three sons are enamored by her. With her arrival as well as the coming of World War One, the family is torn apart in shattering ways. The cinematography by John Toll is nothing but tremendous. Alberta's scenery has never looked better, even though it is being represented as Montana. The acting is first-rate, with Hopkins and Quinn standing out as the best of them. The major problems about this film is its grandiose form of storytelling. Some of these legendary plotlines might have worked during the fifties, but seem amazingly contrived today. It is not enough that Ormond has to be involved with one brother in the story, but has 'relations' with all three. Does she have no shame? The nomadic lifestyle of Pitt's character also goes overboard, with too much accent on the savage nature of the hunt. He even flaunts this behavior as a soldier, cutting his brother's heart out! Does he have no shame? I will admit I do enjoy a well-written soap opera in the movies. This one tries to be Shakespeare and fails miserably. I highly recommend this epic as a visual feast, but cannot condone some of the plot angles in this mediocre story. Note: Somebody please teach Brad Pitt how to be a credible actor!

Amadeus," AMADEUS is a triumph in delivering a biography wit...
","AMADEUS is a triumph in delivering a biography without the frills, all feeling and spirit, and no excessive druggie depression. F. Murray Abraham received a well-deserved Oscar for the role of the jealousy-ridden Salieri, with Tom Hulce in his finest role to date as the brilliant but childish Mozart. What is truly great about this 'music-bio'  is that there is no real hero to this story. Every character has the right to be hated or cheered for. Instead of glib facts, AMADEUS relies on human emotions to tell its tale, relating it with style, humour, mystery, and astonishment. This is truly one of the best films of 1984.",9,3,6,6 September 1998
The Piano," Magnificent, symbolic film masterpiece plays beautifully, like a piano.
","There are very few female directors in the film industry that have been given proper acknowledgment or had their works introduced to mainstream filmgoers. Jane Campion is one of these precious few, a director who carefully paces and sculpts her works so that they magnificently flow like a musical interlude. 'The Piano' is her ultimate masterpiece, a film of such simplicity, described with calm and tense complexity. Holly Hunter received an Oscar for her fascinating performance as Ada, a mute woman who is forced into an arranged marriage with a New Zealand landowner, played convincingly by Sam Neill, a native Australian actor himself. Ada journeys to New Zealand with her young daughter (Anna Paquin, also an Oscar-winner that year), few other possessions, and her treasured piano, a part of her that amplifies her voice that she cannot express through vocal communication.I believe it would be wrong to assume that any of the characters are martyrs in this tragic story, nor would it be right to think Sam Neill's character a villain. You may think this is crazy, but I think the piano itself serves as both a good and bad omen for all that are involved. I would relate it to a 'Pandora's box' of sorts, a treasure that exposes all the evil and sin in the world, but which also provides hope as well. The piano is Ada's sounding box, a tool that allows her to escape from a world that does not understand her, but that also threatens her moral compass, removing her from marital conventions and forces her to lose herself.The performances in 'The Piano' are particularly good, especially Holly Hunter's. It is interesting to note that all of Hunter's piano playing in the film is actually Hunter herself performing in front of us. You can visually and aurally feel the mood of Hunter's character through the music she plays. We the audience lose ourselves right along with her, lost upon a sea of music. We see why Keitel becomes enamored by her, and why Neill becomes overcome with jealousy and betrayal. Not many films would allow us to enter the emotions of all three main characters, but this film is truly an exception.Rarely do we witness real beauty captured on film. 'The Piano' is such a visually stunning film, it's almost intoxicating how its atmosphere sweeps across the screen. This landscape is equaled by the performances, bringing understanding and mystery to this wonder. Sometimes symbolism of this nature can be distracting to an audience. 'The Piano' dares to follow this symbolic path, and hits a bullseye with full emotional force. Rating: Four stars.",Null,79,117,27 June 1999
Pulp Fiction," Dialogue shines in this creative bloodbath, but where's the potatoes?
","If Pulp Fiction is going to be remembered for anything one hundred years from now, it will definitely be for the unique intellectual conversations John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson engage in before they blast their next assignment. It will also be memorable for bringing Travolta back to Hollywood with a bang (pardon the pun). I even might recall such terms as 'dead n***** storage' and 'Royale with cheese.' The only thing I cannot understand is where there is enough genius or wonder about this film to declare it as one of the top 100 best films from the AFI. I'm not arguing that Pulp Fiction is not a terribly original and thoughtful trilogy, but why the huge amount of critical hype? (And by the way, I prefer to call it a Quarter Pounder with cheese.) Rating: Three stars.",8,0,0,14 June 1999
The Lion King," Animated adventure that is a treat for the eyes and the heart!
","I will admit it, I do not immediately run out when Disney or any other company puts out its latest animated feature. It's just not the fare I indulge in often. If I had it to do over again, I would gladly race to the theater to see 'The Lion King,' a wonderful and moving family film from Disney. Never have I seen an animated film so vibrant and visually stunning. On top of that, the story is not what I'd consider a kiddie fest. The tale of Simba as he discovers his place in the 'circle of life' is heartwarming and almost realistic. Could celebrity voices ever be more suitably matched with animated characters? James Earl Jones is fabulous as Mufasa, the king of the jungle, and Jeremy Irons is devilishly villainous as Scar, the jealous brother who longs to take Mufasa's place as king. Whoopi Goldberg is also a surprise in what I believe is the first time she has played a bad guy.  This is definitely one of the best films of 1994, and possibly one of the top three best animated adventures from the Disney studios. Cartoons can truly have a life of their own. Rating: Four stars.",Null,0,0,23 June 1999
Casino," Scorsese strikes again with as much punch as Goodfellas.
","I will admit that I do have my qualms with Martin Scorsese on a few levels. Sue me, I was not totally blown over by Raging Bull and The King of Comedy was a little too zany for my satisfaction. Goodfellas, however, really impressed me, and Casino, following in the same tradition as Goodfellas, scores big time as well. Like Goodfellas, it knows how to tell an intriguing story, makes its characters complex, and does not establish any heroes within its cast. The actors work remarkably well as an ensemble, not letting either of the three be the star, and displaying reality and charisma to their roles without becoming campy.Casino works in the same way as The Godfather did, telling a fascinating tale of the mob, murder, corruption, and power. It does not give us anything that we don't want, having spectacular camerawork in the traditional Scorsese fashion, but not removing anything from the actual story. Going against what some have stipulated, De Niro and Pesci do not reprise their parts from Goodfellas; these characters have their own meat and style to them. Casino reminded me of the reason why I love movies; hopefully Scorsese will continue in the same tradition as this in the future, and not jerk me around like he sometimes does. Casino is one of the best films of 1995. Rating: Four stars.",Null,1,1,13 March 1999
The Thin Red Line," Seems to be brilliant, but does not cross the 'red line' of focus.
","Every once in a while, there comes a movie that seems to be absolutely brilliant, even amazingly original, and you get kind of ticked off when that brilliance passes you by. Stanley Kubrick's works always seemed to do that for me, along with a few other 'artistic' titles that come to mind. It's almost eerie that Kubrick just passed away recently, because 'The Thin Red Line' seemed to me to resemble something which Kubrick might have presided over. There are many fascinating sequences and exhilarating spots of cinematography in this new installment of the World War II genre, but a lot of tedious, meandering sequences and a combination of disorganized messages that drift into others, seriously clutter up the story. I could never fully understand what the movie was trying to tell me that was supposed to be the main message of the whole plot. The plot itself passes like a ship on an unpredictable sea, sometimes torrential in its action and suspense but also needlessly dry in other moments. If Terrence Malick's 'masterpiece' has one major problem that I can definitely pinpoint, it would probably be its excruciating length. If it ran maybe 45-60 minutes shorter in duration, it might have worked as a tight and alarming picture of war. Instead, it dances around a lot of different meanings and areas of entertainment, from the deeply poetic to the engagingly violent and mysterious. I would like to point out one great performance of the film before I depart. Nick Nolte is one of those actors that takes his time between projects, but always turns out an interesting, if not always likable, character. His work in this entry is just great, a three-dimensional role that receives too little screen time. Call 'The Thin Red Line' an epic that is reaching for brilliance and is grasping way too far. Go see 'Saving Private Ryan' instead, and get a point and great dramatic strength, something in which 'Red Line' falls a tad short. Rating: Two stars and a half.",Null,0,0,5 July 1999
Braveheart," Magnificent moviemaking of medieval times; Mel Gibson deserves Oscar!
","Very few film directors can thoroughly entertain us with historical epics. Spielberg and Lean come to mind. Now, Mel Gibson can be added to this prestigious list of names. BRAVEHEART is easily one of the best films of 1995. Watching it, you really get a sense of what movies are all about. I've always thought Mel has had a flair for giving audiences what they want. Even when he was working in Australia, doing such projects as The Bounty and the Mad Max films, I knew there was a creative genius behind those great and under-rated performances. His work in BRAVEHEART is exactly what I had in mind. This is truly a labor of love for Mel, showing real pride in the quality of his craft. I loved the power of this film, emotionally and visually. William Wallace is a savage, but he always represents what he consistently stands to achieve: love, happiness, and most importantly, freedom. You can feel the majesty of the story, weaving Shakespearean edges within it without making it seem like it was made for a privileged few. Patrick McGoohan, who got gipped for an Oscar nod, is brilliant as King Edward, despicable in a collected demeanor. There is even a sense of humour to boot in this epic, bringing a bit of Scottish wit to an intensely serious and bloody carnage of a film. In this regard, I would compare it to Shakespeare. The attention to detail, the emotion, the power of BRAVEHEART prove Mel Gibson definitely has a flair for genius and a gift for entertaining the public. This is not to be missed! Rating: Four stars.",10,2,3,23 February 1999
The Breakfast Club," Ultimate teen film still packs a punch today; Brat Pack lives on!
","I vividly recall growing up in the '80's. One of my pastimes was soaking up the culture of the age. Video and film were key parts of this culture. The thing was you didn't care whether they were Oscar material, you just had a good time. This film however, THE BREAKFAST CLUB, is one of the more serious films of the age, and I think one of the best. Even though the Brat Pack did not rage on with their careers after the eighties, they undoubtedly had talent, and they certainly display it in this play-like setting. It takes a different kind of skill to perform in these types of atmospheres, but all of them handle it very well. Judd Nelson may be a sort of a scene-stealer (and he does do it well), but the whole cast plays their part to the mark. I found it odd that I didn't play favorites with the characters. Each one had a past to tell, and a captivating one, too. This is not your traditional John Hughes fare with bumbling burglars and vacations that get out of control. This is deeper material with deeper character sketches. This is a rare teen comedy that delivers more than you expect. Rating: Three stars and a half.",Null,0,1,27 February 1999
Born on the Fourth of July," Oliver Stone strikes again with his best work to date.
","I know Oliver Stone has taken a lot of flack from historians and others in the know for his controversial pieces on American culture, but this time, he relies on the feelings of a real Vietnam veteran who has a change of heart about what is the American way. Tom Cruise, in his best acting job yet, plays Ron Kovic, a young man who enters Vietnam with more American spirit than you could ask for, but discovers the horror behind the patriotism. Stone, however, does not really concentrate on Vietnam, but rather on the disillusionment of Kovic after he returns to the homefront. The power of the Cruise performance will not easily be forgotten, told with emotion and strength. The images are incredible as well, exhilarating and haunting, a beautiful counterpoint of American triumph and the terror of Vietnam and its anti-demonstrators. Stone's last film, Platoon, didn't work as well for me because it seemed to have a point but kept disguising it with a lot of hoopla. Born on the Fourth of July has a major point, and represents it extraordinarily. This was one of 1989's best films (if not the best). Rating: Four stars.",Null,1,2,7 March 1999
From Here to Eternity," GREAT AMERICAN FILM WITH GREAT AMERICAN ETHICS

THIS MOVIE DESERVES THE RIGHT TO BE CONSIDERED ONE OF THE BEST AMERICAN FILMS OF ALL TIME.",Null,1,2,19 September 1998
