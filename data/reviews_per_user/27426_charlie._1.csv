Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Excellent.
","Overall, 'The Phantom Menace' is not the strongest installment in the StarWars saga. But just as well, it rates as a fun movie. When the new trilogy is complete, it will be interesting to see what type of pedestal this movie will be placed on. My hope would be that of a positive one. It sets the characters up very nicely for the next two movies. The movie could have used a lot less JarJar. Most of the JarJar slapstick/site gags felt too beneath Star Wars. Ewan makes the perfect Obi-Wan and Lian Neeson turns in a superb performance as rogue Jedi Master, Qui-Gon Jinn. As I've said before, Ian McDiarmid has captivating screen presence in his dual role. Natalie Portman does very nice in another dual role. Ray Park is vile and menacing and for the most part...mute. But the man is still a bad-ass. Pernilla August brings the movie some acting credibility with her take on Anakin's mother. Jake Lloyd turns in a decent enough performance as James Earl Jones...er, Anakin Skywalker. The special effects were top-notch all the way. My friend had some differing opinions on that, but does it really matter? THE BATTLE DROIDS KICK ASS! Sorry if I hurt anyone's ears... Of course, the only true way to understand this movie is not through some half-assed plot summary (i.e - all of the above) but to see the film for yourself.",Null,0,0,30 June 1999
