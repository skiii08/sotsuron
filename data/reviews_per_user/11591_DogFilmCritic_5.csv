The Ring," Why do I enjoy this movie so much
","The ring a remake done right, in the root of the death of a niece, Rachel ( Naomi Watts) investigates the story behind a mysterious and cursed videotape, which causes death in seven days of those who have seen it. The cursed objects are something that have been in the history of humanity since forever from jewelry, dolls,cars ,houses etc. fiscal objects created to torment the unfortunate who encounter them, the idea of ​​a videotape so accessible and habitual in our modern lives that passes unnoticed and harmless arousing the curiosity to see whats taped inside, a kind of curse attached to whoever puts it, is equally fascinating as terrible and at the time quite original.Gore Verbinski is truly a master of suspense, It doesn't rely on jump scares (and those that are there are rear but very effective), and it has some truly disturbing imagery that is not just filmed at random, but carefully chosen to mess with your head. It's nearly subconscious in how it consistently disturbs you. It's truly an example of great horror direction.﻿ I could make a list of bad examples but just using One Missed Call is enough, the U.S. remake ( it was terrible and completely missed the point ).﻿ It takes time, skill and effort to make film stand out specially in the horror genre.There's supposed to be a parallel between the two children (Aiden and Samara) Aiden is supposed to mirror Samara and some sort of psychic connection betwee them. The overall theme of the story is parental neglect. At the start Rachael is a somewhat negligent parent and is ignoring her sons emotional problems. By the end she's shown taking more interest in him after learning about Samara and her backstory.Also, the twist isn't that Samara is purely evil, it's that she wants to spread her story to everyone who dares to watch the video, to experience her suffer. The thing that makes this movie so complex is they had to keep a balance between Samara being sympathetic and menacing at the same time thus making her a tormentor, is a horror film after all, and she is the villain no matter if she is a little girl making her a more disturbing foe ,If they made it explicit that Samara's visions were just from her death (and hence not of her making) then that makes her too much the victim, and would detract from the terror of her climactic scene. Overall the film is worth the watch, the camera lenses used a sea water color giving the movie a cold vibe. I definitely recommend it as a horror movie with great acting and a solid story to keep you on your sit.",8,1,1,20 February 2017
Green Room," Pretty disturbing pretty amazing
","After I saw Blue Ruin I wanted to see more of Jeremy Saulnier his work is very simply and realistic making it for some fine cinema, never underestimate simple storytelling. It feels very real, to sum it people being monsters to other people making it as shocking and intense as possible. To add more realism there wasn't any CGI blood, everything was special makeup that looked very real and gory, the way things are done you can feel disturbed you know this group are in a living nightmare and it keeps getting worst as it progresses, their trapped with no were to hide, all the sequences in the movie are very intense and the characters look and feel very authentic, forget about the stereotypical individuals in horror movies, this is way different and watching it you will know their decisions make perfect sense.This is worth the watch.",8,4,9,18 July 2016
Sinister," A brilliant horror film
","I love this movie from start to finish, there are few times when the horror genre give us a great movie like this, horror genre is a very wide subject,from monsters, slashers, ghosts, aliens, zombies,etc there's a lot to work with but an extraordinary story always comes with high expectations from the viewer,i personally am very skeptical with horror movies,i just cant stand jump scares, to me putting a jump scare in a film is a desperate attempt to gain notability in there scenes,with Sinister you get a dark tone story with psychological fear elements around it, one of the most impressive thing of this movie to me was its sound track, if you listened to it closely it doesn't belong to your typical scary movie, i highly recommend you listen to it and try to relate it to a scary movie, to me it works perfectly it helps you merge onto the scenes without saying that you're watching a scary movie.What i like about it so much is as you go along it starts to get more mysterious, and our main character gets sucked into it, he is an everyday man and that helps a lot to the story, you can relate to him in a way, it doesn't feel generic at all,so what makes this movie so great,the strength of this movie was the scary elements like i said before the mystery in the movie, and how it affects the main character thew out the film,it does well in building up the suspense then lets us back down to a level of an average family drama,then picks up making it more intense as we move along,its worth watching it using a keen eye for the details around it it one of my favorite films today and i always recommend it to people that are looking for a well made film rather tan an easy scare",9,0,1,18 February 2015
The Fly," A Classic
","If your a horror fan it's impossible to miss this movie, every horror director should watch and re watch this movie, to me besides the amazing makeup effects it's the human emotions in it, you can see it as a love one going threw a disease it heartbreaking to watch specially with Goldbloom and Davis chemistry.That is what makes this movie so haunting it's how human it is, you feel bad for Goldbloom as he slowly deteriorates into a monster as he looses touch with humanity and the fly starts to take over him and Davis knows she can't do anything about it. I highly recommend this movie is a emotional ride from start to finish and the special effects are a plus and believe me after watching this movie you will want for practical effects to come back.",8,1,2,18 July 2016
The Blind Side," Praising Sandra Bullock
","It's a fact that Sandra Bullock is a box office star but I never saw her as an Oscar contender nor as a winner, don't get me wrong she is good but she is a Ron con queen not know as versatile actress, people love her and will see her in anything she is in and giving her Oscar credibility even better. To me this is the only reason she won so big name studios made her a cash cow, no matter what she dose she will fill their pockets, and honestly this movie is no different.If you saw the trailer you seen the movie...at least an hour into it I mean there are no surprises in it, it's not that interesting either. Being honest almost no one knows who Michael Oher is, this movie is focused to make Sandra Bullock look good, besides her real life counter part looks nothing like Bullock in real life she is not near as attractive as Sandra is in the movie. What I can say good about it is that Bullock plays a genuine Christian who actually dose what the bible says we should do, and if the undertone of this movie is we should help other well I'm cool with that, but the problem with this movie is there is no real conflict other that having this kid get good grades so he can play football, if you think it was when he was applying for collage and he was interrogated on why this people were helping him and influence him to go to this particular collage and by that point the movie is almost over...SO WHAT nobody watching this movie is convince on that fact it's not like we get the ACTUAL story anyways, you can ask if he was skinny and weak would Bullock would pick him up...don't know and probably will never get the straight answer.I don't think she deserves the Oscar well maybe just maybe for Gravity but not for this movie.",5,1,2,21 September 2016
