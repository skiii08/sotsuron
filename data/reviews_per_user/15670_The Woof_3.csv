The Blair Witch Project," Shot on a small budget, this movie proves you don't need the big bucks to work...
","This movie, recently released on VHS and DVD was a great thrill to see in a theater.  The fact that it was shot with so little money didn't detract from the effect that this flick had.  I too, was caught up in the 'dread' of what is going to happen next.  It was nice to see a 'horror' genre film go for a bloodless bath.Shot with different types of cameras, and using black and white and color sequences spliced throughout, the director presented us with a feel for an 'on the spot' documentary look.  The Actors, also caught up in the effect, provided very real and intense emotions throughout the whole experience.Many people have either loved or hated this film based only the 'jiggling' effects of the Video portions of the movie, but I think that added to the 'documentary' style with which they tried to present this affair.  Once one was accustomed to how they were presenting the film this should not have caused a problem.It was nice to feel scared in a Cinema again, and it only took a budget of about 25,000 dollars plus my 6 dollar matinee ticket to do it.  So much for those big budgeted events.....Now that this movie has been out and has been seen by a swarm of people, I am sure this release on Video will provide it with still more astonishing feats.For all of you DVD Fans out there.  I highly recommend it.  The look, and the sound are intense.  The added features on the DVD also make this a plus.",Null,0,1,23 October 1999
Sleepy Hollow," The story is not the best, but the style and look make it a must see...
","I am a fan of Tim Burton.  His new film, Sleepy Hollow, is another in a line of quirky, and eerie, worlds that this director is fond of creating.Using equally quirky and talented actors, Johnny Depp, and Christina Ricci, he creates another beautifully dark, yet rich textured landscape upon which to tell his tale.Though not adhering to the tale by Washington Irivng strictly, he uses the elements from that story to weave a more dark and sinister story of our famous 'Headless Horseman'.  Depp plays Icabod Crane, and Ricci plays the love interest, Katrina Van Tassle.I thought that Burton smartly created a very moody and very effective canvas on which to paint.  The story, or the actors aren't necessarily the stars here.  What you 'see' on screen is the star.  No house seems to have a right angle, no sunlight seems to ever shine, in the town you feel dread, outside of town, it looks like a painting.  Rich texture and some neatly made computer graphics create quite a world.If you are a fan of Burton, see the movie, it is worth it.  If you are not, I still think it is worth a look.  You might be surprised by what you see.",7,0,0,20 November 1999
American Beauty," One of my faves of the year...simply great.
","This movie was a joy to watch.  I didn't know what to expect when I came into it.  I had heard the buzz of the acting and the story, etc...but we've all heard that before and had been disappointed, but not so with this one.Kevin Spacey plays this part to a 'T'.  He is strong when it requires and meek when it is needed.  His emotional rollercoaster ride is a trip to partake in. Annette Bening is marvelous as well.  I think they both should be nominated.The support cast is also spectacular.  Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari all give great performances as the troubled 'Teenagers' in the film. Of particular mention is Wes Bentley's performance, worthy of a supporting nomination as well.This is a dramatic and funny tale of a man and his life in a state of turmoil and transition.  When he happens to see a beautiful friend of his daughter's at a cheerleading exhibition, he is completely infatuated with her beauty.  Using this as his inspiration, he attempts to change all aspects of his life.  He confronts his marriage, his job, his ego, and his libido.The music in this film is also very well chosen.  There are moments when the music fits so perfectly with the scene that they meld together as one to present a perfect emotion.The plot can get rather involved, but you will follow it endlessly to see where you go.  I was simply involved, hook, line and sinker.See this movie more than once, and skip some of the other movies out now that are dare I say, trash.This should be on the top of many critic's lists this year and it is certainly on top of mine.My Rating (1 - 10):  10",10,242,319,5 November 1999
