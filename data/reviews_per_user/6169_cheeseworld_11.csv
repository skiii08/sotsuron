The Incredible Hulk," Incredible terrible.
","Poor story, nothing interesting but the last fight scene.Edward Norton in a film with poor dialogue doesn't stick well, the character was weak, no strong interaction with nothing, completely understand why he didn't like the film after completion.Poor casting. William Hurt acting was terrible, all the yelling was painful to watch. Tim Roth wasn't a good fit.",1,1,5,1 November 2018
Child 44," Movie is trash, it honestly should have a different title.
","Only good thing about this movie is the acting which is Great.Movie really doesn't focus on the murder of the children, it mainly focuses on Leo and his wife problem with the Russian Embassy. Movie should have a different title, even if the title is changed to fit the movie, its still trash.",1,0,7,30 November 2017
Iron Man 2," Get rid of one character? Add more to the main story.
","Jack Hammer shouldn't of been a main character in this film.Your main plot is, Ivan wants to get revenge by killing Tony for what Tony's father done to his father.The story itself was weak, but what made it even worse, Jack Hammer's trash subplot completely outshined it to the point you no longer worried about the main plot or completely forgot about it.Sorry, movie is trash.",1,0,0,9 December 2018
Point Break," Never call me, never email ever if this writer or director puts out another movie.
","Before I start, what director was dumb enough to accept this script, (Notice I didn't put a question mark, cause I don't want to know his or her name). I hated Bodhi speeches to Utah. I ignored the terrible acting.Almost cut this movie off the first 4min, that stunt where they jump the dirt ramp was terrible. There is a pointless fight scene in this underground place with Bodhi, and Utah. Samsara character served no purpose in this film.The point of the crimes is so stupid, even if so, they should have showed Bodhi, and his crew being more detailed in their crimes, more schemes, more plotting etc.",1,1,1,29 April 2018
Ready Player One," No I was not ready for this player trash
","Where was the contest?It was more of a journey, not competition. Sorrento wants to destroy wade's avatar, then he wants Wade to help him find the egg, Wade doesn't agree, so Sorrento tries to kill him. Sorrento kidnaps Samantha, then blah blah blah blah happens. I just would've preferred to watch a real contest for the egg.",1,0,1,7 July 2018
"I, Robot"," This movie had a dumb idea.
","Reading what the movie is about, or watching the trailer you will want to see it, but when you actually watch the movie and find out what the real plot is, you'll realize it's the dumbest plot.Viki, which is the supercomputer, started to think for itself, and corrupt the robots for its own use. Viki got too concerned with the safety of humans, so it programmed the robots to not listen to them. (This is so stupid)You mean to tell me, Viki was so concerned about the safety of humans that it decided to corrupt the robots to control humanity. (Breathe, never mind)Dr. Lanning knew what Viki was up to, so he comes up with the dumbest idea to program a robot (Sunny) and have it kill him so he could leave clues behind revealing Viki's plan to detective Spooner (This is dumb)It just doesn't stop. You mean to tell me he killed himself in order to leave clues behind. I'm done with this topic, don't even want to talk about the other stuff.",1,1,3,31 July 2018
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Mission imterrible.
","The pacing was too fast in this movie. Weak story told.1. Pointless beginning, it seemed as though it was just there to show Ethan hanging on the plan.2. Lane character is so trash, we see him do nothing in the film.3. We see the syndicate do nothing4. Nevermind.",1,1,6,26 August 2018
Mission: Impossible," Movie was 'not really'
","That which I did like. Hacking into the CIA Rope scene was awesome, it was very quite, and suspenseful, definitely his best stunt scene out of all mission impossible movies so far.What I didn't like was that it had obvious clues that Krieger was the one who killed Golitsyn, and Sarah. 1st clue: CIA infiltration scene, the knife is shown when Hunt stops him from killing the security guard. 2nd clue: When Hunt goes back up to the ventilation shaft, Krieger drops the Knife on the desk. The ending scene was very weak also.Movie should of had more to it, with a bit more action.Jon Voight acting was great, but I would of preferred someone else. Brian De Palma great director, but I don't think this genre was good for him to do at the time. I'm pretty sure had he got a chance to make one during this time, it would be much better.",3,1,2,3 August 2018
Thor," Loki deceiving plans failed, but were great.
","Loki breaks the Frost Giants into Asgard to take the Casket Of Ancient Winters, the Giants fail at their attempt. Thor ask his father Odin to take action, but he doesn't allow it. Loki suggest that Thor goes to Jotunheim to take action, knowing this can ruin his changes of becoming King.
Back at Asgard, Odin strips Thor of his powers for disobeying, then cast him on Earth. Odin gets ill then falls into the Odin Sleep, Loki takes charge as King.Loki sneaks the Frost Giants back into Asgard along with their leader Laufey to kill Odin while sleep, and take the Casket of Ancient Winters back home, Loki tricks and kills Laufey, then tries to destroy an entire race of Frost Giants, but Thor gains his powers back returns to Asgard and stops him.Odin wakes from his sleep, Loki hoping that he'd be proud of what he's done showing that he is worthy of being King, Odin disagrees, Loki saddened, vanishes into the realm.",9,0,0,16 December 2018
American Made," OMG! Movie Really could of been great.
","First things first Tom Cruise did a great Job acting.The film doesn't have enough about the C.I.A, FBI, and DEA. CIA: Besides Seal dropping stuff off, and gaining intel for them, it doesn't explain in clear enough detail how they interacted with the other countries.Major problem this film has is 'popping up with information'Something as simple as it showing how Schafer knew that Seal was smuggling cigars for the Cuban exiles, it didn't explain how he knew. The FBI, and the DEA were just appearing with information, it should of showed their investigations.",1,4,10,2 May 2018
Iron Man," I have an issue.
","My question that I need an answer for that doesn't make any sense to me:Raza wanted Stark to make him a Jericho missile, what sense did that make if weapons were being dealed to him illegally by Stan who was giving Raza and other countries Stark weapons?Let me explain why that question is asked...When Tony goes back to Afghanistan to save the people of a village and to destroy his weapons, one of the weapons he destroys is 'the Jericho.' So as we can see, Raza ended up getting the Jericho missile anyway, so what sense did it make when he kidnapped Stark to ask him to build the Jericho missile if he was able to get it anyway?",6,1,1,31 October 2018
