Requiem for a Dream," Not a film about drugs after all
","I must agree with dorcula: this is not a film about drugs nor addictions. It's a film about how we create dreams to fulfil our existential holes, and how those dreams broke...Saying that, the film is really amazing. Some people complains about its cinematography, but it think there could not be better applied in a film with such a story to tell. The subjective cameras, editing and other visual effects are so impressive that I can only compare them with the revolutionary way in which Welles filmed Citizen Kane in his time.The actors are great, with Ellen Burstyn in a superb interpretation. The score is also amazing. The last twenty minutes are the most shocked I've even seen in a screen... I can only recommend this film as a master piece, but it's also a film not for everyone. Dark and disgusting. It's the new millennium first drama (well, it was done in the last one, I know), and I won't be surprise if in a few years it becomes a cult movie.",9,0,0,9 July 2001
