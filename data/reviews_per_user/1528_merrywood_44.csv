The New World," An extraordinary filmic experience.
","We know enough about British adventurer-explorer John Smith (who later named the region where I now live, New England) one of central figures in the Jamestown Colony of Virginia to understand how Terrence 'Sparky' Malick was inspired to write and direct this movie. It follows the story of how Captain John Smith, then 26 (in 1606) was captured by the aboriginal people of Virginia and whose life was saved by the chieftain's preteen daughter. Pocahontas. Malick is not a light-weight filmmaker (DAYS OF HEAVEN, THE THIN RED LINE) but he is an indulgent one. THE NEW WORLD is a meditative Tone Poem (yes, I know, this nomenclature belongs to music) the only appropriate term that comes to mind. It has polarized critics and audiences as well. The film really belongs to an earlier period perhaps before the invention of television. It has been called 'elegiac' by some critics who have swooned over it. I tend to agree. It is all at once, the aforementioned symphonic poem, a composition in one movement and a tender, crushingly moving love story that touches its audience deeply but does not leave marks. The nature of true love and life is both observed and reflected upon. The background tableau is essentially the natural world preexisting the European intrusion into the Western Hemisphere. In this environment Malick has been able to simplify the phenomenon of love and examine it in a wonderful light.If I were a critic I would say that the film can use some cutting. We revisit Malick's pastoral visions more than once too many times. All that said, this is a very unusual experience in film. Its photography is magnificent and the music score exquisite. Perhaps it's one that we badly need in this our day of overwhelmingly chaotic, rapid-fire, synthetic life. Highly recommended!",8,3,7,3 February 2006
The Ring," A jolly time for masochists!
","Despite a fine performance by Naomi Watts and other cast members, including a much welcomed, albeit far too brief appearance by Jane Alexander, this contrived, slick production can easily be called the rich man's 'Blair Witch Project'.   An artifice throughout, the story line follows a reporter's investigation of what appears to be a high-tech haunting replete with French-'New Wave'-styled, nonsense in a linear fashion then falters at the end when it reveals itself to be an unresolved exercise in meaningless destruction, pain, abuse and overall negative values. 
	If being manipulated by contrived quick cuts, sudden loud sounds and an ultimately inexplicable and malicious list of deaths is your cup of tea this is for you.  For those who prefer a more popular form of entertainment, let this one pass and allow it to return to the dark corner of the Dumpster behind the building from whence it came.	Supposedly a cerebral exercise: that, it is not.  Appointment in Samara, indeed.",2,1,2,30 October 2002
Finding Neverland," The Wings of Imagination
","The real J.M. Barrie was influenced and inspired as a child in Scotland by the adventurous stories of Robert Louis Stevenson of pirates, Indians and kidnapped boys. As a young journalist in London in the peak years of the Gilded Age his vivid imagination took him from novels to stage-plays. Barrie loved games and founded a cricket club with fellow writers Arthur Conan Doyle and P.G. Wodehouse. An old nugget describing his personality tells of his comments upon himself and others that often appeared in the newspapers. He once remarked to H.G. Wells, 'It is all very well to be able to write books, but can you wiggle your ears?' It was in the very early years of the 20th Century, now 101 years ago and the same year that in the windy Outer Banks of North Carolina that the Wright Brothers took flight that Jamie Barrie's Peter Pan soared into the air on wires in the London stage. Marc Forester's fascinating film biography adapted by David Magee from Allan Knee's play, 'The Man Who Was Peter Pan,' now comes to us in this delightful, moving account, 'Finding Neverland.' It presents historical reality between lushly imagined expeditions to a fictitious Neverland. It's performed impeccably by Johnny Depp as Sir James Mathew Barrie and an extraordinary cast under the able direction of Marc Forster.This is the loveliest film of the year, highly recommended. Bring Kleenex for the final scenes and see how difficult it is to leave the theater and return to today.",10,187,236,2 December 2004
Citizen Kane," Citizen ChiKANEry
","In the early '70s Citizen Kane became the darling of some NYU film addict class instructors for reasons that defy logic. They wrote papers and articles and that caused a lot of shallow folks to come aboard on the film. However closely examined the movie is greatly overrated. The script is not really one of Herman J. Mankiewicz's best works, albeit Mankiewicz was a superb screenwriter. (Dinner at Eight, Wizard of Oz, Pride of the Yankees, etc)The 'groundbreaking' camera angles, for example, that are credited to Orson Welles (who was only 25 when he produce-directed it) should really be credited to Gregg Toland the DP on the film. However, Toland, it should be noted, was a student of the early German silent screen where many of the 'groundbreaking' camera angles could be seen two decades before Citizen Kane. In fact, before Toland invited Welles over to his home to teach him the camera and how it's used (days before primary shooting) Welles scarcely knew which end of the camera took light.",5,4,7,23 June 2007
Monster," A superb film.
","Italo Calvino's 1972 masterpiece, Invisible Cities, beautifully delineates realms of mind: some that counterpoint each other while others falling within the harmonic progressions of existence.  The complexity of being is rarely depicted as successfully as in the film Monster.  The story is not new nor is it fiction: The violation of a young girl essentially ends any chance of her living a normal life and she is thus thrown into a timeless path of degradation and progressive declination.  What is new here is the power in the volume of truth brought to this production by its creators.  
The well-crafted script enters into levels of truth rarely encountered in the American cinema, especially in today's industry.   Its subtlety is intertwined with ironies and its brutality plays out in both concord and chaos to her final destruction by the blind justice of today's American, Hammurabian society.   What is also genuinely new here is the astonishing performance of Charlize Theron, an actor originally from South Africa whose past work includes modeling and playing quiet beauties.  Here we are treated to a mounting level of skills in the past secluded by the press of her beauty.   The greatest surprise is that she was able to make the quantum leap from her past profile into the central arena of screen actors with levels of power not seen for decades.   She plays the 1980's female serial killer, Aileen Carol Wuornos, with deftness, fervor and nuance that is agonizing and at the same time wondrous to behold.  She looks, acts and smells like gutter trash. We feel her painful hunger for human contact at the same time the desperate loathing that she has for her victimizers.  In a final, perhaps planned irony, her final victim, perhaps the only innocent one, is played with great pathos by the extraordinary character actor Scott Wilson who long ago mesmerized us as one of the killers in Truman Capote's In Cold Blood. 
It is also important here to bow to the recent newcomer writer-director Patty Jenkins who with this work has also grabbed off the gold ring.  Italo Calvino would smile at this extraordinary, robust and unforgettable film.",10,0,0,26 January 2004
Elizabeth," Elizabeth: The Flawed Virgin Queen
","This biopic on Elizabeth of Tudor daughter of Henry VIII has the visual elegance of a fine film.  However, it is flawed with (at least the Home Video cut I saw) badly identified continuity sequences and characters in the earliest sections of the film.  Thus, the narrative, the telling of the story, may leave some viewers a bit discontented. The narrative takes us from the pre-recognition and coronation of Elizabeth, who does not know whether she is going to be put to death or made Queen, to the consolidation of her power through the assassination of her enemies.  At this writing, I have not checked the historical validity of the story (in particular since this is a freebie review written just to share my reaction on this Godsend Website).  The narrative screams for the handling of a more suitable filmmaker with far better grasp of story telling and cinematic reveal.  However, there are gifts a-plenty.  What the film offers is what appears to be authentic restoration pageantry, which is superb. Along with that is exceptional camera followed by fine editing.The music score is beguiling and beautiful. The purist would have loved to hear authentic period music where I recognized segments of Mozart's Requiem written some two centuries after the Elizabethan period.  In summary, the film is somewhat flawed, especially in its entry scenes, but certainly worth seeing.",Null,0,0,8 May 1999
Finding Nemo," Albert Brooks in clownfish clothing.
","FINDING NEMO is a typical Pixar product: A stunning visual enterprise.  Its avant-garde computer imaging technology wiped out the century old, cel animation process.  It's done, curiously enough, by a studio headed by former Walt Disney people who for some reason bolted Disney to form their own shop.  One can only guess why.  Of course, Disney will distribute. After all it's not only entertaining product but fulfills the single ultimatum of Hollywood: Make Money.  Forget Shakespeare's injunction: to celebrate life.Thus, we find ourselves with an engaging story about a father fish in search of his missing, remaining son after a mean barracuda has gobbled up his spouse and other offspring.  Alas, a skin-diving Australian dentist has lifted the son for the tank in his office, to be held there for Darla, his ever-so-frightening, brainless, little daughter.   Finding Nemo is always interesting to watch.  It's a, very clever, sometimes hilarious, six-minute, shtick-filled cartoon stretched into 100 minutes. One can forgive its story flaws in all the fun.  However, the use of a talented, well-known actor like Albert Brooks in the lead role is puzzling. Disney himself avoided the use of major names in order to evade the audience confusion of hearing an easily imaged voice coming out of a drawn character. The most distinct instance of this is in SNOW WHITE where he chose the completely unknown voice of Adriana Caselotti over the reigning voice of the day, Deanna Durbin.  Shamus Culhane, for whose biography I helped him find a publisher and who worked on that classic film, assured me that the decision to use Caselotti (who passed at 80 in 1997) was intentional and not forced by the then prevailing funding shortage.  This was Disney's first feature length cartoon and he wanted the best for it.  Indeed, it lives today, still, over half a century later, as meaningful as the day it was released.
Finally, the most unfortunate aspect of NEMO, an otherwise fine product, is its lack of meaning.  It lacks my hallmark for greatness, a soul at its center.  As such, NEMO, like all of the other Pixar products thus far, will be long forgotten when films like SNOW WHITE and PINOCCHIO are still being heralded as classics.  Why Pixar does this when it has a $94 million budget to lavish on a product begs the question: A shallow fish story in deep water.",5,3,6,16 December 2003
Silent Hill," Toxic Trash
","This mean-spirited, incoherent film is graphically and literately an abomination. The flawed, Swiss-cheese-like plot requests of the viewers to place their tongue deeply into their cheeks and come up with the sources of extreme malevolence, character motivation, plot points, continuity and structure in general.It's not surprising that not a single important critic has approved of this product. What is surprising is that some $50,000,000 was spent on its construction.We can imagine using that amount to bring to the screen at least ten or more actual stories that inspire and uplift the human spirit and celebrate life, not injure psychologically the many innocent young children who will unfortunately get to see this ugly, metaphysically unsound junk. This is yet another irresponsible Hollywood product that can do nothing more than go on to vandalize our civility at a time when we least need it.",1,2,8,26 April 2006
Capote," A triumph of the screen craft.
","In the natural world there is the Pacific Salmon that swims back from the sea for miles up rivers and streams, often jumping waterfalls in order to reproduce. We've all seen depictions of this phenomenon on film and just this past summer were awed by MARCH OF THE PENGUINS, essentially the same theme; the death of a flower as it yields its seeds.In this quietly powerful film we see exactly the same story but on a human scale. Coming of age one of the most talked about writers of the late 1950s was Truman Capote. He was then celebrated as a NEW YORKER short story writer. He became very famous through television appearances but you are likely to remember Blake Edwards' film based on his story, BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S. The Edwards film was good but not really Truman Capote.CAPOTE the movie is based on a 1988 biography by Gerald Clark. It's a superbly written screenplay in which Capote's character is fleshed out with great nuance and detail as he researches and writes his most famous work, a commanding, seminal 'nonfiction novel' that influenced novelists thereafter, IN COLD BLOOD. If we are to believe this filmic presentation then Truman Capote's six year dedication to the research and writing of this book, his emotional involvement with the killers, who were human after all, especially one, a part American Indian who had brains and whose childhood story paralleled Capote's then the production of this book killed Capote in the long term. He died in 1984 mostly due to liver damage caused by drinking. Although he wrote some 20 additional works after that, none were novels nor attained as much fame as the book.The film CAPOTE is a triumph of the screen craft. Its subtle intelligence and powerful human emotion is rare in films. Highly recommended, it is not without some violence since it depicts to some extent the killings in Kansas. However if you are a fan of great American films, this one is not to be missed.",10,0,0,4 February 2006
Interstellar," Sorry but I march to a different drum.
","It is not just the impossible science in the script, for example; the fact that a gravity sufficient to slow down time by a factor of 60,000 (one hour equals seven years) would make it impossible to land a ship using our known technology. It would instantly crush the vehicle along with its crew. Not major but contributory, the title itself, 'Interstellar' is a misnomer since the lead character travels beyond dimensions, not just between stars.The script begins to fall apart when it is actually less than half way through. By the end, it is out of control and wildly bizarre. The intelligence alluded to as 'they' is far too nebulous and ranges into incoherence. A murky plot and the use of often-mumbled tech-babble move it all to the realm of the juvenile scenario. As a literary device, the use of babble instead of coherent language is as silly as Bugs Bunny pulling a large hammer from behind his back, out of nowhere.The scene where Coop finally meets his daughter, Murph, as an old woman was touching, but the casting of the highly recognizable Ellen Burstyn, albeit, a wonderful actor was, however, inappropriate since it tends to destroy suspension of disbelief.Those critics that do not wish it revealed that they do not understand it will give it rave reviews in order to convince others that they do understand it. Some of the audience will go the same way. Such is our contemporary Hollywood scenario.",5,7,12,12 November 2014
Predator," Great film, if a bit flawed:
","This original Predator # one is extraordinary, even in repeat viewing, for Arnold fans. Its sequels are OK, especially number two with Danny Glover but this one is the best. For first viewers it has a great, slow reveal to terror. Two future state governors worked on this one and both are interesting to watch, both former athletes with large bodies. The only two issue I had with this one is – A) In one scene it shows Arnold going for his knife only to discover it has fallen out of his sheath somewhere, back perhaps during his two long falls into water. Later, we see that he has magically found it, somehow. B) In the final scene, he has escaped the predator. The predator has set up what appears to be a nuclear explosion in attempt to destroy his adversary, who has dealt him a lethal dose of heavy timber. A helicopter shows up on the scene. Inn the middle of the jungle and after the explosion, the helicopter magically locates Arnold. Giant gaps like this work against my suspension of disbelief. What also works against the grain is that something like that gruesome monster, a brutal hunter, has managed to create the technology for interstellar travel. It's akin to believing that a wild boar has accomplished rocket science and all of its ramifications.",8,0,0,4 November 2010
The Aviator," An unfortunate disappointment.
","There is several related but distinctive ways to present a life history. Here are just five of them:1. Fiction: As in Jack London's autobiographical, 'Martin Eden.' This calls for the engagement of story elements where a protagonist is introduced, conflict results from his or her personality and life choices and the conflict is resolved with the effect of having the character changed. 2. Panorama: As in David Lean's unforgettable 'Lawrence of Arabia' where the subject becomes the pivotal instrument of a historical event and epic magnitude is attained. 3. Pageant: As in Richard Attenborough's memorable Gandhi where the subject actually creates history within the presentation of a story and that story once again reaches epic importance. 4. Chronicle: As in Sunrise at Campobello, the story Franklin Delano Roosevelt, or The Spirit of St. Louis, on the Charles Lindbergh flight. 5. Tabloid: Where a laundry list of yellow press reportage is woven into continuity. Aviator is the last of these. Here is a by-the-numbers presentation of tabloid headline stories fleshed into sometimes interesting dialogue but never revealing the depths of the man except for one odd, unexplored scene from his childhood with his mother. Nor does the film adequately present Hughes' remarkable influence on the history of aviation. Instead it's tossed off in a casual style except for the depiction of some of his dramatic adventures in aviation while his early career in Hollywood is presented as an exaggerated, frenzied comic strip. Another curiosity, not a single one of the selected actors in the film bears the slightest resemblance to the celebrity being played. For example, Jean Harlow is played by an ethnic, Mediterranean type of woman in what looks like a tight, cheap blonde wig instead of the airy, blousy colorless hair which was Lombard's trademark. Cate Blanchett does a fine job at emulating the Kate Hepburn voice but has none of her fine, angular facial features. The worst choice was Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner, nowhere close. The physical miscastings are topped by Leonardo DiCaprio who, God bless him, works his little heart out playing Hughes but selling us his Oogie Pringle, Walter Denton teen, nasal soprano voice for Hughes' baritone is challenging. This mismatch is compounded especially for those of us who can still recall the mature, handsome face of Howard Hughes and can contrast it with DiCaprio's still unlined Kewpie appearance. Perhaps the most irritating part of this picture is in its distortion of Howard Hughes' years where we see, for example, his extreme and radical mental deterioration begin before his famous senate hearings of 1947 which was not the case. My own original and primary research with a long time friend who lived in Vegas and knew Hughes in his final years said to me emphatically that he was not the bizarre psycho with long fingernails and matted hair described in the media back then.In summary, the film is devoid of meaning and strangely hollow. It is conversely not without some entertainment value. It has some marvelous performances in it, especially that of Alan Alda as Senator Ralph Owen Brewster. However, as a biopic of Howard Hughes I can't recommend it",3,62,122,3 January 2005
Man of Steel," Unfortunately, greatly disappointing
","For me, this new Superman epic, Man of Steel, where the name Superman seems to be verboten, was greatly disappointing. The trailers, at least the early ones were filled with promise and hinted at intelligence, substance and story instead of yet another gross-out treatment of today's over the top violence that has begun to show up in blockbusters.What story there is, was swamped and drowned out with the excessively loud noise of a sound track that has not been equalized and drifts from normal to painfully loud, all to keynote meaningless, superfluous and excessive violence. Here, the villain, Zod, is a cardboard, two dimensional character without enough subtext for audiences to be able to identify with him beyond anything but a machine that has broken down. Curiously, there was also no stimulating or illuminating musical score to unify and bring inspiration to the entire procedure. This was not a well made film. I am reminded of the awful corporate blunder, in 1985, by the Coca Cola Company when they replaced a drink that had become an American tradition given impetus by WWII, with carbonated pancake syrup. In my view, the expenditure of more than $200 million on a production carries social implications and at least the responsibility of the social impact. Beyond that, an opportunity to bring a bit of literacy and decency to the millions who will see the movie. This was not to be in this outing.If the rumor mills are correct they are doing a sequel. Well, perhaps they should start by trying to find where Kal El's red shorts disappeared and then hire a professional screenwriter and director with at least some semblance of consciousness.//RaÃºl",6,2,6,17 June 2013
Cast Away," A resplendent spiritual journey.
","Even slight flaws appear to loom larger when embodied in a near perfection. The few defects, however, do not mar the overall excellence of this fine production. 	Here, we learn once more that our journey through life might not be what we expected and that it might hold challenges that will in the end make us stronger.   The spiritual depth of this film is profound.  At a more superficial level, it is an engrossing adventure, a story not just about love but how badly we humans need each other for our happiness. Robert Zemeckis, by this creation, seems to have blossomed from an imaginative filmmaker to one of penetrating depth.  Like Frank Capra before him, Zemeckis draws upon the subtle whispers of the spiritual realm beyond and in so doing, has delivered to us a timeless movie.",9,0,0,13 June 2001
American Beauty," A HOLLYWOOD PUZZLE
","AMERICAN BEAUTY is a shot-list of anecdotes about self-centered people who oftentimes speak in surreal dialog.  This pretentious, poorly structured feature that swept the 2000 Oscars is one of Hollywood's enduring puzzles. How a boring film that has nothing to offer but pretense makes it this far is a complete mystery to me. Its industry popularity and critical acclaim is utterly astounding to me.          No doubt Kevin Spacey is a fine actor, but the 2000 best actor Oscar if there really is one, clearly belonged to Denzel Washington for HURRICANE.		Here, we see visuals that have no real meaning but are conjured for effect that simply deepens the meandering. We hear meaningless dialog that is nothing more than teenage angst.         This hodgepodge is nothing but a mishmash of oddball, misfiring scenes altogether not making a half-baked B-film scenario.  But hey, it takes all kinds of ballplayers to make up a ball game.  Those who enjoy quickly forgotten tongue in cheek films this might be for you.",3,1,1,31 March 2000
Gone with the Wind," A triumph!
","It took many years, six, I believe, for Margaret Mitchell to complete the writing of her Pulitzer Prize winning book on which the feature film is based.  The novel shows it and it was still being written with major changes, for example, in its title and the name of its  protagonist from Pansy to Scarlett even while its publisher, Macmillan, was preparing it for print.  The film also took years in development, including the great struggle to locate exacting matches for its characters and then the application of some of the finest crafts men and women in what might have been the peak year of Hollywood's Golden Age.  The film shows that as well.  It should be included in all curricula on filmmaking and in long form writing.  It is a finely etched, beautifully considered character study.  As such it is a triumph in American literature in both novel and film forms.  Like all finely accomplished works of the human heart it has become timeless.Beyond all of that we are left with a depiction of artistry in both literature and movie making when as in other forms, such as architecture, love was part if the gestalt of creation and profit at bottom line accounting and the marketplace were not the major compelling issues.  Here, we have an example of serendipity and timing of arts at a moment in our history when it was possible to create the enduring classic that this is. 'Gone with the Wind' might also describe the possibility of such a moment.",10,0,0,23 May 2003
No Country for Old Men," Olympic Grade Snooker Team (warning - spoilers)
","The Coen Bros. are laughing all the way to the bank. Many critics often rave about products that are incoherent but somehow have the appearance of lucidity. These critics certainly do not want anyone to know they have been snookered. No Country for Old Men is perhaps the crowning achievement for this 'tongue-in-cheek' crowd.Here we have a film that builds up to great expectation with meticulously crafted tension and extraordinary production values, casting and performances but in the first part of the third act simply stops. Strong characters rendered by actors in good performances are either killed or hinted at being killed with no scenaric detail. The killer whose enigmatic character has become magnetic simply drives off into the horizon suffering only a broken arm in a mindless car accident. Cosmic intervention or comic relief? The overall feeling is that the Coens ran out of budget but one can also strongly suspect that it might be that they decided to simply screw the audience and see if they could get away with it in a bizarre and sinister mind-set perhaps borne of some kind of chemical or psychological overdose. In any event at this writing it appears that they have, especially with eight Oscar nominations, at least for a great number of fans and critics not yet sure of themselves.The movie is about as fulfilling and satisfying as being stood-up by an important romantic date for which one has spent half a day preparing. The level of impact and effect then depends upon one's level of masochistic personality, sense of self or overall intelligence.",4,3,5,27 January 2008
The Incredibles," Terrific popcorn muncher
","As intellectually sweeping and philosophically cavernous as a tin thimble, THE INCREDIBLES remains the best film thus far (the latest in an astonishing series of continuous hits) to issue from the Pixar group (Disney distributed). This studio's founders are former Disney people. Whatever, they really know how to win and win again, something that Disney itself has forgotten how to do. The 3-D, CGI animated film is a fast moving trans-genre (action-adventure, comedy/parody) picture that all can enjoy at the visceral level. If fun is your thing this one is for you. It's clever, witty, brightly written and directed by Brad Bird whose credentials include The Iron Giant (1999).The only downside for me was the use of very well known live-action voices for the leads, whose real life images kept intruding and competing with the graphically rendered characters. As I said in previous comments on animated films, this is a personal irritant. For some it might not even be an issue.However, I fail to understand the need for 'known' voices. Not in the farthest reaches of my imagination would I suspect that Holly Hunter's voice, for example; though stylized, very rich and easy to discern, was a box office draw for this product. When looking at the rendered character I kept wanting to see Holly Hunter. This is as disturbing as watching a badly lip-synced foreign film. Again, it's the reason that Walt Disney chose the unknown Adriana Caselotti for the voice of Snow White (1937) as opposed to some giant box office voice of the period. It might be noted here that Disney's early films all had intellectual levels of meaning as well as the entertainment values. Both today's Disney and Pixar seem not to care about this. Yet, depth is what gives a film legs and renders it a true classic. At the bottom line, nevertheless: The Incredibles is highly recommended for the sheer, if easily forgettable, fun of it.",8,0,1,12 November 2004
The Man Who Would Be King," Conceivably, John Huston at his very best.
","The Man Who Would be King, which came together with an ideal cast and script based on a Rudyard Kipling story is perhaps John Huston's best film.  Some would argue in defense of African Queen, or the visually eloquent Moulin Rouge, which is my second favorite Huston product, but give me a rousing, escapist tale, well conceived, written and produced with a shining cast, and I am there.Huston was not a William Wyler, nor a Billy Wilder or Frank Capra, whose films soar, but here, with the conjunction of Kipling, Michael Caine and Sean Connery as two British sergeants in the Victorian days of old India and British empire he fired off a keeper.  Of course, this is a man's film but for men, if any movie was meant for video, DVD and repeated enjoyment it is this one.",10,4,6,26 February 1999
Ex Machina," Superb movie-making
","As a writer and visual concept artist, I was designing a new book cover for an author friend of mine, so in the process I recommended the movie, Ex Machina, to her. She said she was not going to bother with it --- and I found out why, the trailers caused her to believe it was about humans having sex with robots.I told her, 'not even close' and that if you blink, you might miss even the mention of sex in the picture.Once again, the pinheads in advertising thinking they know how to sell a movie but in fact, destroying its release in the process. In fact, the film has one of the few multi-level-of-meaning, brilliant scripts I have seen in many years and everything else that follows, casting, production values, all superb. It would be a shame to see this one not make back its investment. Ex Machina is one of the best films I have seen in years. It is a study of human consciousness and the possibility of consciousness without conscience. For me, that is brilliant time and money spent on a movie.",9,15,29,9 May 2015
The Illusionist," Hollywood at its best.
","The list of good things to come from the communist period of Russia and East Europe is quite short. At the top of the tiny list is the untouched great parts of cities that are still in a high state of 19th Century preservation. This great sanctuary makes a wonderful set for this superb film.Here, we're immersed in the graceful era of cobblestones, gaslight and an equestrian society of high dress code, the great unwashed obviously so. Add to that a marvelously written script filled with the enchantment of surprise; all told, a delightful, artistic set of Chinese Boxes with a pearl at the center, a genuinely powerful yet socially impossible love. The surrounding outer boxes are the deeply etched characters of the story, the extraordinary photographic treatment and above all, the metaphysical music score of Philip Glass, a composer that has fascinated me from the earliest years of my adult life.This production engages at all levels of appreciation. The outer box is the performances of the two central leads, critically acclaimed actors Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti who beguile us with a masterful balance of nuance and verve. The last ten minutes of the film are entrancing if not altogether unpredictable. This is one of those rare films that leaves me envious because I had nothing to do with its creation; very highly recommended",10,2,3,7 September 2006
Million Dollar Baby," Eastwood's best entry to date (2004)
","Eastwood says 'it is not a fight picture' but if this is not a fight picture then what is it? He calls it a 'love story.' What it really is, in pure essence, is a story of the triumph of the human spirit. Boxing, however, in particular a form even more odious to me than male boxing, if that is possible, is the thematic vehicle.The only major weakness of the film lies in its 'lines of broadcast' what we called a story riddled with predictability in the old Paramount creative lab where I was fortunate enough to be tortured and harassed by several old pros for some time; writers and masters, they were. The predictability rises to the level of contrivance. That said, though it's also generally a familiar tale it stands as Clint Eastwood's career best picture to 2004 and also his best performance to date. In the subtext of the Eastwood character's mysterious negative relationship with his own daughter (whom we never meet nor understand) as he trains a young woman boxer there lays a profound irony which takes the story into the realm of the classics.The picture is a hard-sell pitch FOR euthanasia, in which I believe and something that thus far only the more intelligently governed nations can grasp (e.g. The Netherlands). It's also a real put-down on the entire fight game on several levels; the most salient is the retarded character, with the obvious name: Danger Barch. His entire presence and subtext scenario is not accidental.Not a major aspect but although predictable the script carries very good dialog.The heartfelt gift of this film, however is a return to the fabulous rolling narrative performed by Morgan Freeman in Shawshank Redemption. Here, he once again asks us to sit quietly with him as he tells his bittersweet human tale.The feature has from me a qualified recommendation (if you can tolerate depicted boxing violence in the extreme).",9,1,5,10 February 2005
Brave," The good and the not so good of Brave.
","Without one iota of exaggeration, this new Pixar production, Disney release, is visually stunning. It has artful, clearly defined characters that loom off the screen, literally and especially so, in 3D. Some of the scenic movement is reminiscent of the great Ratatouille of a few years ago. That is saying a lot.To its credit, Brave depicts a young woman who fights for the right to live out her own life. However, that did not quite snatch the gold ring for me. It was just not enough substance. The production budget on this animated film was $185 million. In decades past, the shallow, somewhat sluggish script, seen here, would never have obtained a green light. It was difficult to watch all of the superb, brilliant artistry (actor voices included) and production values, design elements, wasted on that flat, empty script.Real literature, with its varied levels of meaning, and the old, sage, scenarist's secret, best embodied by the works of Frank Capra, Gene Roddenberry and Rod Serling, the 'Spiritual Payoff' is now absent from the big screen. Take note how their works have survived through the decades.Most of today's studio suits do not appear to be aware that films structured at that level have the best word of mouth and the best legs. Today, they aim only at the child mentality where Walt Disney aimed at the widest audiences. His Pinocchio, for example, is still vital today. Indeed, some of its music has become the signature Walt Disney logo theme. That said, one blessing in current animated feature films, they no longer break continuity for Broadway type song and dance numbers, tedious nonsense that clung on to animated features like a giant fungus, for decades.Is it very difficult to come up with a soul for these scripts? I think not. In Pinocchio, for example, the log line is simple: A wooden puppet earns the right to his most ardent wish, to become a real boy.",8,3,5,28 June 2012
Clash of the Titans," The Kraken is released (again).
","Perhaps the worst thing any of us movie lovers can surrender to is blind trust in film critics. I have always wondered from what dark tank in hell do these (mostly men, for some bizarre reason) so called critics emerge? Very few that I have read appear to have ever set foot on a set much less partaken of one shoot in the production process, for they often irresponsibly toss off extraordinary efforts and artistic triumphs with great expense in blood, sweat, tears and resources as one would pick out an overdone piece of popcorn and toss it.Thus, having read several critics on the new milling of Clash of the Titans and remembering quite well the awful Second Avenue-second hand budget of the 1981 rendition with its stop motion animated puppets, I dragged myself to the theaterwith it in mind that I would once again have to hear Liam Neeson shout, 'Release the Kraken,' after wincing from a dozen or so trailers that followed my favorite news programs on TV.What I experienced was stunning production values crowned by brilliant Homeric design and art work even to the minutest detail in both sets and costume. There was so much detail that even some of the men's hairstyles were impressive (Sam Worthington – Perseus' - 'do' notwithstanding). In this marvelous production was one instance where I expected nothing and got everything. The very fine cast is icing on the cake.As an old fan of Greek mythology I found myself highly rewarded. However, while the script simply nods at the original tales of Perseus and Andromeda there is so much good action here in a strong plot, and done so stylishly that one quickly leaves the original mythology in the vest pocket, perhaps where it really belongs.",9,9,17,6 April 2010
World Trade Center," The Power of the Human Spirit
","The lofty title of this film is somewhat erroneous because it is really the true story about two Port Authority cops trapped in the rubble of the collapsed WTC towers. It follows them from amidst their lower middle class families living in New York City boroughs from early morning of 9/11 and into the insane terror to come.This is probably the most well-balanced and objective film I have seen from Oliver Stone. It's thoroughly professional, well written and directed. The reconstruction of the atrocious terror and its severe impact is meticulous. Emotionally moving, it's flawed perhaps only by the excessive, anguished histrionics of the two officers' families which while easily understood does not play well in dramatic presentation. There is an old axiom, here: 'If the character cries the audience does not.' However, as a vehicle for the power of the human spirit the film is otherwise worthy and competent. The real story here and the most heartfelt is that of the former real life ex-marine, Dave Barnes who while not even from New York City leaves his work and his home town, puts on his old uniform, wheedles his way into the mountain of violent WTC aftermath and eventually locates the two cops buried deeply in the mounds of twisted steel and concrete. His single-minded act of extraordinary courage and commitment to his country and fellow man is all too rare today in this holistic idea of a nation that gives so much to its citizens many of whom take it all for granted. The film is highly recommended.",9,2,6,17 August 2006
A Bug's Life," Graphic excellence mounted on wafer thin plot.
","The best children's stories in the literature have souls.  By this, we mean they have significance and nourish the growing mind with inspiration, motivation, or teach something.  The stories need not be seminal but should at least bring some value to the reader or audience. This is the case, for example, in Pinocchio, where a puppet loved life so much it wanted to be a real boy and by its goodness became one. In A Bug's Life, we find nothing even approximating a meaningful story.  It is tragic because the producing studio, Pixar, has developed the finest graphic animation in the world today in character renderings.That the studio limits itself to children's audiences is their choice and certainly, although more limited than a crossover or a family market the child market still yields enough box office to keep the doors open. Why they have chosen to produce superficial stories, however, so flat and wafer thin they will not have legs for the future, is a mystery.We hope that at some point this remarkably talented group of animators will somehow mature into a shop with a strong story group that can manage to locate a good source of literature to mount with their beautiful artistry.  Indeed, no American animation producer has had strong story resources or even analytical recognition since the death of Walt Disney in 1966.",3,3,13,24 April 1999

It is a modern day 'Jack the Giant Killer' complete with subtext scenarios that are rare in today's Hollywood product.

The Dark Knight," The Grand Guignol of comic book films
","Amidst the clamor there might always be a dissenting voice with a different perspective and one who climbed up to the top of the high risers to view this production perhaps a few dozen yards above the gargoyle-like, statuesque Caped Crusader.Here, banter about the nature of a criminal mind and sweeping sky flights and explosions replace story values and depth. Continuity is sacrificed for action. An over the top performance wild enough to be suspected for dope fueling by a now beloved, dead actor keynotes the scenario and etches deep into the psyche deep enough to be indelible and appears to bring glory to what is really an overblown, contrived production.Extreme cruelty and sadistic enterprise replace plot and hammer away the chain of promises of the story. Where in Batman Begins we had a fascinating account and worthy characterizations we now have unsupported, unfounded surprises with gaps in character development. The personality dysfunction is so extreme as to press painfully against the science of psychology and the logic of common sense.What is it that drives the audiences and critics so wild about this production where the budget soared to almost $200 million? In the annals of film history we were uplifted by life affirming values, the motives of true heroes and were rewarded by story somehow easing a small aspect of our tedious, sometimes painful, boring lives. Instead we now are treated to the Circus Maximus, the Flavian Amphitheater, blood, gore, and easy, cheap death. The film theater critics rave and drool. Bob Kane simply turns, uncomfortably in his grave.",6,6,11,25 July 2008
Super 8," Disappointing
","When I saw the title, 'AMBLIN' with a bicycle silhouetted by the moon, as the film started, I said, 'Oh, oh.' I was right to be apprehensive. The film was filled with dumb, illogical plot devices, non-sequitur scenes, childish, hokey writing and the most absurd plot device I have ever seen in a movie. Get this:A high speed train being hauled by a diesel locomotive weighing in excess of 15,000 tons is caused to entirely crash, derail and have its cars spread out about half a mile by a small pick up truck. The crash continues for about ten minutes. Is that stupid enough? No. Guess what? The driver of the small pick up truck survives ... with some injuries. The driver is later murdered by the Air Force, giving no meaningful or logical explanation for the murder.It's Sci-Fi as seen from the eyes of early teenagers. The dumb things we saw in some of the Spielberg films from years ago, such as a boy hammering away at his breakfast dishes at his breakfast, with a large plastic bat, while his parents ignore him, all intact in this film. I cannot believe this is a JJ Abrams movie. The film was one 'HUH, WHAT?' moment after another. Going further would contain too many spoilers. If you can ignore all the dumb moments, you might enjoy it.",5,7,14,10 June 2011
The Last Samurai," A moving celebration of life.
","Overall The Last Samurai is a beautifully written document visualized by some of the top professionals of the film trade. It is a fiction; however, an overlay nesting over a historical period of transition in Japan as it begins to embrace the West after centuries of isolation.
All of the finest production values are in place. My most ardent complaint is the selection of Tom Cruise as the protagonist. At no point in the picture did I or could I forget that I was looking at Tom Cruise playing a part. This single quirk withheld the moviegoing experience from its promise of sufficiency for me.Still, I must recommend the film. It is powerfully moving and produced with the artistry that only the top professionals in the pixbiz can accomplish. More than likely we all know the film's Logline: A man who loses his soul on the killing fields of the late 19th Century Indian Wars of the American West finds it again in the far Eastern spiritual vortex of a Japan also in transition. The movie suggests that those who embraced Samurai and its Bushido Code were all noble, decent men, which is of course not true. Yet embedded within the concept of Samurai (which most us know means 'to serve') is the idea of honor. In this idea we see that there was never really a 'last Samurai' in Japan but that Samurai underwent spiritual transition to a work and production ethic. This ethic today leads the entire world in peerless industrial achievement and products that are generally unmatched in quality by any other nation.",8,1,2,17 December 2003
Up," Up gets my sky high rating
","The best cinematic thing the Walt Disney Company has done in the past half century is tie in with Pixar, a group of brilliant animation filmmakers founded by John Lasseter who left Disney for Lucasfilm in the early eighties and Ed Catmull who was made the head the new company's digital imaging at that time under new corporate head, Steve Jobs. We all know of their extraordinary success. The films appear to just get better as the years roll by and fine writers are located and brought aboard.UP is a quality peer of the best animated feature films ever made. However, somewhat unlike the first two Disney animated features, Snow White and Pinocchio. These two are as yet to be surpassed in enduring contentwhat the great director, Frank Capra, once told me, 'Something to put in their pocket and take home with them.' It's what I call spiritual content, that is, subtext that speaks to the soul.Thus, unlike the first two classics made under the auspices of Walt Disney himself, however, UP is a bit light in its spiritual core and heavier on action and storytwo good attributes of all Pixar features, and in this case with strong sentiment and heartwarming scenes. However, this lack in formula always shortens the legs of all features, live action included.Another fuzz-ball in the lens is the contemporary use of well known voices such as Ed Asner, who does a commendable job as the lead character in UP, Carl Fredricksen, but whose voice clearly kicks off real life images from the brain's memory bank which then conflict with the animated character's image on screen.In 1978 while researching my first place national book festival prizewinner, The World of Animation, at the Walt Disney Company in Burbank, I interviewed several people that had worked with Disney in the mid to late 1930s and was also associated for some years with Shamus Culhane who worked on both of the first two Disney animated features. As a brief sidebar, Jimmy (Shamus)Culhane's name was left out of the of Pinocchio credits because he quit Disney before that film was released in order to help (and in addition for an erroneous health assumption) the Fleischer brothers in Miami on their first two animated featurestwo films not so successful due to poor scripting but both features that had charm: Gulliver's Travels and Hoppity Goes to Town.As for Shamus, most of the scene where Pinocchio sets out to school with an apple for the teacher and meets the fox and cat was animated primarily by Shamus.Shamus and others who were there at the time of Snow White's production confirmed that the reason that Walt Disney used Adriana Casellotti's singing voice, totally unknown, instead of Deanna Durbin's or Judy Garland's in Snow White, for example, was primarily because of the image conflict that does occur with audiences when they hear a very well known voice speaking for an animated character with which we are trying to identify. Today nearly all (but not all) American animation studios use celebrity voices in contrast to the very early years. They also pay top dollar for these voices, a completely unnecessary budget expense.All that said, UP is a wonderful animated film and not just for children, another idea that Walt Disney had that has often been forgottenthat animation is not just for children. The feature animation from other nations bears this out.",9,1,1,3 June 2009
The Da Vinci Code," Spectacular film craft.
","This spectacular film might turn out to be Ron Howard's magnum opus. Certainly it's his best piece of work to date and stands head and shoulders over anything he has thus far done, a body of work that is by and large quite good.A mixed genre murder mystery, political intrigue thriller and drama woven into Catholic Church religionist mythography The daVinci Code is a physically beautiful film, graphically eye-popping with an excellent music score, superbly filmed throughout England, Scotland and Paris there's enough eye-filling scenery here to alone cover the price of the ticket. The nicely woven script engages from the very first scene and remains gripping to the stunning, final half hour reveals that are tiered like a wedding cake. There are, of course, some contrivances knit into the continuity but one can easily forget them and simply enjoy the film. Kudos for the entire cast, bad guys, good guys and pure nut-job guys all in all this great film receives my highest recommendation.Wonderful! Well done Opie!",10,4,8,22 May 2006
The Matrix Reloaded," Empty Calories; flying bodies & karate chop-tedium.
","In some instances of big budget films Screenwriting 101* appears have been orphaned in the Hollywood scene.  Characters are now simply foisted upon us sans introduction, for example, so we the audience does not identify with them.  Not identifying with them we therefore don't really care what happens to them.  Not caring for the characters we don't get terribly involved with the story (what little there is).  We are then left with a banal list of scenes where the current vogue (at this writing) of flying bodies clash in the air ad nauseam.  The bodies simply keep coming back for more, unhurt, apparently even after being tossed against brick walls that a crushed by the bodies.*Consider: The stepladder of antagonists, sometimes called the 'chain of promises' are what keep people turning a page or sitting at the edge of a theater seat.  The way it works best is that the protagonist does not solve the first problem until the second problem is already introduced.  Each problem represents a promise to the viewer that there will be suspense, excitement and adventure in solving the problems.  We raved about The Matrix when it was first released because it had so much visual and structural inventiveness.  Now, the Wachowski Bros. appear to be saying, 'So, you like the incessant karate-chops and flying bodies, here's much more.'  In Matrix II Big-load a giant serving of the flying bodies that is apparently just a half of the plate, we are left quite sated.  Do we care about Matrix Big-Load Part III to come next fall?  Please say it isn't so.",4,0,0,20 May 2003
A Beautiful Mind," A Celebration of Life
","Empiricists are prone to simply place a label on something that cannot be quantified or qualified by sense perception and then to construct a mythology around it. This is the case in the science of human behavior. Abnormal behavior that is not understood, such as schizophrenia is labeled and categorized per its attending syndrome. Its symtomology is then attacked by various therapeutic methods and chemical concoctions, some which are more harmful to the patient than the so-called illness itself.In this exquisite film the protagonist suffers from schizophrenia as diagnosed by a psychiatrist. Yet, the film is not about the illness as much as it is about an extraordinary man who is quite different from most of us, a man who has far greater use of his brain than perhaps 99.9% of the rest of us. It is about his triumph despite the 'malady'.However, this malady, as seen by some metaphysicians takes on a more interesting casting. After Albert Einstein the entire world we thought we knew came up for grabs. In this new arena where temporal reality is invalidated and matter revealed as pure energy, where time and space are inextricably bonded and labeled illusory the astute metaphysician has no alternative but to see some abnormal behaviors as perhaps something far more profound than a dysfunction of the brain.As seen here, in this very best work thus far of Ron Howard after a director's career of excellence we are given the latitude to question the nature of the 'illness' called schizophrenia. We are also shown interweaving realities as perceived by an extraordinary mind and what happens when that mind meets the rest of us.",10,0,2,28 March 2002
Despicable Me," The best animated feature thus far for 2010.
","DESPICABLE ME has toppled the two giants, Pixar and DreamWorks Animation in this animated feature that is far above this year's animated feature products as we enter the mid-summer releases. Those of us who are grown-ups can forgive the predictable story since we know that we are not the primary audience for this film. Animated features are still made for children although the art form itself has long hungered after adult fare. It is quite capable of being applied to adult stories although very few Hollywood suits have yet to grasp that concept. The one exception that quickly comes to mind was the Ralph Bakshi animated films. Unfortunately, his work was illiterate and vulgar.Designed beautifully and with whimsical cleverness the characters are matched by superior writing. Although the scenes borrow concept humor from the once great Warner Bros. animation teams, the best-known being 'Termite Terrace,' the presentation is continuously funny, whimsical and entertaining. Steve Carell does his usually fine comic dialog--- as Gru, the villain that we know we will grow to love. Fortunately, for those who are very familiar with this fine comic voice, he masks it with an odd European accent that sometimes sounds like Bela Lugosi on steroids.This brings to mind having to sit through three Toy Story movies (thus far) and having to fight the image of Tom Hanks every time the character, Woody, would speak. Walt Disney was, of course, correct when he cast Adriana Caselotti as Snow White instead of the 'A' listed movie singers of the time because he wanted his audience not to have to go through that painful exercise. No doubt, greedy agents have sold modern animation producers a bill of goods but the tots who go to see these films could not care less about the names behind the voices even if they knew who they were, which they do not. Known, 'A' list voices needlessly pump up budgets for these films.Above the entire picture is the most amazing fact that DESPICABLE ME comes to us from Universal Animation, which was originally cobbled together from the Sullivan-Bluth efforts and other entities less than ten years ago. Whatever happened to bring this formerly humdrum studio to life let us hope for morewe will certainly look for it.",10,6,12,16 July 2010
Ben-Hur," The Perfect Feature Film
","Watching the third cinematic rendering of Ben Hur today it is astonishing to realize this film was released in 1959, nearly half a century ago.  It exhibits all of the attributes that bring enduring legs to a film.  Motion picture technology was such, by mid-century, that a print struck today from the three black and white films of the Technicolor process of that time looks as good as anything produced today.  The main difference is the style of lighting where many of today's directors knock themselves out to copy each other and bring a 'realistic' look instead of designing creative and dramatic light.  They end up delivering a dark film that is quickly dated for its style.  This is not so for Ben Hur, a film that will continue to tower long after we are all gone.	Here is an exciting and moving epic script wrought from a masterful, 19th Century novel, sets that are meticulous in research, design and execution, the finest actors of the period, including a knock-out performance by England's Hugh Griffith and Charleton Heston during his peak.  They are all in superb costumes with extraordinary photography, editing and music scoring.  The film also features what must be the most startling cinematic sequence of all time in the panoramic chariot race between the protagonist and antagonist of the story.  For fans and film students alike, this is perhaps the finest example of American cinema art of the 20th Century, the very pinnacle and without a single computer-rendered frame in the long 212-minute length of the film.",10,1,3,19 December 2001
Signs," Signs of intellectual weakness.
","Researchers who have spent decades studying the worldwide, mysterious phenomena of crop circles and land glyphs that are sometimes larger than several football fields side by side and yet form in minutes have postulated that the event is also ancient.  Evidences of this global mystery are age old. 	The attempt in this film of Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan to suddenly tie the historic phenomena to a wafer-thin, comic book contrivance of hostile alien incursion certainly does not wash.  At the level of the story we find in its text constant broadcast media reports of the aliens with no absolutely detail on their method or behavior.  We see items such as the hero confronting an alien locked in a pantry, the alien apparently weak as a kitten then later escapes, again giving no detail as to his escape but then having gained supernatural power.  Our hero cuts off some of its fingers afterward not seeking help from the police, nor mentioning the traumatic confrontation to no one.  He just goes about expressing fright.  In the subtext we find the hero, a minister, giving up his life commitment to God and humanity, in childish fashion, somehow forgetting all of his theological studies and comprehension of the complex universal workings of a supreme intelligence after the untimely death of his wife.  Some minister.  The entire mishmash of a production is given a bit of value only by the extraordinary performance of Mel Gibson who must have suffered working with the terrible script.	If you want to see a truly scary, brilliantly written and produced film about some comic book extraterrestrial alien threat check out THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD, the Howard Hawks 1951 classic usually credited to Christian Nyby. Any number of extraterrestrial threat films of this genre with stories going back as far as a century ago with H. G. Wells' WAR OF THE WORLDS is superior. We expected much more from this writer director after his solid showing in THE SIXTH SENSE.",2,2,3,8 August 2002
The Sixth Sense," A rose growing out of the garbage heap.
","THE SIXTH SENSE is one of the few films to explore the true multidimensional nature of humanity in a bright, recondite way.  It does so thoughtfully and with intelligence at every level of the film craft.   Most choices are superb with the possible exception of lighting, perhaps one or two f-stops too far down, in scenes that even on the big screen are difficult to discern.  It is clear why this option was taken but my choice would have been for a subtler approach.  However, the story's theme is classic in that it shows the superior choice of love over fear in dealing with the unknown.
	That said, the critical factors here are all present: Excellent screenplay, direction and cast.  The denouement is stunning and pulls the entire realization together in a most satisfying and refreshing way.  Accolades for writer-director, M. Night Shyamalan, who in the tradition of some directors does a little cameo here.  His future in the industry now appears to be gold.  From my view, he's our latest, much needed, precious gift from India.",9,0,0,23 August 1999
The Matrix," Classic metaphysical allegory framed in modern dress
","Andy and Larry Wachowski, who wrote and directed this finely written, darkly rendered film, have access. They have access to superior intelligence, theirs, and surprisingly, to the Hollywood industry, which usually scorns anything approximating intelligent film making. That the plot takes its motive from a tried and true classic Science Fiction concept (a projection into future reality with attending amplification of a current fear) should certainly not be a factor in any critical analysis of this production. With THE MATRIX, the Wachowskis have delivered to us a superior multilevel cornucopia of brain food and enough audiovisual sensory power to satisfy a wide range of audience.The realization of the plot is fast moving and with engrossing detail.  The dialogue is straight, like the scenario, with sparse subtext and filled with thought provoking concepts that are liberally tossed out in rapid fire, almost too fast. The payoff, at least for some of us, of course, is the exercise in mental gymnastics and the interlaced dialogues of mankind's true meaning on Earth.   What is mankind but mind, and can we survive ourselves:?  A good old song worth singing once more, and with dazzling orchestration.The film ends with a positive turn but leaves the intelligent viewer with much to reflect upon.   This is not a bad thing, not bad at all.",10,1,2,6 April 1999
Tarzan," Tarzan: Trashed by Disney
","The origins of Tarzan stories parallels those of Charles Dickens' wonderful stories in that they first appeared in much awaited periodicals.   This accounts for the continuing suspense in the original stories of Tarzan. While Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote other stories of equal quality and significance the Tarzan tales that first appeared in print in 1912 remain the most popular.As for the 'Disney version', here is yet another example of fine design and animation married to a gaunt, incommensurate and ineffective, screenplay. This is the 39th churning of the famous Ape-Man on film since the first in1918.   In all that time, for those of you who have read the originals, you would see that none of the great number of films thus far has done justice to the original stories.In this Disney airing, the film and character design is superb, the best to come from Disney in decades, especially in the Tarzan character who looks ever so much like Jonathan LaPaglia, a new, great profile and star of TV Adventure science fiction show, SEVEN DAYS.   With some of the work done in Paris, it has a European look, which are usually more aesthetic and soothing than the recent Burbank efforts.The backgrounds, like the characters, show great artistry.  But it is like watching a $150,000 leather upholstered Daimler Saloon powered by a five horsepower lawn mower engine.  The screenplay is papering thin, a skeleton of the classic Edgar Rice Burroughs tales of Tarzan.  Instead of adventure, the audience is fed Shtick.  In this version, we are not even honored by the appearance of a single African native in the entire film.The Disney studio management, apparently not at all up to snuff on the philosophy of their founder, Walt Disney, keep creating films for children's markets where their founder, in fact, did not.  The current studio works unlike Walt Disney in other ways.  This seems a mystery since they owe it all to the founding creative director who understood so much about audiences (that, unlike what you will hear from marketers, does not change at all when it comes to the human story and its parameters). Walt Disney, for example, in casting Snow White, cleverly avoided two of the great singing stars of the era, Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin, the latter whose great voice actually kept an entire studio, Universal, from going belly up.  Walt Disney a true creative director, albeit a whip-driving one, instead cast the completely unknown Adriana Caselotti (who died just two years before this writing).Do you know, for example, who stars in THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT?  There are hundreds of successful films that in fact made the stars as opposed to the reverse.  Remember ROCKY?  AMERICAN GRAFFITTI?  STAR WARS?  ET THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL? etc., etc.  The film's the thing, the story and how it is mounted.  All you need beyond that is talent, not 'names.'The uninspired, current Disney tycoons, apparently chain locked into their misperception of market demands, insist on casting very well known voices whose life images do battle with the animated character each time a line pours out of the speakers.  One keeps hearing daytime TV talk show host, Rosie O'Donnell, for example, and sees a cartoon ape mouthing the 'in your face', loudmouth Rosie.  It eats right into the heart of the story mood and thrust.  Thankfully, we are spared the usual mood shattering, time eating Broadway-styled musical numbers with just one small bit of helplessness in this film.While the writing offers some fair lines, albeit 1990s idiomatic language in the Victorian era, it lacks the kind of soul, the depth and legs that can take an animated film into the ages.  Phil Collins' contemporary pop songs further destroy the legs of the film.  These are, again, mixed with the Victorian era characters and story, instead of an original, inspiring musical score reminiscent of the period, yielding more mood conflict.The central interest here, it appears, in creating this particular Tarzan, was to put together an ephemeral product and associated commercial tie-ins that can look good in the year end annual report.  The days of creating enduring art at Disney although that art would secure continuous future income, now seems to be lost to the once creatively successful studio.Those who desire the original adventures of this timeless hero and wish to travel to far away places, perhaps the Dark Continent, and visit the vast imagination of Edgar Rice Burroughs, are urged to read the original tales.Raul daSilva Author: THE WORLD OF ANIMATION, Eastman Kodak, 1979.

These are, again, mixed with the Victorian era characters and story, instead of an original, inspiring musical score reminiscent of the period, yielding more mood conflict.The central interest here, it appears, in creating this particular Tarzan, was to put together an ephemeral product and associated commercial tie-ins that can look good in the year end annual report.  The days of creating enduring art at Disney although that art would secure continuous future income, now seems to be lost to the once creatively successful studio.Those who desire the original adventures of this timeless hero and wish to travel to far away places, perhaps the Dark Continent, and visit the vast imagination of Edgar Rice Burroughs, are urged to read the original tales.Raul daSilva Author: THE WORLD OF ANIMATION, Eastman Kodak, 1979.

Gangs of New York," Frankengangs!
","No argument! Martin Scorsese is a wonderful filmmaker, film historian, and a most likable fellow. I like him. I can't help it. Yet, I do not like most of his films. This one is debatably an exception, perhaps saved by inch-fractions primarily by the spellbinding, remorselessly superb acting chops of Daniel Day-Lewis. Curiously he is an Irish actor from Ireland playing an Irish immigrant-hating American of English ancestry, William Cutting, who in real life was no longer living during the final climactic scenes of this film. The shrugs do not end there. Leonardo DiCaprio (now, thankfully, finally, a grown man playing one) plays an Irish American (who struggles with his Irish accent throughout the film).The film ends with the NYC Draft Riots of 1863. Without drawing up a long list of historical inconsistencies and equivocations, as one example, famed Tribune Editor, Horace Greeley, who was only 52 at the time of these riots, is depicted as a wizened, old man in a long, white beard. In fact, he was only 61 when he died nine years later. Although the chances are that Greeley was brought into the story for his abolitionist views this remains unclear in this release cut of the film. Generally, this story of the search for vengeance by a boy who sees his father killed during a gang riot never weaves into a full, coherent scenario. The climactic backdrop of the New York City draft riots, in truth were fomented primarily by outraged laborers of mixed nationalities, e.g. of both Irish and German descent, against the importation of poorly paid blacks. These riots that were also given support by the Lincoln hating Tammany Hall-corrupt Democratic Party of the city of that time are not accurately presented here nor clearly melded into the story despite the fast intercuts of flyers and posters of the period. The films' depictions of US Navy Frigates (perhaps on the East River?) firing cannons into Manhattan is news to me, a born New Yorker who has lifelong followed New York history. Toward the end GANGS feels just like what it is a contrivance that upon departing leaves in its wake an empty feeling. The production values, design, ambiance and atmosphere are handsome. However this film, claimed by some overwrought hype writers, as the 'Birth of New York' is better described as myopic mayhem. If relentless brutality is your cup of tea, try it. Who knows?

Gladiator," A Beautifully Realized Film
","We had grown used to Ridley Scott missing in action when it came to story concept, plotline and story elements.  He seems to have gotten away with these shortcomings because his taste for visual aesthetics is peerless.  He is one of the few working directors whose grasp of visual beauty is constant and always gratifying.	In Gladiator, we are once again surprised because the grapevine said that the script was not really finished at the start and it kept changing with more than one writer in the pot mix.  Indeed, the Gladiator story is superficial and the concept as old as the hills of Rome, but one can delight in the hearing of an old song once more, finely rendered.          Unquestionably, this is a beautifully realized film.  It has all the elements, atmospheric musical score and a fine lead player with a solid supporting cast.  It did not get an overall excelent vote from me due to the current in-style dark lensing and film processing, apparently to look realistic or just to copy an awful dark style we first noticed on television, copied now by nearly everyone and as such will immediately lock the film into a quickly dated style as in the overuse of zoom lenses in the early 70s and similarly, with the Steadicam a few years later.  Heavy style like this serves only to date a film and cut its legs. This brooding, dark style would have worked fine in the north country scenes, the Germanium campaign, but when it continues into sunny Rome and then, worst of all, becomes even darker in the depiction of the Astral Plane in the final scenes, we had to wince.  The Astral Plane, for those who have been fotunate enough to visit it during meditation, if anything, is gloriously luminescent.       Here, we also bid good-bye to Oliver Reed, who died with three his scenes left undone.   The scenes are not missed, but some of us will miss Reed.	This is one I will be purchasing in wide screen DVD when it comes out. Thanks to an extraordinary filmmaker and company, it is a keeper.",9,0,0,12 May 2000
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Now you're cookin' with gas!
","This was a term for a hit, or success after a period of spotty effort from the period setting of this unique, ecstatic satire of the American South of the early 20th Century. 	Ethan and Joel Coen, brothers born in Minnesota and film educated at NYU is arguably the most original filmmaking team in US film history to date. Known best for FARGO fame, they first cracked Hollywood with BLOOD SIMPLE and except for FARGO, almost faded away with sputtering levels of fruition after their first outing. In this film, a borderline musical about three escaped chain-gang convicts, they come back with a vengeance. 	The cast, headed by a surprisingly new character rendering by George Clooney, story and direction, editing and production values are totally engaged here.  This is worth a rental for almost anyone who has a sense of humor and most decidedly a value if only for the hysterically bizarre Ku Klux Klan sequences.  Rent it and you might very well want to buy it after you see it.  It is certainly worth revisiting.",9,0,0,1 July 2001
