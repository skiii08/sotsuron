Scarface," The rise and rise and crash of Tony Montana
","This movie falls with considerable ease into the category of being one of the top movies of the Eighties. All facets of the movie were extremely strong. The direction was fantastic, but for me it was the acting of Al Pacino and the script of Oliver Stone that were the attributes of its success. These are the elements without which the allure would have been adversely affected. Given the commendable contribution of the rest, this serves as an indication of the enormous talent of these two.Scarface' is the name of the movie, and therefore its core focus. Tony Montana is Scarface and the central character in a frontline Hollywood movie always requires a powerful leading man exhibiting charismatic appeal, acting ability or both. Al Pacino is a popular actor whose acting ability graces the big screen. The role of Tony Montana could have been hammed up and appeared contrived, but neither is evident here. Instead we have an authentic portrayal of a Cuban exile that comes from a hard background and finally wants to prove his worth in the free country, America.Pacino manages to show the unschooled background of Montana without overacting. It was not the result of the Cuban accent he used which limited his grasp of the English language. It was more through his mannerisms. The emotive outbursts are clearly part of the character makeup and show his determination to make the world his own. Although he may be unschooled, he has the street savvy through which the confidence oozes in confrontational situations. Pacino is probably the best at playing the tragic hero. These are usually complex characters that the audience has to support no matter how depraved they are. Montana is a tragic hero because he is doomed from the start. Frank tells him that those who want it all never last was a message that was never heeded. He is also told to never get high on his own supply. These two unheeded messages are the mechanism of his downfall. Montana begins his slide from grace when the bank dealer raises the rates on him. It is from this point on that Pacino shows us how Montana starts to feel like a failure. He begins to want full credit for his success and starts to distance himself from those closest to him. Everybody else becomes a target for blame as Montana fails to take account for the realities of the world and his own failings.Of significance is that he fells that he cannot escape his depraved nature. The only redeeming factor that he has is a burden because he is all consumed by power. Tony becomes possessive to the extreme. He will not let anyone near Gina since she is like a child to him and the only thing pure in his life. In the end his self  obsession results in all that he cares for doing away with him. His business partners want him out of the picture and his sister turns on him, who snaps under the strain of overbearing control. The tragic hero is about to meet his dire end. Pacino explodes into an inhuman rage as he faces his foes as he is unwilling to accept defeat and to relinquish power - power which he had always wanted  results in a gruesome death under the statue which epitomises the mind- set of Tony Montana  The world is yours to own'. The explosive rise met an explosive end, indicative of the time bomb that he was. It was only a question of time.Oliver Stone has delivered a script which is in tandem with his style. We have the central character with virtually no redeeming characteristics and as usual a solid message fro the audience. All the supporting cast are inextricably linked to the life of Tony Montana and some issue warnings which he chooses to ignore because of his insatiable thirst for power. Stone shows that there are rules to abide by and a self  obsessed conquest for power will result in the possible loss of all that we care for. We are shown how people are obsessed with material gain as an indication of success in America. Pursuit of the American dream must be done with circumspection and respect for people, no matter how great the appeal of the superficial perception of success. Also of note is that the story flow is unabated and well beyond interesting.The name of the movie, Scarface', is not used throughout the movie. Its purpose was to serve to illustrate the depravity of Pacino. He cannot escape who he is. He is bad and the scar is indicative that he will not change. The tragic hero's journey is one of doom, and Stone indicates this at many points throughout the story.The movie starts off with a documentary feel to it. This relates a sense of authenticity and sets us well into the timeline. Although the events are dramatised, this start assists the audience in accepting the hatred that is evident in the movie towards people like Pacino because they degrade the Cuban people and lower the American quality of life. The movie accentuates this affect and creates a sense of human tragedy, tragedy offset by two opposing systems  communism and capitalism.The supporting cast all deliver excellent performances. Robert Loggia is good as the seemingly weak drug boss from which Pacino derives justification for his path to success. Pfeiffer is believable as the smart wife who may not have full control of herself, but is confident enough to tell it straight, much like Montana. Steven Bauer shows us how a wise guy playboy of Cuban descent should be portrayed. Even though only a small appearance, we can see the talent F. Abraham Murray. He plays the weasel dealer whom no-one can trust and fawns to the big players.Gangster stories if well crafted sell well to audiences. The appeal of people living on the edge outside of society's acceptable norms, living the high life is conducive to the big screen. They are larger than life and their emotions make for creative character interplay. All this is evident in Scarface. Not all gangster movies have to be about the Mafia and this is the best one outside those oversold stories.",Null,1,2,22 August 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Hoisting the Jolly Roger.
","Most genres suffer the effects of booms and depressions associated with audience fickleness and the current trend. Only the Action, Thriller and Drama genres retain any sense of stability. Therefore the large  scale investment in a movie which does not have the benefit of a boom period is a risky one. Pirates Of The Caribbean' is an attempt at regenerating the pirate movie with a movie so bold that it even has a sub  title thus indicating the intent of future development of the concept. The pay  off could be big or it could be a major loss. The achieved success is a consequence of the producers doing their homework. If it was a gamble, it was a confident one.The elements of its success are numerous, but the one's that got the attention were the story, the acting, the characters and the visual feast. No single element took centre stage and an excellent balance was struck which ensured that audience attention was not diverted by any one element being stronger or weaker at any point in the movie. Bruckenheimer's production style is well suited to a movie such as this and his experience in the production of several Hollywood blockbusters must have significantly decreased the risk factor.The story was a rich one that flowed gracefully introducing new characters at opportune times and providing sufficient obstacles for our heroes to overcome. This was crucial considering the movies length, although this time length is becoming more acceptable to audiences of today who are adapting as blockbusters are now being produced with involved stories which create greater character development. This is good for moviemakers who may sometimes find it difficult to condense stories to the allotted time limit.Suspension of disbelief was a subconscious one since the audience knew that it was watching a story which had the fantasy of a children's book. This is a natural component of stories about pirates since they conjure up an image of outlaws living outside the natural realm. Past stories captured our imagination as we were told of these barbaric beings that slipped out from under the shadows and plundered returning to their dark realm only to return to strike another hapless target. The great expanse of the ocean abound with uncharted territories and riches to plunder accentuated this quasi  romantic image.The acting on show perfectly set aside each character as an individual who added to the story in their own way. Johnny Depp gave a style to his character that would have been amusing for the younger audience including enough expected character of a pirate so as to keep it in line with the story. As defined by him, pirates would have been something akin to rock stars in their time. This interpretation would have made it easy to be contrived which would have ruined the opportunity created for an original character. This was definitely not the case as the lines were sufficiently sublime and the acting was restrained enough so as to avoid a transparent performance. Let's not forget the assistance provided by the make  up department in the form of eyeshadow. Which self  respecting aspirant rock star would not have black eyeshadow? Our conventional image of a pirate was not portrayed here and this task was left to the character of Jeffrey Rush.This characters entrance was tantalisingly held back as the audience were given entertaining clues as to the character of Barbossa. Lines like he was spat out by hell' served to create an image of extreme depravity and insatiable greed. When we see him for the first time, this image is smoothly slipped into with restraint similar to that of Depp's. He is the archetypal pirate with which the audience will readily identify. We even have the characteristic Aaaaarrr'. As with the character of Depp, there is also originality although more in line with the producers' conception of the character rather than the acting adaptation of Rush. The parrot is traded in for a monkey. This is in tandem with his hyped up image of evil since the monkey looks more mischievous than a parrot. A pirate who is supposed to be the most evil of all must have the most mischievous companion of all.Who also gave a good performance and was consistent throughout. She did not fall into the trap of being too fragile and thus becoming a Scream Queen. Instead she developed into a heroine as she took the battle to The Black Pearl'. The originality evident in the characters of Depp and Rush was not adapted here which did not bring too much disappointment since she retained enough presence in their company. Although she looked like a clone from Titanic', she gave enough adventurous spirit and was therefore not as fragile as a rose'. Excuse the pun, it was hard to resist. The producers were right in casting someone who had a tried and tested look with the audience, but in doing so did not build on the originality as delivered by the leading men.The pirate movies that I have seen in the past all seem to visually fantastic. This one does much to continue this necessary trend. The world of the pirate is something otherworldly belonging only to our imaginations until some moviemakers give us their graphic depiction of this. The sets are at times spectacular in bringing this world to life. This movie does much to satisfy one of the requirements of the big screen which is to take our senses to another level. After all, the big screen is not ordinary  it is grand. Why use a Mako as a prowler of the deep when you can use a Hammerhead.Pirates Of The Caribbean' is an enjoyable movie, but it is not particularly memorable. This was probably not the ultimate aim of the producers. Audiences are looking for quick fix panaceas to their daily stress and in depth storylines do not provide this. The movie was aimed at profit  taking in the short  term. This means that the movie would have to be devoid of messages, but high on family amusement. This allows the producers to target the mass audience and thus make the movie more bankable. It is important to note that the story itself is not weak, it fact as previously mentioned it is a rich offering many avenues for entertainment. It does, however, fall short of the ideal for the stage that it graces. The grand stage requires a story of greater magnitude, which will entertain as well as teach for generations to come. Notwithstanding this fact, there are at present certain economic realities that the producers are paying attention to. Hopefully the future holds greater prospect for stories down the generations.",Null,0,0,17 October 2003
Alexander," A Biopic Of Noteworthy Achievement.
","One of history's' most notable figures once again graces the grand cinema stage. With a massive budget, an accomplished director and a newsworthy ensemble cast, one would expect a positive opening. This was, however, not the case. In fact, critics have slated it and many viewers have vociferously voiced objections. Despite the negative attention, as a fan of Oliver Stone's, I found it difficult not to enjoy. Against this background I will discuss the salient points.Alexander's sexuality is a core issue. The inclusion here is for me to bring forth a real impression of what Alexander was like. Indeed as Alexander creates the empire in his vision, he begins to experience dissent within the ranks, his sexual tendencies lean more towards men. At one point of his life, not included in the movie, Alexander considers suicide when Hephaistion dies and therefore some of Alexander's behavior is a consequence of what he was.Stone has signed himself some artistic license with the portrayal of Alexander's mother. Angelina Jolie takes to the task admirably. She uses a Romanian vampire  like voice while adorning herself with snakes - a consequence of her religious tendencies. Her voice is what distinguishes the character and I am sure that Stone liked the look of Angelina's prominent lips, attractive - mind you, as it accentuated the image of a serpent. This portrayal displays a manipulative woman with intent against her husband, Prince Philip. Jolie gives us an entertaining insight into the motivations of the mother. We see her impact on Alexander.The flashback to the death of his father is done to illustrate how the event affected him. Story flow is crucial but given the length of the movie and the fact that we were given further insight into the character of Alexander, it was the appropriate thing to do. This as an influential factor on Alexander's drive and ambition was critical and well highlighted.The high points of the movie were the battle scenes and here again we see the strategic use of Alexander's extensive history of battles. The first one at Gaugamela is indicative of the height of Alexander's leadership. He takes on an apparently insurmountable force and displays single mindedness to kill Darius in the field. His tactics proved correct as Darius fled. He was the heart of the Persian army  without him they ceased to function as a cohesive unit and thus folded.The camera work is panoramic and emphasizes the tactical battle by displaying the opposing forces with their deliberate placement and order. The close  ups display the ferociousness of the encounter and the brutality of war in those times is clearly depicted. It also helped to indicate the glory of this great time in Alexander's life. The soaring eagle as a metaphor for Alexander's greatness was at no time more relevant than at this battle.The final battle at the Hydapses River showed his deep  set belief that he was the son of Zeus. When the lines started to retreat, he charged forward and crashed into selfless attack thus motivating his forces to follow. The next scene was a defining one for Alexander. He turns to charge an elephant, undaunted, driven by rage and self  belief. His equally brave horse, Bucephalus, rears up to face the enemy and the two are momentarily frozen in time facing each other like bitter enemies. The image represents Alexander's drive and ambition and his unwavering bravery against foes far greater in size and number. It is the most endearing one of the movie. The image of Alexander in the minds eye of Stone.A justifiable point is that the accents did nothing to serve the biopic. I do understand that Stone was trying to illustrate the cosmopolitan nature of dialects, but the obvious European accents only served to distract the audience from the story and yanked us from what was a seamless story flow. I did get used to it, but the impression did linger long after leaving the cinema. Although it was not enough to ruin my enjoyment, it is a detractor and the attempt did not follow through.What interested me after seeing the movie was to access if Stone was still delivering after being many successful years in the industry. The best comparison for me was to compare two scenes which depicted the soul of the movie. The first is the eternal image of a soldier in 'Platoon', arms open to the heavens crying for the loss of innocence and tragedy of the Vietnam War. This while listening to the melancholic soundtrack forever etched on movie history. It was an enigmatic image, simple in design, masterful in delivery.Already touched on is the confrontation with the elephant. Although the scene itself has the same effect, the lead  up to this scene showed camera effects by the way of red tint and is followed by Alexander being carried away on his shield in grandiose fashion. It is this added complexity that Stone has added to his work that seems to be an influence from 90's Tarantino work that makes me favor the scene from 'Platoon'. It seemed more pure and unadulterated. The point here is that although the unique craftsmanship of Stone's is still strongly evident, it seems to have taken a new direction by way Tarantino.Knowledge for the sake of knowledge is an exercise in futility. A dictation of history serves a lesser purpose and it does not move man forward. Greater understanding of great figures in history can only enrich us. This fact as well as the fact that the life of Alexander could not be adequately displayed given the time constraints that the big screen has, shows that Stone chose the correct analytical path to portray a character that has obviously occupied his mind for most of his life. In an era of remakes and sequels, it is most welcome.",7,0,5,19 January 2005
Troy," The 'Not The Choir Boys Show'.
","If there is anything the poster was going to scream at you, it was that this is going to be one of the biggest movies of the year. In the cast department, we have Brad Pitt, Orlando Bloom, Brian Cox, Eric Bana and Peter O'Toole. When quality actors are brought together on the same production, you know that it has to be something special. Then there is of course the director, Wolfgang Peterson who is synonymous with movies that display his penchant for realistic craftsmanship. This is no more admirably displayed than in 'The Boat'. The team list and epic sequences brings comparisons between it and 'Ben Hur'. In my opinion, it will not surpass 'Ben Hur', but you will find no better way to be spellbound at the movies this year.One cardinal rule in the art of movie-making is that you must capture your audience within the first ten minutes. Enter a stand  off between two great forces led by determined powerful Kings. A dispute settling challenge is agreed upon and out steps a snarling Herculean warrior waiting for full blooded action. The Kings calls for our hero and he is eventually tracked down sleeping off a good night with the women. He snaps up the challenge and nonchalantly makes his way to the battlefield. A malevolent grin cracks across the giants face as he eyes out his diminutive opponent. It begins and Achilles dodges the spears and leaping into the air buries his blade deep into the colossus's shoulder who falls to the dust. Oh, and by the way this is for a kingdom. Interested yet?A movie of such grandeur necessitates CGI in order to field a great attacking army. This is delivered supremely and we are aghast at the magnitude of the force. The explosive impact of the massive battles that take place explode across the big screen as we witness a titanic struggle between an army thought to be invincible and a gargantuan drove of soldiers at the service of a power hungry king. Although some of the CGI is noticeable to the practiced eye, it did not dilute the realistic effect.The individual battles were well coordinated and it is obvious that a great deal of planning and preparation had gone into these scenes. They indicated the supreme skills of Achilles and the brute strength and courage of his followers. The only evident fault here was when the Greeks landed on the beaches of Troy; it was noticeable that these scenes were slightly speeded up in order to capture the ferocious pace of the battle. While understanding the purpose here and it is essentially a good idea, the speed reduced the realism effect. Fortunately, this effect was used sparingly throughout the forthcoming skirmishes.The scene between Prince Hector and Achilles' cousin was another well prepared scene and it showed the lack of battle time that the cousin had. His inability to keep his balance and poise led to his death at the hands of a revered opponent. This would prove to be the turning point in fortunes for the Greeks as Achilles was now going to put the rift between him and the King to one side as he sets to avenge his cousin.The story was an encapsulating one. We have the hero on the side of a grossly ambitious King who wants all the credit in history for the conquering battles that are undertaken. They are against a King who is virtuous, albeit naïve, and leads his people with respect and honor. Prince Hector is the way Achilles should be. Although not as great a warrior as Achilles, he is a noble one who fights for his own survival and that of his people rather than for notoriety. This is a classic character situation where the opposing forces are opposite in nature and their interaction will influence their outlook. It is Achilles the hero, who learns from his journey. The characters turning point was witnessing the risk that the King took in trying to give his son a decent burial. Achilles realizes that his lust for immortality within the annals of Mans history books is at the cost of his own humanity and the love of a Princess.His revelation motivates him to sends his soldiers home as his battle was now a personal one for love and not the glory of the battlefield. During the invasion of Troy, he searches only for the Princess and when he finds her, his passion for war is lost and in its place was his passion for her. Her cousin attacks him and although processing the skill to kill him, he does not. He was no longer the self  serving bloodthirsty warrior, but a man who had saved the woman he loved and had now achieved the honor that a great warrior should have. This tragic ending was indeed a fitting conclusion to the story and it made its impact on the audience.The performances were all good with the ensemble cast delivering the goods. No  one stood out, but this is indicative of the fact that the actors were all of a high standard rather than someone not putting in an outstanding performance. Brad Pitt was ideal for the role of the hero as the audience could see the good in this warrior and the lessons learned did not seem out of character, but rather as inevitable. Pitt's nature was thus exuded. Brian Cox was a natural for the role of a power hungry King and his affinity for the role is plainly evident. The audience can sense the pleasure that he takes in playing an evil, powerful character as he revels in being somebody outside the norms of his regular life. Who can forget him as the original Lector in 'Manhunter'? Many a critic thought that he was better and for me that is no surprise. It was good to see Peter O'Toole and although age has softened his eyes thus making him amenable to playing the role of a compassionate king, he still has an obvious air of authority. Indeed the movie had a cast worthy of it.Wolfgang Peterson has yet again delivered a story that virtually all can see. Despite the lavishing of violence and romance, the movie appealed to both genders, something very necessary for blockbusters. His craft is showcased once again as his skill at delivering realistic scenes and sets is graced upon the audience.Watching an epic movie is a great way to spend some of your spare time. The strong emotions that they evoke as well as the spellbinding visuals will keep you entertained from the introductory narration until the rolling of the credits. Producers know that people like to escape to another time, another place and engage themselves in a story of a hero that they would wish to aspire to. Unquestionably, grand historic periods are formidable settings for this to happen and tales of valiant warriors have spellbound people down the ages. No movie as big as this would have been appropriate without a message. It would not have done justice to the scale of the project and ultimately all truly great stories must teach as well as entertain. We see that personal glory at the cost of humanity is unfulfilling and does not attain true honor in the writings of Man. Like Achilles, if we all listen, we can learn.",8,2,4,30 May 2004
The Terminator," Um, Excuse, Mr Terminator, Sir. Let Your Head And Your Rifle Move Together To Meet The Target. You Won't Miss So Much  Sorry'.
","Master storyteller James Cameron, brings to the big screen one of its most memorable characters. Although not his original intention for the role, we are all thankful that an agreement was reached to have Arnold play the role of the Terminator rather than the protector, Kyle Reese. This casting proved to be the crucial element that ultimately gave the franchise the ability to continue for many years to come. No disrespect to Lance Henrikson who eventually found a role almost tailor made for him, that of the man with a dubious gift in Millennium'. The movie is also testimony to the art of screenwriting giving us rich characters, an original story and insurmountable obstacles for our heroes.The task of commenting on The Terminator' is hardly a grinding task. Besides the fact that it is such an enjoyable movie, there is not much to complain about in terms of its craft. Many successful movies are a product of having the writer and director as being one and the same. The writer is able to create a visual form of his own text and the end product is his own vision. There would have been few problems here of scenes not adding value to the story or the image not bringing the character fully to life. These skills are not always endowed to the moviemaker, but it is heaped on in Cameron's case.Right from the first scene, we start to realise that this is more than an above average action movie. The inciting scene indeed gives momentum to the story. We see the apocalyptic future and fully grasp the dark, foreboding threat of the machines. The genocidal machines crush the skeletal remains as they advance relentlessly without emotion, doing only want they were programmed to do  wipe out the resistance. The narrator voice has a tone of impending doom thus heightening the sense of tragedy. The story is set in motion for the battle to continue back in time, our time. This phenomenal piece of writing is also included in the tagline. Almost bordering on cheesiness, but it is so well done, it gets away with it.The characters are all of purpose each with defining characteristics that bring the character to life. Sarah Conner is the sweet, innocent waitress battling to cope with life in general. Hardly a sterling foundation for the mother of the future! This does succeed in making her more vulnerable to the Terminator and the vast differences in their character help to set the story of our unwilling heroine against the seemingly indestructible machine. As the character develops and the final confrontation is at hand, she realises her destiny and rises to the challenge. Linda Hamilton is also well cast here, in fact, superbly. She has a look of innocence about her that changes to one of menacing determination, a switch done with believability  a trait necessary for the translation of the character of the story. Indeed her presence was missed in the third movie, no matter how charismatic Arnie is.Then we have Arnold as the Terminator. If ever there was a role suited to an actor, we have the prime example here. Arnold has the name that shouts action. He has a thick Austrian accent that sounds distinctly robotic whenever he uses it. Arnold does not speak much here. He didn't need to since we were all ears whenever a line exited his lips. Remember I'll be back'. His massive frame served to accentuate the indestructible nature of the character. If ever Sarah had a worst nightmare, it would seem a cakewalk next to this guy. In summary, Arnold had all the necessary traits for this character and it has quite rightly become his signature role.Michael Biehn is a regular in a Cameron production and plays the role of Reese very well. We can see that this is a man who has suffered and his determination not only stems from a deep  set hatred of the machines, but from his love for the woman who will be one of the leaders of the resistance. Being slight of frame making him look more like a lean soccer player makes him less of a challenge for the Terminator. In fact, even though he knows he has to ultimately face the machine, the best he can do is run. He always seems to be clawing onto survival and in the end he dies in the final stand against the machine.It would of course be impossible to say that I had satisfactorily completed my comments without a mention of the scene at the police station. This scene is the Terminator's defining scene. It is here that we see him for the cold, heartless, single  minded killer that he is. It all starts with Arnold's most memorable line and then the doors crash in as the Terminator careens into the station with his stolen car. The machine sets about his task with ruthless intent. He shoots anything that gets in his way as he searches for his prime objective. This is all he exists for and it is all he is programmed for. Like personal computers that process its input commands, he follows his input command regardless of all that stand in his way. After all, he is a Terminator so it is as they said in the sequel  nothing personal.The story is uncomplicated, but nonetheless stimulating. Several science fiction concepts are used here, namely, time travel and machine dominance. This blend ensures sufficient obstacles for our heroes and it is also interesting to note that the Mcguffin is not Sarah, but her unborn child. This also creates a sound opening for the second movie that picks up on this in the future where another chase is on, not for the mother but for the young John Conner. The story ensures that the violence is meaningful  a machine programmed to kill would relentlessly pursue its target vanquishing all before it. Nothing to tease the brain, but the craft and intent in the story ensures that the audience is fully engrossed in the movie.      
As man advances with computer technology, the more relevant this story will become. That is why the story was able to continue and audience demand grew. Science fiction takes a known scientific concept and dramatises it. The concept of machine autonomy has now graced our screens in two monster productions  The Terminator' and The Matrix'. The reality of machines in our lives today goes beyond our conscious and ignites our unconscious fears, that is, the fear of losing control of our world and of ourselves. These deep-rooted fears manifest themselves as inspiration for movies such as this. This is not such a bad thing since master storytellers are able to exploit these ancient fears and deliver sublime entertainment that will continue to provide enjoyment across the generations.",9,0,0,14 March 2004
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Act Three In The Art Of Entertainment  The Final Duel.
","So it had finally come to be  the final chapter of an epic story. The attention span of a movie audience has always been a limiting factor for the movie industry. When taken into consideration with the time and cost constraints that influence audience attendance at the movie theatre, we can well appreciate the fact that the series concept well accepted for television, is not considered bankable for the movies. A potential investment in the continuing adventures of' by production companies would result in the application of financial prudence, meaning that the preference would rather be to concentrate on one story and if box office success warranted it, the production of a sequel to take advantage of a potential cash  cow. This is still a solid norm today, although more risks are being taken in stories like Star Wars'Good stories will always attract audiences to the theatre, but to bring them back for another chapter, it will have to be special. The principle of high concept would certainly have more relevance here. Of prime importance would be the unique challenge of creating story flow throughout the chapters with each setting the platform for the next. Keeping audience attention throughout the chapters is necessary in order to inspire audiences to return and follow the continuing adventures of their heroes.Star Wars' is one of those few special stories that can meet all these challenging requirements. It introduces new characters throughout the chapters which created enough interest for the audience. Each chapter ended tantalisingly thus giving impetus to the next chapter. Stories involving mystical worlds with wizards, princesses and knights duelling always seem to captivate audiences thus making them particularly favourable for the series format. This is also evident with Lord Of The Rings'. Lucas's unique adaptation of ancient worlds to that of the future has firmly claimed an established place in cinematic history.The third chapter offers much in the way of strengths, but unfortunately also in the way of weaknesses. As a result, it does pale in comparison to The Empire Strikes Back', but it still falls short of disappointing. Lucas had gone much further in trying to delight the younger members of the audience. There may be method here to the effect that being the final act, it should act on a happy note. It may also be that feeling freer to apply the child within him due to the mass audience acceptance of previous characters, Lucas added more comic characters. Even if we consider the first point to be correct, and I personally feel that it is the second, the story has been weighed down with comic characters, which may annoy the older audience. These characters take up much screen time in the third chapter and it began to take on a pantomime  like style. This undermined the battle between good and evil as the threat of the Dark Side seemed to take a back seat to these characters. If it were not for the greater role that the Emperor played in this chapter, it would have been disappointing.
The Emperor is a sublime manifestation of the Dark Side. He absolutely oozes dark menace which serves to accentuate his great power. The eyes beneath his cloak projected ominous intent. Even his surroundings mirrored the evil that he is. His window is in the shape of an unshapely spider web symbolising the disorder and chaos of the Dark Side and hideous design also indicated to us that we were now in the presence of evil. The room is devoid of ornaments or furniture making him appear more purposeful in his evil intent. He does not reminisce or luxuriate  he exists only to dominate and rule at all costs. His priests have the appearance of demonic minders who submissively attend to their masters needs. The Emperor is purposeful in motion  confident in who he is and the outcome of his fiendish plan which is unfolding in the presence of his adversary.The stand  off between the Emperor and Skywalker did much to increase the perception of the Emperor's power. He seemed to be in total control and was getting the necessary reactions from Skywalker. It is these scenes which rescue the movie and keep it in line, not only with the box  office success of the previous chapters, but also as a story. It gave the continuity to the chapter that was necessary due to the excess inclusion of comical characters. It did not address the balance entirely, but served to anchor the storyline. The Emperor was a character which served to draw on the line of evil characters such as the Bounty Hunter and of course, Vader. The balance of characters between the good and the bad side was generally very good. But for me, it was the Emperor that tipped the balance of memorable characters in favour of the baddies which already benefited from strong audience appeal due to characters like Vader. This is indicative of the fact that stories such as these require immense characters as opponents for our heroes. This creates a greater obstacle to overcome thus maintaining audience attention as they attempt to conquer an insurmountable force. Audiences also enjoy these characters since they solve their problems ruthlessly and with impunity. It may be costly to us in reality, but we can fantasise about it. We imagine the face of Star Wars' and it is not Skywalker.The comical characters had their place in the movie, but they were greatly over  utilised. Some of them were silly, especially at Jabba the Hut's cave. The Special Edition only served to exasperate the matter. Alien's continually belching was a joke that was replayed as if we would never tire from the novelty. If their comical nature and screen time had been toned down, they would have strengthened the movie rather than weakened it. A sound balance between the comic and seriousness of these characters was struck in the previous chapters. It was a pity the same was not applied here.Notwithstanding the above criticism, Return Of The Jedi' is an entertaining movie with a satisfying conclusion. The assault on the imagination launched by the story tapered a bit here. but it remained to be a movie far above the average. The final chapter had despite it's weaknesses, given us a movie which was still one of the best at the time. A traditional story had been adapted and as a consequence of this adaptation, cutting  edge technology not only needed to be used, but had to be upgraded. Lucas carried this application through to all future projects involving Star Wars' and although their impact has, and never will be the same, we will continue to look forward to the continuing story of Star Wars'.",9,0,0,12 October 2003
Alien," it's the first and it's still the best in the series.
",the aliens franchise is a good example of the fact that the first in a series can virtually never be undone.one reason for this i believe is that the success of 'alien' was largely due to the fact that knowledge of the alien was limited and we never did see much of it.this created great tension and suspense because we never knew it's capabilities or where it would reappear.sequels lost this advantage and relied on a higher body and alien count.this is also the reason why 'halloween' is also by far the best in the series.,8,0,1,29 April 2000
Predator," The movie that made the word 'Predator' infamous.
","John Mctierman and company have laid claim to the word 'Predator'. They have created the ultimate hunter/killer roaming the universe looking for worthy prey and this time it's Arnold (Dutch), and his able military team. This movie is fast paced enough to please action fans but also skillfully creates suspense by keeping their stalker in the shadows so that the predator feels ever present and is just cautiously eyeing and selecting it's prey. Bit by bit it is revealed to us until it's full horror is unleashed in the climatic scene.The casting of this movie is near perfection, except for Shane Black who was offered a bit part when he was not needed for screenwriting duties. Arnold is the ultimate screen superhero. He is seemingly invincible and his overbearing confidence makes his casting as a leader natural. His muscles, thick austrian accent and powerful name have helped him permanently claim roles as his own - Conan, the Terminator and of course this one. Without Arnold in the sequel, it was always going to pale in comparison. For the screen superhero it was obligatory to have an adversary from outer space. Only in this way was Arnold going to have to use all that he had to overcome the invader. This is the match - up that moviegoers will want to see - the world's superhero trying to save us from a threat from outer space. Although this sounds reminiscent of the 40's and 50's when Hollywood capitalized on people's fears of a threat from outer space, this movie far transcends those B grade movies.His crack unit is composed of some of the most outlandish characters the action genre has to offer. There is Jesse Ventura, the loud and attention seeking ex - professional wrestler. His gun says it all - everything is over the top with him. Sonny Landham is the indian with a sixth sense. It is this contribution that adds to the movie's suspense - he senses the Predator and quickly comes to realize that the team is up against something stronger than them. This unnerves the others since Billy is always the calmest and is able to access the enemy and give his team the advantage. Then there is of course the seasoned screen professional, Carl Weathers. He is always in top physical condition and this along with his smoothness, is ideal for his role as the ex - ops boy who becomes a collar and tie agent - a job that requires different values and he now uses the men he used slog in the trenches with. This grouping together of such strong personalities must have created a very competitive atmosphere which would have translated into better performances. Notwithstanding this fact John Mctierman must have had a big balancing act on his hands.Arnold's contribution to the movie was not just that of the leading character, he also recommended Stan Winston after the first Predator creation was curtly rejected by John Mctierman. His creation embodies all one could imagine that the alien predator could have. It has missiles, spears, blades as talons, camouflage, infra - red eyesight and can deftly move within any environment. Of particular note is how the predator looks. It is the personification of our nightmares. Our fears tend to exaggerate our monsters and they are endowed with unnaturally long claws, glaring evil eyes, excessive mandibles ending with unusually long teeth and they are of immense size and strength. This is spawned by Stan in his alien predator creation. Undoubtably he is the man best able to create these monsters that haunt us at night.Although there are scenes that remind you of the 70's slasher flicks, it is never done for the sake of it. These scenes show us how deadly the predator is and how it can swiftly attack and disappear without trace. The fact that highly trained team members are being killed in this way makes the rest feel vulnerable to the point of cracking. Unlike these slasher films the acting is better, no - one is helpless and these scenes fit into the story and are not the excuse for it.The climatic encounter is fantastic. Dutch uses all his capabilities to overcome the predator, but when facing his end the predator sizes him up as an opponent worthy enough to face unarmed. It had found a prey that by facing in unarmed, pure combat, it would prove itself as the true warrior. It's drive to be the ultimate warrior is it's undoing since it affords Dutch the opportunity to lead it to a trap.Also worthy of mention is the powerful military soundtrack thus setting the tone for a meeting of two great forces where one will stand and one will fall.",8,0,0,25 May 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," Every Beginning Has An Ending  Just Kidding, Folks.
","If there is one thing Revolutions' is not, it is not controversial. One look at the user comments here and you are left in no doubt as to the plausibility of this statement. Usually controversy arises from the inclusion of taboo subjects in movies, but this is definitely not the case here. The Matrix' machine has given itself the concomitant reality of its own hype  elevated expectations. For a large group of people their expectations were not met. No matter how good a story is, and I am of the opinion that this is one of the best that I have seen for a long time-  with some minor glitches  if you elevate expectations to such a high level as is the case here, expect some disappointment. In reviewing this movie, I shall outline some of the factors that have contributed to the wide range of differing opinions. Characters and their problems provide impetus for the story. Without these elements, there is no story. This is obvious, but there is a point to be made here. Therefore the makeup of the characters and the problems that they have to solve will virtually be the sole source of success or failure. In Revolutions' the problems that the characters encounter are of great magnitude thus keeping the audience spellbound. It is therefore the characters themselves, that is, the changes that they have undergone as a consequence of their past experiences that should be the centre of the controversy.Neo is the movie's hero and it is his journey that the audience is most concerned with. He will lead to story to its ultimate resolution. The most important character change here is that he is more vulnerable and not the superhero that he was in Reloaded'. Neo faces his challenge as a man and not as a digital entity. Hence the obstacles that he faces are more daunting. The problem with this is that much of the action that he was involved with in Reloaded' was not evident until the climatic scenes. In fact, Neo has far less screen time than the previous two chapters. This is also true of the other two central characters  that of Trinity and Morpheus. The directors may be looking to the future and in a sense passing the torch' of the Matrix' story to other characters. It did much to make Revolutions' a better story since it involved more characters with greater problems, but it certainly did not appeal to fans of the past two chapters.Trinity's character did not change much from Reloaded', except for the cut back in screen time, but Morpheus changed dramatically from the previous chapters. Now he is far more uncertain about the path of The One' and as a consequence is not the ever present strong leader. Other characters take over this role as the strong leader as Morpheus is relegated in status. What this did was to take control away from the one leader who believed that he had the answer to the ending of the war. It created tension for the audience since leaders less visionary than Morpheus controlled the actions of the defenders of Zion. The idea has a sound foundation in reason, but it did weaken the character of Morpheus who was central to the story. A better balance could have been obtained by giving him more support from some of the top leaders. This would have created greater character conflict and would have not undermined the threat of the machines.Another big change was that of the composition of the action. The others were kung  fu orientated and this one was largely a straight shoot  out. This meant that much of the signature special effects were minimally apparent here. The special effects that were now on show were very good and did much to display the power that the machines possessed. But this alienated fans of the signature special effects who may have felt deprived of what bought them much enjoyment.Not only its composition, but its duration has changed as well. This is particularly evident from the opening scene where Neo is trapped between worlds whereas the other chapters opened up with the signature special effects and action. It was thus evident from the start that the story was going to move much slower thus emphasizing a dramatic build up rather than continuous action. This allowed for the development of other characters which further evidenced the continuing story of the Matrix'. This change to the action would not have been what many would have expected. It is probably the downturn in action which is the source of most disappointment to many users. Over the course of a long story, there will be changes to allow for character development of the heroes and also for the introduction of new characters. Character changes are very difficult. These changes are inevitable to the continuing story and the characters we see in later chapters will be different to the ones that started the adventure. A balance is thus necessary. The basic nature of the heroes needs to be retained in order to keep their mass appeal. In meeting this balance some of the changes were not appealing. The one that did not appeal to me was that of Morpheus. This is also due to the fact that Lawrence Fishburne has a natural leadership charisma and this strength was thus underscored. In essence, his basic nature was not adequately retained.The introduction of new characters is necessary in order to stimulate audience interest and to add freshness to the story. It is the addition of the leaders of the resistance that was disappointing. They were emotionally one  dimensional and were not good for the Morpheus character in terms of undermining his strong leadership appeal. This was probably also due to the fact that they wanted to project gutsy fighters for the invasion, but it was at the expense of one of the central characters of the story.The wide range of opinions regarding this movie is almost as interesting as the movie itself. That is why I have dedicated most of my comments to the reasons for this. A story which is going to be bigger than the characters necessitated a gradual progression into the introduction of new characters and the ending of the adventures of our old heroes. This meant that Revolutions' was going to have a greater mixture of action and drama. Revolutions' was thus a step above Reloaded' in terms of story, but as a consequence lacked enough of the spellbinding, imaginative impact of the original. On the whole it was a fitting conclusion to the story and the many questions that were left unanswered will be a subject for the continuance of this great story.",Null,0,0,23 January 2004
The Shining," Kubrick's contribution to the horror genre.
","From the pen of one of the most prolific writers to the direction of one of the most obsessive perfectionist directors. Stephen King's imagination has inspired many movies and Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of The Shining' is the best that I have seen. Given the fact that many top directors have bought King's work to the big screen, we can thus see how good Kubrick really is. Kubrick has made many top class movies, but this one probably captured audience's imagination the most. It also became a signature role for Jack Nicholson, which is further indicative of the status of this movie.The soundtrack was not to inspire gross sales or to add greater revenue by way of soundtrack sales. It was utilised with one purpose in mind, and that was to significance to the story. The DVD edition includes the compositions in the chapter headings thus indicating how each particular composition was used to manipulate audience emotion and add value to the storyline. How do you portray the terror of the mind using the big screen? The ingenious use of camera shots and angles certainly helps and this was used. But overuse of this will underscore the effect the director is trying to create. It will translate to the audience as someone who is trying too hard and it becomes pretentious and this will be foremost in the audience's mind rather than the effect itself. Music has the benefit of creating the impression that some overbearing, ominous evil is present, but we cannot see it. This effect is used very well in the opening scene where Nicholson is travelling to the Overlook Hotel. An overhead shot is used with the car seemingly overpowered by the landscape and this is accompanied by a chilling opening number. Here the two are combined to enhance the overall effect. Nicholson is heading towards an enemy far stronger than him and a sense of impending doom is initiated for the audience.This is also used in the scene where Danny sees images of foreboding terror at the hotel. Excessive use of blood can be cheesy, but it's usage here has a definite part to play in moving the story forward. Danny picks up the image of terror that the hotels inhuman occupants have to show. This image is shown whenever Danny senses something terrible is about to occur, most notably in the scene where Nicholson confronts his wife after his experience in Room 237. The blood indicates the presence of the terrible beings at the Overlook Hotel and shows the true horror that they wish to impose. There is very little sound of gushing or none at all  just the use of dark sound which rises as the terror is shown thus excentuating the image of horror for the audience. Although a shocking image, it is not out of place and clearly delivers the message of the foreboding terror that is about to unfold.  
Kubrick has a firm understanding of how to visually translate the terror of the mind. His work can be compared to that of the well-known writer of the 18th century, Edgar Allan Poe. Poe had a great eye for detail and also used very little dialogue in his horror stories. He usually portrayed the story from the viewpoint of the himself thus creating reality for his stories. He described the inner workings of the mind when subjected to terror, sometimes terror self  imposed by the frailties of the main character's own mind. Kubrick has the same style, only he uses the big screen, which is sometimes more difficult when attempting to create this illusion. Kubrick made the necessary use of dialogue, but his mark was made by using other elements to project this effect. This is a complicated task to perform and one can well understand why he used Nicholson in the key role. Nicholson used his eyes to great effect with a little assistance from his devilish looking eyebrows. This is evident in the scene where he stares seemingly into nothing, but we can see the evil intent taking hold of him. There are no weaknesses as far as the performances are concerned. Nicholson is brilliant as the writer who already has problems with his wife from the start. We can see that this is a man who is impatient with her lack of intelligence and becomes less tolerant as the ghostly inhabitants increase their influence and guide him towards their diabolical objective. We can see that Nicholson relished the role of the demented axeman. He was able to fulfil his fantasy of wreaking havoc on society, which he does with boisterous aplomb. Duval is good as the wife who is gradually subjected to terror by Nicholson and it is the ghosts that finally decide to take control of the situation, revealing the full perverted horror that the hotel holds. Kubrick gave her a psychological drubbing in order to ensure that she looked unlikely to handle the situation. This may have been unpleasant for her, but it was essential to create a character that would seemingly falter against her husband and the ungodly spirits. Danny was superb. He showed maturity beyond his age as he was able to portray someone who had to deal with these images of terror. When Tony, his name for the power that his mind has, attempts to tell his mother through Danny that his father has escaped, he was able to keep his concentration throughout a long scene. This scene hung the suspense on a shoestring, which snapped when Nicholson starts to chop the door down. Working with children has it's own unique demands which were well met. Scatman added a lot considering his small role. He helped Danny deal with his images and the connection between the two offscreen oozes onto the screen.Without doubt this is one of the most prominent horror movies to date. Most satisfy a fast  food mentality whereby cheap thrills and abuse of special effects is evident. If these are the fast  food, then The Shining' is the escargot. It is in a class of it's own. To watch it once is to not experience the full effect of the movie. The sound of Danny's tricycle as it crosses the carpet onto the wooden floor and back again, the sense of isolation, the approach of the tennis ball and the terror within the eyes all take on a greater significance when viewed for a second time. These all helped to make evidence of the terror of the mind.",8,1,2,16 August 2003
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Blown away by the blockbuster.
","What can one say about a movie that about which everything has been said? How can one find something critical to say about a movie which is as close to perfection as one can make? These are two questions which you have to ask yourself when submitting a user comment for a movie like this, and it is no easy task. The answer to the first question is probably to just go ahead and say your say and tell yourself that although it is only a drop in the ocean, it is a drop nonetheless. The second question poses a far greater challenge. Answers to this will be very short indeed and may be included if only to satisfy a desire for a sense of completeness. As far as finding points to cheer, it is difficult to find a place to start. Terminator 2 has its rightful place in cinematic history and when seeing its high rating on the IMDB site, I still feel that it is underrated.The first item which I wish to discuss is what can be attributed to its longstanding appeal. I believe the answer lies not solely, but to a large part due to the fact that James Cameron can combine a flowing story with high action and spellbinding special effects. The story acts as a precipitant for the action and not vice verse as is the case with most movies within the genre. We have character development, moral dilemmas, and character arcs. All these story elements combine seamlessly to leave audiences spellbound.Character development will be examined from the point of view that the characters from the original have changed over the years. The experience would have left its indelible mark and would have changed their outlook on life. This is particularly evidently in Sarah and John.Sarah's physical adaptation is not the mirror of her emotional adaptation, which it far exceeds. The imminent day of horror weighs heavily on her shoulders. Her way of telling the world has been one of desperate outbursts culminating into an attempt to destroy Cyberdyne. Her knowledge of the future and her militant attempts at trying to divert it has meant that society has seen her as mentally unstable and she is rightfully detained for treatment. Her physical adaptation is surprising for audiences since she is identified with her meekness in the original and the TV series Beauty and the Beast'. She is now a soldier, ready for the onslaught against mankind and her son. It was a logical progression for the character and inspired interest since there was emotional conflict between being a mother and preparing for the battle ahead. This change was a monumental factor in the sequel being the superior.John was not born in the original, but the character that is introduced to us is feasible to the story. He has a mother who lacks emotional stability and he is now in the care of apathetic foster parents following her detention. John is now a rebellious youngster operating outside the rules of society. Self  destruction is his escape - a far cry from being the saviour of mankind.The Terminator was a positive change for Arnold. It put him in the place of the hero. It must have been tantalising for Arnold who probably wanted to soften his image as an out and out action hero. The role was perfect for that. The Terminator although retaining the same basic programming of the original, that is, to remove all obstacles permanently, had to protect a child. He was now on the side of the good. This entailed the concomitant respect for human life, something the young John wanted to teach him. Given the fact that this was a virtual complete turnaround from the original, the plot created the opportunity  and it worked. This change was the platform for the moral message. No matter how grim the future may seem, we must still respect human life.The T1000 is the Terminator sent to prevent the victory of man. He is the replacement for Arnold, but we do not notice this since Arnold and Patrick are so strong in their roles, they stamp their authority and lay claim to them. Patrick is phenomenal as the T1000. His mechanical walk illustrates robotic efficiency and malevolent intent whilst emphasising his confident power and purpose. His piercing stare indicates his resolute drive to accomplish his sole objective.The character arc is the journey of self  discovery that the character has taken during this particular film. Sarah was still battling with her demons as she once again became a vigilante and goes to terminate the computer programmer. She had little faith in mankind, faith that was ironically rekindled by the Terminator. The machine had learnt to identify with humans and if the machine was capable, then mankind was capable of acceptance of others. She had progressed to retain her humanity and to recognise the humanity in others.John had momentarily gained a family, albeit a machine for a father. It had given him a sense of purpose and realisation of what was to come. John had come back onto the rails and when they had changed the future, he was given a sound foundation to live a normal life. The Terminator by way of his learning processor had commanded a sense of human emotion. It was this that gave hope, the kind of hope that Sarah was looking for. This was a quantum leap from the original Terminator.The moral dilemma, already touched on, is that no matter what the future holds, human life must be respected. It is not a case of tough situations require tough solutions. Respect for human life is the foundation of moral rights. The right to live is fundamental to mankind.Another interesting issue was the one concerning the changing of the future. There is no fate, but what we make' was the impetus behind the story. The machines had developed the capability to do this, but it was used against them. It presents a dilemma to us, knowing what the future is and how we should deal with it. These actions define us as human beings.It is these story elements that meant that the movie ensured it's longevity for audience memory. Mission Impossible 2' is an example of how a lack of story substance can make a movie forgettable, no matter how good the action sequences are.The only possible fault I could find is during the introduction the Terminator approaches you as the credits are completed. This could be construed as cheesy, but it could also mean Prepare for an action rollercoaster ride'. Cameron had well omitted the imperfections of the original.The Terminator is an icon within pop culture. The ability to solve our problems with impunity and overwhelming destructive power is a fantasy for many. Our fascination with creating something that could turn on is has long been immortalised in storytelling. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein' is a good example. We have grown up on similar stories and the good ones endear themselves to history. This story surpassed its original, a feat achieved by the cinematic few  Godfather 2' and Star Wars 2'  are the esteemed company it keeps. It is deserved.",9,1,1,22 August 2003
Collateral," Big Lights, Bright City. SPOILER
","Neither is prolific, but the creation of a movie that will grace DVD rental stores down the years is a one of time, effort and respect. Collateral is indeed a movie that transcends the norm and epitomises the work of these two moviemakers.Besides Vincent and Max, there is a third character consciously created by Mann. This is of course the city of Los Angeles. The evidence of this is within the opening scenes where we glide gracefully above the city soaking in the vibrant life of the city as if it were a living organism. The silky ambiance has an undercurrent of a city coursing with life and an unquestionable hint of danger. Then we meet up with Max - a true part of the city. What better way to reveal the character of the city than through the eyes a taxi cab driver. It is they who see every corner of the city and meet its people from every walk of life. They are an innate part of the city, a direct tap into its lifeblood.Another scene designed for the character of the city is where Vincent and Max are drawn in by the mystical image of a wolf crossing the road in front of their cab. The danger of the city reveals itself. It is the true predator and master of its domain. Although the city does not overwhelm the lead characters, this scene shows what strength the city has and can bewilder and excite the others. This is indeed within the fabric of the story, but one cannot help but notice that Mann has put his own personal experience and impression of the city that captures his imagination.The city is further revealed when we are taken to a seedy suburb, a jazz nightclub, a discotheque and finally an upmarket apartment block. The diversity of LA is exposed and gives our characters numerous settings with different obstacles and characters. All this with a character who is the very fabric of the city  Max, and one that hates the city  Vincent. The richness and diversity of the characters thus mirroring the city. The more they interact the more we learn about the city. The character interaction between Vincent and Max is reminiscent of the characters of the 80's movie 'The Hitcher'. There is a strange connection between the two which is noticeable in the final scene where Max seems moved by Vincent's most feared death. The differences between the characters seem to lock them together on their perilous journey and which will ultimately result in the demise of one of them. The casting is not too dissimilar to the type of thing that Martin Scorsese would do. He is a master of conflicting images and messages. Here we have the two lead characters played by actors who would be synonymous with vastly different characters. Tom Cruise is usually the hero and more often than not capitalises on his looks. Vincent is, however, the villain who wears a non  descript wardrobe and is wash born grey. Completely atypical, thus a new challenge for Cruise. Jamie Fox is a natural typecast for a comedic character, but here he is a mundane, unimposing, melt into the background kind of guy. Sometimes this type of casting, especially for the main star can be a mistake. However, here it is perfect for the story as it accentuates the essence of the city which is one of beauty and danger, not all what it seems and what we know. It also commits the actors to concentrate on their acting as they are outside their comfort zone and under the microscope. Their performances as a consequence are virtually flawless. In fact, their unnatural circumstances became their natural acting circumstances. We normally expect Cruise to deliver, no matter what the character and thus the unknown factor was Max. He was even more under the spotlight and he delivered. Jamie Fox has now made his mark.The supporting cast were all good, the most noticeable of which was Jade Pinkett  Smith. She is the last target of Vincent's and her apartment block is the setting for the climatic scenes. It is her character that brings Max out of his own self  preservation instinct and drives him to take on Vincent at his own game. The frailty of Pinkett - Smith adds to the danger and gives Vincent the edge. This creates a greater obstacle for our hero this providing greater tension for the audience. High profile movies with high profile personalities always invite a wide variety of opinions. This is a natural consequence of expectation. The main problem area seemed to be the extent of exaggeration of some scenes. This is of course true. The suspension of disbelief is stretched a bit, especially in the final shoot  out scene and the fact that Vincent sticks with Max despite the obvious risk to himself. Also Vincent seems to have no fear of exposure in public as he executes his targets in full view. For me, it was not too distracting and did not adversely affect the story. After all, we do not go to the movies to see ordinary people in ordinary situations. The characters we wish to see are larger than life and transcend our normal limitations. There is a line to this, but I believe Mann flirted with this line, but did not cross it.A scene that raised the movie was the nightclub scene. Here we are mesmerised by a series of fleeting images of wild gunfire and multiple targets and villains. We have the cops, the target and the gang out to nail Vincent if the job turned sour. In between all this is the crowded and the swirling lights, glass and smoke. It created a chaotic, sporadic scene where the outcome for the lead characters seemed to be out of bounds. The pace was raised and the stakes were higher. Our characters were now riding a crest and never faltered from here.When Max first meets Vincent, he openly proclaims his dislike for the city and particularly notes the apathy and the loss of identity within its walls. He had heard a story where someone died on a train and was not noticed for several blocks. In the end Vincent dies alone on the train as it carries on along its route. The villain had met with a worthy end. It was the death he most feared in the city he most hated.Not intended to be one of the blockbusters of the year, it is nevertheless one of the strongest movies of the year. There is obvious attention to detail here, particularly with the casting and the scenic views of the city. The audience is suitably drawn into the world of LA with superb acting and artful directing. Mann does not get carried away with the portrayal of the city and blends it in with the characters providing a tense background for the action. It is deservedly highly rated and should leave the audience feeling that were entertained.",8,0,0,24 October 2004
The Last Samurai," And James Brown Said Living In America, Oops, Sorry  Japan'.
","The epic movie seems to creating a lot of interest among producers and when we see this we can wonder no further. These movies are very moving and draw you in with their deep characters and even deeper stories. The dedication required from cast and crew will be far higher than for the regular popcorn movie designed to put butts in seats. If well done this does translate to the audience who become fully engrossed in a good story and will remain transfixed to the very end despite these movies usually long time length.
The Last Samurai' is indeed an epic movie displaying all the necessary characteristics indicated above. Unfortunately the translation to the audiences did not carry through to the Academy and this will be largely due to the fact that The Lord Of The Rings' trilogy has come to end and is due for a few necessary awards. I am not going to look at the look at the reasons for the few Academy nominations, but rather at what aspects made this movie capture my imagination above others.As good as it is - it is flawed in a few places. The one area of particular note is the beginning. It is a logical start to the movie which quickly introduces us to some of the main characters and tries to show us the mental torment of Nathan Algren (Cruise). He is plagued by the memories of the atrocities of the American army when they fought the Indians. The right direction was thus set as this enables the story to ease quite nicely into an interesting clash of cultures later on, but at this point the moviemakers seem intent on quickly moving us through an important part of the film where we see the characters problems of conscious and the shame he holds for his own culture. The scenes splutter across the screen as we are ushered through the obligatory character aspects to the juicy part of the movie which for me is where the unprepared Japanese trainees have to face the formidable Samurai's. From here on, the movie flows gracefully until the final scenes.During the final stand of the Samurais', some of the Japanese soldiers start to exude pity and remorse in the face of the slaughter of their fellow countrymen who are after all only taking a stand for the Japanese way. The acting here is not of the highest caliber and nearly ruined what was a most grand climax. It appears hammed and although this was the right emotion to portray for the moment, it was not strong enough especially in the face of other performances.  Despite the opening scenes, there is a real effort to tell a meaningful story. This is evident through the restraint exercised over the characters. The bad guys do not have cheap punch lines, but as in the case of Algren's superior officer, seems well schooled and sophisticated. The love interest between Cruise and his fallen foes wife is completely devoid of the high testosterone charged skirt chasing reminiscent of some of Cruise's past characters. The only hint at sexual yearning was when she lovingly dresses him for the final battle. The final scene consists of a loving look into each others eyes. This clearly indicated the intent at making a meaningful movie which may mature on DVD stands like a fine red wine.The epic movie needs an epic character and this is provided in the form of Cruise. Complexities of character for the lead role are necessary. To this regard, he portrays a man distanced from his own culture which practices the end justifies the means. The culture which he falls into the capture of has elements which he does not approve of, such as their apparent lack of value for life when they must take their own life in the face of defeat. But he warms to them since they are standing against the predatory culture of which is so ashamed. The Americans and ambitious Japanese see savages while he sees a people who wish to retain their ancient ways which are pure in intent. The characters obstacle of acceptance is great since he has killed one of their best in battle but was ultimately defeated meaning that he should have taken his own life. His spirit and discipline wins them over and they accept him as a warrior worthy of their own. The epic character had found that their belief in similar principles endeared them to each other.Cruise as always has a commanding presence throughout and after the opening twenty minutes truly shows that he has what he takes to win an Oscar. Although it will not be this year, his dedication to making each project that he takes on a success must mean that he will eventually win it. I have always thought of his name on the poster as a quality stamp of approval. Even his less popular movies are still commendable. The Last Samurai' leaves no room for doubt that this is a man who takes his craft very seriously indeed  for a movie of this magnitude, it needed to be.
Authenticity is important for the epic movie and we are not disappointed. The sword fights are well rehearsed and the cinematography is well orchestrated here as we do not stay long with one shot which heightens the action as well as not allowing for evidence of unskilled swordsmanship  not that these guys were that bad, though. The costumes were striking and did not appear to drown the characters as sometimes occurs in period movies.
The acting was solid throughout with a few minor noticeable exceptions. Connolly was entertaining for the short screen time that he occupied. Tony Goldwyn was good as the self  righteous and pompous Colonel Bagley. The Emperor was portrayed very well by Nakumura as being weak and open to influence from the greed of the West. At the end he realizes his heritage and sees the traders for what they are. A lot of acclaim has gone to the supporting actor, Ken Watanabe, and although rightfully bestowed it is for me as already mentioned, Cruise who leads from the front.Depth of character and depth of story is the strongest redeeming elements here. We have a character haunted by a tortured past, disillusioned with his culture and sells' his skills, which were used for suppression, for money. He is captured by a group of rebels who may be different in many ways from himself, but have the same sense of disillusionment with their culture which is losing it's purity for greed. He had finally found himself and was willing to die for it, as were the Samurai. The epic movie must mean that the hero has to have something that he believes in so dearly, that he is willing to die for it. Only by doing this, will he find ultimate fulfillment and become the gallant hero that the audience were wishing for. This story is delivered with a juxtaposition of cultures skillfully crafted leading us not only to the end of the hero's journey, but to teach us something about ourselves as well. Indeed, this is upper end entertainment well worth a place in the DVD cabinet.",8,0,0,10 February 2004
From Hell," Its All In The Wrist Action.
","One of the greatest murder mysteries of all time, a timeless whodunit, necessitates the big screen interpretation thereof to be of high caliber. From Hell' is certainly well done and most interesting to watch. When the subject matter is so well known and it's history has been meticulously pieced together accessible to millions the world over, a significant challenge is presented to the moviemakers. How do you inspire interest in a story that has been heard many times over? One way would be to look for a novel that takes one of the theories and adds unique qualities to the big players of the time through which the story unfolds. Now what you have is a captivating story of interest to those in the know as well. Of course, acquiring the services of a talented cast will be of assistance too. When this is put together with surreal imagery and artistic sets, you have the formula to take up the challenge.The moviemakers do much to exploit the audience perception of the time which is evident from the opening statement that the Ripper sees himself as the one who will be credited with giving birth to the Twentieth century. Although this illustrated the mind  set of the character that they had chosen for the Ripper, that is, one of a man who had lost all appreciation for humanity for the mastery of his trade, he is an iconic figure of the 19th century and the boldness of his statement serves to accentuate the gravity of his evil presence.
Audience perception is largely due to the rise of media at the time which achieved mass production and the story of the murders spread like fire. Whitechapel was in a grip of terror since gruesome details were of the present rather than a stale story. The rest of London read with fearful interest. His will  o  the wisp nature and methodical brutality was quickly immortalized and even today new documents are rising to the fore further titillating public interest.The opening sequence reminds one of The Crow' where we are shown a cruel, inhospitable part of London where people are expendable commodities and civil society would have nothing to do with them. The blood red sky relayed a message to the audience of the bloodshed that lay ahead. We then descend into the city and witness the degradation in the form of drunkenness and street women being exploited. A problem that some may have is that the characters are not realistic enough since they are too pleasing to the eye. However, we are not dealing with a realistic account, but a movie that must identify with the audiences perception of the times which has been molded by countless movies and novels. The Hughes Brothers would do well not to deviate from this and they did not. The use of this kind of imagery was presumably taken from the graphic novel. Not necessarily a direct excerpt, but its use helped to tie in the world of the graphic novel with that of the big screen. In that sense the movie should appeal to readers of the novel as well as presenting a new fictional interpretation of these events to other members of the audience. Current CGI technology certainly has the ability to enable a transition of this type. As with The Crow' the moviemakers have successfully brought to life the pages of the graphic novel.
An impression of the medical fraternity of the time was given as being social beings above all others who were specimens for their diagnosis. The scenes with the Elephant man illustrated this. They were devoid of empathy and utilized the tools of the trade to achieve the required ends of the clan. This was the crux of the Ripper's actions and was the object of a few mesmerizing montages. What was noticeable here was that the gore was limited to suggestion and the savage attacks were indicated by the flash of a sharp blade. This was a cinematically acceptable way of capturing these gruesome scenes and most of the movie rides on the ominous presence of the Ripper rather than on the extremities of his crimes.
His overbearing presence was also achieved by scenes where we see the back of the Ripper and hear his voice as a hissing, malevolent evil. When we discover his identity and his eyes turn to pitch black, we are given an image of the dark, raging evil entity that resides within. The eyes rather than his actions are used to better describe his nature. This is done again in one of the final scenes where we see him in confinement with milky eyes  no longer a threat, devoid of means to do anything.
The cast was full of notables and all aptly contributed to the movie. Johnny Depp was a good choice for the lead role of Detective Abberline. His natural and genuine sense of empathy was an entertaining stark contrast to that of the Ripper and the members of the clan. He is also a staunch individualist who will do things on inspiration rather than to the book thus fitting snugly into the shell of his character. Ian Holme got the transition from being the physician at the twilight of his career (a harmless old man), to the demonic, twisted Doctor with an evil purpose in the confrontation scene with Depp without hamming it up and was utterly convincing. Depp's sidekick, Robbie Coltrane, is an outstanding character actor and is always memorable. Ian Richardson has a strong penchant for playing powerful people with dark ulterior motives and delivers once more. Heather Graham perhaps did not do enough with her role, but did not pale too badly in comparison to the strong cast.The fear of the stalker who strikes without warning and leaves his gruesome acts for all to see has a special place deep in the sub  conscious of society. He attacks our sense of security and rekindles our ancient fear of the unknown. Jack The Ripper was such a being and his heinous acts seemed to be not of man, but of an evil entity. Horror will always be a walking ground for the man who got away. Even if they do solve the case, which I doubt, the continued deliberation as to his true identity will continue to inspire future tales of the world's most infamous night stalker.",Null,0,1,23 February 2004
Bram Stoker's Dracula," A worthy adaptation of a classic tale.
","Fans of the old Dracula movies and of the original Bram Stoker novel may be it a little disappointed since the movie is not entirely purist.However,old stories have to be adapted to be told to modern day audiences.I believe that this movie achieves this. Firstly,It is visually stunning and the use of surreal images and creepy shadows accentuated Dracula as being a man of great power and of deep emotion.Also the emsemble cast delivered the acting goods,particularly Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins.The emphasis on romance  augments the story since I believe that Bram Stoker as well as other novelists must have fantasised of a love for a woman being strong enough to conquer death. I believe that Francis Ford Copolla has paid tribute to one of the most well known stories of all time.It will be well worth the rental money.",7,0,0,7 May 2000
Platoon," DEFINENTLY OLIVER STONE'S BENCHMARK.
","When viewing this movie years after it was originally released and having the oppotunity to see other Oliver Stone projects,it becomes evident that he probably climaxed with 'Platoon'.Artists from other entertainment disciplines have produced work that they will always be judged against and which they never have surpassed.A case in point is Micheal Jackson's 'Thiller'.Although his other offerings are good in their own right,they do tend to pale in comparison.I feel that his later projects suffer as a consequence and although it may not seem entirely fair,he set his own high standards with 'Platoon'.There are a variety of factors that make this such a good movie.The first is the background music which conveys a message of seemingly overbearing tragedy about the loss of innocent young life.The tracks used to capture the era blended in with the screenplay and did not detract from the movie as sometimes occurs with more product oriented movies that choose tracks that will sell CD's and not to accentuate the mood the director may wish to convey.The emsemble cast showcased here is very talented and many of them were to make an impact on the movie scene,most notably Johnny Depp and Charlie Sheen.Tom Berenger and William Dafoe play their parts perfectly which is essential since their conflict was a central theme.There were no weak performances which can usually be to the detriment of a good movie.My own personal analysis of this picture is that the conflict between Tom Berenger and William Dafoe is a representation of the situation in America during the Vietnam war.Berenger represented the hard core anti-communist war machine which viewed American soldiers as part of the machinery to eradicate the enemy of democracy.Dafoe's character could be seen as the peace loving anti-establishment hippie generation that has a strong moral belief.The friction between these contrasting ideologies divides the camp and a violent result was inevitable.This is indicative of ideological differences in America during the war.Whether my interpretation is accurate is not relevant since it is a thought provoking movie and I am sure that other users will have they own analysis.This is the magic of the screenplay as a art form.Anybody who enjoys movies most add this masterpiece to their collection.I am sure it will be watched many times over.",9,0,0,27 May 2000
Scream," Another original contribution by Wes Craven.
","Wes Craven has provided audiences with original, entertaining work which has left their indelible mark on the movie world. One only has to mention 'Nightmare on Elm Street' for it to be seen that he is a director who has made a massive impact on the horror genre. Both movies had large followings and produced characters that will be long remembered. Creating characters that become icons within a genre is difficult and Craven has produced two. Not only is it because the material is so original, it is also because Craven uses a talented cast who appeal to present day audiences. He is able to blend classic horror, that is, the bogeyman with the mask who stalks the main characters from the shadows, with the window dressing provided by photogenic actors and actresses which is obligatory for today's movies. In effect he has made horror movies appealing to mass audiences  something that only the very best could do. This has been accomplished by way of numerous means. As previously mentioned, the cast - window dressing - are usually fresh, bright, young talent. They can act. There is also a story of note. The central characters are all engrossed in conflict with each other and this is not only due to the fact that the characters have been created with a lot of personality differences, but also because they are given real dilemmas. A good example is in 'Scream' where Sydney is struggling to come to emotional terms with her mother's death and she then also has to deal with Gale Weathers who questions the legitimacy of her testimony which put away the main suspect. She also has to deal with her mother's promiscuity. This is a great basis for conflict and has a high degree of believability. In the hands of two good actresses, it enhanced the movies plot.
The suspense is of such a high level, that you could argue the fact that this movie leans more towards suspense thriller rather than horror. Although it is argumentative, I believe that this movie is still rightfully classified as horror rather than suspense since the suspense is a catalyst for the horror. The suspense sets us up for the horrific scenes. The suspense thus provides a service rather that it being the recipient of a service.In accordance with present day adaptations of teenagers on screen, they are insightful with understandings of relationships, but not the emotional maturity to deal with them. This is well used within 'Scream' as the main characters have insight into the 'rules' of horror movies, but still put themselves at risk for the climatic sequence where they are secluded and vulnerable although probably feeling safe in numbers.Neve Campbell is excellent as the fragile Sydney Prescott. She has an extremely fragile way of speaking which makes her more vulnerable to the villain. She aptly portrays the emotional turmoil which seems to sap her characters strength. Her ability to show the dilemma concerning her testimony towards Cotton Weary aids in the audience acceptance of her trusting of her boyfriend - would she be able to deal with another questionable accusation?  Given her portrayal, we think not.Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard are equally commendable. Ulrich does not get too offbeat when his characters true intentions are shown. This keeps the transition more plausible. Lillard remains as over the top as he was before which thus keeps his character consistent and hence believable. They were the best villains of the franchise and were a healthy contributing factor to the first movies success and its reputation, earned quite correctly, as the superior.You could not comment on 'Scream' without mentioning Kevin Williamson. He is the one who after all provided the seed for the most successful horror movie. Although he penned a few of the movies that followed on the success of this one, this is still the gem. The audience is kept guessing throughout and suspects are numerous meaning that some members of the audience may have changed their minds on several occasions as to who the villain is. Who guessed that there were two of them? Not many, of that I am very sure. There is ample plot here to keep attention as well as multi - layered conflict. This gave a new dimension to the slasher flick and redefined the genre for the 90's.This movie is not reverential of the genre. It rather pokes fun at the 'rules' that moviemakers kept to in order to operate within the genre. Success of a movie meant that others would follow and many similar movies were produced which were mostly a paler version of the source of inspiration or source of plagiarism, as would have often been the case in order to secure sound revenue. Audiences became indoctrinated with the same ideas and thus familiarity gave birth to contempt. Although this is true, the rules' must be kept to even within the most original script. A fine balancing act needs to be struck. It is important to note that all genres have their own set of rules which must be abided by if audiences are going to identify with the movie. Notwithstanding this fact, movies made for the drive - in theatre age, the B grade support flick, generally followed these rules' without much attention to plot and were therefore ridiculed. 'Scream' makes the most of this. It could have so easily fell into the spoof movie trap, but does not thus securing its place in movie history. Of more importance, it reignited the genre which had long been without a leading torch. The last one was Elm Street' and this is not coincidence that the director was Wes Craven. He is that good.",7,0,0,27 July 2003
Halloween," The one that started it all.
","There are a number of labels attached to this movie which have led to it being incorrectly classified. This is because the movie is so good at evoking terror that it accomplishes more than what is given.  
The first one is that this is a slasher movie. Although it can be seen why this label became attached  a bogeyman with no motive killing teenagers  there are more than enough reasons why this label is false. Firstly the body count is low. Carpenter relies on keeping the audience in a state of high tension by suggesting something horrific is about to occur rather than having it actually occur. This is done by letting the audience know where Michael is and not the teens. He also lets Laurie sense the ominous presence and allows her to catch glimpses of him. The audience knows what is there and the knowledge that they have suspends them in horror as they see and know the evil that stalks Laurie. The unwitting heroine is heading for a terrifying encounter with Michael and the audience is along for the journey. A sense of powerlessness pervades them which accentuates their terror. Carpenter has thus created a movie that can be classified more as terror and horror rather than a slasher flick. It is not in the same class as Psycho' but parallels can be drawn. Another label is that of the babysitter killer. Michael does not stalk babysitters in particular. He is motivated by a dark obsession to kill his sister Laurie. The fact that Laurie and one of his victims are babysitters is not central to his drive. As Dr Sam Loomis, his psychiatrist, diagnosed he is catatonic seemingly oblivious to the world around him existing only for one purpose  the right moment to stalk and kill his sister. This inexplicable drive is another source of terror for the audience. They have a fear for the unknown and when the unstoppable evil has no motive, this unknown element creates a more inhuman killer who will kill all who stands in his way.The fact that Carpenter is the screenwriter, director and soundtrack composer is the most obvious reason why this movie is so good. He created the words and translated these into images. He then composed a soundtrack to accentuate what he was attempting to achieve with the images. Thus we do not have three separate visions of the movie and Carpenter uses his multiple talents very well here.For me it is the soundtrack that lingers most on the memory. We have heard the same soundtrack effect in Jaws'. As the killer approaches it's victim, the soundtrack pitches in volume and intensity as more instruments are added at a greater pace. This accentuates the illusion of an ever closing killer which escalates with audience tension. The deep piano sound darkens the atmosphere. This is probably Carpenters greatest talent and the one he enjoys applying the most. The fact that some actors put in very weak performances is indicative of the fact that he pays more attention to other things  fortunately for us an excellent soundtrack.Michael's mask has been the face of terror for years. The killer who does not show emotion and is almost featureless means that you cannot reason with this man or appeal to any source of emotion he may have. The mask makes him less human and thus detached from ordinary man. By referring to Michael as the shape adds to this effect of creating an evil entity rather than a mad human being. This same effect is evident in Jason and Freddie, other horror movie villains, but they are behind the most infamous mask of all  the Captain Kirk mask of Michael.The performances range from good to mediocre. Donald Pleasance was the archetypal opponent for his evil characters. He gave believability to some of the cheesiest lines in movie history. Examples: `he had the blackest eyes, the devils eyes' and `he's gone, the evil has gone'. His contribution highlights our impression of Michael as pure evil. Jamie Lee Curtis is less convincing, but her weak performance makes he seem more vulnerable to Michael and thus indirectly adds to the illusion.This movie is a horror classic and is wholly undeserving of the horrendously pale sequels that it gave birth to, with the possible exception of the first sequel. Things got worse from there. Anyone wanting to see how one person can combine the various elements of filmmaking should look to the original one as a great exponent.",8,0,0,23 June 2003
Blade Runner," Another Ridley Scott classic.
","What strikes me most about this movie is the creation of a futuristic earth.Scott's vision of the LA of the future makes this movie not seem to be outdated even at almost twenty years after it was released.Ford and Hauer's strong on-screen presense does not overawe the screenplay and the supporting cast did not come across as the usual obligatory characters who were just there to keep the play going.They definently added their own magic. Although it may be slow-moving to some,this is what makes most good movies brilliant.Tension build-up and identification with the main characters is thus fostered. Blade Runner is for me a true cult classic and well worth the rental money.",7,2,4,2 December 2000
A Nightmare on Elm Street," You Can Sleep  But You Cannot Hide.
","Many horrific characters have terrified audiences down the years, but only a few seem to touch the subconscious profoundly enough to return to the big screen many times over. Universal produced many monsters in the early part of the last century. Most of these were subject to severe constraints such as the ability to communicate. They were monosyllabic since their inability to communicate was indicative of the fact that they were not human and we could not reason with these beings that only existed to wreak havoc. The only one with any sense of sophistication was Dracula. This is the one of the prime reasons why this character has such strong appeal. Wes Craven has now given us another character that is worthy of recall to the big screen. Although lacking the sophistication of the past vampire characters, he can interact more on screen thus creating entertainment beyond the Universal monsters. He had many wise cracks, which also was necessary for audiences of the Eighties  a prime requirement for the superficial era. To an audience which had been bombarded with slasher flicks as a consequence of the success of Friday 13th, it was a progressive step. For the audience of today, we now have Freddy Vs Jason' which is an interesting idea, albeit a sensationalist one. There are many reasons why Freddy Kruger has captured the imagination of audiences. The first and most obvious is his appearance. His burnt features make him have the appearance of a monster. He is human in shape only  a disfigured monster hell bent on revenge. The trademark finger knives are also an image of terror. He does not just want to kill - he wants to maim and destroy. The stalker with the axe' now takes a fiendish pleasure in his vicious deeds. Killing is not enough. He has to torture his victims and see their pain. His demented psyche needs to be satisfied. He is above the aimless slayer and there is method in his madness. A far more deadly assailant. Another is the children playing outside his house. Their presence is an ominous one as the image of pure innocence is now a messenger of foreboding evil. A sense of impending doom is created since we now see the all-consuming power of Freddie's evil in his victims. His past victims are now an element of psychological torture for his next victims. Although this has been an element of stories of the past, this image becomes a more striking and harrowing one when we learn that he was a child killer. Self  mutilation is another feature of Freddie's psychological torture. In one scene he slices his fingers off. This accentuates the impression of invincibility since if he can harm himself in such a way, how can we hope to harm him. His form also changes as he contorts himself into painful images. This is indicative of the predator's adaptation to his hunting ground. He holds great power over his victims. Warriors of times gone by used this tactic in the field whereby they would endure pain in adorning their body with aggressive artwork showing their commitment to wage war. Freddie is the supernatural caricature of this ancient practise. The final element is part of the high concept of the movie. Sleep is escape for us. Peaceful sleep is secure sleep. This security has now been invaded by the being that Freddie has become. Our final hiding place has now become a place of terror. We cannot call for help in this dream world. It is now the world of Freddie that is at his every whim. The monster is now seemingly invincible. Our final refuge is the predatory ground for the evil killer and the prey is not equipped to defend against attack. This element of originality is the defining one of the Elm Street' movies. The performances are very strong as one comes to expect from a Wes Craven movie. The leading character could easily have been hammed up and appeared contrived. Robert Englund plays the role of Freddie with obvious enjoyment. We can tell that he calls on that side of him that wants to strike back at the system and it thus came naturally. The danger of identifying with a role of this nature has, however, been realised since seeing him in other roles he seems to be out of place. The audience is accustomed to seeing him as Freddie. Typecasting is not always necessarily a bad thing. The actor gains recognition and success, but once the story has run its length, he will struggle to achieve similar success and his typecasting will limit his ability to successfully engage the audience in a character of another story.The young cast all perform well with a notable debut by Johnny Depp. In the past, acting performances were secondary to the necessity of the look and the scream as the mad axeman delivers his coup de grace. This is definitely not the case here as believable performances are given. Craven also sets his movie apart from the others in the same genre by using up and coming talent and maximising their potential. When creating movies that have to capture the imagination, good acting becomes a greater necessity since a hammed up performance will not draw audiences into the story.   Besides a good debut performance, Depp's end is met in a cult scene where he is torn to pieces in his bedroom. Despite the gore, the scene was not an excuse for a gratuitous violence. It gave an image of the destructive evil that Freddie was. It rose above an obligatory slasher scene because the story was laying down a platform for it by building on the acts of Freddie and the terror that the teens faced increased with each incident. It therefore fitted within the fabric of the story. The stalk and slay movie concept is now being adapted to mans ability to control his environment and therefore conquer his ancient fear of the unseen foe. The monsters are now not only powerful, but have other supernatural abilities. Their menace is now manifold, as these screen monsters have evolved to face audiences and our screen heroes. Our ancient fears are still there, only more suppressed and characters like Freddie have now come to being in order for moviemakers to give rise to these fears and ensure audience entertainment as well as terror. Slasher movies should never be the same again.",Null,0,0,26 October 2003
The Matrix," If George Lucas had made this,he would have been proud.
","This movie is an absolute tour-de-force.It took my breathe away and captured my imagination for weeks to follow.'High concept' is so necessary of big budget productions and the Wachowski brothers deliver.The only weak point is the dialogue and some of Neo's weak comments were most unbecoming of the saviour of the world.This is nonetheless overshadowed by a strong story,awe-inspiring special effects and solid performances by the emsemble cast. To truly appeciate this movie,the only medium worth viewing it on outside a cinema would be a DVD.The DVD is a must for all fans since it provides insight into the making of a mega sci-fi movie.I look forward to the sequels and I am sure that the Wachowski brothers will get back to work in their usual passionate way to produce trilogy- like episodes.Lucas would have loved to have this movie to his name but for me Star Wars is still the benchmark against which all sci-fi productions must be measured by if only for the reason that it is a true trilogy.",8,0,0,22 December 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Act One in the Art of Entertainment  Rise of the rebellion.
","To put this trilogy into perspective, it should be compared to another of great success. The one that I am referring to is of course The Godfather'. An appropriate analogy for comparison would be that of a family visiting an art gallery. They come to the The Godfather' display and the parents take a step back and seriously consider the portrait. The children take a look but soon loose interest and start to nag their parents ushering them to move along. The father has his hand on his chin  the customary body language of a man in deep thought and looking intellectually satisfied moves on the next display. A big hurrah for the young ones for the next artistic offering is that of Star Wars'. They go 'Wow' and the parents attention is also drawn in  the child within touched. They all move along with a facial display of joyful appreciation.Star Wars' was pure entertainment  an example of the art in entertainment in its purest form. It appealed to all, no matter what colour, creed or gender. The imagination is emotionally hauled away on a journey relieving the traveller from reality. There was no sophisticated effort at delivering a message or any subliminal images necessary of interpretation. This is the epitome of big movie entertainment  screaming Hollywood, but without the big name actors. An aspect of Hollywood which if used would have detracted from the audience's attention to the engulfing story and adversely affected its ability to transport the audience to an unknown world. The other aspects were well included. Firstly, it is loud, it has dazzling special effects, and there are glamorous actors. A reflection of the style of American culture and the movies success is indicative of the worldwide acceptance of this culture. Hollywood is indeed the hub for the exporting of American culture to the world. Although lacking the artistic sophistication of The Godfather', it will entertain even the most discerning members of the audience. One need only ask How many people do you know who have not seen this movie?' to gauge the magnitude of the applicability of the preceding statement.The attributing of the success of this movie to any single element would be wholly incorrect. No element of the movie steals the show entirely as it is the seamless combination of these elements which flow together throughout the movie, one stealing a scene here or there, but each delivering significantly when the movie is reviewed overall. It would be more practical to identify the weakest element rather than the strongest one. The elements that will be discussed are the acting, the music, the story, and the special effects.The acting is the element that is the weakest here. I believe this is due to the fact that Lucas is not a natural director. Writers are asocial by nature and directing is social. This is a natural consequence of each artists make  up and is therefore a strength when this natural consequence is applied to the appropriate trade. All the actors are good but in certain scenes, especially Hamill often had contrived expressions. Given the fact that Lucas never did many retakes or communicated to any great extent with his cast, it is hard to lay the blame at their feet. Ford and of course Guinness rendered sublime performances. Guinness utilising to its full extent the suspension of disbelief necessary for his lines, gave them credibility and life. He was ideally cast as the old Jedi who would pass on his knowledge and experience in order to prepare the young Skywalker for his battle against the Emperor and his dark forces, most notably Darth Vader.The music is my affectionate choice as the number one contributor, but in an attempt to be objective, I have to put my personal sentiments aside as I am aware that a movie of this grand scale needs to have all the elements giving great contribution. This is indeed the case here. The opening scene jolts you awake and you are whisked away by the triumphant orchestra to the world of Star Wars'. It booms away salvo after salvo and your imagination capitulates to the unrelenting attack. As the introductory storyline brings light to bear on the ensnared audience, the music gives the story a sense of grandeur and a spirit of adventure. The words and images are given an elevated status  one which could not have been achieved alone. Memories of this composition will linger for the audience, so powerful it is almost ungraceful, but it never crosses the line. The story is a testimony to the creative writing. The story flows through all the acts and we are transported between them without noticing the start or exit signs. The characters are all different each playing a part in the life of our hero, Skywalker. Many of them are met by Skywalker as embarks on his quest and not only do they add value to his adventure, they all entertain. The obvious choice for the best character must be Darth Vader. He is the complete caricature of evil. His life support system makes him inhuman and therefore seemingly devoid of any righteous emotions. Like the cover of the video indicates, he is the face of Star Wars'. Our hero is given a grand task and many obstacles are encountered along the way before the satisfying conclusion is reached. With great imagination came great craftsmanship and everyone, especially the audience, wins with this one.The special effects also deserve special mention. Any inclusion herein of the impact the special effects of Star Wars' on cinematic history made would add to value to anyone and will probably bore all and sundry. This has been documented exhaustibly. My own experience all those years ago, as I am sure was the experience of many members of the audience, was to go Wow', then Wow' again. They gave authenticity to the storyline and bought the world of the galactic battlefield to life. The opening sequence showed a craft being chased by a gigantic pursuer and the camera rolls by closely thus emphasising its enormity. This effect would have been simplistic in comparison to what we further to witness, but it set the tone. By today's standards, the effects are a little dated, but besides thrilling older viewers reminiscing about the enjoyment felt in their youth during their first experience of the movie, it will still provide enjoyment for the young audiences of today.Lucas has taken an age  old convention and combined it within a relatively new genre and created one of the great stories. Knights battling against forces of evil and rescuing a damsel in distress have always captured the imagination generation after generation. Wizards used their white magic to counter the black magic of the dark forces. They mustered their power from an all powerful source which could only be accessed by the gifted few. It was stories like this that adventurers told their sweethearts and became a part of folklore as a source of inspiration for the weak and helpless. When all this folklore, as well as elements from great stories of old is transposed into the futuristic world of sci - fi, it deepens the fantasy. The timeless appeal of Knights and the fantasy world of the future when used together in a well crafted story will enthral audiences giving them a unique experience and the rolling of the final credits will serve to ease their return to reality from a galaxy far, far away.",9,0,0,7 September 2003
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Act Two In The Art Of Entertainment  The Search For Skywalker.
","This movie achieved an extremely rare accomplishment in cinematic history  the sequel surpassed the original in all departments. Other examples of this are The Godfather' and The Terminator'. Star Wars' and Godfather' were the next chapter in a trilogy and thus were the continuing story rather than the beefing up of an original high concept movie conceived with the sole objective of cashing in on the appeal of the original. The Terminator' was not planned as a trilogy, but rose above the production company cash in norm by delivering a developed story and limiting action sequences to fall into the context of the story. These movies indicate to us that good stories are fundamental to the long  term audience acceptance. Lucas certainly had this in mind. The composition of the next chapter requires character development. Of importance here is ensuring the characters have changed as a consequence of their previous experiences. This not only creates audience interest for the audience, but also offers opportunities for challenging adventures for our heroes. The best example of this is Skywalker. The realisation of his power has given him a sense of purpose and he relishes the opportunity to learn. He retains his youthful enthusiasm and spirit of adventure. Although feeling a high sense of duty, he still has concern for his friends and rushes to their aid. His development as a Jedi Knight has alerted the Empire to the threat that he poses. Vader has relentlessly pursued him and taking advantage of his commitment to his friends, finally manages to lure him into a showdown. This of course led to the memorable scene where Vader reveals his true identity. This set the stage for an engaging conflict in the next chapter. The story can now flow seamlessly thus maintaining the captivated audience. Conflict is what gives impetus to the story and it must be plausible so as to maintain the credibility of the story. It is the prime character driver and as our characters develop, so the conflict becomes greater further motivating them towards resolution. There is no greater emotive conflict than that of father and son on opposing sides of the battlefield. It would be natural for audiences to identify with this. This served to create a solid platform for mass audience appeal. The relationship between Ford and Fisher had grown. Their differences in character had endeared them to each other. The conflict between the two was riddled with weak lines that at times were silly but which probably helped to inspire giggles from the younger members off the audience. It was designed to indicate innocent love. Given the huge success of this movie, the lines would not have gone to waste. Ford was well cast for the role. He is a watered down Clint Eastwood doing it his own way, but as a team player with a strong sense of moral commitment to his friends, much unlike Eastwood who is a loner lacking commitment and with lewd sexual fantasies. Although his character needed to go, the natural family values of Ford seeped into his character. He was not the gunman, but the man fighting for the survival of his family. The acting was the single biggest improvement. Much of this can be credited to the new director. Lucas is a writer by nature and the reticence inherent in a writer may not translate well to that of the director who needs to be outwardly expressive. The most visible improvement for me was that there was a greater menace about Vader. I believe that this was due his less animated style. He was more methodical in method somewhat like a cold assassin. He did not expend unnecessary energy as he ruthlessly hunted down Skywalker. This improvement to the character augmented the dark feel of the movie.Also worthy of special mention was Hamill. Gone were the false facial mannerisms and now we have a performance showing the inner turmoil and conflict. Hamill, with a little help from the director, was growing in stature. The lack of restraint was not evident here as it was in the first one. This was a necessary progression since the character was faced with greater personal conflict and without the restraint we would have had a hammed up offering.An obligatory requirement for sequels is that our heroes encounter different characters on their adventures. This can be a most difficult task, especially when the first chapter was a great success. The idea is to introduce new characters to the audience which would spark new interest as well as being within the context of the story. The new characters of note were the Bounty Hunter and Yoda.The Bounty Hunter blended into the story since he compared well with Vader. This was by no means indicative of a lack of creativity, but was in fact the perfect addition. A character was created that inspired interest, but retained the continuity of the story since he was instantly recognisable as someone who could be in allegiance with the Dark Side. The retention of the story continuity and the addition of originality required inspired creativity.He was human only in shape. We could not see any part of his body thus limiting his identification as an emotional being that could be reasoned with. He was the manifestation of a cold  blooded killer. Although lacking the over  bearing presence of Vader, he was an ominous foe. Characters such as these do not have much screen time. The more we know about our foes, the less of a threat they are. Notwithstanding this fact, he is one of the more memorable characters. In the battle between good and evil, Yoda was the wizard preparing the knight for the duel. He had the characteristics necessary of someone on the side of the good. His animated mannerisms and comical features endeared him to the younger audience and his grim warnings about the power of the Dark Side enthused entertainment for the rest. Guinness had a small part to play in this chapter and Yoda was his replacement, thus evidencing the continuity and originality previously mentioned.The assault launched on the imagination by the original had now been intensified with advanced weaponry. Improvements to the armoury were more emotive content within the acting; new characters which added value to the battlefield and of course the then spectacular special effects. Of particular note is the twist in the plot where the true identity of Skywalker's father is revealed to him. This jolt was not enough to awaken us from our trance  like state of hyper  imagination. The Star Wars' machine rolled on ever conquering, enslaving audiences worldwide who readily accepted their subservience. The stage was graced with a story rich in design and complemented with vivid images. The wait for the next chapter would be a long one.",9,0,1,21 September 2003
