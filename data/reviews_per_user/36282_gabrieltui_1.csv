It," Painfull to watch
","Clearly the writers never read the book. the first scene is the only thing good in this piece of work. you won't see characters development, backstories, tension, their friendship, their worries, nothing. the movie is just some Jump scare crap named It. If you have, like me, read the book and expect to see a good movie based on a stephen's novel, go watch Misery.",1,2,4,3 April 2018
