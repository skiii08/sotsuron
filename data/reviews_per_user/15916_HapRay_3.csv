The Legend of Bagger Vance," Fore! Watch out for flying golf balls.
","I was expecting much more from a Robert Redford film, and I have had some decent screen moments from Matt Damon, but this film never got anywhere. Firstly, you are asked to believe that a former WW I soldier, who now spends his time getting drunk and playing poker, is one of the best golfers to ever come out of Georgia.Thanks to a nosy kid, a woman who inherited her father's debt-ridden golf course, manages to stage a match for $10,000, (Keep in mind that she was stone broke) winner take all, with the improbable matchup of Walter Hagan and Bobby Jones, two of the greatest to ever play the game.  To represent the 'honah' of Savannah, she calls upon our local drunk and former golfer, as well as her former boyfriend (same guy), with the improbable name of Rannulph Junuh. Quite honestly, I enjoyed the name of this character better than the film.Well, here we go. The match is arranged for two days of 36 holes each, yet when the they finish the first 18 holes, it's dark, yet they show the next 18 holes taking place in brilliant sunshine. If you like, and/or play golf, you'll find all sorts of things incorrect in this story. If you don't play, I doubt you'll like this melange at all.Now let's come to 'Bagger' himself. Here comes Will Smith, who is so miscast, it must have even made him laugh. He attempts to portray this 'Is he an angel or isn't he?' character. I can't believe that Redford's direction allowed Smith to give this almost 'silly' portrayal of a down and out caddy, who knows everything there is to know about golf. Even Charlene Theron, couldn't convince me of her role.When you consider parting with two hours and seven minutes of your precious time, check and see if it's raining. Anyone knows you shouldn't play golf in the rain (or the dark either). I guess no one told Redford that.In golf a 'bogey' is a bad score. I give this film, a triple-bogey. That's three OVER par.",Null,2,3,22 October 2001
Lost in Translation," Lost is right!! I need a translator.
","Once again Hollywood rears it's ugly publicity-seeking head and tells us that we will LOVE this 'Comedy'. The best part about this film was the Japanese scenery. It was actually BORING, and I consider myself a very erudite film critic. For some magical, mystical reason, this movie actually was nominated as 'best film'. Wow!I know this opinion is going to get lost among the thousands who have voted this vehicle an 8.0 on the 10 scale, but I don't care. If I can save one movie-goer from being bored for almost two hours, it will be well worth it.The ONLY reason to invest your time in this mess, is to see if you can find an honestly 'funny' scene'. Good luck, or as we say in Japan, 'Bullsheet'.",Null,2,5,23 April 2004
Mulholland Drive," Only if you have 2 1/2 hours to waste.
","There was so much hype on this film when it was made, I simply had to see what the fuss was about. Let me first tell you, that I am a qualified movie critic, and the first time around with this picture,I really wasn't sure what I had seen. I gave it another shot, alone, and with an open mind. I am now wondering what else I could have done with my time.For some reason, Hollywood seems to want to canonize David Lynch. If it were up to me, I would ostracize, not canonize. All his films go off on weird tangents, but this one is way out there. I cannot understand how it has received an 8.1 rating ( out of a possible ten), from THOUSANDS of viewers.Good manners keeps me from the words I would like to apply here...suffice to say, that unless you are crazy about Lynch's work, forget this melange of twelve movies in one.",Null,0,1,22 October 2002
