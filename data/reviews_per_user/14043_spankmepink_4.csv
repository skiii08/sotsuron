Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," R for pervasive, strong, crude and sexual content, boring!
","R for pervasive, strong, crude and sexual content, including graphic nudity, and language.With his wide-eyed, pasted-on grin, thick mustache and loping Groucho Marx gait, Borat is a profane innocent with a will of steel, as earnest as he is devious, someone who is so much a product of his stridently politically incorrect culture that his actions are intended to make us question aspects of our own.I was very disappointed with the movie. I had a few laughs, but it was not worth the money and i would never watch it again. I like him better just on 'T.V.'.Most of 'Borat' involves the man's journey to 'the U.S. and A.' with his producer, Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitian). The trip begins in New York City and ends, after Borat falls in love with Pamela Anderson via old 'Baywatch' episodes, with a cross-country drive to California in a dilapidated ice cream van.",1,276,543,18 November 2006
Stop-Loss," EXCELLENT MOVIE - Down to earth.
","Great movie! Nothing like saving the average War movie. Many people will be able to relate to this movie. Anyone who has a son, daughter, husband, wife, etc. serving in this war. Ryan Phillippe stars as Brandon King, a decorated war hero who, upon returning home from his final tour of duty in Iraq, is surprised to discover that he's just been stop-loss. A legal loophole that allows the U.S. military to extend a soldier's enlistment contract until the completion of the current war. Scheduled to ship back out at the end of the month, Brandon goes AWOL and heads north to visit his senator in D.C. When the senator refuses to help him, however, Brandon is left with only one option: flee to Canada and abandon his country forever, or return to duty.",10,4,9,5 April 2008
Troy," Great movie, did have mistakes. so what!
","Most critics here seem to dissect every second of a movie. Just take all the fun out of it. If its a crappy movie thats fine. This is not. Just tell us plainly why you think a movie is not good, without all the hype. Troy is an action packed epic tale complete with kings, their warrior sons and of course, Achilles, played as a brooding and mostly unwilling soldier by Brad Pitt. For the most part the film excels at locations and scenery, rumbles with some of the best battle scenes ever made but struggles some with historical accuracy. Achilles, son of Peleus, and Patroclus, son of Menoetius (Peleus'brother) were cousins. Other ancient sources confirm these data. Just watch Troy, enjoy it. I loved it! You will LOVE it!",9,3,6,29 March 2005
Music and Lyrics," Drew again plays the flake! what a waste.
","I was very excited about the movie, when i watched the previews. After watching the movie, i was Very disappointed. i love Hugh and drew! Very confusing characters and bad story plot. Both Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore have to fall back on their re-run characters, somewhat. Hugh, the humor he had with the Bridget Jones . Drew plays the flake again! What a waste, this could have been a great movie with better writing and directing. From start to finish this romantic comedy is an exercise in predictability. Hugh Grant has some funny one-liners. Like he is too old to be gyrating on stage and his hips ache. Barrymore drove me crazy with the extra whining. The song they write is has a nice melody, but the rest of the pop material would never make it.",3,1,6,30 May 2007
