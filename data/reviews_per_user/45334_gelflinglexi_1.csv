The King's Speech," So moving!
","I enjoyed the movie more than i had expected. I was completely struck by the opening scene were he struggles to stay his speech. I to have struggled with stuttering in my life and have in ways overcome and developed strategies to cope with it. I felt his fear, anxiety, huge frustration and pain so deeply. I found it so sad how it could have been prevented if not for the terrible events during his childhood. But all the methods that the final 'doctor' used were ground breaking for his time and his patience amazing. I know that this might have impacted me more than others due to my personal connection to his speech problem but i highly recommend it, even if to understand what someone with this problem goes through.",10,0,0,18 May 2011
