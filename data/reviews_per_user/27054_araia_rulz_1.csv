Hereditary," I liked the movie
","I liked the movie, i really enjoy thrillers without jumpscares.
I was quite disappointed in the tone of the ending. The acting of Peter (now King Paimon) makes little sense to me. I would've expected a more victorious feel from Paimon now that he finally made it into a healthy male body. While Paimon was inhabiting Annie it behaved quite hysterical in its desire to reach Peter's body. While in Peter's body, Paimon comes across as perplexed and plain. Not what i would expect from a dark lord.Another thing that i didn't really understand was the background music. In the beginning is ominous and perpetually present even at times when it felt completely unnecessary, and after awhile i realized that it stopped. There was no more background music. I am not sure what i should make of it.
I wouldn't particularly recommend this movie, but it feels over the top to insult the people who liked it.",6,2,5,10 October 2019
