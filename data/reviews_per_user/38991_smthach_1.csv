Come and See," 13 going on...60...?
","It's a saddens me that i can openly acknowledge the disdain I have for my country. Even if they were to disregard all the negative political and economical aspects of my country, a profound social burden weighs down upon my heart. The mere title of my analysis alone has sparked this somber realization of our inevitable downfall. '13 Going On 30'. What a paradox to this movie. Awwww this poor little girl has some issues so she wishes she could be older, awwww.But what about Florya? What about the whole generation of children who lost their innocence that Florya represents? Where's THEIR birthday wish, so they can do the exact opposite and wish to be young again before any of this ever happened?! We are so pathetic. You might be thinking this paradox is induced by only but a title, but I'm sorry there are too many things wrong with my country to not be a pessimist.At any rate, this movie is the best war movie I have ever seen; which is why I gave it a 10/10. I cannot at all relate to Florya, which is also why i give Klimov a 10/10 in directing this film; for here i perch, an American on his excessive Redwood, some 60 years later, amorously indignant from a bunch of pictures juxtaposed a certain way in order to suspend my reality for 2 hours. KUDOS Klimov, kudos.",10,2,2,14 December 2010
