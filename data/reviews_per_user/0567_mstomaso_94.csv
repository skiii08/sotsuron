The Rock," Adrenalized..... yikes
","The Rock is one of my all-time favorite suspense - thrillers. Believability - almost always a problem for this sort of film - is enhanced by a very compelling script, sets, and powerful performances by masters Sean Connery and Ed Harris. Like a good work of fiction, it's the quality of the telling that makes it believable, not the likelihood that it might happen. There are no problems with the way this story is told. The acting, editing, directing and visuals do not slip at all. Nick Cage - in a performance which approaches his best work - adds a bit of campiness and humor to this explosive mixture, and John Spencer, Tony Todd, David Morse, and Michael Biehn all contribute substantially to an exciting, fast-paced and emotionally draining film. Any avid movie-goer will be hard pressed to find a single actor in this sizable cast who has not either become a major star or a fine character actor over the last nine years.The plot takes a number of twists and turns along the road, so to discuss almost any aspect of it in detail would require at least mild spoilers. None of the plot twists are unbelievable if you are willing to accept the basic premise. The story begins with Ed Harris - a Viet Nam war hero and field leader who is now a general and has become fed up with the abandonment of covert forces operatives by the US government. To get what he wants, he recruits some of the best officers under his command to take control of and hold Alcatraz Island, holding 70-some-odd civilians hostage and aiming four missiles loaded with deadly Sarin gas directly at the heart of San Francisco.Biehn heads an elite Navy SEAL team assigned to infiltrate and disable Harris' capabilities. Cage joins him as the FBI biochemical specialist assigned the task of disarming the warheads, and the only man who can get them in to do their respective jobs is an aging British intelligence agent who has been incarcerated for 30 years or so by the government that now needs his help. Connery's John Mason escaped from Alcatraz during his incarceration, and for all intents and purpose - is a much rougher, more real James Bond character without the gadgets and the comic-book super-villains. All of the above is established in the first ten minutes of the film and the next two hours is a wild ride, with some very tense moments and some very intense performances.I'm sure a lot of people will pick this film apart for the occasional unbelievable scene, etc, but it's worth while to remember - as my spouse is always telling me - 'its only a movie'.If you want reality, take a walk outside or go to work! There are no discernible powerful political messages in this film. While it must be acknowledged that the USA does sometimes treat members of its armed forces in an unappreciative and cavalier manner, this film does not really drive this point home in the way that, for example, Saving Private Ryan did. While it is also true that the US government does occasionally cover-up its own illegal activities, or soft-pedal them with propagandistic white lies, these issues are not really the subject of this film. This is made abundantly clear by the oddly out-of-place references to Roswell, New Mexico. The writers either did not want to dignify any perceived political messages by bringing up real-world transgressions and cover-ups - many of which are far more sinister than the secret development of stealth planes. This film is pure entertainment and - at that - a work of art. Treat it as such and you might just have a good time with it.",8,73,89,27 March 2005
Walk the Line," Hard to avoid the comparison with Ray
","Walk the Line is a good film, presenting some of the highlights of the life of the great Johnny Cash and the love of his life June Carter Cash. Reese Witherspoon is INCREDIBLE, and Joaquin Phoenix is as good as he usually is in this well made biopic. For me, the music was a real highlight of the film, and the distracting similarities between the life of Mr Cash (or at least the aspects of it chosen for display in this film) and that of Ray Charles sort of took away from the overall plot.Ray made me a Ray Charles fan, though I had been familiar with Mr. Charles music for about 35 years, until the film, I didn't appreciate him properly. I have been a Johnny Cash fan for about 25 years, but from my perspective, Walk the Line was simply not as powerfully done as Ray.The Parallels between the two men's lives are bizarre, and though I know it really isn't fair to compare two whole lifetimes, I can't help thinking that some of the choices made in the selection of lifetime thresholds for WTL may have been influenced by what worked in Ray.Mangold's direction creates a very polished though somewhat Hollywood film, and the editing, script and pace of the film are all very strong.Nevertheless, this is a solidly entertaining and well made film, worth seeing for Witherspoon's amazing and lovable performance and the music alone. I also very much enjoyed Joaquin's excellent imitation of Cash's stage presence and facial expressions, but felt that his vocal impressions were just a tad over-rated.",7,7,12,18 April 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat (the film and the character) reaches for a star and comes up short.
","Sasha Baren Cohen is making a career out of humor which makes most intelligent and sensitive people somewhat uncomfortable. This is not necessarily a bad thing if the humor has a good purpose. However, the whole business has achieved, with this movie, the status of an inside-joke. If you haven't seen the Ali G show, you won't get some of this film, and it may come off simply as a painful and offensive exploitation film (which it is, to an extent). The commercial success of Borat is best explained by the market sector it appealed to - fans of Sasha Cohen and the crowd who appreciates the new wave of dumbed-down low-brow humor. Put together, that's a pretty big market.The recent trend of dumbed-down comedy (Anything starring Will Farrell, etc) is only slightly improved by Borat. The film is cleverly plotted and exploits every opportunity to poke fun at stereotypes (both American and Eastern European), but, unlike many successful attacks on stereotypes, Borat does not offer any solution nor a clear statement against them. Instead, the abject stupidity of the lead character (which is vaguely disguised as cross-cultural confusion) is used as an excuse to create a variety of absurd situations which, though sometimes amusing, are so firmly anchored in stereotypes themselves that the film's critique of stereotypes ends up doing the exact same thing as the lead character - trying very hard to do something good, but doing the exact opposite instead.Borat (Sasha Cohen) is a native of Kazakhstan (which is a real place - 9th largest country in the world - landlocked and nestled between Asia and Europe). He comes to America with a morbidly obese TV producer to create an ethnographic documentary for native county. The geography of Kazakhstan appears to be the excuse for incorporating many stereotypes about eastern Europeans and Middle-easterners. But the film has absolutely nothing to do with Kazakhstan - which is, in fact, one of the most economically self-sufficient, politically sophisticated and progressive of the former soviet republics, and has a long and interesting cultural history completely unrelated to ANYTHING shown in this film. So much for that grain of truth.Borat makes a series of amusing errors as he travels across the USA encountering every major American stereotype along the way. Borat and his producer are completely unprepared for most of what they find in America. They do not understand what toilets are, think they can rape any woman they see, and believe that Jewish people are shape-shifting, murderous thieving monsters. Borat believes that Pamela Anderson will marry him when he reaches California. I think you can see where this is headed. As many have stated before me, the film really is like a series of strung-together Jackass skits. To this simple formula, however, is added a pseudo-ethnographic component - making it just a little more edgy than the juvenile antics of the Jackass team.It's hard for me to write a bottom line recommendation for this film. The film does have some genuinely funny moments, and does sometimes make its audience think positively about cultural difference. But it's inconsistent in terms of humor, philosophy and a great deal more.If you like Cohen, you'll love it. If you liked Anchorman and Talladega Nights you might like it. If you enjoy Jackass, you might like it.Anthropologists, Sociologists, historians, people who did not vote for George Bush, middle easterners and eastern Europeans will probably want to avoid this film. Also, those easily offended by purely comedic antisemitism, stereotypes about the people of the American south, homophobia and racism, should avoid this.",5,8,12,6 May 2007
3:10 to Yuma," Thoroughly Enjoyable Remake of a Classic Western
","Long ago, I saw the original 3:10 to Yuma featuring Van Heflin and Glen Ford, but I don't remember it well enough to compare it with James Mangold's new remake. Instead, my review will focus exclusively on the new film.Mangold's film is a tense, traditional western based on an Elmore Leonard story. Leonard is a solid writer, and gave the material upon which the film is based enough background and characterization to permit willful suspension of disbelief. Mangold's film does the same. Our protagonist and antagonist are, respectively, Dan Evans (Bale) and Ben Wade (Crowe). Evans is a would-be rancher and family-man whose family is suffering from a drought and a merciless landlord. Evans and his boys cross paths with notorious outlaw Ben Wade and his gang on their way into town to confront their landlord, and Wade whimsically lets them go. But the connection between these two men and Dan's eldest son is far from over. Eventually Dan will accept an offer made by a railroad agent to help escort Wade to a train headed to Yuma prison, while Wade's crew of murderers dogs their every step.Two performances stood out for me - Bale and Ben Foster (Charlie Prince). Crowe was good, but it's not clear that he engaged with his role with his usual intensity. There are several very talented actors in supporting roles, and they each pull off the transition to the western genre quite nicely (Alan Tudyk, Logan Lerman, Gretchen Mol, Peter Fonda and others). The film showcases the acting talent very well without losing sight of its straightforward but interesting story.More often than not, good westerns are at least as much character studies as they are 'shoot-em-ups'. After all, it pretty close to impossible to enjoy a film in which anybody might drop dead at any given time without caring about the people you are watching die, or those doing the killing. Mangold achieves this by drawing on the simple strengths of the original material and allowing relationships to dominate both the story's development and the cinematography. For a western, there is a tremendous amount of dialog in this film, coupled with the usual meaningful stares. Wade is so wily and unpredictable that you really never know what to expect out of him, and his crew is headed up by his loyal and equally nihilistic protégé Charlie Prince. Dan Evans is his polar opposite, and Dan's son is an unusually accurate and complex Hollywood portrayal of a teenager. These and other relationships are the strengths and the medium of the film. When the camera isn't being used to build tension before a battle or showing us a gun-fight, it is establishing relationships and character. And many of the characters and relationships we see are surprising, ambiguous and more than a little ironic.Highly recommended for western fans.",8,122,200,11 September 2007
Ali," Meet the man behind the gloves and the poetry
","Muhammad Ali is a heroic character with legendary wit, humanity, and boxing skill. Always a fighter and always a lover, Ali's life is a subtle and clever story of dignity, strength, and compassion. And Ali himself wrote that story. This film profoundly reminds me of an autobiography Ali wrote several years ago with the help of a friend. Never afraid to do what needed to be done to get where he wanted to go, Ali was never a stranger to controversy, flambuoyance, acid wit, and an outspoken promotion of truth - even when most of his own fans couldn't see it. This film captures the champ's many battles, not the least of which are the internal battles he wages with himself over politics, his ego, money and his own destructive patterns in relationships with women. But thankfully, it does so in a respectful way which does not compromise the man's heroism, nor does it spare the audience of the laughter, mischief and joy Ali became so well known for. Michael Mann's film has relatively little boxing in it, and is in no way a chronicle of Ali's career. A better choice for that subject is 'The Greatest' - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076111/combined starring Ali himself, or one of the many documentaries on Ali. This film is about how and why Ali is who he is, and how he drove himself and everybody around him to reach phenomenal heights. It features the beginnings of Ali's career and follows him through the most difficult part of his career, when he fought the US government over the Viet Nam war, fought his own religious establishment over his outspokenness, and even fought against hypocritical promoters he relied on who were bent on exploiting the third world. Too intelligent to just be a prize fighter, too passionate to just shut up, and too faithful to give up his religion when it gave up on him, Ali just kept on driving. The film ends after Ali's fight against George Foreman in 1977, so it does not cover his entire career, and does not discuss his more recent activities. His life since retiring from boxing is equally interesting, in my opinion, but since Mann wanted to depict the most dramatic and challenging aspects of the Ali legend, I can't blame him for his choice of time frame.The cast is very strong. Will Smith gives a fine performance wonderfully recasting Ali's wonderful facial expressions, gestures, physical style and speech pattern, Jamie Foxx, Ron Silver and Mario Van Peebles are all excellent in their supporting roles. And the boxers are all very believable. They even look like the people they play. Smith doesn't really look anything like Ali, and you are occasionally aware (mainly through Smith's imitation of the greatest's very unique speech) that you are watching an imitation, but this does not in any way detract from the film.Highly recommended for those interested in real-life drama and heroism, the civil rights movement in the 1960s and 1970s, and the intelligent and political side of American sports. NOT recommended for fans of boxing movies and action films. This is a slow moving, intense drama and neither a feel-good film nor a slug-fest.",9,36,49,18 July 2005
Iron Man 3," Pulp for Genre Purists
","Iron Man 3 is more of a moving comic than a motion picture. Even the cinematography is reminiscent of old-time comic book panels. The story is light years from any reality we participate in. Like the best comics, it alludes to various aspects of history and reality cleverly but without yielding to the oppression of the everyday. Iron Man 3 is not entirely consistent with the rest of the franchise, however. Iron Man's various armor configurations appear to be a lot less resilient and functional than in the previous films (a bit like the difference between the creature in Alien and those of Aliens). Tony Stark is experiencing a great deal of apparently justifiable paranoia. He is also suffering from crippling anxiety attacks and nightmares. At one point, he is diagnosed by the most likable, heroic, and memorable character in the film - pre-teen Harley Keener (played by Ty Simpkins) - as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Stark is facing a shadowy, almost invisible, enemy, who is apparently hidden in plain sight. Having lost what would appear to be a decisive battle, Stark must rely on his wits, his own unreliable technology, and a series of unlikely heroes - a young boy (Simpkins), the alcoholic mother of a dead soldier, a media operator with a good internet connection - to prevail. Of course, Pepper (Paltrow), his AI Jarvis (Paul Bettany) and War Machine/Iron Patriot/Colonel Rhodes (Don Cheadle) also come in handy. The plot is extremely predictable, but it moves along and successfully relies on escapism, awe-inspiring effects, and entertainment value. With their respective talents, Paltrow, Downey and Pearce didn't even need to try. Paltrow and Pearce do, however, and really make the film worth watching. Downey never seems as fully engaged with this script as he has in previous comic book films. All the same, Iron Man 3 is a lot of fun and will appeal to those in search of the insane action, dysfunctional myopia of the main character and the tongue-in-cheek, slightly smarter-than-average dialog that characterize this franchise.",7,3,7,13 February 2014
Underworld," Expect Nothing, get a little more
","I enjoyed Underworld. I expected it to be absurd, awful, plot-less and pointless. While it is certainly not the most brilliant and original story, nor does it teem with insight about the human condition, its not awful, its plot heavy, and it really isn't pointless. It's just a tad absurd, though.This is the story of a human (Scott Speedman) entangled in a six hundred year old war between vampires and werewolves, and the vampire death dealer (Beckinsale) whose compassion for him permits her to seek the truth in ways that few of her species have before.The acting is of variable quality. Kate Beckinsale is wonderfully cute, and does a pretty fair job of acting when she's not doing a Keanu Reeves/Neo impression. Michael Sheen provides a great supporting performance. Shane Brolly isn't really up to the task, in my opinion.The script is good, although it's full of clichés. The editing and directing are both impeccable, and help to move everything along at an entertaining and brisk pace.This is a fun action-oriented film, with stylish darkness and enough originality to make it worth seeing. Mildly recommended for vampire and werewolf fans.",6,40,69,3 January 2006
Amistad," Whoever tells the best story wins
","Amistad is a very well crafted, well acted, and well told story. It is also mostly true to the history of events surrounding the Amistad 'mutiny', and the defense of the Africans responsible for it by John Quincy Adams and a young lawyer named Baldwin. I put the word mutiny in quotes because it is absurd to think of people fighting against murder, enslavement and rape as any form of crime. The film is unabashed about showing us the brutality and outrageousness of the covertly institutionalized slave trade that haunted one of America's darkest, most retrograde periods, and pulls no punches about the cultural differences between its victims, its culprits, and those who felt that it was not their problem.Amistad ranks as one of McConaughey's finest performances, perhaps his best. But nearly the entire cast is blown off the screen by the passionate, sensitive and profound performance of Djimon Hounsou. Hopkins is good as Adams, but what else is new? Though the film does not have a literary feel - it is pure cinema - it is a truly great story featuring bold characters and a deep and simple emotionality which draws its audience in. Alistad has a spirit that can only be described as truthfulness. Despite his detractors, Spielburg proves again and again that morally decent films with positive messages can be entertaining and artfully crafted.Highly recommended.",8,61,68,4 May 2006
Shaun of the Dead," Fairly Funny Romantic Britcom with Zombies
","Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright's Shaun of the Dead hybridizes Dawn of the Dead and 28 Days After, then infuses them into a British romantic comedy. This improbable combination of elements is nicely blended due to a solid script and very good directing.Just as pathological loser Shaun is dumped by his beloved girlfriend, an outbreak of zombification occurs in London. Inspired to show his true colors, grow up, and take the bull by its horns all at once, Shaun and his shut-in room-mate Ed develop a plan to rescue Shaun's mum, step-dad, girlfriend and his best friends by locking down in the pub which inspired the break up.Most of the laughs result from gender stereotypes epitomized by Shaun and Ed and typical horror-comedy stuff. Though this is a relatively low-brow comedy, the characters are sympathetic and real enough to carry the story. Directing and cinematography are A+ and, like the script, very British.Highly recommended for horror-comedy fans. Recommended for comedy fans. Weakly recommended for horror fans. for everybody else - this is a good movie night film for a relaxing evening with friends, booze and popcorn.",6,0,3,3 June 2008
Troy," Could have been great
","Troy was well paced, well edited, well written, well directed and for the most part, well acted. What went wrong? The soundtrack and Brad Pitt.Mr. Pitt does not act, but rather poses his way through this lengthy adaptation of The Iliad, like some cross between a rock star and the vainglorious Achilles. Is this posing,superficiality and transparency supposed to symbolize Achilles' vanity and egotism? How then, do we explain his interest in Perseus, and his ability to inspire warriors in battle more profoundly than the greatest Greek kings? Pitt indulges a grand total of two facial expressions - disinterest and mild annoyance - throughout the entire recounting of Homer's epic detailing the Trojan war. The rest of the actors are quite excellent, making Pitt's flashy performance stand-out like a sore thumb.Although this is probably a personal peeve, the soundtrack for this film really aggravated me. The score consisted of pseudo-classical meanderings-about a redundant theme - with tempos all too perfectly suited for the various battle scenes etc. My guess is that the music was supposed to heighten the excitement of these scenes. Unfortunately, for me, it only distracted me from them.All considered, I enjoyed Troy. I think it could have been a much much better film, however, had Brad Pitt been encouraged to use more of his talent and less of his abs and pecs. The film easily would have achieved a rating of 8 or 9 from me had Achilles role been more competently handled - even with the tedious soundtrack.",6,16,31,14 March 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Beautiful love story and period-piece
","Best film of 2005Brokeback Mountain is the story of two western young men who fall in love, what they are allowed to do about it by the time and place in which they reside, and what they do end up doing about it. It is also a story of developing the courage to be the person you want to be, regardless of the costs. The film walks the line between touching and gut-wrenching in its emotional impact, and should probably only be seen in an emotionally strong frame of mind.Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal give the best performances I have seen either of them give, playing two guys whose love for each other defies society, and at least early on, their own self-concepts as well. The two men choose to lead double-lives rather than giving up what they have found together. Yet their secrets threaten everything.The film is less dialog-based than the usual contemporary character study. Some of the most memorable scenes have very little chat. This method allows the viewer to allow his or her imagination to enter the story, giving a sense of participation and collaborative plot development rarely achieved in today's cinema.Ang Lee has put together a great film which could have wide appeal. It is disturbing to me that this film had such a limited early release in the United States. Have we really become so socially retrograde that the homo-phobia of a loud-mouthed minority of reactionary fanatics is easier for us to take than an unconventional love story? I hope not.",10,22,25,8 January 2006
The Day After Tomorrow," Not very good
","Where do I start? I could write several pages of continuity errors, insanities, stupidities, inaccuracies and basic logic failures, but a review should never strive to be as boring as its subject matter. Let's cut to the chase. I can not recommend this film. If you've read any of my reviews of poor films, you may remember that I reserve the rating of 1 for big-ticket Hollywood films that do more harm than good. Although I have fairly rated DAT with a 3, I should mention that it very nearly got a 1.Why can't I recommend this? 1. Great deal of scientific misinformation. (I teach geology at a university, I am not making this up) 2.Lacklustre screenplay showcasing special effects and a poorly developed family drama motif.3. Not very interesting characters. Nothing wrong with the performances. Quaid is particularly good, but Jake G is terribly miscast. Characters are clichés - Quaid is a martyr good guy scientist/overworked dad who is on the verge of losing his family. Gylenhaal is a gifted lovesick nerd who outsmarts his teachers. Sela Ward is the not-very understanding but well intentioned mom. Ken Welsh is an idiotic conservative politician who doesn't seem to be able to distinguish science from political debate.4. Absurd general premise (one day special delivery Heisenburg event) coupled with cliché characters (above) and under-developed emotional reactions.You don't even need to see the trailers to know what to expect from this movie. Quaid plays a scientist who is desperately trying to get the USA's political machine to understand global warming one week, and a father trying to rescue his son and a handful of survivors from a megastorm which is ushering in the destruction of the developed world in the Northern Hemisphere in the next week. Though Quaid is convincing, the rest of the cast joins the special effects in failing to make this believable. Not their fault. Nothing could be done! I am a sci fi fan and have no objection to fantasy. What I have problems with is science fantasy that pretends its something else. People are already terribly under-educated with the real practical and globally important issues that science contends with. We don't need Hollywood confusing matters even more. Blaming this mess on Roland Emmerich seems a bit over-simplified. He does some interesting stuff with cinematography and story telling (The Patriot), even in this film. I am not really sure where this film derailed for me. But with the elements discussed above, it's hard to imagine it doing otherwise.The film sports some pretty interesting special effects. If you're seeing it to watch New York get partially glaciated and to watch Dennis Quaid give a passable performance, then you have an excuse. Enjoy!",3,8,17,6 September 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Entertaining, but that's all
","Great cast, vast scope, decent writing and plot, excellent effects, fair directing - mediocre movie.Johnny Depp drunkenly and flamboyantly swaggers through yet another piratical farce as Jack Sparrow, the apparently dead captain of The Black Pearl. Another dead captain (Barbossa - Geoffrey Rush), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Sao Feng (Chow Yun Fat) and the lovely Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), team up to extract Jack from Davey Jones' (Bill Nighy) Locker - a desert island where dead pirates end up. Why? Well, it's actually sort of unclear, but it seems that they want to end Jones' scourge and gain their freedom from the British fleet's persecution once and for all... or something. And oh ya, they bring along the goddess Calypso, bound ages ago into a human form by pirates, just in case she wants to help her persecutors fight against her former lover Jones.Rush is great, Depp is amusing and the rest of the cast does well. The sea battles and visual effects are particularly good. But the film's meandering plot, and over-emphasis on frenetic visual activity detracts from its aesthetics and renders it merely entertaining in a very Disney way. Epic, repetitively paced and hyperactive, World's End is the least interesting of the Pirates of the Caribbean Series.",5,0,1,22 April 2008
Spider-Man 3," Fans! - Don't let your expectations run away with you! Sit back and enjoy!
","Venom, Green Goblin 3 and Sandman.Spiderman 3 reworks these three epic story arcs into a single feature length film. Impossible? Well... some of the reviewers here on IMDb seem to agree. I, however, do not. I went into this film with some trepidation and reasonable expectations. The Venom saga has been, since it first appeared in print, one of my all-time favorite multiple issue story arcs in comics. How this story could be made into a film following in the somewhat less weighty footsteps of Spiderman and Spiderman 2 was hard to imagine. The film did justice to the story-line - keeping almost all of its dark thematic content, while modifying its plot points and reducing its heavy depressive tone in order to keep the film entertaining and fast-paced. But don't expect this to be the same lengthy exploration that the comics provide.Sam and Ivan Raimi can add this to their long list of satisfying films.Briefly, Spiderman is having his normal share of growing pains. His love for MJ is now matched by his self-absorption and his addiction to heroism. Of course Harry still wants to kill him to avenge his father's death, and somewhere out there is his uncle's killer - who is about to become The Sandman. Just as things really start to fall apart, his costume turns black and develops a sinister aspect. He becomes more powerful, more ruthless, and a more conflicted being than the hero he had been. And Peter even dons black eye liner and a decidedly emo haircut. Unlike most recent comic book adaptations on the big screen, the story (to this point) offers plenty of room for humor, which Raimi could never pass up. J. J. Jameson and Bruce Campbell's excellent cameo are pure comedic relief from the somewhat heavy subject matter that seems immanent throughout this film. You'll laugh... you'll cry... You'll fall in love, if you can handle a new take on the classic Venom tale, with some worthwhile additions.Things go from bad but kind of funny to worse and pretty serious. The film explores emotions more than any superhero film I have thus far seen - with the possible exception of the original Punisher. It nicely studies Spidey's humanity, ego, fallibility, and his previously unexplored dark side, and forces our hero to confront all three both symbolically and physically in order to redeem himself.Tobey Maguire turns in his best Spidey performance yet, and is excellently supported by Kirsten Dunst and Rosemary Harris. James Franco turns in a great interpretation of Harry - much needed for this story-line. This cinematography is more wide-open and hyperbolic than the previous Raimi Spiderman films - as one would expect given the storyline. It is not surprising that the film went a little beyond the pale in terms of special effects - again unavoidable given the subject matter. But the CGI did become a little distracting towards the end.I have read a lot of disappointed reviews of this film, but honestly, I found much to praise and very little to complain about. Highly recommended especially for Venom fans.",7,185,309,13 May 2007
Match Point," Clever, polished, stunner with a lot to say about morality and fidelity
","Match Point just joined Brokeback Mountain and Cinderella Man in the top three films for me this year. Like Brokeback Mountain, however, it is almost impossible to write a reasonably intelligent review without writing a spoiler.I have been a hot and cold Woody Allen watcher, but was only a fan during his comedic phase. So, despite hearing from a few reliable sources that this is Woody's masterpiece, I was skeptical and went in with few expectations. I am glad. Approaching the movie this way allowed it to creep up on me. The NYC Jewish dialog is gone. The quirky sense of humor is nowhere to be found. the hypersensitivity is missing. Where's Woody? Well, he's in London, but the place and time, despite the opinions of some critics, are largely irrelevant in this film.There is only one line in this film that indicates its origin - it has something to do with 'intertwined neuroses' and nearly made me laugh. The first 3/4ths of this film is almost completely taken up with character development, but also contains all of the basics of the inexorable plot that truly unfolds near the end. The characters are all quite likable, and, if you're like me, you will yearn for a happy ending. Watch out! - you've just been hooked and Woody's about to reel you in! Match Point draws its audience in quietly and slowly at first, defining its territory as a smart, hip, and sophisticated character study early on (in no way unexpected for Mr. Allen), but then it takes an irreversibly sinister turn as one man threatens to bring everybody we have grown to love and respect down with him. The performances and cinematography in this film are all-around the best I've seen this year. Allen uses a lot of very close-in face shots, and his cast handles it with ease, performing their parts with accuracy and no lack of passion. Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Emily Mortimer, and Scarlett Johanssen are all excellent, and the rest of the cast lends excellent support. I found no fault in the pace or the plot - this is easily Woody's most plot-heavy film, and you can tell that he had a great time putting it together. The story line of Match Point is powerful, disturbing, and exceedingly clever. Philosophical folks will likely want to talk about it afterward. Some will find it frustrating and others will find it pretentious. Still others will point to Woody's own life and claim that this film is some form of perverse confession. Well, from my perspective, it is simply damn good story-telling.Highly recommended for adult audiences.",9,391,522,8 January 2006
Hotel Rwanda," Important
","Hotel Rwanda is an important film. It tells the true story (some fictionalization here, but not much) of Hutu hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) who, during the genocidal events of 1994, shelters both Tutsi and Hutu refugees, including his family, in his hotel and defends them by bribing the reluctant military and pleading with an ineffective, hamstrung U.N. force.While the film does not strive for shock value, nor does it over-dramatize the events of 1994, the stark reality of the story is, indeed, shocking. And the abject desperation of Paul and the over 1,200 refugees he helps is movingly and powerfully presented. The film's tone is appropriately serious, and the cinematography and directing are very straightforward - giving it an almost documentary feeling. Yet the pacing, acting, editing and script bring out the drama enough to prevent the film from slipping into the doldrums of re-enactment.All of the acting is very good. I am not going to single out Don Cheadle. His ability and what he brings to this role is unquestionable - but what amazed me was the rest of the cast playing their roles right at his level.The film did what it was meant to do - it reached a good number of people who knew nothing about the 1994 uprisings in Rwanda. It also provided a more realistic examination of what people do in a crisis than many similarly themed films I have seen. The denial and paralytic fear portrayed in this film are tangible and true.RECOMMENDATION: I have rated the film on the basis of its entertainment value. My rating is not meant to be critical of the film, but rather to suggest that people who are not interested in a serious treatment of the subject matter are not likely to be well-entertained by this film.",8,0,0,28 August 2008
We Were Soldiers," Lives up to its reputation
","We Were Soldiers is one of the better war films I have seen. This says a lot, since there have been many memorable films in this genre recently. The production team managed to unify around its central objective and more or less perfectly execute what they had intended - to bring a particular battle to the screen in as realistic a manner as possible. The film is told from the point of view of those who wrote the book upon which it is based - definitely from an American perspective - but more importantly from the perspective of a soldier. Soldiers in this film are depicted as duty and honor bound people trying to do a job, follow through with a commitment, and to keep themselves and each other alive.The film tells the story of the first major offensive of what would later become known as the Viet Nam war. The action takes place in the Ia Drang (later referred to as The Valley of Death), and is brutal and relentless. Mel Gibson and Barry Pepper lead a fine ensemble cast - nobody slips up whatsoever. The stars - and there are many recognizable faces here - disappear into their characters such that you will forget who they are. Clearly, all of the participants in this film believed whole-heartedly in what they were doing.Unlike many films of this genre, We Were Soldiers does not obsess upon heroism, on political commentary and/or on right or wrong. Since these issues are largely irrelevant in the 'on the ground' situation of the soldier at war, the perspective is appropriate and refreshing. The film borders on grotesque with its frequent and graphic violence. But its subject is one that should never be soft-pedaled. War is violent, grotesque and excessive by its very nature. Anything short of disgust would have sold the subject short.An important point, however, is that condemning war is in no way a condemnation of the brave persons who participate in it. Participation in war sacrifices not just time, energy, and at least a part of one's life, but also a piece of an individual's humanity. Regardless of the politics and all of the rest of the armchair 'participation' many of us may indulge in, what touched me most about this film was knowing that itaccomplished its one simple and important goal - to truthfully tell the story of those who lived and died in Ia Drang without a lot of embellishment, romance, or panache. What a great and honorable purpose.",9,11,19,24 December 2006
Crash," Over-rated? Well, OK...But still good!
","Let me be blunt...Crash won best picture because the Academy did not want to give it to Brokeback Mountain. It's a good film, but not the best of 2004. And the Oscar for the script is also a bit of a stretch. The editing Oscar, however, is well-deserved.The script and the multiplicity of plots are full of exaggeration. This bothered me at first, but as the interconnected plots began to reveal themselves, I was drawn in. The cinematography and the performances of the ensemble cast are exceptionally good, but the plot - frankly - seems more like a collection of 30 minute TV detective show plots all tied together by a few threads and themes than a post-modern masterpiece. The theme is primarily racism, and it is exaggerated and overdone (in some of the plots and characters) almost to the extremes of Do The Right Thing. But Crash is no comedy, and in its tragedy, some truths about prejudice in general are revealed. The film also ties together many other themes which are less well examined. The cast of characters have a bewildering array of problems which they must sort through or yield to. A few of the performances really stand out: Don Cheadle, Michael Pena, Matt Dillon and Karina Annoyave are particularly impressive after my first viewing. The film is really a long string of vignettes which appears to take place over a fairly short period of time (one of the many rather unbelievable aspects of the plot). Each character is followed briefly for the resolution or advancement of the subplots in which they are involved and then it is on to the next. Yet the film does not quite achieve the level of post-modern semi-coherence that, for example, Magnolia, Inland Empire or Slacker did. Some of the scenes are unforgettable. Matt Dillon's epiphany as he rescues a woman from a flaming car wreck - both cinematographically and in terms of performance - is a masterpiece.I recommend this film. Although the whole film tends to be over-the-top, and the script creates characters that are neither wholly likable nor truly credible, it does a nice job of balancing its nightmare/fantasy elements with the reality of the human condition. It also brow-beats its audience a bit - and then follows up with redemptions, sacrifices, and commitments to humanity. Finally, if you enjoyed Babel, you are likely to enjoy Crash - structurally and dramatically very similar films set in very different places and with very different characters.",7,8,13,14 April 2007
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," The Ultimate Cold War Film Set in Kubrick's Disorienting Pace
","Directed by Stanley Kubrick and written by the brilliant Terry Southern, Dr. Strangelove is a landmark film in many ways. While the film is normally classified as a dark comedy, it really consists of a hell of a lot of darkness made light of.There are plenty of great films which, in one way or another examine or evolve from the context of the cold war. Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove is one of the best. A deranged paranoid General (Keenan Wynn) shuts down all communication at his base, orders his men to shoot at anything which attempts to approach the base and orders the dozens of B-52s under his command to drop nuclear bombs all over the Soviet Union. The rest of the film is mostly about how the United States' bumbling bureaucracy and megalomaniacal military attempt to 'contain the situation' while practicing the usual ass-covering.Sellers plays at least three disparate and challenging roles, and, not surprisingly, has most of the truly comedic scenes. George C. Scott and Keenan Wynn are frankly incredible as a couple of deranged generals respectively attempting to make the best of the situation and end the communist threat of fluoridated water. There are very few LOLs in this film. The humor is, in fact, somewhat uncomfortable most of the time, though it is definitely humor nonetheless. And yes, everything about this film is intentional and calculated.Stanley Kubrick used pacing in a somewhat unique way in many of his most well-known films. He sometimes created visual phrases with Shatner-like dramatic pauses attached to either end, and the result is always jarring and always disorienting - making the quotidian seem odd. Strangelove is the earliest Kubrick film I remember seeing this visual style in, but he took it to a new level in 2001 and Eyes Wide Shut. A Clockwork Orange exploits it as well. In Strangelove, he complements the alienating pacing with spectacular camera work and over-dramatic lighting. Visually superb film.Highly recommended.",10,6,11,28 March 2008
Pan's Labyrinth," Visual Poetry
","Very early in this film, I formed an interpretation which I believe to be completely correct, and borne out by the plot, details, and symbolism in the film. I will not share that interpretation here. All that I will say about it is that despite knowing where the film would end up and why, I thoroughly enjoyed the journey, and was surprised by many aspects of the film along the way.Written and directed by rising Mexican directorial star Guillermo Del Toro, Pan's Labyrinth is set in Spain during the Franco years. The story's heroine is a young girl named Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and the story is told mostly from her perspective. Ofelia lives in two worlds, the miserable abomination that Spain has become under fascist control, and a world of magic in which she has learned that she may just be a reincarnated princess who has to undergo a series of trials posed by the faun 'Pan' prior to being reunited after several hundred years with her father, the king. These two worlds come together at several points in the narrative, where Ofelia needs the magic of Pan's world to resolve problems in her other realm.Ofelia's other realm is populated by her pregnant mother, who is the only parent she has known, her reluctantly adoptive father (the father of the child her mother is to bear), who is a fascist commanding an outpost in which they reside. There are several other prominent characters including members of a resistance movement a caring housekeeper and a doctor employed by the fascists.The acting is all excellent, especially the heavy (Sergi Lopez), Ofelia, and Mercedes the housekeeper (Maribel Verdu). But the story and the exceptional fluidity with which the camera and sound tell it are the real stars here. There are no wasteful scenes in this film though, to be sure there are some painful and disturbing ones.Although I have enjoyed some of Del Toro's work previously, this is the most serious, intense, and well made film I have thus far seen from him. Everything about this perfectly coherent film works, from both an aesthetic and practical point of view. Pan's Labyrinth has reached my top 5 for 2006.Very highly recommended.",10,11,22,18 June 2007
Alien," Innovative Sci-Fi Thriller Reintroduces Realism to the Genre
","While there is a general resemblance to the classic pulp sci fi film, 'It! The Terror from Beyond Space', Alien is an expertly crafted and thoroughly original film. In my opinion, it is also vastly superior to all of its descendants, including James Cameron's action and special effects smorgasbord, Aliens.As a teenager, I was so intrigued by the premise of this movie that I was one of the few people in the United States who went out and purchased Alan Dean Foster's book 'Alien' and read it before the film was released. The book was actually very good, so I knew I was either in for a big treat or a total disappointment when I went to see Ridley Scott's Alien on opening night. Of course, there was no disappointment.Scott assembled a great cast, none of whom (at the time) had a great deal of face recognition except, perhaps, Ian Holm. He placed his characters in stasis aboard a long distance freight ship ('the Nostromo') owned and operated by a mining company. The ship is grimy, a little broken down, and a bit cramped. The habitat module is one very small portion of this enormous commercial barge.The film uses sound beautifully. Both the amazingly haunting and memorable postmodern soundtrack and excellent soundscape are flawless. The film opens with the ship's computer beginning to power on the ship's systems, and even though the scene consists of nothing but sound effects and mostly immobile hardware, it is permanently burned into my memory.The crew is awakened, and unlike most sci fi films, almost immediately begins complaining about being brought out of stasis early and bickering about how much they should be paid for what appears to be an extra duty. Soon, we learn that a communication signal has been picked up on a planet nearby and the Nostromo's shuttle must descend to the planet and investigate.All of this is established effortlessly by Scott's fantastic directing, cinematography and editing, but rather than spoiling any aspect of this brilliantly plotted and presented story, I will discontinue my plot summary here and move on to the critique.Ridley Scott has directed two of the best science fiction films of all time - Bladerunner and Alien. These two films are completely different and also radically innovative for the sci fi genre. Alien reintroduces realism the the genre. The crew is not a bunch of heroic freedom fighters or righteous warriors. Instead, they are corporate staff members and a couple of administrators - a captain (Skerrit) and first officer (Weaver) who are the company management representatives, mechanics, a science officer/ship's surgeon, a navigator, and geologists (it's a mining company). The ship itself is not a sterile faster-than-light Maserati in space, but a gritty, messy, cramped, barge. And the alien is TRULY ALIEN. 'nuff said about him.H.R. Giger's organic/cybernetic art enhances the other-worldliness of all of the scenes that take place off of the Nostromo, and of course, the design of the alien itself. An enormous contribution that should not be overlooked.It doesn't really matter which version of this film you see. They are all terrific. The director's cut adds a couple of scenes which appeared in the book, but were left out of the original release. Personally, I don't think these scenes really add much to the film, but it is a matter of personal taste, since all of the versions I have seen are 10s.Recommended for anybody who can tolerate sci-fi.",10,6,10,8 June 2007
Capote," Spellbinding performances
","This is not a biography of Truman Capote, but rather a biography of his last complete major work 'In Cold Blood.' I read this book as a teenager and thought it brilliant and disturbing. This film does a wonderful job of depicting the moral ambiguity of Capote's work, his egotism, and the life history and inner conflicts which allowed him to create this great work. All the same, the subject matter here is really not explored in the depths it deserves, and the film sometimes loses its focus in the depth and quality of its performances.Hoffman has already won a number of awards for his performance. I have no qualms about this - he's a great actor and this is a challenging and powerful role played to the hilt. However, I also want to point out the tremendous supporting cast. Catherine Keener and Clifton Collins are both deserving of recognition for their intense portrayals of Harper Lee and Perry Smith.If you're a fan of Capote, or a fan of In Cold Blood, you will enjoy this, though it isn't really going to show you anything that you were not aware of. If you are the sort who goes to movies you're not necessarily that interested in just because a great performance is involved (like me in this case), you will likely enjoy Capote.",7,3,4,25 February 2006
Glory," One of the greatest period films ever made
","This film explores one of the African American contributions to the American Civil War, through the story of the 54th Regiment, an experimental fighting force lead by white colonel Robert Shaw. loosely based on Shaw's real-life story, this film creates a powerful context for exploring racial politics, courage, dignity, hope, trust and the cause of freedom in the American late 19th century.There are not enough praises in the English language to express how I feel about this incredibly emotional and amazingly well acted film. There were also not enough academy awards, nor any other award, to give Glory the recognition it deserved. This is a story of triumphant humanity and respect from which every denizen of planet earth could take important lessons. Everybody involved with this film should be commended for helping to bring it about. The cast never mis-steps, and the cinematography, script and editing make the entire two hours of the film flood by like a river which has still not quite reached the sea.There are black heroes and white heroes in this film. There is also a study of cowardice in its many forms, colors, and ways. And there is a certain redemption, hope and love running throughout the film which makes it the classic it has become. There is no sense in describing the plot. Suffice to say, the story brings tears to my eyes every time.",10,4,6,30 July 2005
The Bourne Ultimatum," Absurd but Entertaining, Propelled by Strong Performances
","The latest high quality adrenalized action franchise is Bourne Identity - Ultimatum. Matt Damon and excellent supporting actors, combine with good writing (based on Robert Ludlum's novels), decent cinematography and directing to produce one of the better action trilogies. Ultimatum is the third installment and is just as good as the previous two. The film does not contain the amount of character development in the first two, so any prospective viewer is encouraged to watch the first two films in sequence before seeing Ultimatum.In Ultimatum (strangely inappropriate title, since no ultimatum is ever delivered) Bourne gets closer to learning his own identity while his former employers close in around him. Tipped off by a smart investigative journalist, Bourne must stay several steps ahead of the most advanced espionage organizations in the world simply to preserve his own life. He tours most of Europe searching for clues and informants, and leaving the trail of destruction we have grown to expect in his wake.The following paragraph is not intended as a criticism - the film is entire entertaining. However, I do feel compelled to point a few things out regarding the basics of the premise and the action of the film. There are quite a few aspects of this film which are more than a tad ridiculous. Action audiences must be willing to suspend disbelief for substantial periods of time to be able to watch practically anything in the genre these days, but the silliness even extends into the dramatic elements of the Bourne franchise. The plot exploits American paranoia about intelligence agencies, but almost makes these seemingly omnipresent and omniscient organizations ridiculously vulnerable. Bourne himself, though a consistently compelling character, is not simply capable of surviving any physical damage, but also seems to be able to predict the behavior of several dozen people at the same time - without the assistance of the surveillance equipment being used against him throughout the film.Damon does a fine job with the lead role. David Strathairn is GREAT!!!!! Joan Allen, Julie Stiles and Albert Finney are also very strong.The editing is excellent. The film is intensely paced, but doesn't have quite the desperate feeling as the first two. The directing and camera work are fine, but some of the simulated hand-held photography and hyper-speed fight scenes seemed a little weak.Ultimately, the entire series is highly recommended for action and thriller fans, but I don't recommend walking into this without previous experience with the franchise.",7,4,6,22 August 2007
Léon: The Professional," One of the Best Action Films Ever Made!
","Luc Besson's 'Leon' AKA 'The Professional' ranks in my top ten action films of all time, along with his 'La Femme Nikita'. The difference between Besson's films and standard action films is what Besson does with the rest of the story. His films feature intense character development and satisfying human plots. In both films, Besson's heroes are ruthless professional killers. Sympathy for Nikita develops because of her tragic struggle against her own history and psychology, while Leon's latent sense of justice, brought on by his innocent love for a 12 year old girl, makes this professional hit man truly heroic. Besson's action is over-the-top, wild and unrealistic, what makes his films so believable and so compelling is PSYCHOLOGICAL REALISM - a much more engaging aspect of film than violence will ever be. Quentin Tarantino could learn much through a close study of Besson (though I am sure he has already done this) Leon is played by Jean Reno. Reno is a charismatic, under-appreciated physical actor, and his performance is wonderful. Natalie Portman, in her early teens, gives an amazing performance as 'Mathilda' the character around whom the entire story revolves. And Gary Oldman is masterful as the despicable Stansfield. Oldman has given us so many remarkable performances over the years, that it is difficult to identify his most profound parts, but this is certainly among his most memorable.Mathilda is a troubled young girl whose family - who she is not very fond of - is about to get wiped out over a drug dispute. Leon is a professional killer who lives down the hall. When Mathilda's family is wiped out, Leon - and you get the feeling that this is the first time he has allowed himself to feel sympathy is many years - takes her in. Thus begins the love story, and the story of revenge that will drive the film's major themes and its plot. The story is beautifully filmed and exquisitely paced - you will be unable to take your eyes from the screen. The soundtrack is also excellent and wholly unobtrusive. The action scenes are memorable, affective, and tastefully subordinate to the story (take note Quentin). Directing A+ Script A+ Acting A+ Story A+ Cinematography A+ Sound/Music A+Very highly recommended.",10,13,22,24 July 2007
Watchmen," Believe the Hype
","The Watchmen, a semi-dynastic group of superheroes with all of the emotional, psychological and even philosophical problems of the rest of earth's human population, has been, essentially, washed up. In his third term as president, and on the verge of WWIII with the Soviet Union, President Richard Nixon has banned super-heroism. Some turn to alcoholism (The Comedian), roguish skulking (Rorschach) or resignation and depression (Nite Owl II) while others exploit and explore their abilities in new ways (Ozymandias and Dr. Manhattan). Yet somebody is going out of their way to hunt them down, one by one. Will the seemingly unbalanced Rorschach succeed in reuniting The Watchmen to prevent nuclear holocaust and to defend themselves against their unknown enemy, and more importantly - WHY are they being picked off one by one and by whom? Loaded with irony, strong characterization and a cleverly spun plot, The Watchmen is very much worth seeing. The performances are generally very good, though I thought that Matthew Goode's interpretation of Ozymandias was a little too predictable and stereotyped. Billy Crudup and Patrick Wilson were stand-outs for me. Malin Akerman was fine, but not really challenged by her role. The effects are appropriate and never over-bearing and the script is much better than average. Well-directed and edited and very well shot, there are only a few unnecessary scenes in this lengthy film.Unlike many comic book or graphic novel films, the pace of The Watchmen is far from frenetic. Its pace is exactly that of a noir film. Some will figure out who is pulling the strings early on, but will almost certainly be unable to discern why and how. Many more will have a hard time following the film since, like many noir adventures, its course is not really established until it is too late to stop or even impede it. Rorschach, upon whom most of the first half of the film really revolves, provides the complementary angry, ironic and fast-talking' voice-over to complete the noir atmosphere.Surprisingly, despite the nihilism which underlies so much of the noir genre and was so penetratingly palpable during the real-world cold war, the film ends up being as much about ideological conflict, duality, problems of perspective, and philosophy as it is about millennial adventure. And if you walk away questioning your own concepts of good and evil and the place of humanity in all things, you've paid attention in the open and thoughtful manner the film really demands.Highly recommended for people with good attention spans. Not recommended for others.",8,31,56,7 March 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Part One: With Help, Even the Impossible Can Be Achieved
","Peter Jackson set out to make movies which the author of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, J.R.R. Tolkien would have endorsed. All three were resounding successes, though because of the film medium they necessarily varied from Tolkien's story-line. Purists may have issues with Jackson's theatrical license, but as someone who has read Tolkien's books several times and seen the films 4-5 times each, I never felt that Jackson went too far or compromised Tolkien's story, the mythology he developed or the wonderful characters he brought to life. Many have said what Jackson did could not be done. He has not only proved the nay-sayers wrong, but lovingly crafted a set of films which will, for many decades to come, stand out as a great achievement. This is the first of three reviews I am publishing on IMDb for these films. I am labeling them Parts 1, 2, and 3 just in case anybody wants to read them in order. The reviews will be self-contained, but will also be enhanced by a chronological reading. My reviews will focus on the extended edition DVDs, though my comments are also relevant to the theatrical releases.The Fellowship of the Ring introduces the key characters and the broad story arc of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Wizard Gandalf the Grey travels to a small town for small people (Hobbits)to help celebrate Bilbo Baggins' birthday. The very elderly Baggins doesn't look a day over 45, and soon it becomes apparent why. Since the great adventure of his life, a quest he was sent on by Gandalf himself, he has possessed the most powerful object in all of Middle Earth  The One Ring. This ring is evil incarnate, with an insatiable lust for power, it taints every creature who possesses it and tries to work its way back to its creator  Dark Lord Sauron. Bilbo uses the ring to disappear, as he intends to spend his senescence with his friends the Elves in Rivendell. But activating the ring, he draws the attention of Lord Sauron from thousands of miles away in the land of Mordor. Realizing what has occurred, Gandalf scrambles to determine a course of action and recruits Bilbo's nephew Frodo and his loyal gardener Samwise to bear the ring to the Council of Elrond in Rivendell. Thusly, the seeds of the fellowship are planted in the soil of the Shire.At this point, we are about 1/6th of the way through The Fellowship. Fairly soon thereafter, it becomes clear who will compose the fellowship, and who and what these people are. Though the succeeding films are not entitled 'Fellowship', they follow the adventures of the surviving central characters. Characterization is done just as Tolkien did it in the original novel  by example not discourse. For example, we are given hints to the identity of Strider (Mortenson) earlier on in the movie than in the novel, but the actual significance of this remains ambiguous until about midway through. Strong characterization is key to the success of the entire trilogy. To summarize, Peter Jackson, his team and cast  NAIL the characterization. The casting and acting is perfect. It is very difficult to resist the temptation to single out Mortenson and McKellen for carrying their difficult roles so well (Strider/Aragorn and Gandalf), but why risk diminishing the contributions of the rest of the cast? Nobody mis-steps, and it is clear from the beginning that the entire cast was thoroughly and completed engaged with the task before them.Tolkien believed that no film would ever do his work justice, and until this trilogy, he was correct.Peter Jackson and his team have managed to do exactly what they set out to. As Jackson himself has said in reference to the film trilogy, they set out to 'make Tolkien's film.' Jackson successfully drew out elements of all three books, expanding and contracting, rearranging, and sometimes adding whole subplots which are hinted at in the books, but not well explained, in order to adopt the grand story to the film medium. Arwen (Liv Tyler), daughter of Elrond and Elven lover of Aragorn, for example, is introduced early in the films and plays a role in the films which is much more equal to her significance than it was in the books.The Howard Shore score is lovely, and its simple themes are used to great effect throughout all three movies. The musical collaborations improvising on Shore's basic themes are great, and, though they feature some prominent performers  are never weighed down by star-power.Jackson made all three movies simultaneously. This technique allowed for perfect continuity, and permitted much greater flexibility in editing and post-production work than would normally be allowed. Knowing that he would need to establish and support his own fellowship to make this production work, he also knew that success would make the production legendary. So, he documented the creation of the films beautifully. Two complete DVDs full of documentary pieces are included in all three Special Edition Packages in the trilogy. Many are likely to be bored by the details in these documentaries, but those interested in the creative process behind the films will be provided with a more comprehensive view than I can remember ever seeing in any similar DVD package. The Fellowship of the Rings is as true a representation of Tolkien's novel as can be imagined. Although some aspects of the stories in the novel were adapted to the screen, the essentials, the characters, and the overall story are not just recognizable, but ENHANCED by the film. What results is a film that is not just entertaining, but an enormous fulfillment of an undying wish of millions of fans around the world.Very highly recommended.",10,34,40,30 November 2007
Pitch Black," Relentless and gorgeous sci-fi action film
","Let me waste a moment of your time to explain how I approached this film. 1st I dismissed the trailers out of hand because the film appeared to be an uncredited remake of Aliens, which I consider to be one of the weakest films in the Alien series. Stupidly continuing to dismiss the film after I heard positive things about it from people whose opinions I trust, I missed the theatrical run completely. I then became hooked on Farscape, in its 3rd or 4th season at the time, and found Pitch Black on cable one night around bed time - so I said 'oh why not, at least it has Claudia Black in it.' Soon, I recognized Keith David, and began to realize that Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser could all act (why this should surprise me, I do not know). I was captivated. I have now remained captivated for four years. I just watched the film for the 3rd or 4th time, and I still love it.This is not an art film, not an independent, and its not entirely original, but where it fails to break a lot of new ground, it utterly succeeds in providing interesting, realistic characters, hard-driving action in the medium of a compelling but simple plot, and non-stop entertainment; an absolutely beautiful environment with tastefully rendered special effects. Sound to good to be true? Don't take my word for it... see it for yourself.The film also highlighted the charisma of the now somewhat iconoclastic Vin Diesel, introducing the character of Richard Riddick. Diesel would go on to star in the somewhat Riddick-ulous Chronicles thereof (which I also enjoyed, though recognizing its rather huge flaws) and is now something of a legend. Diesel is so charismatic, so big, and so interesting to watch that it is easy to ignore the fact that he is not only a talented actor, but a smart one too. Checking out the DVD version of Pitch Black, with the audio comments on might just blow you away.The film is about the crew of an inter-system transport ship stranded on an unknown planet after a crash-landing in which their captain was killed. The new commander is inexperienced but bright and heroic (Mitchell), but she is caught between two dominant and dangerous personalities - a bounty hunter with secrets (Hauser) and a dangerous criminal who has been surgically altered to see in the dark (Diesel). Is that all? Of course not - the planet is inhabited, and the inhabitants are hungry.As unoriginal and improbable as some of this may be, Pitch Black is beautifully filmed, well told, and very nicely performed. Don't expect to learn anything, and don't expect to have to think a whole lot, but do expect to have fun with this modern sci-fi action classic.",8,76,102,10 September 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," Slick Remake
","Aja's the Hills Have Eyes retains the suspense, feeling and real horror of Wes Craven's original 1977 The Hills Have Eyes, and adds more modern characters and a bit of plot. Unlike many recent horror films, Hills develops its characters beyond stereotypes before subjecting them to grisly deaths and cannibalism, and develops suspense very well by allowing the plots to expand between gross-out scenes. The Hills also cuts very few corners in terms of graphic horror and disturbing violence, and the gore is refreshingly realistic, non-Tarantino, and unsanitary.A family is traveling across the Nevada desert near a former nuclear testing range when they need to get gas. The gas station attendant finds them annoying and decides to misdirect them into the testing range. A few clues are scattered about the early scenes from which the back-story of the plot can be deduced, but these are not to be fully understood until it becomes clear that the family is to be hunted down, sadistically murdered, and eaten - 1 by 1.Although the film vaguely connects to environmental issues and various fears concerning deformity, it appropriately avoids making any political and/or moral statements and exhibits the sort of nihilism needed for a truly scary film.The acting and the script are very good in comparison to the genre's norm. Dan Byrd was particularly impressive as Bobby Junior. the film is also well directed and the cinematography, pace and editing are a touch better than the original Craven film. All considered, this is one of the better horror films of the new millennium, so far - a little less innovative and intelligent than The Descent and a little less scary than 1408, but much more suspenseful than either.",7,0,1,15 February 2008
Cold Mountain," Hope in Times of Despair
","Anthony Minghela's (writer/director) Cold Mountain is a carefully constructed, sensitive, and intelligent drama set in the social context of the confederacy during the civil war. It deals with the politics of the war in a very subtle and realistic manner. While it accurately depicts the brutality and inhumanity of that war, it also does something that many films related to this period do not handle effectively - Cold Mountain studies the southern context from the inside out, and portrays changes among the non-slave owning common people wrought by the war. Almost uniquely, Cold Mountain does not over-generalize southerners, northerners or anybody else.The film surfs through genres as needed - never presenting a dull moment. It is a romance, a war story, an action-adventure and historical fiction, all nicely woven into one.The story centers on Inman (Jude Law) and Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), who are smitten with each other for very simple reasons. As this young romance begins to bud, Inman enlists in the confederate army, taking with him a book Ada has given him and a photograph of her. Ada's character is one of the most brilliant aspects of the film, which is important because the audience experiences this film from a third person perspective, but the story is clearly hers from the beginning to the end. Ada is an intelligent southern belle and daughter of a liberal minister. She begins the film as a daddy's girl skilled in many of the arts that southern women who have been surrounded by servants most of their lives were expected to learn. In other words, as she admits to Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger), she is a master of everything useless.Ada's father passes on, and she is left to manage his modest estate by herself. With no experience of this sort, she struggles, and survives by holding the memory of Inman close to her heart. Ruby enters the picture as a tough young woman who has been raised by a drunk and negligent father. Ruby has all the skills and abilities Ada lacks, and as they become inseparable business partners, they grow to love one another as best friends. Inman's experience is radically different, but something of a mirror image. During his participation in the war, he sees many friends killed for causes they don't really believe in, and decides to desert. Nobody he meets comes to his rescue as he begins the thousand mile walk back to Cold Mountain and Ada, and most of those he meets die.The bulk of the film takes place during Inman's long walk, following both of the protagonists as they live, learn, grow and change. An on-going act of will borne of desperation preserves their intense passionate love. For Inman, it is his only source of hope in a world of pure desperation. For Ada, it is very much the same thing, but also a symbol and remnant of the old south - a world which is rapidly passing.The cinematography is powerful and breathtaking. There are beautiful shots of Appalachian landscapes which give the film a strong sense of history. The script and editing are also extremely strong - emphasizing the broad class and educational differences reflected in the ante bellum southern dialects of the middle and lower classes. With the cast of this film, nothing short of perfection should be expected. And the cast, mostly, rises to the occasion. My one criticism, however, relates to the accents adopted by Kidman and Law's characters. An Australian and a Brit probably should not be expected to accurately reproduce southern American speech, but there are a few occasions where these two exceptionally gifted actors produce distracting vocal slips. I admit my oversensitivity to this, and can say with some confidence that it won't bother most people. Zellweger's performance is outstanding and she creates a character I will remember into my senescence.Very highly recommended.",9,70,85,4 October 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," You don't get better suffering than this
","Melodramatic comedy has developed a new subgenre - the dysfunctional family film. Sure, there have been precursors to The Royal Tannenbaums, the Turnblads of Hairspray, The Addams Family and the Hoovers of Little Miss Sunshine, but with the advent of the euphemism 'independant film' film-makers can now at least pretend to deal more openly, intelligently and humorously with taboo subjects that you'll never see on The Brady Bunch. Even if it now seems necessary to make a film with an 8 million dollar budget appear to be independent.Little Miss Sunshine is a really nice little film. It follows the misadventures of a family on the brink of bankruptcy, divorce, suicide, death and general angst as they journey from Albuquerque to Redondo Beach to enter their little girl, Olive (Abigail Breslin) into a beauty contest. There are several very funny moments, but the film reaches deeper levels than most comedies and thankfully avoids insulting its audience's intelligence like most contemporary comedies do.The script is exceptionally good. The directing and editing are fine and the cinematography is excellent.The ensemble cast is terrific and each character is very carefully written. Although the characters are very consistent they are anything but shallow and one-dimensional. You will probably feel as if you've met them - and this feeling is one of the keys to enjoying this film.About 28 years ago, a friend of mine said to me that 'everybody's problems are the biggest problems in the world to them.' Taken in its proper context, this simple truth has helped me understand the structure of personal tragedy - which is the philosophical core of this film - nicely summarized by Steve Carrell's character in his discussion of Marcel Proust near the end of the film. And I don't just mean that what does not kill you makes you stronger. This film packs a better, simpler, and more profound message than this cliché can express.Recommended - especially for people who sometimes forget to enjoy their lives.",7,2,4,23 January 2008
"I, Robot"," Entertaining action sci fi flick, marred by product placement and weak adaptation
","Asimov is not quite spinning in his grave, but I think he would have a difficult time recognizing his influence in this adaptation of one of his best novels. Yes, the three laws of AI are here, and yes, the basics of the plot are preserved, but that's about where the similarities end. This is an explosive action film with some simple messages about humanity and person hood which have been explored many times before and in more intelligent and challenging ways. Nevertheless, it's also a much better film than I expected it to be.I, Robot asks questions about souls and whether they are a product of human biology or intelligence, but doesn't explore them very deeply. Any depth in this film is directly attributable to Asimov's original material. Mostly, this is a murder mystery with a great deal of unnecessary mechanized violence, car chases, and high speed action. A top cyberneticist has died as a result of a fall from a glass enclosed lab, and the only witness is a robot endowed with not just human intellect, but human emotion. Will Smith is a luddite technophobic detective who quickly becomes convinced that this machine may have murdered the scientist, but why? Will Smith is decent, but the material isn't much of a challenge for him. Bridget Moynahan is good in a somewhat more difficult role. However, the star of the show is a CGI robot played by the wonderful Alan Tudyk - 'Sonny'.This is definitely a genre film. Even the casting attempts to pull in the sci fi audience - the very recognizable genre star James Cromwell (Star Trek...) Tudyk (Serenity, Firefly). The directing has its moments and the camera-work is sometimes Spielburgian in scope.Recommended for sci-fi action enthusiasts. Others will likely be bored.",6,3,4,26 October 2005
Over the Hedge," Family fun with positive messages
","I am weary of a recent trend in animated features - films which freely mix adult themes with children's entertainment. I'm also no big fan of anthropomorposed animal movies. However, this film has a great big heart, and includes positive messages from which both young and less-young alike could profit.The story is about a raccoon (whose voice is so well played by Bruce Willis that you will immediately forget whose voice you are hearing) who owes a mean-spirited bear a whole season's worth of food, and whose very life hangs in the balance. The raccoon encounters some naive critters who are about to go gathering their stores for the winter and contrives a plan to steal vast amounts of food from a local suburban development and then steal that same food away from his compatriots to pay back the bear.The hedge is a brand new phenomenon for the extended family of forest creatures among which the raccoon finds himself, and the ecological message is not lost on thoughtful viewers. The film lampoons a lot of uniquely human values and the treatment of various animals whose lands we often usurp as 'vermin'.The voice talent is particularly wonderful. Most memorable for me was Steve Carrell - who plays the huge-hearted ADHD squirrel. And the animation is a lot of fun, though not particularly innovative (as this genre has advanced so quickly over the last few years).I recommend Over the Hedge to anybody looking for a thoughtful, family-oriented and heart-warming film about love, working together, nature, and honesty.",8,4,5,3 June 2006
Being John Malkovich," Eraserhead for rationalists / Postmodern-Lite
","Being John Malkovich is an odd little dark comedy which is slightly open to interpretation, but deals with themes like identity, manipulation, sex, and neuroses. The acting is excellent - but nothing less should have been expected from this cast. The screenplay is also very good, as is the direction and editing. The film moves along at a comfortable pace, relying more on the somewhat obscure messages embedded in the intriguing plot than on characters, plot-line, action, or intellect.John Cusack plays a control freak whose obsession manifests itself in his choice of an unsuccessful career - as a puppeteer. Cameron Diaz plays his wife, a passive woman with little self-determination and a very big heart. Catherine Keener plays a shallow jet-setter Cusack, and later Diaz, becomes obsessed with. John Malkovich plays John Malkovich.... sort of.One of the challenging aspects of this film is that none of these characters, with the exception of Malkovich himself, are very likable. They all do drugs, obsess on their own fantasies and have rather warped self-concepts. Of the three principals, I chose to like Diaz' character most simply because she loved animals so much.In any case, the plot is basically a bit of post-modern twilight zone sci-fi, with a somewhat more linear and conventional story line than some of the more challenging material in post-modern cinema (i.e. Eraserhead, Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive). The success of this film is probably largely due to its inherent rationality - like Memento, it feels weird and moody, but is really based on a pretty simple, if somewhat silly, concept.By entering a tiny tunnel in an office on the 7.5th floor of an office building where Cusack and keener work, you can become John Malkovich for fifteen minutes. Unless you are a puppet-master, in which case you can possess the legendary actor for the remainder of his life. To reveal any more of the plot would require a spoiler, so I will stop here. However, I want to write a little about the general themes the film comments on.*BJM points out a relationship between puppetry and acting. Though clever and cleverly portrayed, this connection is really rather superficial and pedantic.*BJM has a queer concept of morality and control. While the question of what happens to Malkovich throughout the film is hardly asked at all, the film seems to say that overtly attempting to control others is a bad thing, while doing so passively is really quite OK.*BJM definitely has a drug-induced flavor to it. I haven't smoked dope in many years, but this film is the sort of thing I used to write while high. From the amount of pot-smoking references in the film, I also got the feeling that at least the writer considered it a major part of his life.This is a really neat little surrealism-lite film. It's far from a masterpiece, but definitely worth seeing.",8,16,37,14 March 2006
Jarhead," Very well done
","Sam Mendes has done exactly what needed to be done with Anthony Swofford's personal memoir of the first Bush gulf war - he brought it to life honestly, with minimal embellishment, and with captivating artistry. A second viewing will be required for me, and I suspect that my rating will improve after I see it again. Mendes directing, and the straightforward script, combine to make what could have been a trial by tedium, brisk and entertaining.Swoff is a fairly typical young man - naive yet not idealistic, self-centered and myopic but not really closed to the world around him, sometimes arrogant yet not really rebellious - who has enlisted to serve in the first Bush gulf war. He's not really gung-ho about anything in particular, but nevertheless, manages to experience both the war and his preparation for it as a series of disappointments, protracted fits of boredom, and an exercise in humiliation and futility. The film is presented apolitically, and politics will only interfere with your experience of the film to the extent that you let it. As somebody who supported the first Bush gulf war, though not our stated reasons for launching it, I very much appreciated the insider view this film offered.The personalities in it are so vivid (some cross the boundary into stereotypes and never come back) that the film sometimes loses focus on its subject in order to comment upon individual people within the protagonist's very narrow field of view. Given the myopic character of the work from which this is derived, and the intense subjectivity of the approach, this turns out to be a strength of the film - making it truly original for its genre. this is no 'war film' as the genre stands today, but rather, one of the first of what will likely be a postmodern redefinition of the war film genre - focusing reflexively on the practice of warfare as experienced by those who were actually there. An older, less polished, film that I particularly liked, but which seems to have been largely ignored comes to mind - 'Heroes'.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Swoff well, but for me, the supporting cast really made this film. I see this cast as an ensemble. To a man, the performances were flat-out exceptional. As with most of Mendes' work, the film is also visually stunning.Recommended, strongly.",8,6,11,24 November 2005
Dark City," We are Rats in a Maze Without an Exit
","The opening voice-over narrative by Kiefer Sutherland is worrisome. Within a few seconds of the beginning of Dark City we learn that the film' s Men-in-black have abducted a city's worth of humans (given the noir-esquire landscape and the 1940s and 1950s cars we have assume this happened in the mid-20th century) in order to perform experiments and learn what allows the human species to continue to thrive. The film is more about spirituality than evolution and more fantasy than sci-fi. But do not let the apparent spoiler in the preface or the lack of plausibility bother you. After the opening scene, you will be hooked.Rufus Sewell and Kiefer Sutherland star, supported by William Hurt and Jennifer Connelly - an impressive cast for a work of imaginative fiction. And they are all put to really good use. Sewell is a man who inexplicably has virtually no memory and is the prime suspect in a serial murder case. His estranged wife (Connelly) and two police detectives (Hurt and Colin Friels) are all looking for him, and he is looking for a truth which may or may not exist. Transcending all of this is the work of The Strangers and their apparent human puppet, psych-pharmacist Kiefer Sutherland - who put everybody (except Sewell) to sleep at noon everyday in order to rearrange the city, people's memories, and more.The cast is very good. Sewell and Sutherland's roles were very demanding and both actors interpret them interestingly and well. Connelly and Hurt provide exceptionally good support. Hurt looks like he was born for film noir.What this film ends up being about (no spoiler - you will have to see it to even interpret this comment) is what we choose to do and why. And the answers for Sewell's John Murdoch and Sutherland's Dr. Shreber may surprise you. The script is one of the best of the genre - well thought-out, intelligent and providing solid opportunities for character development.The film is very nicely and artistically designed and shot. the city's landscape is surreal-noir as are the costumes. The alien technology and costuming is dark, imposing and Gothic. The look and feel of the film, oddly, is that of a dark and creepy fairy tale, not the sci-fi adventure that the story develops into. This treatment is particularly affective, because it gives the somewhat predictable action scenes both a meaningful context and a somewhat less climactic feeling than usual.",9,2,5,3 February 2008
The Machinist," Hitchcockian psychological gut-wrencher - well done! AMBIGUOUS SPOILER
","In an era where 'feel good' films seem to be the only stuff getting any attention (maybe because the state of global politics is forcing us all into deep states of denial), it should be no surprise that this spell-binding odyssey of psychological terror slipped by with little fanfare. The Machinist is disturbing from start to finish and executed with style. The pace is a bit plodding, but the excellent performances, and the highly compelling plot pay off very well.Christian Bale gives a strong performance in a very physically and emotionally demanding role. He plays a machinist, Trevor Reznick, who has not slept for a very long time and whose dream-world is beginning to impinge on his conscious mind. In short, he is losing his grip, and some very bad things are happening because of it. Bale's appearance alone is ghastly in this film - he is so thin that the frequent scenes depicting him without a shirt are instantly depressing. The film dances on a tightrope between reality and paranoid delusion consistently. Excellent supporting work by Jennifer Jason Leigh and Michael Ironside help drive the story. Leigh plays a prostitute who has fallen for Reznick, and is offering him a future, and, possibly salvation from himself. But Reznick seems hell bent on casting aside any hope of salvation. The plot is full of secrets, cleverly woven together to compose a non-linear post-modern mosaic of images which represent events - part of a story we are not privy to until the very end of the film.My only complaints about this very well made film are minor. I felt that the soundtrack was somewhat uninspired and a little pretentious, and I felt that one of Bale's solo scenes was poorly executed (when he is leaving Ironside's house and spots Ivan's car parked at a nearby corner). How and why this film was passed up by so many awards is a puzzle almost as difficult to solve as the film's own plot.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for Hitchcock fans and those who enjoy intelligent but plot-heavy disturbing films.",8,6,9,13 July 2005
Ratatouille," The Rat in the Hat
","Ratatouille is a sweet little film about a Parisian rat with ambitions to become France's top chef, and a young dish-washer who may just be his only hope. The plot takes a number of clever twists and turns and delivers some unpredictable elements, which keep what could have been 'just another Pixar' quite fresh. Setting the film in France, and giving it just a pinch of French absurdist comedy for seasoning was a stroke of brilliance. The voice talent is also quite excellent - especially Ian Holm's 'Chef Skinner' - who also does a mean Golem impression btw - and Jeanine Garafolo's 'Collette'.I am generally not a big fan of talking animal movies, though purely animated ones are definitely preferable to those that morph real animals. But Ratatouille even does this very differently - the rats can understand our language, but we don't get theirs. And, other than their very military approach to getting things done, and the lead character's odd cooking talent, they generally behave like rats and have rat motivations.The movie is fun and funny and, at times, quite heart-warming. The rats are absolutely adorable and even do their own stunts! The human characters, though less sympathetic, are some of Pixar's best! Recommended for family viewing - kids of all ages.",9,10,16,1 July 2007
The Usual Suspects," A Perfectly Crafted Mystery - (very ambiguous spoiler)
","Kaiser Soze is a super-criminal of almost comic-book stature. Legendary among an underground of testosterone and nicotine-driven low-life 'usual suspects' of this film - Soze - remains unseen, fantastic, just outside of the camera's view, and detached from any reality we might call familiar or real. Nevertheless, he is the central character in the film, and the single force of will driving the entire film. The viewer, like the characters portrayed, must constantly ask 'Who is Kaiser Soze, does he even exist?', and - as silly as it might seem - 'is he the devil himself?'. Soze's irresistible will is represented and enforced by an emissary (the stone-faced Pete Postlethwaite) who is just as cold-hearted as any of the hardened criminals who comprise 'The Usual Suspects'.The narrative begins and almost ends as a retrospective with just a bit of very necessary voice-over narrative by Spacey. His character - Verbal Kint - is interrogated by Palmintieri concerning the murder of several hardened criminals in a single night aboard Russian ship. Most of the major plot points are highlighted wonderfully by the changes of pace and camera work afforded by the shift between one plot - the events leading to Kint's interrogation - and another - the interrogation itself.Kint, physically disabled and emotionally disturbed, is himself a desperate, down-on-his luck, petty criminal whose chief talent seems to be getting mixed up with and attaching himself to more talented criminals. His latest 'friend' - Keating (Byrne) is a brilliant but depressive thief who is trying to straighten his life out for a woman lawyer he has fallen for. But along with the other 'usual suspects' - expert safe crackers, con men and sociopaths (possibly the best performance of Stephen Baldwin's career thus far) all - Keating is swept up into agreeing to do 'one final job'. In a fine piece of character interpetation, Byrne plays denial to the hilt telling himself that this job, if successful, could end his life in crime permanently. These expert thieves, con men and killers meet in a bogus police line-up one night and from that point on, they are bound together under the control of Soze until they either succeed or fail in the crime he has laid before them.Soze has been betrayed, whether directly or indirectly, by each of these men, and he leaves them all no choice. Accept the crime plan or die. They accept, knowing that their odds of success are, to say the least, very limited.The entire feeling of this film shifts radically from the action of the main plot (described in Kint's narrative) and the narrative itself (Kint's interrogation). While this may look simply like a clever piece of film work, it is actually a very brilliant plot device, as both story lines are finally united in the stunning and brilliant finish.While I am not usually a ready fan of mysteries, and even less interested in thrillers, this film was pure entertainment from start to finish.Director Singer has established himself as a pioneer in ensemble cast direction, and this film alone (his third) should have awarded him that title.The performances are, without exception, flawless. While flawlessness or some approximation of it is something I generally expect from people like Spacey, Byrne, and Del Toro, many of the folks in this film very much surprised me. I now watch out for folks like Kevin Pollak, for example. Without detracting from the performers whatsoever, some credit for the stunning quality of the performances must go to the director, editor, script and cinematography team. This film makes them all look positively great.I was bitterly disappointed by the fact that this film did not take many Academy Awards in its release year. While I realize that the academy's choices do not always reflect quality or achievement, I prefer to maintain at least a superficial guise of hopefulness. The fact that Usual Suspects did not win for editing was the biggest shock. I can not think of a better piece of editing.",10,64,88,4 February 2005
Independence Day," Limited character development and an uncomplicated plot result in a one-shot movie
","Independence Day doesn't stand up particularly well to a second viewing. It is basically a millenial version of The War of the Worlds with grand-scale effects and a cast which probably cost almost as much as the effects. Will Smith, Randy Quaid, Jeff Goldblum, Adam Baldwin and Judd Hirsch help pick up a surprisingly talented (but underexploited) cast and seem to have enjoyed their parts. Unfortunately, the mediocre script allowed few of the other actors to make their roles shine.The plot is so simple it's hard to imagine a 140+ minute film about it. The earth is under invasion from a highly advanced and merciless alien culture hell bent on intergalactic conquest. Our most powerful weapons can not pierce their shields and their weapons are capable of incinerating cities the size of Washington DC with one shot. After the first wave of attacks, all seems lost, and humans must find some way to fight back.Roland Emmerich's direction is good. There are few dull moments and very little in the way of uninteresting and pointless scenes. Unfortunately, the characters are generally two-dimensional - even Bill Pullman's brooding, depressed President of the United States comes across as an uncomplicated, uninspired and unemotional individual. Limited character development and an uncomplicated plot result in a one-shot movie.The best performances in Independence Day are the semi-comedic ones (note the actors mentioned above. This should tell you most of what you need to know about the film. Enjoy it by not taking it seriously, but spare yourself a second viewing unless intoxicated. And, oh yea, don't see it if you have a problem with American nationalism - the film is full of it.",6,45,92,23 January 2006
Alien vs. Predator," Entertaining but meaningless and silly
","AVP is one of Paul W. S. Anderson's better efforts. Inexplicably - I saw it during its theatrical run at the request of my spouse. I agreed to see the film mainly because I enjoyed Event Horizon (probably Anderson's best effort to date). Neither of us had ever played the computer game and despite my 30+ year interest in comic books, I had never bothered with the comic book. From what I understand from the reviews gamers and comic fans have given this film - my lack of familiarity with the game and the comic probably worked in the movie's favor. Check through the reviews here on IMDb and you will see that there are a lot of fans who are violently angry about this film - so much so that they have provided negative feedback to nearly every review that speaks positively about AVP and voted for all of the negative ones. In other words, having an opinion about this film, if it is not 'the right one' can get you into trouble.Despite his mediocre to bad reputation, Anderson's films have always entertained me. Entertainment is, I believe, all Anderson attempts. His movies are generally pretty shallow, very visual, and fast-paced. Do not go to an Anderson film in order to have an emotionally charged, deeply satisfying film experience or to be exhilarated by a sweeping, revisionist interpretation of classic fictional themes. Instead, bring popcorn and minimal expectations.AVP is a silly story which could have been pulled out of the X-Files. There is a nest of Aliens buried deep below the tundra in the arctic region of Siberia and it has just reactivated for a ritual hunt by - you guessed it - a young 'predator'. The interpretation of the Alien here is that of Aliens, not the original Alien. Since I consider Aliens to have been the worst film in that series, and since I disliked the radical reinterpretation of the creature provided by that film, I could have been seriously annoyed by this, but the entire Alien series is in a different class of film from AVP, so I am not going to make an issue of this.As the nest reactivates, an American millionaire's scientific team discovers the heat signature and prepares an expedition. As they arrive, they discover that somebody has beaten them to it. An entire mining camp has been set up to explore the heat signature, but what did the miners find? And where have they gone? What follows is about an hour and ten minutes (this is a short film and no time is wasted) of wild action and effects-laden scenes. There are relatively few surprises, and very little dialog (after all what would you say to a pair of grunting, hissing and roaring killing machines fighting it out under the ground in a set which could have been borrowed from the most outlandish Indiana Jones movie?).Taken in its proper context, AVP is an OK film. It has little to do with the comic book and the video game, but it's a fun little romp nonetheless. The acting is passable. The script is minimal, and only permits character development for Henriksen and Lathan, and the direction is typically slick. The special effects are quite good, and the film is strongly visualized. Although some of the aliens scenes are almost comedically outrageous, the aliens are visualized more interestingly than in many of the recent films from the Alien series.Keep your expectations appropriately low, grab a good supply of popcorn, and enjoy. If you are looking for something powerful and artistic, don't bother with this.",5,4,7,10 October 2006
Batman Begins," Best of the Batman films so far. Deep, dark, and refreshingly serious
","I never thought Christian Bale could displace Michael Keaton as the best batman, but, sorry Michael, the deed is done.Batman fans should find no surprise in the darkness of this tale depicting the early life of Bruce Wayne, his transformation into The Batman, and one of his most harrowing adventures. I avoided reading reviews before seeing this. As a lifelong comics fan, I felt this film deserved an open mind from me. After seeing one of the trailers, I became convinced that this film was going to be based on Frank Miller's The Dark Knight, a legendary take on the 1930s Batman origin story inked in the 80s by the man who later gave us Sin City. But no, this is a fresh and original Batman film, including the significant elements of the original, but adding its own very carefully thought out embellishments. While it has all of the darkness of The Dark Knight, it has all of the plot elements of the original, and more.The familiar Batman story is told early in the film, but by the time we are allowed to focus on Wayne, he has grown into a young man. Wayne is depicted as a troubled drifter whose traumatic early life has left him seeking understanding in all of the wrong places. Bayle plays the character to the hilt - with his detachment, repressed anger and heavily depressive tendencies sustained throughout the entire film. Susceptible to any guidance that might provide him with a chance to right the wrongs he has seen, he falls under the spell of Ra's Al Ghul high in the Bhutanese Himalayas and becomes an apprentice in the League of Shadows - a secret society of ninjas who purge the world of corruption in a merciless manner. Wayne's martial arts training is where the major story arc begins.This is easily the most serious, intelligent, and adult of the batman films. It is well filmed, relentlessly fast-paced and intelligently scripted. Batman Begins also sports a phenomenal cast. I am aware that a few people felt that Katie Holmes was miscast as Rachel Dawes, but I couldn't agree less. She did a good job as, basically, the only woman in the film. The rest of the cast did not miss a beat either. The very likable Michael Caine makes a great Alfred, though I have to admit I was concerned when I first saw him on screen (having never gotten over some of his weaker efforts).With Sin City and Batman Begins coming out in the same year, it is easy to imagine that - after decades of struggle - the comic media has finally successfully broken into serious commercial films. Let's hope it's here to stay!",8,19,34,6 July 2005
X-Men: The Last Stand," Great potential somewhat squandered
","Just when it seems that the coexistence of mutants and Homo sapiens sapiens is secured and safe, a pharmaceutical company comes along with a 'cure' for the X gene. The cure is offered voluntarily at first, and several troubled mutants take 'the cure'. Of course, the government immediately weaponizes it and this feeds Magneto's predictably xenophobic reaction. And by the way, Jean Grey is back... sort of... Fans of the comic books will know what that means.X-Men III is a pastiche of some of the most profoundly emotional and well conceived stories the X-Men comics have produced over several decades. In saying this, I am actually saying that some of the stories pilfered for this film are among the best that have ever appeared in the comic medium. Unfortunately, from beginning to end, this third installment suffers from detached and nearly inept directing, a mediocre script, and inconsistent characterization. Characterization is not simply inconsistent with the characters portrayed in the X-Men comics, as several reviewers here have pointed out, but inconsistent from film to film within the trilogy. The fans have it right this time, this film should have stuck much closer to the original material. In compensation, the audience is treated to some amazing visualizations and effects. And while effects also helped to make the first two movies, X-Men III subordinates characters, feeling, and intelligence to effects and plot - a fatal mistake in the comic book film genre.Having said this, I should also note that the film is not absolutely awful, but just mediocre. It is the comparison with its excellent predecessors that forces my low rating. The major message the film should carry to would-be film makers is 'don't fix what ain't broke'. In this case X3's creative team should have stuck with the original stories and the original characters rather than half-thinking out personalities and plots and trying to force so many different stories to weave into one. Less would have been much much more in this case, and the Phoenix saga would have been more than enough for an emotionally engaging and intelligent film to cap off this trilogy. The worst aspect of The Last Stand, however, is probably the clichéd, over-dramatic and unengaging soundtrack. Kudos to Famke Janssen for an outstanding performance. Hugh Jackman also handled his somewhat difficult interpretation of Wolverine well enough. The rest of the cast did what they had to do but were not given enough script to fully realize their characters.",5,2,4,8 October 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Part Two: An Examination of Trust, Intention, and Goodness
","The Two Towers is the second book in Tolkien's masterpiece trilogy of invented English mythology and the second film in Peter Jackson's film trilogy based on the original mid-20th century novels.The Fellowship has physically disbanded, though through its bonds of purpose and friendship, remains intimately connected. Two Towers follows the members of the fellowship through their continuing, and increasingly dark and dangerous, adventures as they each do their part (whether accidental or intentionally) to try to save all that is good in Middle Earth from the power-hungry eye of Sauron, Lord of Mordor. Frodo (Wood) and Samwise (Aston) are lead by their captive Smeagol/Golem (Serkus) to Mordor, but Golem's intentions are, at best, suspicious.The ring has begun to taint Frodo's mind and soul, and rage and hate make fleeting and uncharacteristic appearances in this previously innocent and light-hearted Hobbit. He has already begun to recognize that he and Golem have more in common than anybody would care to admit. His profound friendship with Sam is very nicely portrayed in this film and is as central in the film as it is in Tolkien's original work. Smeagol/Golem is also treated sympathetically and his ambiguity and the polarity of his personalities are key to his role as an unpredictable element.The story also introduces three major human characters- Theodin (Hill), Eowyn (Otto), and Farromir - all of whom will play important parts in the Fellowship's mission as the story progresses. Two important, but less often present characters are also introduced  Grima Wormtongue (Dourif) and Eomer (Urban). As I discussed in my review of the Fellowship, the casting and acting are perfect, and the new additions are no exception.Andy Serkus' and the animation team's Golem becomes a major character in The Two Towers. Serkus' contributions to the character are profound, and very nicely reflected in the special features for the Two Towers. I look forward to seeing more work from this performer and I sincerely hope that he does not go over-looked or remain type-cast.In the first film, during a valiant and successful attempt to prevent harm from coming to Frodo, Merry and Pippin (Monaghan and Boyd) are carried off by Saruman's army, narrowly escaping into Fangorn forest when the Uruk'Hai party is slain by an exiled band of Rohirim lead by Eomer. The hobbits manage to wind up in the hands of an Ent  a wise old walking tree and steward of the forest, who they try to convince to join in the fight against Saruman and Sauron.Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas continue their dogged attempt to rescue Merry and Pippin, and an old friend unexpectedly re-enters the story as several components of the Fellowship come together to devise an improbable defense of the land of Rohan against the overwhelming force of Mordor.Like The Fellowship, the Two Towers manages to capture the essence of Tolkien's story and characters while rearranging portions for better cinematic continuity and emphasizing interpretive connections which are not wholly obvious in Tolkien's writing. Two elements keep Frodo from the brink of abject insanity  Sam and Smeagol. Smeagol's addiction to the ring allows Frodo to sympathize with him in a way that only an addict can understand. Sam's pure and clear-headed love for Frodo offers a sane and reliable anchor. Other members of the Fellowship help each other in similar ways as Gimli, Aragorn and Legolas prepare for battle and Gandalf works hard to repair the damaged bonds between Rohan and Gondor.The darkest and most uncomfortable of the three movies, The Two Towers is also, in some ways, the most powerful. The themes are morality, sacrifice, friendship and, as always, the nature and just use of power. Many have commented on Tolkien's religious beliefs and their permeation throughout the LOTR, but it is worth noting that the great scholar uses components of many different cultures and belief systems to create the world he portrays, and  from a strict Roman Catholic perspective (Tolkien's religion of choice) - there are many more blasphemies in LOTR than there are catholic metaphors and symbols. In the Two Towers, the internal power struggle between good and evil gains momentum within the fellowship's principal protagonists. As with the fellowship, the art direction, score and soundscaping subtly add great depth to the entire experience.The story and its themes are in no way subordinated to the technical merit of the film, but its methods are still very noteworthy. Golem is not an animated insertion who intrudes in every scene, but rather, a fully developed central character around whom Frodo and Sam's story arc revolves. The sets and landscapes, just like the Fellowship before it, are immersive and in every way as sensually real as if they had been built thousands of years ago and weathered by exposure to the elements of Middle Earth. The battle scenes are exciting, dramatic and believable. And the special features on the Special Edition box set explain how all of this was accomplished with lucidity.",10,8,14,30 November 2007
The Incredibles," Serious original fun! A family film in every sense of the word
","The Incredibles is a simple and slightly formulaic comic book-style animated Disney/Pixar feature with a great big heart. I just experienced this film for the second time, and though I didn't really catch anything new, or achieve a different perspective, I was certainly as entertained as I was in the theater the first time.The Incredibles are the family of Mr. Incredible and Elasti-girl, living in a nightmare future where superheroes have been sued and regulated to the point that they are either forced underground or into protection programs complete with assumed identities and mediocre jobs. Mr. Incredible himself is invincibly physically strong, but emotionally drained by the uselessness of his new life as an insurance claim examiner, and his depression is so complete that he feels as if he is detaching from all that he loves. The children are 'Dash' - a miniature Flash clone, 'Violet' - who has all of the basics of Sue Richards, The Fantastic Four's Invisible Girl, and infant Jack Jack - about whom little can be said. Eventually, the entire family gets swept up into a crisis of vast proportion as a forgotten piece of Mr. Incredible's past comes back to threaten the very world which has rejected them all.The film really does derive a lot of its archetypal character points from Marvel's classic Fantastic Four, but adds brilliant humor, a very positive message, and some voice work which really is nothing less than Incredible. I was especially impressed by Sarah Vowell's Violet. The voice talent in general, however, is exceptionally good, and the supporting cast doesn't slip a centimeter. Brad Bird's Edna is also a memorable stand-out. Visually, the film is as good as any of the recent animated features most movie fans have enjoyed, though perhaps slightly less inventive and a bit less pretentious. I guess I would have to say that it's also my favorite, with Finding Nemo running a close second. This would be a great film to see with your kids. It's clean, fun, and yet serious enough to engage even the most angst-ridden teenager. It also contains some very positive messages about the value and meaning of heroism, family, and 'sticking together' through the worst and the best of times.",7,9,16,17 April 2005
The Mist," The Humanity of Horror
","If, two years ago, you told me that within a couple of years two excellent Stephen King film adaptations would be released, I would probably have laughed it off. Films like The Shining, Shawshank Redemption, Stand by Me, The Stand and 1408 are usually pretty far between (Note that I consider The Green Mile and Carrie to be the most over-rated King adaptations, so they do not appear here). I like most of the films that have been made from Stephen King novels, novellas, and short stories mainly because I like Stephen King, but I do not recommend many of them as truly good films.Frank Darabont's (writing and directing) The Mist adapts a horror novella of the same name. King's horror work has been the most difficult material to adapt, but this film is comparable to other genre stand-outs such as The Shining and 1408.A brief, dramatic thunderstorm is followed by a freak mist that descends on a small New England town. As the mist permeates the town, people congregate in the local supermarket and hardware store to stock up and gather supplies. David Drayton (Thomas Jane), his son (Nathan Gamble), and his neighbor (Andre Braugher) are among them. Tension builds as a steady stream of military vehicles pass through the mist headed south from a nearby base. But serious concern doesn't start until one of the locals runs to the supermarket with blood spatters on his clothing and talking of monsters in the mist.Indeed, there are horrors outside in the fog, but there are also horrors inside the market - as paranoia, irrationality and religion come into conflict with practical issues of survival.Unlike many horror films, The Mist examines fear and its effects realistically, looks at the horror created by forces beyond human control and the even more terrifying horror that fear creates through forces that are completely within our grasp - our own fears, our beliefs and our treatment of each other. It does so using a classic formula which is comparable to films like Night of the Living Dead and, more recently, Feast.The cinematography, editing and directing are all excellent. The acting is quite good - Marcia Gay Harden and William Sadler stood out for me - and the script is exactly where it needed to be for this adaptation.Highly recommended for King fans and horror fans. Recommended for Sci-Fi fans. Weakly recommended for average cinema-goers who are not generally interested in horror.",8,232,354,3 May 2008
I Am Legend," Nice Update of a Classic Sci Fi Piece
","Will Smith gives I Am Legend a powerful performance built upon an excellent script with strong psychological realism and boosted by great art direction and solid directing.Smith plays Robert Neville, a military biologist who may be the last truly human member of Homo sapiens sapiens left on earth. A genetically engineered virus which cured cancer has mutated into a pathogen which has turned 99% of the earth's human population into hyper-aggressive murderous cannibals with no social habits and no mercy. These viral zombies own the world and, from his generator-powered lab in the Big Apple, Lt. Col. Neville struggles to retain his sanity with the help of his German Shepard while almost hopelessly searching for a cure. Each night at sun-down, his patients come out and seek to infect anybody they can find.It's an old story by Richard Matheson, which has been made into three somewhat different films - The Last Man on Earth (1964), Omega Man (1971) and now this. Each of these films is a product of its time, and has a different flavor. The 1964 version, starring Vincent Price, is more of a standard horror flick than the other two, and focuses on creating mood, atmosphere, and tension, then paying off with a modest amount of gore and action. 1971's Charlton Heston more sci-fi film, Omega Man, is heavy, philosophical and more than a little angry and scary.I am Legend loses a bit of the philosophy and anger, retains but reorganizes the action, and adds better characterization, special effects (especially in set design - the abandoned Manhattan is mesmerizing), and writing. But, as if I haven't already made this point, the final key ingredient here is Smith's incredible performance. It is no mean feat filling the shoes of Charlton Heston in one of his most memorable roles, but Smith goes well beyond this and creates a character that is very much his own.I am Legend is on the best post-apocalyptic films recently released, and one of the ten best Zombified horror films I have ever seen. Highly recommended for sci-fi and zombie film fans. Weakly recommended for horror fans - this is a very non-traditional horror film.",7,11,22,17 February 2008
Amadeus," Landmark historical speculation
","Amadeus presents a heavily fictionalized, speculative portrayal of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's last years, focusing powerfully on his relationship with Italian composer Anthony Saliere, and Mozart's wife, Constanzia. My review is based on first seeing the theatrical release in the theater during its first run, and then viewing the director's cut twice. In my opinion, the director's cut is a much better film, though the theatrical release would still earn an 8 from me. Do not approach this movie looking for some objective presentation of historic fact. Do not go into this film expecting to see a tribute to one of the world's greatest composers. Do not see Amadeus in order to understand the workings of musical genius. Inasmuch as all of these are incomprehensible - probably as much to those who lived them as they are today - Amadeus fails to achieve any of these laudable goals. What is does achieve - and quite well - is the blending of elements of Mozart's personality, aspects of his historical context, and an ingenious plot which is spelled out in a very clever narrative style. The truth you get out of Amadeus - as with most good historical fiction films and novels, is the truth of the feeling of a particular time and place.Amadeus immerses its audience in Europe's 18th century, but has just enough anachronism in its script to prevent losing its audience there. Mozart is a young prodigy who struggles with his own ego, over-sensitivity, arrogance, and self-destructiveness against a world which does not really know what to make of him. Salieri (Abraham) is his most ardent fan and admirer, but harbors a deep personal and professional jealousy, as well as an overwhelming self-centered guilt, and an even deeper conviction that his own perceived inadequacies reflect on his relationship to his creator. The third character, much better developed in the director's cut than in previous versions, is Mozart's wife Constanzia (Berridge) - seemingly the only fully rational and practical person among the principal roles. The film narrates the twists and turns of fate - the intrigues and folklore - which, even today tend to crowd out the facts of this part of Mozart's life. Hulce, playing Mozart in what is easily his greatest performance to date, utters a couple of highly anachronistic and off-color remarks in the course of the film. ISince I do not hold historical FICTION to some arbitrary standard of authenticity, I can say that my reaction to these was probably exactly as they were intended: (1) Either Mozart was so creatively explosive that he occasionally happened upon 20th century phraseology through sheer coincidence and/or (2) We are supposed to find these phrases a little shocking and they are used as plot devices to give the film a sense of surreality. Either way, the films works very well as a work of art and a good story, and what some describe as problems of authenticity are, to my mind, nothing more than artistic license. Most movies are not meant to be encyclopedic recitations of 'what really happened'. Keep that in mind before you commit to watching this. The only danger with regard to this film is that it is SO compellingly portrayed that some people are likely to walk away from it believing that this REALLY is what happened. F. Murray Abraham, who almost always does well, exceeds himself in this film, and well deserved his Oscar. Hulce is remarkable and the supporting cast are easily up to the task. The directing is subtle enough to be somewhat refreshingly unnoticeable, and the script and editing are excellent (at least in the director's cut). Very little can be said about the use of period music and costume which has not been said in the numerous awards and the high praise received from critics. This is a great film. Highly recommended for adults of any age.",9,7,10,26 December 2005
Shrek the Third," As clever, but not as funny as the first two
","Shrek The Third is another entertaining romp through the erstwhile Hollywood of Far Far Away with a few laughs for adults and a few more for kids. Like all of the films in this series, it has a big and good heart, and occasionally pays homage to or pokes fun at modern films. Unlike the previous films, however, Shrek III is not a source of non-stop hilarity, and contains a little more thematic content.Shrek finds himself inheriting his father-in-law's crown and learns that Fiona is pregnant. Predictably, both of these eventualities play pretty dissonantly on the big green guy's insecurities, and he goes a-questing to locate the next-in-line of succession - a young, dejected, high school kid. Meanwhile, charming has developed even more of an attitude problem, and is putting together a whole battalion of people with grudges.One of the themes of the first two Shrek films was 'don't judge a book by its cover'. Shrek III takes the theme a little farther and puts a different spin on it. The lesson learned here is 'don't judge yourself superficially.' And it works. My rating of six is based solely on the entertainment value of the film. This film is not quite as well-paced and well-directed as the previous two films, and Charming is simply not the heavy-weight heavy that his mom was. Nevertheless, it's still worth a look, and still carries positive messages entertainingly.",6,68,91,3 June 2007
The Illusionist," Entertaining and well crafted - a little formulaic
","The acting and production was solid. Sewell, Giamatti, Norton and Biel were all excellent. The plot kept my attention - tossing up red herrings and false mysteries and milking them for all they were worth. I can't tell you to what film(s) this owes a heavy debt to without a big spoiler, but I am sure many of you will figure it out.Norton and Biel play childhood sweethearts whose romance has been cut apart by class divisions and a planned arranged marriage. Norton runs off on a quest to discover magic and, in his thirties, returns to Vienna where he almost immediately crosses path with Biel, her jealous and homicidal fiancé (Sewell) and the affable but cynical Inspector under Sewell's thumb (Giamatti). Norton's Magic is so astonishing that nobody can discern how he does it, and eventually, it becomes apparent that the real mystery is not the identity of the murderer, but the methods of the illusionist.The film is clever and manipulative, and does a pretty good job of distracting its audience from the the very question which actually drives the plot. That said, there are problems with believability which don't really detract from the entertainment experience. Recommended!",7,1,1,4 September 2006
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Much Better than the Debut, but the Surfer is a Bit Watered-Down
","The second installment in the Fantastic Four franchise is a more plot-driven reader's digest version of the classic Jack Kirby/ Stan Lee story of the Silver Surfer and Galactus. Those who do not already know what was left out of the screen adaptation will probably not feel the full depth and power of the original work - the Surfer's constant anguish, his loss of identity, the labyrinthine philosophical dialogue and the profound power of Galactus, and the hopelessness of our heroes' situation. Nevertheless, 4: The Rise of the Silver Surfer manages to connect the dots surprisingly well, and distills this great tale to its essence.An astronomical phenomenon has come to earth, bringing with it environmental disasters and warnings of worse to come. The phenomenon is the embodiment of the power cosmic - a being infused with the ability to convert matter and energy at will. What does he want, and how long is the earth to survive? Meanwhile, back at Fantastic Four HQ, Reed and Sue are planning a wedding, and Ben and Johnny are beginning to settle into their characters. As the earth crumbles around them, the couple that binds our team of heroes are considering leaving heroism behind once and for all. But Reed's mind can not be contained, and when Victor Von Doom surfaces with new knowledge about the surfer, his competitive instincts and sense of danger are uncontrollably agitated.I have long held the opinion that the saga of the Silver Surfer could not be made into a successful movie. Thankfully, this film does not attempt to tell the whole story, but only skims the surface of the surfer and Galactus' introduction. Jack Kirby's amazing artwork could never translate properly into the cinematic medium, and - again thankfully - the art directors and screenwriters involved in this film completely re-envisioned and reinvented Galactus, but left the surfer largely intact. In my opinion, this film did what it set out to do as well as it could be done.The cast seemed both more challenged by and more comfortable in their roles in The Rise of the Silver Surfer. The script, editing and directing were all noticeably better than the introductory film, and the special effects were appropriately fantastic.Recommended for fans, but not recommended for purists. As always, comic book fans should not let their expectations run away with them. Film is a different medium, and sometimes requires a radically different story.",7,2,4,29 April 2008
Children of Men," Can an infant's voice hold back a world at war with itself?
","Bottom-line at the top: If you are an ultra-right wing retrogressive this film will probably anger you. Avoid it, and don't bother reading my review. Set in mid-21st-century London, Children of Men is a cyber-punk dystopian nightmare which extrapolates from the worst of contemporary political trends to a bleak future where people have stopped procreating and totalitarian militaristic governments have obliterated civil society, closed national borders, and branded everybody expressing dissatisfaction 'terrorist'. And the 'terrorists' themselves are no better.Theo Faron (Clive Owen) is a disheartened ex-activist and the love of his life - Julian (Julianne Moore) - has just resurfaced asking him for a very big favor. Julian is the leader of a quasi-terrorist organization which wants to reopen Great Britain's borders, and they are trying to help an illegal immigrant who is about to give birth to the first infant the earth has seen in about twenty years to escape to a safe location. Or so it appears at first.Owen gives the best performance I have seen out of him. Michael Caine lends excellent support (and is particularly well cast in his role). Moore, always good, meets her own very high standards with ease. This is my first film experience with Claire-Hope Ashitey - who is as much the star of this film as Owen. All I can say about Miss Ashitey is 'bravo!' - spectacular job with a tough role.Contrary to many of the comments I have read concerning Children of Men, the film is definitely not low-budget. Seventy-two million dollars is no shoe-string budget, and one does not hire Clive Owen, Julianne Moore and Michael Caine without a decent budget. What's remarkable about allocation of financial resources for this film, however, is how invisible the budget is (besides the expensive cast). The special effects are so well done that they achieve subtlety and are almost unnoticeable - very rare in contemporary sci-fi.Cuaron's direction is equally invisible, and flawless. Without resorting to shaky-cam clichés and intentionally degraded cinematography, he achieves a documentary feel - but only when he needs it. The sets are perfect, as is the lighting and camera-work. The cinematography creates more than just mood - it embellishes a completely immersive and quite disturbing context for the entire film. Dark, dirty and degraded, Cuaron creates a world where hope survives only despite life itself, and only in a few. Whether you interpret human infertility as a wake-up call from God or a natural evolutionary process is your own muddle - don't bother spreading it, the result is much the same.This is a heavy film, but does not present its subject in a heavy-handed manner. What is disturbing about it is how easy it is, given the state of the world's politics and the expert craftsmanship of the film, to believe. The connection between the world of today and that of the film is made particularly clear by the set shots in Jasper Palmer's (Michael Caine) house. Palmer, a former journalist who has exiled himself from 'civilization', has newspaper clippings all over his walls which decry the invasion of Iraq and several yet-to-happen humanitarian catastrophes. Sure, none of what this movie predicts is likely to happen but what's frightening is how possible it actually seems. Highly recommended for open-minded, thinking people.",9,18,32,3 June 2007
Garden State," Growing Up and Loving
","Zach Braff's Garden state is a successful coming-of-age story focusing on a standard personality type in early 20th century suburban America - the over-medicated dysfunctional male whose moorings are so tenuous that he appears to have no personality whatsoever. Braff depicts this creature o well that it is tempting to wonder whether or not he was acting. And Natalie Portman, his habitually lying love interest, is a perfect compliment.Most of the plot set-up is implied, rather than explicated, and the film is just expository enough to make it all clear. Andrew Largeman (Braff) is detached from essentially everything - starting with his family and even including his own life. His mother dies, and he must return home after a very lengthy period of removal. What he finds there is a bit surprising.Unlike most romantic films, Garden State is intelligent, unpredictable and more disturbing and ironic than it is actually funny. Although it is not a depressing film, it is neither 'feel-good' junk food.The acting is excellent. The script and directing are a little pretentious at times, but this is hardly noticeable. The cinematography is unusually good for this genre.Recommended.",7,3,4,16 June 2008
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Masterfully executed period piece with a point
","Clooney has joined the ranks of Mel Gibson and Ron Howard as recent actors that have proved themselves capable of top-quality directing.Good Night and Good Luck is a film about an aspect of American history that I care greatly about. So I was predisposed to be very critical, and I was hesitant, though excited, to see it.The film, especially Strathairn's intense performance, and the great support from Clooney, Langella and Clarkson, exceeded my expectations greatly. I will enjoy seeing this again, and mining the DVD for commentary and supplementary material.The connection of the McCarthy communist witch-hunts to today's 9-11 9-11 terrorist terrorist mindset should not be lost to the more free-thinking members of the audience, but you should not let the politics of the film distract you from the heroic story it tells and the principle point - which is expressed so ably in Murrow's acceptance speech for a journalism award at the beginning of the film - TV can be a great tool for education, but we should not confuse education and entertainment. The film is shot in black and white. This choice is not simply an attempt to give it 'that period feel', but it is also a profound metaphor for the press and the advent of television journalism. It also gives the few scenes that pit Murrow against McCarth in juxtaposition a sense of reality which could not be achieved any other way.Well, Clooney has managed to make a film that is as entertaining as it is educational, and misses no opportunity to make its central argument clear.I strongly recommend this film to anybody with even a passing interest in the politics of terror, the role of the media in American society, and the value of a free press.",9,11,16,6 May 2006
Evil Dead," Fairly Good Remake - Necessarily Different from the Original
","I approached the Fede Alvares remake of Evil Dead with both trepidation and curiosity. My concerns were simple - Who could possibly improve on a Sam Raimi film? How can you call it Evil Dead without Bruce Campbell?My concerns began to evaporate when I noticed Raimi's involvement in the opening credits and were completely dispelled when I realized that the new film shared only the most fundamental plot structure with the original. Both films are about friends in a cabin in the woods fighting a mysterious, purely evil, and incomprehensible force triggered by a mysterious ancient book. Otherwise, the films are only vaguely connected. So this answered my first question - about remaking a Raimi film. You don't, you simply do something new on the same foundation.The new Evil Dead is much more of a straightforward horror film and the differences go way beyond the disturbing addition of a crack addict as a central character. Most of the central characters aren't even likable, let alone funny. So much for my question about replacing Bruce Campbell. Again - you don't. In 1981, Sam Raimi, his brother, an aspiring actor (Campbell) and a group of non-actors and amateur film makers made a horror classic with almost no budget and a great deal of debt. It took more than a decade for them to recoup the costs of this near-instant cult classic though the film was viewed as a 'break-through'. More recently, as one of Hollywood's most respected directors and producers, Raimi gave young Uruguayan writer / director Fede Alvares a shot at creatively re- imagining the film that made Raimi a contender. The acting is better than that of the original (which should be no surprise since there were really only two actors in the Raimi film), the effects are more sophisticated, but cleverly reminiscent of the Raimi tradition of clever simplicity, and the film, like the original delivers a few good scares despite its ridiculous premise. Shot for about $17,000,000 (which is not much these days), the Alvares re-do netted a 300% profit before it left theaters. Profitability has very little to do with quality these days, but I say good for them! The new Evil Dead is worthy and a credit to the original.",6,3,4,13 February 2014
Shrek 2," Respectable effort with a tough act to follow
","Shrek 2 has as much humor, talent, and fun as the original classic, and almost as much heart. The film picks up where Shrek left off, with Fiona and Shrek celebrating their marriage, but they are immediately cast into a new adventure when summoned to the land of Far Far Away (a clever parody of Hollywood), to the court of Fiona's mother and father, for a surprise royal wedding ball. The only problem, as it turns out, is that Fiona has married the wrong guy - according to everybody but Shrek, Fiona, and their friends.The plot, revolving around this central problem, is helped along by nearly constant allusions to virtually every fairy tale in the English canon, and satirical references to many recent popular films. Unsatisfied with the combination of romantic comedy, Hollywood satire and self-parody, the film-makers' also went all out with a clever original soundtrack, making Shrek 2 as much of a musical as anything else.The voice talent is just as essential as it was in the first film, and there's more of it, with John Cleese and Antonio Banderas giving very memorable performances. And the animation is, unsurprisingly, lovely.To their credit, Dreamworks kept the core talent in place, but created a somewhat different formula for this film. Even though I expect most fans of the first film to adore the second, I am not sure Shrek 2 is going to make the franchise any new fans. Though more clearly made for adult audiences than the original, Shrek 2 is still warm-hearted family fare. As much as I DO recommend this film, and as entertaining as I think it will be for just about anybody, I don't consider Shrek 2 to be quite the classic Shrek was. It's touching and goofy, to be sure, but it's much more of a Hollywood film than the original, and it doesn't quite reach the same levels. Nevertheless, it is one of the better sequels I have seen, and it was definitely worth both the price of admission and a third or fourth viewing of the DVD.",7,36,46,23 April 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Lots of Style, Little Substance
","In Kill Bill I, Quentin Tarantino continues his tradition of paying homage and simultaneously insulting every genre of film vaguely related to his projects. This time around, it's the Tarantino version of Fists of Fury or any of 1000 other martial arts films with lots of wire-work, people who become black-belts in a month or two because they are motivated by revenge (though they skip the part where they develop muscles) and cartoon-violence and gore.Uma Thurmond plays a double-crossed and angry woman who was beaten to the point of death on her wedding day, along with her entire bridal party. Bill is her former employer and also the guy responsible. And her former work associates are the people she's out to kill.Predictably, the characters are, at best, two dimensional, the violence is nicely filmed and almost never ridiculous-looking, and the gore is hilariously ridiculous and the script is as serious as the absurd predicaments it creates. A whole slew of ethnic stereotypes comprise the main characters, and Uma Thurmond's protagonist is a walking cliché about a woman scorned, Lucy Liu is a quintessential Asian- American, etc. Bill, of course, is lifted straight out of Charlie's Angels' Charlie - heard but never seen and yet all-powerful.Despite their vacuousness and lack of any sort of depth, there is a certain post-modern catharsis in the silliness and elaborate and expensive production of Tarantino's essentially grade B- pulp films. If nothing else, they are entertaining in a blood-drenched but otherwise unchallenging way. Leave your brain somewhere else and enjoy.",5,8,14,8 February 2008
The Big Blue," Haunting Rite of Passage Film - MILD SPOILER
","In The Big Blue, brilliant writer/director Luc Besson (Leon, Nikita, The Fifth Element) weaves together romance, comedy and a very serious treatment of disturbing psychological themes (fear of commitment, detachment, refusal of responsibility) into a powerful post-modern drama. Many people see very different themes in this film, but it is essentially a story about growing up (rather late in life) and falling in love. Personally, I found it more disturbing than most of the film's fans.The Big Blue is the story of two boyhood friends - Enzo (Jean Reno) and Jacques (Jean-Marc Barr) - and American insurance claims inspector Johanna (Rosanna Arquette). Jacques and Enzo grow up by the sea in Greece and are very competitive with each other, but share a genuine friendly affection for each other. Johanna falls in love with the psychologically damaged Jacques... Essentially, the plot is about a man who is in love with competition (Enzo), a disturbed man in love with the sea (Jacques) and a woman in love with a man who can not seem to face adulthood with the same fearlessness he approaches deep dive competition. The film centers on annual deep-diving competitions and a budding romance between Jacques and Johanna.Johanna is the most sympathetic character, and Besson stops just shy of telling the story from her perspective. She comes to represent redemption and salvation for the tragically damaged Jacques, and wants nothing more for him (and Enzo too) than a happy life.The cast is excellent. The three principal castmembers give remarkable performances. Barr, who, at times, resembles Keanu Reeves, lends a subtly powerful interpretation to his role. Reno, who obviously likes his character, brings the vital Enzo to vivid life. Johanna may be the under-appreciated Rosanna Arquette's best role.The film is nicely shot, and many reviewers have commented on the lovely underwater scenes with dolphins. Personally, I felt that these scenes went on for too long, and eventually felt gratuitous.",8,0,1,22 May 2008
World Trade Center," Surprising in many respects *MILD SPOILER*
","There seems to be a great deal of confusion in the varied interpretations presented here on IMDb about what this movie attempts to depict. This is not about 9/11, nor is it about heroism, nor is it about terrorism, nor politics. This is, remarkably, a very simple story about survival, the will to live, and the responsibility that goes along with being human. There are a number of nuanced sub-themes (all of those listed above) as well, and the most important of these, from my unique perspective (and I welcome contrary opinions as opposed to labeling them WRONG), is the power of love.What we are given by a refreshingly invisible Oliver Stone in WTC is a story based on objective facts in the lives of two men who remained trapped in the World Trade Center debris for longer than anybody else. The story remains faithful to most of this story, though the Marine who refused to give up on finding survivors was ethnically miscast. Concerns about poetic license aside, the film takes a subject which could have easily fallen into the abyss of exploitation or the minefield of political commentary Stone sometimes flirts with, but instead, WTC tells the story from an appropriate perspective - that of the men themselves, their families, and those attempting to cope with their apparent loss. This is a film which, if mishandled, could have been boring, offensive and pathetic. It is none of those things, though it is also likely to annoy a lot of people who enter the theater with misbegotten expectations.I believe Stone accomplished what he set out to do. I believe Michael Pena was wonderful, and Nicholas Cage, Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal were all very good. And, though his skin color was not historically accurate (and I wonder about the racialism that makes this seem to matter a great deal to some people), I enjoyed Michael Shannon's brief but crucial performance. Moreover, I applaud Stone for doing something many people didn't think he could pull off - making a film without leaving his own ideological signature everywhere in it.Now - back to love. WTC is not a love story. But love permeates its substratum. The love between the two victims whose predicament becomes ours throughout the course of the film; the love within their families; the love of Americans for each other; and the love of a hero for the deity which inspires him. If there is any particular message I took away from WTC, it is that love is often fleeting, always strong, and always in need of maintenance, but that more than any force in the world - religion, politics, or even war and hate - it can help save us all.Set against the backdrop of an American cataclysm which has, at least in some people's historical imagination, outweighed the Great Depression, the bombing of Hiroshima and Pearl Harbor, the hope this movie promotes - and the reminder of that feeling of desperate hope so many of us felt after the day this all really happened - is well worth the price of admission. In this way - while the film really does not treat 9/11 as its major subject - it does capture the spirit and feeling of that fateful day quite wonderfully.",7,22,39,23 August 2006
Logan," Wolverine Does Leon (The Professional) Surprisingly Well
","With strong support from Patrick Stewart and Dafne Keen, Hugh Jackman successfully pulls off a sensitive portrayal of a declining hero and his somewhat self-imposed alienation, decorated with the usual Marvel studios CGI action sequences. While the CGI sequences were as protracted as they usually are in contemporary pop culture movies, they did not detract from the film's strong emotional content and were more integrated into every level of the story than they are in most comic book adaptations. The Wolverine, Logan, (Jackman) may reach an heretofore unrealized peace with himself and his world through his newfound relationship with a young girl who may be his daughter Laura (Keen). However, Laura is being hunted by the same evil that has hunted Logan throughout most of his life, and his Logan's other real connection to humanity, Charles Xavier (Stewart), needs more help than he can give. The most dangerous mind in the world (Xavier) teamed up with one of the most dangerous men in the world (Logan) might seem like an undefeatable juggernaut, but for many reasons, neither of these superhero legends are what they used to be. As the story unfolds, Logan's powerful defense mechanisms are challenged in ways that have, in previous adventures, been his undoing; aspects of Laura's personality and history leave the value of the central adventure wide-open to question; and Xavier's loss of the ability to control his incredible mental powers threaten to expose everything. It really is not clear what will happen in this film until it actually does. Thoroughly entertaining, well-acted, well-paced and surprisingly touching, Logan is one of the best films I have seen from this genre.",8,6,11,3 March 2018
Big Fish," Delightfully bittersweet fantasy
","This may be my favorite of Tim Burton's films. It's a clever, literary, memoir about a man who embellishes his life with fantasy and his son, and how they come together at the end of his life to reconcile the tall tales that weave the tapestry of his life. It's also a story about parental bonds, and learning to love as unconditionally as a parent may.Albert Finney is remarkably moving as the father in his old age, with Ewan McGregor playing the fantastic flashbacks with equal skill. The cast is excellent all around, the cinematography is - as with most Burton films - lush and gorgeous, and the story is endearing. Some may find the pace a little slow, but trust me, it's all very worth it in the end.Billy Crudup plays the son of Ed Bloom, an all American boy who has lead a charmed life. Bloom has created fantasies to embellish every major event in his life and does not distinguish them from reality. His son, who feels alienated by his father's penchant for tall tales, wants desperately to know his father before he passes on, but must slowly come to realize that he already does.While not entirely light-hearted, this is a very entertaining and good feeling film, which touches emotional depths that Burton's work rarely reaches. I recommend it without reservation to anybody who wants a bit more than simple entertainment.",9,1,1,16 June 2005
The Dark Knight," Does What it Set Out To Do
","Frank Miller's The Dark Knight was one of the greatest comic series ever made. I was a young comic book collector when it first came out and I remember buying 5 copies a couple of days after its release and then watching it sell out in a few weeks. The price for the first edition sky-rocketed after just a couple of months to over $100, as second and third runs were printed. What Miller did was nothing short of revolutionary. He depicted the Batman much the same way as the original 1930s Batman comics did - as a nearly maniacal, shadowy vigilante who sets forth to strike fear into the hearts of villains throughout Gotham. But he deepened the internal conflicts, the personal relationships, and the psychological aspects of the stories - especially the 2-3 episodes that dealt with the Joker. Miller's Joker was the flip-side of the Batman. An entirely sociopathic force for chaos and evil - and not entirely unlike the Batman at a deep structural level - driven by a similar kind of megalomania. The commonalities between the characters were just enough to shake Bruce Wayne to his core and to cause him to question everything he stood for.Take note - With Iron Man and this film, Comic Book Films Have finally begun to realize their full potential. Thankfully, The Dark Knight took aspects of Miller's version of the Joker and brought them to the screen faithfully - with adequate but not overbearing special effects, great acting talent, and a script worthy of Miller's work. The Joker, devastatingly played by Heath Ledger, is not the quirky Cesar Romero prankster, nor the slightly demonic Jack Nicholson Commodore of Crime, but rather Frank Miller's ingenious, amoral, homicidal maniac. And he is anything but funny. The Joker reigns terror down on Gotham through a series of increasingly murderous experiments designed to test his nihilistic hypothesis concerning human nature. The Batman is being hunted by a righteous new district attorney for his vigilante approach to justice, and it is becoming increasingly clear that crime has stepped up its skill and intelligence to meet him at his own level. Bruce Wayne, plagued by personal difficulties and the deep conflicts of his dual life considers hanging up his cloak just when Gotham needs him most. But something about the Joker gets way under his skin.The film even captures Miller's dark aesthetic of Gotham and the Batman consistently. Ledger is perfect, Bale is very good (though he was not given the depth afforded the Joker by the script, the story dictates that this will change in the next film), and the excellent, star-studded, supporting cast makes this blockbuster worth seeing by just about anybody. For those who know the story and bring great expectations to this film - you will be rewarded with catharsis. For those who don't - prepare to see something you would never expect from a comic book based film - intense psychological drama and powerfully realized characterization.For those who are just looking for a fun and entertaining action film - you will get more than you bargained for in The Dark Knight, but may find it too lengthy and dark for your tastes.",9,18,37,30 July 2008
Into the Wild," 2008's Version of On the Road?
","Who Is Chris McCandless? A true supertramp? An obsessive, emotionally damaged egomaniac? Suicidal thrill-seeker? A Kerouac-like drifter addicted to the search for an ever-evasive truth? A high-functioning schizophrenic? The 21st century youth culture reincarnation of John Gault? Or just a kid going through a difficult time and looking for some distance to sort it all out? Sean Penn's pop-philosophical examination of this young man's voyage across America, to Alaska, and to the depths of his young soul will give you an interpretation at least. While it is not clear exactly whose interpretation we are seeing, it is very clear that Penn respects his subject and gave this film about as much thought and power as he could inject it with. And the film did remind me of something very true about the self-righteous naiveté of youth.I am not concerned at all with the accuracy of the film, and, while it is tempting to compare this film to Werner Herzog's excellent but less fictionalized 'Grizzly Man', the subjects are really too widely disparate; Herzog and Penn's perspective on humanity is too different to produce a meaningful comparison. The targets of this comparison, too big and too easy. But I will make one comment about the two films - Penn's film is much more or a tribute to its protagonist than Herzog's.I found Into the Wild to be a gripping, thoughtful film. The script was good, but sometimes a bit pretentious - occasionally crossing the line between character development and character worship. Penn's direction and cinematography are masterful. The acting - every member of the cast included - is absolutely excellent.Recommended - but not for light cheerful entertainment.",8,145,222,1 May 2008
Blood Diamond," Zwick does it Again
","After years of watching his films, I have finally discovered that Edward Zwick is one of my all-time favorite directors - and a talented writer and producer as well. Check out his resume and be blown away: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001880/In Blood Diamond, Zwick takes a very talented primary cast (Leonardo DiCaprio, Djimon Hounsou and Jennifer Connolly) and puts them through the meat-grinder of post-colonial African politics, smuggling and murderous revolution. While simultaneously giving us the redemption story Zwick has previously done so well (Last Samurai, Good Will Hunting, etc), cultural study and a bit of tastefully done romance. DiCaprio plays a tragically nihilistic diamond smuggler; Hounsou plays someone who might, under other circumstances, have been one of his victims; and Connolly plays a liberal American reporter whose ex boyfriends refer to her as a crisis junkie. All three get caught up in a bloody and senseless revolution against an equally corrupt government- Both sides support an exploitive diamond-smuggling trade. Hounsou, dragged away from his family during a rebel raid, finds a diamond of rare quality and size while working as a slave to the revolution. DiCaprio needs the stone to pay back a debt and get out of Africa, and Connolly wants to tell the story. The film blends action, strong emotion, and a sense of place with a rare sensitivity. It ranks among Zwick's several great films, but did not sustain my interest quite as well as some of his work. Visually lovely, painfully well-acted, and never exploitative of an easily and often-exploited subject matter, Blood Diamond is a great example of excellent mainstream Hollywood film-making. Highly recommended. A+",8,0,0,7 April 2008
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," It's OK (very OK)
","Very nicely crafted science fiction love story. More of an experience than a film.What? Sci Fi? Well yes. A simple science fiction device, memory erasure, is the vehicle for this beautifully shot, brilliantly edited and directed love fable. The fact that this is a good film does not disqualify it from the sci fi genre. In fact, would-be sci fi writers and film-makers should take note of this.But Eternal Sunshine is a love story first and last, in all respects. The characters are what John Irving would call 'L.A. dysfunctional', although they don't live in L.A. Carrey and Winslet are deeply insecure people with little going for them but good looks (which they try to disguise), fairly sweet dispositions, and a desire for companionship. They meet on Valentine's Day in Montauk, where they have both seemingly traveled 'on a lark', and the entire experience of the film seems to derail from this point forward. Chronological, linear story-telling becomes impossible because the characters are having their memories erased in order to assuage the pain of their separation. No spoilers, so let me stop right there.If I have made Eternal Sunshine seem like it might be too much of a challenge or too disturbing for an evening's light entertainment, be not afraid. Certainly there are occasional disturbing elements, and the characters themselves are all neurotic enough to have walked off the street and onto the screen. But the film is so artistically rendered, and so well thought-out that what could have been a nightmare really becomes a fantastic post-modern love fable. It's also one of those great films that becomes predictable after a while, but is so delightfully portrayed and satisfying that it does not matter.The acting is exceptionally good. I would expect nothing else from this cast. Winslet is especially remarkable for her ability to play a young North East American better than most American actresses could. How this genius has been passed up in each of her 4 Oscar nominations to date is inexplicable. Carrey's talent is undeniable, though I dislike many of the films he chooses to take on. His performance here is easily as good as his award-worthy performances in the Truman Show, Bruce Almighty, and Man on the Moon.We spend a lot of time inside people's heads in this film, yet the camera never becomes a member of the cast as it does in films like 'Being John Malkovich'. I can pay no higher compliment to the production team. This is a very difficult thing to accomplish, and it is done with flawless simplicity in Eternal Sunshine. This film has just joined Shakespeare in Love, Wild at Heart, and Brokeback Mountain among my favorite all-time love stories. This is the first Michel Gondry film I have seen. I am going to make sure it is not the last.",10,93,114,6 May 2006
The Last Samurai," Beautiful
","After my third viewing, I can finally admit that this film has me. I enjoyed it during its theatrical run, enjoyed it more the second time around, and now, I can only say that I love it. The cast is exemplary. Tom Cruise is so good in this film that it is very often easy to forget he is Tom Cruise. Easily his most powerful role and best performance since Jerry Maguire. Ken Watanabe, however, is incredible in every scene - acting with a rare sensitivity and intensity and breathing life into a character much larger and more human than the grand story of which he is a part. Though the entire cast is excellent, I feel that I must also single out Koyuki and Shichinosuke Nakamura for, respectively, the female lead and the emperor, for the subtle strength and believability they each give their very challenging roles.The story takes place during the early modernization of Japan, in the 1870s and 1880s. The Emperor's power has been weakened by the political and economic power of his cabinet, by his young age, and by the political influence of the United States and other western powers pulling the strings of his cabinet and supplying modern weaponry and tactics to the modernizing Japanese army. Cruise plays Captain Allgren, an alcoholic veteran who has seen and participated in too many massacres of innocent people, and is offered an opportunity to reclaim some of his honor by helping to train the Japanese military in the use of firearms. When he arrives in Japan, we learn that the first test of the Japanese army and its new weapons will be against a rebellious group of samurai who believe themselves to be in the service of the Emperor and Japan, but resist the Emperor's cabinet and the influence of western nations. In the power void left by a passive emperor, Japan seems poised to enter into a civil war against its own values, faith and honor. During the first attack on the Samurai, Allgren is captured by the Samurai and begins a spiritual, physical and philosophical journey which will bring him a level of self-respect his own culture could never supply.My interpretation of this journey is that Allgren has found a place and people that offer him redemption, where, in his own world, he can find none. But Allgren's is only a small part of the story - which ultimately revolves around what is right for Japan, for the subjectivity of a whole nation, and how to portray such a subject from its own perspective. Traditional Japan is treated with empathy here, not aggrandizing exaggeration, as some of the film's critics seem to suggest. This is not a film about what is objectively right and wrong, but a film about struggling to understand and empower tradition as a means to control and benefit from change. I find no grand moral statement here, but rather an intense, sympathetic, human drama with a strong sense of honor and sacrifice.Edward Zwick has made a film which operates well at every level, carrying simple but profound philosophical ideas, but avoiding the mistake of making these ideas and the characters that express them super-heroic. Ultimately, this beautifully shot film conveys powerful messages about war, tradition, ethics, honor and culture, which, though not particularly original, are sensitively and intelligently brought forward. There is a lot of action, including some remarkably well-acted sword fighting and martial artistry, but none of it seems unnecessary and the whole film is truly tightly woven. My highest recommendation.",10,544,723,21 May 2005
The Great Raid," Solid traditional semi-historical war film
","In terms of lasting value, I believe The Great Raid is one of the best films to have graced the screen this year. It's a straightforward war movie about unsung heroes. The story involves the basic facts of a Japanese POW camp which was liberated near the end of the Japanese occupation of the Phillipines. American soldiers and Phillipino resistance fighters teamed up to chance a daring raid on the heavily guarded camp. Fictional elements are added to the story, such as a surprisingly compelling love story, and believable explorations of friendships among both prisoners and fighters.The script is good, the acting and editing superb, and the photography is very good. The film is violent, but does not wallow in flying guts and body parts as has been the recent fashion. Nothing flashy, nothing overwhelming, just solid craftsmanship. This is a film which is less concerned with making an impression than it is with telling a story, and I found that very refreshing. In my opinion, the film succeeds completely in telling its simple story and will likely be recognized for years to come as one of the better war films of recent times. All of the acting in this film is excellent, but watch for the standout performances from Marton Csokas, Joseph Fiennes, James Franco and Connie Nielsen.",8,10,12,21 August 2005
The Descent," Entertaining and well made reality-challenged psychological horror film
","It is very refreshing to see a horror film which not only respects but reveres its female characters and allows each to have their own unique strengths and weaknesses. The Descent involves a group of girl friends who get together once a year or so to have an outdoor adventure, whether it be spelunking, riding rapids, or something less death-defying. A year after Sarah's (Shauna McDonald) husband and daughter are killed, they get together near Juno's (Natalie Mendoza) cabin in the Appalachians to explore a cave.The 'Descent' of the film is not just the descent into the cave, but a metaphorical allusion to hell, madness, and death. As things start to go wrong, friendship, and perhaps sanity, begin to rip apart.Setting is very important to The Descent, and though a bit unrealistic, the cave environment is very nicely detailed and well portrayed. The cinematography is excellent. Tension and horror are achieved without buckets of blood and gore, and the film suggests much more than it shows - to great effect. The film is tightly directed and very well edited - not surprising from Paul Marshall given his credentials.The story descends somewhat beyond the initial forays into unreality, but this is done with a level of insinuated ambiguity which implies something important about the plot. Avoiding a spoiler, I can not elaborate further... But anybody expecting a documentary from this film deserves what they get.A great deal of credit for making The Descent the success that it is should go to the ensemble cast. The two leads - Mendoza and McDonald give stellar performances, but the entire cast deserves credit for making this film stand apart from the pack. The extras on the DVD indicate that Marshall gave each of the women considerable space with which to flesh out their characters and it is suggested that some liberties were taken with the script as well. If this is so, then the creativity, talent, and intelligence of this bunch should not go overlooked. Each character is beautiful, beautifully developed, and beautifully played - and each in her very own way.The Descent borrows a bit from films such as Alien, Pitch Black and even Lord of the Rings (you will understand this when you see the film), but still, it is several steps above the average horror film.Highly recommended.",8,11,19,2 October 2007
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Fun, even from an outsider's point of view
","The only experience I have had with Harry Potter is the first film. My spouse reads the books fanatically and sporadically sees the films. A number of my friends also do both. I've not read the books and not really kept up with all the movies, but I can say that I really enjoyed this film. Like the first, it was well made, intelligent, and visually interesting. Nevertheless, don't expect to get it all if you haven't kept up with the books, and if you have, don't expect to be given it all. Movies can not be as rich as books - especially lengthy and well written ones.This film finds Harry experiencing frightening dreams and mysteriously enrolled in a deadly wizard's tournament which he is too young to be part of, mentored by a new professor with unusual teaching methods, and experiencing serious growing pains. His friends Hermione and Ron are also back, and so are his usual teachers, and they are all just as likable as ever. Despite the inexplicable rating, this is a family film, well worth seeing for its entertainment value.",6,2,3,24 November 2005
The Fountain," The Great Duality Squeezed through a Post-Modern Cake Decorating Kit
","The Fountain offers a variety of perspectives on life and death which ring true partly because, like most great spiritual beliefs, they express no specifics nor do they exhaustively explain themselves. In fact, just like many systems of belief that incorporate the notion of spirits and other profoundly affective/effective works of art, the film remains plausible by steadfastly refusing to make perfect and consistent sense in any but an aesthetic and 'gut' manner. Its ambiguity allows you to insert your own personal gods and demons wherever you wish so that you can end up saying that you both 'agree with' and 'understand' it. Having said all of this - the film resonates strongly with my own beliefs (it will not do so with everybody), and expresses many things which I find attractive. The film can be interpreted as a piece of hardcore areligious psychological rationalism, and a simultaneous and completely complementary celebration of the infinite cycle of life springing from death and visa versa. The Fountain succeeds as a spiritual messenger incorporating ideas from a variety of religious sources (most profoundly Native American concepts) and also achieves the believability of good science fiction film because it carefully ties the parallels between the spiritual (the action of Izzy's book and Tommy's final chapter) and the real (Izzy's death and Tommy's denial about its inevitability). There are essentially two plots, which appear, given the Slaughterhouse-5-like approach to chronology, to be several plots early in the film. The future and the past turn out to be components of a book being written by a surgeon's dying wife and completed by him after her death. The surgeon, from whose perspective we experience the story, must finish the story - a gift from his beloved to allow him to discorporate some of the demons regarding their relationship by formalizing the grieving process through creative expression (Our hero, Tommy is pretty intensely wound up throughout most of the film, and it is obvious that his road to enlightenment will not be the smoothest or straightest one around). The plots are as follows: The Real - sci-fi story about a brilliant surgeon who is trying to invent a cure for death - inspired by his dying wife. This plot is appropriately intense, and not very merciful.The Spiritual/Fantastic - the same individual and his wife playing characters in her novel about a conquistador trying to find the fountain of youth and the tree of life, who later becomes an astronaut willing to sacrifice himself for the rebirth of the universe.All the while, Tommy (Jackman) is beginning to come to grips with his own mortality. Both plots are very carefully thought-out, nicely visualized, and well performed. The connections between them are very nicely paralleled through the narrative, and yet the film does not hold its audience's hands as it wanders through unfamiliar territory, but rather challenges its participants to interpret. The only problem I had with the intertwined story-lines is that the 'real' story was overpopulated with over-dramatic moments, unlikely somewhat forced coincidences and occasional visual and script clichés. The characterizations are all particularly good, and some (particularly Weisz, Jackman and Burstyn) will definitely stick with you after you've seen the film. However, the hyperbolic drama of the 'real' story sometimes makes the lead characters appear to over-act. Visually, the film is an absolute treat, and although it tries to sell itself as an independent art piece, the $35+ million dollar budget shows - in a tasteful and sensually powerful way. The use of sound is nothing special, but doesn't detract from the entertainment value or the ideas. The camera-work is generally good, but I felt that there were perhaps too many gratuitous crying scenes shot with extreme close-ups. Darren Aronofsky has established himself as a force to be reckoned with in mainstream, commercial, artistic film making. I look forward to his on-going growth as a director with enthusiasm.",8,10,17,5 July 2007
Zombieland," Entertaining and Original Horror-Comedy
","Mad Cow Disease has mutated into a cannibalistic zombie-producing virus to which only a few people are immune. If adding four emotionally damaged characters including a Twinkie-obsessed nihilistic urban cowboy (Woody Harrelson), a paranoid hypochondriac teenage shut-in (Jesse Eisenberg) and a two-sister teenage con-artist team (Abigail Breslin and Emma Stone) doesn't sound like enough to turn this cyberpunk nightmare into a laugh-out-loud comedy, why not throw in Bill Murray playing himself? I don't see many modern comedies. The theme of 21st century comedy is more often than not stupidity, which does not amuse me. What enticed me to see this film was the combination of the concept and Woody Harrelson. With the exception of 2012, Harrelson has not made a lot of bad career choices, and - let's face it - zombies have great comedic potential. I was mostly unfamiliar with the rest of the primary cast (Murray's role is a cameo), but, midway through the film I recognized Abigail Breslin from the excellent Little Miss Sunshine. Despite its unusual premise, Zombieland, like most contemporary comedies, is presented from the perspective of a twenty-something male - its target demographic. Eisenberg's character tells the story as something between a diary and a primer on survival in Zombieland. Predictably, his romantic interest - played by Stone - is the least well-developed character in the film. Harrelson and Eisenberg's characters, however, are more than enough to carry Zombieland.As with many contemporary comedies, it is not very strongly plotted, but unlike many of of its competitors, its characters are made memorable by a script which makes the most out of both the acting talent and the plot's significant elements. My only disappointment with this film was what seemed like an unnecessarily wandering and lengthy transition between the film's first (survival) and second plots (learning how to care), bridged by the Bill Murray cameo. While this transition offered some crucial back-story concerning the primary characters, its lack of action seemed incongruous with the rest of the film. Nicely paced and filmed, smarter than average, and funny, Zombieland is worth seeing - once.",7,4,7,14 March 2010
The Departed," Tight, intense thriller
","The best cast of the year 2007 makes this Americanized adaptation of an original Hong Kong film (Internal Affairs) shine. William Monahan's adapted screenplay has been nominated for an Academy Award, the film is nominated for best picture, Scorsese for best director, and there are a couple other nominations out - somewhat inexplicably including Mark Wahlburg for supporting actor for his roles in this film. Wahlburg's performance, though excellent, is really little more than a cameo, and he has actually done better work (e.g. his roles in The Yards and Perfect Storm). But the Academy won't give him an Oscar for this, especially since he is up against a few Academy favorites and a veteran (Arkin). While I do not think this is Scorsese's best film, nor the best film of the year, it is one of the finest serious crime thrillers I have seen in a very long time.The film is set in Boston, and relies on stereotypes of that city and its ethnic groups that only slightly detract from the film's believability. Despite the fertile ground for psychological examination, the film's slightly absurd pace (DiCaprio becomes a trusted confidant of a crime boss in 3-4months???) the film is not a character study, and, rather, relies on archetypes of good cop/bad cop which are employed pretty consistently and to varying degrees throughout the film. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a performance that exceeds his own high standards, opposite Matt Damon in a life and death cat and mouse game. DiCaprio is undercover for the police infiltrating organized crime, Damon is undercover for an organized crime boss (Nicholson) infiltrating the police. Vera Farmiga is excellent as the police psychologist who ends up connected to both. Damon also gives a nice, edgy, though a little detached performance, and stalwarts Nicholson, Baldwin and Sheen do some of their best work in years. The Boston accents only occasionally slip into exaggeration (and surprisingly - are only over-done by actors who have lived in Boston!).The acting is generally outstanding. The cinematography is above average - there are too many straight pans and rhythmic fast cuts, but the action is always well framed and nicely emphasized by the camera. The direction is, as with most Scorsese work, tight, economical and clean. The script is excellent, and, in my opinion, is likely to give Babel a run for its money for the adapted screenplay Oscar. Contrary to some opinions I have seen here, I did not feel that the soundtrack added much to the film. In fact, if I were to fault the film for anything it would be sound. Excellent film, well worth seeing if you can handle the nihilism and violence it portrays.",8,11,21,12 February 2007
War of the Worlds," A good take on the Wells story. Better than the 1953 classic in some ways
","First - a quick rebuttal: The peanut butter sandwich which seemed to stick to the window impossibly. This was a very visually interesting scene. In fact, the scene was shot from inside the house, and Cruise was shot in reflection against the window - so there is no problem here other than the reviewer not thinking what they were seeing through.Now on to the review...This film follows Tom Cruise - playing a not-very-adult divorced father - and his two kids through the Wellsian version of The War of the Worlds. Despite the fact that the film focuses exclusively on the harrowing experiences of this somewhat dysfunctional family, in a very basic way it preserves the elements of the original novel. As with Wells' book, a science savvy viewer will pick up on the biological plausibility of the main plot and realize the brilliance of Wells original points. Scientifically educated viewers will also recognize the geological impossibility of it. Neither of these facts should detract from the entertainment value of this interesting and exciting film. After all, it is a testament to Wells' genius that a novel written nearly 100 years ago still holds our attention today, and is still regarded as an intelligent take on improbable events.An alien species, about which nothing is really known, has been planning to take over and terraform earth for millenia, or perhaps much longer. Using unknown technology, they manage to emplace operatives in enormous tripod machines equipped with horrendous weapons that basically carbonize any life forms they take aim at. The tripods had been implanted deep in the earth long before the advent of our species. There simply is no stopping the invasion. Cruise, whose character is not really built for heroism, digs deep into his soul to protect his children as they attempt to make it to Boston to reunite with his estranged wife and her new family.Before I discuss the technical merits of the film, and the lavish production values, I feel that I need to make a comment on Dakota Fanning. Ms. Fanning gives one of the best performances I have ever seen a sub-12 year old give in The War of the Worlds. She is a match for Cruise, and actually manages to steal several scenes from him. The acting in this film is uniformly good, but Fanning really stood out.Spielberg and his team make seemingly impossible film visions come alive in a uniquely well realized manner. War of the Worlds is one of the most visually stunning films I have seen in a long time. Though I would not call the special effects innovative, they are, more importantly, convincing and never over-done. The nearly first person story telling technique is both original and effective, and the non-heroism of Cruise's character makes for a much more compelling plot than I expected to see. There are indeed some problems with believability, but let me ask - why would anybody go to this film expecting something more realistic than a fairy tale?Recommended for Wells fans, fans of the original 1953 adaptation, and action sci-fi fans. Mildly recommended to the average cinema-goer.",7,230,415,9 July 2005
Army of Darkness," Camp Horror Classic - Close to perfection.
","Army of Darkness is one of my all-time favorites. Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi reinvent the Evil Dead series in this off-the-wall, tongue-in-cheek self-parody. Ash (Campbell) is transported to the European middle ages and must confront an army of deadites lead by his alter-ego 'Bad Ash'. Campbell's comedic acting is absolutely superb and the revamped Ashe character is an unforgettable hero and bumbler. In terms of entertainment value, AoD hits its mark perfectly - it redefines B film making by being self-consciously and intentionally hilarious. It is one of the most entertaining films in my collection.The special effects are fun, but (and everything in this film is intentional) completely and overtly 'B-film'. Every aspect of the production works simultaneously toward building the story, the characters and humor.There are many versions of this film available on DVD. If you enjoy any one of these, chances are you will enjoy the others. The only really major difference is between the theatrical release and the 'Bruce Campbell vs. Army of Darkness' version - which, featuring a completely different and more consistent ending, is my personal favorite. If you like this film, chances are you will want to watch it repeatedly. The Vs version also has very entertaining commentary from Campbell and Sam and Ivan Raimi.I am still hoping that the now wildly successful Sam Raimi will eventually revisit the Evil Dead series. Campbell is clearly interested in doing this, and the possibilities are certainly limitless.",10,12,15,16 October 2006
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Over-rated lampoon treatment of the 1970s
","While a few aspects of this film were amusing - especially the casting of most of Hollywood's big name comic actors in the role of competing anchormen, the talking dog scenes, etc. This film does not, in my opinion, deliver any worthwhile insights and is not really funny when stripped of it's extremely superficial 1970s paint job.Note that the film's IMDb rating averages around 5 for people who actually lived through the 70s and around 7 for those who did not. The film was probably written for the same crowd that enjoyed 'That 70s Show', and uses the same absurd and extremely inaccurate symbols, style and politics to create a totally fantasized (and incidentally perverse) 'sense of the times'. Essentially, this is a view of 70s culture through the lens of 70s TV cameras, 00s conservative social and political regressivism, and the knowledgeable sensibilities of comedy writers who were, for the most part, preadolescent during the subject period.The film is about a lot of amazingly stupid people, most of whom are not very likable, who happen to be in the TV news industry. Some of the news broadcast scenes are actually funny. Ron Burgundy - played by Ferrell- is the head idiot. Burgundy is a cross between a 1970s porn star and Ted Baxter of the Mary Tyler Moore Show. His character exhibits just about a much depth as these two stereotypes - though perhaps less than Baxter in Ted Knight's better moments on MTM. His dog, ****__Baxter__****, is the most intelligent character in the film and, IMO, steals the show.Burgundy is struggling to save his career as he is confronted with an only slightly more intelligent stereotype of a 1970s career-woman (complete with the usual inaccurate stereotype female dilemma which people of today's generation seem to believe to be characteristic of the period - she has to decide between an uncontrollable sexual attraction and her certain knowledge that the guy she's attracted to is an imbecile and a cad who wants to ruin her career almost as much as he wants to slither into her undergarments). The plot could have provided a vehicle for comedic analysis of 1970s sexual politics, but - perhaps wisely - the writers avoided any intelligent analysis (only those who lived through the 70s would have gotten it, and most of us would not have gone to see this film anyway).As far as media critique goes - well, there really isn't any. The film simply doesn't carry that much weight and systematically misses every opportunity to accomplish anything besides half-hearted chuckles and giggles.The cinematography is standard for the genre - and very average. the writing is OK, though drastically inhibited by its apparently improvised overall direction and the lack of defined themes and depth. The cast does a good job, considering limitations of the material. Steve Carrell is, as always, very entertaining. And the cameos, though merely exploitive of star-power, are amusing. Baxter, however, steals the show. And I would have been much more entertained by the film had he been a more prominent character. I would enjoy a sequel featuring Baxter as a 1970s canine Zen superhero.",4,27,56,7 January 2007
American Gangster," Opinion of a mob movie non-fan
","I do not, generally, enjoy movies about organized crime. Even the combination of Ridley Scott, Denzel Washington, and Russel Crowe did not entice me enough to lure me into the cinema for American Gangster. Although I now lament this missed opportunity, I have to say that the Collector's Edition DVD set was well worth the wait and the expense. Almost uniquely, the bonus features offer penetrating authentication of this essentially true story about the rise and decline of 1960s/1970s crime boss Frank Lucas (Washington) in Harlem.Opposite Lucas, and very interestingly mirrored by him throughout the film, is Essex County, New Jersey, policeman Richie Robertson (Crowe) a stalwartly honest cop who is waging a personal and professional war on drugs and corruption. The lives of the two protagonists are remarkably paralleled in the film, and the eventual culmination of the story will probably surprise those who are unfamiliar with the history of Lucas and Robertson. And the characterization (from top of the bill to the bottom) are excellent.Essentially, this is a heroic tale, but it is also a great deal more which I can not tell you about without writing a spoiler.The subject matter is decidedly not appropriate for young people. There are graphic scenes of heroin abuse and some rather cavalier treatments of human life which are affective and appropriate in contextualizing the subject of the film.The film is well directed, perfectly paced and casted, nicely edited and phenomenally well acted. Crowe and Washington reach their usual high standards, and Josh Brolin, Ruby Dee, Ted Levine, John Hawkes and Armand Assante provide great support.Unlike many films in this genre, action is very much subordinated to story and character development. In fact, action is actually given just a few quick minutes of screen time.Recommended for fans of Scott and the cast. Very highly recommended for fans of true crime drama.",9,1,2,15 October 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Better than expected. Best of 1-3
","After Episode 1, I had nearly written off the Star Wars series. When I saw Episode 2, I found myself interested again. However, after 2, I have to admit that I dreaded the release of Episode 3. I knew that what I felt was the weakest and most irritating aspect of Episode 2 - the love story between Anakin and Padmé - would become a major theme in episode 3. While I understood then, as I do now, that this was an important element of the overall plot of the series, I never felt compelled to care about it. Portman and Christenson just did not seem to have any chemistry and I felt that the scripts became clichéd, one dimensional and pretentious in every one of their scenes together. If my rating of 6 sounds harsh to you, please keep in mind that I ADORED A New Hope - seeing it no less than 4 times on its first run in the theaters and a couple times in its re-released special edition, but - for me A New Hope is the only film in the entire pair of trilogies I would rate above an 8, and I am not sure I would give any of the rest an 8. Episode 3, however, is a worthy addition to the Star Wars series, bringing back the elements of intelligent political intrigue, beautifully shot fast-paced action sequences and special effects, and clear lines between good and evil. It's a nice wrap up for the saga and does much to explain, if nothing else, why Lucas chose to present the series in the way that he did. My only complaint about Episode 3 can be summed in two words - 'Hayden Christenson'. I felt he was miscast in Episode 2, and in both 2 and 3, I felt that his acting needed at least a few more years of development. He is blown off the screen in almost every dialog with any other actor in the cast, and though he does a good job with his interpretation of the rise of Darth Vader, it seems that camera angles and direction might have been what saved him in the scenes where he excelled. Though many reviewers feel that Anakin's transition to the dark side took place too quickly and was poorly examined, I believe that all of the elements of internal tension and conflicting desire (Anakin has always been power-hungry, head-strong and too easily flattered into compliance) have been in the script since Episode 2, I have to fault the actor and the director for failing to bring these problems to life in a more vivid and powerful way. The rest of the cast is quite good. Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Ian McDiarmid were particular impressive. Although McDiarmid's physical acting occasionally challenged belief, his portrayal of Palpatine was spot-on. McGregor, by episode 3, has absolutely come to define Obi Wan Kenobi as much as the great Alec Guinness did. I really enjoyed watching him act as Alec Guinnes acting as Obi Wan Kenobi, and adding a bit of his own unique style to the character. Episode 3 is not just a fan movie, but an exciting and interesting experience and a vast improvement over episodes 1 and 2. While it will disappoint many of the more closed-minded fans, I can recommend it to sci-fi action fans in general, and those who felt alienated from the series by Episodes 1 and 2. It's not quite the wild time that A New Hope was, but, in it's own way, it might just become a classic over the years.",6,9,15,28 May 2005
Ray," Phenomenal biographical film with intense and memorable performances
","Jamie Foxx leads a brilliant cast in this powerful voyage through the life of the blind, emotionally troubled, African American genius of pop jazz, Mr. Ray Charles. Though the entire cast performs wonderfully, Mr. Foxx earned more than simply an Oscar. If it were possible to nominate an actor in consecutive years, I would consider doing so for Mr. Foxx. Foxx doesn't just play Charles, he re-creates him. CJ Sanders and Sharon Warren also deserve special mention for their portrayal of Ray's mother (the inspiration of his life) and young Ray. These two provided the strongest support in the film.The dramas of Charles' struggles with guilt, the death of his younger brother and mother, blindness, discrimination, addiction, and success, are neatly woven into the tapestries of his music. The music is beautiful, the script is, as far as I can tell, perfect, and the acting is nothing short of legendary.The directorial method of the film warrants discussion. Taylor Hackford - a director I am generally ambivalent about - had to choose what aspects of the larger-than-life and complex life story of Mr. Charles would tell his story most honestly, dramatically, and understandably. Though some disagree (seemingly wanting a documentary instead of a dramatized biopic) I believe he selected his themes admirably. A big part of the success of this film is its consistent focus on a few persistent themes in Charles' life - his profound love and respect for his mother, his need to be loved and accepted, his addiction and guilt complex, his musical genius, and his deep-seated fear of responsibility for others. Charles is depicted as a man struggling valiantly against an army of personal demons. I learned more than I could have imagined about one of the men I used to listen to on my old turntable with my dad in his livingroom on Sunday nights while football games were on the TV. And nothing was sugar-coated in 'Ray.' The themes are carried forward with power and human dignity. These themes create a unifying drama which span the length of his long and illuminated life. The power of these themes, the strong script and directing, the music, and the acting make this one of the most enjoyable and evocative biographical films I have seen.Recommended for everyone.",10,40,48,28 June 2005
Lord of War," Tries hard, but doesn't really make it's point (MILD SPOILER)
","A good cast, decent directing and good editing do not make up for a lack of content. This is especially so in the case of a film which pretends to educate about a very serious subject - such as the arms trade. And even more so when said film claims to be based on actual events.Whatever actual events were sewn together to create Lord of War, their 'actuality' did little to help me suspend my disbelief. The nearly constant voice-over narration didn't help either. Like many other Andy Niccol films, Lord of War has an odd humor which seems to dwell just below the surface, but unlike The Truman Show, S1m0ne and the brilliant Gattaca, it does not work with the very serious and deadly themes in this film. Niccol has done some brilliant and near-brilliant work, but Lords of War is, IMO, his weakest effort thus far.In Lords of War, Nicholas Cage plays Yuri - a completely merciless gun-runner, Jared Leto plays his cokehead brother, Ethan Hawke plays an Interpol Agent (why does Hollywood perpetuate this myth????) pursuing him, and Bridget Moynahan plays his completely in-the-dark wife. Cage is fairly convincing, but the script creates problems for his role. Leto and Hawke are outstanding.The film chronicles Yuri's rise to power and the fulfillment of many of his dreams, falling victim to many clichés along the way, before yielding to an enormous cliché in the end.While the film certainly spends a lot of time examining how guns are moved about illegally from place to place (and most of the scenarios are highly improbable), it really fails to make any profound points or provide any deep insight into the busine$$ of war. Anybody interested in seeing the film is very likely to know most of what this film tries to teach before they walk into the theater. It is difficult to imagine the film doing anything but preaching to its own choir.So, if you think the business of selling arms is morally corrupt, and are entertained by seeing your own views illustrated in an exaggerated, propoagandistic and highly unrealistic manner, with a lot of voice-over in place of coherent visual narrative, then this might just be the film for you. O/W I can only recommend it for fans of the principal cast, whose performances outshine the story and the roles they were given.",5,20,39,10 June 2007
1408," Best King Horror Adaptation since The Shining
","John Cusack gets drunk and trashes a hotel room. What could be more fun? Well, how about a hotel room that isn't just haunted, but is actually a place where the universe's physical laws - especially the ones that deal with trivial matters such as space and time - don't really apply, and the room itself is a sentient manifestation of evil. Getting better? Well, what if we give our 'sentient manifestation of evil' a consciousness and the ability to penetrate and read the subconscious minds of anybody who happens to be in the room and then show them their worst fears or deepest pains?Still not satisfied? OK - just for the sheer hell of it (and there is plenty of sheer hell to go around in this film) - why not make Cusack a self-righteous investigative documentarian who is going around debunking hauntings all over the U.S., but is actually in denial about enormous emotional problems centering around his daughter's death and his own childhood. If this sounds like fertile ground for entertainment, and you don't mind getting scared half to death, you should go see 1408 right away. It was long ago, and I was different person when I read the Steve King story upon which this film is based, so I can't really comment on how close to the text 1408 is. What I can say, however, is that this film is a more true representation of the feeling of King's writing and pacing than almost any I can think of. This is also the first film I have seen in many years that actually made my skin crawl (across the floor of a crowded theater). The film wastes relatively little time setting up Mike Enslin's character and situation, but once its all on the table, you find yourself incapable of escaping either. I have seen a couple of reviews which attack 1408 for lack of characterization. These reviewers must have wandered into the wrong theater, because they've not seen the same film I just saw. My advice to these reviewers is - try paying more attention to what your watching instead of your pre-conceptions about the genre. Cusack's character is beautifully set up - from his editor's 'he can get kind of morose.' to his more-or-less constant drinking, painful flashbacks focusing on his daughter, and inability to communicate with people he cares about. It's all there, for those who have the attention span and sensitivity to look for it. Cusack's performance is a tour-de-force of physical and psychological acting. Having a hard time imagining him in this role? Take what Cusack did in 'Being John Malkovich', quadruple the intensity, the fear, and the suspense, add alcoholism and self-denial, and there you have Mike Enslin. I never doubted that Cusack had the raw talent, but was actually surprised to see him pull it off SO well. Although the films are radically different, this could be for him what 'Leaving Las Vegas' was to Nick Cage, or what 'Hollywoodland' should be for Ben Affleck. The rest of the cast all have fairly minor roles, but are fine. Mikael Hafstrom did a very nice job with directing. There is never a pointless scene, nor a dull moment, nor any loose ends. The plot is spelled out in detail, and all the clues are there to unravel the mysteries, but the clues are not so unsubtle as to permit you to guess what's next. As I said before, the feeling and pace of King's work come through very nicely. The special effects are all very convincing (relatively little CGI, and where animation was used, it was very well done),and the camera-work is picture perfect. I was especially impressed by the fact that 1408 cost about $25,000,000 to make - a mere pittance compared to many of the schlock-fests Hollywood horror has tossed up recently. Very highly recommended for people who tend to sleep easily at night. If you are an insomniac, catch a matinée like I did.",8,122,167,24 June 2007
Iron Man," Heavy Metal
","Tony Stark - playboy, technological genius, and CEO of the world's largest defense contractor - is about to have a major change of heart. Inexperienced in the reality of war and arms trading, Stark is about to become a prisoner of of a terror cell in Afghanistan. The experience will change everything for him. To escape, he must exceed his greatest technological achievements, and in so doing, he envisions a new way to live for him and his firm.Iron Man is, far and away, the best film adaptation of a comic book 'origin story' that I have seen adapted to film. Marvel is certainly on a roll at the movies, but the real genius here is not just in the original material. The casting, script and directing make Iron Man a thorough-going success. The film has the pace of a military thriller (though it is more of an action film), the visual appeal of a well-crafted sci-fi spectacular (though it never sacrifices story to spectacle), and an abundance of talent (although star power does not drive this film).Robert Downey Jr, Jeff Bridges (Obie Stane) and Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper) own the screen, and are nicely supported by Terence Howard and a number of talented character actors. Downey is a perfect Tony Stark - flippant, too-smart-for-his-own-good, utterly dedicated and - at times - hilarious. While the film is far from a one-man-show, Downey's performance could have made this a great comics film even without the fine work by the rest of the cast.I was also pleased by the appearance of S.H.I.E.L.D. in the film, and hope that their appearance is a foreshadow of things to come, not just a cameo.Highly recommended for fans of the genre.",9,16,28,4 May 2008
The Deer Hunter," Powerful Examination of the Effects of the Viet Nam War on the American Psyche
","Michael Cimino's Oscar-winning drama The Deer Hunter, examines the devastated lives of a few Viet Nam veterans and their friends and families back home. The story centers around Mike (DeNiro) a quiet man with a strong sense of responsibility and an ambiguous moral character. In his immediate orbit are his two closest friends - Nick (Walken) and Nick's young wife Linda (Streep). With the war over, Nick wants to put things right in his home town, but finds that his society may not have an easy place for him and his fellow POWs to come home to.Through nicely integrated flashbacks, we learn who Mike and his friends are before and during the war. Nick, Mike and their friend Stevie were captured and forced to play Russian Roulette by their captors. The meaninglessness of life symbolized by this deadly game is an excellent dramatic device alluding to the war itself, and the clash of cultures that it involved. Each man's participation in the game would, to an extent, both literally and figuratively, determine the course of the rest of their lives, no matter how long or short.The entire cast is excellent and Cimino gets exactly what was needed out of them all, but Walken and DeNiro are truly incredible. The two men not only have great on-screen chemistry, but yield performances which, for most actors, would be considered performances of a lifetime. Anybody who has ever questioned the talent of either of these two men should be forced to watch this film.The story is not very highly embellished and will bore those with poor attention spans and/or limited ranges of emotion. The action sequences and special effects are few and far between - and entirely realistic. The soundtrack is virtually unnoticeable and never gets in the way of the story. The settings are lovely and provide an appropriate contrast to the disturbing story.The Deer Hunter is a psychologically devastating examination of a traumatized nation, where those who participated in the war are completely aware in every waking moment of what was lost and those at home have been sold a huge pack of lies. As relevant to Americans of the Bush era as it was to those of the Nixon era, this film well deserves the awards and acclaim it has retained for the last 20+ years.Highly recommended, but not for the timid.",9,0,1,24 May 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Part 3: It's Not Really the Thought that Counts
","Just as Peter Jackson felt that LOTR had to be made as one large, three-part, cinematic piece, I decided to write my IMDb review of all three movies as a single, multi-part essay. Click on my screen-name and hit 'Chronological' to view my reviews of the Fellowship and Two Towers. I make no guarantees about the quality and consistence of my review, but I do guarantee that these three films offer very high and very consistent quality from beginning to end. The acting, cinematography, art, and direction simply can not be beat.Which of the three movies is my favorite varies with my mood  and the same holds true for Tolkien's books. When I am immersed in the story, ROTK is my favorite. When I simply want to have fun with the whole experience, I love Fellowship. And when I want something intense, evocative and thoughtful, I go for the Two Towers.Frodo, Sam and Golem are on their way to Mount Doom and their bodies, nerves, and relationships have borne the greatest burden on middle earth. The rest of the fellowship is rallying to the defense of Minas Tirith, and preparing for even more deadly battles to come.The heroism and romance are incredibly moving - when was the last time you saw an entire audience leaving a theater after a fantasy movie rubbing their eyes? The sets are breathtaking - even moreso than in the previous two films.The casting and acting are superb.The film delivers at every level and is the jewel in the trilogy's well-earned crown.Return of the King offers a resolution of all of the major story arcs in LOTR. As with the classic Tolkien trilogy, however, you may be able to predict some of what will occur, but never all of it and you'll never guess how you will get there. The same fatalistic and paradoxically unpredictable feeling of Tolkien's grand plots is present throughout ROTK especially. The major theme in ROTK, however, is the varied ways and means of heroism  both intentional and unintended, and Tolkien's examination of sacrifice and heroism is as inspiring as it is subtle. Amazingly, it all comes through in the films.Even more than the previous two films, Jackson and his writers took liberties with the story-line. Like the others, however, this serves the film better than simple adaptation from one medium to another. By reordering some of the chronology and adding scenes and plot devices which are consistent with Tolkien's world and characterizations, the film-makers actually do a better job of preserving the concepts and themes of the story than they could have with a pure adaptation. The lengthy epilogue in Tolkien's book is greatly reduced, reordered, and somewhat changed in order to work in the film. Some parts actually appear very early in ROTK. And some aspects of Tolkien's epilogue are disclosed in the Two Towers, though not directly depicted. But all of the really important components of the epilogue are, at least strongly implied if not well illustrated in ROTK.",10,105,132,30 November 2007
The Truman Show," Cinemetaphysical!
","You may not like it, but you have to respect it.Brilliant, thoughtful director Peter Weir (The Last Wave AKA Black Rain, Picnic at Hanging Rock, Master and Commander, Gallipoli, Dead Poets Society, Fearless and many others) teams up with excellent screenwriter Andrew Niccol and a great cast to give us a science fiction film with a range of emotions exceedingly rare for big budget mainstream cinema. In addition to the really disturbing questions the film raises about the nature of reality, metaphysics, religion, entertainment, human cruelty, voyeurism, and the concept of freedom, the film also offers a glimpse of humanity simultaneously occupying its worst and best aspects.The cast is phenomenally good. Carrey gives Truman the life his rich and sympathetic character he deserves - providing some of the most disturbing comedy I have ever witnessed. Tasha McElhone, Ed Harris, Peter Krause and Laura Linney are all excellent - though you may end up hating most of them for various reasons as the film progresses.Truman's entire life, from his birth onward has been one long TV show. He is literally being broadcast 24/7/365 and he knows nothing of it. His mom, wife, best friend, and everybody around him are all cast members. And the show is shot in a giant set which simulates an island. Because of a traumatic experience with the sea during his childhood, Truman does not feel free to travel away from his island home.Yet Truman is oddly compelled to explore the world and has begun to suspect that something is very wrong. Meanwhile, in what we like to think of as the REAL WORLD, everybody is watching him. People stay home from work to participate vicariously in his life in hopes that they will somehow catch a clue to 'how it will end.' This film is pretty heavy. You might find it amusing the first time you watch it, but once you've allowed it to exhaust you a few times, all that is left is the superb craft and the intense and disturbing ideas it constantly bombards you with. The film has a dark side and a hopeful, light (but never airy) side which - amazingly - is exposed concurrently with the heavy stuff.The cinematography is as picture-perfect as most of the work Weir is associated with. The acting is remarkably good all around, with those mentioned above in the outstanding roles. Sound is usually a very important component of Weir's films, but it's a little underexploited in the Truman Show - perhaps to (sometimes with painful force) draw the audience's attention to the profoundly insane dialog.The Truman Show is plot heavy, heavy, a little funny, and profoundly smart. Do not see it under the influence of anything detrimental to your mind or emotional balance......FLEX YOUR HEAD.",9,8,12,12 September 2007
300," Somewhat entertaining folkloric celebration of the ongoing war against tyranny featuring animated Greek statues
","The 300 is an entertaining CGI and live action bloodbath with a lot of good messages which are, unfortunately couched in an endless stream of clichés. The script is, however, its weakest point, and is actually somewhat superfluous.What you will take away from this film is really up to you. If you choose to be offended by ancient Spartan morality because it runs against your contemporary concerns, that's your choice. If you choose to see this as patriotic or nationalistic glorification of the military and organized, sanctioned murder - well perhaps that says more about you than it does about this film. If you choose to see it as an example of the potential of people who believe in themselves and in the value of their own lives because of a sense of freedom or a delusion of freedom, is, again, your choice. If you believe that bringing up embarrassing moments in a culture's heritage or telling a story from only one side (i.e. the side we know about) is unfair, well, then you should avoid history and stick with fantasy.Interpret as you wish - the basics of this story - including the motives of Leonides and others - are true to the history that has been passed down. It should be no surprise that racism, nationalism, homophobia and other unfortunate and irrational cultural notions have a deep lineage in human heritage. To argue that films should not attempt to depict these things would be to deny their existence - and would do nothing to fight against them. The 300 recounts a piece of ancient Greek history, as retold (and greatly embellished) by thousands of generations of Europeans - most recently Frank Miller in a graphic novel. I do not wish to take anything away from this story. It really is a great one. Three hundred Spartans and Arcadians really did take on several hundred thousand Persians from Xerxes armies in 480 BC at Thermopylae. And they really did scare the hell out of the Persians. Of course, most of the details depicted in this version of the story (and there have been many films about this battle before),are made up.The film succeeds in making visible the main points - both metaphorical and philosophical, that must be taken away from the mythic story of the defense of Thermopylae. The Spartan level of defiance, commitment to the value of their lives over and above their lives themselves, Greek views of Xerxes and the Persians (source of much folklore) and the tremendous debt Sparta accrued from the rest of Greece.The excellent visuals - which include exaggerated deformities, African animals trussed up to appear as demonic monsters, and a variety of other bent truths - really bring home the mythic quality of the story (this is incidentally characteristic of Miller's art as well),and well suggest how many of the Greeks actually viewed the wonders of Xerxes vast host.The acting is good for what it is - a simple, very violent and graphic tale. The directing is OK, but the detailed, beautifully choreographed fight scenes (which take up about half of the screen time) use the same mixture of greatly detailed slow motion cuts and fast-paced close-in chaos that has become a Hollywood war film cliché in recent times. Although I have criticized the script as the worst element of this film, speaking is really only important in about 15 total minutes within the film. It is worth listening to every scene with Xerxes in it, the conversations between Leonides and Laerthes and Leonides and his captain, and Gorgo's speech in the senate chamber. Otherwise, the soundscape is mostly worthwhile only for the audio components of the battle. The musical component of the soundtrack is mostly good, but occasionally utilizes an inappropriate and frankly silly hard rock instrumentation.Bottom line - if you enjoy action films featuring graphic violence and a lot of ripped guys dancing with swords, spears and shields, this is the film for you. If you want to get a general sense of the battle of Thermopylae, this is a good choice (however, don't think of it as a substitute for reading you textbook on ancient Greece). If you're looking for a great, realistic, war film this is pretty far off that mark and you might want to look into We Were Soldiers or The Great Escape instead.This review was written by a professional archaeologist",6,47,94,1 May 2007
Fantastic Four," Adequate Fan Film
","I loved the Fantastic Four Comic Book as a kid, but I never felt that their origin story really measured up to many of Marvel's Silver Age origins. So, I was a little surprised when I started seeing trailers for this film and it became apparent that the Fantastic Four would follow the origin-story formula for the franchise's first film. I was also a little concerned, and approached the film with low expectations. The film exceeded my expectations, but just barely. It was entertaining, though surprisingly violent considering that the original comic upon which it was based was more in the line of traditional pre-teen/teen oriented fiction than, for example, the X-Men.Four astronauts working with a somewhat shady ex-colleague in a private experimental venture are exposed to a radioactive cosmic storm which causes each of them to have different mutagenic reactions. Reed Richards become capable of morphing himself into virtually any shape and seemingly indestructible. Ben Grimm becomes rock-hard and incredibly strong. Johnny Blaze develops the ability to control flame and fly, and Susan Storm becomes telekinetic, and can rearrange air molecules to become invisible and to project a shield around herself and others. The storm also has an effect on Susan Storm's boss and boyfriend - the shady ex-colleague - affecting both his business credibility and his body, but to discuss this further would involve a spoiler.The film depicts the origin and personalities of the Fantastic Four in a manner which is fairly consistent with the Marvel Comic. I was particularly pleased with the casting and writing for Ben Grimm, who is, in my opinion, the most sympathetic of the group. The second half of the film shows them discovering what they can do with their new powers and sets up the emotional turmoil which will characterize the relationships between the four and their adversaries throughout many of their adventures - doing a particularly nice job of depicting Ben's feelings of loss and his reasons for them. The directing is fine, and the special effects are about as good as they could be (though they literally stretch believability quite often).The talented Mark Frost headed the writing team, which helps to explain why the dialog, pace and plotting were consistently above WGA's usual performance.All considered, the film does a reasonably good job within the limitations of the original material, which are several. Part of the problem with this material is that it fails to develop a main plot - in the form of a major adversarial relationship - until about 3/4ths of the way through the film. And that main plot is, therefore, subordinated to origin stories and characterization. How the franchise does will, therefore, largely depend on how effectively it uses the characterization in the first film to devise stronger plot devices in the succeeding films.I have greater trepidations about the second film - mainly because it involves one of Marvel's greatest story lines, and I have not, therefore, rushed to see the Silver Surfer. With the origin story out of the way and the characters built, and great material to work with, the second film ought to be an improvement.",6,2,4,6 December 2007
Sin City," Miller's art realized in fast paced nice film noir tribute.
","I'll put my bottom line at the top so you can decide whether to read on. I can't recommend this film to the average cinema-goer. Instead, I will recommend it to those who are fans of Frank Miller, film noir, Robert Rodrigues, and to a lesser extent Quentin Tarantino. This is also not a film for feminists. Others should read on and decide if this is something they want to see. The fact that Frank Miller was listed with Robert Rodriquez as co-director of this film, and the cleverly ambiguous film noir trailer hooked me. So, the spouse and I went to see it shortly after release, expecting exactly what we got - a very cleverly and interestingly shot film noir version of several Frank Miller stories taking place in Basin City, the locus of Miller's graphic novels of the same name as the film. Quentin Tarantino guest directs one of the segments. I'm not sure which - Rodrigues' style is as often violent, but a bit more comic. Based on some of the ridiculous violence of the film, I think it likely that QT had some influence on the other segments as well. My only objection to this film is really the quantity of absurd and frankly grotesque violence scenes. Though the violence is true to Miller's work, seeing it as a process creates a very different effect than Miller's art. Fortunately, Rodrigues' sense of humor also prevails in most of the most violent scenes. The use of colorization emphasizes the film's bloodiness through the only colors used in the film - red, ultra-white and yellow - comic exaggeration and a wonderfully eerie noir feel. Predictably, this is a very dark film, and quite a bit more disturbing than the average commercial stuff. What the spouse and I didn't expect was pleasantly surprising - one of the most artistically well done interpretations of the comic medium I have yet seen (and I have seen them all) and stand-out performances by Del Toro, Mickey Rourke and Willis. I expect nothing less from Del Toro, but I have to admit Rourke just blew me away as Miller's phenomenally ugly and invincible tough guy - Marv - who decides, for once, to do something good with his life. Rourke's character is played with such empathy that you won't want his segments to end - you will want him to become the final hero of the film. I was less enchanted with Clive Owen's portrayal of Dwight. Though this segment was good entertainment, I thought Owen could have given a more emotive performance. Elijah Wood was exceptionally creepy and well cast in his very brief role.All of the heroic male characters (and this film is VERY much filmed from a stereotype film noir male point of view) have one common characteristic - they are all very tough critters fighting against all odds against endemic corruption, murder and injustice, but not at all afraid to indulge in it to further their own ends. The vignettes are loosely but satisfactorily connected. But the plots are less important than the way the film FEELS. The film mixes hopelessness with fearlessness and fatalism to the extent that you'll feel like an honorable death ending a brief life is far more appealing than a lengthy life devoid of self-respect. It's a really well done homage to Comic Book as an art form, and the film noir motif. Whoever thought of putting Rodriguez and Miller together on this one deserves a nod from fans of both genres.",7,156,259,18 June 2005
Donnie Darko," compelling, eerie, intense, haunting, evocative, potent, sad, heroic
","Being an angst-ridden teenager has never been easy, especially when you can see what's down the road, and it looks a lot like the end of your world.Writer and Director Richard Kelly is an artist whose films I will anticipate and Jake Gyllenhaal is truly remarkable among a very rich cast. He plays a troubled young man with a brilliant intellect and a vast imagination, struggling with the boredom of standard education, and a society afraid of its own shadow (e.g. contemporary America). An imaginary friend, Frank - a seven foot tall metal-headed skull-faced demon-rabbit saves his life by removing him from the the scene of a catastrophe just before it occurs, only to lead him down an alternative path to an even more terrible oblivion complete with forecasts of doom, psychiatrists, and self-help charlatans.This film feels as creepy as any well-made ghost story I have ever seen, yet redefines the genre of supernatural storytelling in a very unique and original way.Donnie Darko is a film about heroism and sacrifice, decorated with disturbing imagery, the horror of everyday life, and a soundtrack reminiscent of Lynch's best. It is also a film worthy of several viewings and at least as many varied interpretations. I can not honestly recommend this to anybody who attends films for the pure sake of entertainment. Nor can I recommend it to people who need straight answers or have limited attention spans. It's art, and does not need to provide pat explanations for itself. As entertaining as this film may be, it has an unrelenting and merciless dark side, and might disturb even the most veteran indy film carmudgeon.This is a great film. See it.",9,387,539,22 April 2005
Cinderella Man," Very little to say...
","My heart was firmly lodged in my throat for the last hour and a half of The Cinderella Man. Nobody does true-story heroism like Ron Howard, and few can do heroes like Russell Crowe. Though Howard fictionalizes his subjects, and does not pretend to make documentaries, he does accurately depict the feeling and the major points of his subjects. Jim Braddock was a depression-era boxer who everybody thought was down for the count. Though there is a lot of boxing in this film, this is not a boxing movie, but rather his story and the story of the family that inspired him to fight back against prejudice and hopelessness, to rise to heights that would inspire a nation. Braddock is portrayed in a moving and powerful manner, with remarkable performances all around, one of the best scripts I can remember in recent years, and occasionally brutal action.Those who have run into my reviews may note that this is one of my shortest. Please understand that I really don't think there's much to say about this simple, beautiful and very human story, besides - see it!",10,228,297,4 June 2005
The Simpsons Movie," Entertaining - and a bit more adult than the show
","I have seen the long-lived TV show only a few times a year since it began, but I've always found it amusing (if not worth tuning in for). I am also not a big fan of comedy. So, needless to say my expectations were not very high when I went to see this with some friends tonight.The film surpassed my expectations, as the show usually does. The characterization is consistent with the series and the Addams family of the '90s is just as lovably screwed up as they have always been.The central problem this time is that, partly due to Homer's behavior, the levels of pollution in Springfield are so high that the EPA quarantines the entire town. A lynch mob goes after the family, but they escape to Alaska to start a new life. The plot set-up is also cleverly connected to religious superstitions and mass-paranoia. This takes us about half an hour or maybe a little further into the film.There are plenty of relatively smart jokes (compared to the average Will Ferrell flick), with some satirical political overtones, and a bit of risqué humor as well.I recommend The Simpsons Movie to fans of the show, and friends of fans. While I don't really think the film is entirely appropriate for young kids, it should be fine for most of the family (teen plus).",7,6,10,25 August 2007
Dodgeball," Fun piece of camp comedy
","What's funny about dodgeball? First, it's a movie about a group of non-competitive and somewhat eccentric adults playing dodgeball to save a not-very-impressive gym from the clutches of a competitive monopolistic chain gym. Second - Ben Stiller. Stiller is over-the-top and hilarious as the evil nemesis of average Joe Vince Vaughn. Vaughn - playing the slightly less than average Joe owner of Average Joe's gym, plays the perennial hard luck loser to the hilt. The supporting cast is terrific. Alan Tudyk, Rip Torn, Christine Taylor and Stephen Root are a great ensemble.This is a rather extreme and rather Hollywood camp comedy. Although a lot of the humor is adult, the film is also refreshingly clean compared with the averaged 21st century comedy. Dodgeball also doubles as a spot-the-cameo film, since a whole host of odd celebrities pop up here and there throughout.The first time I saw this film, I was charmed and I laughed a lot. Although the film remained entertaining, like most comedies it lost a bit of its luster in its second viewing.Why only a 6 rating? Despite the campiness and good solid humor, this is still a very formulaic film and it does tend to vaporize after a viewing or two.Strongly recommended - for one viewing!",6,32,55,19 December 2005
V for Vendetta," Entertaining and intelligent
","V for Vendetta is an adaptation of a graphic novel by Alan Moore. While V can be seen as an action film, it's much more. Although set in Britain, and originally conceived and written by a British artist, this film seems designed to speak to American political sensibilities. V probes the purpose of government and brings up themes which contemporary Americans seem to have forgotten - the basic concepts of the separation of church and state, government by and for the people, the right to overthrow leaders who exercise their own will at the expense of the nation. V reminds us of our duty to resist and rebel against megalomania and totalitarianism. Though grown in England, and tapped into English history, the message applies everywhere and to everybody, but seems especially appropriate for those of us living with the Bush administration and fearful of its legacy.Natalie Portman plays a young woman who is afraid of her own shadow. Out after curfew one night, she is approached by a pair of ruffians and rescued by the verbose, masked V (Weaving). V is a man who has lost his identity as a result of events in his past which are mysteriously connected to the fascistic government (presided over by John Hurt). He draws his identity out of a relatively obscure event in British history, an attempt to blow up parliament, and dons a mask which is a caricature of the leader of this gunpowder revolution.The plot and characterizations are complex, with adequate but not overbearing back-story. The script is occasionally goofy but excellent - retaining many elements of the comic medium without losing any credibility. The acting is simply wonderful. Natalie Portman is phenomenal. Weaving carries a difficult role very nicely, giving powerful humanity to a man who remains shrouded in mystery. Stephen Rea and John Hurt - always great - both lend strong support. The cinematography is very good and fits the story nicely.Since this film involved the Wachowski's many have seen fit to compare it to the Matrix. Although there are some similarities, I think the comparison is unfair to both films. V is a much less subtle and, in a purely practical political way, a more intelligent and less playful film. It is also less cinematographically innovative and less reliant on scope. Where The Matrix unfolded in the playground of ontology, V is firmly situated in the gladiatorial arena of social psychology. Besides, V was directed by James McTeigue, not the Wachowskis.Even if you don't get it from a political point of view, you are very likely to enjoy this film. I recommend it to all free-thinking individuals who have not lost hope for humanity.",9,30,59,9 August 2006
The Island," Just a little better than pretty good, but also just a little unoriginal
","Michael Bay has had his directoral ups and downs, but here in the big budget action realm, the director of the excellent The Rock seems right at home. This time, Bay welds the action to a solid, if somewhat unoriginal sci fi plot - which blends elements of Logan's Run, THX-1138 and Gattaca.Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johanson are an attractive couple living in a completely medically regulated community designed to repopulate a world decimated by a mass extinction. Ethan Phillips, Djimon Hounsou and Sean Beam all provide excellent support. Beam is miraculously transformed into his clever, arrogant and suspect character. Phillips is also particularly memorable as their slightly unhinged pal.Life in an enclosed, sterile environment, with all of their needs taken careof - including neatly arranged and identical uniforms, jobs, and three square can be a great bore, so - once a week or so - the sponsoring corporation gives away a one way ticket to the only place in the outside world which isn't lethal - The Island.McGregor's Licoln Six Echo and a number of his cohorts are becoming increasingly agitated and curious about their home. All the while, his platonic relationship with Jordan Two Delta (Johanson) grows. But then, she wins her ticket to the island.I have described the basic set up, and sci-fi fans will probably understand that this film actually sits among Logan's Run, gattaca, THX-1138 and other intelligent dystopian sci films. What may be a little harder to visualize is how stylistically indebted to Gattaca and THX-1138 this film is. Ewan McGregor doesn't really look like Ethan Hawke, and Scarlett Johanson is certainly not easily mistaken for Uma Thurmond, but between the cinematography, the themes, and the overall prettiness of the cast, the homage is obvious. The camera work is excellent, and the pace is spot-on, though it does become a little breathless toward the end.Nevertheless, The Island stands on its own as a nice example of big budget sci fi which does not insult its audience's intelligence and uses its budget to tell an interesting story - not just to show off a lot of special effects and highly improbable action (though there is quite a lot of both here anyway). Recommended for serious and semi-serious sci fi fans.",7,30,42,20 March 2007
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Dumb but entertaining racing comedy
","In Talladega Nights, Will Farrell and Jon C. Reilly head a nicely assembled cast (without a lot of star power) in a story about a fool who happens to be a race car driver and who has based his entire life philosophy around a phrase uttered by his alcoholic father during a drunk - 'If you ain't first, you're last'. Ricky Bobby rides high in his largely unexamined life until, predictably, he eventually crashes hard when confronted with a gay French intellectual who just might be a better driver than he is, and a boss who does not appreciate his arrogance.Talladega Nights uses a narrative and editing style reminiscent of the brilliant Deathrace 2000 to create an entirely different effect - unlike Deathrace 2000's intellectually challenging political and social commentary, Talladega Nights is a simple absurdist comedy played out by several stereotypes in the contemporary racing entertainment industry. The film is successful largely because of it's careful plotting and occasional substitution of slap-stick for (dumb) dialogue driven comedy. The script is nothing special, but was probably well edited in the final construction of the film in order to emphasize its occasional moments of brilliance. If you go into this without much in the way of expectations, you just might enjoy it.",6,28,48,7 January 2007
