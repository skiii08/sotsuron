Marie Antoinette," It needed a little more story
","If you decide to go see this movie I would recommend that you know a little bit about Queen Marie Antoinette before hand. When I went most people did not know that her and the King were killed during the French Revolution. The producers and writers should have added some more history background so people aren't disappointed with the story. The movie was really based on the costumes and props not the historical story of this royal family. I think I would have enjoyed the movie more if they would have put more about the beginnings of the revolution. It is not the worst movie I have ever seen however, it was not the best either. For history buffs, those interested in the story and not the costumes, do not go and pay money to see it. On the other hands, those who like out of this world costumes it might be worth the money. I would not take back my experience with this movie, but I will not be seeing it again or buying it when it comes out on DVD. Good luck in making your choice to go see the movie or not.",4,0,0,21 October 2006
