Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Really bad and awful.
","Before watching it, i thought i'd be funny and cool. But now i am disappointed. Undoubtedly it has funny moments. But most of the jokes are extremely stupid and some others kinda annoying. It looks like a low-profit movie, who was made without planing and without detailing it. The acting is non-sense since the very beginning. One thing is to supposedly come from Kazakh, and other to act irrationally and saying dumb things to every person you meet. Well, this is what this movie is like. A dumb acted movie, with silly jokes. I'm sure most of the people who have watched it will agree with me. I'm glad i watched 'Borat' just because now i know how bad it is. Really there are many other (and better) movies you can watch.",1,7,14,17 January 2007
The Holiday," nice history, nice actors, nice movie.
","This movie rocks!!, it has an excellent storyline full of comedy. The four starring characters do an amazing job. People who like comedy and romance movies will love this one. The only bad thing about it is that there are some small parts of the movie that can be a little boring because of the long talk it has. But in general the movie is great. And has a realistic, and credible dialogs between characters. Definitely you can not miss this movie, is unique and hilarious. There are only some few movies, at least for me, that reach the level of this one. The Holiday is the one of best options to watch in any occasion, and be sure that won't make you drowsy or bored. Of course all of this is because of the work of Nancy Meyers, who has also directed films like Something's Gotta Give, What Women Want and Parent Trap. There is no excuse for not watching it.",9,0,1,17 January 2007
