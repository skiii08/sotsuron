Skyfall," So bitterly disappointed, like Swordfish but not as good
","I could witter on for hours about this! I knew Skyfall movie was being hyped stupidly but nothing could prepare me for this sort of disappointment. I loved Casino Royale and like most Bond fans I was dismayed with QoS but for me Skfall is even worse. Trying to do this concisely...BAD: Opening chase scene from the midpoint - too drawn out removing any suspense = boring. The new Moneypenny, Naomie Harris = wooden as a tree trunk. Wafer thin plot. Zero suspense. Bardem woefully underused. Bardem's silly hairdo. Craig's stupidly tight suit.s Appallingly obvious stuntman in rooftop bike chase scene. Skyfall Lodge is one of the worst sets I have seen in any movie ever. To say it looked like a TV soap opera set would be a complement, it was really really obvious it was a plaster set ready to be blown up! Fake fog at Skyfall Silly final scenes with everyone stumbling around in the fake fog for what seemed like ages. Entry of the helicopter with music just overplayed and ill conceived. Complete lack of understanding of IT and UI's Q's silly glasses and the geekyness just didn't work for me - miscast. Worst of all for any Bond movie is the total lack of glamour and escapism. If you cannot escape whilst watching a Bond movie then things must be bad right?! Some very bad sets generally. Poor continuity - Keep an eye on M's handbag...Reintroduction of the DB5 was embarrassing and there is no way Bond would leave it for ages in a dusty old garage in London and to go back and find it immaculate. Just not well done at all.GOOD: Berenice Marlohe was incredible in her portrayal of a terrified baddie's woman, one of the real highlights of Skyfall. Opening chase really good, digger on the train especially.y The yacht going to the bombed island was a tiny piece of much need glamour so so missing in Skyfall. Death of 'M' has to be a good thing and it was quite well done Craig did his best to save this movie even in the Norman Wisdom suits! Final scene with Bond looking over the rooftops of London was great albeit a homage to dark knight looking over Gotham cit.yAll in all a very weird movie and no amount of positive reviews will make me think otherwise",1,16,33,11 November 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Best film
","The Two Towers is without doubt this year's best film. The errors are very small and the achievements very major, in particular the most creative and memorable CGI ever. Makes Harry Potter 2 look like a poor TV show from ten years ago. This is the sort of film you can watch twice in the first week and still come out wanting more.",9,0,0,22 December 2002
