Alien 3," A Very Under-Rated Movie
",*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*Alien 3 is the most under-rated movie of the alien series. Director David Fincher gives it an amazing look with his vision. The effects are great and this movie returns to the themes that made us all fall in love with the first one. The rush that this movie gives you is incredible. The chestbuster scene with the dog looks amazing as does the chestbuster scene with Riply. Overall a great movie. 8/10,7,1,3,16 January 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Has Lucas lost his touch?
",I saw Star Wars: Episode II - Attack At The Clones at the midnight screening...and wasted my money. For a big budget movie like this you would have thought Lucas the creator of one of the best Sci-Fi movies in history could have come up with a better plot and graphics. The clone troopers look crap.Why did Lucas go for a romantic side to Star Wars? It screwed it up. While the actors did a great performance this movie just doesn't fit in with the original films. Lucas needs to get back on track and make Episode III a hell of a lot better if he expects me and I'm sure many other people satisfied.,6,0,1,16 May 2003
Aliens," A Damn Good Movie...
","57 years after Ripley's encounter with the Alien she is rescued by a salvage team and then gets her pilot licence suspended, only to find out that LV-426 has been colonized by people, and that they have lost contact.That's when the marines come in to kick some Xenomorph butt. They go to LV-426 only to find out the Xenomorphs have found there way to the humans. However, they soon figure out that there has to be one egg for each host...'So that's over 200 eggs.' (Ripley) 'That's right' (Bishop ) 'So who's laying these eggs?' (Ripley).An excellent movie with great visual FX and great storyline and cast. Altogether one of the better sci-fi movies of the age.'Game over man. Game over.' (Hudson)",9,0,1,1 September 2003
Batman Begins," Batman Begins...again
","After being invited to the premier at the local cinema I jumped at the opportunity. I was expecting big things, and well I wasn't disappointed. The movie is paced very well and I believe that Christian Bale is the best Batman yet. He manages to be believable as the Dark Knight and Bruce Wayne. While yes there are a few corny one-liners, the film holds together well. The action scenes are great, especially the first time Batman goes out on the town. It brought back memories of the old horror movies, when the characters get picked of one-by-one. The film does have humor, and most of it coming from Michael Cains' character. The twist at the end is golden. I never saw it coming and I managed to pick the twist in both The Sixth Sense and The Village. Christopher Nolan has shown us what he is capable of, now let us hope that Bryan Singer can do the same with Superman and bring new life to the movies.A+",9,7,11,16 June 2005
The Matrix Reloaded," Is it just me or was The Matrix Reloaded crap
","Why is it that nearly all sequels suck. I personally thought this movie sucked. Not only were the graphics bad but the story line was crap to. I saw it with 4 of my friends and they all agree it sucked. While there might have been more explosions, this movie just doesn't come close to The Matrix, which I think everyone will agree was a work of art. I'm just praying that The Matrix Revolutions is a hell of a lot better. The Wachowski should be ashamed for the fact that they have ruined a great movie.",7,0,0,16 May 2003
Speed," An Enjoyable Film
","The best way to sum up this movie is to quote the great Homer Simpson...'I saw this movie about a bus that had to speed around a city keeping its speed over 50 because if its speed dropped below it the bus would explode...I think it was called 'The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down'This is Reeve's best non-matrix film to date and Sandra Bullocks tip of her career. Jan de Bont does a great job directing and the opening scene is brilliant.This movie has a good balance of humor, action and sex related topics to make the movie even more enjoyable.This film is also much better than Speed 2 which was just stupid, and for people who say there should be a Speed 3...please don't give 20th Century Fox any ideas!!!!!",Null,0,0,1 September 2003
