Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This movie is painful to watch
","I'm a fan of the Star Wars saga, episodes 4-6, probably more than the average film buff. The argument that critics of this movie are lacking in objectivity seems to make sense, but is actually totally false. I so very much wanted to like this movie...I begged my brain to like this movie. There are simply too many problems, however, that I cannot forgive. The acting is wooden, the script is absurd, the dialogue unintentionally hilarious, and the cast is wasted. Anakin Skywalker as a virgin birth? Criminy. Jar Jar Binks is the most annoying character in film history. Mr. Lucas, to get a refresher course on how to create an epic masterpiece, see Lord of the Rings...many times.",1,1,3,18 August 2003
