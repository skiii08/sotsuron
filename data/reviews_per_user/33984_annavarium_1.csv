Blade Runner 2049," Better when Harrison...
","Well the movie improved when Harrison finally appeared. My question is, was the ghost of Kubrick directing? Nothing wrong with that, for the right material, but this 'sequel' has a completely different 'energy' from the first. Visually stunning, beautiful, and so on and so forth, but missing the energy and drive of the first movie, and sadly not what we were expecting for a Blade Runner movie.",2,1,3,28 December 2017
