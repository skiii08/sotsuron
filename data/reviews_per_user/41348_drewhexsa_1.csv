Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Hilarious Comedy Doubles As Social Commentary.
","Borat is best comedy to come out in many years, due to it's unabashed delivery of jokes alongside people who are not in on the joke at all. While on the surface is a sexist, anti-semitic reporter from Kazakhstan, the responses people give to his fake questions show just how ignorant and backwards some of our fellow citizens are. A combination of Mockumentary/Reality Show/Expose, Borat travels from New York to Los Angeles in search of the American Dream, which according to him equals having sex with Pamela Anderson. The truths it exposes are only in part due with Borat as his behavior causes some of the most honest, and yet shocking reactions from the heart of America. This movie is highly recommended for anyone with intelligence and a sense of humor, but beware America, the joke is on you.",10,1,15,6 November 2006
