The Monuments Men," Message for Clooney:
","Yo George, Next time you're pretending to be an American Military Officer (or an enlisted man, for that matter) don't walk around with your hands in your pockets... No self-respecting Military Man would get caught dead walking around with his hands in his pockets...It's sad that you don't seem to already know that, but I get it, you've lived a life of privilege which doesn't include serving your country to try to give back for all it has given you...Shape up for the next time, or be a brat, whatever's your choice, I don't care...God Bless, BudPS - Yes, it affected my enjoyment of the movie negatively...",6,0,0,10 October 2014
Forrest Gump," A Quick 2 Cents:
","I give it a 10 out of 10 because it is in my Top 100 Movies of all time (Top 10, actually), and because when I run across it on TV I can't help but watch whatever is left of it time-wise... I must have done that 25 or 50 times, and probably always will... I think that's what you do when you like a movie over most others...A bunch of years have now gone by since I saw 'Forrest Gump' the first time - in a theater, and when I try to think of movies I'd prefer to re-watch I have a hard time coming up with 10, some days it's only 2 or 3... Then again I've been told I'm a sentimental old fool...The only reason I am here writing this considering 20 years have gone by since the debut is that I bumped into someone recently who hasn't seen this film, and I thought maybe something I might say could possibly persuade a similar person to go rent it... It would be hard to find a better way to spend 2 and a half hours...",10,1,1,16 October 2014
Gone Girl," Didn't like the Ending...
","I really doubt I'm going to 'write a spoiler' here, but I checked the box simply to protect myself... The fact is the story line was predictable for quite some time, but I don't see that as a problem - the story was still good, and I enjoyed the film until the ending developed...When it was over I was bummed... I thought it took to long to get to an ending I find horridly disagreeable, but that's just me - you might love it... The Missus didn't like the end either, and in fact agreed with me that the movie was a good 20 minutes too long...We both settled on an ending we felt was far better, and more 'realistic'(?) - not sure that's the right word for it - didn't want to say 'predictable', maybe 'logical' would work better...There's a lot to like about this movie, if you've read this, so don't let me stop you from seeing it... I gave it an '8' out of '10' in an effort to be fair, and also to show that I was OK with it, or at least 80% of it... That is often as good as it gets in the movie biz...",8,2,9,14 October 2014
Pitch Perfect 2," Not all that good, Still Impressive in its own way...
","Hard to believe... Took The Missus to see this movie yesterday 'knowing' I probably would hate it... Didn't hate it, although it was torturous and tortuous at the same time, but that's probably because despite all the decent to good looking broads in it the movie is on the one hand a disaster, but on the other must have rivaled 'D-Day' for the amount of planning, effort and work that had to have gone into the making of this film - which very well may have been the most complicated movie to make of all time... Then again, what do I know??I recommend the guys take their women to see it, but sneak out 5 minutes after it starts - she'll never notice... There has got to be something better to do while she's in there...",7,4,10,3 June 2015
