Iron Man 3," Oh. Dear. God
","IMDb - Long time follower - first time review.I watched Iron Man 3 last night and as I sat down in the plush leather seats of the largest cinema Melbourne had to offer, I was feeling a tingle of excitement. Following the Avengers I was amping for some cross-movie character goodness, not to mention seeing Iron Man battle it out against the Mandarin.Things started out semi OK. The Mandarin was sending out terrorist threats at a fast pace - these threats mimicking real world philosophies and politics (clever, I thought). Then it got to about halfway through the film and I was wondering 'when is something going to actually happen?', or more importantly 'when is Ironman going to do something cool - like he did in the first film when a tank fired at him, he dodged it, sent a tiny projectile in return and then turned his back and started walking away with the knowledge already that the tanks ass was grass, and he just mowed it'. Come on, that scene was dope.Instead we get Pepper Pots - who once was a PA in a short skirt, now discussing weaponisable genetic therapies with a greasy businessman. (What are her credentials?). We get a dude that blows up half of Hollywood because he gets too hot. Why he gets too hot is not explained (yes I realise it is because of this extremis project - but why they have the power of lava inside them is beyond me. I thought it was meant to be for regeneration???). We get Tony stark making a mockery of why he is even Ironman, because he can just control the suits from any desirable location. Does this not destroy the whole idea of Ironman? We also get the Ironman suit falling apart in nearly every scene. I thought the suit was capable of more than this, and surely if you have 50 suits then you must be unstoppable - even by superhero standards. We get a laughable joke of the Mandarin. A lot of people have already commented on this so I wont proceed further. And finally we get every god damn person being able to control the suit almost willy nilly. It took Stark ages in the first film to tweak the suit and train in it, then all of a sudden, Pepper Pots and bloody Guy Pearce can fly around and crash to the earth, knee first no less, as if it was as simple as operating an iPod. As for Guy Pearce breathing fire - I literally cried.My head was in my hands at the end of it. Where was Thor, or Cap or even Hawkeye - someone from Avengers that could even stop by and help for a second before explaining they have their own s%*# to do. Wasn't this meant to be a phase two film taking into account the events of the Avengers? Actually - while we are on that - why didn't War Machine show up in the avengers, if only for a short while? They had aliens laying waste to New York City and where was he? Isn't he meant to be the Presidents' right hand man? The after credits scene summed up the movie entirely - lame and pointless. Everyone will go watch this film because this is how they are marketed, and unfortunately, the poor social state of the world just packs these theaters out with people too stupid to see the wood through the trees. Unfortunately, through sheer hope, I had become one of them. Well no longer! I was left with a foul taste at the end of TDKR, and after this my mouth is even fouler. These films need to be better. The Dark Knight was exceptional - why can this not be achieved elsewhere? They have the money for it, and any resource they can command.All in all, I would recommend not watching it - but who I am to stop the tidal wave of crap that is currently being produced.P.S. Dredd ruled. Hard hitting, true to the comics, gory. And that film bombed??? What is this world coming to?",3,3,7,4 May 2013
Suicide Squad," Wow, that was bad
","How did we come from 'The Dark Knight' released 8 years ago to this???? And, before I get heckled, I am 100% open to new takes on characters and story lines. Heck, if this revitalization of these franchises didn't occur, things would get stale pretty quickly.However, having just seen this, I am in complete disbelief as to how DC has managed to steer themselves this far downhill. This movie is miles away from the storytelling and character development that was on show in Nolans Superhero masterpiece.It started off OK - a fun and colorful take on character introduction, but it was clear that there were only two characters in this squad that this movie really wanted to focus on, namely the two big names headlining the film. Deadpool was portrayed well, though it would have been great to introduce him with a bit more of a showcase on his skills. I didn't like the whole Harley / Joker thing however. I think Margot Robbie was perfectly cast but the Joker was a big misfire for me. This surprised me, as going by the general gist of these reviews on IMDb, it seems that a lot of people actually liked this casting and the subsequent character interaction. Personally, I felt the Joker was a little too..... normal?; almost like a typical mobster with some makeup and hair dye. He didn't have that maniacal essence that Heath Ledger and even Jack Nicholson portrayed so effectively.Rounding out the other characters - Killer Croc was too small (why are they intent on reducing the size of these characters? - just like they did with Apocalypse in X-Men) and his impact was not menacing enough. Diablo was fine until the end - what the hell happened there! Slipknot was the sacrificial lamb as anyone who knew anything about Suicide Squad could tell from a mile away. Captain Boomerang has so much more potential than was shown, and I actually could tolerate Jai Courtenay, which amazed me. Rick Flag was terrible - Joel Kinnaman is a real hit and miss actor and at times in this he resembled a drug addict more than a super soldier. Kitana was a real background character, and her choreography in the film was terrible.However, all in all, it was the storytelling and the poor action that really let this film down. There was a need for characters to constantly remind each other what to do, just to keep the idea of the plot flowing. 'Harley! If he dies, we die'. The antagonists in both this film and BvS have turned this franchise too much towards a reliance on CG - something that done well can be game changing (as Marvel has shown), however this was not done well and does not do the movie any favors.I walked out of the film deflated. Batman v Superman had its OK parts, but this film was the nail in the coffin for DC as far as I am concerned. This saddens me deeply. Batman is my world. It is my screen name on Playstation and Boom Beach (to name but a few), and I have lived and breathed this character since I was a 5 year old stepping into Tim Burtons first take on the caped crusader. To see his 'house' collapsing around him is killing me. DC has to take a step back on this one and think what they are doing. This is not the way",4,5,10,9 August 2016
