Skyfall," Craig is the worst bond
","To be quite frank the only part of this film i liked was when bond was shot. Because (apparently) MGM has lost their mind. First of all, if they wanted a blond bond, Neil Patrick Harris would have been a much better choice. If a blond bond is acceptable, than Huston, we have aproblem! Craig resembles nothing but a common street bum. Hese got a bit too much attitude. The bond series was going fine until he took the job. (i myself prefer Rogor Moore) Daniel Craig is the most overrated actor in the history of the world. As for the film, we've got a black money penny, and a blond 007, oh yeah this is gonna be a great film!(if you haven't guessed by now that was sarcasm) I would have loved this film but there was one big flaw, bigger than the fact that we've got the most Unsexy bond in the history of films. It was the fact that there was no black whole thing where James bond came up to it and shot it. How anyone liked this film i will never know. 7 years ago when i watched casino royale i noticed all of this and everyone else there loved it. Well i stood up and said no! you cant do that, because James bond isn't a blond wimp! and that, is why Craig is the worst bond. Oh and p.s. anyone who thinks I'm wrong obviously didn't see the other James bonds. And that, is the cosmic perspective...",1,9,18,3 August 2013
We're the Millers," WTM?! (get it? instead of wtf...........OK i guess that wasn't that funny)
","Im so glad i get to see the rise of a truly great snl man, and the return of Jennifer Aniston (which i was very happy about). I love Jason and i hope he makes more movies this funny. This whole movie reminds me of 'vacation' (1983). Lets just hope there will be a sequel, 'We are the millers 2: revenge of the spider!' Crazy fun and insanely insane this movie will have you rolling in the isles. And you gotta expect it from one of the funniest man on the 21st century, i hope Jason will soon direct a film of his own. And that is why only one 3 word word can describe this movie: WTM?! (get it? instead of wtf...........OK i guess that wasn't that funny)Just please see this film you will love it! And im not just saying that its pretty funny.",10,8,29,7 August 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Completely inaccurate and a terrible film. Why i urge you to not waste your time and watch something else.
","This movie is the worst spider man anything ever made. It is Completely inaccurate and a terrible film. And here is Why i urge you to not waste your time and watch something else: )step number one: telling you all the flaws) First of all peter Parker has glasses and when he is bitten by the spider he no longer needs them. but in this film that is not the story. peter doesn't have them from the beginning which is a huge flaw! Also (no offense to Sally Field here, i think she is a wonderful actor and i think Anne Hathaway didn't deserve that Oscar at all) aunt may is not a brunet, I'm sure the only reason they made Sally Field take the job is because they wanted more people to see it. (step 2: criticism) Marc Webb obviously doesn't know the first thing about spider man, and for that i say for shame. if he didn't have the knowledge to make the film why didn't he just not make it? Hopefully the sequel will bomb, and I'm sure the only reason that anyone saw this film is because they were spider man fans, even i fell for Marc Webb's trick and watched it. And that, is why This is a Completely inaccurate and a terrible film. I urge you to not waste your time and watch something else.",1,1,15,7 August 2013
