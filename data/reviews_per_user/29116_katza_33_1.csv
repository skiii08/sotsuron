Black Swan," Disturbingly beautiful.
","When I saw that this film was on the cinema I asked a few of my friends who had seen it what they thought about it - the answers I got were 'weird, stupid, confusing and not worth watching.'They couldn't have been more wrong. This film just took my breath away. Wow! What an amazing movie, a masterpiece if you will. Everything about it just captured me, from the gorgeous dancing (I was never a fan of ballet but this was just brilliant) to the darkest moments in the film, such as the ending and everything in between.The cast, in my opinion, played their roles excellently. Especially Natalie Portman, who was absolutely amazing, she deserved every bit of the Oscar she won and you can see why in the movie. She just completely aced the role of Nina. I could go on praising her performance but words just can't do it justice... You simply must go and see it for yourself. Enjoy!",10,1,3,26 April 2011
