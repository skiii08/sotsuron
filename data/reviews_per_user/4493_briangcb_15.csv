Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Back to basics and a smart choice. Could it be studios are wising up?
","I will say that I am a fan of all the PotC movies, the second one is probably my favourite...but my reasons for liking sequels to action films or comic book movies is usually that while the first one is usually the best, it sets up the characters, they all meet, develop relationships, etc. so the second film leaves more room for action and advancing stories. Which is the case for PotC. The first one is definitely the best executed, but I enjoyed the second one for its action, effects, humour, etc. My complaints about Pirates 2 and 3 were that they became so complex and ridiculous that they were just wayyyy out there. I had no trouble following the plot but I couldn't help but think that younger audience members wouldn't know what the hell was going on at all. Also, in the first film we're not entirely sure if Jack Sparrow is trying to screw people over to secure his own gains, or if he's helping himself by helping others. It's clearly stated by the end of the film that he's actually a good man. Yet in Pirates 2 and 3 he's blatantly trying to screw people over who had helped save him previously.So when I heard that a fourth pirates movie was in production, I wasn't thrilled. My main thought was 'Whatever, we'll see.' Once it was released I decided to go see it at the theatre and I was pleasantly surprised. The plot was straightforward, they're trying to find the fountain of youth and they list the steps needed to complete this. Jack is back to being the honestly dishonest (honestly) pirate we all came to love. There are mermaids, zombies (sort of) and of course the fountain of youth. But the plot never gets too complicated or completely ridiculous. My complaint about the film was the main villain Blackbeard wasn't fleshed out enough. He shows up fairly late into the film and he's never really shown to be the scariest pirate to sail the sea. Davy Jones and his crew were much more menacing.All in all, if the series continues with this pattern of keeping the movies simple and fun then I'm all for more of them being made.",Null,6,8,28 May 2011
Knowing," I owe Nicolas Cage an apology...sort of.
","I saw the trailers for this movie and I thought it looked intriguing...until I saw Nicolas Cage was in it. Then it automatically looked like it was going to suck.Now I'm not a pure hater, I used to really like him back in the late 90's...The Rock, Con Air, etc. But around the time Windtalkers came out...I found him to just really project this ego of 'I'm the greatest actor I don't even need to act.' which continued for every film he was in that I could bear to watch after that. It got to the point where just seeing his face in a movie got to be enough to kill my interest in seeing that movie. I saw this movie for cheap at the video store so I decided to pick it up. I figured what the hell, should at least have some good special effects.Boy am I disappointed I didn't see this at the theatre. It was excellent, there were quite a few layers to the movie, all around solid performances by the cast (Yes that includes Mr. Cage) great visuals, compelling characters, suspense, drama, emotion, dread, the list goes on. I was most impressed with the film being based on the Ancient Astronaut Theory of which I am fascinated by. And the film does it in a subtle but not 'this is fact' kind of way.So I definitely recommend this film to anyone, even if you don't like Nick Cage, it's worth a look.",Null,5,10,5 June 2011
Alien vs. Predator," someone who knows what they're talking about
","Please, if you don't understand a movie it means you don't pay attention. If you don't pay attention then your comment is not valid. I saw this movie and i did not find one single part confusing, if you had payed attention in the other predator movies it would make a lot more sense. Predators live by honor, the reason he didn't just snap Arnold's neck in the first movie is because he see's that he is a formidable opponent and wanted to face him in a hand to hand combat. When Danny Glover kills the predator in the second film the rest of them gather around him but let him live, and the leader gives him a trophy...it's all HONOR. That's why Alexa teams up with the predator in this movie, she kills an alien, and gives the predator his shoulder cannon. The movie also blatantly explains why the aliens and predators are in the temple...The Predators built the temple and used humans to breed the aliens, so that way the predators could hunt the aliens and gain their honor. Also Alexa teaming up with the predator is from the comic books which is where the idea of Aliens vs Predator originated.POSSIBLE SPOILERSMy only minor complaint with this film is that it is too short, and in that time they spend so much time developing the characters but don't give them any real developing dialogue, then once they get into the action a lot of them get killed, and then a few more get picked off shortly there-after. And the obvious disappointment that one alien manages to kill two predators in a way-too-short battle. BUT the idea behind that is that because the Alien got the drop on them when they were distracted, which caused for a sloppy fight, which lead to the lead Predator's (Celtic Predator) death",Null,0,1,13 August 2004
Batman Begins," Ah, Finally!
","Batman has always been my favourite comic book character. I remember being about 10 years old when Batman & Robin came out in theatres, and ready to leave the theatre about half way through it, it's pretty bad when a 10 year old kid finds a batman movie pathetic.After leaving the theatre I recall saying something like 'Why? Why did they make the films this way? Tim Burton's were WAY better. I hope the next one is done like Burton's' And I'm sure everyone hoped the same.Including Christopher Nolan, he knew what Batman needed, what Batman should be, and what the entire series of films always lacked. those being, that it needed a fresh start, no prequels (that would keep it in line with the last two) but no, starting fresh would leave the films to be limitless in possibilities, and bring back some original villains with a more menacing twist.Batman should be like Tim Burton's films (based on Frank Miller's comics) and Christopher Nolan captured the essence of Frank Miller's stories with his own dark, more up to date film.Finally, we see Christopher Nolan gave Batman what all the other films lacked, development on how he really became Batman. If you watch the other films (not really counting the last two) he was always batman, all you know is that his parents were murdered, and then he became Batman. There was no depth or emotion to the character, not to mention how does a billionaire just decide on becoming batman? and where does he get all the gadgets and install all the fancy equipment without somebody besides Alfred knowing he is batman? All of this is answered in Batman Begins. A true masterpiece in film, and I can only see the franchise growing greater, I don't think Warner Bros. would dare let Joel Schumacher even VISIT the set for the sequel.11 out of 10 :)",Null,1,2,18 June 2005
Twilight," ugh
","I finally caved and watched this movie for the first time last night...I'm not a hater, I try to give objective reviews, I'm a male, I'm straight, I love all types of movies including vampire movies. But I'm sorry; this movie was awful. Here's why: - No character development= This is a two-hour film and that's more than enough time for the movie to set up it's characters and make you care about them yet aside from Edward and Bella, everyone else seems like they were only in the movie for four seconds. NOBODY leaves you with the impression that they matter.<ul><li>dry pointless dialogue= it felt like at least 90 minutes of this film were Edward and Bella staring at each other. The only significant dialogue I remember is him saying how he wants to murder her but will fight the urge to do so and somehow that made her fall in love with him. Aside from that it was all 'high school stuff' pretty much. Which would be fine if it was interesting in any way.</li></ul><ul><li>cardboard cutout characters = As I said earlier, none of the characters get any development, Bella shows up on her first day at her new school and basically gets a whole group of best friends. Yes they established she knew some of them from when she was what, 4? But it was just way too convenient and lazy writing that they all meet her and say 'Hey wanna hang out? I value your opinion on everything even though we just met.' and everyone she bumps into all happen to be in the same clique.</li></ul><ul><li>terrible acting = Absolutely zero chemistry between Edward and Bella...ironic seeing as how they were dating in real life. I know some of the actors in the movie are actually pretty good so I chalk up a lot of that to the dialogue and directing.</li></ul><ul><li>incoherent pacing = The three evil vampires, shirtless Channing Tatum stand in, evil chick who was in the movie for 5 seconds and black dread-lock dude. Who go around brutally murdering people. Then black dude shows up at the Cullen's to warn them about Channing Tatum's stand in for no reason at all. Then he just leaves and that's that. So that whole threat lasted about 4 seconds when the Cullens all kill the sh*t out of him. The romance between Edward and Bella...he does all this creepy stuff that literally would cause any woman to file a restraining order makes her fall in love with him, then they play vampire baseball and then bad vampires hiss at them and then disappear.</li></ul><ul><li>no plot = girl moves to a small town, falls in love with creepy guy, then there's the threat of 3 evil vampires that gets solved in 5 minutes. This could have been a 42 minute after school special.</li></ul>You could use the excuse that 'You should read the book to fully understand everything!'. No actually I SHOULDN'T have to read the book to understand a movie. The whole point of film adaptations is to convert the book into a visual narrative that may alter/remove/add things in order to tell the story more cohesively on screen...but to throw a bunch of crap together and say 'Well, people should read the book to like the movie better' are just lazy and suck at their jobs.Yes, it is tailor made for teenage girls. However, it's also saying that teenage girls are stupid and will eat this crap up because it's made for them. You can make something for teenagers and still have it be good. Sadly, they know they don't have to put the effort in because teenage girls DO eat this crap up. It's really a sad testament to society these days.",Null,6,9,10 May 2013
Saving Private Ryan," If you hate this movie then you should understand something...
","Many reviews I have heard about this movie that are negative all say something along the lines that it shows the Americans as heroes, shows the Germans as evil killing monsters, and that it basically is just a big American Propaganda film. Lets be serious here, WW2 has been over for quite a while, we know who won the war, we know who the bad guys were...The Waffen SS and Hitler. So there is no need to have a WW2 propaganda film almost 60 years after the war had ended. The Wermacht soldiers they do battle with in this film are not shown as monsters, they are basically not given any character, just as the enemy that needs to be killed in order to win the battle. Which is exactly what the Germans were to the Allies in WW2. Not to mention the soldier that confronts Upham on the stairwell, if the Germans were portrayed as mindless killers then that Soldier would not have had a second's hesitation to kill Upham. This film shows the war through the eyes of a small group of US soldiers. The Germans are referred to as krauts, and just as the enemy. This is deliberate during wars to show the enemy as objects instead of human beings so it makes it easier for them to kill the enemy.It shows the Americans as heroes...not for winning the war, but for the battles they fight in during the course of the film. Yes it shows the US soldiers taking Omaha Beach in 30 minutes when it obviously took a lot more than that. But this movie is FICTIONAL it is only INSPIRED by real events, nor does it say anywhere in the film 'this movie is based on a true story.' It glorifies the deaths of the main characters, because like i said before it is shown through the eyes of this group of soldiers. Therefore they'd be up close and have their friends dying in their arms, and it would be emotional. Not that it was any different for the German soldiers, but the US soldiers wouldn't know because the Germans were the enemy to them. If they were to make this film from the German's point of view, then any American who hates it, and loves this film is an ignorant hypocrite. So before you chastise Spielberg and the film itself. Just think about that.",Null,4,7,24 September 2005
Insidious," Hands down one of the best horror films in a long time.
","{Spoiler at very bottom, will be labelled as such}It takes quite a bit for me to actually consider a movie scary, or even creepy. Very few horror movies I consider truly scary. The only movies that I can think of off the top of my head that I actually found frightening were Event Horizon (keep in mind I was 11 when I saw it). The Exorcism of Emily Rose, and The Ring. Anything else I found to be boring, a rip off of something else, or at very least an entertaining film but not scary. The main problem is that most modern horror movies feel that they have to have something scary happen in pretty much EVERY scene. It gets so tedious and takes no time to build up tension. Then of course there's films like the Saw series who think gore is scary. It's not scary, it's disgusting and uninteresting.Then along came Insidious. I chose to skip seeing it in the theatre when I heard that James Wan (director of the first Saw) was helming the project. (that being said I did think Dead Silence another one of his movies was pretty creepy) But I decided I hadn't seen any ghost movies in a while and the worst thing that could happen was that I would get a laugh out of it. So I picked the movie up on blu-ray cheap and watched it that night. Boy was I glad I did. This film did everything right. Went against pretty much every clichÃ© (I know writer Leigh Wannell said he had a list of horror clichÃ©s so he could avoid using them). The pacing, atmosphere, timing of scares was all perfect. Also there was a significant amount of showing us lots of stuff, but not really SHOWING us which I thought worked amazing.My only issue was...SPOILER BELOW:The need for a downer, open-ended finale. I'm okay with ambiguous endings but when a family has more or less literally gone through hell, I'm okay with a happy ending. But that's me.",Null,2,3,6 October 2011
X-Men: The Last Stand," Sadly another misunderstood sufferer of Alien 3 syndrome
","For those of you unfamiliar with Alien 3 syndrome; Basically it's an installment in a franchise that tries to take a darker, more emotional approach than it's predecessors, which is usually ill-received by fans and critics, also some difficulties during production can affect it as well (i.e. Bryan Singer was originally going to direct but left to do Superman Returns, and was replaced at the last minute with Brett Ratner).The main problem with this film is that it WAS too short, X2 was just over 2 hours and it covered everything perfectly. This film is roughly the same length of the first movie, and while the first movie was more about introducing the main characters and having a small plot and a bit of action, this film didn't bother giving much depth into the characters you already knew, but tried to introduce new characters and develop them, but tried to cram too many in and also have lots of action...but at the same time the way the film flows it seems that there were some scenes that would have been significant to the new characters that were cut out of the film. Such as Ben Foster's character (Angel) seemed to be cut out quite a bit.Also people think this will be the last film in the series due to some of the characters being killed off. But anyone who is familiar with X-men knows that if a character is killed off doesn't mean they wont come back ;). Also it might have something to do with the actors don't want to reprise their role so instead of having a new actor in the role, they kill the character off.But for now just know that this film is a just sequel to X2 and I consider it to be the 2nd best film in the series. And as I'm sure you've read in other comments keep watching after the credits. (and hopefully they'll release a director's cut!)",Null,0,0,18 June 2006
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," If this movie didn't fulfill all your theories, you have only yourself to blame.
","'This is not going to go the way you think.' is an understatement. I rarely ever write reviews, because my opinion doesn't matter. However, I feel the need to address the vitriol against this movie.
For the last two years I've listened to countless theories; Snoke is definitely this person, Rey's parents have got to be such and such. It's been relentless. Some of the theories were decent and plausible. The majority of them were idiotic. I admit that even I got caught up in a couple of them, but I wasn't committed to any particular theory. When finally watching the film, I feel my experience was partly ruined because when certain things happened I kept thinking 'Oh no, that's really going to piss people off.'. Then I snapped out of it and realized that I didn't care what people think. I loved every second of this film and now that I've had time to process it, I'm glad they went in the direction they did for the majority of the big 'mysteries'. If you've been discussing, deconstructing and committing to certain ideas of how the movie is going to play out, you've just set yourself up for major disappointments. This movie definitely didn't play out how I expected in almost every scene, which I was pleased to see that a Star Wars movie could still surprise me.So maybe take some time, think about this and give it another watch. See if your opinion changes.",Null,8,25,18 December 2017
Clash of the Titans," It's definitely better than it's getting credit for. But still could have been better.
","I've noticed that most of the reviews panning this movie seem to be more about complaining about the 3D effects. News flash people; the greedy studio heads decided to convert this movie to 3D at the last possible minute. Therefore the 3D effects look like crap because not only was it rushed, but it wasn't filmed in 3D!!! So if it was that bad why the hell would you sit through the entire movie then write a review on how bad the movie was? Go get your money back and watch it in 2D! As for the movie itself; I had only seen the original about a week before seeing the remake. While I enjoyed some elements of the original, I thought it was lacking in terms of pace. This film, definitely improves on the pace, and you get to care a bit more the rest of the soldiers that followed Perseus into the underworld. My main complaint is that they added a new female character to the plot, and as much as I enjoy seeing Gemma Aterton, it pushed away focus from Andromeda. Who really was crucial to the plot. So here we are caring for Io, and not really seeing enough of Andromeda to really be concerned for her. Yet the whole plot is about saving her more or less.Bottom line, great action/adventure movie. Doesn't really follow Greek mythology so don't let that shock you. Could have used a bit more character development but most action movies could. I give it 8/10.",Null,2,5,24 November 2010
Mission: Impossible II," Never knew a Mission Impossible movie or John Woo movie could be this boring.
","I never got a chance to see this movie at the theatre, but when it came out on video I was very pumped for it. I really enjoyed the first mission impossible and this film, with it's awesome sound track, (limp bizkit being one of my favourite bands AND doing the theme song.) and all the promotions for it seemed like it was going to kick ass. Also I'm a fan of John Woo's American movies such as Face/Off, Replacement Killers and Broken Arrow (Haven't seen his Hong Kong flicks) all signs pointed to this movie being non-stop action with some good humour thrown in the mix.What I got was a very long, dragged out, dry, humourless, predictable movie with literally zero action until the end of the film. Not to mention, Limp Bizkit's theme wasn't even used for more than 12 seconds! John Woo is famous for using slow motion, it's one of his trademarks. Which is fine for action sequences and so on. But Woo uses slow-motion in practically every scene. So this two hour movie is really only about an hour and a half, but dragged out because so much was done in slow motion. There was a scene where Thandie Newton's character approaches Dougray Scott's character. I swear to god the scene is 5 minutes long simply slow motion of them staring at each other. Also, the dialogue is so lacking that there's virtually no character development on anyone. All around a disappointment. As I write this review I'm re-watching the movie on blu-ray for the first time and my opinion hasn't changed. 5 out of 10 because it did lead to M:I3 and M:IGP",Null,0,2,2 March 2012
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," The movie suffers from the fact that people hate Michael Bay.
","I've read comment after comment trashing this movie. I honestly don't know why! Yeah it's got some dumb stuff in it, but so did the first one. And am I the only person who actually watched the original transformers series? Or the 1987 cartoon movie? It was PACKED with stupid scenes and bad dialogue! There was even a scene where a Weird Al song called 'dare to be stupid' played and all the transformers broke out into a huge dance number! No my friends, this movie is loaded with action and humour. The only problem with it is that people immediately hate it because Michael Bay is at the helm. People were lining up to trash the first movie but guess what, to everyone's surprise it was actually good! This film is no different. The first movie developed the characters which leaves more room for action in this film. But due to the simple fact that people couldn't trash the first film because it was actually good, which meant it was open season on this film no matter what the quality of the movie.So yes, I am a Michael Bay fan, I love The Rock, enjoy both Bad Boys, always get a kick out of Armageddon, and so on. Do I expect any movies like this or any of his future films to win the best picture Oscar? No, I expect them to be entertaining, which so far has happened every time.So here's a tip for you, if you hate Michael Bay's movies STOP &*%#ING WATCHING THEM! I hate Uwe Boll's movies, so guess what I don't watch them anymore, same with Roland Emmerich (who is often compared next to Bay), Renny Harlin, and a few others.",Null,2,5,5 December 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Brings meaning to Episode 1 and 2
","yes, many people don't like Episodes 1 and 2, I quite enjoyed Episode 1, but I was disappointed with parts of episode 2, but it was still enjoyable...yes Jar Jar was a bit much, but he was more to keep young children entertained. But Episode 3 ties both trilogies together, and also improves the quality of episodes 1 and 2 Many people fail to realize that these films are based on George Lucas's unique vision. They are what he wanted them to be. People say he relies too much on special effects...well the original star wars trilogy had the state of the art jaw dropping special effects for its time, yet nobody said he relied too much on special effects. And i'm sure the only reason the originals don't have as much special effects is because the technology was too limited.Anyways...Episode 3 is the conclusion that ties everything together, which also shows that Episodes 1 and 2 are really just setting up for Episode 3...the story for episode 1 was a little thin...it basically showed how Palpatine was playing everyone in order to come to power. Episode 2 was a set up to the beginning of the clone war and just shows how arrogant and reckless Anakin is. Also but barely develops the love story between Padme and Anakin.",Null,1,6,24 May 2005
The Dark Knight Rises," Now I know why Christopher Nolan wanted to end the series...there's no way he could top this.
","When the Dark Knight came out, I knew it was highly anticipated. However, I was surprised at just how successful it was. 8.9 on IMDb, smashing box office records, etc. I had very high expectations for it and it definitely met them. However, I admit I was very excited and my friends and I discussed the possibilities the movie could have and over- thought it to death. So when I finally saw the film, I couldn't help but feel slightly disappointed that some of my ideas didn't come to fruition. But that was my own fault for letting my expectations get undoubtedly high. The more times I watched the film, the more I enjoyed it. I did not think Christopher Nolan could top that.When The Dark Knight Rises was finally put into production, I vowed to myself that I would not let my expectations get too high and that I wouldn't over-think the film again. Of course, I wound up doing that anyways. I was bursting at the seams for this film and did this film meet my expectations? No, it blew my expectations away completely. Anyone who saw the film and I asked what they thought; 'wow' is all that came to their mind. I respond to the question 'Well, I don't want to over-sell it. But it was one of the greatest movies I've ever seen.' The acting is superb, better than the first two combined and they were both top-notch as well. (Seeing as how Heath Ledger won the Oscar for The Joker) the fact that the movie is promoted as the conclusion of a trilogy gives everything a very, shall we say 'Mortal' feeling. Any beloved characters have the possibility of dying, as they need not be concerned with bringing them back for a sequel. Which gives the film a much more suspenseful feel. The film strikes a very human and emotional chord with not only Bruce Wayne and Alfred, but with all the characters including the villains. They are all humanized, all their motives are made clear. The film takes you to a very low emotional point, the most grim out of the three films (which is odd, it's usually second in a trilogy) to the point where it doesn't seem possible to come out of this dark place. However, the movie 'rises' up from the misery and leads to a perfectly executed, beautiful and satisfying conclusion. Well done to Christopher Nolan, and all the cast. My two biggest regrets are that there won't be a sequel and there won't be a superhero movie done this well ever again. But I'd rather have a fantastic trilogy than have the series turn to crap as the previous franchise did.P.S. Both Tom Hardy and Michael Caine deserve Oscars for their performances, but being the pretentious load of BS that is the Oscars, I doubt either of them will get nominated. I believe Heath Ledger, while completely deserving of winning the Oscar, only was because he passed away after the film was made. If either Hardy or Caine are nominated, then there may be hope for the Oscars. Even more so if one of them wins.",Null,5,13,27 July 2012
300," In defense of the negative press
","I will start by addressing the negative reviews on this film. I'm sure you've heard by now, how upset Iranians are over the portrayal of Persians in the film. I won't be able to convince them otherwise, their minds have been made up, but if what they say about it turns you off of the movie, or you are of Iranian background, etc....PLEASE read this then make up your mind; First off, the MOVIE is based on a GRAPHIC NOVEL/COMIC BOOK. It is not based on actual historical fact. I don't know much about the actual battle, but I know that this movie doesn't adhere to much fact, I mean if you've seen the commercials, I doubt the Persians actually had giant zombie-like mutant soldiers to unleash. That alone should show you that the film is not done as real life. Like all comic books or war movies, there are at least two enemies. Generally speaking, one is focused as the good guys, the other as the villains. 95% of the time this is done because the film is shown from the point of view of one side. If there was an opposite version of 300 showing the Persians side, I'm sure the Persians wouldn't have an ounce of complaint of them vilifying the Spartans. How many times has this happened before? Saving Private Ryan? practically every war movie showing the side of the Allies, shows the Germans as bad guys. Now that's just the point of view from the allied soldiers. But the German army was just fighting for their country, the only true villains were Hitler, The SS, and the Nazis. Braveheart showed the English as cruel tyrants, every single man, woman, and child. But that doesn't mean they actually were. So keep all these things in mind when watching 300. Remember, it isn't a FACTUAL movie. (Also take into account how many comic books in the 40's showed superheroes kicking hell out of the 'evil' German soldiers.)Now onto the good stuff; There are outstanding movies in every genre, and this is probably the greatest film in it's genre of epic war films. It stands alone due to its unique qualities, the comic book edge allows for things that haven't been done in battle movies of the same sort, the sound of the film is probably the best ever made for a movie. Every sound has an effect, it penetrates through you, whether it be the Spartan's war cry, Leonidas' giving one of his many welcome speeches, to something as simple as sticking a spear in the ground. You feel it. I have seen this movie twice already, and most likely a third by the time you are reading this. Let me say that I NEVER go see a movie more than once in the theater, no matter how much I am looking forward to it. the only other films I've gone to see more than once was Star wars Episode I, which I saw 4 times...when I was 12. Which is tied with Star Wars: A New Hope when it was re-released, I think I was about 10 for that one.This has already become my favorite war movie. I am sure many will agree with me, and few won't. But if you haven't seen it yet, I can't tell you not to build it up in your mind so you'd be disappointed, simply because you can't be disappointed! If you think it looks good from the commercial, it is 300x better (no pun intended).",Null,3,8,18 March 2007
