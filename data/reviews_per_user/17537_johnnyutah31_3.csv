Hereditary," Methodic Fright
","It's been a while since I've been so excited to see a film. This movie has been highly anticipated since its trailer debut and the closer it got to its release date, the more worried I was it wouldn't meet the expectations. I can gladly say after seeing it today, expectations were met with a little extra maybe to boot. First off, in all my years of movie going, this was the first time I actually saw people walking out the theater. Not because they weren't enjoying it, but because they clearly felt it was a bit too overwhelming, especially towards the end. I could hear one woman behind say as she walked out 'i can't anymore, this is too much.' The films finale is something to behold. It's a definite slow burn of a film, at times a little dull, but it all leads to something quite unsettling and explosive in its own intense way. The acting is all around special with Toni Collette giving a powerhouse performance. There's no jump scares here, no creepy ghost kids or phantom ladies with black smokey eye sockets. It's a dramatic film with levels of uneasiness being elevated as the film progresses. It also doesn't require too much analysis either, it's pretty straight forward but not simply drawn out for you also, if that makes sense. Easily one of the best films I've seen this year.",8,2,4,18 September 2018
A Quiet Place," Without the star power = SYFY movie of the week
","Just got back from watching 'A Quiet Place' and I really wished I would've saw this at home, on VOD or something because that's where I feel most content watching generic 'creature feature' type films. I was really rooting for this film. I like John Krasinski and I was excited to see him star and direct a horror film. From the trailer I knew although the premise was gimmicky, if done correctly it could've ended up being a unique film. Unfortunately what ruined it for me was that through its simplistic setup , it opened up too many plot holes. It's completely illogical and really hard to ignore all its flaws. The CGI'd monsters are uninspired and the resolve at the end is quite silly. There's some thrilling moments here, most of them you probably glimpsed in the trailer. I guess if you're able to overlook a lot of things in this film then you could find some enjoyment in it. But for me I couldn't get past how nonsensical it was.",5,8,17,26 April 2018
Black Panther," Just a bad film, period.
",Judging this film solely on its entertainment value and in comparison to other films in the MCU and you'll see it's barely serviceable. Black Panther himself was a complete bore. Almost nothing the guy did got a reaction out of me. I was looking forward to Michael B Jordan's performance and I was so disappointed. It was totally one note and uninspired. The CGI was terrible as well. Watching Black Panther jump around reminded me of Harry Potter in the first film playing Quidditch. And the technology displayed was way too overdone. They could've downplayed it a little.This will go right along with Iron Man 3 for the weakest films so far in the Marvel Collective.,4,1,1,13 May 2018
