The Hangover," Not You Fat Jesus!
","Here it is...one of the ultimate Lad films around!What makes this film so amazing? Well picture this...you and your friends go out for a few drinks. Next thing you remember, your waking up in different places, not in your bed and end up looking for your friends whilst piecing together the previous night. Sounds familiar right?Well The Hangover exemplifies that, as Alan, Stu, Phil & Doug have a night out in Vegas for Doug's bachelor party. After having an epic hotel room, and toasting to their night, they suddenly all wake up in different places, and have to piece together their night to find Doug before his wife-to-be finds out!The acting is superb in this...I expected it from Cooper, but this film made Galifianakis & Jeong famous for their hilarious roles as Alan and Mr. Chow respectively!The humour is constant throughout, with great direction and cinematography. Everyone who has ever had one-too-many drinks on a boys' night out with their best friends can relate to this film, and the relating problems that ensue with alcohol-induced amnesia. Personally, I found myself relating a lot to the character in these kinds of films that always wakes up first then has to see where his friends are, as alcohol does not allow me a peaceful sleep!",10,1,2,26 June 2015
Blade," Wesley Snipes at His Best!
","This film is absolutely incredible! Wesley Snipes is at his best!The film is about Blade, whose mother was attacked by a vampire whilst she was still pregnant with him, which made her water break and she gave birth to Blade, but died in the process. A half vampire half human, he has all of the vampires' strengths and none of their weaknesses, bar one...the thirst to feed on blood! Having been found by Whistler, they decide to team up to take on the vampires.From the go, this movie is action packed with Blade entering a vampire nightclub to kick some ass! The film then continues to show how the vampires lived in secrecy but Deacon Frost wishes to take control of the world using 'La Magra', the blood god!The music from this movie is great, its filmed very well and the story flows completely. Every fight scene is incredible and well- choreographed, and by the end of the film you'll want to grab your version of Whistler and go find some vampires (if only they existed!)",10,3,5,16 January 2014
The Terminator," Schwarzenegger At His Best!
","Originally, whilst writing the review for Predator, I thought that was Arnold Schwarzenegger's best role, however, one of my favourite actors of all time was at his absolute best in this movie! A must see for any action movie lovers!The film is about a robot sent back through time to kill the mother of John Connor, whom will eventually lead the resistance against the machines in the war following judgement day. The human resistance also sent back a soldier, however, in Kyle Reese, to fight the machine and help protect Sarah, John's mother. Kyle and Sarah must find a way to stop the unstoppable, and this robot will kill everyone and everything in order to complete his machine!The film just basically depicts their fight against the Terminator, which is portrayed amazingly by Arnie and actually I do not believe any actor in the world could have portrayed the cold hearted machine better! There are some truly amazing action scenes here, such as the police station, and the brutality of the Terminator is shown from the start when he destroys a group of punks.",10,2,3,16 January 2014
Scary Movie 2," Father...FATHER!!! This is not part of the ritual!
","Scary Movie 2 continues in the vain of its prequel, with hilarious spoofs of infamous movies!This time, the main film that is having the mickey taken out of it is The Exorcist, with references to other horror movies such as Chucky!The film once again revolves around the majority of the main cast from the Scary Movie 1, but this time they have been falsely led to a haunted house by their university professors!From the beginning, this film is hilarious, with the opening scenes involving the priests' exchange with the possessed child being absolutely hilarious!The film maintains its humor throughout, with Anna Faris & Marlon Wayans deserving extra credit for their part.At times, the jokes can be a bit too silly, nonetheless, its not one to watch with expectations of a gripping plot, and much more funny if one is familiar with the films that are being imitated. Overall, still a good laugh!",8,0,1,25 June 2015
Blade II," The House of Pain - Amazing!
","Whoever said that the original of a series is always the best, clearly had not seen Blade II!Snipes is back, and oh my gosh is he incredible! I don't think the director could have casted an actor more suited for the role!Blade II involves Blade fighting against the vampires again, however, he soon realises that the old adage 'the enemy of my enemy is my friend' is true when a new monster stalks the streets, known as Reapers. These creatures feed on vampires, and then humans, so Blade is forced to align with the vampires in order to fight against the Reapers.From the start of the film, the adrenaline is pumping with Blade fighting multiple vampires, and coming to the rescue of an old friend whom is still alive!Once again, the movie is excellently filmed with the different angles to capture the fight scenes and the music is amazing. Every fight scene is once again filmed perfectly, and this film contains one of my favourite ever action-movie fight scenes when Blade and the vampire council fight against the Reapers in a underground nightclub called 'The House of Pain', the name itself is epic!Amazing. Only criticism I had of this film is that it ended.",10,2,5,16 January 2014
Predator," Incredible Sci-Fi Action Movie, Must See!
","Predator is one of the best Schwarzenegger films out there!Schwarzenegger plays the character of Dutch, whom is in charge of an elite special forces commando squad consisting of Mac, Blain, Billy, Poncho and Hawkins. Following a visit from former member Dillon, they are asked to embark on a mission to a remote South American jungle to rescue POWs captured by rebels.The actual raid on the rebel encampment is filmed amazingly, with the commandos intellect and strength displayed excellently by the actors, and leads one to only imagine how much the military has progressed since the late '80s! There is a twist, however, as Poncho is assassinated in mysterious circumstances it becomes clear that there is something else present in this jungle, something much more clever and stronger than the commandos!Brilliant acting, Arnie at his best, and definitely great action scenes throughout the movie!",10,0,1,16 January 2014
Die Hard 2," Caught In The Prequel's Shadow
","John McClane has returned and this man is definitely complete strangers with Lady Luck! The film starts with McClane going to meet his wife, Holly, at the airport. Its the Christmas period and the airport is busy. Having seen something suspicious, McClane follows two men into the baggage carousel however a shootout ensues which leaves one of the men dead. Once it is discovered that this man is a former marine who faked his own death, alarm bells ring and trouble ensues!Whilst Holly is on the plane terrorist hijack the command tower of Dulles Airport and threaten to kill all unsuspecting passengers currently in the air if the command tower does not divert a plane carrying a captured drug-lord into Dulles Airport, and allow the terrorists to escape with their companion!The film is very clever, Bruce Willis is once again incredible in the role of John McClane and actually the only complaint in this film is that there was not enough action, although when McClane stabs a terrorist in the eye with an icicle that moment was brutal yet epic at the same time! One or two twists as well which always help keep you entertained!Hard to follow up the original, but definite must watch and not a bad film at all, just caught in the shadow of the prequel.",8,1,1,28 January 2014
Magic Mike XXL," Condiments! What An Awful Idea!
","This film was a lot better than the prequel, in my opinion!So the film starts off following Magic Mike (Tatum) as he tries to lead a normal life...then he gets a call explaining one of his former dance colleagues has passed away. As he attends the so called 'wake', he realizes it is a lie, and that his friends just wanted to lure him to meet up with them. Why? One final show, together!From then on, its just non-stop dancing and flirting! OK, so I'm a guy, and I'll admit it is a film geared towards girls. With a film like this, I did not go in expecting a convincing story line & to be frank, there wasn't really one present. Other downers include a pretty poor ending, and in my opinion Kevin Nash's character was just useless & looked misplaced!But why did I rate it so highly then? Firstly, Tatum is such an excellent dancer it is unreal! It takes real talent to be able to pull of such dance moves. The choice of music was pretty excellent too, and his co-stars were pretty decent dancers too! Finally, there was quite a fair bit of comedy present!So in conclusion, I can see why guys would hate this film, however, the dance sequences are great & let's be honest, many guys would trade quite a bit to be able to dance like these guys!",8,4,17,3 July 2015
From Dusk Till Dawn," Hit-And-Miss Tarantino Creates His Biggest Hit
","Quentin Tarantino is a very hit-and-miss sort of Director for me, as sometimes his movies are incredible and sometimes they enter the realms of being too bizarre. This one was definitely a hit for me!The film starts giving background to the Gecko Brothers (played by Clooney and Tarantino), with Clooney having originally been caught and imprisoned for armed robbery. Tarantino breaks him out, but they need to find a way across the border to Mexico (a safe haven nicknamed 'El Rey'). Throughout their journey they encounter multiple obstacles from police patrols to dealing with a hostage situation. Eventually they take a former priest and his daughter and son hostage, in order to get across the border.Once they get across the border, the Gecko brothers decide to celebrate at a striptease establishment, and then from there things go to hell real quick as the staff turn out to be vampires!In typical Tarantino style, it becomes more apparent as the film goes on that his character suffers from serious mental illnesses, which ensues him to rape, and misconstrue reality. For me, the acting was incredible between Clooney and Tarantino. The action scenes, as well, are excellent, and the sudden change into a vampire survival movie is actually one that I enjoyed. The transition was not a boring one either, as there is constant action throughout the movie and the story line is consistent.This movie will always be one of Tarantino's best!",10,0,1,15 June 2014
A Clockwork Orange," One Of The Most Ambiguous Movies Ever Made
","Whilst the reader of this review will question my title, I implore them to read the other reviews of this movie, and it will become clear why I chose such a title. This movie is purely dependent on the person watching the movie, what he/she takes from it.The film was made in 1971, some 43 years before I'm writing this review. I have more pros then cons about this movie, but let's start with the cons. I felt the movie did not shock me as some other movies have, perhaps this is because in nearly half a century we have wised up to the deep, dark underbelly of this world or quite simply I have been exposed to it. Further to this, the film was a bit long to watch in one sitting. Finally, the actual lingo was a bit to hard to understand, and I've lived in England for 11 years now!The positives were I thought the actual cinematography and filming of this was pretty good, and the main protagonists acting was second-to- none. More to the point, I really adore how this movie depicts that as a criminal, he continued to get away with multiple crimes but it was only once he became good (by force, may I add) that he was well and truly eaten up by the world. Whilst harsh, it shows that the world we live in now may not have much space left for the pure of heart anymore. To follow from this, I like how the main character shows that each human is different, and how when it comes to someone's mental state, anything can trigger a reaction unexpected. The best example of this is his reaction to Beethoven's 9th symphony. I especially like how the film portrays the underhanded dealings of a government, summed up in the scene at the end with the main character sitting with the Minister, whom speaks so politically in a way that basically depicts the sneaky way in which politicians go about their business.Whilst I only gave this film a 7, I would say it is a much watch as there is something oddly fascinating about this film, and kudos to the director for filming it in such a way that everyone has a different opinion and focal point on the movie.",7,0,4,10 June 2014
Die Hard," Best Ever Disaster Film
","John McClane, of the NYPD, has flown out to LA to see his wife Holly Genero and his kids for Christmas. He is picked up at the airport by Argyle, a limousine driver sent by Holly's boss.After the initial meet up, Holly and John have an argument which results in Holly storming out and leaving John by himself. This is when 12 terrorists, led by Hans Gruber, take over the Nakatomi building and John is forced to escape to elsewhere in the building.The film is constant action, filmed incredibly with John constantly having to outwit and out gun his opponents, with the aid of the LAPD which actually, in truth, get completely annihilated by the terrorists. There are many catchy quotes, such as 'yippee-ki-yay motherf*cker', and many comedic lines which is exactly what a great film needs! The way the terrorists conduct themselves is incredibly intellectual, leaving multiple false trails for police to follow in order to hide their true intentions, which will not be revealed here!Bruce Willis portrays John McClane incredibly, and I have seen this film about 20 times and will never say no to watching it again. 10/10!",10,1,2,16 January 2014
Sherlock Holmes," Never Knew Sherlock Holmes Could Be So Cool
","Holmes & Dr. Watson are back, this time in a modern movie remake of the popular sleuth novels.I'm not going to lie, when I first heard about this film being released in cinemas I was worried, as there have been many attempts to create a good film from successful novels, but have failed to accurately capture the level of depth and detail in the books.When I watched this film, however, I was blown away and did not regret my decision at all. Holmes and Watson, portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law, are played superbly. The acting is second-to-none, but the story line is incredibly gripping. The action scenes are outstandingly filmed, with Holmes and Watson shown to have the combative element not mentioned in the novels, however, when it came to the movie this added to it very nicely.To top it all off, the story line is very captivating, and my favourite personal touch is actually how Holmes figures everything out and all is explained throughout the movie in due course.Must watch, for action movie fans and for Sherlock Holmes lovers!",10,0,2,7 June 2014
The Matrix," Red Pill, Or The Blue One?
","This is one of those films, that has so much meaning in it, its unreal! However, the action scenes are incredible, and the concept is original.It starts with Neo (Reeves) living a dual life, one as a computer hacker, one as a standard 9-5 office worker in a technology conglomerate. After a strange dream, Neo awakens & never quite feels normal, always questioning the blandness of his life.Once he is hacked, he is told to 'follow the rabbit down the hole', which is the proceeded by a knock on the door. Once he answers the door, he realizes it is just his friends asking him to join them on a night out. Whilst he initially declines, Neo then spots a tattoo in the shape of a white rabbit, and decides to listen to the earlier message so he joins them on a night out.The film contains everything, from great acting, good dialogue and my favorite is an original story line. The idea that we, as humans, are happy to continue working 9 to 5, whilst questioning our purpose on this planet. Coupled with our increased dependency on machines in the modern age means that the idea that machines will eventually supersede us is not a fairy tale concept.The action is great, with some of the characters now becoming infamous, most noticeably Fishburne's character Morpheus, seen as a sensei- type, but one with an incredibly high intellect, that teaches to ask the right question then look for the right answer.On the downside, this film contained too many action film moments where it was clearly possible to escape a fate, suspect a Judas-type moment, or to act faster and therefore make life so much easier on themselves!Really great movie, which for me beckons the ultimate question: Would you take the red pill, or the blue one?",8,0,0,25 June 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Guzzoline-Fueled Action!
","Mad Max: Fury Road is a film that portrays a future dystopia where chaos lingers amongst every part of the world.The film revolves around a character known as Max (Hardy), who is captured by a race of people, obsessed with plunging resources. The race is run by a dictator called Immortan Joe (Keays-Byrne), that promises a Valhalla-style heaven to his fallen warriors.Eventually, Max escapes his imprisonment but winds up with Furiosa (Theron) & Immortan Joe's wives; the group have to collaborate to escape Immortan Joe, whilst also finding a way to return to Furiosa's homeland, where it may still be possible for people to live in a sustainable manor.Now, the film does have great CGI, whilst the music included is very apt, specifically tailored to each scene. The best thing about this movie was definitely the action, with the final action scene being one of the best & longest action sequences I have watched throughout!The film, however, I just feels lacks something. The character himself, Max, whilst I understand he is the kind of superhero that is a man of few words, did not come across to me effectively & because of that, I did not feel his pain, anguish and actually did not care about him that much. I can't help but liken Max to Riddick from 'The Chronicles of Riddick' but I have to say that I felt Riddick himself was not only cooler, but the way he was presented I cared a lot more about him. Also, the whole concept that they left the Citadel to just then go back just does not seem right to me. Finally, I understand this is just a movie, but the amount of times Max survives impending doom, well, it is slightly unbelievable, even for a superhero!",7,0,6,5 July 2015
