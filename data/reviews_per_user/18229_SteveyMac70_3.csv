Hereditary," Solid horror but slightly overrated
","This is a good, solid horror but not as good as some are making out on here. No jump scares, more of a slow burning psychological horror albeit a little too slow paced at times, with a good twist. But, as in most modern horror movies, the director seems to run out of ideas of how to end the movie! The ending is certainly underwhelming to say the least. A solid 7 for me - Overall very well acted and good direction for the most but a few unnecessary 'arty' camera shots do nothing for the movie, Well worth watching but don't expect to be blown away. Is it the best horror movie of the year do far? Probably, but there is not a lot in the way of competition out there. I'm just hoping 'The Nun' lives up to its hype!",7,1,2,6 September 2018
Schindler's List," A powerful, evocative, must see movie
","I have just finished watching this movie for the first time and OMG how on earth did I let this one slip by! It has to me one of the most powerful, moving and thought evoking movies ever produced, made even more so by the fact that it is a true story and these atrocities actually happened. This is not my usual genre but I was engrossed for the full 3 hours 15 minutes that the movie ran for. Spielberg really brings this one home! This is arguably his best movie to date and he has some great movies to compare against. I have also seen Liam Neeson in a completely different light and this performance really highlights what a truly great actor he is.I know there are some views on here stating that we don't need these atrocities spelled out to us in such a brutal fashion but actually I think we do. Yes we all know that atrocities happened during WWII but watching Schindler's List brings home the reality of it and really lets you empathize with the plight of not just the Jews but every other persecuted people in nearly every other war throughout history and the genocide that is still happens today. We should never forget that this and other atrocities actually happened, which some quarters seem to want us to do in today's politically correct society. It also shows us that even in the darkest hour there will always be a light of hope and humanity and that there are still good people in the world.Everybody should see this movie once and even if you think it is too much and score a 1, you can't be human if you are not moved just a little.",10,1,4,12 August 2018
The Evil Dead," Clichéd, wooden, but still worth watching
","What better place to start with my first review than this classic 80's cult horror. I remember in my very early teens, all the hype surrounding this movie and scrambling around a friend's house to watch a grainy VHS copy totally against my parents' wishes, especially after the uproar that it had cause with the notoriously pompous British Censors which only added to the movies' allure. I recently decided to go through my old DVD collection so that I could give a rating to movies I had not seen in a long time and therefore had not rated. My attention was drawn to this movie very early in my task - I was not disappointed. Don't get me wrong. It is a pretty poor movie by today's standards and a complete cliché, but in a way, that's what makes it good! It's like a journey through a carnival house of horrors as an adult. The effects are shocking, you know what's coming yet it still makes you jump! The acting is outdated and almost wooden at times. The effects of the puss squirting from the arm and eyes is almost laughable but still you can't stop watching it. It still manages to create an atmosphere that draws you in and engrosses you so that you do not want to switch it off no matter how bad you tell yourself it is. But it isn't bad at all, it really is quite good. Take yourself back to the 80's and this movie truly was a masterpiece filmed on a budget but drawing the attention some of the so-called blockbusters of the time could only envy. I have seen this movie several times now and each time I come back with the same opinion - that it is definitely worth watching. If you are viewing for the first time, do so with an open mind and put yourself back in the early eighties to give yourself a fair go... you won't be disappointed. I can only give this movie a 7/10 which in my rating system is a movie worth watching and that is exactly what it is what it is nothing more, nothing less, but still a masterpiece of its time which if judged back then would have surely scored a straight 10",6,2,6,22 April 2018
