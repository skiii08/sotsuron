Conquest 1453," Don't believe the rating
","The only reason I watched this is because the high rating it got here in IMDb, but it left me totally disappointed First of all, special effects were overused in this movie, I can take it if they were good, but no, they were bad, so bad that it actually makes mutant chronicles look good, all cannon fires were special effects, they were so lousy that you might think it's one of Syfy low budget movies Battle scenes are horrible, random slow-mo at inappropriate moments ruins them even more Unnecessary romances, which was fiction, and lame, and LONG. Nobody expected romance when they went to the theater to watch this Stupid production staffs, isn't this a movie about Islam? After all those glorifying then they showed us Hasan the hero having illicit sexual relationship? of him engaging in premarital sex? that's sheer idiocy (well, i don't know if they already married or what but still this romance part is unnecessary) The ultimate disappointment is the scene where they transport the ship through land. This is the most famous part of the history of the conquest, yet only being shown for a minute?? This is the turning point of the conquest man...... Why didn't they show us the moment when the idea was proposed? That was rather insane idea, wouldn't the advisers against this, why was it approved? The movie pictured that moment as insignificantTo the production staffs : YOU FAILED MISERABLY",1,33,63,13 September 2012
Wind River," Amazing movie with a single flaw
","Great movie, but it has a single flaw.
I will only explain the flaw because many reviews have already explain the good points.So, not so much a spoiler, but there were casualties from the cops in this movie.
Probably several deaths or severely wounded.
Yet, when it's all over, no one showed concerns about them.
Instead, the movie was doubling down about how poor the victim girl was.I know this is a propaganda piece about the injustice to Native American, but C'mon, they were good cops dying in the line of duty and no gratitudes for them? 
This is another case of 'Oh shut up! you don't understand our feelings!'
I don't know whether there are scenes cut or what, but currently the writer-director is so deep in 'pretending to care about the suffering of certain something' that he is blind to other sufferings.",10,0,3,6 March 2018
Suicide Squad," Total Crap
","I watched this a long time ago but I washed my brain with Tide-Pods to cleanse it from this movie.Watched random Youtube video and this was mentioned so I got here and write a review.I just gonna list the problems with this crap :
1. This is not a squad of bad guys. This is a squad of good guys pretending to be bad guys acting like good guys. 
2. Most of the squad are irrelevant, useless, and annoying. Fireman, Crocodiles, Boomerangman, Slipknot, nobody cares about these people.
3. The enemies are crap. Enchantress is crap, her minions are faceless unlimited boring crap.
4. Corny everything. When Harley said, 'Don't hurt my friends!', I literally vomitted.",1,2,3,18 February 2018
Dunkirk," Nolan : Let's make people think that this movie is smart (Spoiler : It is not)
","Let's make a war movie from the perspectives of random soldiers, it would be fun.Oh, let's also not shown 'The Enemy' at all, it would be a masterpiece.Maybe it could be so, but it didn't.It failed spectacularly (But somehow people think this is epic, why?)Go watch Saving Private Ryan again then compare it to Dunkirk. If Saving Private Ryan is a 9 then Dunkirk would be a 2, and that's still a compliment.This is not smart evacuation movie, this is a boring and dumb soap opera. Bullets and Bombs literally came from nowhere. Boring characters you don't care about escaping from one place to another.Seriously guys, this is not a good movie, why is this so highly rated? Have most people on earth replaced by aliens from outer space that they think this is great movie?",1,4,6,6 December 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," Thanos is such a charismatic villain
","Same CGI villain like that Steppenwolf, but Thanos is much much moreRecent marvel villains have been awesome
Like Killmonger, Loki, Ultron, and now ThanosNot only powerful physically, but has interesting personality, and somewhat relatable
If you just recently watched the movie 'What Happened to Monday' then you might even support Thanos' actionsThat's it about Thanos
Now to the movie itselfIt lived to the hype
Not in the way that people predicted, but the epicness most likely satisfy everyone
Not gonna spoil, go watch it
Though I'm sure most of you have gotten the ticket already lol~",10,5,11,25 April 2018
Murder on the Orient Express," What a beautiful movie
","I cried at the end6.7 is too low of a scoreI got the same emotional overflow when I watched Shawshank Redemption
This should rank around 8-9 too
Either Perfectionist Agatha Christie's fans or Millennials by disposition lowering the scoreVery enjoyable and heartmoving movie
If you haven't read or watched any iteration of Murder on the Orient Express, watch this first",10,6,17,11 February 2018
Black Panther," A superhero movie made me cry...
","The pinned under the rubbles in Homecoming, Logan and Watchmen entire movie.
Those were emotional, but didn't make me cry.
But the relationship between T'Challa and Erik with their respective father made me cry.Among superhero movies I've watched, this is the best so farThe score for the reviews and ratings for this movie is kinda funky.
Just like Get Out, there are people that rated this too high or too low due to racial issue.
I say let's put that aside and judge this movie for it's quality as a movie.
Even the final message expressed by this movie, as said by T'Challa, is to build bridges to connect, help, and work together with everyone.But I digress,
Worthy of it's title as the best superhero movie so far (according to me), the actions, visual effects, and scale were amazing.
The music matches the tone of the scenes and overall enjoyable.The enemies are not 'faceless' like Ultron's robots, Avenger's aliens, Suicide Squad's and Justice League's Dumb Whatever-Those-Things are, and this is my favorite aspect of the movie, actual enemies with personalities and ideas.The only 'flaws' (not really but) to me are :
1. The villains were as interesting as Loki, but they were all dead. Pity.
2. Despite being a superhero movie, not much 'superheroing' done. Well, this is the internal strife part so understandable.In conclusion : Watch it",10,19,54,15 February 2018
