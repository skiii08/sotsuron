Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good opening to a new saga
","What a movie.  Outstanding effects, decent acting, and a terrific setup for events yet to come.  Many people criticize Lucas's storytelling abilities. I feel that he did a magnificent job in setting us up for Episode 2 and 3. He had to create new characters and locations, while still making us believe that we were watching a Star Wars movie.  I think he succeded.  As a stand alone movie, The Phantom Menace may not be one of the greatest films of all time. (Unless you are a true die hard such as myself)  But as an opening chapter of a new story, it is fantastic.Another criticism many people have is that there isn't enough characterization in Qui-Gonn or Darth Maul.  I don't feel that there really needed to be that much development there.  The characters that will continue the saga were developed perfectly.  These two characters were merely placeholders to help develop the other characters personalities and future identities.All in all, I was very pleased with The Phantom Menace.  I didn't expect it to be better than the original Trilogy, and I wasn't wrong.  If you like Star Wars, you won't be disappointed.  Even if you don't, it is still a very fun movie to watch.",10,0,0,5 June 1999
Event Horizon," MST3K
",The only good thing about this movie is the ability to pull a Mystery Science Theater 3000 on it.  The plot was predictable and very dumb.  Lame acting.,2,1,3,6 September 1998
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Booooooooring
","I have never read any of the books, and this movie definatly did not make me want to.  The scenery is great, but there was nothing else in the movie. The quittage match everyone is raving about was utterly pointless.  It in no way developed the storyline.  Actually, nothing developed the story until about two hours into the film.  What's with the quittage match anyhow?  Why do you get points for something that automatically makes you win the game?? Robbie Coltrane and Alan Rickman at least give something to watch.  They both delivered great performances.  Too bad they didn't have much to work with.  Had this movie been cut to about an hour and a half it might have been tolerable.  But as it is, there is too much wandering around for no apparent reason.  How children can sit through this is beyond me.  For fantasy movies, give me Lord of the Rings.  At least I know there will be something in that one.  And lastly, anybody know why John Cleese got top billing in the credits????",Null,0,0,20 November 2001
Man on Fire," Worst way to spend 2 1/2 hours so far this year...
","The idea behind this movie was a good one.  The story could have been good. Still, someone managed to screw things up.  I felt like the character development during the first hour was drawn out far too long.  Once you had the point of what was going on, it was beat into your head a few more times just in case.  Also, the style of the movie is horrendous.  Slow motion and jerky camera flashes completely destroy any tension or emotions that would have been built up by the actors.  Denzel is a fabulous actor, yet I felt absolutely nothing for his character.  Dakota Fanning is a remarkable child prodigy, yet in the end I really didn't care what happened to her.  I would have to say that really the only good that came from this film is that it makes the Punisher look good...",1,22,47,23 April 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Tolkien is rolling over in his grave...
","Well, the movie started off pretty slow.  The middle was pretty slow. And the end was well... slow.  There was not a single moment out of the entire three and a half hours that I felt any tension (except for the encounter with Shelob, but that's only because I'm terrified of spiders...)  The seige of Minas Tirith reminded me of the battle of Hoth, but not nearly as dramatic.  Jackson's device to build emotions is to have the characters stare at each other for a long period of time, sometimes in slow motion.In the end, it seems to me that there were different people that worked on each of the three films.  I thoroughly enjoyed the Fellowship of the Ring. It had everything - two battles in which you actually cared about the characters.  With the extended DVD there was great character development. And there was a comedic value.  The last two films have had none of the above. I can only say that I am glad the movie was made as some of the technical achievements during the filming are amazing.  But that's it.",3,0,4,16 December 2003
