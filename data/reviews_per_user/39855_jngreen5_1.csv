Skyfall," Skyfall
","Well, I have to say I was disappointed with Skyfall. I found it hard to connect with the characters and feel what they were feeling with is usually how I deem a movie worthy. I didn't feel that his usual suave relationship that he usually has with his female co-stars was there which to me is a big part of what makes James Bond who he is. Everyone seemed to be acting their part but something was missing. I never once felt on the edge of my seat or caught up in the moment. I don't think that Sam Mendes should really direct a movie with so much action and intrigue. But, in spite of this I'd still watch it again as I'm a huge Bond fan.",6,6,15,11 November 2012
