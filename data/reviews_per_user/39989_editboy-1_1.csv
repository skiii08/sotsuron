Sucker Punch," Had low expectations which this 'movie' exceeded
","This was a steaming turd which oozed paedo-nonsense from the screen.No matter how low my expectations are for a Zack Snyder eye-bortion, he finds a way to exceed them. The heartless misogyny, the creepy paedophilia, the terrible use of slow mo and the 'breathy ingenue sings a song really slow' (which was cool for about 10 minutes a decade ago) all add up to a symphony of sophomoric sewage.I bet even the craft services were terrible.Honestly, he must have dirt on any exec that greenlights his crap.",1,5,10,31 May 2017
