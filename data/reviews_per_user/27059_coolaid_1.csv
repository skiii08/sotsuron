The Blair Witch Project," Be afraid
","Forget about all those silly teen horror films of the past, its' time to be really scared. Imagine yourself lost in the woods with no food, two people you don't know, and not only are you cold but a supernatural legend is constantly following you and harrassing you. Would you be scared? you know I would. That is the case of the three young filmmakers in question, who mysteriously dissapear into the Black Hills of Maryland in their desperate attempt to film a documentary on the famed Blair Witch. Being as naive as they are (thanks to their bossy director Heather) they laugh at the warnings given to them by the locals they interview, including this insane lady, Mary Brown, and venture into the woods, never to be seen again, a few years later their equipment is found underneath an abandoned house in the middle of the woods, and thanks to Haxan Films, we see their tragic story unfold before our very eyes, is this footage real or is it a put on, well, you be the judge, I know the real answer. Just have fun watching this movie in a darkened theater with total strangers and witness it for yourself. You'll feel like you are really lost with these people and you'll become pretty attached to them as well. Once this film is over you will find it very hard to forget it, and you will definitely will not want to be alone in the dark or camp any time soon. Like I said, Be Afraid.",Null,1,2,29 May 1999
