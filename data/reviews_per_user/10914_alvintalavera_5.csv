Ford v Ferrari," One of the best.
","This is one of this year's best, from the cast's performance, the story, and the cinematography. It has good visuals feeling that you are really in the 60s. Bale and Damon's acting were commendable. I really did not expect to love this one a lot because I'm mainly not a fan of action movies. I expect this to be at least nominated for Oscars.",9,5,14,14 November 2019
Knives Out," Well written story and superb cast.
","I am a huge fan of mystery novels, but when it comes to films there isn't much to love. But this one came along. I really love the story, the cast itself is already likable, the acting is superb especially Daniel Craig and Chris Evans. The set is just amazing. Will definitely see this one again.",10,16,46,29 November 2019
Aladdin," Magical
","Surprisingly great, It still has the magic as same as the animated version. Great cast and production design, has a lot of comedic scenes too. Perfect for all ages.
Directed well by Guy Ritchie whose movies were some of my favorites like Sherlock Holmes and The Man From UNCLE.",7,5,18,22 May 2019
Midsommar," Midsummer Madness
","Very artsy one of a kind movie. I loved this one more than Hereditary. The whole film's cinematography and story is just perfect. This movie gives you a very weird, unsettling feeling after watching it which made me love this movie a lot.",10,11,20,24 July 2019
Parasite," One of 2019's best.
","Parasite (noun) - a person who habitually relies on or exploits others and gives nothing in return.This movie is one hell of a ride, it has a lot of unpredictable twists and turns which will make the viewers curious what will happen next. One of 2019's best. I loved the whole cast in this one.",10,24,49,14 August 2019
