Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," YEAH BABY
","If you are a Star Wars fan then you will love this movie, if you aren't a Star Wars fan (what's wrong with you) then you will love this movie.Please, don't listen to all the 'professional' critics and go to this movie looking to nick-pick every detail of it. Go to the movie, get some popcorn/pop and sit back and enjoy the fantasy world that Lucas immerses you into.Since we already know the future of most of the characters, it's interesting to pick up on the subtle hints that are referenced in the movie about said future.The only disappointing thing about the movie, is that Part II won't be out for a minimum of three years.",10,1,1,19 May 1999
American Pie," Great fun
","This movie definitely follows the great comedies about sexual mis-adventures in high school. I laughed so hard so many times it was great. If you don't like sexual humor stay away, but if you don't mind it or even love it, then you will think this is a great movie.",9,0,0,10 July 1999
American History X," Solid film that should get you thinking
","A excellent film about the portrayal of ignorance in the world of today. Like always, Norton plays his in the most superb manner. Be forewarned to all, this movie isn't just for entertainment, its a thought provoking drama of extreme proportions.",9,0,0,15 May 1999
Meet Joe Black," Made me wish I had three hours of my life back.
","This movie was awful. Why? I really can't explain that, I just didn't like it. The length of the movie was grossly long and the story was plain at best. I just didn't feel for characters and the ending was one of the most predictable and worst endings of all time. If I had paid to see this movie, I would consider myself a sucker.",3,1,3,1 June 1999
The Sixth Sense," Must-see
",Whats to say - Haley Joe got robbed of an oscar becuase like always the academy went with the sentimental favorite (see Santana winning every grammy he was up for).But this movie is awesome and you can see it multiple times and still enjoy it.,10,0,0,1 April 2000
A Night at the Roxbury," Hmmmm - okay I guess.
","Never having seen this skit on SNL the material was new to me and I found myself bored by it halfway through the movie. If you start watching this movie and expect nothing, then you will rewarded with exactly that. This is one of those movies that you will probably wind up watching late at night, simply because nothing else is on.",5,0,4,1 June 1999
