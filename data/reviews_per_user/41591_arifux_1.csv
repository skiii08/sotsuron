Changeling," Two Thumbs up for Clint Eastwood
","Ladies and gentleman we're in front of one of the greatest movie directors of the 21st century, I certainly cannot judge Clint for his acting, as I have not seen his movies, but as a director, this man has lots to offer, specially when there are hundreds of new movies and mostly no one has nothing to say. This movie features a brilliant performance of many of the actors involved, John Malkovich acts with excellence and transmits a lot of concern in every time he appears on the film, but that's not a surprise as he's one of the greatest actors we can enjoy, besides this performance, Jolie in amazing, and she shows herself as a really concerned and suffering mother, desperately looking for answers regarding what she loves the most, she doesn't overact at all, one thing to point out is that she usually performs a non sensitive sexy man eater, but in this film, from beginning to end, you can feel that she's a really sensitive painful mother. There's lots of great acting in the movie, Jeffrey Donovan does a great job as well as Jason Butler Harner, they definitely got into they're characters with passion . I just can say that this kind of movies are the ones that are worth watching, it's completely beautiful, to your eyes to your ears (wonderful music) and the most important of all. It's a deeply intense experience that will surely touch your heart.Just one more thing to say, and that's all, Thank you very much for your work Mr. Eastwood, I hope that your work inspire young directors and actors, by now you're for me one of the best drama directors of all times.",9,4,5,3 March 2009
