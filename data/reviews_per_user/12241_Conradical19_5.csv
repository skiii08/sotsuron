Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Seriously... The best comedy I have ever seen.
","This film will definitely not be appreciated by everyone but the irony is that there would be no comedy if it was.Sacha Baron Cohen is an extremely versatile actor which is shown perfectly by his other character's, Ali G and Bruno. He is the best actor I can think of because some people actually believe his character's to be real. This would make him the perfect undercover spy or journalist because he is able to manipulate people and expose their prejudices. Whereas, the prejudices Borat claims e.g. Antisemitism, homophobia, misogyny, racism are not ones that the actor shares. He is also Jewish himself which makes the Antisemitism part of the humour. This is what helps him to get away with the countless times he has been sued, even by an entire nation! However, what Kazakhstan fail to appreciate is that Borat has helped to put it on the map!The plot and the socially deviant stunts are cleverly conceived. There are very few people brave enough to do what Baron Cohen and Ken Davitian do in this movie which makes the film hilarious (Particularly the rodeo scene). Most of the narrative was made up as they went along and it must be very low budget which is skillful! The structure of it can be best described as a 'Mockumentary' because it's styled like a documentary which then becomes a Rom-com starring real, unsuspecting people.My film teacher told me that there are as many ways of interpreting a film as there are people who watch them and that our personal experiences shape this interpretation. My first experience of watching this film was managing to buy a ticket, with my friend, several months shy off 15 which made it a daring and unforgettable adventure in itself. The character is so unique that I still hear and use his quotes frequently. In order to enjoy this film, I suggest an open and tolerable mind in order to see the genius behind it as I have. Also, prepare to cringe at some parts.If you like this kind of film, I recommend Chris Morris' 'Four Lions', 'Jackass' and of course Ali G and Bruno. IT'Z NICE!",10,0,0,28 February 2011
Kick-Ass," Lives up to it's name.
","Personally, I found this film to be incredibly enjoyable and I really don't mean that in a sadistic sense.Firstly, the character, Kick-Ass (Aaron Johnson), is inspiring to me. He portrays a plausible teenage vigilante. He starts off very brave, tenacious, reasonable and truly heroic! I think my favourite scene is where he defends a victim from 3 thugs, in front of people and endures numerous hits (both physically and on Youtube). The scene works perfectly to the tune 'Omen' by The Prodigy and, in a way, the fight scene is an omen in the film.The film is similar to 'Hot Fuzz' because it starts off realistically, set in a world of selfish people, corruption and apathetic witnesses and yet only one guy is desperately trying to do the right thing. However, all hell breaks loose and both films end in a ridiculous and violent crescendo. Kick-Ass very rightly says, 'I'm way in over my head!'In contrast, Hit-Girl seems to be a character deliberately used to test the threshold for bad influence. The actress seemed far too young for the role. She even drops the C-bomb! She reminds me of Puss in Boots manipulating people by acting angelic then suddenly becoming a merciless but skillful assassin.It's great to see Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Red Mist, McLovin etc.) in this role and a very different Mark Strong (Mob-boss Frank) compared to Vaughn's other brilliant film, 'Stardust'. I think this film is very well directed and I love the way the plot played with my expectations many times. That was thoroughly enthralling!Also, I liked the intertextuality (film references) to other superhero movies like Spider-Man, X-Men and Nick Cage being similar to Batman.I think a 15 rating is OK but slightly pushing it. There are a few torture scenes including a particularly unpleasant one towards the end. But the film is still brilliant and I'm looking forward to the sequel. Fortunately, the area I live in doesn't need a super-hero as it's relatively peaceful. But I believe Kick-Ass when he says, everyone's fantasized about being a superhero. I'm not ashamed to admit that I have. However, this film proves that you don't need to be a mutant to be a super-hero. You just need to be a good character.",9,4,8,8 July 2011
A Beautiful Mind," A beautiful film
","What got me interested in this film was I was told it is about schizophrenia. I found it didn't spoil the plot for me though, in fact, it made it more enjoyable because I was easily manipulated. I was trying to understand throughout what it was that made the protagonist, John Nash (Crowe) schizophrenic. Then, when it gets to the point where it's made clearer, that's not the end of it! The rest of the film shows how he lives with the illness.This film starts off slow but it becomes a story of true love and determination. It answers the question, 'how do you get up from an all time low?' The ending almost brought a tear to my eye. One scene in particular is so tense, I nearly switched the film off! It just about made me shout aloud to the characters on screen. You will know what I'm on about when you see it. On the other hand, I do like Nash's chat-up lines. He's got more balls than me.The acting is flawless, especially from Russell Crowe. He is so different in this compared to his other films. His character in this is more vulnerable and fearful. The casting is very well done when showing the main characters growing old. I don't think they changed the actors either which is remarkable.As far as I know, this film is totally original and it's pretty realistic. Personally, I think it's far better than 'One flew over the Cuckoo's nest'. If you like this film, I recommend 'Shutter Island', the plot is unnerving but it has similar themes and it should manipulate you.That's the thing with this film though, it will be completely different watching it a 2nd time. I haven't watched it a 2nd time yet because I put most of the pieces together in my head afterwards. However, I'm sure it will still be an enjoyable film.",9,0,0,17 April 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Nolan has done it again with an incredibly scary and clever conclusion
","Admittedly I was never a fan of Batman. I found it too dark as opposed to the colourful and witty world of Marvel with it's heroes and villains. However, Chris Nolan has put commendable effort into vamping up the comic book legend. This was the first Batman film I saw in the cinema... And not just any cinema but the IMAX which was a spectacular experience! The unique selling point of the Imax I think is that it is simply the biggest screen you can watch a film on I think and I mean absolutely huge! It helps to take up the peripheral vision as well making it easier to get absorbed in the film, plus it's not a bad price. I highly recommend it!What I really like about Batman is that I never realised he was trained as a proper ninja! However, Batman has really met his match in this film, not just with the introduction of Catwoman but with Bane! Bane scares the hell out of me and the score by Hans Zimmer emphasizes that beautifully. The chanting is catchy and foreboding and the violins reach search unnerving frequencies, it literally made my skin tingle! I cannot believe Tom Hardy is Bane! The amount of weight he has put on for that role compared to his other recent films is unbelievable. He is unrecognisable as Bane but his poshness can still be distinguished in his voice. I know Hardy didn't intend on upstaging the memorable final performance of Heath Ledger being the previous Batman villain and renown nemesis but Bane has got to be one of the greatest villains in cinematic history. Even rivaling Darth Vader and John Williams classic score and that's coming from a die-hard Star Wars fan, although my parents think he resembles Hannibal rather. What makes these Batman films more scary is they have a hint of plausibility to them but the villains have destructive and complex ideologies and the characters have advanced technology. It is a great pity it has influenced the Aurora shooting.In the film, Bane goes from strength to strength cunningly holding an entire city hostage. He proves his worth in a gruelling fist fight with Batman. His past will intrigue and set up twists in the tale. He is utterly merciless. Expect brutal neck snapping, bone breaking, hanging corpses etc. It may derive from comic books but this is by no means a film for children. It should be a 15 if I'm honest. Also, children probably wouldn't be able to appreciate the politics behind it. Bane makes some wise remarks including one scene where he breaks into a stock exchange with his henchmen and a person working there says, 'This is a stock exchange. There's no money to steal here.' Bane simply responds, 'Why are you here then?' It's true! People go there to cheat the system and make or steal money. It's said something like 10% of population own 90% of everyone's wealth in real life. Also, Bane starts what is like a Marxist revolution by unleashing the prisoners and the poor upon the rich to evict, rob and kill them.All the characters have powerful roles in the film including Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman. It's nice to see Joseph Gordon-Levitt thrown into the mix as well. I notice Chris Nolan uses a similar cast to Inception. Even Michael Caine gets emotional but he is absent for most of the film. You'll no doubt be pleased to see Liam Neeson has a brief return in the film and makes a Taken reference which made me smile. He isn't the only character to return as well. Catwoman, skillfully played by Anne Hathaway, is very sexy and cunning but doesn't have much of a back story compared to the Tim Burton films. The narrative is so well directed, you don't know if any character, even Batman, is going to die! There is some love story elements in it as well which tug at the heart strings and strengthen the characters. Even Bane reveals a slight compassionate side but this in no way exonerates him. One thing I noticed though is that the main characters can't operate on their own, regardless of how powerful they are, they both require help.Overall, great directing, acting, music, narrative, action etc. It may be 3 hours in the cinema (including adverts) but it is well paced. The ending is satisfying and the hero's rise is triumphant, enough to make me throw my fists in the air which is what film is all about. Chris Nolan has really stamped his mark forever and although I hear rumours of more Batman, I have no idea how this will be topped.",9,5,11,12 August 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," A spellbinding ending to an unforgettable tale
","My 10/10 doesn't just go to this film but also the franchise and the books. With the 'Deathly Hallows', I chose not to read the book so it wouldn't spoil the film for me (that and I had A-Levels). It worked! Also, the extended trailer shows a lot of action and may spoil your film experience so it's best to watch that after the film, in my opinion. Despite the film being the last one, surprisingly I didn't feel sad at the credits.This final installment seemed to mention and explain the key parts of the story that were needed for the ending. However, I have read parts of the last books since watching the film and they are still really enjoyable to read. They provide more explanation with plot details. What annoyed me with some of the previous films (E.g. 'Order of the Phoenix') was that some important plot details were never mentioned; such as, why Harry must stay at the Dursley's until Voldemort is defeated. Whereas, other details were mentioned in later films to make up for the absence. It has been fairly obvious how each Director has imposed their own interpretation of the story and appearance in the films. Still, the books and the films together create a complete understanding of the story.Also, I've noticed that the films got progressively darker over the years and I don't just mean the plot (we all know that), I'm referring to the actual lighting. In the 'Half-Blood Prince' with the fight scene in the toilets, the scene is virtually black and white. Even the sunlight in some scenes has this golden tinge rather than bringing out the colour in everything else.Interestingly, this final part also puts a focus on the fear of dying. The book has at the very beginning 2 poems about death. There is a flashback scene in the film that is perhaps the most powerful scene because it is such a revelation. Even Dumbledore speaks some wisdom but he shows a slight dark side as well (It's remarkable how similar he is to Gandalf in 'Lord of the Rings'). At first, after Richard Harris died, I was sceptical of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore but over the series, he fit into the role, allowing me to take Dumbledore more seriously.Furthermore, some of the side characters had really prominent parts in this final film. McGonagal, Molly Weasley, The Malfoys and especially Snape and Nevelle. Hagrid not so much. Nevelle has changed so much over the franchise, physically as well as characteristically. He is very heroic and gives a cliché yet well-spoken speech in front of everyone in the film. Snape also plays a completely different character to the one we know. Alan Rickman plays him perfectly in my opinion. I love the way he puts emphasis into every word he speaks.The film is also pretty action packed throughout and gets started immediately, even before the title shows. I like the sneaking behind enemy lines aspect in the films. My friend was disappointed that the centaurs were not featured in this one. However, I was pleased that the duel was beefed out for the crescendo rather than just the simple connection of wands that we had already seen in 'Goblet of Fire'. There was even some cheeky slapping going on! The showdown was all the more satisfying that Voldemort was clearly peeved off. You can tell things are gonna kick-off.On the other hand, there didn't seem to be much 3D effects. The latest 3D shows best when there are tiny things floating around in the scene, such as ash. It's up to you whether or not to watch it in 3D. I guess it is the last chance to.Another thing I like about 'Harry Potter' is that it is British. There are so many American films (don't get me wrong, most of them are great!) but it's nice to have one that makes use of our landmarks and employs a fantastic British cast and crew, thus helping the country's reputation.I think what made 'Harry Potter' more enjoyable, for me, was that I grew up with the characters. I could equate with their teenage angst and relationships and schooling. I can't say the same for what it feels like to lose parents and be hunted by psychopaths at a young age though, thank God! The narrative has always conveyed good morals and a fierce battle between good and evil. For all that Harry has suffered, he remains not to be a vengeful character. This film, just like most of the others, is a perfect blend of action, wit, romance, horror and fantasy, enough to give a lasting emotional enjoyment that films are meant to provoke. Even if this film wasn't that good, It would still be watched in order to complete the story.J.K. Rowling has created such a fascinating wizarding world which I'm sure leaves a possibility for developing more wonderful stories, despite this story being called, 'Harry Potter'. It certainly makes a refreshing change to the countless films containing guns. I don't think a new story can be as great as 'Harry Potter' but I'm up for it regardless.",10,0,0,17 August 2011
