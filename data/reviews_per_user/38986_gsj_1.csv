Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The critics need to lighten up. It's Star Wars, not Last Year at Marienbad.
","Critics, critics, lighten up.  This is Star Wars.  Criticize Lucas because his computer generated characters are as engaging (or more so?  not for me) as the flesh and blood ones?  That's an accomplishment, not a mistake! Criticize Yoda's dialogue?  It's Yoda for heaven's sake!  Rubber he is and fun was meant to be.  What is up here--critic's afraid to like the movie because that wouldn't be cool?  They're like fish--all turning in the same direction at the same time.Okay, this movie is not cerebral.  Its big and engaging and most of all, its like visiting old friends and looking through their old photo albums.  The audience I sat with was definitely amped just to be there and everyone thought it was worth the admission price and then some.Here are my criticisms:  The Trade Federation sneak attack planners seem to have Japanese accents and Jar Jar is like some weird mutant Amos 'n Andy meets Cool Runnings guy.  Although they are great characters, they smack of racial stereotypes.  Jar Jar's big boss is an awful lot like my memories of the Kingfish.  Odd, and maybe I'm the only one who noticed.Overall, this movie is great.  And anyone who doesn't think so is obviously an effete snob!  (Just kidding).",9,0,0,20 May 1999
