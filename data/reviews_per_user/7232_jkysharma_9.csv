Frost_Nixon," Only one of us can win
","'Those who heard me on radio thought I'd already won. I lost the 1960 elections because of perspiration on my brow and above my lips' says Nixon prior to the start of the interview. Alluding to one of the most celebrated events in the history of television (the televised debates between Kennedy and Nixon before the 1960 Presidential Elections), the lines ram home the idea that it might be worthwhile going out of the way to project an image of confident repose rather than banking entirely on content. This is one of the major purports of the film - the impressions that images on television make on people and what they make of the same. Based on Peter Morgan's (writer for Frost/Nixon, The Queen, The Last King of Scotland) 2006 play of the same name, and featuring the same leads, the film portrays the events lacing the famed 1977 interviews of Richard Nixon by British talk show host David Frost. As the title indicates quite literally, it was make or break for the two - Nixon seeking to salvage his reputation and rebuild on his political career while earning dough from the same (he was offered $ 600,000 + 20 % of the profits) and Frost trying to further his career. In the lead-up to the interview, two men with contrasting personalities and world-views are portrayed in their bid to deal with the upcoming event. The paradox is summed up by a Nixon line towards the end when he asks Frost if he enjoys all those parties he gives. At Frost's yes, Nixon remarks, 'You have the gift then. Of liking people. Being liked by people. This facility. I never had it'. In etching out this contrast, the narrative avoids being primarily about Nixon in a calculative yet regretful phase. As it is, Nixon is easily the most compelling political figure of modern times and a movie that has anything to do with him will inescapably veer towards the irony of it all. With a portrayal like the one Frank Langella has fleshed out here, the other aspects of the film are very nearly overshadowed.Michael Sheen as Frost is all ambition and balance. The support cast delivers (with the possible exception of a miscast Matthew Macfadyen) - Kevin Bacon does his reliable, steady-as-a-rock confidante, Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell provide the counterpoints to Frost's liberalism. Toby Jones as the enterprising agent who arranges the deal is the stand-out supporting performance. Rebecca Hall's Caroline Cushing isn't merely eye-candy, it furthers the contrast between the leads - Frost is able to juggle and balance out quite a few things at a time. Ron Howard (director) steers the film clear of the play-like feel that other films with origins in successful plays (Closer) couldn't avoid. Only later on does it develop such a feel, at a juncture where the movie depends on the tete-a-tete between Sheen and Langella. Peter Morgan may have had a lot to do with the framing of the structure of the narrative. If it is so, then his established credentials as a playwright and screenwriter have been enhanced further.Peppered with wit and political satire, there is something in the fact that this film aims more at amusing than raising any serious questions about the role of media or even in portraying the Frost - Nixon interviews as watershed events in the history of media and journalism. For what Frost manages to extract from Nixon during the last bout of the interview is not so much a confession to the world but a confession to the self and Frost isn't motivated by concerns that involve filtering out the truth. In an expected turn, he comes to sympathize with the man in the spotlight and is appreciative of the mettle it takes to make an admission of guilt. This event did not open up a new means for investigative journalism and mass media to ally against corruption at the highest level; indeed, there have hardly been other coups of a similar nature since then. Howard and Morgan, knowing this, have shied away from making it out to be an epoch-making event of sorts of the last half a century. Instead we have, as mentioned earlier, a portrait of contrasts and an acknowledgement of the impressionistic role of television.",8,1,2,6 June 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Once Upon A Time ...
","There is homage and there is indulgence. With Pulp Fiction, Tarantino probably ran out of material that stands on its own. Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction share this quality (How much of what I've to call restraint, in hindsight, owes its existence to Roger Avary?). From Jackie Brown onwards, the 'did you get that? that's supposed to be his tribute to ...' aspect of his films have been given a free reign. From the amount of polarization that's evident in what movie-goers have to say on the web, it's possible to discern a kind of weariness in the writings of both parties - the ones that do 'get' it and the others who don't. A begrudging acknowledgment of the divide. Personally speaking, no matter what the levels of indulgence, Tarantino makes movies that entertain, eventually. There are long scenes of seemingly rambling dialogue (dotingly dubbed verbal diarrhoea by some) but their denouement, I nearly always find satisfying. The kind of satisfaction it gives can border upon the crass more often than not but it works. That brings me to something along the lines of the suspension-of-disbelief concept. How much indulgence would I permit Tarantino in return for the kind of entertainment he offers? This is the question that ranks above all else when it comes to his films since Jackie Brown. In this regard, Jackie Brown paid homage to a kind of cinema almost totally unfamiliar to me and I found the entertaining parts - Robert De Niro in a unique performance (even by his standards) and the mall sequence - not sufficient in exchange for the indulgence. Kill Bill Volumes 1 and 2 had tributes that I'm not readily familiar with but enjoyable in their exposition. It had enough of his brilliance with dialogue and action to keep me glued and coming back for repeat views of segments. Death Proof proved to be another unfair exchange - two riveting sequences amidst endlessly droll dialogue and B-movie homage. Inglourious Basterds is just the right mix of campy dialogue, intrigue, character elements, action and homage, tribute, indulgence.There's a difference here. Unlike other Tarantino films where every pillar is integral but dispensable, Inglourious Basterds owes a lot to Christoph Waltz's Hans Landa. It wouldn't be the same without his prying, inquisitive manner with a prim and proper veneer to mask a deep- rooted sense of inferiority. In other words, Tarantino films don't have one performance that hogs the limelight but this one does. Akin to David Carradine in Kill Bill, you're left wondering why such actors haven't been in the spotlight. It's only the chapter technique that prevents Waltz from completely stealing the show from the rest of the cast which is just as competent as he is - Mélanie Laurent, Til Schweiger (what he achieves with the most minimal of screen time!), Diane Kruger (whose German roots help), Eli Roth, Daniel Brühl and Brad Pitt.By choosing the setting and the narrative that he has, Tarantino has allowed himself maximum leeway in terms of the homage quotient. World War II saw propagandist cinema sore to great heights with Dr Goebbels (unique among the sycophants in history) and Leni Reifenstahl (Berlin Olympics). And since the setting involves France ('we respect our directors'), it isn't outrageous to have a plot revolve around cinema itself. This has a cheesy yet old worldly heroic appeal to it - if you want a testament to the power of cinema, this would be it.Lastly, the subtitles (large parts of the film are in German and French with a smattering of the Italian) suggest inventiveness. Deliberate insertions like 'somebody over there's wife' and 'impertinentness' hint at the possibility of greater enjoyment if one is familiar with these three languages.",8,1,7,4 July 2010
Public Enemies," On a high
","The most awaited film of the year, Public Enemies, is a Michael Mann crime film. None among his peers are as adept at making crime dramas (with a particular tendency towards bank heists) as Mann. With films like Manhunter, Heat and Collateral Mann has established himself as a master of this genre. His latest, Public Enemies harks back to the time of the 1931-34 crime wave at its peak during the Depression Era, now dubbed the Public Enemy Era.A discussion of the film hinges entirely on two novelties here. Filmed with a High Definition camera (Dante Spinotti), the cinematography alternates between whirlwinds of activity - almost as if trying to keep track of the heady and adrenaline-filled periods in the lives of John Dillinger and the other Public Enemies, and shots of the principal characters from close quarters, again coming across as attempts to gain admission. The second stems from the fact that Mann's film is based on a non-fiction book Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-34 by Brian Burrrough. It shows. The play of events on screen feels factual. The drama is very much present but lacks the choices-conflicts-decisions that made Heat and Collateral memorable, partly because the characters here are historical and we know what eventually happened to each of them. They are novelties for sure. A step forward for cinema in that this can serve as a model for dramatizing whilst documenting slices of history. As a result though, the nature of the participatory viewing the movie elicits is primarily of a technical nature, an invitation to be part of the ride. This has its bearing on every other aspect of the film.The leads Johnny Depp and Christian Bale are perfect for their parts. Depp's John Dillinger is as steeped in fact as the film itself and benefits considerably from the tone of the film, designed to make the audience react to his character in much the same way that America did. The role requires him to be a star on-screen and fully conscious of it. A suave Depp pulls this off with aplomb; his every exploit is achieved with a swagger. That he fleshes out the other aspects of Dillinger is credit both to him and the script. Bale meanwhile, adds his reliability to the film, playing Melvin Purvis in a manner that isn't as straight- forward as seems. It is a consummate performance from an actor whose portrayals never overshadow his films and who seems to be an ace with accents, both traits prevalent here. Marion Cotillard is a different proposition from her turn in La Vie En Rose. In keeping with the Mann tradition, a supporting cast is well picked and delivers performances that don't sink with the weight of the leads. Elliot Goldenthal, whose score for Heat garnered praise, captures the thrill of the heists and the getaways. However, the score suffers from banality when the narrative lapses into drama.Ultimately, Public Enemies' experimental nature makes it difficult for it to be judged completely now. In all likelihood, it might turn out to be a film that grows with time with certain aspects gaining greater acceptance in the future. I'm tempted to say bravo Mann.",8,0,0,4 July 2010
Revolutionary Road," Winslet & DiCaprio
","Sam Mendes' latest offering is, at long last, an adaptation of Richard Yates' book of the same name. I've heard a lot about his book (haven't read it) and would have thought that it merited a scramble for the production rights. Having seen the movie, I can't wait to read it. At a time when there seems to be a paucity for good scripts in Hollywood, a film about personal struggles and showcasing the monotony of daily life is a rarity. This has to be right up there with the best of the films on the 'American Dream', shown in its stagnation nevertheless. Reading up on the praise showered by contemporaries and critics alike on Yates' book, the magnitude of the task dawned upon me and anyone will acknowledge that it takes a team like this to do justice to the source material. It does, with some members of the cast walking away with the laurels, none more so than Kate Winslet.To say that she stands at the apex of her profession, unchallenged, would not be stating too much. Her April Wheeler is passionate, constantly challenging the fabric of stillness that overhangs the setting and the one person in the film who harbors the founding thought of the United States – hope. Watching her during the silent moments of the film is an exercise in getting floored repeatedly. In an inspired piece of casting, Leonardo DiCaprio plays April's man Frank. Representative of men from a time when everybody craved a security blanket, here is an actor at the top of his craft and still getting better.This film also completes a circle of sorts for the two. In the interim between Titanic (1997) and Revolutionary Road (2008), their careers have been fulfilling for the actors and fans alike. Together here, they make for immensely compelling viewing.Michael Shannon as John Givings is the surprise package of the film and I couldn't help thinking of 'One flew over the cuckoo's nest', another quintessentially American film. In the sense that, if he's crazy, it's only because they say so. Also, it probably takes an out-of-the-box thinker to comprehend April and Frank's plans. Another performance worth treasuring for it doesn't get much of screen time.Mendes brings his gift for ushering a sense of balance to proceedings and making it look natural. This may not turn out to be as memorable for him as American Beauty but the movie is all the better for it. Thomas Newman's score, the costumes by Albert Wolsky and the art direction by Debra Schutt and Kristi Zea add considerably to the film.This one kept me awake for a while after the credits had rolled. This particular representation of the American Dream may not be relevant any more but the themes of conformity, loneliness and frustration hold true.",9,0,0,6 June 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Button up or Button down ?
","There have been films that have had their protagonists relive the defining moments of their lives on their deathbeds. 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' adds a fresh clause to the aphorism that 'lives reflected upon are lives fully lived'. Would the experience be more fulfilling if relived by a person aging backwards ? David Fincher and Brad Pitt team up for the third time (Se7en, Fight Club) for this loose adaptation of Scott Fitzgerald's short story. As with the earlier films, the result is nothing short of brilliant. Using the ingenious device of a recollection within a recollection to enhance the rapport the audience has with the characters, the movie traces vignettes from the lives of Daisy (Cate Blanchett) and Benjamin (Brad Pitt), two people whose lives are inter-twined in a manner that has them in nearly every conceivable facet of love. It helps then that this is a pair that genuinely understand each other as actors and that their previous outing - Babel, featured a harrowing journey for the couple that eventually strengthened their bond. Their screen vibes form the crux of the film. Through them, the film examines a number of themes ranging from the human obsession with physical appearances to the idea that some bonds defy the most long-standing establishments. In that regard, the casting of Pitt and Blanchett with their matchless lines and physical grace makes perfect sense. Pitt, in particular, leaves no doubt as to why it has to be him as Benjamin and nobody else. With a deserved Oscar nod, his no-hassles acceptance of his peculiar condition is the highlight of the film. That it holds its own amidst the fantastic work by the make-up department is testimony to the performance.Giving them great company are Taraji Henson as Queenie, Tilda Swinton as Elizabeth Abbott and Jared Harris as Captain Mike. Many performances, short albeit, deserve a mention but these are the three that stick with you. Straddling the performances is technical wizardry of a kind and degree that doesn't come as a surprise to anyone who is familiar with Fincher's style. So much so that some of his fervent critics have pointed out that this aspect of his films often takes priority over the human concerns that the script raises. His work here is a triumphant no. There is style but it never glosses over substance. If anything, the former accentuates the latter, be it the montage demonstrating the purpose of the 'anticlockwise' clock, the sepia drenched visuals or the narrative technique for the Paris segment.The sheer variety of visuals lingers long after the viewing. Theodore Roosevelt ('I wish I had had a war to fight during my presidency') taking his hat off at the stated purpose of the 'anticlockwise' clock, Daisy's ballet performance in New York, the U-boat sequence, the Hummingbird fluttering on the hospital window. Ultimately, it's the fact that a film that could so easily have become what the title suggests, merely a curious case, instead goes on to strike a chord with audiences. That is its biggest triumph.",9,1,3,6 June 2009
A Hard Day's Night," Then you can start // to make it better
","'Are you a mod or a rocker?' is the question. The reply - 'I'm a mocker'. That's A Hard Day's Night for you. A ninety-minute sneak peek at the lives of The Beatles, it showcases, quite literally the trappings of fame. The Lads from Liverpool are ensconced into one enclosed space after the other echoed in this line by the four to the scriptwriter Alun Owen – 'a room and a car and a room and a car and a room and a car'. Any moment in the interim is construed, by fans as the opportune moment for a tryst with the four, and by the four themselves as a chance to breakaway, indulge in a bit of fun.The film has a nice flow to it; the fun is scattered. Slapstick is thrown in too but much of the humour is a gentle mockery of the fame of the Beatles. A cavalier Lennon is stopped by a fan who says he looks just like John Lennon. When the Beatle doesn't aver she changes her mind! Paul McCartney comes across as the more concerned of the quartet while Ringo is the wandering soul. I couldn't get a fix on Harrison but this is the sell: one feels as if the four are very familiar. Richard Lester (director) has shown them in a very agreeable light; they come across as immensely likable and unassuming chaps, handling fame and mania with ease.For a part-documentary-part-burlesque, the film is incredibly well shot. It's one of those cinematographic exploits that ram home the elegance and striking quality of Black and White. Be it the close-ups or the Beatles' antics or the sheer madness of the wild goose chases, Gilbert Taylor does a fine job and it pays off – you're never really bored inspite of there being no discernible story or narrative convention. The visuals arrest you then and there, keeping one engaged.And then there are the songs. Taking off with A Hard Day's Night some of the picks of the track for me were I Should Have Known Better, Can't Buy Me Love, And I Love Her. Every one of them a chart-topper and hugely influential. None more so than the finishing piece, the frenzied She Loves You. A snapshot in all, of that time when the Beatles ruled and this was only the beginning.",Null,0,2,4 July 2010
The Wrestler," Rourke
","Watching 'The Wrestler' makes it clear as to why Mickey Rourke was rated so highly at the turn of the nineties. Even with a film-maker of Darren Aronofsky's abilities at the helm, this is Rourke's film. In fact, having seen some Aronofsky's previous work (Pi, Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain), it's clear that he's modified his approach to suit the story and Rourke's portrayal of Randy 'The Ram' Robinson, a former wrestling champion reduced to doing gallery stunts for fans. Adopting a unique approach to filming, Aronofsky has the camera literally follow Rourke almost all the time. Over the course of the film, the audience is more or less 'behind' the character. The space he provides for the film's characters to interact recalls 'Requiem for a Dream'; Rourke's attempts to connect with Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) and his daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood) don't require slices of the past getting a mention in the conversations. Their meetings have a familiar ring, making it seem as though these are not the first of his attempts to reconnect with them.Marisa Tomei brings a touch of understanding to her role, that of a stripper with a heart. It's been done many a time before but there's a grace to this performance that makes an impression, the way it complements Rourke's interest in her. Which brings me to Rourke's performance. I don't know if it's the eerie parallels that the character graph has with his own career (as a professional boxer and actor), but the amount of vulnerability Rourke projects here goes far beyond the routine 'macho, gruff men with a heart of gold' that Hollywood usually throws up. Rourke really inhabits the character here, willing to give him second chances and essentially presenting alternately, a self-forgiving and unapologetic aspect, that his final act comes across not as a rejection of all things outside the wrestling world but more as an acceptance of the fact that he simply does not know anything else and it is too late to attempt to learn.On the whole, I've had to reconsider my attitude towards wrestling as a sport. I've always thought of it as a sham and not worth the attention that the other sports deserve. Not that this film makes me want to start watching it with interest but it's broken all misconceptions on my part regarding the people who take part in it. Going by this film alone, wrestlers are sports-persons in their own right.",10,1,2,6 June 2009
Sherlock Holmes," The Adventure of the Ritchie deduction
","Ritchie's latest marked a return to the cinemas for me after a gap of three months, longer than any gap I recall. As a result, I'm inclined to look at the nicer aspects of this flick. And there are many if one can discern the intent behind the making of Sherlock Holmes. For starters, it's Guy Ritchie. A O Scott's (of NYT) observation is bang on - his approach to films is 'to make cool movies about cool guys with cool stuff'. Also, he seems to have a hold over London's sub-culture. Snatch and Lock Stock ... aren't cult films for nothing. They are intended to be precisely that. In his gravitating towards Holmes, I sense primarily an opportunity to milk the considerable London ethos that pervades throughout Doyle's work. Permit the brief digression but this is crucial to Holmes' (still unquestioned) exalted position in detective fiction. Poirot and his like do not preside over a criminal setting anywhere near as compelling. Only Maigret's Paris (grossly overused) comes remotely close. London represents a veritable treasure-trove of literary and cinematic possibilities and Ritchie makes considerable use of the latter. From Piccadilly Circus to the Tower of London, landmarks abound. It was particularly gratifying to watch sequences that weave their way through the alleys and lanes - most distinctive of London, and Holmes.There's a cue for the viewer in the manner in which Ritchie goes about extracting the maximum from London. He does the same with every aspect of the film from the performances to the plot. In short, every ounce of cinematic potential has been squeezed from the material. So Holmes' modest claims to an understanding of Bartitsu are developed into full- blown martial arts exploits. Watson is hinted as being a bit of a ladies' man in the books and voilà, Jude Law (competent) is cast, albeit with the necessary changes to his exterior. Far from being a mere accompaniment, Watson is very nearly indispensable to Holmes. Likewise, Lestrade is a nincompoop and Mrs Hudson in addition to being a super- efficient housekeeper, is also frankly expressive of her disbelief at Holmes' antics ('Some folk might say there was madness in his method'). Irene Adler and Sherlock Holmes have a fling (the limitless possibilities of 'To Sherlock Holmes, she is always the woman' !). Only here they make the one patent mistake of the movie. A femme fatale and a thief acting under Moriarty's orders is stretching it a bit and Rachel McAdams doesn't help either. The less said about the disservice done to Mark Strong in terms of character scripting the better.Ultimately, the flick is probably meant to be seen as a caper and plays out as one. Ritchie (like many others) probably wants to do a Bond movie. So he's indulged himself here with many elements that are a mark of that franchise. About Robert Downey Jr. then. His turn here is in keeping with all the above. The rapport he establishes with Law is the pillar of the film and is testimony to the skill of the actors. No matter how askew his take on a trait of the ace detective, the performance never loses credibility and most importantly, isn't an all- revealing act. It feels as if he has restrained himself and that leaves him with a lot in terms of options to exercise in the forthcoming films. I think he can build upon this if the possibility of a series were to emerge (as such a second is a given).And do remain seated for the exquisitely well crafted credits.",7,2,3,4 July 2010
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Penélope Cruz
","There are about a handful of film-makers whose influence on their films is unmistakable. Woody Allen defines this group and among Americans, only Martin Scorsese's influence is as pervading. This makes it hard to speak about Allen's films without his views on life, death and relationships getting more than a passing mention. Having seen only one prior to Vicky Cristina (Annie Hall), I'll stay away from reflections on that. A few things struck me. One of them was the way Barcelona was shot (Vicky is seduced by Barça, Juan Antonio is representative of the moods the city brings out in her). Excuse the digression, but Spanish Guitar ! How convenient ! The cinematographer (a chap with a wonderfully cinematic name Javier Aguirresarobe) and Allen capture, not merely the sights of Barcelona, but also the charming homes (villas had to be a Spanish term), cafés and cobbled, undulating roads. It feels as if Barca is both seductress and seduced. All the characters in the film are in love with it and the resultant effect on the viewer is a seduction that lasts about hundred minutes.The other seduction was Penélope Cruz. She does a Maria Elena that nearly overshadows everything else about the film. It is in Allen's understanding of what her character signifies to the trio that this is avoided. Her portrayal is more poetry than prose. The beauty, grace and poise of it is bewitching which makes the irrationality of her condition vexing, and annotates our interest in her character. If Spain is anything like Maria Elena, then it is worth savouring. Javier Bardem's Juan Antonio is the bedrock of the film. The only way in which I can say anything about the performance is in the assurance of his juggling act.Strangely, some of the film's pitfalls lie with Vicky and Cristina. Where there ought to be shades, Allen gives us diametric opposites. This, for me, is an easy way out on the part of film-makers. I guess it makes the character scripting process all the more easier. Despite that the contrasts are a little too gaudy here and muted colours could've given scope for multiple viewings. The real issue is in its germination to the voice over which, plainly put, should've been scrapped. It robs the film of a subtle touch, or a hidden hand rather. Ultimately, the performances from Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson hold our attention and keep it from straying too much. Rebecca Hall, in particular, is every bit the revelation that people have made her out to be.",8,2,4,4 July 2010
