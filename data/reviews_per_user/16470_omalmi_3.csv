The Hangover," lowbrow humour for teens
","Ridiculous storyline, hokey pranks, a film littered with racist, sexist and homophobic slurs, low-brow humour, all American boys-will-be-boys white trash. A movie of excess, celebrating bad behaviour. An American remake of the three musketeers. Seeing some sorry elderly man's bare behind in the doctor's office is supposed to be hilarious? Like, ewwww, gross, eh! I really don't know why I stayed until the end. It was just one far-fetched, over the top, ridiculous prank piled over another. It gave me indigestion. Spoiler alert* And what about that vintage Mercedes, we never saw dad's appreciation of the shape the car came back in, did we? And really, the dentist was going to return to Vegas to buy that stripper a nice dinner and take her out on a friendly date ? Right, IT WAS JUST A MOVIE, lighten up eh?",1,2,3,25 January 2016
Call Me by Your Name," Lyrical perfection !
","A slow moving ode to first loves, discovery of self, youth and summer. The lush setting, the beautiful cinematography, the quiet, thoughtful direction, the endearing characters, the mesmerizing performances, Sufjan Stevens's haunting music. There is nothing to critique about this movie, which is quite faithful to Aciman's novel. Oh, if we could only all live in a world where no one behaves badly? This film moved me to tears and it will remain in my heart forever. Let's hope there will be a sequel : )",10,3,6,11 January 2020
Inside Llewyn Davis," Left wanting much more
","I figure there's something wrong about a movie when your heart tugs most for the fate of a cat. While this film was beautifully cast and shot, with superb cinematography and great 60's era music and art direction, I was left thirsting for some real emotional connection to the main characters. I found the script, the story, to be wanting. Perhaps some great bits were left on the cutting room floor (an Akron Ohio reunion ? the royalties from the Kennedy song ? the future of Jean's relationship ?) Too many threads from the story were left unexplored and unresolved, imho. Hardly best picture material, despite the lovely audio-visual experience it provided.",6,4,7,30 December 2013
