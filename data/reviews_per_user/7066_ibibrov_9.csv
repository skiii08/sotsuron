Ford v Ferrari," 9.5/10 One of the best movies of the year.. except for that ending
","Ford V Ferrari was an experience..this is what cinema, true cinema, is, wonderment, excitement, laughter, emotion, and just that 'How in the hell did they make that?' question in your mind. This movie is spell-binding, heart-pounding, mesmerizing, pulsing with energy, and I was unable to even look at my phone for more than 2 seconds. The actors were phenomenonal, Bale, as always, a force of nature, the man can do no wrong. But Matt Damon, and Jon Bernthal were amazing too, and the incredibly well written dialogue, especially the chemistry and relationship between Bale and Damon, is both hilarious, beautiful, and real. The cinematography, soundtrack, unbelievable sound design, flawless direction all merge together and create truly incredible scenes..you feel the car vibrating, changing gear, speeding, braking, it's glorious. But then there's the ending, which, I guess, was too sad for me, even though it was still real, and emotional, and all that, I needed a happy ending. Still, this is one of the finest movies of the year, and pretty much a masterpiece, so I will rate Ford V Ferrari a 9.5/10",10,1,2,1 February 2020
Hereditary," Truly disturbing movie, with great performances and extreme tension
","An extremely tense, and very disturbing movie, half drama, and half, very, very scary horror, I can't say I enjoyed this movie exactly, but the great performances, and riveting buildup kept it going. Great movie 8/10",8,1,1,6 May 2020
12 Monkeys," A movie that gets better with each viewing
","This is a truly great piece of cinema, with superb, intelligent writing, great directon and cinematography, which tackles the issue of time travel like rarely before, accompanied by some of the best performances I've seen recently, every now and then punctured with hilarious humor, the movie constantly balancing between strangely creepy and funny. This movie puts you right in there, making you question your own sanity at times, while the movie jumps between times and flashbacks. Even the music score is perfectly fitting, strangely light-hearted, and ominous, blending a truly unique soundtrack. The ending was perfect, mind-bending, yet perfectly logical too, sad yet also hopeful. I love this movie and I might actually give it a full 10 after I've seen it a coupla times..for now tho 9/10",9,2,2,24 January 2020
The Irishman," A Love Letter to Cinema from the real artists
","Scorcese hast once again created an incredible, complex, slow-burning, melancholy movie, filled with masterful dialogue, from an-all star cast of our favourites from long ago, when cinema wasn't flooded with cheap marvel movies, propelled only by wise-assery and obvious political messages..these actors give it their all, while Scorsese directs the complicated narrative with ease, making a mature movie, for a mature audience, where the majority of the runtime is filled with dialogue, which is why the writing needed to be excellent, and it really is..the cinematography is spectacular, the atmosphere is unbelievable. No weird feminists, no filtered crap, just passion and mastery in perfect harmony..we need more movies like this..9/10",9,1,4,30 November 2019
The Exorcist," Old, but definitely still Gold
","I'm not easily shook or scared by horror movies, except of course, the two Conjuring Movies. On a whim, I decided to watch this movie as well, as I'd always known of this horror classic. And I can't say I was disappointed. Even all these years later, it's still seriously, seriously freaky, even though I can't say I was as terrified or legitimately scared as I was with the conjuring movies, however The Exorcist still packs a huge punch, especially in the age of practical effects, no CGI or anything modern we take for granted, and yet it still manages to be far more effective than most of the horror movies we see nowadays. The possession of the little girl is actually disturbing, with some truly freaky moments, which were met with gasps. The ending was a little abrupt, and mildly confusing, but nothing obnoxious. Also I would have loved some more backstory on the demon, but I also realize that that would have been a little difficult to incorporate, especially as this movie was a step into the unknown, and the first true horror movie, after which every movie in the genre borrowed something. I really love this movie, and I give it a 9/10.",9,0,0,25 January 2020
Twilight," Surprisingly decent
","Is this movie flawed? Definitely..is it also pretty cool, with pretty sweet scenes, albeit decidedly teenagery at times? Also, yes..Pattinson was great in this role, although of course, nowhere near as good as his performance in The Lighthouse, where he truly shines..he manages to be both brooding and moody one minute, then funny and vulnerable the next. It's definitely better than most romance movies nowadays, at least it's got properly male and female characters, and not some feminist . on the whole I was quite entertained through most of its runtime, and that's good enough for me...",7,1,5,14 November 2019
1917," This is what Art looks like..
","1917 is art. It's that simple. It's art. From the opening shot to the last, not one second is boring, or unnecessary, or anything less than masterful. The horrors and beauty of war are all expertly shown, without feeling sentimental or cliche in any way, which was an achievement in its own. The cinematography was, obviously, a true marvel, with a gorgeous soundtrack to accompany this composition of cinema. The story switches seamlessly from loud, intense, and anxiety inducing, to quiet, reflective, and almost tender at times. 1917 is to WWI what Saving Private Ryan was to WWII, and is one of the best movies ever made. I can't lie, with the majority of movies and shows nowadays being absolute trash, like the new marvel movies, or shows like Batwoman, it is movies like this that still give me hope, that there will always still be some directors and writers that actually care about telling a story, without feminism or sjw nonsense to get in the way. This memorizing composition is a true work of art, and I give it a full 10/10 stars.",10,0,1,14 March 2020
The King," Beautiful, sorrowful, realistic, gritty, haunting
","A beautifullly shot and directed movie, with incredible cinematography, acting, and atmosphere, and quite honestly, one of the best films of the year so far, it's depressingly realistic, and cinematically gorgeous at the same time, I loved this movie..",9,2,4,8 November 2019
Joker," An Incredible piece of Cinema
","Where the hell do I start? The incredible performance, one of the best of the decade? The gorgeous, lush cinematography, the haunting, spine-tingling music score, the masterful writing or direction? The chilling intelligence and skill at creating a narrative both relevant, and bleak, without having a political Agenda to stick down your throat..a mind-blowing, mature character study, that I would recommend to any intelligent adult..a cult classic..10/10",10,2,7,11 January 2020
