Alien 3," Ripley's Believe It or Not!
","'Alien 3' is the third of four films based on the alien theme starring Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. This one was filmed in the UK and was directed by David Fincher. At the close of 'Aliens' (1986) Ripley escapes the alien attacks along with the little girl 'Newt' and Cpl. Hicks and what's left of the android Bishop. 'Alien 3' opens as the shuttle carrying them separates from the mother ship and lands on, of all places, a penal colony. Only Ripley survives and Bishop is relegated to the garbage. Ripley discovers that she is the only female on the colony. She is befriended and ultimately bedded by the colony doctor, Clemens (Charles Dance). She begins to suspect that there may have been a stowaway aboard her shuttle. She hooks up the remains of Bishop (Lance Henriksen) and learns that indeed one of the alien creatures had been aboard. Then the carnage starts. One by one the convicts begin to disappear. The rest organize under Dillon (Charles S. Dutton) and with Ripley set about to destroy the creature. And as luck would have it, there are no weapons in the colony.
 Blood and guts literally abound in this movie. Rather than build the suspense as the two previous films had done, this one is wall to wall violence. It's sort of a Friday the 13th in outer space. Mind you it is well done if you like gratuitous violence. Director Fincher does save a couple of surprises for us at the end. It's another of Ripley's Believe It or Not adventures.",6,0,2,12 September 2003
The Sound of Music," True Classic Family Entertainment!
","'The Sound of Music' is one of the best musicals ever filmed. It deservedly won the Best Picture Oscar for 1965 along with a number of other awards. Filmed largely on location in Austria, the scenery is simply breathtaking. Who can ever forget the beautiful opening sequence where the camera pans over the mountains before zooming in on star Julie Andrews singing the title song. And there's that unforgettable Rodgers and Hammerstein score. The story line is simple. A novice nun Maria, (Andrews at the peak of her career) is sent to be governess for a family of seven children ranging in age from 5 to 16. The family is that of Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) a former naval hero. The story takes place during the 30s just prior to WWII. The Nazi influence is felt more or less as a background to the story until the final minutes of the movie. The songs are plentiful and memorable. My favorite is the rendition of 'Climb Every Mountain' sung by the Mother Superior (Peggy Wood). But there are so many memorable songs. Plummer tries his best with 'Eidleweiss' but the best that can be said about that, is that as a singer, Plummer makes a great actor. Andrews was born to play Maria and gives a marvelous performance in the Role. Richard Haydn as Uncle Max and Eleanor Parker as the Baroness are also in the cast. The children  who also give memorable performances are played by talented youngsters too many to mention here. 'The Sound of Music' has stood the test of time as evidenced by the recent release of a sing-a-long version to theaters. It is a true classic of family entertainment.",9,4,12,6 February 2002
Training Day," A Day in the Life....
","Denzel Washington won a long over due Oscar for his role of Detective Alonzo Harris in 'Training Day'. Washington, as is his custom fully buries himself into the role. He becomes Harris. The plot, in a nutshell, has Officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) reporting to Harris for a day od on the job training in his undercover narcotics unit. Harris shows Hoyt the seamier side of Los Angeles and attempts to show him the ways of the streets. Director Antoine Fuqua takes us into the ghetto neighborhoods and introduces us to a way of life few outside the 'hoods' have experienced. Washington as mentioned is excellent, conveying ticking time bomb type of personality. Hawke, who was nominated for an Oscar for his role, is also outstanding as the 'play by the rules' rookie. Rappers Snoop Doggy Dogg as a wheel chair bound drug dealer and Dr. Dre as a member of Harris' team give surprisingly effective performances in their roles. Scott Glenn does a nice turn as a drug dealing friend of Harris. And totally wasted as a member of 'The Three Wise Men' is Tom Berenger, who has but one brief scene. 'Training Day' has a fair amount of violence and street language, but you will just sit in awe of Washington and Hawke's performances.",8,0,11,10 April 2002
Meet the Parents," Disappointing comedy.....
","I guess I'm in the minority when I say that I found 'Meet the Parents' to be very disappointing. In spite of all the hype and advertising, I just didn't think the film was funny. I mean when the running joke of the movie is the hero's surname (Focker) you know the producers are going to be hard up for laughs. And yes, we are again exposed to yet another 'typical American family' living in an upscale neighborhood with riches and privileges only few outside the movie colony can afford.Ben Stiller as the hero does the best that he can with limited material. Robert DeNiro as the prospective father-in-law is again parodying his tough guy image, but it doesn't come off this time as well as it did in 'Analyze This' (1999). DeNiro's performance, I thought, was a bit over the top, and was for the first time a performance of his that I didn't thoroughly enjoy. The performance of Teri Polo as Stiller's love interest didn't impress me. Blythe Danner is wasted as DeNiro's scatterbrained wife. Owen Wilson's character is a bit of a mystery. How are we to believe that a hugely successful businessman such as he seems to be, can't even get a date for dinner 'at the Club'. My god, even ex-beauty queen Phyllis George is in the cast, but if you blink you'll miss her.I was not impressed with the be-belittling of the nursing profession or the continuous insults heaped upon the Stiller character. If fact, I was rooting for him to turn around and walk out right from the beginning. Both Stiller and DeNiro have done and will do better. Extremely disappointing.",4,4,6,10 May 2001
Alien: Resurrection," Slime Gentlemen Please!
","'Alien Resurrection' is the fourth and final (to date) installment of the alien series starring Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. This episode was directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet. The story takes place 200 years after 'Alien 3'. A military ship commanded by renegade General Perez (Dan Hedaya) has replaced 'The Company' in trying to capture and 'tame' the alien creatures. two doctors (J.E. Freeman, Brad Dourif) have managed to clone Ripley from a DNA sample complete with an alien creature in her body. After they remove the creature the cloned Ripley begins to exhibit unusual powers. A pirate freighter arrives on board with a cargo to be used in the cloning experiments. The freighter is led by Elgyn (Michael Wincott) and includes among others, Call (Winona Ryder) who has her own reasons for being there and macho tough guys Johner (Ron Perlman) and Christie (Gary Dourdin). One of the crew is an advanced android, but who? By now the alien creature has matured and multiplied and wouldn't you know it, escapes captivity and begins to wreak havoc. The creatures rack up a pretty gruesome body count before the film's climax. There's lots of blood and gore and slime (perhaps too much) and brutal murders to go around. The film's climax is a little hard to believe but hey, this IS science fiction. Not the best of the series but a treat for those who enjoy blood and gore.",6,1,1,13 September 2003
The Irishman," Whatever Happened to.......Jimmy Hoffa? Hmmmmmmm!
","'The Irishman' is yet another masterful film from Director Martin Scorcese. He has assembled a very large cast to fill out the film's 209 minute running time.It's the story of mob hit man and senior union official Frank 'The Irishman' Sheeran (Robert DeNiro) as he reflects on his past life. He came to be associated early with mobster Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci) whom he met at a service station when he stopped to help Frank fix his truck.. Frank begins to skim off beef sides from his employer, selling them to Skinny Razor (Bobby Cannavale) and friends. Frank becomes a close confidant of Bufalino performing several 'tasks' on his behalf.Bufalino points Frank toward Union boss Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino) with whom he becomes an entrusted friend. Frank goes back and forth between the two powerful men 'helping out' wherever he can. When Senator Robert Kennedy (Jack Houston) persecutes him, Hoffa is sent to prison for four years losing his position as Union Boss to his former assistant Frank 'Fitz' Fitzsimmons (Gary Basaraba). While in prison Hoffa is confronted by mobster and ex Union official Tony Provenzao (Stephen Graham) over Tony's lost pension benefits. The two men argue and end up in a fist fight.When Hoffa is released from prison around the time of John Kennedy's assassination, He tries to regain control of the Union. Bufalino and senior mobster Angelo Bruno (Harvey Keitel) warn him to back off as 'Fitz' has found favor with the mob. Finally, Bufalino tells Frank that the time to eliminate the troublesome Hoffa has come. Frank with mixed emotions, agrees to do this 'little service' for his mentor.Following Hoffa's disappearance, Frank's daughter Peggy (Anna Paquin) disowns him over her suspicions on the Hoffa affair. Frank and Bufalino eventually land in jail together and grow old over the years. After Bufalino's death Frank is left to dwell in the past all alone in his last years.The performances by the principals are mesmerizing. Pacino is outstanding as Jimmy Hoffa particularly in his hell raising speeches to his membership. DeNiro is sympathetic as the long suffering but faithful soldier Frank Sheeran. Joe Pesci, who had to be talked out of retirement for his role is good as the highly respected crime figure. And look for TV star Ray Romano as Bufalino lawyer Bill Bufalino.Much has been said about the terrific de-aging (and aging) process used where the main characters look and act younger (and older) without the aid of make-up. It's quite amazing indeed. As they say, this couls be the start of something big.A terrific, if overlong film.",9,7,15,2 December 2019
The Natural," For It's One, Two, Three Strikes You're Out!
","'The Natural' is one of the better baseball movies chronicling the life and times of base baller Roy Hobbs (Robert Redford).It starts out with Young Roy (Paul Sullivan Jr.), a promising pitcher, playing catch with his dad Ed (Alan Fudge) and picking up useful pointers about pitching from the old man. Unfortunately, Ed dies leaving Roy to his own devices. The adult Roy (Redford) is involved with local girl Iris Gaines (Glenn Close) and the two plan to eventually marry. We next meet Roy on his way to a tryout in Chicago with the Cubs leaving Iris behind. On the train he meets up with reporter Max Mercy (Robert Duvall) whom he will encounter later, and 'The Slammer' (Jo Don Baker) a thinly disguised Babe Ruth.Also on board is the mysterious Harriet Bird (Barbara Hershey) a gold digging femme fatale who attaches herself to 'The Slammer'. A bet is placed that Roy van strike out 'The Slammer' on three pitches. Roy accomplishes the feat and Harriet switches 'allegiance' to Roy. Roy gets involved with her but for some unexplained reason, she shoots Roy in his pitching arm and then jumps out the hotel room window to her death.Fast forward 16 years to 1939 where Roy show up unexpectedly in the New York Knights, a bottom dwelling baseball team, as a 35 year old rookie. Manager Pop Fisher (Wiford Brimley) is skeptical but coach Red Blow (Richard Farnsworth) sees something in Roy. After being benched for several games, Pop is forced to insert Roy into the lineup when regular fielder Bump Bailey (Michael Madson) tragically dies in an accident. Well, Roy promptly shows his talent for the long ball and becomes famous.One day at a game Roy spies Iris, dressed in white in the stands and something comes over him. He regains his stroke and fame. On meeting with her the old flame re-kindles. But Iris has a secret that she has kept from Roy all theses years...a son.As the Knights move toward Pop's long awaited dream of winning a pennant, Roy has a sudden attack brought on by the still lodged bullet from Harriet Bird's gun. He is told that he can never play baseball again. As the league championship game approaches, Roy announces that he will suit up one last time and..............................................................................A great supporting cast elevates this movie to classic status. Redford, even though he was in his late 40s at the time, gives a convincing performance as the 'old rookie'. He gets to romance three of the most glamorous stars of the day, Close, Hershey and Basinger. Brimley as the crusty old manager and Farsworth as the veteran coach almost steal the movie. Prosky and an unbilled McGavin are suitably slimy as the villains of the piece.And by the way, did the Knights eventually win the World Series?Roy runs into Mercy who is unable to place Roy in his memory. Kinight's owner, The Judge (Robert Prosky) and gambler Gus Sands (Darren McGavin) are betting against the team and cleaning up. In order to keep 'an eye on' Roy they arrange for gorgeous blond Memo Paris (Kim Basinger) to become 'involved' with Roy. This leads to Roy losing his focus on baseball and sees his popularity plummet in the process.",8,0,1,22 December 2019
The Others," Marvelous Scare the Pants Off of You Ghost Story!
","'The Others' is a superior ghost story in the old fashioned vein without any glitzy special effects, no blood and guts, no graphic sex and no gruesome murders. What it is, is an atmospheric, eerie and claustrophobic scare the pants off of you haunted house ghost story. The story involves a young mother Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) and her two light-sensitive children Anne and Nicholas (Alakina Mann, James Bentley) who live in an isolated manor in the middle of the countryside in 1945. The father has gone off to war and has not returned. Along come three mysterious house servants, Bertha Milk (Fionna Flanagan), Edmund Tuttle (Eric Sykes) and the mute Lydia (Elaine Cassidy), who show up unexplainably to apply for the vacant servant positions. Elaine and the children then begin to hear voices and things that go bump in the night. Are there ghosts or intruders in the house? Are the servants who they say they are? Can Grace protect her family against the evil forces? Director Alejandro Amenabar keeps us guessing throughout. He presents us with a creaky old mansion with all of the haunted house cliches (slamming doors, unexplained noises, creaking floors etc.) but does so in a style reminiscent of the classic ghost stories such as 'The Uninvited' (1944), 'The Innocents' (1961) and 'The Haunting' (1963). He gives us a slam-bang ending, with a few surprises, that you won't want to miss. Nicole Kidman, after playing second fiddle to ex-hubby Tom Cruise is finally receiving the roles and recognition she deserves. Always a beautiful and talented actress, she proves in 'The Others' what a fine dramatic actress she can be and does so without any of the trappings and glamour such as she had in her previous film 'Moulin Rouge' (2001). Alakina Mann and James Bentley are excellent as the children. Veteran performers Flanagan and Sykes as well as, virtual newcomer Cassidy stand out as the servants.  Take it from me, you won't want to miss this one.",9,0,0,16 May 2002
Insomnia," Interesting Murder Mystery!
","Contains Spoiler 'Insomnia' is the story of two L.A. detectives who are 'sent' to a small town in Alaska to help solve a grisly but methodical murder of a teen aged girl.Detectives Will Denner (Al Pacino) and Farrell (Larry Holden) are under investigation by Internal Affairs, so their chief spirits them out of town to assist a small town police chief (Paul Dooley) in the above investigation. Officer Ellie Burr (Hillary Swank) is assigned to assist the detectives. Farrell in an effort to save his own skin tells Denner that he will in effect sell him out when they return home.In pursuit of the murderer in a dense fog, Denner shoots and kills Farrell. He is not sure in his own mind whether or not the shooting was accidental or not. Complicating matters is the fact that because Denner is in Alaska at a time when there is 24 hours of daylight, he is unable to get any sleep.To further complicate matters the murderer identifies himself to Denner as mystery writer Walter Finch (Robin Williams). It seems that Finch witnessed the shooting and is now threatening to blackmail Denner unless he backs off the case and lets someone else take the fall. Denner after ten days is becoming exhausted with little sleep and is unable to think clearly. Meanwhile Officer Burr is investigating the case on her own and comes up with some interesting findings.The main part of the film is the cat and mouse game going on between the Pacino and Williams characters. Pacino is great as usual and it is interesting to see the portrayal of his character's gradual exhaustion due to insomnia. Williams, in a change of pace, doesn't appear until well into the story, but is very good as the creepy self-confessed killer. Swank has little to do to show her talents but makes the best of her role.An interesting murder mystery.",7,0,0,2 November 2002
The Terminator," The Role Arnold Was Born To Play!
","'The Terminator' is arguably the role that Arnold Schwarzenegger was born to play. It is, in my humble opinion, his best film. It's the only time in his career, I believe, where he played a totally villainous character with no redeeming qualities (forget about 'The Iceman' in that Batman film).Written and directed by James Cameron, the action and suspense are non-stop from start to finish. And the best part is that Arnold has minimal dialog, which I believe adds to the sinister nature of his character.The Terminator (Arnold) is sent back to the present (i.e. 1984) from 2029 to terminate Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) who will give birth to a futuristic leader, John Connor. Also traveling back in time is Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) who is sent by Connor to stop the terminator.We learn from Reese that the terminator is a cyborg, part machine, part human who is programmed only to seek out and kill Sarah Connor. He has no feeling and cannot be reasoned with. Two other women with the same name are murdered by the terminator before Sarah realizes the Reese is trying to help her. We also learn that neither Reese nor the terminator can return to the future.The police, led by Lt. Ed Traxler (Paul Winfield) and Detective Hal Vukoviich (Lance Henriksen) try to give Sarah police protection. When the terminator tracks her down to the police station. Arnold utters his now famous line: 'Ah'll be back!' And back he is.The rest of the film has Reese and Sarah encountering and escaping from the terminator until....................................Arnold makes a terrifying villain. Its a wonder, he didn't seek out more such roles. Hamilton makes a fetching heroine. she was or was about to be marries to James Cameron around this time. Watch for Bill Paxton as the leader of the punks who confront Arnold at the beginning of the story.Followed by two sequels where Arnold reprises his role, but as a good terminator.",8,0,2,4 March 2007
We Were Soldiers," 'They Finally Got it Right!'
","'We Were Soldiers' is based on a real life battle of the Viet Nam war that took place in 1965 in a remote part of Viet Nam. It is based on a book by Harold G. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway who are portrayed in the film by Mel Gibson and Barry Pepper respectively. The film opens with a depiction of the 1954 slaughter of French troops by the Vietnamese army. Twenty one years later Lt. Col Moore (Gibson) and his battalion of 395 men are thrust unknowingly into the same hornet's nest consisting of some 4,000 battle hardened Viet Nam regulars who have been fighting their enemies for many years.  Director Randall Wallace tells the story from three perspectives. Firstly from the viewpoint of the Americans. Outnumbered ten to one they face impossible odds. How Col. Moore rallies his troops and gets them to pull together as a team is a central theme of the picture. Secondly, the story is told from the viewpoint of the wives and families left behind and the problems they have to deal with. Lastly, the Vietnamese army is shown not as unfeeling monsters, but as a professional army defending their beliefs and territory. The battle scenes are as realistic and convincing as any war movie that you will ever see. We suffer through the casualties both on the battlefield and at home along with the participants. The special effects are seamless and exciting. Mel Gibson gives a convincing performance as Moore and if you watch the DVD, you can see the amazing similarities between the two men. Madeleine Stowe plays Julie Moore and Keri Russell plays Barbara Geoghegan two of the wives who take on the unenviable task of delivering those dreaded telegrams to the widows from the War Department. Chris Klein plays Russell's husband Jack a new officer and father. His scene with Gibson in the base chapel is memorable. Greg Kinnear plays Captain Crandall the head of Moore's helicopter fleet. Don Duong is very effective as the Vietnamese commander. But acting cudos go to veteran Sam Elliot as the crusty Sgt. Major Plumley. 'We Were Soldiers' is a gripping Viet Nam war drama told in a way that reflects ALL of the participants in an impartially realistic way. As Hank Moore says on the DVD, They finally got it right.",9,40,51,22 August 2002
Alien," In Space..No One Can Hear You Scream!
","'Alien' was the first (and best) of the four films released to date starring Sigourney Weaver as Ripley the hard assed alien fighter. Briefly the story centers on a space freighter of the future on its way back to earth towing its cargo of rare minerals and staffed by a crew of seven. When we meet them, they are just awakening from a deep sleep and think that they are nearing earth. However, the on board computer (called 'Mother') has awakened them for a different reason. An apparent distress signal is coming from an unknown source on an unknown planet. When they investigate they discover a bed of egg like growths in an underground cave. One of the 'eggs' hatches and a creature attaches itself to the face of crewman Kane (John Hurt). After a short time Kane appears to recover but then a creature suddenly emerges from his chest. The creature grows into a monster and begins to stalk the crew until..... Director Ridley Scott gives us what amounts to a haunted house in outer space horror story. We just barely get a glimpse of the creature as it attacks. The crew moves about long, dark and damp cavernous passageways from where the creature could emerge at any moment. Scott creates an atmosphere of claustrophobia as the crew is trapped where in space..no one can hear you scream. He also utilizes Ripley's cat, Jones to great effect. The cast is first rate. In addition to Weaver as Ripley and John Hurt as Kane, there is Tom Skerritt as Dallas the commander of the ship, Veronica Cartright as Lambert, Yahfet Kotto as Parker, Harry Dean Stanton as Brett and Ian Holm as Ash the Science officer who has secrets of his own. All turn in excellent performances as Ridley Scott keeps the suspense building. For a perceived horror picture there is surprisingly little on screen violence involving the creature, as this is largely left to the imagination of the viewer. Two scenes involving the Ash and Kane characters are the exception. An excellent well directed sci-fi horror film.",8,0,1,11 September 2003
Taxi Driver," Bickle in a Pickle!
","'Taxi Driver' is a story about an ex-Marine, Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro)presumably a Viet Nam vet with problems in that he is an insomniac. He takes a job driving a taxi at night and goes to watch porn movies by day. He sees New York City as a cesspool of evil what with the prostitutes, drug addicts, pimps, johns et al roaming the streets at night.One day Travis see a beautiful girl in a white dress and becomes obsessed with her. She turns out to be a campaign worker for Presidential hopeful Senator Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris). Her name is Betsy and co-worker Tom (Albert Brooks has an obvious interest in her as well. Travis gets up the nerve to confront her at her workplace and invite her out for a cup of coffee abd a piece of pie. All goes well and Travis asks her out to a movie.Travis buys her a gift and takes her to a porn movie unaware that this will not appeal to Betsy. She becomes angry and storms out of the theater and never wants to see him again. Travis is distraught. He goes out and buys an arsenal of guns with an eventual plan to rid the streets of the smut he despises. He seeks advice from veteran fellow cabbie 'The Wizard' (Peter Boyle) who advises him to sit tight and things will right themselves.One night, a young hooker, Iris (Jodie Foster) climbs into his cab but is forcefully removed by her pimp Matthew aka 'Sport' (Harvey Keitel). Travis takes little notice of it at the time and goes about his business. Later, a passenger in his cab who wants to kill his wife's lover (Martin Scorsese) describes the damage a .44 Magnum will do to various parts of the body.Travis again encounters the 12 year old Iris and feels that she should be out of the mess she's in. He 'hires' Iris for some jollies but instead offers to help her return to her parents. Sport convinces her to stay. Travis snaps and formulates a plan to free Iris from her pimp's grasp.Travis shaves his head into a 'Mohawk' and arms himself to the teeth. First he seemingly stalks Palantine but is driven off bu his guards. Next Travis goes to Sport's house of ill repute and.................................................................................Many were or are opposed to the subject matter of this film and its' graphic violence. It's well handled by Scorsese as he brings an unpleasant subject front and center. I had trouble though, with the 'happily ever after' ending following the climactic carnage. It was probably done to appease the censors as the story could have ended with the violence.Robert DeNiro was just coming into his own as a major star having won an Oscar two years previous for 'The Godfather Part II'. He practically has to carry the whole film by himself and does so masterfully. Jodie Foster, a former child actor, who really was 12 years old at the time gives us a glimpse of her immense talent.You talkin' to me, you talkin' to me.",7,0,0,19 November 2019
Interstellar," What the Hell is Going On?
","'Interstellar' is this generation's answer to Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968). As with the earlier film, 'Interstellar' requires the viewer to have his/her thinking cap on.The storyline has to do with the earth slowly dying and unable to produce the food it needs to survive due to harsh climatic changes. Under the veil of secrecy, a team of astronauts is sent off into space to go through a 'black hole' in space to seek out new worlds on which earthlings can survive and prosper. The film boasts a large cast and an extensive running time.I'm not the smartest guy in the world but I had a hard time trying to figure out what the hell was going on. Firstly, I had a hard time understanding what star Matthew McConaughy, who speaks in a low mumbly tone, was saying. Secondly I couldn't figure out what Anne Hathaway's character was doing on the mission except to look pretty. She is supposed to be the daughter of top scientist (Michael Caine) and just is not convincing to me. And it's not explained how McConaughy's character is firstly a farmer and secondly a world famous astronaut. And I'm still trying to figure out what Matt Damon's character was doing, why he was where he was and why he tries to eliminate Coopper (McConaughy). Then Cooper ends up back in an alternate universe where he's peeking through a bookcase in his daughter;s bedroom where he sees events from the past as he tries to communicate with his daughter 'Murph' played by Jessica Chastain, Mackenzie Fot and Ellen Bustyn at various stages of her life. As in '2001', I became totally confused.Anyway, I have to give the film high marks for it's technical achievements. The special effects are among the best that I have seen. Director Christopher Nolan keeps the story moving along even though he couldn't seem to get McConasughy to speak up.Michael Caine as always gives an excellent performance as the head scientists. At 80 plus he can still act circles around most of the cast. John Lithgow is totally wasted as McConaughy's father as is Anne Hathaway as the token female lead.'Interstellar' is certainly worth a look if not for for it's special effects then for it's storyline, but if you want to understand what McConayughy is saying, turn on the close captioning if watching on TV.",6,3,4,1 October 2015
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Better Than Episode I...but
","'Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones' is the second prequel to the original three Star Wars movies. Producer/Director George Lucas must have given the 'all systems are go' to his special effects arm, Industrial Light and Magic, because what we have here is wall to wall special effects and computer generate imaging. They are expertly done as always, but the real actors must have had to play all of their scenes in front of a blue screen. Many of the characters are computer generated as are virtually all of the set pieces. The story picks up as Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christenson) is now a teenager who is in love with the older (if Episode I was any indication) Senator Padema Amidala. We know that they will ultimately be the parents of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leah. Anakin is now the Jedi knight apprentice of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and is beginning to exhibit leanings toward the dark side. An army of clones is being created to battle the evil forces of what will eventually become the Empire led by Count Dooku (the ageless Christopher Lee). We are treated to many excellent battle scenes convincingly staged with computer generated armies. And there's some dandy light saber duels as well. The many space ships though, do seem to be more advanced than those appearing in the original three films even though those films are set many years later. Ewan McGregor is better this time around as a more mature and convincing Obi-Won but he still has too much of a devil may care attitude I thought, in the action scenes. Christenson to me, is much too young to be convincing as Anakin, the future Darth Vader. Portman is also too young to be believable as a trusted senior Senator. This film is raised a notch or two with the expansion of Samuel L. Jackson's role as Jedi leader Mace Windu and the casting of Christopher Lee as the chief villain. Lee who is almost 80 steals the acting honors as the Darth Vader/Count Dracula like Count Dooku. He looks and acts 25 years younger than his real age. And Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz) has more to do and even has a light saber duel. Fortuneately the annoying Jar Jar Binks (Daffy Duck in the 24th 1/2 Century) has only a small role in this one. All in all, this film is very entertaining even though Lucas & Co. did go a little overboard once again with their special effects. Better than Episode I but still not even close to the original three.",7,0,2,17 November 2002
Predator," Run Through the Jungle!
","'Predator' was one of star Arnold Schwarzeneggar's better films of the 80s. He was in top physical condition as evidenced by his bulging biceps which are on display throughout the film.Dutch (Arnold) and his elite rescue team land in a remote unnamed Latin country. In addition to himself, there is Mac (Bill Duke), Blain (Jesse Ventura), Billy (Sonny Landham), Poncho (Richard Chaves) and Hawkins (Shane Black). They are there to assist CIA Colonel Dillon (Carl Weathers) in rescuing a cabinet minister (from where we are not told), who has been kidnapped.As they plod through the dense jungle, they find a wrecked helicopter and later the crew skinned alive and left hanging from the trees. Later they come upon a rebel guerilla camp where the prisoners are being held. Dutch and his team, in typical Arnold fashion, wipe out the camp in an exciting sequence without sustaining a casualty. They take a young woman, Anna, prisoner and hold her for questioning.It is at this point that Dutch realizes that they have been duped as there is no cabinet minister and no ransom demand. It seems that in order to acquire the services of Dutch and his team, the caper had to appear to be a rescue mission. But the troubles for the group are just beginning.From the opening scene we are aware that some form of alien has been dropped off on earth for an unknown reason. The alien has the power to cloak himself so that he cannot be seen. He begins to stalk the crew. Anna tries to escape and is caught by Hawkins. They are the first to be attacked by the alien predator (Kevin Peter Hall) who appears to be hunting each member of the crew. Hawkins is brutally slain but Anna is spared. The predator with its advanced weaponry and gadgets is no match for the crew.One by one each man is brutally killed until only Dutch and Anna remain. Dutch sends her to find the waiting helicopter while he prepares for a final showdown with the predator. The final 15 or 20 minutes of the film is all Arnold and the predator. A cat and mouse game between the two ensues and............................Lots of blood and gore in this one. From the attack on the Guerilla camp to the final showdown, bodies pile up and blood spatters throughout. Not for the faint of heart 'The Predator' is nonetheless an excellent action adventure. I thought the opening scene where an alien is 'dropped off' on earth gave away the surprise of the predator hiding in the jungle. The reason for his presence is never really explained nor is the country where the action takes place, unless I missed it, is not named.Vintage Arnold.",7,1,1,4 December 2018
Cast Away," The Ultimate Survivor
","Although 'Cast Away' is effectively a 143 minute commercial for Fed Ex, it is nonetheless a good movie. In the midst of the many 'reality based' TV shows, Director Robert Zemeckis and star Tom Hanks give us a feeling of what it would really be like to have to survive in the wilderness. Hanks plays Chuck Noland a troubleshooter for Fed Ex whose plane goes down somewhere over the Pacific Ocean during a raging storm. He somehow survives and washes up on the beach of a deserted island. He is forced to learn how to survive by using the materials and resources that are available to him in this wilderness. Zemeckis and Hanks through his stunning performance, are able to convey the loneliness and isolation of an everyman in a seemingly hopeless situation. We see the Hanks character grow his hair and beard, lose weight (which he actually did for the film) and form a touching 'friendship' with a volleyball onto which he has drawn a face and calls 'Wilson', to keep from going mad. He also longs for the girl he left behind (Helen Hunt) by constantly looking at a picture of her in the watch that she had given him. Hanks is outstanding in the lead role and Hunt does what she can in a limited role. Watch for Chris Noth in small part. I thought the producers went a little too far though in their Fed-Ex tie-in. I mean, we see Fed-Ex trucks and packages all through the picture and yes, even on the desert island. Oh my god, I think they got me too. How many times have I mentioned 'Fed-Ex' in MY comments?",8,2,4,26 September 2001
North by Northwest," Superb Hitchcock Thriller!
","'North By Northwest' is another of Alfred Hitchcock's thrillers where an ordinary man is put into an extraordinary situation. As in most of these movies, the hero has to quickly adapt to his situation or perish. This time it is Cary Grant who is thrust into a world of international intrigue when is mistaken by villain James Mason for an American operative named George Kaplan (the film's 'McGuffan' by the way). Along the way he is seduced by Mason's mistress (Eva Marie Saint) while being pursued by Mason and his cronies from New York to Chicago to South Dakota and ultimately to Mount Rushmore for the film's climax. 'North By Northwest' is full of classic Hitchcock moments. First,there is Grant's frustration and fear as he tries to explain to Mason that he is not the person they are seeking. Next, the scene in the cornfield where Grant is isolated and attacked by a plane is pure Hitchcock. Then we have the art auction where he cleverly escapes Mason's henchmen and finally, the finale at Mount Rushmore in a scene reminiscent of a similar one in 'Sabotage' (1942) (which took place at the top of the Statue of Liberty). The cast, as in most Hitchcock films is excellent. Grant is understandably confused and frightened as the the hero, Eva Marie Saint has never been sexier as the femme fatale, James Mason is suave and sinister as the villain and Martin Landau in an early role, is good as Mason's chief henchman. Hitchcock regular Leo G. Carroll is cold heartedly sinister as the 'professor'. Jesse Royce Landis as Grant's mother (she was about Grant's real age) is wasted and unnecessary to the plot. The only problem that I have with this and other Hitchcock films is his over reliance on back projection and soundstage 'exteriors'. Other than that. 'North By Northwest' has to be considered as one of Hitchcock's best. Watch for Hitchcock's hilarious cameo appearance at the end of the opening credits.",9,4,5,20 October 2001
Judgment at Nuremberg," A True Cinematic Masterpiece
","'Judgment at Nuremberg' is one of the great films of all time. This can be attributed to the excellent script written by Abby Mann, its skillful direction by Stanley Kramer and possibly one of the greatest casts ever assembled for a motion picture.The subject trial takes place in 1948 long after the trials of the major German military generals when most people had lost interest in such proceedings. Writer Mann chose to write about the trial of German judges, the people who above all, should have seen the evil of Hitler and his followers coming.Assigned to the trial as Chief Judge is Dan Haywood (Spencer Tracy) a low profile justice who by his own admission was not the original or subsequent choice. The prosecutor is Col. Tad Lansing (Richard Widmark) an 'army man' who vows to convict the four ex-German Judges. Defending the accused is Hans Rolfe (Maximillian Schell) who must convince the court that the defendants were acting only for the love of their country.Among the defendants are respected Judge Ernst Janning (Burt Lancaster) who has written several books on law accepted the world over. Lawson accuses the defendants of signing orders for the sterilization of innocent men and the execution of those who opposed to the Reich and the extermination of the jews. He puts Rudolph Peterson (Montgomery Clift) on the stand as a victim of sterilization. Rolfe manages to expose the pitiful Peterson as mentally challenged. Later Irene Hoffman (Judy Garland) is put on the stand to explain her alleged affair at the age of 16 with an elderly jew. As his coup de grace, Lawson shows a film depicting the horrors of German concentration camps.In between the sessions, Judge Haywood strikes up a friendship with Madame Bertholt (Marlene Dietrich) the widow of a former German general, in whose former home the judge is staying. In spite of their differences they begin to grow fond of each other.The army pressures Lawson to ease up and suggests that acquittal or light sentences would best serve American interests since this was the time that the blockade of Berlin was beginning. Judge Haywood is also pressured to go easy on the sentencing.Maximillian Schell deservedly won an Oscar for his outstanding performance as Rolfe. Any one of the other principals could have easily won as well. Clift and Garland are simply outstanding as are Widmark and Lancaster. And Tracy, did he ever give a bad performance? The still beautiful Dietrich was also excellent. Others in the cast are a very young William Shatner as Capt. Byers, a court officer, Werner Kemperer as Emil Hahn the most militant of the defendants and Ray Teal as Judge Ives. Teal had long been a fixture in westerns and is probably best remembered for playing Sheriff Coffey on TV's Bonanza.The DVD release contains an excellent conversation between Abby Mann and Maximillian Schell plus an interview with Kramer's widow, the still beautiful former actress Karen Sharpe.A true cinematic masterpiece.",10,50,72,25 September 2004
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Good Terminator.....Bad Terminator!
","'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' was James Cameron's highly successful, special effects laden sequel to his earlier hit 'The Terminator' (1984) which had catapulted star Arnold Schwarzeneggar to super stardom. In that film Arnold was a pure villain. Here he is again the hero.T2 takes place about ten years after the first film. We find that John Connor (Edward Furlong) is now a smart ass teenager living with and defying his foster parents the Voights (Jennette Goldstein, Xander Berkley). Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is now in a mental institution where no one believes her predictions of total Armageddon.From the year 2029, John Connor, the leader of the anti-machine rebels, dispatches a terminator (Arnold) back in time to protect himself from harm. The machine race also sends a terminator, the new and improved T-1000 model (Robert Patrick) who has the ability morph into any life form he chooses and is virtually indestructible. He is made from 'liquid metal' which allows him to re-form any time after he is blown away by Arnold or any one else.Sarah is unsuccessful at convincing Dr. Silverman (Earl Boen) that she is sane, so she plans an escape. Meanwhile Arnold has materialized and throws a couple of bikers through pool room windows while acquiring his wardrobe, weapons and a motorcycle. The T-1000 also appears and takes on the guise of a cop. Both try to track down the whereabouts of John Connor.Arnold finds him first and whisks him away from danger on his bike. Their escape from the T-1000 in a semi cab is one of the highlights of the film. Arnold and John go to the asylum and help free Sarah while the T-1000 murders the Voights while trying to trap John. John learns that the terminator is programmed to obey him and instructs the robot not to kill anyone. Bummer.Sarah is no longer the fearful innocent of the first film, but a hard-nosed freedom fighter complete with an unexplained cache of weapons with which to arm Arnold. Anyway, they soon learn that Miles Dyson (Joe Morton) will be the one responsible for developing the technology that will ultimately cause the final war in which the machines inherit the earth.Sarah sneaks off to Dyson's home intent upon killing him. She shoots up his equipment, terrifying Dyson, his wife (S. Epatha Merkerson) and their young son. But Sarah in the final analysis, is unable to kill him. Arnold and John arrive on the scene and learn that the basis for Dyson's discoveries is a damaged memory chip from the first terminator. Now convinced that Sarah is right, Dyson agrees to go to his laboratory and destroy all evidence of his work.The T-1000 is relentless in his pursuit and nothing is able to stop him, bullets, fires or explosions. Finally he corners Arnold and the Connors in a smelting plant and...................................Producer/Director Cameron gives us an exciting action packed story. It doesn't however, have the originality and believability of the first film. Arnold starts out as the same emotionless robot of the first film but Cameron allows him to develop a 'personality' and become more sympathetic. He was much more effective, as the unfeeling villain in the first picture.Although many of the special effects are indeed spectacular, they are just not believable. The scores of wrecked vehicles and persons thrown about and/or blown up/shot stretches credibility to the maximum. But hey, this is an Arnold film and one expects such things. And Cameron's use of the melting metal effect is over done. There appears to be no working parts in the T-1000 other than this metal. Arnold on the other hand, is a walking computer with explainable parts.Followed by a second sequel, Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines (2003) which, to date, is Schwarzeneggar's final film.",7,1,1,3 July 2007
Apocalypse Now," One of the Best Viet Nam War Films!
","'Apocalypse Now' either in its original version (1979) or the expanded Redux version (2001) is one of the best ever films dealing with the Viet Nam war. The story deals with the trials and tribulations of army Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) who is sent on a secret mission to assassinate a highly decorated army colonel (Marlon Brando) who has reached his breaking point and is causing embarrassment to the U.S. government. To reach his quarry, Willard must sail up a river in a small boat into the forbidden country of Cambodia. The helicopter raid on a small village is a highlight of the journey. Director Francis Ford Coppula gives us a visually stunning film filled with unforgettable characters. In addition to Sheen (in his best role to date) and Brando, there is a great performance by Robert Duvall as Colonel Kilgore who 'loves the smell of napalm in the morning', Albert Hall, Sam Bottoms, Frederic Forrest and a teen-aged Laurence Fishburne as the boat crew, Dennis Hopper as a spaced out photo journalist, G. D. Spradlin and a young Harrison Ford as the men who send Willard on his quest and in the Redux version, distinguished French actor Christian Marquand as the owner of the French Plantation. If you blink you'll miss Scott Glenn as Sheen's predecessor. Speaking of the Redux version, although it adds a couple of extra stops on Willard's journey, it really doesn't improve on an already great film. It adds scenes involving the Playboy playmates, a visit to the French Plantation and an extra scene for Brando. But it doesn't expand on the ending which I still find confusing. For example, how does Willard just walk away from Brando's camp with his supporters (who have performed brutal acts already) staring on with glassy-eyed disinterest, particularly in view of the grisly events that have just taken place. Still in either version, 'Apocalypse Now' is a truly great film.",9,0,0,9 January 2002
Spider-Man," This Looks Kind of Familiar
","'Spider-Man' is a very entertaining and well produced movie. The special effects are very realistic and seamless with the live action. But as I watched it, I had the feeling of deja vu. The story is simple. Nerdy teenager Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is bitten by a genetically altered spider and begins to take on the characteristics of the insect. He then begins to battle the forces of evil in the city and faces off against another genetically altered being called The Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). The similarities between this film and the first two Superman movies is more than coincidental. For example, Parker is orphaned and cared for by an aunt (Rosemary Harris) and uncle (Cliff Robertson) who dies tragically as was the case with Clark Kent. Spider-Man battles the super human Green Goblin. Superman battled three super villains. Spider-man's rescue of the heroine Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst)from the top of a collapsing building is almost identical to Superman's rescue of Lois Lane in the first Superman movie. J.K. Simmons plays a Perry white like character called J. Jonah Jameson and so on. The boyish looking Maguire is surprisingly good in the lead role and Dunst is suitably fresh and innocent as the girl who loves Spider-Man but the one that Peter Parker can't have (shades of Lois Lane?)and veterans Robertson and Harris are good as the aunt and uncle. Dafoe on the other hand, is way over the top as the villain but then how else could he have played him. Simmons equally hams it up as the newspaper editor. Even though 'Spider-Man borrows heavily from Superman it is nonetheless a very exciting and entertaining two hours thanks mainly to Tobey Maguire.",7,0,0,8 November 2002
Cross of Iron," Gritty Realistic WWII Drama
","'Cross of Iron' was Sam Peckinpah's only war movie. It deals with a  company of German soldiers retreating through Russia at the close of  Hitler's ill-fated Russian campaign. Unusual for a war film,  the story is told from the German point of view.  Being a Peckinpah film there are explosions and blood-spurting bodies  a-plenty. The rough terrain and cramped quarters that the soldiers have  to deal with lend well to the declining German fortunes in Russia. As  in his other films, notably 'The Wild Bunch', Peckinpah utilizes his  now famous slow-motion technique to illustrate the violence and show  the effects of the destruction.  James Coburn stars as the battle wise Sgt. Steiner who has survived the  war thus far by his wits. Maximillian Schell plays his aristocratic  Captain whose main goal is the pursuit of the Iron Cross, Germany's  highest decoration and who will go to any lengths to get it. James  Mason is the Company commander and David Warner is his adjutant.  Coburn is excellent in the lead who continues to do his duty in spite  of the inevitability of impending defeat. Schell is suitably ambitious  and cunning as the chief villain and Mason and Warner convey the  hopelessness of the situation while maintaining stiff upper lips.  'Cross of Iron', in it's uncut version (132 minutes) ranks as one of  the greatest of all WWII films in my opinion. One of Peckinpah's best.",8,62,74,23 October 2001
Aliens," This Time It's a War!
","'Aliens' is the second of four alien films starring Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. James Cameron takes over from Ridley Scott as the director for this installment. The story picks up where the original left off when Ripley's shuttle craft is found by a salvage ship. When she comes around she discovers that it is now 57 years later and of course no one believes her story. She also finds out from 'Company' man Burke (Paul Reiser) that the planet upon which the first alien was discovered, is now inhabited. Then it is discovered that all communications has ceased from that planet. So Burke convinces Ripley to accompany him and a platoon of crack marines, as a consultant to go back to the planet to see what has happened. The marines are led by a green lieutenant (William Hope) and include a tough sergeant (Al Mathews), Cpl. Hicks (Michael Biehn), a tough female, Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein) and a nervous Pvt. Hudson (Bill Paxton). An android called Bishop (Lance Hendricksen) is also along.  They arrive at the station on the planet and find the it is deserted...except for a frightened little girl called 'Newt' (Carrie Henn). Ripley manages to gain the girl's confidence and becomes her protector. She also discovers that Burke has his own agenda. The marines find the alien nest while on a reconnaissance mission. The aliens attack and several marines are killed. The survivors retreat back into the station and prepare for the ultimate invasion. James Cameron wisely decided not to duplicate the first film which was essentially a claustrophobic horror film. This film has more gadgets, more action and more bodies. The special effects are quite convincing and the battles with the monsters are very exciting.  The character of Ripley if you can believe it goes from a frightened civilian to a female Arnold Schwarzeneggar virtually overnight and acquires an instant expertise in the weaponry as well. While that's a little hard to believe, the action sequences are quite well done especially the final battles. Not quite up to the level of the first film but an exciting action film nonetheless.",7,0,2,11 September 2003
The Exorcist," You're the Devil in Disguise...Oh Yes You Are!
","Back in 1973 people lined up around the block to see the story of a young girl possessed by the devil. More or less tame by today's graphic violence, it was at the time, innovative.The first part of the movie introduces us to the main characters. Father Merrin (Max von Sydow) is in Iran at an excavation looking for ancient ruins. He discovers an old demonic relic and then a statue of satan which to him is a premonition of evil. Back in the USA we meet rich and famous actress Chris MacNeil filming a movie in Washington. She lives in a luxurious home with her 12 year old daughter Regan (Linda Blair), her secretary/assistant Sharon (Kitty Winn) and two servants Karl Rudolf Schundler) and Willi (Gina Petrushka). The third main character Father Karras (Jason Miller) is caring for his aged mother and is questioning his faith.Chris starts hearing things that go bump in the night and notices changes in her daughter's behavior. She takes her to all the best doctors who tell her that it is temporary mental condition that is to be treated with the drug Ritalin. Meanwhile, Father Karras' mother dies and he feels guilt over not being there for her when she passed.At a party in Chris' home, her drunken director Burke Dennings goes after Karl a German, causing a clash between the two men. Regan enters and announces that Dennings is going to die. Later Denning's contorted body is found at the foot of a staircase beneath Regan's bedroom window, Detective William Kindeman (Lee J. Cobb) comes to the home to investigate. He talks to Father Karras and asks his advice.Regan's condition worsens as she begins to take on an evil persona cursing and lashing out at those who try to help her. Her bed vibrates uncontrolably and she takes on a demonic appearance speaking in a satanic voice. Chris goes to Father Karras who is also a psychiatrist for help. He gets vomit in the face for his trouble. Chris suggests an exorcism which Karras cannot attempt to perform without church sanction.As matters get worse, Fr. Karras goes to his bishop for advice. He suggests bringing Father Merrin an aging priest who had performed an exorcism years earlier. The two priest goes to the MacNeil home to attempt an exorcism. Regan plays on Fr. Karras' nerves as she taunts him over the death of his mother. Fr. Merrin cautions him to ignore the taunts. Then all hell breaks loose and....................................................................Linda Blair is outstanding as the possessed child although Mercedes McCambridge provided the demonic voice for her. The whole cast in fact is superior. Burstyn as the frantic mother is excellent as is Miller as the guilt ridden Fr. Karras. Max von Sydow playing a character much older than his actual age also stands out even though he is absent for most of the central part of the film.A classic horror film.",8,0,0,26 October 2019
Gandhi," A Deeply Moving Film!
","'Gandhi' is the story of Indian legend Mohatma Gandhi (Ben Kingsley) and his non-violent crusades for the rights of Indians in South Africa and his fight to gain independence for India from English colonial rule. It covers the period in Gandhi's life from 1893 to 1948.The 190 minute film is divided into two parts. Part I deals mostly with Gandhi's time as a lawyer in South Africa. It starts with his being literally thrown off of a train for doing the unspeakable thing of travelling in a first class compartment. He immediately takes up the cause fighting for equal rights for Indians which he achieves over the ensuing twenty years.Becoming somewhat of a legend back home, he is asked to take up the cause of obtaining India's independence from England. This fight takes up Part two of the film. He meets firm opposition from the British to the point that he winds up being thrown into prison many times. He goes on lengthy fasts to bring home his point of non-violence. Unfortunately, some violent happenings occur. The Amritsar massacre of 1919 results in several hundred Indian protestors being slaughtered. Another event occurs when police brutality results in a revolt against authority.Violence among the Hindus and Muslims follows and seems unending until Gandhi mounts a long fast to the point of near death. Finally, he achieves his goal and sections of land are ceded to the Muslims in what now is known as Pakistan. India is granted it's independence from England in 1947 and becomes a full member of the British Commonwealth of Nations. Unfortunately, dissidents assassinate the elder statesman on January 30, 1948.Director Richard Attenborough gives us a grand scale of the life of this great man. He populates his cast with several veteran and new performers. Ben Kingsley, who was largely unknown internationally, gives a mesmerizing performance as Gandhi. He was so convincing in the role that several native Indians saw him as a second coming. Rohini Hattangadi as Ghandhi's wife is equally outstanding.Also in in the cast in roles of varying sizes are: Candice Bergen as Life reporter Margaret Bourke-White, Edward Fox as General Dyer the perpetrator of the Amritsar Massacre, John Geilgud, John Mills, Trevor Howard, Ian Bannen, Michael Hordern and Nigel Hawthorne as various authoritive figures, Ian Charleson as Charlie Andrews Ghandi's cleric co-patriot, Martin Sheen as a New York reporter and Geraldine James as Mirabehn an admiral's daughter who joins Ghandhi's crusade and becomes his adopted daughter.Also watch for Daniel Day-Lewis as Colin the youth who confrons Kingsley and Charleson in South Africa and John Ratzenberger as Bergen's driver.A magnificent film.",9,0,0,13 December 2019
Pearl Harbor," Frighteningly Realistic Depiction of the Attack on Pearl Harbor
","'Pearl Harbor' re-creates the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. The battle scenes using convincing miniatures, blended in with the latest in state of the art computer animation, give us a frighteningly realistic depiction of the that attack. The effects are so convincing that you believe that you are watching the real thing. But Hollywood makes the same mistake it made with that other epic, 'Titanic' (1997)..it tacks on yet another syrupy love story. This time there is a love triangle involving Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett as gung ho pilots and Kate Beckinsale as a nurse. As in all love triangles with a war theme, you know that one of the principals will pay the ultimate sacrifice.
 The love story dominates the first hour of the film and drags on far too long. Once the attack begins we are treated to some of the most realistic battle scenes ever put on the screen. We are also made to feel the pain of the men and women who sacrificed their lives that day. The leads are OK however, the film would not have suffered too much had the love story been minimized. There also is a long list of familiar faces in small cameo type roles. Cuba Gooding Jr. stands out as the first black man to win the Navy Cross, Jon Voight does a good FDR, Mako is the Japanese Commander, Alec Baldwin plays the a pilot commander and Dan Aykroyd and Scott Miller turn up in other roles. All in all 'Pearl Harbor' gets a passing mark based on its awesome battle scenes, but looses points for the over-long love story. Imagine the film that could have been had they filmed the attack around a story such as 'From Here to Eternity' (1953).",7,0,2,8 December 2001
Zulu," Who Are Those Guys???
","'Zulu' is a superior action film much like the American Indians vs. the Cavalry films covering the same period. It takes place in 1879 South Africa mostly on an isolated post called Rork's Drift.The opening narration (spoken by Richard Burton) tells of the massacre of 1200 British Troops by Zulu warriors. Cut to a Zulu wedding ceremony where Swedish missionary Otto Witt (Jack Hawkins) and his daughter Margareta (Ulla Jacobson) are enjoying the proceedings. Suddenly a warrior arrives with news of the massacre of the British garrison. The Witts flee to their home base at the British post of Rork's Drift with news of an impending Zulu attack.The post of about 100 men is under the command of snobbish Lieutenant Bromhead (Michael Caine). A Royal Engineer Lt. John Chard (Stanley Baker) is on sight building a bridge. When news of the coming attack by some 4,000 Zulu warriors is known, preparations have to be made to defend the post. Competition arises between the two officers with Chard imposing his seniority over Bromhead and assuming command.Much of the first hour of the film deals with the post's preparations for the attack. The post is kept in suspense awaiting the attack. When the attack comes it is vicious and brutal. The British with their superior battle tactics survive the onslaught with few casualties. Now exhausted and spent they await the final attack when..................................................................................This film is a true story and several members of the force were awarded the Victoria Cross , Britain's highest honour for their bravery. The battle scenes directed by Cy Endfield, are realistically depicted in spite of rubber bayonets and spears.Baker and Caine (in his first major role) are excellent as the beleaguered officers facing their first battle and trying to mount a viable defence against a much superior force. Jack Hawkins as the fanatical preacher has little to do before he and his daughter are sent away prior to the battle. We never do find out their fates. Others in the excellent cast include Nigel Green as Colour Sgt. Bourne, James Booth as Hook the rebellious prisoner in sick bay, and Patrick Magee as the surgeon among others.We are never told the reasons behind the Zulu attacks or why the British are camped in an isolated post in the first place. I assume it all had to do with the British colonization of South Africa and the Zulu not wanting to be colonized.A good movie.",8,1,2,3 April 2019
Driven," A Real Disappointment!
","'Driven' is a movie about life on the Indy Car racing circuit. While the shots of the various racing venues are interesting and colorful, the special effects involving the obligatory car crashes are amateurish and give the film the look of a video game. Sylvester Stallone (who wrote the screenplay) stars as Joe Tanto a washed up former driver who is called back by race team owner Burt Reynolds to coach the current boy wonder Jimmy Bly (Kip Pardue) to the world championship. Bly is competing against, now get this, Beau Brandenburg (a 'B' movie name if ever there was one) played by Til Schweiger on the track and for the affections of Sophia (Estella Warren). Stallone's character is not that of the gung ho hero we are used to, but that of a wimp who is ordered about by Reynolds. Reynolds, by the way takes the acting honors in the picture as Carl Henry the team boss. Others in the cast are Gina Gershon (very good as Stallone's ex), Robert Sean Leonard as Bly's scheming brother and Stacy Edwards as Stallone's love interest. Stallone and Reynolds play what amount to supporting roles. This is the biggest flaw of the movie. The central characters are the younger actors, Pardue, Schweiger and Warren and none are able to carry the picture. That together with the video game effects make this picture a real disappointment.",5,0,1,13 February 2002

The University cancels their grant for lack of results and the boys are suddenly out of work. Peter suggests that they go into business for themselves.Ray mortgages his parents house (three mortgages are not uncommon these days) and they set up shop in an abandoned firehouse. They name the business 'Ghostbusters' with the aim of ridding New Yorkers of scary ghosts. They 'invent' complex scientific equipment that includes zappers and ghost traps, hire the spunky Janine Melnitz (Annie Potts) as their receptionist/secretary and await their first customer.Their first call comes from the library where the librarian has encountered a netherworld spirit. The boys arrive and meet up with a cartoonish spirit known as 'Slimer' who slime all who encounter him. They go next to a large hotel where 'Slimer' turns up on the 12th floor haunting the establishment's plush conference suite.

Rick Moranis is quite funny as the nerdy neighbor who continuously keeps locking himself out of his apartment. And poor Ernie Hudson.

Black Hawk Down," Frighteningly Realistic Tale of Brave Men
","Director Ridley Scott hits another home run with 'Black Hawk Down'. It is the story of a group of American Delta Force and Rangers sent into a hostile area of a Somalian city in October, 1993, to extract two senior officers of the dominant Somalian war lord. What seemed to be a cut and dried mission at first, goes horribly wrong when two of the Black Hawk helicopters are shot down. The mission then becomes one of survival from the hordes of angry and armed Somalis that attack them. 'Let no man be left behind' is the basis on which the Americans operate. I had the opportunity to see an A&E documentary called 'Black Hawk Down: The True Story' before watching this film. The documentary used actual footage from the real attack and interviewed many of the surviving participants of the ill-fated raid. The film was amazingly true to the actual events and was true to the heroic actions of the vastly out numbered American force. The special effects in the film are so realistic that you would swear that you were seeing the actual conflict. Scott also added to the realism by using an ensemble cast with no one actor being the star. It gave the feel of actual units of buddies looking out for each other at their own peril. Josh Hartnett, Eric Buna, Ewan McGregor, William Fichtner and Tom Sizemore are among the soldiers under siege and Sam Shepard is the embattled American Commanding General. All performances give the feel of real soldiers in a real battle. 'Black Hawk Down' will surely go down as one of the most frighteningly realistic war movies ever made.

Singin' in the Rain," Gene Kelly's Crowning Moment!
","'Singin' in the Rain' is considered by many to be the greatest movie musical of all time. It's hard to argue that point. It's got everything, a solid cast, great songs, glorious Technicolor and solid production numbers.Don Lockwood (Kelly and Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) are vaudevillians in the 1920s.

Kathy is trained to dub Lamont's voice in the studio's first sound film. It is a big success. Lamont arranges for Kathy to be contractually bound to continue dubbing her voice. But Lockwood, Cosmo, and studio boss R.F. Simpson (Millard Mitchell have other ideas and...................................There are several memorable performances in this film. O'Connor performs the comical 'Make 'em Laugh', Kelly of course performs the title tune and appears in the 'Broadway Melody' production number with a cast of thousands and the lovely Cyd Charisse with whom he has a couple of dance numbers. The stars do a delightful 'Good Mornin' song and dance as well. Jean Hagen almost steals the film as the deceitful Lina Lamont.MGM dusted off several of their old songs for this film. 'Good Mornin'' for example, was sung by Judy Garland in 1939's 'Babes in Arms'. The song, 'Beautiful Girl' is ably performed by Jimmy Thompson who received no billing or acclaim for his effort. Wwatch for Rita Moreno as Zelda, Lamont's scheming ally. 'B' western bad guy Douglas Fowley turns in a dandy performance as the frustrated director and Kathleen Freeman and King Donovan turn up in minor roles as well.This would by Gene Kelly's second of back to back successes following 'An American in Paris' a year earlier. Sadly the movie musical was on decline and both Kelly and O'Connor would soon be searching for alternatives. The diminutive Debbie Reynolds was just getting started and would go on performing on stage, film and TV for the rest of her life.",9,3,3,3 December 2017
Where Eagles Dare," Exciting Though Improbable WWII Adventure
","'Where Eagles Dare' is a very exciting and expensively mounted movie. If you are willing to put aside all logic and common sense and treat it as pure escapism, then it is a very entertaining movie.   Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood lead a group of commandos on a mission to rescue a captured American general held in a highly fortified and remote castle held by the Germans in WWII. Mary Ure and Ingrid Pitt join the gang along the way. The are more twists and turns in the story than in a German pretzel factory. Double crosses and triple crosses abound.   There are the usual stereo-typical Germans, the ruthless Gestapo officer, the stern commander, the visiting General and tons of German soldiers. No problem, ole Clint mows down a whole battalion single handedly. Burton cuts down a company or two himself and both he and Eastwood emerge with nary a scratch. And those portable bombs..how did they manage to pack so many and manage to get them so strategically placed that no one finds them?   'Where Eagles Dare' reminds me of the old Saturday Afternoon serials...with a budget.",7,2,3,23 June 2001
The Fly," Hey...Your Fly Is Down!
","Not for the squeamish, this retelling of the 1958 classic is to say the least, a little bit more gory than the original.A young scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) tries to entice a journalist Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis) back to his place to see his laboratory. She at first is not impressed but when Seth demonstrates his transporting device to her, she is amazes and immediately wants to report it to the public. Seth follows her to her editor Stathis Borans (John Getz) and all agree to delay the report.Back at Seth's place the two inevitably fall into the sack and begin to become involved. When Seth successfully transports a baboon from one station to the other, the pair become ecstatic and open a bottle of champagne. Seth meanwhile has become jealous of Borans and while Veronica is away at the office becomes upset to the point of transporting himself in his devices. Unfortunately, he doesn't notice a common house fly in the chamber with him. Uh Oh!When Seth emerges from the transporting devices, he at first feels normal. But soon he appears to gain strength and mobility and becomes a tireless lover. Veronica discovers some hair like growth on Seth's back. Gradually Seth begins to take on the characteristics of a fly and realizes that something went wrong with his experiment. His appearance begins to change drastically with Veronica becoming more and more fearful.Veronica learns that she has become pregnant with Seth's child and wants to abort it fearing what might result from the birth. There is a particularly gross dream sequence here where Veronica imagines the birth of her child.Seth who has re-named himself the 'Brundlefly', breaks into the doctor's office where Veronica has gone for her abortion and steals her away returning to the lab. Borans goes with shot gun in hand to rescue her and............................................................ This is the real gory part. The sequence where the Brundlefly attacks Boranis is particularly gross.Although very upsetting, this picture is well done for this type of horror. David Cronenberg was noted for his attention to detail hence the various makeups and prosthetics used in the fly's transformation. Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis are excellent in their roles going from star crossed young lovers to the horrors that await them. Watch for Canadian Heavyweight legend George Chuvalo as the man Seth arm wrestles in the bar.Just a couple of questions. Where did Seth get all the money to finance his experiments? And what happens to Veronica afterward? Just asking.Be afraid....really afraid.",8,1,1,29 November 2018
From Hell," Jack the Ripper Strikes Again!
","Albert and Allen Hughes have given us yet another retelling of the saga of Jack the Ripper. They have created a dark and dreary setting of the White Chapel district of 1888 London in which to tell their story. When the murders begin, Detective Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp) is called in. He is an unusual sort who has 'visions' while under the influence of opium. In fact we first meet him when his assistant Sgt. Godley (Robbie Coltrane) fetches him out of an opium den. Abberline soon sees a pattern develop in the killings and determines that the killer is systematically murdering a circle of prostitutes for some unknown reason. Among the 'ladies' is Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) with whom he eventually falls in love. Abberline seeks help from famous surgeon (Ian Holm) who explains the technical aspects of the murders. Thwarting him for apparent political reasons is his superior (Ian Richardson). There are enough of twists and turns in the plot to hold the viewer's interest. There are also several gruesome and realistic murders, lobotomies and a resolution that make come as a shock to some. Not for the squeamish.",8,0,1,19 May 2002
Total Recall," Was It All Just a Dream?
","'Total Recall' is an expensive futuristic Sci-fi film in which Arnold Schwarzeneggar saves Mars.The story opens Douglas Quaid (Arnold) dreaming of walking hand in hand with a mysterious brunette (Rachel Ticotin) on Mars and then waking beside his wife Lori (Sharon Stone). Quaid has a desire to move to Mars but Lori is against it. Stuch in a menial construction job (you know that that's not going to last), Quaid is lured by an advertisement of a virtual holiday on Mars from a company known as Recall.Quaid chooses to experience his 'vacation' as a super spy with all of the inherent dangers. Then all hell breaks loose. The virtual machine malfunctions and Quaid suddenly finds himself pursued by unknown assailants. It seems that Quaid may have had his memory erased and that Lori isn't really his wife but an enemy agent.Anyway, he manages to get to Mars where he discovers that his main adversaries are Cohaagen (Ronny Cox), who controls the settlement, its air and its wealth and his chief henchman Richter (Michael Ironside). He also discovers 'the girl of his dreams', Melina (Ticotin) who seems to remember him as someone called Hauser. It seems that 'Hauser' still holds some valuable information in his scrambled brain.After dispatching half the population, Arnold brings the villains to justice and all live happily ever after....or do they?Director Paul Verhoeven gives us plenty of action, great looking set pieces and plenty of extras for Arnold and company to mow down. The fight between Stone and Ticotin is a highlight as well as, the part where Stone kicks the crap out of Arnold. Verhoevan also leaves it to the viewer to decide whether the story was real or did Arnold actually have his virtual vacation.Exciting science fiction.",7,0,0,27 June 2007
The Untouchables," Powerful Gangster Drama!
","'The Untouchables' is arguably Director Brian De Palma's greatest film. He managed to assemble a top drawer cast to tell his story of Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) and The Untouchables quest to stem crime in Chicago during prohibition and bring down crime kingpin Al Capone (Robert De Niro).Eliot Ness is appointed by the FBI to coordinate efforts to stop the corruption and crime in 1930 Chicago. His first raid is a disaster, the crooks having been warned by corrupt police officials led by Police Chief Mike Dorsett (Richard Bradford). Ness despondent over his failure has a chance meeting with honest cop Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery) and asks him to join him. Reluctant at first, Malone eventually decides to join Ness' crusade. FBI accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith) is assigned to Ness and discovers that Capone hasn't paid any income taxes for several years. Rounding out the team is gung ho police rookie George Stone (Andy Garcia).When Ness refuses a bribe form a city alderman, the alderman gives the group it's name, 'The Untouchables'. The group begins to raid known liquor warehouses with great success. Capone meanwhile, disciplines one of his men with a baseball bat. The boys, with the help of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) foil the smuggling of bootleg liquor across the border. Malone's 'questioning' of one of the crooks is memorable.Capone now begins to take Ness seriously and orders him killed. Wallace is gunned down while transporting a prisoner. Malone learns that Capone's accountant, who has all of the names and places of public officials on the take, will be leaving town by train. In one of the film's most memorable sequences, Ness goes after the bookkeeper. As the shooting begins, a baby carriage with a baby inside begins to roll down a steep staircase and....................................Although Kevin Costner made a convincing Eliot Ness, he was up against some powerful performances. Connery literally steals the picture as the honest Irish cop. He won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his efforts. De Niro eats up the screen as Capone ans Charles Martin Smith is excellent as the accountant turned G-Man. Andy Garcia was just emerging as a major player and holds his own with this high level talent.At the border crossing sequence, Ness refers to the leader of the Mounties as 'Captain'. I would be remiss, if I didn't mention the fact that there are NO Captains in the RCMP (there's called Inspectors) and they don't all speak with Englisg accents....and they DO have police cars.One of the all time great gangster pictures.",8,2,4,16 July 2007
Enemy at the Gates," Exciting Realistic Battle Scenes
","'Enemy at the Gates' is a WWII drama that takes place during the German siege of Stalingrad in 1942. Director Jean-Jacques Annaud stages realistic and convincing battle scenes amid the ruins of a great city. The scenes where the peasant soldiers are forced into a suicidal battle with few arms is particularly gruesome and unforgettable. From the ranks of the peasant soldiers comes a deadly sharpshooter named Vassili,(Jude Law) who through a fateful encounter meets an influential Russian information officer, Danilov (Joseph Fiennes)who in turn brings his particular talents to the attention of Nikita Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins). Vassili is then developed into a national hero for his exploits as a propaganda measure to improve the morale of the Russian people. The Germans counter with their own sharpshooter Major Konig (Ed Harris) who is sent in to take out Vassili. The rest of the movie is essentially a cat and mouse game between Law and Harris. A totally unnecessary love triangle develops between Vasilli, Danilov and Tania (Rachel Weisz). Law and Weisz give us a graphic demonstration of 'love among the ruins' along the way. Law conveys too much baby-faced innocence to be convincing as a cold-blooded assassin. Harris, on the other hand, is thoroughly believable in his role. He unfortunately has to perform the requisite evil German act near the end of the story, which I thought was totally unnecessary for his character within the context of the story. Fiennes is good as the ambitious Danilov but Weisz is not believable as a female scholar/sharpshooter. Hoskins does a nice turn as the overbearing Khrushchev. Ron Perlman has a brief bit as Koulikov another Russian sharpshooter. 'Enemy at the Gates' is good war movie. The conflict between the Law and Harris characters is riveting. But the movie suffers with the love story and the contrived 'happily ever after' Hollywood ending.",7,0,1,27 October 2001
A Beautiful Mind," A Beautiful Mind - A Beautiful Movie
","'A Beautiful Mind' took home four major Academy Awards for 2001. It deservedly won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress and Best Screenplay (Adaptation). It is the story of John Nash who is a brilliant mathematician whose life becomes a nightmare when he descends into the scary and uncertain world of a paranoid schizophrenic. Producer Brian Grazer, Director Ron Howard and Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman show us the world of a schizophrenic from the patient's point of view as Nash's world alternates between reality and and imagined reality. The audience shares his suffering and also does not know what situations and /or characters are real or imagined. Russell Crowe, in an outstanding performance, plays Nash with conviction and believability. Jennifer Connelly is his long-suffering wife Alicia who sticks with him and provides the support he so desperately needs. Christopher Plummer plays Dr. Rosen the psychiatrist who tries to help Nash. Ed Harris is excellent as Nash's contact in the Defence Department where Nash works de-coding hidden messages..or does he? Paul Bettany is Martin Hansen Nash's college roommate and Vivien Cardone his niece who Nash turns to for comfort. Adam Goldberg and Anthony Rapp are two of Nash's college classmates who he also meets from time to time over the years and who help Alicia in coping with Nash's behavior. Judd Hirsch plays Nash's college professor and watch for Roy Thinnes in a blink of an eye appearance as the Governor. 'A Beautiful Mind' is a beautiful movie, not for everyone, but a rare insight into the confusing world of a schizophrenic. A true classic.",9,0,2,9 August 2002
Psycho," 12 Rooms...12 Vacancies!
","'Psycho', in my humble opinion, is the best of Director Alfred Hitchcock's films. It has everything that you would want in a thriller love making, theft, fear, murder tension and unexpected twists. It's divided into three parts, the theft of the $40K, the aftermath of the first murder and the solution of the crime.Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a secretary to a real estate agent George Lowry (Vaughn Taylor). Marion has been meeting boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin) for some 'afternoon delight'. They are unable to marry due to Loomis large alimony payments. Lowry has been selling a home to Tom Cassidy (Frank Albertson) and the two have been out celebrating the sale. Cassidy insists on paying the $40K sale price in cash and brings the money to the office.Marion is asked to take the cash to the bank, She asks for the rst of the day off and decides to yield to temptation and flees with the money. She heads for the California town of Fairview (I think) the home of Loomis and his hardware store. On the way Marion pulls over to the side of the road to rest.The next morning a Highway Patrol Officer (Mort Mills) in sinister reflective sun glasses questions her. He becomes suspicious of her nervousness. In the next town, Marion pulls into a used car lot and trades her car in. The salesman Charlie (John Anderson) is curious as to why she is in such a hurry. The Highway Patrolman pulls up opposite the car lot and unnerves Marion.Marion proceeds on her way and gets caught up in a rain storm. Only miles away from her destination, she pulls off the road into an out of the way motel...'The Bates Motel' There she is greeted by a personable Norman Bates who checks her into her room. Norman offers to make a snack for Marion. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother. When Norman returns, Marion tries to talk the momma's boy Norman into leaving the abusive old lady. He refuses. However in telling each other their troubles, Marion sees the error of her theft and plans to return the money the next day.Marion with a clear conscience, decides to take a relaxing shower when a shadowy figure creeps into the bathroom and unexpectedly murders her. Norman back at the house on the hill, sees blood on his mother mnad rushes to Marion's room. He is shocked at what he finds but decides to protect his mother nad cleans up the crime scene. He places Marion's body in her car and sinks it in a bog behind the motel.A week later, Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) arrives at Sam's store trailed by private investigator Arbogast (Martin Balsam). They both are concerned over Marion's disappearance and feel that she is hiding somewhere in town. They soon realize that something more serious has occurred. They go to local sheriff Al Chambers (John McIntyre) for help. They explain the situation. He informs them that Norman's mother has evidently been dead these past ten years.Arbogast, hired by Lowry, checks all the local hotels for a trace of Marion and ultimately arrives at the Bates Motel. He becomes suspicious of the nervous Norman and decides that he will try to interview Norman's mother. As he goes up the staircase in the house he receives a big surprise.When Arbogast fails to return, Lila and Sam decide to visit the Bates Motel themselves. They immediately become suspicious. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house in search of Mrs. Bates. Norman overpowers Sam and races to his mother's aid. Lila is searching the creepy old house and descends into the basement when Norman returns. What she finds is the answer to Norman's secret.I envy anyone seeing 'Psycho' for the first time and experiencing the shocks provided by Mr. Hitchcock for the first time. I mean, how in how many films is the leading lady murdered early in the story?The performances are universally great with Perkins standing out. Leigh and Miles give strong feminine interpretations to their roles. The film is populated with top character actors of the day. In addition to those already mentioned, we have Simon Oakland as the psychiatrist who explains all, Lurene Tuttle as Mrs. Chambers and Pat Hitchcock as Marion's co-worker. And watch for Alfred Hitchcock's cameo at the beginning of the movie.And the score by Bernard Hermann............WOW! It's just like another character in the movie.Followed by two sequels and a TV movie over twenty years later.",10,1,1,7 May 2020
To Kill a Mockingbird," And the Oscar Goes to............!
","What can I add to the already glowing reviews of this wonderful film. It gave star Gregory Peck a long overdue Oscar as Best Actor of 1962. He had the good fortune to have been given an excellent supporting cast which only added to the film's brilliance. It should be noted that there were no other so-called stars in the cast, unusual for a Peck film.The story, adapted from the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Harper Lee, is one of a small town country lawyer who is asked to do his civic duty by defending a black man accused of rape, a sensitive topic for films of that time.Atticus Finch (Peck) is a widower with two young children, Scout (Mary Badham) and Jem (Phillip Alford) going about their daily business when Judge Taylor (Paul Fix) asks Atticus to take on a case, which no one else will touch, of a black man Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) who is accused of raping the young daughter (Collin Wilcox) of red necked farmer Bob Ewell (James Anderson).The trial proceeds and Atticus casts reasonable doubt on the guilt of the defendant. Even so, the jury finds Robinson guilty and.................................................The film is essentially divided into three parts. The first part follows the children and their friend Dill Harris (John Megna) in their summer pursuits. The second and central part of the film is the court room sequence. The final part is the aftermath of the trial including the children's encounter with the neighborhood bogey man Boo Radley (Robert Duvall).There are several performances of note here. Peck of course was never better. He considered the role of Atticus Finch as his personal favorite of all of his roles. His easy going but authoritative manner both with his children and in the court room are a sight to behold. Mary Badham and Phillip Alford were not professional actors when hired but turn in great performances as Finch's children.James Robinson is positively scary as the red necked farmer Ewell who accuses Tom of rape. His confrontation scene with Peck is memorable. Collin Wilcox as Mayella Violet Ewell, the 'victim' almost steals the court room scene as does the touching performance by the great black actor Brock Peters as the doomed accused.Robert Duvall in one of his earliest films, plays Boo Radley without uttering a word. He does it all with facial expressions from fear to compassion to understanding. Also, using his facial expression to advantage is veteran character actor Richard Hale as Nathan Radley, Boo's father as he cements up a hole in the tree where Boo had left small items for the children.And much is made on the DVD commentary by Producer Alan J. Pakula and director Robert Mulligan on the cutting of the part of Ruth White as the wheelchair bound Mrs. Dubose to one short scene. If it was that good, surely they could have found a way to keep it in. And why was it not included on the DVD?Others in the strong cast include William Windom as the prosecuting attorney, Frank Overton as the Sheriff, Estelle Evans as the Fich housekeeper Calpurnia and Rosemary Murphy as neighbor Maudie Atkinson.If I have any criticism of the film it is the very obvious studio bound 'exteriors' which take away from the film's authenticity. Nevertheless, this is a film that seem to get better with age.",9,0,1,3 October 2016
The Green Mile," Jailhouse Rock!
","'The Green Mile' is another jailhouse movie adapted from a novel written by Stephen King. It's not a horror movie although there are some gruesome scenes within.Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) is the head of a group of prison guards in charge of death row in a Louisiana State Prison. The story chronicles their day to day activities and interactions with the prisoners. One day a huge but mild mannered black prisoner John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) convicted of murdering two little girls. Smart ass guard Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchinson) makes fun of the giant.Edgecomb and his co-workers Brutus Howell (David Morse), Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper) and Harry Terwilliger (Jeffrey DeMunn) along with Wetmore are charged with executing prisoners on their assigned date. A 'dry run' with trustee Toot-Toot (Harry Dean Stanton) standing for the convicted prisoner is carried out to ensure that everything is in order. The first execution is that of Arlen Bitterbuck (Grahame Green) which is carried out according to law.Later, a rebellious prisoner named 'Wild Bill' Wharton (Sam Rockwell) is brought in. He is truly rotten and unrepentant. A small mouse is running rampant within the block. Wetmore promises to eliminate the rodent. However, another prisoner Eduard (Del) Delacroix (Michael Jeter) takes a liking to the mouse and names him Mr. Jingles.Edgecomb has been suffering from an painful urinary disorder, Coffey and Edgecomb have developed a mutual respect for each other. One day Coffey grabs Edgecomb and for the want of a different term, 'mind melds' with him. Edgecomb to his surprise discovers that the pain is gone and that he can one again function as a man, much to the delight of his wife Jan (Bonnie Hunt).As Del's execution date approaches, Mr. Jingles escapes and is crushed under the foot of Wetmore. Del is totally distraught but Coffey asks that the seemingly dead mouse be brought to him. He manages to revive the mouse much to the amazement of all. Later, as Del is led away to the execution chamber, Wetmore plans a particularly gruesome finish for Del. Edgecomb and the others are upset of the way Del died but are unable to remove Wetmore due to his 'connections'.Warden Hal Morris (James Cromwell) is a friend of Edgecomb. Morris's wife (Patricia Clarkson) is suffering from a brain tumor. Edgecomb impressed bt Coffey's apparent powers, hatches a plan to bring Coffey to Morris' home. He manages to do so and Coffey is able to cure the ailing woman.As Coffey's execution date nears, he has first a score to settle with Wetstone and Wharton which is accomplished in an unusual way. Later in another 'mind meld' with Edgecomb, Edgecomb learns of Coffey's situation through a flash back and learns who the real murderer was.An impeccable cast right from Tom Hanks right down to veteran character actor Dabbs Greer who play Hanks at an advanced age. Sam Rockwell stands out as the hateful 'Wild Bill' Wharton as does Doug Hutchinson as the truly unlikeable Percy Wetmore. Michael Jeter, whose execution scene is truly graphic, also stands out. William Sadler also appears as the distraught father of the slain girls and Gary Sinese as Coffey's defence attorney.A truly marvelous film.",9,0,1,27 April 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," We've Got to Get Out of This Place!
","At this writing I see that there is already 6,329 reviews of 'The Shawshank Redemption' on IMDb so what the heck, I'll throw in my two cents worth.'The Shawshank Redemption' was adapted from a Stephen King novelette about a wrongly convicted murderer's 19 year odyssey through Shawshank prison in Maine. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to prison for the murder of his wife and her lover. We don't learn until later that he really was innocent. Andy is taken under the wing of veteran lifer Red Redding (Morgan Freeman) who shows him the ways of prison life.Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is a strict Bible thumper who together with his sadistic Captain of the Guards Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown), maintain order within the prison. A convict named Bogs (Mark Rolston) sets his sights on Andy for homosexual purposes. Andy is continuously attacked by Bogs and his friends. While working on a roof top, Andy overhears Hadley's complaints over taxes on a small inheritance. Andy tells Hadley of a way in which he can avoid any taxes. As his 'fee' Andy asks for beer for his co-workers which puts him favor with the group. Later, when Bogs and his gang rough up Andy, Hadley beats Bogs to a pulp and renders him a parapalygic.Warden Norton sees possibilities in Andy and re-assigns him to the prison library being run by lifer Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore). Andy through an exhaustive letter writing campaign, manages to gain funding from the state to expand the library along with a supply of used books. Andy does Income taxes for the guards and tutors some prisoners as well. Norton is impressed Under a scheme where prisoners are loaned out to the community for work on public projects, Norton develops a kick back scheme and employs Andy to keep the books for him.A young convict named Tommy (Gil Bellows) comes to the prison and after gaining the confidence of Andy and Red, tells a tale of a prisoner that he had shared a cell with who admitted to killing Andy's wife and lover. Andy goes to Warden Norton to seek a new trial. Norton not wanting to lose Andy because of his accounting skills, refuses to help him. An argument ensues and Andy is thrust into solitary.When he is released from solitary, Andy becomes distant and becomes a loner. What he is really doing is hatching an elaborate frame-up of Norton and his cronies while also planning to escape. One morning g at roll call Andy does not answer and......................................................................................This film deservedly was nominated for seven Academy Awards. The acting is superb. Robbins and Woodward are tremendous as the two main characters. Gunton and Brown are great as the main villains. But veteran James Whitmore almost steals the movie with his sympathetic portrayal of the paroled lifer who tries to adjust to society after 50 years in prison.A great movie.",9,0,0,18 April 2019
Halloween," The Ultimate Boogeyman!
","'Halloween' has become a classic of sorts over the years. Independently produced for $300,000, it has spawned several imitations and a series of inferior sequels. Made by the team of Debra Hill and John Carpenter it provides all the thrills and scares one could hope for. Although it is thought of as a slasher movie, there is nary a drop of blood to be seen. The violence although graphic is handled for the most part in the viewers imagination. You see the thrust of a knife but do not see the actual stabbing.The film opens on Halloween, 1963 with a 6 year old Michael Myers stabbing his older sister to death following a romantic encounter with her boyfriend. Fast forward 15 years where we meet Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) on his way to the asylum where Michael Myers has been kept. We learn that Myers has not spoken in all that time and that he is the embodiment of evil with 'the eyes of the devil'.On arriving at the asylum Loomis learns that Myers has escaped. He steals the very car in which Loomis had been travelings and flees. Loomis believes that Myers will return to his home town and alerts authorities there.Myers surely does return to the scene of the crime (on Halloween night, wouldn't you know) and there begins to stalk three young girls, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), Annie Brackett (Nancy Loomis) and Lynda van der Klok (P.J. Soles). Laurie and Annie are to baby sit that night with Lynda and her boyfriend to join Annie and her boyfriend later. Loomis meanwhile stakes out the old Myers house awaiting Michael.Myers lurks about the house where Annie is babysitting. When she leaves to pick up her boyfriend, she becomes Myers first victim. Later Lynda and her boyfriend Bob Simms (John Michael Graham) arrive at the now empty house. After some 'under cover' work, Lynda sends Bob down to the fridge for a couple of beers and....... Lynda awaits Bob but....... Then Myers turns his attention to Laurie and (gasp!)...the children.Carpenter builds the suspense slowly. No murders takes place in the first two thirds of the film. He slowly introduces the Myers character (called 'the Form' in the credits), by having him stalk the girls. Only Laurie actually sees him briefly before he disappears. And of course the others do not see the menace and think Laurie is imagining it. The fun starts after dark as 'The Ultimate Boogeyman' goes to work.A word about Carpenter's haunting theme. Almost a character itself it is played over the entire film and anyone has heard it will never forget it. A better horror theme has yet to be written.The character of Michael Myers is portrayed by Nick Castle a friend and co-worker of Carpenter who would go on to be a successful director himself. For Curtis, this was her first film and type cast her for a time as a horror icon.The mask worn by the Myers character was actually a mask of William Shatner as Captain Kirk of 'Star Trek' fame, modified for the Myers character.",9,0,1,31 October 2006

Tombstone," Superb Telling of the Wyatt Earp Saga
","'Tombstone' deals with the adventures of Wyatt Earp and his brothers covering a two and one half year period. It starts with Wyatt (Kurt Russell) and his two brothers (Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton) arriving in Tombstone to seek their fortune. Subsequent events put badges back on the Earps and lead to the infamous gunfight at the OK Corral. The last third of the film deals with Wyatt's revenge on the baddies, known as 'The Cowboys'. Director George P. Cosmatos gives us a visually stunning film. From the spectacular sunsets/sunrises to the real lightning flashes and authentic settings and costumes. Most of the male actors are hidden under real beards and handle bar moustaches they grew which were common at the time of the story. The performances are excellent all around. Russell makes an excellent Wyatt. The relationship between Wyatt his brothers and Doc Holiday (Val Kilmer) are developed in detail. Kilmer plays Holiday as a former southern aristocrat complete with accent and mannerisms. Joanna Pacula plays his girlfriend. Dana Wheeler-Nicholson is good as Wyatt's drug addicted first wife and Dana Delaney looks stunning as the 'other woman'.  Heading up the villains are Powers Boothe as Curly Bill, Michael Biehn as Ringo and Stephen Lang and Thomas Haden Church as the Clantons. Wyatt Earp's grandson Wyatt Earp III plays Billy Claiborne. Veteran western performer Harry Carey Jr. does a nice turn as the town marshal and Buck Taylor (of 'Gunsmoke' fame) plays one of Wyatt's marshals. Charlton Heston puts in a cameo as a rancher and look for Billy Bob Thornton as a saloon bully early in the film. 'Tombstone' ranks in my opinion, as the best and most accurate version of the Wyatt Earp saga ever filmed. Try and catch the director's cut (at 134 minutes) which restores many of the cut sequences from the original version and serves to provide further clarification to the development of the characters and their relationships with one another.",9,0,0,23 January 2002

On the other hand, if you don't like dark, dreary and a rain soaked scenario, I suggest that you move on.The scene is 2019 in a futuristic Los Angeles (as seen from 1982) where there is little or no sunlight, rain soaked streets, flying cars, urban trash and people coming and going in every direction.A group of life like androids known as replicants have taken over a ship at an off-world colony and murdered the crew. The replicants who have a limited life span and were being used as slave labor, have returned to earth seeking their 'creator' to attempt to have him prolong their lives.Enter Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) a retired Blade Runner (a cop who terminates replicants) who is called out of retirement by sleazy police official Bryant (M. Emmett Walsh) and his creepy assistant Gaff (Edward James Olmos) to terminate the four replicants who are at large. The first, Leon Kowalski (Brion James) we meet in the opening sequence where he kills the research doctor who was testing him.Deckard begins the hunt by first meeting with 'creator' Dr. Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel) the genius who devised the replicant program. He also meets his assistant Rachael (Sean Young) who turns out to be a more advanced replicant with more human like feelings. Deckard at first denies his true feeling but eventually an attraction builds between them.Deckard is attacked by Kowalski who as he is about to kill Deckard is himself killed in an unexpected way. Deckard tracks down Zhora (Joanna Cassidy) another replicant and brutally shoots her down if full view of the public. That leaves Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) and Pris (Daryl Hannah) as the two remaining replicants at large.Batty has Pris seduce the mild mannered genius J.F. Sebastian (William Sanderson) in order to have him arrange a meeting with Dr. Tyrell. The meeting takes place and............................................................This film has had a number of different versions over the years. The original release ran 128 minutes and the 'final version' released in 2007 runs 117 minutes. There were I think, a couple of other versions around as well until Director Ridley Scott supervised the full restoration of the film to the 'final version'.Harrison Ford's performance in the leading role is well, Harrison Ford. Rutger Hauer makes a scary villain but elicits sympathy in the end. Daryl Hannah with those long legs, makes a sexy alternative to Hauer.Followed by a sequel set thirty years after 'Blade Runner' called 'Blade Runner 2049' released in 2017.",7,2,4,15 February 2018
Identity," Thinker's Thriller!
","When you watch 'Identity', you immediately think of Agatha Christie's 'Ten Little Indians'. While its similar in theme, Director James Mangold adds some interesting psychological twists. The story is essentially about ten strangers who are thrown together at a seedy motel on a rainy night somewhere in Nevada. First we meet the motel manager Larry (John Hawkes) who is contemplating a slow night as he gulps down another glass of whiskey. At various stages arrive, the York family, George (John C. McGinley), his wife Alice (Leila Kenzle) who has been involved in an accident, and their young son Timmy (Bret Loehr). They are followed by a limo driver Ed (John Cusack), his passenger an over the hill actress (Rebecca De Mornay) and a hooker Paris (Amanda Peet) whom they picked up on the road. Also taking refuge from the storm is a newly married couple Ginny (Clea DuVall) and Lou (William Lee Scott). Finally a police officer Rhodes (Ray Liotta) and his prisoner (Jake Busey) arrive. Suddenly, gruesome murders begin happening as the ten begin to turn up dead one by one, by one means or another. The comment element is that room keys in descending order from 10 to 1 are found on each of the victims. The murderer remains a mystery although you may have your own suspect(s). Running parallel to this story is one about a last minute hearing for a convicted mass murderer Malcolm Rivers (Pruitt Taylor Vince) in a chilling performance, who is to be executed the next day. His psychiatrist Dr. Malick (Alfred Molina) is trying to convince a judge (Holmes Osborne) that his patient was not responsible for the crimes that he was accused of due to newly discovered evidence. What this has to do with the main story becomes clearer as the movie progresses. The acting in this movie is top notch from top to bottom and the direction is excellent. I'll give you a little advice though. Pay attention to the opening credit sequence. It will help explain things once you have seen the ending. The DVD release has an alternate ending with an additional scene but it adds little to an already exciting thriller.",7,0,1,31 October 2003
The Wizard of Oz," Judy! Judy! Judy!
","The all time favorite children's classic that has stood the test of time (80 years at this writing). Only MGM with it's vast resources could have undertaken such a massive project. It took six different directors to bring it to the screen with victor Fleming taking the credit.'The Wizard of Oz' is the story of a wide eyed young girl named Dorothy (Judy Garland) and her fantasy visit to the mythical land of Oz where she meets several characters that have gone on to be legendary.Dorothy lives on a dusty little farm somewhere in Kansas with her Auntie 'Em (Clara Blandick) and Uncle Henry (Charlie Grapewin) and their three farm hands, Hunk (Ray Bolger), Zeke (Bert Lahr) and Hickory (Jack Haley). She is having trouble with local busy body Miss Gulch (Margaret Hamilton) who wants to take her dog Toto away for digging up her garden. When Miss Gulch arrives to take Toto away the dog escapes and returns to Dorothy. Dorothy decides to run away to escape 'the old witch'.As she walks down the road, Dorothy comes upon Professor Marvel (Frank Morgan) who advises her to return home just as a fierce storm approaches. She arrives back at the farm to find that the others have taken shelter and she is unable to join them. As the tornado blows in, Dorothy is knocked unconscious and begins to dream.She dreams that the farm house is taken by the wind and dropped (on the wicked witch of the east) in a magical land called Oz. There she meets good witch Glinda (Billie Burke) who introduces her to the munchkins a group of little people who immediately hail Dorothy as a hero fro having disposed of the wicked witch of the east. The wicked witch of the west (Hamilton) suddenly appears and threaten to 'get you my pretty'. Dorothy becomes frightened and wants to return home. Glinda counsels her to travel to the land of Oz and ask the Wizard of Oz for help. So, she's off to see the Wizrd.Along the way, Dorothy meets a scarecrow (Bolger) who has no brain and decides to join Dorothy on her journey. Next they meet a Tin Man (Haley) who needs lubrication and a heart. He joins the other two. The Wicked Witch appears and again threatens Dorothy. As the trio moves along, they meet up with a cowardly lion (Lahr) who lacks courage. He joins up with the others and off they go down the yellow brick road.Arriving at Oz they have to get by the Gatekeeper (Morgan) to gain entry. On entering the city they are taken by carriage driven by a driver (Morgan again) to the Wizard's castle. The guard (Morgan again) eventually admits them where they finally encounter the Wizard (you guessed it, Frank Morgan). He sends them on a mission to capture the Wicked Witch's broom and bring it back to him whereupon he will bestow a brain upon the scarecrow, a heart upon the Tin Man and a badge of courage upon the cowardly lion.Unfortunately, Dorothy and Toto are captured by the witch but Toto manages to escape. The scarecrow, tin man and lion go to rescue them and......................................................................Shirley Temple, who was a bigger star than Garland at the time was considered for the role of Dorothy. She at the age of 10 was more age appropriate for the part.. Garland was 16 at the time and although too old for the part, had a better singing voice and anyway, she was already under contract to MGM. Buddy Ebsen was original cast as the Tin Man but had to withdraw when his lungs became infected by the aluminum dust used in the Tin Man makeup. He can be seen in some of the early promos for the film. In spite of it all, it's hard to imagine anyone other than the final cast in their respective roles.The farm scenes were all shot in sepia and the Oz sequence in glorious Technicolor which has been in recent years, restored to it's original brilliance. The film made a major star out of Judy Garland and the rest as they say is history.",9,0,1,24 October 2019
