Captain Phillips," Bad Meal from ur fav Restaurant
","When Tom Hanks's name appears in the posters of a film, automatically we expect a film above par and pitched with some sharp performances. It has almost become a right to expect a good film when tom Hanks is involved. Add Oscar nominations for the best film actor and supporting actor to the mix, and your expectations hit the sky. But this time it felt like I had just eaten a bad meal from a restaurant that always delivers high quality food. It was cold.Saving grace for the film was the performance of Hanks after he was rescued from the pirates. He was coming to terms with the fact that he will live, and that he has survived a bunch of ruthless pirates. After putting a brave face and facing his odds, it was a privileged to see the emotions getting the better of Captain Phillips. His sharp observation skills and maturity as an actor was evident in the last 5 minutes. If we have seen all the good work done by Tom Hanks over the years, it is not a surprise. He can deliver that with utmost precision, even if we are waking him up at the middle of the night.My disappointment was with the fact that the director and screenwriter could have actually made the film more interesting on many levels. Thrilling if you may... The final stab is the fact that they did not use the talent at their disposal. Sad to see the filmmakers settling for mediocre work. The fear and tension of the sailors on board were not captured by the director. May be he was thinking, 'I have Tom Hanks, nobody will notice anything else'. Well, we noticed that you took the lazy route. For a film that is so much overrated I am giving 5/10, that too for the performances of Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi.",5,1,3,19 March 2014
