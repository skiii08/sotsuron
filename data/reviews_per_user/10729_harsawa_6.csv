Howl's Moving Castle," Not on par with Spirited Away- but still an amazing film.
","I have and always will love Hayao Miyazaki's films. I first descovered him when I saw もののけ姫(US 'Princess Mononoke') when it first hit the cinema. Howl's moving castle is his second adaptation of a novel by the same writer (The first being 'Castle in the sky') and his latest film. It opens fairly quickly with not a lot of time to establish the characters, but then after a few other goes-by-fast events, the movie starts into an acceptable pace. Sophie is a young girl working for a hat-shop in a witch and wizard version of Europe. One of the most well known Wizards- Howl lives inside a giant legged castle, and is commonly believed to come down and steal the hearts (literally) of young and beautiful women. When the watch of the waste comes into the hat shop, after a brief argument of sorts, curses Sophie and turns her into an old woman. She then flees her town to the wastes in hope of finding a way to have the spell broken, and along the way finds a cursed scarecrow whom she asks to find a place to stay- and finds Sophie Howl's castle. When inside she meets Calcifur, a demon of flame who promises her he would break her curse if she freed him from Howl, he uses him as a slave. I do not know how close this adaptation is to the novel, as I have never read it, or even heard of the authors name until recently. This movie is extremely well done, as with Miyazaki's other films, but when it comes to Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, or any of his other films, Howl's moving castle falls short. It's lacking some of what made his original films so unique (Not to say it doesn't have some of that style) and doesn't feel as fresh or interesting as his others.",9,0,1,1 March 2006
Silent Hill," As a fan of the series- I was worried. In the end, I was surprised, there's nothing a fan should be worried about!
","Silent Hill was announced awhile back, and I was afraid it was going to be awful. Even though the previews all looked good, I was still afraid it would be another Doom or Resident Evil. Boy was I wrong! The movie has it's problems, but it still ended up being awesome! It did need a little more appearances from the monsters, and the ending didn't do much for me, but when the monsters did appear, it felt like the games! The town was recreated brick from brick and the story is well written (However there are some plot holes that only fans of the series would be able to fill, so if your a regular movie goer check them out!) and transfers well into a movie, with a few changes that don't harm it much.The movie isn't as creepy as the games, but it does retain a certain amount of that atmosphere we all love. The world shifts and changes, creatures are twisted and yet seem almost human. The special effects are great too! Though some effects (The revenge sequence) were a little too over done. The sound is great! The soundtrack is good, except some of the remixes don't sound as good as they did on the CD's or in the games. Silent Hill is a shocker! A video game movie that isn't B-grade drek that's torture to sit through! It may not be up to the mark, as it will disappoint some, but for me, I was pleasantly surprised!",8,2,4,22 April 2006
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," A brilliant mix of dark humour, haunting visuals, and great music make for one of Tim's best films!
","When I heard that Tim Burton was doing Sweeney Todd, to be honest, I had low expectations. I had no interest in the play, at the time I thought it was nothing more than a story about a couple of killers, a baker and a barber. I had no idea that it was so much more complex, and I am very glad a good friend of mine drug me too it.Yes, there is lots of butchery in this film, but it all goes with reason. The music is excellent, a dark orchestra fills the background with an almost menacing overture in certain parts, and although many of the songs repeat themselves, they find ways to stay fresh or catchy.There is a good dose of horror and black comedy in Sweeney; for example, the ending shot alone will haunt you for a good while, while some numbers, such as Mrs. Lovett and Sweeney's conversation when she figures out how to make good meat pies, will have you rolling. Even if black humour isn't your taste, you might find something to laugh at in this scene or the odd 'By the sea' number which almost blinds you with it's brightness and cheeriness compared to the dark visuals of the rest of the film.There are only a couple downsides I can think of, and they come in the form of some of the performances.For one, Alan Rickman has a hard time hitting notes. He has a fine voice, but it goes off tune sometimes.Other's include the character of the 'Beadle,' who thankfully only has one singing number, but you will want to claw your ears off when he does so.There isn't really anything wrong with the people playing Johanna or Anthony, they sing fine, but they sometimes seem to be a little bland when they aren't singing.On the other hand, the rest of the cast turns out wonderful performances, one notable side attraction is Sacha Baron Cohen, who does an absolutely hysterical portrayal of an Italian barber who runs scams on people.It's a wonderful film, from beginning to end, it looks amazing, sounds amazing, and it lives up to the style with great performances and brilliant direction. What more could you ask for?",10,0,3,29 February 2008
Alien vs. Predator," Possibly one of the worst movies ever made.
","When I heard they were making AvP I was very excited. I have probably spent over 900 hours of my life playing the computer games AvP and AvP 2. Both are some of the finest shooting games ever for the computers. When I went to see this film, I realized that I was the only one remaining in the theater when it was finished. In fact, the theater was full when the movie started. There truly is no plot in AvP. The script isn't even a half of a page long. And there is no predalien. The list can go on and on about how terrible AvP is.The movie is very short, which is the only redeeming quality. Avoid this movie at all costs!! This is most definitely one of the worst, if not the worst movie ever made.",1,3,7,27 August 2005
Moulin Rouge!," A strange, stylish, comedy-turned-romantic-tragedy. It's hard to put it into one genre, but as funny as it is sad, it's simply a must see.
","When I first started Moulin Rouge! I felt like I was on a trip, in fact, I found it so incredibly off I didn't watch it. I couldn't watch it. Too strange. But then a friend of mine convinced me to give it another try, which I did, and I don't regret it. Moulin Rouge! is a hard movie to place, it's hysterically off kilter, it's depressingly sad and emotional, it's musically sensational, and it's definitely different. It tells the story of Christian (Ewan McGregor) a young poet and writer who has come to Paris in search of a job, against his fathers wishes, who warns him that he'll end up wasting his time with a Cancan dancer at the Moulin Rouge, and that there is no such thing as 'freedom, beauty, truth, and above all things, Love.' Which is something that Christian believes in more than anything else. So then,an unconscious Argentinian falls through his roof, along with an artist named Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo) (A real person, so I've heard) and herd of other rather eccentric people, trying to find a good song for their next production (Christian comes up with 'The Hills are Alive') and is then whisked away to the Moulin Rouge, an enormous night club owned by eccentric Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent), the main attraction being his 'Diamond Dogs'. One of his star women, Satine(Nicole Kidman), wows the stage, and is to have a private meeting with a Duke shortly after her act. Well, Christian and Toulouse have already ran into the Duke, and when Zidler points out the duke to Satine, she does not see the Duke, but rather Christian, who instead shows up at the private meeting. Sound weird enough to you? It's even weirder to see. All the music in the movie is great, but if it seems familiar, that's because all but one song (The gorgeous 'Come What May')are remixes of classic rock and stage play songs. It still sounds unique and it all matches the on screen looniness. All though it's established that Moulin Rouge! is a weird movie, it's also a very sad movie. Each character has their own unique charm, and the silliness doesn't totally leave the movie, it stays consistent, but it of course, had to be toned down to make way for the more emotional, and serious main act, which will leave you in tears. I admit, the scenes leading up to the saddest part of the movie do seem unfitting as the end is a hard blow out of a rather exciting scene, but it's clear that the comedic part has made it's end, and it's time for the main act to deal out it's sad story. The movie does what a lot can't: It provides two different stories, that remain consistent with one another. The comedy act almost always hits, with you snickering or even laughing out loud at the overall craziness of the characters, but then the romance act sneaks in, and it's genuine and true, and in some points, even does a collaborative dance with the comedy act, but the romance ends in Tragedy, which severs it's ties with the comedy, though it never loses step. It's a wonderful movie, it's funny, it's sad, it's weird, and I would recommend this movie to anyone.",10,2,5,9 January 2007
War of the Worlds," 'War of the worlds' takes intensity to the next level
","War of the worlds is an amazing film, not revolutionary per se, but amazing. Once the mood is set, it never stops, the atmosphere and level of intensity is amazing. Even at the rare parts where they start lulling you into a sense of safety, it throws something at you that reminds you of what is really happening. As an example, when they're all going to a ferry that's supposed to be taking them all to safety, a train signal starts up, and every one stops, and a flaming train (If you look closely you can even see a human hand hanging from one of the windows) goes by. This isn't the greatest movie ever, and I know many people aren't going to like it, but when it comes to intensity this is the perfect movie for you. This adaptation isn't too amazingly close to the H. G. Welles 1898 novel, but they get the idea down pat and even people who are looking for a near perfect adaptation may not be seriously let down. This film is just a great time to spend at the theaters period, but don't go looking for the best film ever.",7,0,1,14 July 2005
