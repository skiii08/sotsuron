Lucky Number Slevin," The Best Movie of All-Time
","This movie is so confusing and so built-up. That when it unfolds it is the most amazing masterpiece that hits the big screen ever. But thats only my opinion. Slevin is so kick ass in that movie though. The beginning made no sense at first, either did the middle but once you find out what this guy is all about it will have you bouncing off the walls. Very, very, very watchable for you mystery buffs. I can't stress this movie enough to my friends and family and once they seen it they stole it from me. I find no reason why, it's is a great movie. One more time....Watch the Damn movie please.",10,2,6,2 January 2008
