The Hangover," One of the best comedy movies i have seen. GJ
","I have to give this movie a 10 out of 10!!! BEST! So good comedy LMAO! I loved the music in the movie. Good songs, and makes me want to dance and party like the 4 guys SO MUCH! BADASS! SOmeday, i will go to Vegas or at least USA.The movie is very funny, and the best part is when movie ends and those ''credits'' with the photos come on screen. I don't have anything bad to say, really good movie. Definitely check the movie out, very funny and nice comedy. Bradley Cooper was thy beast. So good actor and nice mix of seriousness and fun. And the length is enough, not too long not too short.",9,1,3,14 January 2013
