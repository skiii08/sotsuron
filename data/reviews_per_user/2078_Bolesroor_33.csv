Saturday Night Fever," Stayin' Alive or 'How I Learned To Stop Worrying & Love The Disco Ball'
","'Saturday Night Fever' is easily the best 70's-era New York Italian disco film ever made... but I kid Tony Manero.If you can get past the subcategories there's plenty of Truth to be found here, and John Travolta turns in the best performance of his career as dead-end dance king & leader of the pack. Fighting Italian-Catholic guilt and every socio-economic curse known to man he aspires to make the leap from Brooklyn to Manhattan, where he has a shot at success.Or does he? Director John Badham portrays his lead character as Doomed from Frame One, which makes the escape of the disco sequences all the more intoxicating. This movie was lightning in a bottle: a disco film made at the height of the disco craze decrying the disco culture while supplying disco's greatest hits via the Bee-Gee's based soundtrack. And the music adds a LOT to the movie... the breathy introspection of 'How Deep Is Your Love' makes the subway sequence heartbreaking as 'More Than A Woman' represents Tony falling in love with his dancing partner and the life she represents... and let's not forget the grooving swagger of a little song called 'Stayin' Alive' which opens the movie.Some characters in the film haven't aged well, like the uber-skank Annette (vital organs eventually break) and Troubled Nutso Bobby C. ('She likes the taste of Communion wafers.') And to mistake these characters with real-life Italians/Brooklynites would be a crime. But 'Saturday Night Fever' stands as a lasting- if flawed- snapshot of a particular time, place and culture... and is definitely worth a look.GRADE: B-",Null,0,0,2 April 2009
Scarface," Enjoyable Trash
","Scarface is a fun, bloody, violent, curse-filled gangster movie that has earned a cult following from decades of television. If you haven't seen it I suggest you check it out. Scarface is NOT, however, a good movie in any sense. Brian DePalma's direction is stiff and stagy, the cinematography is poor at best, and then there are the performances. Al Pacino, a great actor by most standards, gives an unbelievably broad and unfocused performance as the title character, speaking in an accent so outrageously bad it provided stand-up comedians with years of material. Robert Loggia is weak and unconvincing as an established kingpin, and Michelle Pfieffer is lousy as 'Latin' siren Elvira Hancock.
Gangster-wannabes seem to love this movie more than anyone else (especially the faux gangsters of the hip-hop generation), and while it is not a good film by any stretch it is a must-see. Two great sequences that come to mind: 1) The Sloppy 'Cocaine Power' montage, in which Tony Montana rakes in the green while marrying his flame and buying a tiger, all to the strains of awful 80's power-pop. 2) Tony sitting alone at the club, drugged-out and bored, watching Octavio, some bizarre Latin puppet-mime, until two hitmen attempt to assassinate him.

Se7en," Absolutely Necessary
","My brother and I were still under 18 when 'Showgirls' was released, so after being denied access on opening night by a ticket boy who thought he was the Terminator we slipped into David Fincher's 'Se7en,' having no idea what it was or what to expect.Surely the best serial killer story of all-time, this was bleak upon dark upon black upon evil. The rain is constantly falling in the crumbling, apocalyptic city, and as sick and brutal as John Doe's grisly murders may be, he's only holding a mirror up to our own guilt and depravity. No one is innocent anymore.I loved the fact that Fincher has no fear of the dark, and that he boldly, bravely lets the movie end unhappily because... because maybe life ends unhappily. I can't speak for you but my life is much closer to chaos than an upbeat TV crime wrap-up: 'The killer confessed and was sentenced to life and Mrs. Mantovanni got her puppies back.' Hang on while I vomit.This is not a perfect film by any means... Fincher was still mastering the craft of storytelling: Paltrow's secret luncheon late in the film raises red flags all over creation, but the crisp cinematography and filthy visuals are a wonder to behold. Pitt and Freeman do everything possible to avoid just another black/white, old/young buddy-cop partnership and its a testament to their abilities that they surely succeed. John Doe shows us serial killing as not just preaching but high art... and he and Fincher get every detail just right: the psychosis of the notebooks, the insanity of the fingerprints, the stained bloody shirt and calculated surrender. Even the Nine Inch Nails track in the titles spoke to the mood of violence and industrial rage that at the time was not only hip but palpable.If you haven't seen it yet get good for a downer, abandon all hope and kiss your loved ones goodbye. Don't worry- you can trust in Fincher, Freeman and Pitt to take you through the best bad dream you'll ever have. Now I gotta go that's UPS at the door.GRADE: A",Null,1,1,18 March 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Fiasco
","'Inglorious Basterds' is a movie so clueless, so sloppy, so jam-packed full of half-ass characters and shock-value violence, so relentlessly terrible that I can't even muster the rage and indignation that most intelligent film fans feel toward Quentin Tarantino.I just pity him.American soldiers engaging in acts of deplorable violence against Nazi soldiers is not only justified- it's hilarious! And admirable. Just look at Hugo Stiglitz' statistics from the 1942-43 season in a flashback segment narrated by Samuel L. Jackson. Yes, Samuel L. Jackson. The idea that we're supposed to derive satisfaction from the torture of Nazis is just as abhorrent as a Nazi relishing the torture of a Jew. Let me tell Quentin something he should have learned in grade school: two loathsome evils do not make a right.Brad Pitt- one of my favorite actors- gives the worst performance of his career as a loudmouth macho bloodthirsty cartoon... I'll never look at him the same way again. He also looked particularly angry... for some reason I get the feeling he and Tarantino didn't quite get along. I can picture Brad slapping him silly between takes. Next time slap harder.Quentin has finally gone off the deep end and become the hack we all feared he would. He doesn't know if he's making a war movie, a parody of a war movie, an outrageous B-movie bloodbath or a documentary about milk & strudel. This is the definitive shrug by an artist who has nothing to say and insists on saying it loud.The one standout in the film is supposed to be Christoph Waltz as Col. Hans Landa, the icy, intelligent, brutally-violent Nazi commander. (There's a character we've never seen before.) His only crime seems to be the masterful use of conversation as an indirect threat of violence. The only reason for this of course is that Tarantino hasn't bothered to create any genuine tension or conflict, so we as an audience are forced to watch characters being forced to listen to Landa's menacing monologues. Dinner with a Nazi is scary enough... but by the time we get to his fifth interrogation I simply stopped caring.Who gets the award for worst stunt casting: human dingleberry BJ Novak from 'The Office' or Mike Myers as British General Winthorp J. Starchington, III? I'd have to give the award to Myers, since his absurd makeup and wandering accent are funnier than Austin Powers on his best day.By the film's finale even the fundamentals of film-making have been abandoned and all sense of reality obliterated. We enter a small French movie theater so full of Nazi officers and SS propaganda that it might as well be Hitler's disco. Quentin has forgotten to introduce key characters earlier in the film, so now he compensates by scrawling their names in on-screen title cards, using hand-drawn arrows to identify them in the crowd shots. (Even with this pathetically sloppy device we have no idea who these people are- or why we should care.) Then Tarantino plays a David Bowie song on the soundtrack that was recorded 40 years after the film takes place! Your guess is as good as mine.A movie this awful does raise a lot of questions: Do most teenage refugees own and operate their own cinema? Are nonstop subtitles good for your eyes? Do war heroes play themselves in motion pictures? Do Nazis kidnap women and buy them dinner? Does Der Fuhrer pay full price for a matin√©e?Does a dying German soldier have just enough energy left to shoot our heroine? Would any high-ranking Nazi ever surrender to enemy soldiers after HE captured THEM? Should you try to masquerade as Italian when you can't speak the language?Was Hitler really gunned down in a movie theater?Of course not.Of course not.GRADE: F",1,176,323,27 March 2010
Stripes," Tell Me Again Why This Is Funny?
","Bill Murray plays an obnoxious slob and Harold Ramis plays an obnoxious Jewish slob. Since these two 'buddies' are merely comic actors in a major motion picture, they decide it will be fun to join the Army in order to annoy their fellow cadets, infuriate their commanding officers, and generally do whatever it takes to wring laughs out a premise that can't possibly fail.Except, of course, the premise fails. Not for one moment do we believe these two are in the Army, since the smarmy grins never fall from their faces. Could they be more aware they're making pretend in a Hollywood movie? And the humorless drill instructors and sitcom-ensemble supporting cast only serve to underscore the stacked deck from which director Ivan Reitman is dealing. He would later direct the brilliant Murray and tolerable Ramis to perfection in the classic 'Ghostbusters,' a movie smart enough take its own premise seriously. 'Stripes' is less a satire of Army life than an elitist, semitic mockery of anyone dumb enough to JOIN the Army. I love Bill Murray but I could not get over my immediate dislike of the two main characters to laugh at anything that happens in this film. Much like the brilliant 'Animal House' the movie runs long, and takes an odd second-act detour as the gang steals a mobile assault vehicle and single-handedly... storms an enemy compound? Wins the war? I forgot because I had stopped caring about these characters long ago.Released fresh on the heels of the far-superior 'Private Benjamin,' 'Stripes' has advertised itself for years as a comedy classic in spite of the fact that no human seems to agree. Ever meet a fan of this movie? Has anybody ever quoted or referenced the film... ever? This was a learning experience for those involved... all would go on to greater things... you will too.GRADE: C-",Null,1,4,17 March 2009
The English Patient," Why Novels Should Be Read
","A good movie based on a novel should have the benefit of a clear back-story, and should be condensed down from the rich, layered characters and events that are the hallmark of great writing.'The English Patient' has none of this. It's the kitchen-sink of motion pictures: every single plot line and detail from the novel seems to have made it to the screen, and it's unwieldy in size and over-reaching in scope.Director Anthony Minghella seems to believe that he is telling a story of epic, Biblical proportions, which of course only serves to make the story LESS meaningful instead of more so. Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas (who is luminous, and the best thing about the movie) play completely unsympathetic characters... whereas a great love story will make you want to know the couple this affair makes you want to get away from these people as quickly as possible.What drives these two together? It wasn't circumstance, or destiny, or the insanity of war, it was lust in the dust- adultery for adultery's sake. Their relationship 'difficulties' then become very difficult to care about. Willem Dafoe shows up in a plot line that goes absolutely nowhere, and Juliette Binoche is Hana, the saintly nurse who feels the need- out of all the thousands of soldiers she's treated- to personally attend to this char-broiled buffoon, for reasons entirely unknown.It was about an hour and-a-half into the film that Indian minesweeper Kip ties Hana into a harness, arming her with a lit flare to illuminate the paintings on the walls as he lifts her high into the air. This was ridiculous, completely out of a place, and an insult to an audience that had already surrendered WAY too much of their time. I've also never seen a movie with more manipulative sound editing... effects are over-exaggerated and inappropriately loud, and the songs feel like a cheap device to elicit emotion.'The English Patient' is an example of why novels are condensed and shortened for filming, why certain characters and plot lines are cut, why the story is simplified. This is a movie made to win awards, not to entertain audiences.GRADE: C-",Null,0,4,25 February 2011
Coffee and Cigarettes," Shooting the Breeze. . .
","Jim Jarmusch's 'Coffee & Cigarettes' is a black & white series of vignettes between people meeting for caffeine & nicotine. And that's exactly how the movie plays... like an afternoon spent with a friend yakking about nothing... or everything. And just like those afternoons, some segments are better than others.The shorts are a mix of styles... some are more glossy Hollywood with a scripted narrative, some feel more improvised or indie-style, and some have a distinctly New York vibe. I'm not sure the film hangs together... I'm not sure it's supposed to. Other reviewers here seem to dislike the movie for not being uniform in tone or coalescing into a grand theme or plot line. But be fair: Jarmusch never promised a wrapped package with interweaving story lines... this isn't a 'Seinfeld.' The joy of an anthology like this is that one chapter can be broad and comedic, and the next can go in a completely different direction. Perhaps some folks would have liked to see a cliff-hanging, on-again/off-again, will-they-or-won't-they love triangle, or maybe even a talking dog with a gangster attitude. They're in the wrong theater.This is a movie I could picture adding to my DVD collection and enjoying in a different way every time I watch it... one day I might love one segment, a year later it's my least favorite. Contemplation is not a bad thing.Neither is black & white... it helps to set the movie's tone of honesty, but unfortunately most people associate B&W with film noir- they think it means a movie is 'dark.' I think it just makes a movie more visceral... the tragedy is more heart-breaking, the comedy more crisp. In the oddball scene featuring Iggy Pop & Tom Waits I just enjoyed watching these two men sitting still in relative quiet in shades of black & white... it emphasizes the lines on Iggy's face from a lifetime of rock living and the furrowed brow on Tom Waits from his years of music/medicine. The slow pace also lets the actors b r e a t h e, so their dialogue is conversation, not characters spitting out exposition to set up the next plot point.My highlights:Strange To Meet You: Steven Wright's deadpan genius meets Roberto Benigni's electric comedian. One of the best in the film.Somewhere In California: Tom Waits and Iggy Pop as unlikely 'chums' who fail to hit it off...Cousins: Cate Blanchett in a dual role as herself and her bitter Australian cousin. Brilliant...Cousins?: Watching the worm turn can be so satisfying...In conclusion I would not recommend this if you don't like offbeat films. But if you are feeling adventurous this is the perfect film to sample... especially on DVD. You can try a chapter, and if it doesn't engage you, CLICK- you can move directly to the next. You'll find something worth watching, at least...Now where is that damn waiter with my coffee? GRADE: B",8,0,1,11 November 2008
Zodiac," Heebies, Meet Jeebies
","David Fincher's 'Zodiac' is the scariest movie I have ever seen. Slasher flicks leave me dry and psycho killers put me to sleep, but somehow, somewhere, this movie crosses the line.While Fincher's earlier 'Se7en' was more dark than frightening, 'Zodiac' tells the TRUE story of the San Francisco serial killer from the 70's who has never been caught. You are left with the knowledge that there is a violent maniac on the loose who can still be anywhere... at anytime...The film shows us police officers and newspaper reporters- who back then knew less about homicide investigation than an average TV viewer does today- blindly and naively corrupt crime scenes, destroy evidence, and inadvertently promote the mystery murderer by agreeing to print his demented manifesto in the newspaper for the terrorized city to read! It might in fact be argued that it was the SFPD's complete bungling of the case that led to the strict set of procedures police follow today. 'Did we have the actual killer in here for questioning and let him go? Are we even close to breaking the case? Is this corpse another victim of the Zodiac killer or was this an unrelated slaying?'Nobody knows, and that's why I won't sleep tonight. Instead of most 'horror' movies that focus on the killer as a deranged superhero or crazed genius, Zodiac is the scariest boogeyman of them all- the one we never meet.I wouldn't suggest following too closely the characters played by Gyllenhaal, Ruffalo or Downey- none of them have an answer. Keep your eyes wide open and try to spot the killer yourself. I literally got goosebumps from watching this real-life nightmare, and as God is my witness I walked around my house making loud noises while checking every room and making sure I had locked the door. This is deep creepiness that gets under your skin and stays there... don't miss it.GRADE: A-",Null,0,2,18 March 2009
Taxi Driver," Man, Marginalized
","I always compare great movies to dreams, and 'Taxi Driver' is no exception. This is a fever-induced nightmare... indulgent coma chow, hallucination... apocalypse of the soul. This movie is about man, marginalized... the inevitable evolution of moral bankruptcy. 'Taxi Driver' has endured to not only inspire other great films (SEE: Fight Club) but to sponsor a real-life assassination attempt. The dreamer waking up from the dream to realize he only exists as another dream...Look what war and the military-industrial complex has done to the city... check out Vietnam vet Travis apply for a job as a cabbie because he can't sleep at night... hear his pathetic attempt at a joke... listen to the simmering score rise and fall, as the rage ebbs and flows through a man at odds with his job, his environment, himself...Women might provide the solution... only our dyslexic Travis tries to defile the madonna and redeem the whore. A politician might have the answer... or he might just be a symbol of the girl who broke your heart. This is a gorgeously disgusting movie. New York at its filthy best. Scorsese doesn't fake a frame... he never has to. He understands Travis as well as DeNiro, and with Paul Schrader's brilliant script we understand him as well. Listen to the fizzing of the alka-seltzer in the diner... laugh at Travis hitting on the popcorn girl at the porno theater... enjoy Jackson Browne on American Bandstand.We create monsters and then stand back in shock, our mouths open in utter surprise: How could this happen? How could a man slip so far out of normal society that he becomes a violent maniac? This is how.GRADE: A",Null,0,1,17 March 2009
Lost in Translation," Lost Lotus
","If you require a digitally-generated explosion every ten minutes to stay involved in a movie you will despise 'Lost In Translation.' If you're ready to watch a subtle, down-beat character story then you will fall in love with this beautiful movie. It's the story of a young wife and a fading film actor who meet and bond while stranded in Japan.Japan might be a metaphor, maybe all of this is metaphor... the movie is a moody tone-poem, and you can allow yourself to exhale and FEEL the characters' feelings: male & female, old & young, famous and anonymous. Bill Murray is brilliantly understated, playing himself, letting you look at the hollow inside the celebrity that we usually choose to ignore. Scarlett Johansson is perfect as the baby girl looking for permission to stop thinking and start living life.While Anna Faris' Cameron Diaz-clone babbles about reincarnation, Bill avoids Scarlett's sexual temptation but insists on leaving her with his life's wisdom. They're two sides of the same coin, and 'Lost In Translation' speaks to anyone who's ever been lonely, or gone soul-searching, or just sometimes find it hard to get to sleep. A gem.GRADE: A",Null,1,2,27 October 2009
Barry Lyndon," Hot Garbage
","I love Stanley Kubrick. '2001' and 'Dr. Strangelove' are two of my all-time favorite films. I also love 'Clockwork Orange,' 'Full Metal Jacket,' and 'Paths Of Glory.' So you can see why I was shocked and disappointed when I finally got around to seeing the stultifying 'Barry Lyndon,' a film so dull and pointless that you'll wonder why he bothered.I'll start with the one positive: the cinematography. The movie is beautifully photographed... every frame is rich, lush, and looks like the box cover of a thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle. That might be enough to salvage a film if the story was told visually, but 'Barry Lyndon' is a movie with little or no narrative. Ryan O'Neal- passive and blank- floats through the picture like Forrest Gump or Benjamin Button: the lights are on but nobody's home. We get no sense of any inner life or personality, and the small amount of character we do glimpse reveals Barry to be a spoiled, selfish coward, and one hardly worthy of such a massively-scaled motion picture.The story follows Barry as he falls in love with his cousin, deserts the Army, lies about his bravery, marries a wealthy widow, cheats on her while squandering her fortune and abuses his stepson. He is an awful, unpleasant person, and Kubrick never seems to figure out WHY we're following the man's life in the first place. Glaring gaps in the plot are filled in by a narrator, who advances the story more in three lines than we get in half an hour of wordless drudgery.Yes, the candlelight scenes are beautiful. Use of the special NASA lens was obviously part of Kubrick's reward for filming the faked moon landings, but this is not a device on which an entire film can rest. It astounds me that there are so few people willing to stand up and say the emperor isn't wearing any clothes. It seems to me that most people declare this movie profound because they feel they're supposed to, because if something looks and sounds like a classic, a masterpiece, then it surely must be... right? Wrong. 'Barry Lyndon' is a dull, plodding, pretentious period piece without any saving graces. Composition of frame and brilliant lighting do not make up for a poor actor playing an unengaging character in a movie that does its best to kill any sense of drama, suspense, humor, and action. This feels almost like a deliberate statement by the great Kubrick to make a movie WITHOUT significance... this is an empty exercise in period photography, and little else. 'None of the grandeur of '2001,' he seems to say, 'none of the shocking violence of 'Clockwork Orange...' Just three solid hours of powdered wigs and blank faces. Any reviewer who says otherwise is a pseudo-intellectual pandering to the ghost of a legend. Don't waste your time.GRADE: D-",1,39,94,22 February 2011
Full Metal Jacket," Best War Film In Movie History
","Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket' is the greatest war film in movie history. The message that 'war is Hell' is an easy one to convey, from the sprawling ego-driven mess of 'Apocalypse Now' to the morally-tortured soldiers of 'Platoon.' But in FMJ Kubrick goes beyond the 'war is hell' message... he takes us THROUGH that hell, all the way down... And in summing up the Vietnam War he manages to sum up all wars- America itself as a war machine- and reveals in the film's final battle that we've really been fighting ourselves all along.The first part of the movie is basic training on Parris Island for the Marine recruits... familiar characters emerge: the hard-as-nails drill instructor, the wiseguy, the screw-up... and we watch the sadistic Sgt. Hartman uses a variety of weapons to recondition the men into bloodthirsty drones, awaiting impatiently the order to kill, which according to the Sgt. is their only mission as soldiers. In a telling piece of dialogue that foreshadows the film's final battle, Sgt. Hartman asks what a famous serial killer and Lee Harvey Oswald have in common.They were both former Marines.With that in mind we watch Gomer Pyle, broken by Hartman's unrelenting attacks and physical abuse, confronting his 'parents' in the bathroom, or 'head.' He spares his Mother Pvt. Joker but kills his Father Sgt. Hartman, immediately after Hartman's ominous line: 'Didn't your Mother & Father give you enough attention?!?' Then Pvt. Pyle kills himself... or does he? Pyle is 're-born hard' as Animal Mother in the second half of the film, the suicide being a bad dream or Animal simply a version of Pyle that managed to complete his basic training; Animal is his ghost, his opposite side of the coin. In the Vietnam sequences we get looks at American soldiers performing for 'Vietnam: The Movie,' and we meet men completely unrecognizable from their non-war personae, looking only to kill and appear macho in front of their fellow soldiers. The mother, or feminine side, to Pvt. Joker prevents him from becoming the same Neanderthal... his helmet may bear the slogan 'Born To Kill,' but he wears a peace symbol on his vest.Finally we come to the end battle, a scene as brilliantly illogical as it is revealing. We have never seen the faces of the soldiers the American troops are fighting... they are only shadows, faceless opposites of the Americans... we are fighting ourselves. As the platoon is drawn in and gunned down by sniper fire a strange coincidence emerges: the troops are caught in a triangular plaza being fired on by a lone gunman from a second story building. If it sounds similar to the JFK assassination, it should... this is Kubrick's re-staging of the key American historical event of the 2oth Century. Just as Oswald was himself a Marine, the troops are being fired on by themselves for all intents and purposes. This is where Kubrick's film works on multiple levels and conveys dual narratives seamlessly.The sniper turns out to be not a Marine but a lone Vietnamese FEMALE, her hair in bows, similar to the style of a Native American. Is this a message on Kubrick's part about ghosts of enemies slain and victims of America's past? She is finally destroyed, in an intimately cruel act by Pvt. Joker himself who, with the firing of one bullet, both rapes and kills the girl, simultaneously killing the 'female' side of himself and becoming a true Marine, a true soldier with no identity or independent thought.The movie ends with the soldiers marching through the burning wreckage of Vietnam, broken men in a ravaged country, singing the theme to 'The Mickey Mouse Club,' gleefully damned and joined as brothers in arms. Kubrick presents the concept of war as total destruction: of land, culture, life, soul... I wish I had more time to get into my interpretations here. Remember, these are just my impressions... watch the movie and judge for yourself.'Full Metal Jacket' is a great film because no other before or since has had the courage to declare war as bloody insanity in which 'winning' is always impossible. You owe it to yourself to see this.GRADE: A",10,0,1,11 June 2009
American Sniper," American Garbage
","'American Sniper' is one of the worst movies I have ever been forced to endure. It is simplistic propaganda masquerading as an award-worthy story. There is no story.American kid Chris Kyle is good at shooting so he uses 9/11 as an excuse to join the Navy SEALS and kill Iraqis. That's it. That's the whole movie. Clint Eastwood's one-dimensional direction shows Chris as some sort of American hero, even though any sane human will at least question the cold-blooded murder of men, women & children in a morally ambiguous war. I'm still not sure how Iraq was responsible for 9/11.Clint tries to humanize our hero by tacking on a subplot about Chris's wife, but this storyline- like the rest of the movie- has NO conflict. Chris meets his prospective wife at a bar, dates her, marries her, impregnates her and starts a family with no trouble whatsoever. Why are we watching this? In the meantime our hero goes back to Iraq to blow the brains out of more women and children, and he doesn't seem to lose any sleep over his work.Back home Chris gets accosted in a Jiffy-Lube by a fellow veteran, and the sequence plays more like a romantic meeting than a heartfelt tribute, as the appreciative vet stares at Chris with moist, dewy eyes while licking his lips. Either way, Kyle is unmoved and displays no emotion. Why are we watching this again?Sienna Miller as Chris' wife cannot stop touching her belly to remind us that she's preggers. The straps of her fake pregnant belly are visible beneath her bra straps. At one point she hands Chris their child and it is very obviously a lifeless, motionless doll. Why are we watching this?If you're looking for any type of character development you won't find it here: Chris Kyle is portrayed as a killing machine without any discernible personality. A fellow officer raises the question of why Chris carries a Bible. 'I've never seen you open it,' he says, and the issue is dropped there. Does Chris believe in God? Does he not? There is no internal life whatsoever.Bradley Cooper does his best to instill this cardboard cutout of a character with some depth, but all he manages to do is say 'Um¬Ö' in a Southern drawl before he speaks every line to remind us that he is indeed from Texas. He meets his brother at an airport and the scene is a crime against acting: there is no connection, no exchange, no conflict. Suddenly Chris decides he wants to come home from the war and stop killing people. He does. Then he is killed by a fellow soldier and Eastwood leaves us with TV footage of the real Chris Kyle's funeral: six SUV's driving down the road while a couple people hold signs. Why?Why was this movie made? What is it supposed to say? Why is this man special, or significant, or evil, or great? Why are we supposed to care about any of this? Why are we watching this? The good news is: you don't have to.GRADE: D-",1,816,1559,19 January 2015
Forrest Gump," Retard Yourself With Retro-Culture!
","If you're like me you hate to think; even worse is thinking about history- so much moral ambiguity, so much perspective and bothersome shades of grey... isn't there a movie out there that can assure me that everything that happened during the latter-half of the twentieth century was Just Fine- all while deafening me with jukebox favorites?Now you can! Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks proudly present 'Forrest Gump' a left-wing work of right-wing propaganda that boldly proclaims the mentally retarded are not just AS GOOD as you and me, but better! And as a result, American Heroes! Forrest's IQ is charted at seventy, which means he will stay boyishly naive until the script calls for him to suddenly make a profound declaration for the Oscar clip: 'I'm not a smart man... but I know what love is.' Whatchyou talking' bout, Forrest? This is retro-active re-writing of pop-culture disguised as American history designed to make us all feel better about not understanding the exact details of the Watergate break-in or the black panther party. Forrest floats through life with the gravity- and substance- of a feather, tossing off sickeningly-pointless nothingisms: 'Life is like a box of chocolates...' No, it isn't.It really, really isn't.His erstwhile girlfriend goes through every clich√© of cultural extremism (flower child, disco burnout, AIDS corpse) to lecture the audience about the dangers of Actually Being Involved In Something! We'll be much better off if we listen to Mama like Forrest and dip our toes in the water only for the sake of a digitally-enhanced photo-opportunity. (Love the way you moved Lennon's lips to set up your clunker of a joke... that took a lot of class!) And finally the mystery of who taught Elvis to dance has been solved- it was a crippled simpleton, and not the butler as previously suspected.But the adventures don't end there: Zemeckis (Greek for arrogant-ignorant) wants us to believe that this Drooling Dandy was an integral part of EVERY significant historical event: Gump meets JFK, carves Mount Rushmore, builds the sun, performs open-heart surgery! Forrest saves a fellow soldier during The War (good) who happens to be black (better) and inherits a shrimping boat (obviously)... we meet Gary Sinise's Lieutenant Dan who has the gall to question Gump's ability; for this his legs are blown off and he's doomed to an entire life of pain and suffering. Don't fear the retard...All of Forrest's toothless adventures are washed down with some of the most over-played soundtrack songs of the era, until the Dumb One takes to the road for a series of painful gags, increasing exponentially in stupidity until finally he's left with the motherless son he never wanted nor could possibly raise. (It's the next best thing to Immaculate Conception.) Are we vomiting yet?Ultimately, Forrest Gump proves that Tom Hanks was so good in 'Philadelphia' that we weren't finished giving him Oscars, and the movie's other trophies only go to prove that we're the very lemmings They think we are, preferring glossy bile over thought-provoking quality.This is 'Pop-Culture for Dummies' masquerading as American History and quality film.

Burn After Reading," Burn Before Watching
","The Coen Brothers' 'Burn After Reading' is a movie so thoughtless, so arrogant, and so poorly executed that it has forced me to re-consider my opinion of their previous films and seriously raised the question of whether they've been frauds all along.Joel & Ethan C. have always had an 'offbeat' sense of humor and an 'unusual' way of making movies, but fans like myself have always reasoned they were simply following their Muse and making the movies they had to make. With 'Burn After Reading' they present us with an espionage 'spoof' whose sense of humor is on par with that of the world's worst rejected sitcom pilot, and you have to wonder: Is this what they've truly been all along?Brad Pitt, George Clooney & Frances McDormand all star as Themselves; no attempt is made at building characters or adhering to any storyline reality. Brad dances because he likes to dance, George panics because it worked well in 'O Brother.' The 'plot' is ostensibly about amateurs entering the spy game with comedic results, but it breaks down so fast and so completely it's not even worth mentioning.No matter how many times McDormand blinks cute and begs us to remember Fargo's Marge there's no hiding the fact that the finished product here looks as if there was NO development done whatsoever. The movie feels like Joel & Ethan thought it would be a lark and filmed the whole deal in a week with a digital camera. The garbage that resulted is the death of cinema: Hollywood home videos with million dollar paychecks.I reserve the F grade for movies that are beyond bad¬Ö movies that have somehow crossed the line between respectable failure and offensive insult. If you like movies you'll avoid this one, and if you like the Coen Brothers you won't after witnessing the crime they commit here. Stay far away.GRADE: F",1,76,144,10 August 2009
Batman Begins," Punish The Child
","When we were boys we used to put the bath towel down the back of our shirt and make it a cape. We became Batman. Batman was a badass comic-book superhero who kept the streets of Gotham City safe. When you're a kid all you need is a towel and your imagination to have fun.Now that we're adults, we evidently have to rationalize and justify the fantasy. Laughter is not allowed, and cardboard and towels are no longer acceptable. To recreate the once-innocent fantasy of being a crime-fighter we now need leather, latex, and steel. We've graduated from toys to sexual torture devices. And there's no more buzzing about the room with a smile on our face- frowns are required. And sadly there can be no joy in catching the bad guy because now we're just as morally compromised as he is, and the loose-legend that once framed our hero is now dour gospel, a precise back-story so painfully-constructed and realistically re-enacted that we cannot possibly deny it's all real, and all really happening.Except it's not. This is a movie. A super-hero movie. And you can call me corny but I want to have fun when I go to a super-hero movie. It can be campy-fun, like the old Batman TV series, it can be dark-fun, like Jack Nicholson's Joker. It can even be corny, inspirational fun, like Richard Donner's Superman. But to watch a 'Batman' this serious just drains the life out of me. Are we being punished for our youthful exuberance and fond memories of playing after school? This film works so hard to prove Batman is real that they forget we don't want him to be real. He's a fantasy... he exists in our imaginations. You filmmakers do remember imagination, don't you?I'll get the towel.GRADE: C",5,3,6,19 October 2008
Revolutionary Road," Something's Missing
","'Revolutionary Road' features Leo DiCaprio (who I like) and Kate Winslet (who I love) as Frank and April Wheeler, a married couple suffocating in the face of 50's suburban life.Well, that's not exactly true... Frank seems only mildly frustrated by the limitations and obligations of being a husband, father and provider. It's April who is madly, fatally disgusted by domestic bliss, or even the implication. She's a poison pill who would ultimately rather die than settle for anything, at anytime.Many other reviewers here have noted the stifling life of 1950's suburban America. Enough. The fifties were no worse than any other decade- they just happened to feature post-war prosperity and a repressive, hypocritical facade, the result of the emergence of television, which provided the first mirrored reflection of our own decaying values. If the fifties were so bad why hasn't domestic bliss been successful in the decades since? Has the divorce rate risen or dropped in the past half-century? The Wheeler's problems were deeper than the calendar date...And therein lies the main problem with the movie. April is really the source of all the trouble here, and we never truly discover the root of her issues. She's introduced in the film as a slightly-emotional failed actress, but that doesn't explain her unending attempts at sabotaging everything she and Frank have achieved. Her pipe dream of moving to France is a double-edged sword: she's as disgusted when Frank agrees as she would be if he refused: there's no pleasing this woman.April is handled brilliantly by the great Kate Winslet, but something is clearly missing in the character: what could make a person fight this hard against every natural instinct, every chance at happiness? It is never revealed. Her affair with her next-door neighbor comes too late in the film to provide any insight... if she had been cheating all along at least it might be possible to understand her irrational desire to move to Paris immediately. As it is we're left wondering not what's wrong with married life, children, and American values but what is wrong with April... and in this way the movie slips the track and never gets back on course.The movie also loses points for the character of John Givings, played by Michael Shannon. He's the mentally-disturbed son of the Wheeler's real estate agent, and his nonsensical inclusion in not one but two significant scenes is undercut by his inexplicable fascination with the Wheeler's troubled marriage... It's like the Narrator stepping into the film to force a catharsis from our leads by confronting them with their own failings, and it stinks of Plot Device.On the whole this is a good movie, photographed brilliantly by Roger Deakins, who uses haunting day-for-night effects and captures the beauty of suburban dusk. If Sam Mendes had solved April's character by revealing- or even implying- her bigger issues this might have been a classic. As it is the movie parallels the very lifestyle that chokes its protagonists: something's missing, and it's impossible to ignore.GRADE: C+",Null,1,1,22 February 2011
Lawrence of Arabia," The Greatest Waste Of Your Time
","It's more than a little frustrating that 'Lawrence Of Arabia' is still considered a great motion picture... how long must we all pretend that this over-puffed, over-stuffed bag of sand is a good movie? It isn't- it's a terrible, slow-moving, monotonous, sleep-inducing, four-hour waste of time. There. I said it and I'm glad.There's no deep analysis necessary here... endless desert sequences are supposed to carry a story about war and Arabs and blah, blah, blah... Sometimes the classics are classics... 'Citizen Kane' is a great film, and if you don't know why, you should find out. 'Casablanca' and 'Gone With The Wind' are just as brilliantly entertaining today as the day they were released. Same for 'The Wizard Of Oz.' But 'Lawrence Of Arabia' is a long, dry, miserable waste of your time, pompous and bulletproof, a perfectly-crafted imitation of Cinema, an absolutely hollow and pointless experience, and a movie that should be avoided at all costs.You've been warned.GRADE: D-",1,30,84,15 September 2010
Amadeus," Classical For Dummies
","'Amadeus' is an insulting, juvenile, historically-inaccurate comedy sketch stretched to two and-a-half hours. It does not reveal the true character of Mozart or shed light on his musical brilliance- it does not even try. The movie plays like a practical joke, a humorous hypothetical on what might have been, but almost certainly wasn't.First, our story is told through the eyes of rival composer Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), who is little more than a narrator/stooge for the audience to laugh at while identifying with the rogue genius of Mozart. This is the movie's first stunt, and it only gets more manipulative from there. We are introduced to Mozart as a skirt-chasing, irreverent, giggling idiot, while of course the men in authority and powdered wigs stand around looking shocked at his behavior. Outrageous...This is a cheat that director Milos Forman has been using for years: the misunderstood, irresponsible genius who is always bucking the system and stirring up controversy, but whose actions are justified by his sex drive and/or having one woman that loves him. Adultery and a steady girlfriend do not make up for being a jackass, but Forman applied the same formula here as he did in 'Man On The Moon' and 'The People Vs. Larry Flynt.' It still doesn't work.Tom Hulce's portrayal of Mozart as a giggling manchild- to assure the audience he wasn't as dry or stodgy as we might imagine- backfires completely. He's so over-the-top ridiculous I wound up having less respect for Mozart AFTER the movie than I did before. Of course, the Mozart portrayed in the film has little or nothing to do with the actual man.Mozart was not- by any account- a childlike fool, nor did he write perfect manuscripts of music already composed in his head. Mozart and Salieri- who might have experienced a natural rivalry- were known to be good friends, and Salieri had no part in Mozart's death from natural causes. But then 'Amadeus' seems to lose some of its spark without a bad-guy antagonist whose only goal is the destruction of our hero.Finally, while I can't hold awards against a film, I cannot for the life of me understand why F. Murray Abraham- the film's lead actor- was nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category, and the fact that this film won both Best Picture and Best Director is a scandal. Don't waste your time on 'Amadeus.' Listen to some of Mozart's timeless music and you will know everything about the man there is to know.GRADE: D",Null,7,11,1 March 2011
The Game," Admit To Yourself That It Sounds Intriguing...
","What do you get for the man who has everything? On his 48th birthday, repressed financier Nicholas Van Orton gets a gift from his brother... it's a 'profound life experience' that 'provides whatever's lacking,' a 'vacation that comes to you,' a game... and so begins a suspense film so brilliant, so tricky, so beautifully conceived and executed that you will never forget it.'The Game' is a classic on par with Hitchcock's best... not since Alfred's 60's masterpieces has a movie so thoroughly- and enjoyably- messed with your mind. Michael Douglas is born to play the isolated Van Orton, Sean Penn pitch-perfect as his dangerous younger brother. The movie, directed by the divine David Fincher, is shot so beautifully it may make you cry. Witness the depth of the darkness, the weight of the frame, the gravity of the actors... this is the work of a master at the top of his game. If a great director is a great storyteller than Fincher can tell tales like no one else... he is in absolute control from frame one to the final credit roll.I won't give you the details of Nicholas' game... after all, figuring out the game is the point of the game. I will say that I'm glad I saw this in the theater on opening day but it's almost better on the small screen- letter-boxed of course. If you haven't seen 'The Game' I suggest you buy the DVD and watch it right away... trust me when I say you'll want to own it. If you love movies you will LOVE this precision-crafted puzzle, a movie that will not only keep you guessing but be just as (or more) entertaining on repeated viewings. Don't read online reviews that will blow the story or color your opinion... you need to experience this firsthand... you owe it to yourself.God bless David Fincher for messing with our minds, for creating a classic in the era of disposable film, for appreciating the intelligence of the audience while keeping three steps ahead.

Balance...The movie works as a straight-ahead comedy, as a legitimate creep-out, as a parody of itself, and as an unmistakably New York film. The wonderful special effects still look great and add a reality to the implausible proceedings. Murray, at the top of his game, sings every punchline and turns even straight lines funny:'You're never gonna regret this, Ray...' 'What about the Twinkie?' 'This chick is TOAST!'

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Why, David... Why?

I would have given you an Oscar for Se7en, Fight Club, The Game, Zodiac... your amazing movies have your beautiful, one-of-a-kind visuals and outrageous twists. Hell I would have given you an Oscar just for the Rolling Stones' trippy 'Love Is Strong' video. Everything you've done up to 'Button' was genius...But David Fincher's 'Curious Case of Benjamin Button' was a serious case of Academy-Fever, a disease for which there is no cure. Brad Pitt stars as an Old Baby who ages backward- a fantastic concept which only two characters in the film even notice. Brilliant CGI is used to transform Benjamin from dull elderly cripple to dull Kennedyesque hottie and- like screenwriter Eric Roth's other vapid creation Forrest Gump- Button does and says as little as possible in a heroic attempt to stay BLANK. (I don't want to give away the ending but he wins.) Besides boasting one of my favorite directors and favorite actors this movie also stars one of my favorite actresses- Cate Blanchett- who gets to dance with the body of a 19 year old. I've never seen a picture so visually rich with so little to say... what's the premise of 'Button?' That youth is wasted on the young? Benji gets the best of both worlds but still manages to avoid smiling. I barely made it through the movie's 2:46 run-time and I cannot think of a reason to ever sit through it again.Today's lesson: even Gods stumble.

Million Dollar Baby," No, It Doesn't Work
","*Spoilers Inside* (Please, don't read this review unless you've seen the film.) I saw Clint Eastwood's 'Million Dollar Baby' after hearing glowing reviews from critics and friends. I heard that it spun a story you thought you knew into new and unexpected territories. I heard it was magnificent. I was ready to love it.I left the theater feeling cheated, not only because of the jarring twist that renders all before it null and void, but also because of the genuinely shoddy direction, screen writing, and cinematography. Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) is a white-trash waitress with the dream of making it as a boxer... Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is the grizzled, crusty trainer who refuses to take her on as a client. Morgan Freeman is... Morgan Freeman, the noble, dignified black man that he plays in every film in which he's ever appeared. No surprises yet. After what feels like the longest first act in film history, Frankie finally agrees to come out of retirement and train Maggie. We are introduced to a harmless, semi-retarded boxer named 'Danger,' which was such heavy foreshadowing that I literally could not stop thinking about him for the rest of the film, positive he would prove to be the red herring that would kill, maim, or seriously injure one of our leads. The joke was on me- the character serves NO purpose in spite of his significant screen time. The idea that Maggie becomes an international superstar and contender for the championship and still does not know the meaning of the Gaelic nickname Clint has embroidered on her robe is absurd. And painful. When Maggie finally gets her title fight, an illegal punch by her monster-like opponent sends her to the mat, landing head-first on her corner stool- an event which in real life would disqualify her opponent and possibly concuss Maggie instead wins her opponent the fight and renders Maggie paralyzed, bedridden and ventilator-dependent for the rest of her miserable life. Are we having fun yet? This third act is where the movie falls entirely apart. Morgan Freeman's character is revealed as nothing more than a narrator, a prop, as he serves no point in character or story.Maggie's monstrously cruel family (ever notice how the antagonists in this 'brilliant character study' seem to be pure evil?) abandon her and only Frankie will stay by her side, taking care of the once-strong girl who can now barely speak. When she does speak, she predictably begs Frankie to kill her, to end her life and put her out of her pain and misery. Frankie finally decides to oblige after the mandatory wrestling with his conscience... he slips in one night as quietly as the angel of death and wishes Maggie goodbye, finally telling her the true meaning of the nickname he gave her. First, there is no chance in hell she would not already know, and secondly, by this point in the film it's so obvious that Frankie loves the girl like a daughter that the point is moot. The scene could have been saved by Maggie warmly saying, 'I know,' after Frankie tells her the meaning, but no... she's wide-eyed and surprised and moved beyond words. So Frankie offs the girl and slips away, never to be seen or heard from again. Wouldn't the nurses in the intensive care unit be alerted when a patient's vitals flat-line? Wouldn't there be a criminal investigation as to who killed this girl? A funeral, even? Not in Million Dollar Baby, baby. All we get is the god-like Freeman narrating the epilogue, pondering where Frankie is and what he might be doing. Problem is, I genuinely didn't care. What I did care about was the fact that the movie was filmed in GlaucomaVision... poorly-lit, out-of-focus, and often underexposed. (There's an art to shadows, Mr. Eastwood, and this isn't it) If you don't believe me about the visuals take a look at the scene in which Freeman and Eastwood watch Swank's first bout from the back of the arena... Morgan stands there with his arms crossed over his chest and there seems to be a key light on his little belly, drawing attention to his little bulge and making him look more heavy than he really is. There are a number of Steadicam shots in which the subject of the shot is lost, and boxing matches shot so shaky that people in the theater couldn't tell who was fighting. (At least it wasn't just me.) Million Dollar Baby is not only mis-titled, it's mis-made. The film exploits the boxing genre and a sack of sports-movie clich√©s in order to justify the idea of mercy killing. It is unsatisfying, incomplete, and poorly-produced. It manipulates the audience by using an absurd fictional story in order to prepare us for the 'shocking' ending... a better movie would have been less black and white and allowed us to decide for ourselves. The movie is nothing more than a calculated stunt, and Clint should have retired after 'Mystic River.' It's better to go out on top... just ask Maggie Fitzgerald.GRADE: F",1,54,99,9 February 2005
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Excellence
","'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' is a rich, suspenseful mystery that sucks you in from the opening seconds and does not let go for the next two and-a-half hours.The problem with most mystery films is that there's no mystery at all: clich√©d characters, uninspired acting, a paper-thin plot and a lack of genuine suspense. This film is the exact opposite.First, the acting. Noomi Rapace is brilliant as Lisbeth Salander, a brutish hacker with a violent past, and Michael Nyqvist is perfect as Mikael Blomkvist, a magazine reporter who's been framed by a dirty industrialist. Neither of the two leads ever hit a false note... they're not just characters, they're real people with elaborate back-stories and wonderfully complex personalities.The case of Harriet's disappearance is so challenging that the film never dwells on Lisbeth and Mikael's emotions; the satisfaction comes from watching them try to deal with their personal issues while they chip away at a mystery so deep it almost consumes them. Every time they solve a piece of the puzzle they find five more pieces, and the story behind the Vanger family tree is so layered- and twisted- that there's almost not enough time to cover it all in one movie.Every minute of the film is thrilling: it's directed with a focused urgency, an immediacy that keeps the tension high but never feels manipulative... the two and-a-half-hours feel more like forty-five breathless minutes. The result is a magnetic watchability- 'Godfather'-like- that is almost hypnotic, the stuff of great cinema.I'm very difficult to please when it comes to movies, but this was one of the most substantial, exciting films I've seen in years. Acting, story, suspense... 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' is a triple-crown winner, and an excellent movie not to be missed.GRADE: A",10,3,6,27 February 2011

Big Fish," Big Waste
","Big Fish is a film so startlingly awful that I wonder how it ever got made. Tim Burton, the one-time imaginative director of such films as 'Batman,' 'Beetlejuice,' and 'Edward Scissorhands,' has evidently lost whatever talent he once had. After this and his mind-numbing 'Planet of the Apes' remake, I strongly urge Mr. Burton to retire, or at least take a LONG vacation.Albert Finney stars as Edward Bloom, a dying man with a lifetime's worth of tall tales. Billy Crudup is his son attempting to separate the fact from the fiction. Unfortunately this involves long, pointless, confusing flashback/fable sequences starring Ewan McGregor (with the world's worst 'Southern' accent) as a young Ed Bloom. The result is a mess of a movie that is neither entertaining nor enlightening, not funny or dramatic, not even bold enough to leave you with a lasting impression.The direction is so derivative of other popular films/styles it is embarrassing to watch. There are changing-era soundtrack songs as we move through the years, including Buddy Holly's 'Everyday' (used first and more effectively in Rob Reiner's 'Stand By Me'), Elvis Presley's 'All Shook Up' (used in countless films including 'Honeymoon In Vegas') and the astoundingly trite 'Ramblin' Man' by the Allman Brothers, used too often to name. As the years go by and the jukebox plays one cannot help but be reminded of the similarities to Robert Zemeckis' 'Forrest Gump.' And of course there are the obligatory Matrix-styled special effects- used absolutely unnecessarily- in which time freezes (!)During attempted comedic sequences one gets the feeling that Burton has been influenced by the Coen Brother's 'O Brother, Where Art Thou.' Despite a handful of moments obviously intended to be funny I heard few laughs in the packed theater, and never laughed myself.Then there are the tall tales themselves... clich√©d, predictable and oddly flat. Meeting a giant and seeing a vision of your own death sound exciting on paper but these moments are rendered meaningless in the film. Wasted are such great actors as Jessica Lange, Danny DeVito, Helena Bonham Carter and Steve Buscemi.My advice to anyone reading this review is to avoid the film at all costs, because I can guarantee you will be disappointed. See another movie, rent a classic or even an old favorite... do anything but waste two hours on this cinematic dead-end. Big Fish is a dull, derivative, uninspired effort from a director who once had the ability to shock, excite and entertain me. Now he only puts me to sleep.GRADE: FEDIT: This movie was so depressing it drained the life out of me. Now, years later, it has come to light that the film may actually have contributed to the death of actor/monologuist Spalding Gray.

The Dark Knight," Kill The Actor
","I think its adorable that certain members of an unspecified generation find 'The Dark Knight' (aka Batman 2) to be a Masterpiece of Contemporary Cinema. Is 'adorable' the right word? Christian Bale reprises his role as the humorless comic-book hero and Heath Ledger joins the cast as the humorless comic-book villain ironically named 'Joker.' Ledger's 'Joker' is about as much fun as an emergency spleenectomy, which means to say he never laughs, never makes anyone laugh, and never jokes. Are we having fun yet? The film takes place in the same Gotham City from the previous film: flat, bleak, black, dark, foreboding, menacing, pessimistic, intense, sinister, colorless, numb, petrified... is this the fun part? Bale- an otherwise fascinating actor- manages to create a black hole as both Bruce Wayne AND Batman, leaving the audience without any protagonist for whom to cheer. Christopher Nolan's solemn direction is the same as in the first- he's working so hard to convince us that all of this is ABSOLUTELY REAL that there is no chance for any fun. Fun in a superhero movie? I must be out of my mind.What's sad is that poor Heath Ledger took the role of Actual Psychotic so seriously that it contributed to the man's death. No film role is worth your life, and if playing the villain in a comic book movie messes with your mind, you're doing it wrong. No offense to the late actor- whose performance here would have been great in a dramatic or psychological film- but Jack Nicholson nailed The Joker in '89. It was nice of the Academy to give Ledger the posthumous Oscar, but I think we all would have preferred he not die before his time.This is not to say the movie is terrible... it's still an above-average action flick with some nice moments: the sunset prison transfer is beautifully done and the scenes at Wayne's cocktail party border on subversive, but the generally dour approach to the popcorn-flick leaves me depressed, and I can't help returning to the thought that a man gave his life for this...Maybe that's what certain members of an unspecified generation want... maybe the Imagination is so damaged they don't believe a movie character is killed unless an actor really dies.

Total Recall," Aggressively Incoherent
","I couldn't spoil the plot of this movie if I wanted to... even though I've seen it 40 times since it's 1990 release I have yet to decide if the filmmakers had an actual, logical story in mind or just decided to numb the viewer with twists, effects and lots of things that go boom. The answer is, it doesn't matter.'Total Recall' stands as a definitive 90's action film... just enough substance to set up the fight scenes, explosions and laser-blasts. Every generation throws a mono-syllabic action hero to the top of the box office, and the 90's answer to John Wayne or Sylvester Stallone was unanimously-elected Arnold Schwarzenegger, who never met a bad guy or a sentence that he couldn't mangle. Arnie's accent and muscle-borne stiffness seemed to oddly liberate the creative minds in the directors and producers with whom he worked, from James Cameron's two 'Terminators' to John McTiernan's 'Predator.' He works the same magic in 'Total Recall,' a movie that resembles a PCP-induced hallucination: The Future... on Mars... multiple identities... paranoid delusions... It's like a big bag of buttery popcorn: delicious while it lasts, but no nutritional value.And popcorn's okay, from time to time, but I wouldn't want to live on it.

Iron Man," Century 21
","What did I love about Ironman? Was it Robert Downey, Jr.? Not really... he was good, not great. Was it all the CGI hardware and effect shots? They were fun, but that's not it. I think what I loved was the fact that the movie grabs you from frame one and pulls you instantly, effortlessly, into an aggressive, fat-free narrative with drive... the story moves at light speed, and by the time you realized you haven't touched your popcorn you're in the solid center of a great comic book/superhero movie. The film is also a blueprint for the way all modern movies should be made. Welcome to century 21...See, most superhero movies start with a first act that tastes like medicine. They're dour, solemn setups about nuclear accidents, childhood traumas and secret identities... it's redundant. We are now the sons and daughters of the MTV generation, in an omni-media world, and we know movies like the French know wine. Just put on the damn cape and start fighting crime! This is where Ironman makes even newer hits like 'Spiderman' and 'Batman Begins' look like creaky old dinosaurs; the first act is a self-contained mini-movie, as Tony Stark builds the suit not out of an idle need to do good, but to save his own life by escaping from his captors.By the time Tony Stark is back home the movie has brilliantly weaved in all the exposition and back-story we need to enjoy the fun. Directors Steven Spielberg & George Lucas spoke about collaborating on 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and they maintained it was impossible to make an action movie without a 'pointer scene,' a flat, boring, talky sequence which serves only to fill in the back-story and set up the rest of the film. They named this after the scene in 'Raiders' in which a government official literally puts a pointer to a chalkboard as he lectures Indy about the history of the Ark. Maybe it's a change of the guard, but there is no pointer scene in Ironman. You pick up as you go, and the payoff is a film that rewards you for being smart and paying attention.Director Jon Favreau has to take the credit for the film's greatness. He makes this movie for the audience as he would make a film for himself or his friends; no dumbing-down, no compromised corn or clich√©d studio stupidity. He is so committed to this story, so sure that this fantasy is real that he dares you to question it in scenes like the one in which Tony basically asks his secretary to perform open-heart surgery on him. You'll buy it. We're so deep into the brilliant fever dream that it all seems joyfully plausible. Bravo...Ironman should stand as a lesson to ALL filmmakers: stop underestimating your audience. It is the twenty-first century and we've seen everything. Twice. Stop trying to paint by the numbers and just paint. Ironman is a great leap in cinematic storytelling... I hope it's just a beginning.GRADE: A",9,3,6,23 October 2008
Donnie Darko," The Truth
","'Donnie Darko' blows. The movie is an audacious, pretentious disaster. It's an embarrassment to everyone involved and an embarrassment to everyone who sees it. Sure, there are still a few people left out there who saw the film as wide-eyed teenagers and still have the naivet√© (stupidity?) to call it a good movie but this crowd is maturing with every passing day. And as the good-hearted people wake up one-by-one the little cult that kept the buzz alive grows weaker, and fewer people are subjected to this film. There is a God.First-time director Richard Kelly gives new meaning to the phrase 'biting off more than you can chew' with a movie about teenage isolation, sleep-walking, imaginary friends, self-help, rebellion, death, psychology, martyrdom, love, death, and a pivotal sequence about an elementary school dance troupe which is NOT just another excuse to play one of his favorite songs from the 80's. Oh I almost forgot- Kelly also throws in sub-plots about time-travel and alternate universes just to keep things interesting. But you won't have to do a lot of thinking to grasp these deep concepts- he didn't.In fact Kelly doesn't seem to over-think anything at all. The movie cruises along until the baffling twist ending that simply negates everything that came before. None of it never happened. Now, we're hip to non-linear films, Dick- most people are these days. We understand stories told out of sequence, parallel narratives, mind-blowing twists... and we like them, when they're done right. But the end of Donnie Darko is what my parents would call a cop-out... just a cheap plot device to avoid making a statement or offering an idea. There's no resolution or explanation for what has come before, not an ounce of effort to provide a cohesive conclusion to what you've been watching. You will be sucked in by Donnie Darko... it's a watchable movie... and you will watch because there are interesting conflicts and because you're sure SOME if not ALL of them will be resolved... SUCKER!!!And that's exactly how the cult grew: intelligent moviegoers were so devastated by the film's aborted ending they reasoned there had to be more. (There isn't.) The audience insisted the story must make sense. (It doesn't.) They took to the internet, writing thesis papers and studying theories of alternate universes and time travel and eating up the director's retro-active re-writing of his script to fit the beliefs of his cult's current demographic. You could do all this work, too... or you could save yourself time...And just flush.GRADE: F",Null,2,4,19 September 2003
Born on the Fourth of July," No Time To Breathe
","To me, 'Born On The Fourth Of July' is the type of war movie that most people 'like.' Sadly, it's also the type of war movie that is instantly forgettable... there wasn't a single image, scene, or revelation substantial enough to leave an indelible mark on me. That said, the film is competent in every way, but pales in comparison to Oliver Stone's own Vietnam movie 'Platoon.' Made back when Tom Cruise was taking roles that seemed to parallel his own struggles in life (masculinity, religion, adulthood), the movie tells the true story of paralyzed Vietnam vet Ron Kovic who makes the journey from gung-ho, flag-waving Marine to embittered, paralyzed anti-war spokesman. It's a metaphor perhaps for America's own transition from self-righteous world guardian to humbled victim, yet the changes in Kovic never seem to go deeper than the surface; the movie's like a slightly darker version of 'Forrest Gump.' Okay, I'm being too harsh again- nothing's as bad as 'Forrest Gump'- but a movie that tackles this subject matter is almost obligated to take you to the darkest extremes of the nightmares of war and it's aftermaths... I never worried about the Ron Kovic character- not as a teen, not in 'nam, and certainly not after his return the States as the poster boy for the folly of combat. I never sensed real danger, possibly because he never got a chance to breathe.Maybe the blame here has to go to script: there are so many plot points to hit along a carefully-crafted storyline that you never get to indulge in a human moment in which the actors transcend the words on paper. Ron can't have a real scene with the great Willem Dafoe because he has to rush to a hooker, and before we can appreciate her night of sexual healing Ron has to be humiliated for wanting to see her again, and then he's off to the desert for a wheelchair battle with his mirror image. It's like a road trip where you drive so fast you never get to SEE anything.If the movie makes even one person question the wisdom of war and the lives it consumes then I'll have to consider it a success, but if you haven't seen 'Paths of Glory,' 'Full Metal Jacket,' or 'Platoon,' you need to go do that.Right now.GRADE: C",Null,0,1,18 July 2009
