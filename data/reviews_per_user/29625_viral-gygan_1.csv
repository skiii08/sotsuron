Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Spins & twists, a story that will pass you through all your emotions
","It doesn't really matter if you are a Sherlock fan or not. This movie is going to take you in a journey that won't show a predictable ending like Sherlock could predict. We learn the character's spirit and action, during the entire movie, as the mystery covers the whole story.With a sarcastic British humor, the movie blends with an enigmatic taste and action. The storyline is heavily not left behind by the visual effects, which at a top quality, is still surpassed by the greatness of the characters storyline. The whole movie tends to jump from the main order of a normal movie regarding the classical beginning - ending scenes. 'A Game Of Shadows' describes perfectly the entire world of this film, keeping you focused and excited the whole time.In my opinion, it's the kind of movie which makes you happy that you managed to see it. Because only few movies out of a huge list, makes you feel that way.With a story full of spins & twists, 'Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows', is definitely the kind of movie you can watch and pass through all emotions.",10,0,3,17 April 2012
