The Longest Yard," The Longest Yard scores with music television crowd
","The Longest Yard is a better than average movie that is likely to disappoint moviegoers that enjoyed the original in its box office run. Anybody would be able to enjoy this generally well put together story, but its MTV-style production is a miserable failure that is both obnoxious and over-the-top.In fact, this film's desire to appeal to the music television crowd is not only its worst aspect, but its embarrassing at times. Chris Rock, while funny in the supporting role as Caretaker, the friendly inmate that can things from the outside, is almost as racy on his HBO specials, and his racial comments are frequently unnecessary and inappropriate. In fact, The Longest Yard is filled from top to bottom with cultural stereotypes and builds on unnecessary racial barriers.And no football film could be complete without cheerleaders; unfortunately, the unit is comprised entirely of guys in outfits that can only be described as upsetting. While this may have been funny to see once or twice, there are no fewer than 5 shots of the spectacle, and the group is in way too many other scenes. There is so much more here that is simply wrong, and to put it simply, some stuff just is not funny and some people are going to be offended.If the possibility of being offended appeals to you, there is a pretty solid movie here. Adam Sandler stars in what is arguably his best film in years, and he is very believable in the role of a washed up quarterback. The supporting cast is also mostly superb, right up to bit roles like the one sportscaster Dan Patrick plays at the beginning of the film. Former NFL wide receiver Michael Irvin and rapper Nelly are also notable for their excellent performances.While there are a lot of good things to be said about the cast, the direction of the film strays at times. Some of the more serious scenes were corny (yes, corny) to the point where I wanted to laugh out loud, and on the total opposite end of the spectrum, many of the events that took play were completely irrational, totally ridiculous, or just flat out impossible.In the end, what you get is a typical Happy Madison movie with MTV's production. The results are some fantastic camera work, a ton of celebrities and athletes in the cast, and of course hip music. The Longest Yard is a success because it isn't a failure, but it falls short of being a really good movie.",6,4,8,31 May 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Special effects, action steal the show
","Star Wars fanatics obviously will embrace Episode III as another amazing film by the great George Lucas. While I enjoy a good light saber battle from time to time, I am as far from being a die-hard as there is. Frankly, Episode I was terrible, and Episode II did not stand on its own very well. Needless to say, I was not excited at all heading into the final piece of the saga.But Revenge of the Sith not only turns out to be a great Star Wars film (in fact, it's one of the best), it's also an awesome movie. Episode III is an enormous departure from the others; the action rarely stops, the acting is solid, and the film even takes the time to explore the different political agendas taking place. For the casual fan, there isn't going to be much missing.The most notable aspect of Revenge is the special effects. While the series has always been known for its fantastic visuals, these are clearly the best so far and are most likely the best in any movie to date. Everything looks vibrant and true, and no detail was spared in making everything appear as real as possible.In the end, the film's biggest flaws are because it is a Star Wars movie. The fight scenes, while they are all incredible, make up a bit too much of the movie. As usual, the script could be stronger. But the biggest problem with Episode III is that we've all seen Episode IV.Is it fair to judge a movie because we already know what's going to happen? Yes, in fact for casual fans it may be the single biggest problem. As I watched the end of the Episode III, I could not help feeling under whelmed by the whole thing, not because it was bad, but because I didn't see anything new. The birth of Darth Vader is interesting, yet Star Wars: Episode III Â– Return of the Sith is ultimately uninspired, just another Hollywood cash cow.Go for Star Wars, go for action, go to see these special effects on the big screen. Prepare to be impressed and amazed, but at the same time prepare to be a little disappointed.",7,1,2,19 May 2005
