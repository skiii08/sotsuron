The Mask," The Mask is funny and crazy
","The Mask is a good comedy movie, and was massive at box office for that particular time. The Mask was an enjoyable one for sure.The story is about a odd Bank Clerk called Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey), who lives in a rental apartment with his one and only dog. He has at times a troublesome life, but on one particular day at the Bank he works at, he meets this beautiful woman called Tina (Cameron Diaz), and has fallen for her ever since. So one night, he spots something unusual and goes closer to the city's harbour, but what he thought was there was in fact thankfully wrong. However, he instead finds this strange mask, and takes it back home. On that very same night, Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) puts the mask on without knowing the magical affects of it. It is this mask that not only brings fortunes to Stanley's life (Jim Carrey), but also trouble and more problems. But its up to Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) or 'The Mask' to solve the trouble and its problems.The Mask is a classic. The movie had everything: comedy, action, and even romance. The characters were well thought-out, and the cast did well with their roles. What makes the movie unique is that at times its all fun and games, but at other times, its in all seriousness, and you got yourself a funny movie filled with explicit action.It was probably this movie that made Jim Carrey a success he already is today. It is a movie worth watching if you're looking for some laughs and action.",Null,0,0,2 October 2014
The Avengers," A great team of superheroes
","This is the movie where all the superheroes finally gather together. This movie has all your favourite superheroes like Iron Man, Captain America, The Incredible Hulk and Thor. They form a team known as 'The Avengers'. In this movie, 'The Avengers' take on Loki who happens to be one of 'The Avengers' greatest enemies, and caused 'The Avengers' to assemble in the first place.",Null,1,1,5 January 2020
The Incredible Hulk," Where are the sequels?
","I think it was a good Incredible Hulk movie. I would see this again if I had the time since there aren't many good Incredible Hulk movies. The story was good and interesting. I liked the action scenes. But what I am truly disappointed about is that there hasn't been a sequel, and I don't understand why that is considering how popular 'The Incredible Hulk' is in the Marvel Universe. It's getting to the point where it's pretty embarrassing considering the ending we were given. When I saw the ending, I was actually excited and waiting for the 'sequel' to come, but that hasn't happened since, and probably never will. It's five years too late for my liking. I'm not happy since this movie looks wasteful. It looks like The Incredible Hulk had the easy ride or something compared to his other superhero counterparts. The Incredible Hulk is a superhero which many people or fans like. Someone such as Iron Man and Captain America had three movies; The Incredible Hulk has only one movie to show. The Incredible Hulk is just as popular as these other superheroes. There should've been three movies for The Incredible Hulk by now. Anyway, The Incredible Hulk is one of my favourite movies within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",Null,0,0,28 April 2018
Iron Man 3," Where is Iron Man's greatest enemy?
","The movie was still good and very entertaining for the most part, but I like many, was still disappointed that we didn't get to see the 'real' Mandarin, even after three movies within the franchise. He is after all, Iron Man's greatest enemy. Somehow, Iron Man 3 still was okay and worked for what is to come afterwards. I was hoping there would be an Iron Man 4 with the villain being the 'actual' Mandarin who is one of the most popular villains in Marvel. It could've still worked believe it or not given the story in the last movie. Iron Man 3 though it was good, could've been even better. I think Iron Man 3, somehow, was still better than the first movie Iron Man. Both were fine movies. Iron Man 2 was the weakest one of the three though it was still okay. It's a good trilogy. It's a trilogy Marvel fans can be proud about. If only another superhero, Incredible Hulk, had another few movies to its name. That would've been a good trilogy too, and possibly had rivalled it. Iron Man is one of the more popular superheroes around. All due to these movies. There's an animated series of Iron Man as well. Here, you get to see Iron Man's greatest enemy in action!",Null,0,1,12 April 2020
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," It's just as good as Space Jam
","I liked the story in this movie. The story is what made this movie great to see. It was interesting. It's great if you're into detective stuff. This is what this movie is about. Here, 'Roger Rabbit' is falsely accused of murder, and he needs the help of a detective called 'Eddie Valiant' to prove his innocence. Is Roger Rabbit innocent? You have to see the movie in order to find out. Who Framed Roger Rabbit was a fantastic movie. It was just as good as Space Jam. I liked them both. It's perfectly fine if someone thinks one is better than the other, but I think both the movies (Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Space Jam) were equally good. They're both different movies of course, but they're both that contains characters such as Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. I would say Space Jam is sort of like a sequel to Who Framed Roger Rabbit. They're both very similar. In this movie, you get to see many of your favourite characters: Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Donald Duck, Dumbo, Goofy, Jessica Rabbit, Minnie Mouse, Mickey Mouse, Pinocchio, Porky Pig, Roger Rabbit, Sylvester, Tweety Bird, Yosemite Sam etc. There are other characters too, but the ones I mentioned are some of the most 'popular' ones. I like them all. I liked the main antagonist of this movie - Judge Doom. He was scary; he was menacing. He was played by none other than Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future). He was excellent. I think it's his best movie. Let's not forget Dolores who is the partner of Eddie. A lot of people forget about her when it comes to this movie. So, if you're one of the many people that saw Space Jam first (like I did), and you liked it, then I would advise that you see Who Framed Roger Rabbit if you haven't already seen it. They were both fine movies, but if I had to choose between the two movies, then I would choose Who Framed Roger Rabbit for obvious reasons. It's in these movies where you get to see the 'Looney Tunes' in action!",Null,0,0,28 June 2020
Mulan," Chinese adaptation
","I actually got this film on video and saw it, and it was an interesting film or story shall we say. They made a sequel afterwards, but that wasn't required, and had the producers not done that, then the Mulan film would've held more weight, and that is why I don't rate Mulan as good as the Lion King, Aladdin and even Hercules. The characters introduced in this film were good - the best was that fiery red dragon named as Mushu! it was that dragon why this film was so successful. My favourite part was that battle or clash! The music was wonderful as well.",Null,1,1,21 July 2017
Kickboxer," One of Van Damme's most popular films
","Kickboxer is simply a cult classic! it is one of Van Damme's most popular films. Just really shocked that this film is now a quarter of a century old. I don't know why, but Kickboxer is one of these films that seems to bring back memories of your past - well, it certainly did for me because it was one of my favourite martial arts films.The story is basically about a young man called Kurt Sloane (Van Damme), who despite having no fighting experience or even interest, decides to learn martial arts under a trainer, so he can take on the dangerous and evil Tong Po and avenge his brother.Kickboxer is one of the films that basically kick started Van Damme's movie career. Van Damme was the real deal throughout the nineties, performing in so many successful martial arts and action movies.If you're a Van Damme fan, I'm sure Kickboxer is up there among your favourites. If you haven't seen the movie, it is worth watching.What I really liked about this film were the soundtracks - they were outstanding to listen to. The songs were beautiful, and fitted well with the movie.The movie is not too long either, so that's another good thing about Kickboxer.",Null,1,1,1 November 2014
Captain Marvel," It was boring
","I seen it, and I can't believe how 'boring' the movie actually was. The story was uninteresting. It could've been a lot better I think had there been other superheroes in Captain Marvel. I know there was Nick Fury, but I'm talking about 'actual' superheroes. I'm amazed how 'powerful' Captain Marvel is. She is very attractive. Her character was fine. I liked her attire. It's just the story which is boring. I can assure you that Captain Marvel will be a 'popular' superhero after seeing this movie regardless if it's good or poor. Captain Marvel is one of the newer characters. I'd be surprised if there is a sequel.",Null,1,3,24 April 2020
Iron Man 2," Two movies in a short space of time
","The Avengers still haven't come to the table yet. There have been so many different superhero movies since, but two of them early on have been the Iron Man movies instead of something else. Iron Man must be high in demand. I'm assuming it's just as popular as Wolverine or someone. You would have expected to be a movie of a different superhero, but it wasn't to be, and it didn't really matter anyway. The sequel is not as good as the original, but it is still a fine movie. It even has one of Iron Man's most popular foes just like the first. It's probably one of the more underrated movies within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A lot of people really like Iron Man. One of the most popular superheroes in all of Marvel comics.",Null,0,1,16 December 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," The best of the Caribbean movies
","It's an amazing movie - Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. I remember watching this movie a very long time ago, and I can't believe how much I enjoyed it. I was very impressed especially this movie in particular. It felt like some sort of classic! There have been in total five Pirates of the Caribbean movies, and they were all wonderful, but the one that holds true for many is probably the first one which nobody can forget about. It was this movie which started it all. What I really enjoyed about this movie was the start. The way the movie was introduced was breathtaking! It really got me interested, and of course, the rest of the movie. The story was wonderful and beautiful. I liked how serious the story was even though it was funny at times. Somehow, the humour just worked. There were many characters we were introduced with, and most people favourite was probably Jack Sparrow. I really liked Jack Sparrow. There's something special about him. You could tell when you see him in this movie how special he is - a wonderful pirate. Everyone supports him in his adventure. He made this movie succeed, and was so funny too. My favourite character, though, within the movie was Will Turner. I also liked Elizabeth Swann who happens to be a romantic interest for Will Turner. I always wanted these two to be together as soon as I saw them: it's a romantic relationship. A lot of people liked that. They were both attracted to one another. It was so sweet. It was hard for me to choose between Jack Sparrow and Will Turner - toss of the coin really. Will Turner reminds me of someone, and so does Elizabeth Swann. I also like the music. I think the soundtracks were wonderful to listen to. It's even nice listening to outside the movie. This was a great movie for the following movies - the sequels. Like I said, it's the story which I find interesting, but I think the first one, 'The Curse of the Black Pearl' has the best of stories. It's a classic! That's why I think Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is the best movie in the series.",Null,0,0,26 February 2020
Beauty and the Beast," It's a beauty of a movie
","This movie is also part of the Disney Renaissance along with the likes of Aladdin, Hercules and The Lion King. Beauty and the Beast is an interesting Disney movie with a good story. I wouldn't say it was as good as some of the movies mentioned above, but it was still a good Disney movie. I liked the characters introduced in this movie such as Belle, Gaston and the Beast. They were all wonderful characters. Gaston was a good villain particularly. He's tall, strong and powerful. He does not get as much attention as some of the other Disney villains such as Scar and Jafar among the Disney fans. Not that I care because I simply don't. I'm glad he's not as popular as the Disney villains mentioned above. These Disney villains (Scar and Jafar) are absolute legends. There are so many Disney villains, but the likes of Scar and Jafar happen to be iconic ones. A favourite for many. Gaston, however, sort of reminds me of Governor Ratcliffe from Pocahontas except only bigger. Both are driven by greed and power. I never wanted him to be with Belle, and I'm glad that wasn't the case. Beauty and the Beast is my least favourite Disney movie; Aladdin and Hercules are my most favourite Disney movies. That doesn't mean to say Beauty and the Beast was poor because it wasn't. It's just that everyone has their likes and dislikes and that's perfectly okay. I'm surprised how soon it was released: it was released in 1991. Only two movies that are part of the Disney Renaissance came before it - The Little Mermaid and The Rescuers Down Under. Both fantastic movies. I say that because there were so many Disney movies which came out during that time. Some of them I have already mentioned above. Some of the other Disney movies (Tarzan and Hercules) were released a lot later, so that's interesting. I say interesting because there was also a sequel to Beauty and the Beast released some time later. It's still a good movie - Beauty and the Beast.",Null,0,0,29 February 2020
Happy Gilmore," I didn't know golf and hockey could work so well together
","That's how you sum this movie up. It worked too. If you're into comedy, you'll really enjoy this because this movie gets you laughing, and that's why I like it. Adam Sandler starred in many fine films, but Happy Gilmore is one of his more underrated ones, and often, looks overlooked. I like, in this movie, how the character, Gilmore, uses a hockey stick to play golf, and it basically gets hilarious from there. He really has the talent to play his shots. The plot was good, and this movie will basically get you laughing.",Null,2,2,31 January 2019
Spider-Man 2," Spiderman 2 or Dark Knight
","Usually when it comes to sequels, its a failure compared to its predecessor but Spiderman 2 was certainly an exception and one of the best superhero films in world cinema today. The story is about Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) who is finding it hard to come to grips with his new profound abilities and his normal life. But he has even a bigger problem to worry about as a new villain known as Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina) causes havoc in New York City and its up to Spiderman - Peter Parker to save the city and the world from Octopus's destruction despite his current issues. The film was simply awesome!! and takes it to a whole new level. The performances of the cast was of top-notch. The only question Spiderman 2 leaves on my mind is whether its the greatest superhero film to date or is it the Dark Knight? because both were right up there amongst the greatest but that's a question for another day. Spiderman 2 was fun, entertaining and had a lot of romance and is a movie worth watching again and again.",Null,1,5,1 October 2014
Batman Returns," A bat, cat and penguin show
","During the nineties, this was my favourite Batman movie. Not only because the movie was very good, but also it included the Penguin, who is one of my favourite Batman villains, and obviously one of the most popular Batman villains in the Batman franchise.I know it's the sequel to Batman, but when I was a child, I thought it was the first of the Batman movies, but obviously I was wrong. Batman, we all know is a superhero, and this is a superhero movie, but you have to admit just how dark this movie actually was, and that's what makes Batman Returns unique (along with Batman) compared to any other Batman movie. Penguin and Catwoman were awesome as villains - the outfits for those characters was amazing. Danny DeVito was perfect as the Penguin, and did a splendid role at that too. Like I said earlier, the movie is dark, probably more dark than Batman, and if you're into dark superhero movies, then look no further than Batman Returns - really!On a side-note, if there was a third movie (with Tim Burton being the director of course) for sure, it would've been a great trilogy, and actually better than the Dark Knight trilogy. A third movie would've actually went well even if it may not have been good as Batman or Batman Returns. The villain I probably would've wanted to see there was the 'Riddler'.",Null,0,5,23 July 2017
The Mummy," The best of the Mummy films
","I've seen The Mummy several times, and it's a pretty good one. I actually use to own this movie on video, and watched it a few times. I even saw The Mummy on television, and it was even shown to us in school, and I seem to enjoy it every time. Actually, I always see this appearing quite often on television, so it must be really popular, and has a 'sizeable' cult following. It's a great adventure movie, and it almost feels like you're part of this wild adventure. The plot was good and interesting. Some of the scenes can be pretty frightening at times; in fact, it was so frightening that it literally gave me goosebumps. It's a good Mummy movie, and there aren't too many out there, so I would see this if you already hadn't done so. It's clearly the best of the Mummy movies. Even better than its sequels. We've seen many fine movies throughout the nineties, and I feel The Mummy is another one of these fine movies to be released just before the turn of this century.",Null,0,0,29 April 2018
Home Alone," From one big family to home alone
","What a fantastic movie Home Alone was. Home Alone is a really good Christmas and Family movie, and one of the favourites for many people.Many, like myself, watched it several times over the years, yet still can't get enough of it. This is a movie where Kevin is forgotten by his family, and is left all alone in his home.Little does he realise that there are a few bad guys that likes to call themselves (or at least one of them) as the 'Wet Bandits', wanting to burgle a lot of the homes within Kevin's neighbourhood, including his own.Kevin not only has to protect his home, but also himself, and prevent them from achieving their own goals, which is to burgle a lot of homes, especially Kevin's.What made this movie succeed is largely down to Kevin. I don't think any other child could've played it any better.My favourite part about Kevin is the pizza delivery scene, where Kevin says: 'A lovely 'Cheese Pizza' just for me'. That's one of many great lines found within this Home Alone movie.I know Kevin's house is huge, but I always wondered how many doors he exactly had from the outside into his house.Due to the success of Home Alone, many films have followed after, but only one of them can rightly claim to match it, and that is Home Alone 2: Lost in New York.",Null,0,2,18 December 2019
Spider-Man 3," Green Goblin, Sandman and Venom are the enemies
","Spiderman 3 as expected, was the worst movie of the trilogy. However, the movie, overall, was still okay, but Spiderman 3 had the potential to be just as good as the previous movies, but ultimately failed in the end.The story is basically about Peter Parker, who has for once, seem to have settled in a healthy relationship with his partner Mary-Jane, but their relationship, unsurprisingly, turns complicated, as more villains await for Spiderman: Sandman, New Green Goblin, and the dangerous Venom.Not only that, but Peter Parker's past has haunt him yet again, leading to massive problems for him in this final piece. Can he save New York City once again? The odds are heavily against him it seems.Spiderman 3 was not a total disappointment. It was still a fine movie. Spiderman 3 is a movie that will get you laughing that's for sure.But the villains, though good choices, were disappointing. Someone like Venom, who is one of Spiderman's most popular foes, was poor in this movie. Sandman, on the other hand, was boring and was left to be desired. Surprisingly, I felt that the New Green Goblin was the best of the three villains within this movie.But the main problem with this movie was that three villains is simply too much, and would've been better to have just one instead.Someone like Venom had a lack of story in this movie, which is a little disappointing because like I've said, he is one of Spiderman's most popular foes.",Null,1,2,14 August 2015
The Terminator," I like original more
","The sequel to The Terminator was brilliant, don't get me wrong, but I still think the original movie was slightly better. Both were great movies, yet different in their own ways. The Terminator felt like it had a more darker tone to it, and that's something I liked compared to the sequel. What I liked about The Terminator was the plot - very interesting to follow especially when Sarah first hears about her unborn son. Either way, I think this movie is a great set-up for what is to come afterwards. Arnold Schwarzenegger was great in this movie, and it's rare to see that he doesn't play the hero for a change; in fact, he was actually very scary as the 'Terminator'. I consider it one of his best movies out there.",Null,3,3,30 March 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spiderman has new enemies
","Another new 'Spiderman' movie, and it still doesn't disappoint which isn't a surprise. What I found interesting about this particular one was just how different it was compared to the previous ones. It has a new set of villains/enemies (Vulture and Shocker), and of course, a new Spiderman (Tom Holland).The main characters, Spiderman and Vulture, played by the actors were excellent choices, and I don't think anyone else could've done it any better. Michael Keaton and Tom Holland are excellent choices.What I enjoyed the most about this movie was the villain - Vulture! A 'new villain' compared to the other villains of previous movies, so I wasn't surprised that we've seen a new one yet again. That was a good thing. Can you imagine seeing the Green Goblin again? Despite being Spiderman's greatest foe. Only way it can work today if there are other villains along side with it, and I can only see that with the 'Sinister Six' or something, and that's something that may happen within this franchise later. I hope it does. I'm actually one of the few that won't mind seeing the Green Goblin again. He's Spiderman's greatest enemy!Vulture, though, is one of the most 'popular' as well as the 'coolest' Spiderman villains out there, and I'm finally glad he appeared in this movie. Also, he's one of the most underrated Spiderman villain. He has such an interesting back-story, and this movie depicts it very well. The Vulture was the reason this movie was a success. Those wings were mighty impressive and mighty cool! I liked them. That's one of the new enemies of Spiderman.Let's not forget another villain portrayed in this movie known as the Shocker!!! The only downside with the Shocker was that we didn't get to see enough of him in this movie, and he wasn't noticeable because he didn't have a costume of some sort, and that was a mistake I feel. In the anime, Shocker is shown wearing a 'yellow costume' that includes wearing a mask, and I wanted to see something like that shown in this movie just like in the anime. Shocker may not be the most popular of Spiderman foes, but he's certainly one of the more 'coolest' looking ones, but we didn't see it in this movie. This movie could've been a whole lot better than what it already was if the Shocker was given more attention. We may see Shocker again later in the series, and maybe he will have his own attire to wear. I hope he does. It will make the movie better.The title for this movie, Homecoming, is a good title. I liked how this series is trying to be different and attract attention. I think it's a good thing, and I think it will work heading into the future. I predict a great Spiderman series. This could be the start of something fresh. I like this reboot. Let's hope it works!",Null,0,0,11 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Completes an epic trilogy
","Many people say this was the worst of the three, but that makes little to no sense because they were all brilliant in their own right. Yes, Empire Strikes Back was probably a monster of a movie, but that doesn't mean i.e. Return of the Jedi was bad. It was still a very good film, but just not as good as the previous one, but really, that's just a matter of opinion. Personally, I enjoyed Return of the Jedi right till the end, and enjoyed the final third of the movie the most. Really enjoyed another battle between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. The conclusion was spot on, and it couldn't have gone any wrong. I think Return of the Jedi was almost as good as Empire Strikes Back, so I don't understand the negative reviews Return of the Jedi receives. The first one, though good, was the least favourite of mine, but I enjoyed all three of them regardless, and as my title suggests, it completes an epic trilogy!!!",Null,0,0,30 October 2018
Alien," I think the second was much better
","The movie, Alien, was a really good movie. This movie had so much suspense, so much, it was actually scary. The plot was fantastic. It's haunting too once they finally get on board because that's where the suspense really starts, and not just starts, but starts fast. It's an excellent sci-fi horror movie. That alien was scary; so scary, that it actually gives you goosebumps or something. I definitely had a few nightmares. The great thing about this movie is that it's an alien movie, and I was surprised just how good of a horror movie it was, especially when it came to aliens. However, I still think the sequel is way ahead, and has something which Alien lacked - action! I think the movie, Alien, is a great build-up for the sequel - Aliens. I don't know about anyone else, but I think the first two are the ones that counts within this Alien franchise, and pretend the other ones don't exist.",Null,0,2,7 March 2019
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," I liked how serious it was
","Captain America Winter Soldier was just an amazing film: great action packed thriller. It's undoubtedly one of the best films within the Marvel Universe, but the amazing thing about Winter Soldier is that even if it wasn't a superhero movie, it will still be a really amazing movie, and one of the best action-spy-thrillers of all time. The amazing thing about Captain America is that all its movies, besides the Winter Soldier, are amazing in their own right; the same cannot be said with all of the other superhero movies within the Marvel Universe. The story was very interesting, and though it's called the 'Winter Soldier', that character didn't really get much of a screen time for some reason unless I'm missing something. Unlike most of the other movies within the Marvel Universe, Winter Soldier is one of these movies you would see possibly again. It was entertaining for nearly the entire duration. And that's why many like this movie. The movie looked serious too, and it was important within the Marvel Universe, especially for what is to come later. It was an interesting movie.",Null,1,2,24 July 2017
Tangled," It's a story about a lost Princess
","It was a wonderful movie. The story is wonderful. Everything about this movie is wonderful. Tangled is about a young lady called Rapunzel, a princess, who is raised all alone in a tower by her mother or the 'bad guy' called Gothel. She spent all her life there, and wishes to go outside into the world for once, and see what it's like. I like all of the characters in this movie. Gothel, the princess's mother, was great as the villain. She was kind of scary even. I like the horse called Maximus. It's a special horse. It reminds me of the one in Hercules called Pegasus. I like them both. I also like Flynn Rider or 'Eugene' who happens to be a romantic interest for Rapunzel. The relationship was so sweet. I like the story too: it's romantic. I can't believe how long Rapunzel hair is. I like her hair by the way. I like the animation. I thought it was great. It's a Disney movie I truly like. It happens to be one of my favourites. Everyone should give this movie a chance. Tangled is something I could watch again. It's a 'special' Disney movie if you ask me.",Null,0,0,18 March 2020
Captain America: The First Avenger," The first of the Avengers
","This was actually a fine movie, and one of the most underrated ones within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Everything was fine from the very start. The story was very interesting. What made this movie stand-out was Captain America's greatest enemy - Red Skull! he was terrific as the villain, and made this movie very watchable. Red Skull looks very frightening, and we're not even sure what exactly happened to him later in the movie. He's one of the most recognizable foes in Marvel. Captain America was also brilliant. He's a true fighter or warrior shall we speak. I liked the ending though where he awakes from his slumber, and finds out where he's at. This movie is like a gateway into 'The First Avenger' movie the following year. It makes sense I guess.",Null,0,0,28 April 2018
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," The first part is better
","It's the final movie of Harry Potter except it comes in two parts. This movie is part one of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. It's one long movie, and that's a good thing because the story in both these movies is very interesting. To be honest, I think it hasn't been this interesting since Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. I'm not really a fan of the movies which followed afterwards until Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows came. I think this was the first movie to come in parts. It was a good thing considering it's the final Harry Potter movie, and we all know how long the books are, so there are a lot of things to cover. I think it was the first time any movie franchise has done that. Soon, others followed such as the Avengers (Infinity War and Endgame). Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows happens to be one of my favourite movies of the series, but I liked part one more than part two. In part one, not only the story is more interesting, but this is a movie which seems to build-up everything before the epic conclusion, and I liked that. In this movie (part one), you know still that there is a long way to go before the movie is finally over! In part two, it's more to do with the ending which everyone looks forward to the most. If you're a Harry Potter fan, you will like this movie.",Null,1,1,16 March 2020
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," They made this far too late
","Terminator 3 was a good movie, but a lot was left to be desired, and that's the impression I gotten. I didn't really like the parts towards the end, and feel kind of let-down because I enjoyed it for the most part. It could've been much better than what it already was, but at the same time, it could've quite easily been much worse. In the end, we were left with this. The movie is still very interesting to follow. The story is pretty good. But what I'm truly disappointed about is why it took such a long time to make Terminator 3 after the success of Judgement Day - that always baffled me. It looked like a third movie was doubtful or something. If Terminator 3 was going to be made, they should have made it within five years after Judgement Day. The title - Rise of the Machines - wasn't a bad title for the third movie. I don't know what else you could've came up with instead. Personally, after the success of the first two instalments, it would've been great had Terminator 3 not been made.",Null,1,1,26 October 2018
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," One of the best action sequels ever made
","This was the sequel to The Terminator. It was a solid sequel - a sequel that delivered. Some would go onto say this is one of the best sequels ever made - certainly, one of the best and greatest action sequels ever. There are some, such as myself, that still think the first one is better, but they are both fine movies anyway. What I enjoyed the most about Terminator 2: Judgement Day was how John Connor, and later, Sarah Connor, need to get away from the Cyborg that's out to get them. That was epic! They had help though in one of the cyborgs that's on their side in the escape. It wasn't easy getting away from the Cyborg that's out to get them, and it was kind of scary, but somehow, John and Sarah, along with the Cyborg on their side find a way. The movie gets more and more better, as well as interesting. The story in the movie is very interesting. It makes you want to know more about Skynet, what it is, and what it does, and why it must be destroyed. The standout performer in this movie was obviously Arnold Schwarzenegger, as this film is one of his best. I don't think anyone else could've played his role better other than him. He was brilliant in playing the Terminator, and it was good seeing him on the right side this time, and that worked to his favour. I liked the attire he was wearing. He was cool with that attire, and on that bike. That front cover or famous front cover says all we need to know. Terminator 2: Judgement Day was a brilliant movie. A good title, too, for the film.",Null,0,0,23 January 2020
Disturbia," A tense thriller that also has romance
","Disturbia is simply a brilliant mystery-thriller movie. The story is about a high school student known as Kale Brecht (Shia LaBeouf) who is sentenced under house arrest for punching his teacher in the face. So he gets bored at his house, especially when his mother Julie Brecht (Carrie-Ann Moss) cuts him off from using the television, playing his music and computer games. So to thrill himself, Kale (Shia) decides to spy what his close neighbours are doing and despite the early fun and pleasure he gains from it, it gradually get out of control and is leading him to not only trouble, but danger too. He also has new neighbours moving over, but there's simply more to this film then what just meets the EYE.Disturbia is a must see film especially for younger viewers. Not only its a mystery-thriller film, but also involves a lot of romance. The cast was brilliant in their roles and each did justice to their characters. I personally enjoyed this film very much as it kept me interested right from the moment the film started and is now one of my favourite thriller films to date. All characters have done justice to their roles. Disturbia rightly deserves an 8, as it was simply that good of a thriller to watch. Make sure you do if you already haven't.",Null,3,4,1 October 2014
Spider-Man," Not as good as Spiderman 2
","Spiderman was a good film, but nothing special as some are claiming it to be, but it's still a very good film, however.The story is basically about a high-school student called Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), who goes on a school trip. During the trip, Peter (Tobey Maguire) gets bitten by a genetically engineered spider and later, starts changing and gaining superhuman strength. His life changes dramatically since that day not just for the good, but also for the bad. Peter (Tobey Maguire), not only has to deal with his love-interest Mary-Jane (Kirsten Dunst) but also, confront and tackle the dangerous villain known as the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe).Like I've said, it was a good film but nothing great. The film has good action, it is funny, and at the same time, can be serious. The problems I had with this film is that the story could've been a lot better, it felt dull to me, especially the character Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe).Also the people that portrayed as 'high-school-students' looked way older. Willem Dafoe, who played Norman Osborne, was a poor choice. He didn't look right to be a Green Goblin, and taking on a young hero called Spiderman.Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are the ones that made this film good. They had the most parts to play.So, it was a good film, but not outstanding. The Green Goblin could've been portrayed a lot better I feel, and that's important because he is Spiderman's number one enemy.",Null,1,3,10 August 2015
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," There was no Voldemort
","I found this movie to be particularly interesting. It was the only movie in the series that didn't feature 'you know who', and that somehow worked. It was more than an interesting film.This was a movie that introduced us the Dementors, and they become prominent later-on. So, if you do see the films following the Prisoner of Azkaban, and you feel confused, maybe it's because you forgotten to see a particular film of the series (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban).This is a movie unlike the others that probably divides many people. Some say it's a great movie; others say it's the worst movie. I think it was okay.Why is that though? Good question - There are a lot of people that think the Prisoner of Azkaban is the best film of the series, mainly because of the plot, and that it's the third year, and that things are starting to move along at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but either way, the Prisoner of Azkaban is a unique film in its own right. It's unique because it's the only movie which didn't feature...Like the previous two movies, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is also a good film. Remember the Harry Potter books? The first three books were short. That's why I find Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban interesting, film and book.This movie, as you can tell from the title, and a wonderful title is about the 'Prisoner of Azkaban'. Who is the 'Prisoner of Azkaban'? Serius Black. Forget about 'You know who' for now. In this movie, it's about Serius Black, who becomes very important in Harry's adventures later in the movies.Serius Black is a very important character within the Harry Potter series, so in order to effectively enjoy the films from Prisoner of Azkaban and onwards, I would advise the Harry Potter fans to learn more about Serius Black, and why he's important to Harry Potter's journey, especially against 'you know who'. That way, you will enjoy Harry Potter even more, especially Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.If you can learn about Harry, Hermione, Ron and Hagrid and so on, characters we all like, then why can't you also learn about and like Serius Black? He's very important in their lives and adventures starting from the third movie.In the Harry Potter series, majority people think of the first two and final two of the Harry Potter films as their favourites, but why not the four films in the middle? with one of them being the Prisoner of Azkaban.",Null,0,0,18 December 2019
The Amazing Spider-Man," Had the potential to be the start of a great remake
","It was a good movie to watch. After watching The Amazing Spider-Man, I thought to myself: 'This could be the start of something great.' Sadly, it wasn't the case after what happened behind the scenes. The Amazing Spider-Man had all the ingredients to be one of the few successful remakes of any movie or franchise out there. I'd say that because, like I've already stated, the movie was a pretty good one. A new villain (Lizard) was good to see. One of the most popular spidey villains out there. Remember the Lizard well in the animated series shown on Fox Kids. The choice of cast was good too, so there was so much potential, but it just didn't live up to its mark since. But I really like the title: 'The Amazing Spider-Man.'",Null,0,0,28 April 2018
Die Hard 2," Die Harder in an airport
","It's actually a good sequel, but at the same time, it couldn't live up to the original film, and it's of no surprise because the original film is probably the greatest action movie of all time - most would agree. Still, Die Hard 2 is right up there among the best action films of the nineties (Die Hard was made in the eighties) and everyone knows that the nineties was the time where action films dominated the cinema screens mainly due to the success of Die Hard. What I enjoyed about Die Hard 2 is that it was set inside an airport, and the airport is large and full of people, so it makes it more interesting to follow. The villain wasn't that great, and it's probably one of the main reasons why this movie couldn't at least come close to the original. All in all, it's worth watching, but at the same time, you shouldn't expect it to be as good as Die Hard. It's a very good movie.",Null,1,1,20 July 2017
Avengers: Endgame," It's the second part
","This is part two of the Avengers. It's called 'Endgame'. I liked this movie just as I liked Infinity War (part one). Endgame was a very exciting movie. It's the conclusion after twenty-two movies in a span of a decade or so (eleven years). Here, the Avengers are up against it against the supervillain or 'Mad Titan' called Thanos. Can the Avengers do it? Can they defeat Thanos? This movie, Endgame, will finally reveal the answer(s). There was so much action to be found in this movie - it was endless! I can't believe how strong and powerful Thanos is. He's one of the greatest supervillains in the Avengers. More greater than the likes of Loki, Kang and Galactus. It's a long movie, but that's a good thing because the movie is entertaining. If you're not a superhero fan, prepare to be bored for these long hours. This movie is for superhero fans only! I was surprised, and a little disappointed with the ending, and how it all planned out. It could've been a lot better. It was sad to see the death of Iron Man or Tony Stark. I didn't want that to happen. That means there is no Iron Man 4 which many people were hoping. I always wanted to see Iron Man up against the 'real' Mandarin for a change, who happens to be Iron Man's greatest enemy. I can't believe that hasn't happened and ever won't. Avengers Endgame is a better movie than Infinity War I think. Both are fine superhero movies. Will there be another Avengers movie in the future? I hope so. There are plenty of other supervillains other than Thanos for 'Earth's Mightiest Heroes!' If there is another Avengers movie, I would like to see Kang the Conquerer or Galactus as the next supervillain. That would be cool!",Null,0,7,7 April 2020
Independence Day," This is a blockbuster of a movie
","This was a really entertaining movie to watch back then. It's one of my favourite movies of that time, and it was something I could watch again. I use to watch it all the time whenever it appeared on television, and it was cool to watch like that. The plot was fine though it could've been way better. The only thing I didn't like about Independence Day was that there wasn't enough of the aliens; in fact, I don't think there was much at all which is bizarre. All I could see was alien spaceships, and I think there is a difference. Also, there was barely much information on who those aliens were, where they were from, and how they knew about us. If only the movie gotten those things right, Independence Day would've been far greater than it already is. But I have to admit, those spaceships were so cool, big and scary-looking. It's these spaceships that make this movie enjoyable to watch. I really liked the scene where one of the spaceship just disintegrates an entire building in mere seconds with all these people on top. The cast was great too especially Will Smith. He was what made this movie a success. He's one of the main reasons I watched this movie, and why I particularly enjoyed it. The movie was fine all the way throughout, but I wouldn't say the part towards the end was as good as the beginning or middle. The parts at the beginning and middle looked serious, but the same can't be said towards the latter end. Despite its flaws, it's still a good movie, and I'm surprised it has a lower rating than what it should be. I think it should be higher than that.",Null,3,5,1 June 2018
Toy Story 4," This was about the lost toys
","This is a movie where Woody, and his friends go on yet another adventure - a different adventure. This time, they all go on a road trip with their new owner, Bonnie, and meet with someone they haven't seen in a very long time - Little Bo Peep. Toy Story 4 was a good and successful movie, but I wouldn't say it was as good as the previous three Toy Story movies. I think it was the worst one even though it was still good. Something had to give. They somehow reunite with Little Bo Peep despite all the odds. It's the story more than anything which I find interesting. It's not as good or interesting as the other Toy Story movies, but I still liked it anyway. I'm not happy Little Bo Bepp has returned though it looked good that she was back. I was glad to see the back of her in the other movies. She's not one of my favourite characters, but she returned again in Toy Story 4. This movie, I think, finally explains her disappearance. Woody, again, had a prominent role in this latest adventure, and needs to save the day. I'm assuming Woody is the main character. What I didn't like about this movie is that the other characters such as Buzz, Rex, Slinky...didn't have much of a role or screen time, and were quiet in the background strangely. These are toys we all like, and would've liked to see them in action just like Woody. I know Buzz does, but in this movie, he was pretty much quiet which I found interesting. I, just like a lot of people like Buzz; in fact, Buzz happens to be my favourite character. I wished Buzz had a more prominent role, so I was disappointed by that. Again, just like with the other movies, we were introduced with new toys, but the most interesting one was 'Forky' (nice name). In this movie, I think, it finally explains how toys come to life. Even though Buzz is my favourite character, in this movie, it was Forky who was my favourite character. I found Forky to be quite entertaining. Forky, is what made this movie interesting. Forky made me laugh when he wanted to go in the trash, but Woody wouldn't allow him to. I don't blame Forky for one moment. I could only imagine what Forky be like out in the stores today considering the way it is designed. How can people actually buy/purchase that? Toy Story 4 had its funny moments too. I like the new owner of the toys: Bonnie. I think she's a great replacement for Andy though I kind of miss Andy. The ending was interesting where Woody along with Little Bo Peep decided to say goodbye to everyone. This poses a lot of interesting questions about the future of Toy Story. Will there be a Toy Story 5? Will Woody Return? And so on. All in all, Toy Story 4 was an enjoyable movie. It's no surprise of course. Toy Story will always be about the toys or 'lost' toys especially.",Null,0,0,11 March 2020
Batman Begins," And it also ends well
","It was an exceptional Batman movie from start to finish. Great time for it to be released especially after the last movie of this character: Batman & Robin. That movie was awful. But this movie, Batman Begins, was the exact opposite of awful. It was brilliant. I enjoyed everything about this movie because it felt like a true Batman movie. The plot is very good, and gets very interesting as the movie progresses. It's the timing of the scenes that impressed me about Batman Begins more than anything else. The scenes were well shot, and everything was well-paced. It's a long movie by the way, but it's worth it.The villains introduced were great especially Ra's Al Ghul who is considered as one of Batman's greatest enemies. Scarecrow was also terrific, and had more of a prominent role in this movie compared to the other ones. Scarecrow was kind of scary. He goes unnoticed though for some reason. I just like how he puts on that mask. The villains are the reasons why I thoroughly enjoyed Batman Begins. They were great choices for Batman Begins compared to some of the other villains.The movie looked serious too. Batman Begins is something I could watch repeatedly: probably more than the Dark Knight. I reckon Batman Begins is pretty underrated. It's just as good as The Dark Knight. It performed poorly at Box Office. Although it performed poorly in theatres, it was still a very good movie. People are forgetting that Batman Begins is a prequel to The Dark Knight. A lot of people have forgotten about this fine movie.I liked the ending for this movie, and I think it's the greatest superhero ending ever. I liked how the Joker was introduced towards the end of Batman Begins with that calling-card. You have to see it! The things that were said during that moment was the start/introduction of The Dark Knight with that bank robbery scene.I also had the game of Batman Begins on Playstation Two - that was a great game to play.",Null,0,0,12 April 2018
Liar Liar," So funny it was hilarious
","This movie was so good from start to finish. It gets better and entertaining throughout the course of this movie. What makes this movie standout is just how funny it is. It gets you laughing for sure. I only watched this movie because it was starring Jim Carrey, who happens to be one of my favourite actors, and I'm glad I did because his movies doesn't really disappoint, and Liar Liar was no exception. In fact, you could argue that this one was one of his best comedy movies available. Jim Carrey literally stole the show or limelight. When you see it, it feels like he was the only one that made this movie to be such a success, and it's hard to argue against that. At times, it feels like Jim Carrey was the only one appearing in this movie, and everyone else was invisible in the background. This is one of these movies you shouldn't take seriously, and enjoy it for what it is, and that is to get you laughing.",Null,0,0,5 December 2018

Her design, the way she looked, was menacing. The only other one that comes close to her was Scar from The Lion King. Before the movie, there was actually an animated series of The Little Mermaid, so its recommended, though not necessary, to watch it before you see the movie. I say that because it all sort of builds-up to it, and you see many of the characters, including the villain, Ursula, in the series. The movie finally concludes everything. It was The Little Mermaid that first started this all, and it was a good one too.",Null,0,0,29 July 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," It's the first part
","This is the first part of the new Avengers movie. It's the first part of two. It's called the 'Infinity War', and a good title for the movie. In this movie, the team of Avengers have to take on a formidable supervillain called Thanos from taking over the universe and destroying everything. Thanos is one of the strongest and powerful supervillains in the universe, and the Avengers have their work cut-out even as a group/unit. In this movie, you get to see many of your superheroes such as Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Spider-Man and Captain America. They all have to take on this 'mad man' from Titan, and save the world. What I did like about 'The Mad Titan' (Thanos) was his costume. I thought that was cool. I like it when he wears that helmet - he looks better. Can't believe how strong Thanos is, and it takes that many superheroes to defeat him. That's why Thanos is known as a supervillain - a special kind of villain. It takes a team of Avengers to defeat such enemies. I thought the movie was good - I liked it. It's an adventure movie with a lot of action. It's also an Avengers movie, so I don't know how you can not like it. The movie was long, but that's a good thing since it's an Avengers movie, and it allows the story to develop, and this is what this movie does. The only thing I didn't like is that you don't get to see other superheroes in this movie such as the Fantastic 4 and X-Men. Where were they? Hope you get what I mean.

Aladdin," The original is still better
","I found this movie interesting. It was enjoyable - Aladdin. I liked it. It's pretty much the same as the original though I still noticed some differences. I wouldn't say it was as good as the original - no way! The original Aladdin or the animated version was superior.The ending in this Aladdin was different compared to the original. I actually didn't like the ending for this one. It was ordinary. It could've been better.The music was pretty much the same or similar as the cartoon version of Aladdin. I like the song/music Princess Jasmine was singing towards the end of Aladdin. I enjoyed listening to that. The song is called 'Speechless'. It's a great and wonderful song.The cast was brilliant. I liked Aladdin and Jasmine in this one. Both were excellent choices.The story was pretty much the same. Aladdin goes in that cave to search, find and retrieve that magic lamp. That was important because that magic lamp grants you three wishes. That was my favourite part of the movie though I prefer one in the original better. Nice to see the magic carpet too - I like the magic carpet in Aladdin.When it comes to the movie, the thing I was looking forward to was seeing the Genie. The Genie was played by Will Smith. He was excellent as the Genie; in fact, I was actually surprised by Will Smith's performance. He was one of the reasons why this movie, Aladdin, was enjoyable along with the people that played Aladdin and Jasmine. Like I said, the cast that were chosen was excellent. It was pretty much spot on. I liked Will Smith as the Genie. He was cool and funny. It was the Genie that made this movie a success. The Genie wishes to be 'free' you know, and that's what happened.The movie made over a billion at box office which was good to see and deservedly so. It's a record I think.The most interesting character of all, Jafar, was in this movie. Jafar, as the villain, was fine. The only thing I didn't like about Jafar was that he didn't look anything like the one in the animated version. I did like Jafar's Snake Staff. I always wanted to own one as a child.I actually have the calendar of this Aladdin movie at home. I have it displayed on the wall. It looks really good. That shows how much I enjoyed it.The most interesting of the lot was that Parrot - Iago. He looked and sounded nothing like the one in the animated version. I was disappointed by that. Iago is one of the reasons why Aladdin is enjoyable. In the animated version, Iago has a personality. In this one, he doesn't have one.Abu, however, Aladdin's pet was fine. Looked exactly the same as in the animated version. Let's not forget other characters such as Hakim and Razoul. They're important characters found within Aladdin. I liked them in the animated version better still.Basically, Aladdin was still a fine and good movie. I found it to be enjoyable, and it's something you can enjoy watching again, but I still think the original one was still the best. It would've been great had it been an exact copy of Aladdin. I think they made a mistake with some of the changes.However, I won't mind at all if there is a sequel to this Aladdin movie in the future. I think it will be a good sequel especially if it's about the return of Jafar. I really liked that movie or sequel. Happens to be one of my favourite Disney sequels.",Null,1,1,12 March 2020

","I'm surprised with the amount of negative reviews this movie has received on here. True, it wasn't a great movie, but it wasn't terrible either. I think it was somewhere around the middle, but it could've been a lot better for sure. What can you do? A lot of people would say it's an average movie at best, but I think it was slightly above average. I still enjoyed watching The Lion King. I say it's a successful remake because it's a successful movie. This movie, The Lion King, made well over a billion dollars at box office. That speaks volumes, and that's what counts in the end. Many people watched it repeatedly for sure. It's still not as good as the original, but the movie was still just about okay. What I didn't like in this movie was the villain called Scar. He looked nothing like the Scar in the animated version, and I was very disappointed with that. It was sort of hard to tell which lion was which. They should've made him look exactly like the one in the animated version, and that was possible. I liked the Scar of that one. Probably that's one of many reasons why this movie didn't go well with many people. I'm not really a fan of remakes. I don't see the point of it other than to make money. Now, I've seen this along with Aladdin, and I think they're both similar movies. I enjoyed Aladdin slightly more than The Lion King.

","This is a movie, or a sequel, that delivers. It was a very good movie - The Amazing Spider-Man 2. The story was very interesting. I like how the movie introduces the new villains, and they are a favourite for many, especially the Rhino. It was great to finally see Rhino appear though the only thing I don't like about Rhino is the way it looks. It would've been better had it looked like the one in the animated series. But we only saw a small glimpse of the Rhino which is fine for this movie. Another villain is the Electro, who happens to be the main villain in this movie. The story for Electro is amazing. Electro made this movie succeed. I also like the soundtrack of Electro - that was so cool! It was great to see two completely new villains (Electro and Rhino), and this is why I found the movie so good. It isn't boring - The Amazing Spider-Man 2. I was upset regarding the story of Gwen Stacey, and it really didn't have to be like that, and I feel the movie would've been more better had it been different regarding the story. It would've been better had Gwen still been around. There's another villain called the Green Goblin who happens to be Spiderman's biggest enemy. I liked how it appeared in this 'Amazing' Spider-Man story. Somehow, this movie worked, but the amazing thing is that it could've been more better. I really liked the beginning and final parts especially the ending. I liked the way this movie was going basically.

Back to the Future Part III was a good and successful movie, but I still think it was the weakest of the three. Personally, it was my least favourite for some strange reason, but I still liked it. I enjoyed the beginning and final parts the most. Everything else in between was fine, but I don't think it was anywhere near as good as the previous movies. There are a lot of opinions regarding this movie, and that's very interesting because the same can't be said of the other Back to the Future films; therefore, this movie does have its place somewhere along the ranks.

It was actually the years that followed where many people started to downplay this movie, and I don't understand why because it was a really great one. I don't understand how else you could've portrayed the Transformers in any other way to be honest. I couldn't find much wrong with it either. There are other Transformers movies which have followed, but this one is clearly the best one of the lot - at least that's what I think. As a fan of Transformers, I enjoyed this movie so much especially when you first see it. To be honest, before I first saw it, I wasn't expecting Transformers to be all that good, but I was wrong because it was. In fact, I was actually surprised. Transformers was serious as well as entertaining - you just know! I just liked the connection between the Autobots and Decepticons in the entire movie. If it wasn't, the movie would've failed to live up to expectations because of the intense rivalry between the two factions. It was a battle between the Autobots and Decepticons. This is what this movie throughout it's duration depicts. Megatron and Starscream were scary as well as menacing. It looked like they meant serious business, and that's what I enjoyed the most about Transformers. The movie gets you engaged right the way throughout. I'm a fan of Transformers, and enjoyed watching the animated series especially those involving the Beast Wars - I remember that very well appearing on television, and enjoyed every minute of it.

When it comes to the galaxy side of things, this movie was its only hope, but I think it failed at that. This movie didn't look serious at all - just silly jokes all the way throughout. The only good thing about the movie was the villain called Ronan, but he could've been portrayed so much better. He's one of the more underrated and underused villains within Marvel comics. Whatever glimpse we saw of Thanos in this movie, though it was good, it just wasn't enough I'm afraid. It would've been nice to see him at least a few more times just to spice the galaxy up. I don't understand how people can enjoy such movies, when they don't know much about such superheroes, factions or groups in the first place, and Guardians of the Galaxy is one of them. People just enjoy it for the sake of it, and I'm not buying with that.

I also liked the music or songs in Shrek 2 - it fitted well I thought. I liked the characters introduced in this movie such as the Donkey, Princess Fiona, Prince Charming etc. Another one of the characters in this movie, the Fairy Godmother, was a good villain in Shrek 2.

I just like how bad Ultron looks and appears in the Avengers though I still think he has been mismanaged, and that's one of the main reasons why I think the movie didn't go well with many people. Ultron is one of 'The Avengers' greatest enemies, so you would think this movie would've done more to make it appear that way. I feel like this movie should've had two-parts to it, or at least be a lot longer considering the villain it involved. Age of Ultron had all the things needed to be a great superhero movie. Perfect timing for it to be released as well. I remember first seeing the trailer as it first came out, and it looked really awesome. I liked how Ultron sounded: looked like he meant business.",Null,0,0,28 April 2018
The Dark Knight," I like Batman Begins more
","A lot of people are forgetting that this is the sequel to a previous movie called 'Batman Begins' which was released in 2005. The Dark Knight is an outstanding movie. It's one of the highest rated movies on IMDb (top ten), and one of the greatest superhero movies ever!Although The Dark Knight is a great superhero movie, and many people's favourite, some, such as myself, like Batman Begins more than The Dark Knight, and that's perfectly fine because Batman Begins was also a seriously good superhero movie.The Dark Knight had Batman's greatest enemy on show - The Joker. Batman Begins had Batman's second greatest enemy on show - Ra's Al Ghul. There's debate who exactly is Batman's greatest enemy, but the majority would say it's the Joker anyway.In both the movies, there was another villain called the Scarecrow. A lot of people are not aware of the fact that another villain existed in these Batman movies. The Scarecrow appeared in The Dark Knight Rises, but had a less prominent role as compared to Batman Begins. Scarecrow was terrific in Batman Begins, and had a more prominent role. Scarecrow was one of the reasons Batman Begins was so interesting to watch.The Dark Knight is an overrated movie; Batman Begins is an underrated movie. They are both similar movies, yet the stories are different for both. It's hard to choose which one is the best one, really. Most would probably go with The Dark Knight which is perfectly okay. That's why I think Batman Begins is more underrated. I actually think Batman Begins is the better movie. I seem to enjoy Batman Begins more than The Dark Knight. Batman Begins had a better ending than The Dark Knight; in fact, it was Batman Begins which introduced the Joker in the first place with that joker card (You have to see that ending.)The Joker was excellent in The Dark Knight, and made this movie interesting to watch. Some of the lines by the Joker was memorable. Let's not forget Harvey Dent, who later became what is known as 'Two-Face'. There's a lot of talk on the Joker, but a lot of people forgot about Two-Face, who is also another villain of Batman. Harvey Dent (Two-Face) was excellent in The Dark Knight.It's a long movie, but the most important thing is the story, which happens to be very interesting, so it won't bore you unless you hate Batman. Fans of the superhero (Batman) would like this movie.The start of the movie was breathtaking! It was an excellent 'calling-card' shall we say. I liked the introduction to this movie - the bank robbery scene. It was a fine way for the Joker to introduce himself in the world of Gotham.That's why The Dark Knight was an outstanding movie. It made more than a billion in box office. Interestingly, Batman Begins made way less than that, which is why I think people have forgotten that there is a prequel to The Dark Knight.This review is particularly for those that have yet to see Batman Begins. If you saw The Dark Knight and liked it, you will also like Batman Begins.",Null,1,1,8 March 2020
Toy Story," This is about Buzz
","It's a brilliant movie. I remember watching this as a child, and it was fantastic to watch, especially during the Christmas period. What I enjoyed the most about this film are the numerous characters it introduces - each having a part to play in this movie. The great thing about Toy Story is that we all have these characters we like and dislike; I'm a fan of Mr Potato Head and Rex, but I'm not a fan of Little Bo Peep and Hamm. But I still think they're all wonderful toys. When it comes to the main characters, I'm personally not a fan of Woody, but I'm a massive fan of Buzz; in fact, I only watch this film due to Buzz, and it's Buzz who plays the biggest part of this movie: Buzz is what makes this movie. This Toy Story is all about Buzz. What I don't understand is why Woody is Andy's best toy and Buzz isn't? It's a wonderful movie with a wonderful plot. The movie is also funny to watch. A good one for Christmas too.",Null,0,0,3 August 2017
Toy Story 2," This is about Woody

The story was even more interesting, and takes you into a whole new adventure. I really liked some of the new toys introduced into this movie such as the Emperor Zurg - really like the way it looks. My favourite one was the horse called Bullseye - he is so cute and adorable. I think it was these two new characters or toys which made Toy Story 2 a success. If Toy Story was mainly about Buzz, then Toy Story 2 mainly focuses on Woody. Personally, as much as I like Buzz, this is my favourite Toy Story movie, but they were all amazing in their own right.",Null,0,1,1 April 2018
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," The best of all home alone sequels
","This is my favourite Home Alone movie. I, like many, almost like everything about this movie. Why? In Home Alone 2, the stakes are higher. The clue is in the title - 'Lost in New York'.Kevin, the central character, is now in unfamiliar territory in one of the world's largest cities: New York.My favourite parts are those involving the 'Plaza Hotel' in New York City. Everything about that was brilliant or spectacular shall we say. I'm sure all of you would agree. I liked how Kevin just dupes everyone working within that hotel, and better yet, he's only a kid. That was so cool!What I find amazing is that his problems doesn't just stop there. It continues further, with the people he ran into before - 'The Sticky Bandits'. Somehow, Kevin just finds his way through unfamiliar territory.I like the setting of this movie. It was based on New York, and that is why a lot of people liked Home Alone 2 - the setting, makes all the difference. The story is good. It is set one year after the last one. There's no other way Home Alone 2 could've worked.It's important to remember the title: 'Lost in New York', and that's what it was. In the first movie, Kevin was all 'Home Alone'. We all knew that and saw that, but in the second movie, he's all alone again, except this time, in a city. That's why it's called 'Lost in New York', and before that 'Home Alone' because the cast from the first movie is the same and returned for this instalment. That's why it's Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. People forget to look at movie titles very closely and carefully, especially for 'Home Alone'.There's nothing to not understand except it's a brilliant film, and one of the best and finest Christmas sequels around.",Null,2,5,18 December 2019
Groundhog Day," This movie actually surprised me
","I wasn't expecting much before I actually saw this movie, but when I did, I was actually amazed and surprised just how good this movie actually was. It was literally: perfect. The plot of this movie was great. What I liked most about Groundhog Day was just how funny it was. This movie not only gets you laughing, but gets you laughing every time - it gets better and better. One of the best comedy movies from the nineties - certainly, one of my favourites. The cast was good, and I don't think anyone else could've played it any better. The setting for this movie was wonderful to say the least. I really like the title of this movie. Not only that, but it's also a movie you could watch all-day too, so it's not just a Groundhog Day, if you know what I mean. Gets more better the second and third time you watch it too. Very good movie to own on video. One of the finest comedy movies out there.",Null,7,8,11 January 2019
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," My favourite of the Harry Potter movies
","I liked all the Harry Potter movies, but the first one still remains my favourite. I remember always wanting to see this movie on screen as a child, and when I finally got the chance to see it, I enjoyed every moment of it from start to finish! Before I actually saw the movie, I remember one of my teachers reading the book to my entire class, and I just enjoyed listening into the story. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone just brings back the most memories out of all the Harry Potter movies.The great thing about this movie was how all of the characters were introduced, and that was important because the characters will further develop later into this movie, as well into the movies that followed.The story or plot was very good and interesting to follow. It was important that the first movie starts on a good note otherwise the following movies would just struggle, and this is what the Philosopher's Stone did.Whether this one is the best movie or not is debatable, but one thing for sure is that it does remain a favourite for many Harry Potter fans: it certainly is my favourite.",Null,0,1,6 April 2018
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," One of my favourite sequels
","I was very eagerly excited to see this after the success of Philosopher's Stones. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets didn't disappoint me one bit; in fact, it's almost as similar to the first one. The story about the 'Chamber of Secrets' was really interesting. The movie felt just as dark, or maybe even more darker than the first one, and that was a good thing I feel. It's the suspense that got me to like Chamber of Secrets. The characters were further developed, and that was important since the series would obviously continue with Prisoner of Azkaban. Before seeing the movie, I remember my teacher reading the book to our class, and I found the book to be really delightful! It's a great movie to watch along with the Philosopher's Stones especially during the Christmas period. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was a fine Harry Potter movie.",Null,0,0,6 April 2018
Die Hard," Best Action Movie Ever
","Die Hard is unarguably the greatest 'action' movie ever! Die Hard literally set the tone for action movies that followed: Under Siege, Sudden Death, Speed, Air Force One - you name it! If you're not a fan of action films, but have to see one, then my advise is to watch Die Hard because it contains almost everything you always wanted in a action movie - something other action movies are unable to provide.The story is about a New York cop called 'John McClane' (Bruce Willis), who is on his way to LA to meet his wife to patch some things up, but little does he know that there are a bad dozen or so criminals heading where he's heading (Nakatomi Plaza), and he has the toughest job in not only saving himself and taking on the bad guys, but also saving the hostages too, so the odds are heavily stacked against him.For me, the best thing about the movie was the villain himself: Hans Gruber. He's probably right up there among the greatest movie villains of all time. Hans Gruber is a psychopath.The movie has a great setting with a very good story, with plenty of action along with some 'lightful' humour. Somehow, it just worked.Die Hard is without doubt the greatest action movie of all time. Die Hard deserves a ten rating. You won't be disappointed that's for sure unless you hate action movies.This movie was made in the eighties, and not during the nineties guys, which automatically makes Die Hard a unique film in itself since most of the best action movies was made all throughout the nineties. Despite that, none can take on the original Die Hard classic.",Null,2,3,30 September 2014
Psycho," A classical horror movie
","This is one of the finest horror movies ever made. This is unlike most horror movies out there. Psycho had such an interesting story to tell. The movie had so much suspense. It was so interesting. Everything was literally perfect right from the very beginning. The timing of every scene was beyond perfect. You could tell just how perfectly well everything fell once the movie starts. Norman Bates is the highlight of this film. He's as psycho as you can get, and the amazing thing is that he looks all so innocent. That scene in the shower was pure gold. Whenever people hear, think of this film, I'm sure one of the very first things they can remember is that shower scene with the lady screaming. The other being Norman Bates of course, who is probably one of the greatest movie villains in all of world cinema. This movie is unpredictable, and that's why Psycho was such a great film. I was shocked with the ending. Never for one moment, something like this would happen, and in some ways, I was actually disappointed by it despite being really clever. In other words, mother was terrifying to say the least.",Null,1,1,27 February 2019
Hercules," The strongest hero in the Disney World
","This is one of the less talked about movies within the Disney world, and I don't understand why that is.I think this movie, Hercules, is just as good as some of the other movies that came before it, as well as after. Hercules is another underrated Disney gem or movie.This movie has one of the best-looking and strongest hero in Hercules. I don't know who else can compare to Hercules within the Disney world.Not only this movie has a great set of heroes, but equally, has a great set of villains, with the one leading the charge - Hades. He is one of the coolest villains around - really like those blue flames coming from the top of his head.Also, let's not forget about Hercules horse called Pegasus, who along with Hercules, happens to be my favourite characters of this movie. Both of them compliment each other well, and make a wonderful duo. I really like the way Pegasus looks - like the design.I would say there isn't much difference between Hercules, and some of the other Disney movies. They are all about the same level of quality I think. Hercules is a very fine and wonderful Disney movie.",Null,1,1,17 December 2019
To Kill a Mockingbird," I want to see this again

Unfortunately, I forgot quite a lot of it which is why I want to see this movie again, but I do remember enjoying it for sure. It's difficult to get a hold of the movie at the moment, but it's something I want to watch again. I do have it as one of my favourite movies still. A lot of people should see this wonderful movie. You'd be surprised just how wonderful and compelling the story is. I'm amazed the amount of reviews 'To Kill a Mockingbird' has got on here, so that's good to see. It's a popular movie. I definitely be adding this to my watchlist again, and hopefully, I'll be able to add to it on here. Just look at the title. A wonderful title it is. This is a movie for everyone.

Scream 2," It's scary than Scream
","I enjoyed Scream 2 right the way throughout just like Scream. Scream 2 has ties to Scream, so it's important to see the first one before the second one, otherwise it will be pointless. These movies have to be watched in order. I enjoyed watching Scream, but I enjoyed watching Scream 2 more. Why is that? It's because Scream 2 was much scarier. It was unpredictable. I think Scream 2 was almost as good, if not just as good as Scream, but both were kind of different when it came to style and tone. Scream was dark; Scream 2 was more darker. It was hard to separate the two. I don't think Scream and Scream 2 should be compared. It would be unfair. You can tell just how different Scream 2 is from Scream. You need to see it for yourselves in order to find out. Scream 2 was much scarier than Scream, and the kills were even more amazing, so amazing that it literally was scary. It got me scared. Scream was a great movie, but Scream 2 takes things much further. I can't believe how scary Scream 2 actually was. Scream was scary, but Scream 2 was even more scary. I don't know how that was possible, but somehow, it was. Unlike the first one, this one had so much suspense, and that's what I like about Scream 2. It keeps you at the edge of your seat. It's important to turn the volume-up in order to feel the suspense if you're watching this for the very first time. You won't regret it. It's one the scariest movies you'll ever see. It's one of the 'best horror sequels' I have ever seen. The plot or story was very good, and I really liked who Ghostface was in this one, and I don't know how else it could've been portrayed any better. The only downside is that it's fairly obvious who Ghostface was. I don't know about you, but it was kind of predictable for me. But I did like who the killer or killers were in Scream 2. Scream 2 was a good sequel. One of the best horror sequels there is.",Null,1,1,30 November 2018
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Takes you all the way back
","This was a fitting end to a trilogy. Die Hard with a Vengeance is a unique film just like its previous editions. Die Hard was based inside a tall building; Die Hard 2 was based inside an airport; and Die Hard 3 was based within an entire city (New York). The villain was great: his name is Simon Gruber, who is the brother of Hans Gruber, so this film has ties to the first one, so it makes it more interesting to follow. In the previous Die Hard movies, Bruce on his own was hard enough, but in Die Hard with a Vengeance, despite having Samuel Jackson along with him on this journey, they were still no match for the villain (or were they?). Though Die Hard with a Vengeance was a good movie, I still don't think it's better than its predecessors. If Die Hard was a great Christmas movie, or a great movie for the winter season, then Die Hard with a Vengeance was a great action movie for the summer season; in other words, a summer blockbuster!",Null,1,1,23 July 2017
Jaws," A thrill of a ride
","That's what happened as my title suggests. Jaws was a thriller. Jaws was a very good movie to watch. It's interesting from start to finish, and gets better and scarier.You couldn't do much wrong when it comes to the script, though I think there were a few areas of improvement, considering it's not just a horror movie, but a thriller too. It felt like everything fell into place at the right moment. I liked the pacing of the movie. It felt realistic too, and that's what made this movie memorable. I liked the casting of this movie too.It felt like this movie couldn't do much wrong. The great thing about Jaws was the time it first came out onto screens. I say that because it was the first movie to make more than a hundred million at box office, and soon, many movies followed after that. Who would've thought Jaws would've been that movie to break that figure? But it did.It's a cult classic! and remained a classic since. It never gets old. I know Jaws was a thriller movie, and is excellent when you first see it, but I enjoyed it the extra more when I watched it for the second and third time.The shark 'Jaws' was scary, even when you have yet to see it.

The Lion King," I wanted Scar to win
","This is one of the most popular Disney movies around - The Lion King. Everybody knows about this movie. This movie, The Lion King, has the 'most' popular Disney villain called Scar. It is Scar who reigns supreme when it comes to the ultimate Disney villain; in other words, Scar is the number one Disney villain. I really like the way Scar looks in this movie - his design is so likeable. There are dozens of other Disney villains, but I don't think anyone of them comes close to Scar. Just look at the things he has done in this movie. He's willing to take down his own family just so he can rule. Which other Disney villain comes close? That's how great The Lion King actually is. Scar is what makes this movie succeed. I don't know about you, but I actually wanted Scar to win, and be the new king. Maybe because Scar was fit enough to lead and rule, but that just proves how dark and menacing Scar actually was. Scar is the one that likes to be in power that's for sure. It's not one of my favourite Disney movies, but Scar is one of my favourite Disney villains. The Lion King was a very good Disney movie, and is a favourite for many.",Null,0,1,1 January 2020
Scream," Ghostface makes you scream alright
","Scream is what reshaped horror films in the nineties. I was a child back then, and whenever I hear about the movie 'Scream', and see Ghostface, it frightens me a lot. Scream was an excellent movie though I have to admit, it did look pretty obvious who the serial killer(s) were or was. I really liked the scene at the beginning. I think that was brilliant in regards to the character 'Casey'. It's that popcorn bit that strikes me for some reason. I also liked the scene right towards the end. There aren't too many horror films that has an excellent beginning and ending scene. The main character 'Sidney' was brilliant; in fact, she's brilliant in all the Scream movies. But what makes the Scream film standout is Ghostface. Not only the costume of Ghostface is amazing, but it's also very scary. When people think of horror films, I'm sure one of the first thing that comes to mind is Ghostface.",Null,0,0,16 November 2017
Back to the Future Part II," This is my favourite of the three
","I enjoyed the first one, and most will choose that one as their favourite, but Back to the Future II is, personally, my favourite of the movies within the series. Not only that, but I think the sequel is hugely underrated for some strange reason, so I don't understand what the original Back to the Future movie has over Back to the Future II. If you think about it, it should be the other way around considering that not only Back to the Future II takes you forward, into the future, but at the same time, or some time later, takes you back to the past; so in other words, still has ties to the original movie, so this movie, Back to the Future II has the best of both worlds unlike the first movie. Yes, Back to the Future was a classic, but Back to the Future II is also a classic if you ask me.But yes, what I enjoyed the most about Back to the Future II is that this movie takes you forward into the future, and it was really cool to see how the future was like and unfolded. I was astonished just how different the future in this movie was compared to the original timeline of 1985 - this is what makes this movie so memorable. Many of the things such as the hoverboards were really cool to see. Really like that jacket and trainers. Really cool to see all those flying cars too. I like how it nicely rains, and then stops afterwards at the beginning. That was timed ever so well. I liked everything once they get into the house, and the things that unfold there. Really liked the satellite they had with all those channels readily available. I think everything about this movie was spot on. The story was very good - it was interesting to say the least. You have to be very attentive to understand what exactly happens in this movie. The movie was excellent all the way throughout, but I particularly enjoyed the first half of the movie the most. The important thing about this movie is that this movie carries over from the first one, so it's vital you see the first movie, Back to the Future, before you see this sequel otherwise it's pointless.Back to the Future Part II is my favourite of the bunch, and is something I could watch repeatedly without getting bored once. I could watch this probably more than the first one, but I like them both regardless. It's great whenever it appears on television too. It's a timeless classic!",Null,1,1,4 February 2019

The Silence of the Lambs," It's a thriller
","I've seen way too many thriller movies, and The Silence of the Lambs was one of them. When it comes to movie genres, thriller movies happen to be my very favourite. This was a very good movie to watch. This movie was made on the year I was born, so it makes it that extra more special.I would say this movie, The Silence of the Lamb, was on the same level as movies such as Seven and Copycat, with Copycat being one of the more underrated ones. I know this is 'The Silence of the Lamb' review, but Copycat was a seriously good movie, and on par with these other movies. You'd be surprised just how similar and good it is. You should check Copycat out. It's a very good thriller movie along with Seven and The Silence of the Lambs. All three of these movies are great thriller movies.The Silence of the Lambs though was a masterpiece. It happens to be one of my favourite movies, and watched it a countless number of times along with some of the other ones.The start of the movie, where the FBI agent, Clarice Starling, was training outside at the academy was a great introduction. I have never seen a introduction like that before in any of the movies I have seen. The start of the movie was great, and from there, it didn't disappoint.In this movie, Clarice Starling, who is still a trainee, is tasked to finding, searching and capturing a serial killer or madman named 'Buffalo Bill', who happens to be a psychopath. She asks for assistance from one of the psychopaths located and imprisoned in an asylum called Dr Hannibal Lecter, a former psychiatrist, in capturing Buffalo Bill, who happens to skin his female victims. Clarice Starling has a challenging task in bringing and taking down this 'Buffalo Bill'.What I liked about Clarice Starling was her character. I have never seen a character quite like her before especially a female one. She's very keen on her job, and looks very determined in the task in hand, and ultimately bringing down Buffalo Bill.I liked all the training sequences Clarice Starling was undergoing at the academy. She sort of inspires you or someone to undertake a job or career like hers. It's a dream career - working for the FBI.Jack Crawford was also interesting, and I like how he leads the charge in this operation.This movie, The Silence of the Lambs, was a very interesting one. You have to be very attentive to what actually happens in this movie, and may need to watch it at least few times to get a true picture of what this movie is really about.What I found most interesting were the interactions between Dr Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling. It was hard to predict what was going to happen during those interactions. Sometimes, those interactions between the two was scary. It looks as if something was about to happen.If you are watching this movie for the first time, and reading this review, I would advise to try turning your volume-up on your television just for the suspense. It's a thriller movie after all, and that's what thriller movies are all about.That's how great 'The Silence of the Lambs' really is - it's a thriller!It's a different movie when you see this though the second and third time, respectively.It's the plot or story that's more interesting more than anything when you see this again more than the suspense itself. The suspense is already lost.The Silence of the Lamb is a great thriller movie for anyone especially if you're into crime. There aren't too many crime movies as good as The Silence of the Lambs.It's one of the best thriller movies from the nineties. Aside from the suspense itself, it's a movie you could watch repeatedly. That's why The Silence of the Lambs happens to be one of my favourite movies.",Null,0,0,31 March 2020
The Dark Knight Rises," It rises far too late
","This movie has so many 'question marks' which needs to be addressed. Yes, The Dark Knight Rises was a good movie to watch especially when you first see it, but it's definitely not as good as Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.This movie seems to have too many 'plot holes' which causes problems. Also, I don't like the 'eight year gap' after The Dark Knight story because it's too long for my liking: three, four or five years would've made far more sense.Story was good though, and it gets you very engaged, but it could've been so much better. It was entertaining.Obviously, the best thing about this movie was Bane - the villain was very strong and powerful. Bane was terrific as well as terrifying if that makes any sense. The only downside to Bane was the outfit, even though it was still okay. Bane could've or should've looked far more menacing than it already was. He definitely should've been a lot bigger in height. After all, Bane was the only villain that was known to have 'broken the bat'. I don't think this movie did quite a good job of it.Some of his quotes or lines were truly memorable: 'Why are you here?', 'Do you feel in charge?', and 'I was asking you'.I like Bane, but I don't think he was the right choice to play the villain in this final movie. Someone such as the Riddler or the Penguin would've been far better, but that's just my personal opinion. Personally, I would've preferred to see the Penguin instead - The story was there. But I can see why Bane was chosen, but the movie could've been far better than it already was had more care or attention was given to it.I don't know about you, but 'The Dark Knight Rises' looked pretty dull to me right from the very beginning, and that's something I just didn't like about this movie, even though it was still good. I'm talking about the colours and themes for this movie.The soundtracks for this movie was brilliant, and that was one of the best things about this movie.The first movie was 'Batman Begins'. The second movie was 'The Dark Knight'. The third movie should've been either 'Batman Ends' or 'The Dark Knight Ends' - this is what this movie does.Yes, 'The Dark Knight Rises', but it rises far too late. The eight year gap is just far too long. All three of these movies are good, but The Dark Knight Rises is the worst one of the three movies. Something had to give.This is the third movie, and makes up a trilogy. It's one of the greatest movie trilogies going around. Certainly, in the top ten.I still, however, think a fourth movie should've been made given how this movie unfolded. A lot of Batman fans wanted a fourth movie, and I think it not only would've worked, but it would've been exceptionally good. There are too many Batman villains out there for Batman to take on.",Null,1,1,6 May 2018
Iron Man," Iron Man upfront

I really enjoyed the first half of the movie. The villain was great despite not involving the Mandarin. I remember watching the animated series of Iron Man on Fox Kids, and I really enjoyed it. That series is pretty underrated, and it's a short one too unlike others. When I heard a movie will be released, I was pretty excited, and would have to watch it. Unlike many other superhero movies, Iron Man is one of these superhero movies you would see again. It's a good superhero movie to own on dvd.",Null,0,0,10 April 2018

The were some nice set of characters. I liked the villain called Yzma. My favourite character was the Emperor himself called Kuzco. He's a good-looking guy. He looks cool as the Emperor. I like the colours of the movie and animation - I thought it was great. You have to see it first. I think this is a movie for adults too. The jokes are hilarious. It's a fun movie for the family to see. It's something you could enjoy watching again. It never gets old.",Null,0,0,25 May 2020
Toy Story 3," This was about the Toys
","I'm a fan of Toy Story. I liked it from the moment I first saw it. When I first heard there will be a third movie (I wasn't surprised that there will be), I wasn't expecting it to be as good as the previous two, but I was totally wrong about that; in fact, many could argue to say that the third movie was the best, but I think Toy Story 2 was the best one. Maybe, you could have a vote to decide which one - it will be interesting to see the outcome of that.Toy Story 3 was very fun and entertaining to watch. You couldn't go much wrong with the plot, and I don't know what better of a script you could've come up with other than that. Also, the time it has taken to make a third one was astonishing, but it was worth it I guess otherwise the plot would not only have resulted differently, but also would've been a bad one too.The great thing about Toy Story 3 was just how much it sets itself apart from Toy Story 1 and 2. If Toy Story was mainly surrounding Buzz, and Toy Story 2 mainly surrounding Woody, then you could say that Toy Story 3 was surrounding all of the characters. I say that because the movie was about every one of them, and they don't know where they may be heading to next because Andy is going to college soon, and he's grown out of these 'toys'. That's why the plot was very good, and what makes Toy Story 3 an epic conclusion.I'm not entirely sure if a third one was in the works after Toy Story 2. If it wasn't, it would've made no sense considering the success and popularity of the Toy Story franchise.Toy Story was meant to be a 'trilogy', and not just a 'trilogy', but one of the great 'trilogies' out there today. This is what Toy Story 3 has done. Unlike most movie trilogies, where the third usually under performs, this can't be said with Toy Story, and is something the creators of Toy Story can be very proud.I know there will a fourth movie, and possibly more, but the original will always hold true no matter how good the fourth one or more is. Whether Toy Story 3 should've been the end of the story or not, only time will tell because it's very hard to say until we see the next one.",Null,1,1,26 September 2018
Space Jam," Looney Tunes are in action
","I liked Space Jam. I thought it was a fine movie. Here, the Looney Tunes are in action. It's a movie where you get to see many of your favourite characters: Barnyard Dawg, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Foghorn Leghorn, Lola Bunny, Marvin the Martian, Porky Pig, Sylvester, Tasmanian Devil, Tweety, Yosemite Sam etc. There were so many of them, and only this movie, Space Jam, is able to show you them. I liked them all (characters), but my favourite ones are Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. I think both of them make a good rivalry, but they have to work together as a team/unit, and take on a character called Swackhammer who forms his own team known as Monstars. The Looney Tunes call themselves as the 'Tune Squad'. The character, Swackhammer, was played by none other than Danny DeVito (to my surprise), and he was excellent in the movie. He even kind of looks like the character he played which I found very funny. I like the title for this movie, Space Jam, and think it's such a cool name. This is a good movie about Basketball; it's a movie which can get you to like the sport. Let's not forget the other sports shown in this movie - Baseball and Golf. Basketball is one of the most popular sports in the world, and has the greatest Basketball player ever in 'Space Jam' called Michael Jordan. He was great in this movie, and was the difference between the two teams. Can the 'Looney Tunes' do it? Can they win? Can they defeat them? You have to see it to find out. I remember how popular this movie was when it first came out. I use to own this on video, and use to watch it several times. I like the soundtracks in Space Jam. The most popular one was called 'I Believe I Can Fly'. Space Jam was a good movie. This is the movie where the 'Looney Tunes' or 'Tune Squad' are in action!",Null,0,0,10 June 2020
Speed," This is very quick
","The main story is about a LA swat officer known as Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) who is saving passengers from a Bus, and an enemy who demands a large sum of money in very little time. Its up to Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) to not only save the passengers on the Bus, but to also catch that culprit responsible for it.Speed was no doubt a true action movie. What makes the movie unique compared to any other action movie is that the plot takes place right from the morning. Nearly all the other action movies, especially during the nineties take place late afternoon and evening, so it's good to see a different action movie for a change.Its a good and interesting movie with a lot of action for everyone to enjoy, and I would recommend it for anyone that hasn't seen it already.The movie also has other well known popular casts like Sandra Bullock, who played the character Annie Corter, a fellow passenger, and Jeff Daniels from 101 Dalmatians, who played the character Harry Temple, a fellow swat team member and partner of Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves).",Null,1,3,1 October 2014
Cinderella," The story is wonderful
","This movie was very good. The story is wonderful. I remember first watching this at primary school, and I enjoyed it very much. It's a very interesting movie with interesting set of characters. There's nothing except praise for this movie. My favourite character is none other than Cinderella, herself. People are forgetting that this movie is very old, and that's why I'm really impressed with Cinderella more than anything. The movie is better than many of the recent ones, and when I say recent, I mean in the last twenty or thirty years. Yes, I'm talking about the Disney Renaissance. It's a Disney classic!

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," It's the final movie
","It's the final Harry Potter movie. It was a fantastic movie (part two). It was very entertaining. The story is very interesting. It's the conclusion, and I was looking forward to it. Will Lord Voldemort finally be defeated? This movie, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, has the answers. I'm not a fan of fantasy movies, but to certain movies, there's an exception, and Harry Potter is one of them, or one of the very few. The other one is 'The Chronicles of Narnia'. I like them both. This is the final movie of the series. It's the eighth movie in case you're wondering. It's been a long series. It comes in two parts. There's so much drama and action to be found in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. It's the final battle between Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort - a must watch!",Null,0,0,16 March 2020
Heat," This is about cops and robbers
","Heat is truly a masterpiece. Despite being nearly three hours long, it thrills you right from the beginning, and all the way through to the end.Heat is one of those films you are unlikely to see ever again, especially if the film involves two acting greats - Al Pacino and Robert De Niro.The story is about a tussle or war between the cops and robbers. The criminal or ring-leader Neil McCauley (De Niro) is leading a group of men to perform various heists. However, the time has come for him and his team to call it quits, but before that, they have plans to perform a massive heist for one-last-time! But, unfortunately for them, the Cops led by Lieutenant Hanna (Al Pacino), have been on their trail lately, so the criminal gang have their work cut-out, and need to watch out for their backs very closely.Heat was simply a brilliant movie. The action sequence, story, the setting of the film, directing, and the way it thrills you was simply immense. The soundtracks of this film was amazing. It's a must see film for those that have yet to watch it, especially if you're a crime-action fan.Surprised, someone like Al Pacino has not performed in many action movies - he just looks so classy for such roles in my eyes.Heat is without doubt, the greatest cops and robbers film of all time!10/10",Null,1,3,11 August 2015
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," It's still watchable
","This was the first movie of Star Wars. It's the first movie of three. It's definitely the least popular of the three movies, and that's perfectly okay because it was still a good movie - Star Wars. It's called 'A New Hope' the Star Wars movie. It was the first movie to be released, but the interesting thing is that it's 'Episode IV'. The prequels didn't come out till some time afterwards, so that was interesting. I never really understood why it didn't start with 'Episode I' in the first place. It's not my favourite Star Wars movie (A New Hope). My favourite Star Wars movie is actually the Return of the Jedi or Star Wars 'Episode VI'. Most people's favourite is The Empire Strikes Back or Star Wars 'Episode V' which is fine. I also liked The Empire Strikes Back. I wouldn't say the first Star Wars movie (A New Hope) is underrated. That title belongs to the Return of the Jedi or Star Wars 'Episode VI'. The first Star Wars movie was a great introduction. It's like a build-up for what is to come later, so it's important to see this movie before The Empire Strikes Back. These movies have to be watched in order. The first Star Wars is still watchable if that's what you want to know.",Null,0,0,7 March 2020
Tarzan," Tarzan of the Jungle
","It was interesting to say the least, but it is not something I would watch again compared to the Disney movies that came before and right after it. Personally, I'm not a fan of Tarzan, even though I had the video game on the original PlayStation. I played it, and thought the game was good. It was certainly a fun adventure. I wouldn't say the movie though was bad because it wasn't; in fact, it was fine. I like the story despite a few things. Many people like Tarzan, but I don't like Tarzan as compared to Aladdin and Hercules - two of Disney's most popular characters. When it comes to Disney movies, everyone has their likes and dislikes, and Tarzan is one of them. It seems like Tarzan is the least favourite for many people compared to the other Disney movies. Everyone talks about The Lion King and Aladdin, but very few people talk about Tarzan. I like Tarzan's friends or 'family', I thought they were interesting. Tarzan is a movie which can be emotional for some like myself.",Null,0,0,16 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," A space adventure
","Sometimes, I surprise myself on what I like and don't like, and Star Wars is most certainly one of them. I actually like Star Wars, to my surprise, and it is something I didn't want to like initially, but do, somehow. But just because I like Star Wars, doesn't mean I'm totally obsessed with it, even though I had a sticker magazine of Star Wars back in the past which I happily completed. That was something I was proud of regarding the book, as well as the films. The films though were very interesting. All of them were, including the prequels, which came after the original three movies. Actually, in fact, the magazine I collected and completed was on Star Wars Episode II, the second one of the prequels, but this is about Empires Strikes Back, which also happens to be the second one of the original series - what a coincidence. It must be out of this world or something. Most would agree Empire Strikes Back was a great movie, and I would happily agree with it also. That movie is amazing in its own right. The fight scene between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader was memorable, but luckily, it doesn't end here; rather, it continues into the next movie with The Return of the Jedi. Luke Skywalker happens to be my favourite Jedi as well as the best. The title is wonderful, Empire Strikes Back, and the fine thing is that it's the sequel which is labelled as the best film, and very few movie franchises can do that. It also makes up a very fine trilogy, and one of the best movie trilogies around. It's a space adventure...",Null,0,0,18 December 2019
Aladdin," Most popular of the Disney films
","There's just something about Aladdin. A lot of people like Aladdin compared to any other Disney movie. The movie was very good. This is a movie you can never forget.My favourite parts was all to do with Jafar. He was terrific in this movie. I also liked his sidekick in Iago. Let's not forget the most popular of all the characters called the Genie, who happens to grant you three wishes.What makes Aladdin succeed is down to its enemies. Aladdin has a lot of enemies, yet he's still difficult to take down no matter what.The movie is fine and wonderful. It gets more and more interesting for sure.I already made reviews on both the sequels of Aladdin, and I honestly think the sequels are better than the original movie. It's something Aladdin fans can be proud about.Everyone talks about these movie trilogies, but the one we often forget about is the Aladdin one, which is also very underrated. Each of the Aladdin movies, including the original one, are successful movies, and probably the best Disney movie trilogy going around. I can't really think of others that can compare to Aladdin.Aladdin is a fantastic movie, and one of the more popular Disney movies around even till now, and I'm talking about the original one.Unfortunately, the same can't be said for its sequels, and I would like for that to be changed though because I think it's just as good as Aladdin.",Null,1,1,16 December 2019
Pocahontas," A favourite for many
","I found it to be a strange yet interesting Disney movie. Somehow, it just worked. Personally, it's not one of my favourite Disney movies. I actually think a movie like the Rescuers Down Under is a better movie to watch than Pocahontas.But what I do like about Pocahontas is the villain - Governor Ratcliffe. This is a villain which actually frightens me compared to other Disney villains. Not just the way it looks, but the way it acts to. He's very intimidating, especially the things he does. For Governor Ratcliffe, it's all business, but he hates it when someone interferes. The great thing about Governor Ratcliffe is the way it appears compared to other Disney villains. He looks scary. Governor Ratcliffe is one of the more underrated villains within the Disney world.That's the only reason why I think Pocahontas succeeded, and also to the story itself. That's why I think that there is a small or large number of people that are massive fans of the movie. You could sort of understand that considering the title given for this movie, and the actual history surrounding it.Pocahontas doesn't end here. It continues further into its new adventure called 'Journey to the New World'.",Null,0,0,17 December 2019
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," A very good third movie
","This was a very good movie - a very enjoyable one. Transformers: Dark of the Moon was the third entrant of the Transformers series, and was a successful one. The battle still continues between the Autobots and Decepticons in this third movie. My favourite member each are Optimus Prime and Megatron - both being leaders of their respective groups/factions. I also like Starscream, and I always think he would make a good replacement for Megatron as leader. This movie was most certainly better than the last one (Revenge of the Fallen), and the most interesting thing about Transformers: Dark of the Moon was the story itself. I really liked the start of the movie particularly - it looked good and serious. The music was wonderful right the way throughout. It was still good to see Shia LaBeouf playing Sam Witwicky in this movie, and that was important because he was in the previous movies. This movie makes up what is known as a trilogy despite more movies which followed afterwards, and a good trilogy Transformers rightfully is. There was so much action to be found in this movie, and the action starts fairly soon. Though the action was good, it would've been better had it started later because the story for this movie was interesting to listen to. Overdoing the action is a bad thing, and this is what this movie has done even though it's a Transformers movie.",Null,2,2,7 February 2020
Back to the Future," A timeless adventure
","This one was spectacular to say the least. Back to the Future couldn't do anything wrong. Everything about it was perfect from the moment it started. The great thing about this movie is that with every scene or sequence, it keeps on getting better and better, so better that it's almost hard to resist. The story is excellent - very simple to understand and follow.In the movie, within the timeline, it's the year 1985, and Marty McFly travels 'Back to the Past' to the year 1955 in spectacular fashion, and has a whole set of problems to deal and tackle with. The odds are heavily stacked against him, and at the same time, he's in a race against time to get back to his future otherwise there will be a paradox. Only one person can save him from the mess he finds himself in called Doc Brown, a 'mad' or 'crazy' scientist.It's amazing how this movie actually unfolded. Everything fell in place ever so perfectly well - the film couldn't do much wrong. It's when they get back into the past where this movie truly excels. Everything was not just enjoyable to watch but perfect at the same time. I really liked how Marty McFly bumps into his parents, and takes on that menace called Biff. That menace, Biff, is someone nobody can forget about when they think of this movie. He was central to how everything unfolded within this movie. Let's not forget that cute dog called Einstein, who for some reason, happens to be my favourite character within the Back to the Future franchise. When people discuss about this movie, the majority will talk about Marty McFly and Doc Brown, but they seem to be forgetting that little dog, Einstein, that seem to have started this adventure in the very first place. The characters introduced in this movie, and possibly the entire series was excellent.The important thing about this movie is that it can't stand alone on its own after you've seen what happens towards the end, so it's important to see the sequel called Back to the Future Part II. The fine thing about Back to the Future is that you could watch this repeatedly, and yet, never get tired of it one bit. It's a timeless adventure! Not only it's a great movie, but one of the greatest movie trilogies there is.",Null,0,0,4 February 2019
Jurassic Park," It's a dangerous park for adventures
","This was such a fantastic movie back then and still is. It was one of the best movies out there during the nineties. This is something that can't be said of the other Jurassic Park movies. It was pretty adventurous, and the action was immense when the Dinosaurs started to unleash and wreck havoc. It was a good thriller if you ask me. Jurassic Park is very popular, but though it was a good movie, it's still very overrated if you ask me. I didn't see anything in this movie that suggests this is breathtaking. The setting of this movie was great. Like the theme park where the action and adventure takes place. The story, however, is nothing extraordinary - anyone could've come up with that. It was predictable. The story is nothing glamorous, and that's one of the reasons why I think Jurassic Park is overrated. Don't get me wrong, it's still a good movie, except overrated. There's a difference between a good and an overrated movie. A movie can both be good, yet overrated, and that's one of many out there. If there is one movie people can remember from the top of their heads during the nineties, I'm sure many would choose Jurassic Park. The name or title of this movie is great, however. I really like that logo. One of the best movie logos out there. It's very recognisable too.",Null,1,1,23 May 2018
The Simpsons Movie," Finally the first Simpsons movie
","So after seventeen years, the first Simpsons movie finally came out which I found pretty shocking, considering the success of the Simpsons television show.The Simpsons movie was an instant success according to me, despite many criticising the plot.The story is about how Springfield causes massive amount of pollution, and the pollution Springfield seem to cause keeps on getting worse and worse according to the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency). The EPA then goes to the US President, and provides the President options on what to do with Springfield. Initially, the EPA hands out a warning to Springfield, that any more polluting, then they will take drastic action, and that every waste must be disposed away in an appropriate and derogatory manner. Springfield took that warning well until one man, Homer Simpsons, disposes the waste into the lake due to lack of care, and him wanting free doughnuts, since a shop that sells doughnuts at Springfield is shutting down apparently. Problem is that no one is allowed to dump things in the lake again, and the EPA has evidence of Homer doing all this. Springfield is now in massive trouble all thanks to Homer, who along with his family must now save Springfield from the EPA, who plan to destroy the city.The Simpsons movie was a good and successful movie. One of the major problems was that the movie didn't involve much of the other Simpsons characters such as Apu, Flanders, Skinner and so on, and people wanted to see more of them, so its feels like a proper Simpsons movie.But the movie had plenty of humour, and will certainly keep the viewers entertained. The movie is short, sweet and simple, and most certainly lives up to its name.Its a good, fun animated-comedy movie for sure, and there's not much else to say really.The only surprising thing I found was that it's the only movie of the Simpsons, and you would've thought that with such a successful television show, there would be more Simpsons movies by today.",Null,0,0,12 October 2014
