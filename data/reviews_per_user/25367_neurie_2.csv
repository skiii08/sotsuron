Hereditary," Big disappointment that's well shot.
","First the good things: good cast, good cinematography, good effects.The bad: the story is weak making the performances seem bizarely edited together and makes very little sense with certain jumps in logic, takes too long to kick, the cheap jump scares just aren't scary, the sound mix(and sound just in general) is abismally bad causing any type of attempt at atmospheric tension building falter before the first hurdle.Probabaly the worst movie I've seen this year and marginally worse than Mother which was another pile of hot garbage.I cannot see how this has such a high rating.",3,1,4,1 July 2018
The Lion King," Visually stunning but shallow
",Aladdin which was a decent update of the animated version this is kind of soulless if you if your iver over age of 5.There are several good to great performances Jones and Oliver never miss a beatbox whilst other little like Glover feel miscast and BEyonce shows why she should stick to singing: whilst not bad persay there is no nuance or emotion in the vast majority of her scenes.Besides a few new jokes it's a shot Forbes shot remake and take an no chances.If you have the animated original watch that and save yourself fifty bucks,5,1,2,22 July 2019
