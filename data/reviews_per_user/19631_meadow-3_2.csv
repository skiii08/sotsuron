Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Why do moviegoers insist on comparing this to the others?
","Watching 'Episode One' with my sons, I fed off their awe and wonderment.  
Most PG films are not meant to be viewed through the eyes of an adult.   Nor reviewed by 'grownups'.  Remember when you first walked out of Episode IV?   I grew to like the film, but I wasn't especially thrilled by the shoot-'em up stuff.  However, I was far more impressed with Episode I. Of course, technological advances have made this a far superior product.'Episode One' (overly attacked by politically correct nabobs), HAS substance.   A child, watching this movie, walks away inspired by Anakin. Both Anakin and Qui-gon (Liam Neeson's character) are excellent role models. Heroic, silent, thoughtful, moved by moral choices.My kids, raised in a diverse environment, did not see the demons raised by the film critics.   They saw a Universe, populated by good and bad.  And they choose to follow the path of the Jedi.",10,0,1,25 March 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," This film is like an excellent, five-course meal.
","Considering hundreds of thousands have made this their top 4 all-time film, there isn't much that I can add -- that hasn't already been said (or known).Acting -- from lead to support:  superb.   What works the best is the obvious interaction between Robbins and Freeman, and the internal mechanisms taking place within themselves and the other.Screenplay -- Intelligent, eternal, interesting sub-plots, gripping, classic conflicts being resolved in a satisfying manner.  My only beef with the script is Freeman's final statement to the parole board.   I realize its irony, but didn't consider it credible.
Cinematography -- Every camera angle is well framed, positioned or filtered in choice moments.This film is an emotionally satisfying experience that leaves one feeling good about life and its possibilities.  What a wonderful ending.",10,0,0,8 January 2000
