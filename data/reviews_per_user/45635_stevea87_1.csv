Raiders of the Lost Ark," the quintessential action-adventure film
","The reason I find this movie so enjoyable is that Indiana Jones is an 'everymans' hero, someone whom if I were suddenly thrown into a similar Hollywood-esk situation, would probably do the same sort of things; be afraid, make mistakes, and sometimes not know what to do next. It is only through perseverance and occasional dumb luck which allows Indiana Jones to reach his goal.In so many countless action movies the hero steps into death-defying situations with the coolness of a cucumber, dodging every bullet with the deftness of a ballet dancer, swiftly decides every move with the foresight of a fortune teller, and finally come forth from the rubble with nary a snag on their three-piece suit. No, Indy is a hero with whom we find is frightened to enter a snake-filled altar, makes an error in judgement when he tries to destroy the most prized artifact in history (with a bazooka no less), and doesnt always know what to do next 'I dont know, Im making this up as I go along'.The excellent score by John Williams sets the mood of each scene so perfectly, I couldnt imagine replacing a single note. The now legendary main title theme is brilliant, and the haunting well of souls theme brings a dramatic chill. But its the music during the map room scene which is my favorite of this or any movie, the tension is brought out so well with the music no words are needed from either character.An adventure film classic, elements I felt were lost in the two sequels, (although I know many liked the third in the series), this has always remained my favorite ever since I first saw it in 1981. It fulfils the highest requirement for a movie: it entertains.",Null,0,0,3 December 2000
