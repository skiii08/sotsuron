Marie Antoinette," Two Hours Of My Life I'll Never Get Back
","While I love the story of Marie-Antoinette and have been very interested in the history of the French Revolution, I have found very little in the way of redeeming qualities for this movie. Generally I like Kirsten Dunst movies, and I am a fan of Jason Schwartzman but this movie just seemed to drag on and on. It was not a slow moving as the horrifically long and boring Lost In Translation but there were several segues that went on two or three times as long as was necessary. The movie also relies far too heavily on scenes with barely any dialog. Not that this movie should have been saturated with dialog but sometimes a little extra explanation goes a long way. I knew what was happening but it was annoying to watch it with a friend and have her asking why different things were happening because there was no on camera explanation of it. It also ends quite abruptly and does not close the story well. Of course everyone knows what happens but it would be nice at least have an epilogue. At least this movie taught me the lesson to never watch a Sofia Coppola movie again.",3,0,1,23 February 2007
