","Previous narrative treatments of the Iraq conflict have been created by people of the Vietnam era and inevitably suffer when they tell their tale most effectively through characters of that generation. While there are many similarities there are significant differences. For my money Pierce nailed in many ways how our current military is addicting people into a path of self-destruction. The slow revelation of lives unraveling as a result of mechanisms developed to survive immoral circumstance was most telling for me, surpassing previous powerful if flawed films. Kudos to Pierce, a masterful work. If they stay away, the problem is in us, not the film.",10,8,18,30 March 2008
