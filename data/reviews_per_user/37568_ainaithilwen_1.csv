Sucker Punch," Well, it sucked all right...
","I loved 300. I adored Watchmen. I really wanted to at least like Sucker Punch, but alas, that was not to be.First, I'm a woman, so seeing chicks prance around in thigh-highs fishnet stockings and slutty schoolgirl uniform (which I find rather creepy) doesn't do anything for me. Sorry, but after a while, my main thought was 'less boobs, more scenario/dialogue/anything please' Second: the music was gorgeous, but with the admittedly impressive CGI fights and overly pretty images, well, it felt like an outrageously long MTV music video. Note that I wouldn't make that complaint about 300, because the fights there were not as repetitive as in Sucker Punch. Because let's face it, the fights here are boring. It's like playing Tomb Raider 1: there is a set number of moves, and that's it.Also, the orcs at the medieval fortress... Ripping off Lord of the Rings make up style much? Don't get me wrong, Sucker Punch is bad-ass. Steam-powered zombie Nazis... life probably can't get much better.But a scenario might have been nice. Better (less awful) dialogues, too.Also, why on earth does the first level of the girl's fantasy world have to be a bordello? That's pretty gratuitous, at least in my opinion.Moreover: I went to see this expecting a bad-ass girl-power ass-kicking fest. That is not what I got. If I want girl-power, I'll go back to watching the awesome Ripley in Alien and Aliens, because those pretty girls all dolled up (in the sluttiest get-ups)? That's not girl power, that's the chick fantasizing herself as she should be to attract the male gaze. Because we're supposedly in the girl's imagination, right? And she's that innocent, virginal 20-year old, so how come her dream self and her friends look like they stepped out of a dirty magazine? (and why the bordello, dammit??) And anyone else feeling a burning desire to slap that doe-eyed, 'why me?', uncomprehending look off the protagonist's face, raise your hands, please.Anyway,I guess guys (at least some of them) might find that movie interesting as softcore porn/gaming footage. As far as I'm concerned, it was utter toss.",3,4,11,12 April 2011
