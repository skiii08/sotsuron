Iron Man 3," Disappointed
","***SPOILER ALERT*** For me this was the weakest of not only the Iron Man movies, but of all the recent Marvel tie-in movies. Also, let me say up front that I do not care about accuracy to the comic books, but I do care about consistency between the movies. I'll start with the good:<ul><li>The acting all around was good. </li></ul><ul><li>The CGI was excellent. </li></ul><ul><li>I liked the twist with the Mandarin and the possibilities with the media distorting reality. However, I can understand the whole Mardarin twist being a negative for many people as well, especially given the fact that magical-like power had already been established previously in Thor and the Avengers. </li></ul><ul><li>All of the references to the Avengers movie and the references to Iron-Man 1. </li></ul><ul><li>The realism of Tony dealing with PTS and working through his mental struggles. </li></ul><ul><li>The skydiving scene was very cool. </li></ul>The bad:<ul><li>Tony having the chest piece completely removed at the end of the movie. Whether or not you like Iron Man 2 or not, the fact is that it happened and much of the story in the movie revolved around Tony dying from Palladium poisoning, trying to find and alternative power source, all of Tony's reckless activities due to the idea of dying, discovering a new element to replace Palladium, etc. If he could just have a surgery and have the chest piece removed then most of that movie goes away. And, I had someone say that he was able to do it now because of the Extremis program. If that were true then that does not work either because he would not need a surgery at all if that were the case. Did all the Extremis people who got repeatedly shot need surgery to remove the bullets...no. So he shouldn't need a surgery either to remove shrapnel if Extremis was the answer, which the movie gives you no reason to think that was the case anyways. </li></ul><ul><li>Prior to this movie it was always made clear that the chest piece in Tony was powering his suit. They have completely ignored that fact in this movie. As a result for a lot of the movie his suit never reaches full charge and therefore is constantly in a weakened state, so he went backwards on his design. I understand that the new suit did need to have a certain level of internal power to allow it to fly to him and to allow it to suit him up, but beyond that is should have been powered by his chest piece as was established previously. I'm sure they did this to set up the ending for the removal of the chest piece, but come on. Again, another consistency issue. </li></ul><ul><li>As others have mentioned there is just not enough Iron Man. </li></ul><ul><li>All the controlling of the suit remotely. I actually liked the idea of him being able to control the suit with his thoughts, but they took it too far. There was already a lack of Iron Man in the movie, but on top of it most of the times when we did see Iron Man it was just the suit with Tony controlling remotely. This is ridiculous. A lot of the appeal of Iron Man is having the guy inside the suit. I really hope this does not become a trend for Iron Man going forward. </li></ul><ul><li>The craziness with Tony giving out his address on TV. Really? Because anyone and everyone who wanted to get his address couldn't find it out on their own without being told, especially terrorists who had the technology to block out the television airways and had the means to get into the President's cell phone. </li></ul><ul><li>Tony publicly announces that he is coming after the Mandarin to kill him after Happy is put in the hospital. Don't you think he would have gone home and made his suit battle ready as quickly as possible or change to a suit that was battle ready? </li></ul><ul><li>When they are being attacked by the helicopters at his house he had the suits that he could have called as he did at the end, but didn't...why? Oh yeah, because it would take away from the climax of the movie. </li></ul><ul><li>The little kid brought nothing to the movie and was totally unnecessary. </li></ul><ul><li>The Extremis group was taken too far with giving them super strength, breathing fire from their mouths, etc. </li></ul><ul><li>The Extremis research took years upon years to get sort of working, but still not perfect. Then Tony comes along when Pepper is the only one left and in the blink of an eye he can just fix her like it was nothing, effectively wiping out a major part of the movie like it never happened. </li></ul><ul><li>The climax with all the Iron Man suits seemed good at first, but it was taken too far over the top.</li></ul><ul><li>Too much humor. The previous movies with Iron Man (1,2, and Avengers) seemed to do the humor well with it coming across as natural. Iron Man 3 often times felt like forced humor for the sake of trying to get humor into a given situation.</li></ul>In any case, this is my opinion on the movie. I just expected more from Iron Man 3.",5,8,16,2 July 2013
Man of Steel," 'Perfectly Imperfect'
","*** SPOILER ALERT ***Everyone is going to have their own opinions, however after sifting through a number of reviews I have come to the conclusion that the majority (not all) of the negative reviews seem to come from people's preconceived ideas about who Superman should be, how he should behave, or even how the movie should feel in general. This is somewhat understandable since so much has been done on Superman previously and up until now every portrayal has been more or less the same old same old. Man of Steel is not simply a reboot, but also a re-imaging using some ideas and concepts from Superman that most people know, while making it darker and more realistic (given the source material). The general feel of the movie is more like Batman Begins rather than the Christopher Reeve Superman movies, so if you are looking for a movie with campy-humor and a light-hearted feel this movie is not it. All of this being said, this is my favorite Superman movie. It was everything I expected/was hoping for and in some cases even more. As enjoyable as the Richard Donner Superman's were, they were not very realistic (sorry people, deal). If you can accept the whole alien/super being premise then the rest I feel just works. Superman may have the genetics of a super being, but he was raised by humans, which means that from a behavioral standpoint he will be far from perfect, which is what this movie shows. He was raised by good people, so in general he is a good person, however he was also faced with considerable confusion, fear, ridicule, etc. growing up. All of this together would not result in the stereotypical poster child for perfection who stands for Truth, Justice, and the American way of life. What it results in is a normal well-intentioned person who happens to have extraordinary powers and many doubts. Someone who doesn't always make the best decisions, who makes mistakes, but is still trying to do the right thing and trying to understand the full implications of having such power and the responsibilities that come with it...and in extraordinary situations. And, don't believe the garbage that there is no thought to the movie, that it's all just CGI and action. There is that part of the movie, but if you are paying close attention to the dialogue there is also some thought that went into the movie. Just one of many examples is the fact that his biological parents had a natural birth so that he would have free will and be able to make his own choices, yet for most of the movie someone else is still making choices for him...in many cases his adoptive parents. It's not until closer to the end that he starts to make his own choices.Despite what people may have written, the flashback scenes of Clark as a child work and are not confusing in the least if you are actually paying attention.The battle scene at the end may have been a bit longer than it needed to be, but it works. If you have accepted the whole idea of super beings then the amount of destruction that occurs is very reasonable. It would be no different than if you or I were put in a city made of children's building blocks.I noticed that a number of people were outraged when Superman kills Zod at the end. Well, were they outraged when Superman killed Zod at the end of the Richard Donner Superman...probably not. And yes, regardless of any behind the scene looks or alternate endings the way the officially released movie ends it leaves the audience believing Zod is dead...end of story. And, in Man of Steel after Superman kills Zod he screams with regret. People seem to have this ridiculous thought in their heads that Superman should just magically be perfect from day 1. I hate to break it to people, but reality rarely works that way. Anyways, as I mentioned above, if you can go into the Man of Steel with an open mind and without clinging onto what you know and love about previous incarnations of Superman then there is a good chance you will enjoy the movie.Good luck and hopefully you enjoy Man of Steel.BTW...This is the first movie I have ever watched where most of the audience clapped at the end.",9,2,6,26 June 2013
