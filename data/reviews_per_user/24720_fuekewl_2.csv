Skyfall," Can the real Bond please stand up?
","I am suspicious that all these positive reviews and initial high IMDb rating are studio backed endorsements of the movie.This Bond was THE worst ever in the series. Take my word for it, go see it for yourself.What started great, 'falls' into a preposterous, illogical, survival horror mess; peppered with the worst movie copycatting: Dark Knight (a Spanish Joker + Two Face hybrid literally and figuratively), The Terminator and Home Alone rolled into a Uwe Boll-esque take on the franchise.Super old-skinned-face and craggy Daniel Craig, needs to instruct his agent to delete the clause of 'remove your top in 2 or more scenes' because, seriously, we get it! We get that you are the anti-pretty-boy-hero, but stop showing your pecks in every single movie you have starred in, simply to distract the audience from your mangled face.No emotional investment in M from the start, means no emotional investment at the end. For sure, the entire audience were secretly wishing she kill herself already, and spare the body count of decent hardworking Londoners. This is not the Bond you are expecting, instead it was an extended cut of Bond's London Olympics Opening Ceremony cameo. A serious, unfunny, comedy-fest.3/10.",1,39,80,26 October 2012
V for Vendetta," Modern-day classic. Best movie since Fight Club.
","I watched this movie last night, afterward realizing that it may have been the single best movie I had seen the entire year. The balance of narrative, cinematography, score and acting provide an enjoyable path of escapism for your discerning moviegoer.At the same time, it offers a great amount of introspection on how we are influenced by the mainstream media and its hidden political agendas. It is an extrapolation of how democracy becomes totalitarian, where unquestioned fear keeps the populous sedated and where repression of truth keeps the corrupt in power. It is an allegory that serves as a cautionary yardstick which we must measure our own world governments by.The ensemble of a talented cast, each playing a flawed three-dimensional character with enough nuance, enhanced the believability of the tale.Natalie Portman portrayed Evey Hammond with aplomb. I likened her to a naive caterpillar initially weakened by the fear of non-conformance. Meeting V, whose daunting, methodical obsession for retribution and revolution becomes the catalyst that transforms Evey into a fearless butterfly, unchained from the yoke of fraudulent terror and guarded oppression.Hugh Weaving's portrayal of the intelligent, calculating, almost-deranged, brutally-detached, self-sacrificing, mutated superhuman character of V was superb. Not for one moment did the Guy Fawkes's mask hinder Hugh's ability to convey the expressions and emotions of the character. With elegant delivery of poetic, thought-provoking monologues, I could think of no better actor.The adaptation from graphic novel to movie was as good as it gets, given the current political climate we face ourselves in. Director James McTeigue presents a movie that does not employ over-the-top bullet-time fight sequences without justification. When it is employed, it is in such a benign fashion that it compliments the expectation of the audience. All elements combine to make this movie a modern-day classic, that will not simply be dated by its the hair-styles, make-up and clothes worn.Why its creator, Alan Moore, distanced himself from the movie is an enigma. Maybe true to form and true to his revolutionary protagonist, V, he's action serves to offer credibility to the significance of his work, remaining the neutral, non-conformist opposing the politicized mainstream media conglomerates.Nevertheless, it remains a movie that does not detract from its original overarching message of hope beyond the real fear and freedom beyond the unseen tyranny.If you are still unconvinced, go see it just for the mere fact that this movie, charged with so many political overtones, has actually been made.10/10 for sure!",10,3,7,30 March 2006
