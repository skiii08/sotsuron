Requiem for a Dream," Perfect Film
","Pi was great, but Requiem is better. Besides the rough subject manner, I find the second directorial project of Darren Aronofsky to be incredible. Everyaspect of the film is great. The story is beautifully adapted from the Hubert Shelby book. Shelby even has a cameo as a prison guard at the end of themovie. I personally think that Matthew Libatique is one of the hottestcinematographers around. I liked the shooting so much that I went and saw all his other movies. The editing by Jay Rabinowirz is crisp. The haunting score by Clint Mansell is sad and creepy, which really makes the movie that muchbetter. I cannot say more about it. Simply a top three movie in my book, and I haveseen hundreds of movies. Any movie that sticks to your inner soul and affects your thoughts from day to day is special. This movie redirected my personalartistic ambitions away from graphic arts and towards cinema. This IS a very special movie that will affect the way you view your everyday life.",10,0,1,23 August 2004
Halloween," Scary As Hell
",This movie terrifies me to this day. This is really the only slasher film that rattles my bones. The use of movement behind characters by Michale Myers is paramount. Great classic that should be seen by anyone wishing to see a good slasher film. After you watch this film you will find yourself looking over your shoulder to see if anything is behind you.Halloween is a much scarier series than Friday the Thirteenth or Nightmare on Elm Street.,8,0,1,23 August 2004
