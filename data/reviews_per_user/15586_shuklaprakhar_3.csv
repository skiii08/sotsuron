Airlift," A must watch
","Starting with a house full theater my expectations were very high... As the story started , the director really connected with the audiences and the way ranjit katyal dances on the start of the movie just lighten up the show. Well I find the second half more promising but the first half also made a mark... with everything on its place with right songs at the right point , the movie was a perfect one with no defects at all.. and the way nimrat kaur scolded Joseph just made my day... and now 4 the Indian's its a movie u should spend some penny bcoz its really gonna make every Indian proud ... and really the movie lived on my expectations .. so without a doubt its 10 on 10",8,4,6,23 January 2016
