The Blair Witch Project," The Nightmare Maker.
","Seeing The Blair Witch Project was indeed an experience. The fear of the dark was thrown in my face not only while watching this masterpiece, but two days later trying to sleep, then 3 days, then 4 days. This movie forces you to use your imagination, which in my case, was the powerhouse of The Blair Witch Project. The fears of childhood sounds in the dark are amplified to the maximum. I will not forget this movie, ever!!",10,1,2,28 July 1999
