Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Hmmmmm .. very disappointed
","I was looking forward to this film simply because the first one just kept you on the end of your seat until the end and left you wanting...However, this was one was a major disappointment - too predictable, too pretentious and too, well, up Mr Tarantino's own backside.Tarantino's previously displayed talent for dialogue seemed to have deserted him - I think he has read too much of his own press and fawning critics.Don't get me wrong, Pulp Fiction and Dogs were fantabulous along with True Romance and Jackie Brown (in other words all his other films), but KB2 was a waste of 3 hours of my time. The usual sound in a film is popcorn being eaten and sweet wrappers being rustled - in KB2 it was snoring...The best bit? The ice cream before ....Wait until it comes out on video, and then don't hire it.....",9,2,4,16 May 2004
The Hangover," Once again it's all in the trailer
","I was really, really looking forward to this film. Every trailer I'd seen made me laugh.So Saturday night comes around. It's available through Virgin and so cuddle on the sofa with snacks and start watching it.Keep glancing at Hubbsta as he hadn't laughed once and I had to admit my laughter was a bit forced at times.It was a real shame as I think it could have had more potential. It's for the people who liked AnchorMan, 40 Year Old Virgin that kind of film.If anything, it had a sweetish ending.",2,5,12,9 January 2010
Troy," Remember, it's 'inspired' by The Iliad, not based on it
","OK .. I am a history buff and have read The Iliad, therefore I admit I was kind of dubious about going to see this film.However, as a film 'INSPIRED' by The Iliad, it was a worthwhile rendition. Achilles is arrogant and Mr Pitt managed that.  Paris was a coward, and Mr Bloom, again, had that spot on.  Mr Bana played Hector very well.  But with all characterisation, it is how the actor thinks the historical character would act.  We all have our own thoughts on how the character should act, but it's down to the actor and the director.  Yes, the gods should have been involved and there were many characters missed out.OK, there were huge flaws in the whole thing, but to have created the film 'BASED' on The Iliad would have been a more huge undertaking than The Lord of the Rings - the war lasts 10 years, and therefore a lot of time when nothing was happening .. trying to precis it into a 3 hour film takes some doing .. somethings have to be left out and there does have to be artistic licence.  I think when they decided it would be 'INSPIRED' by The Iliad, they just took the backbone of the story and not the flesh and skin, and therefore should be enjoyed as a mere shadow of The Iliad.For pure enjoyment factor, I give this film 8 out of 10.  For the historical factor, probably 3 out of 10.But remember, it's only 'INSPIRED' on The Iliad :)Bobb",8,1,3,2 July 2004
Thor: Ragnarok," I laughed and laughed until my throat was Thor!
","Liked first one, told second one was a bit dark so went straight to this one. My friend, who watched it with me was ready to throttle me as I giggled from beginning to end.",9,3,6,2 March 2019
Hellboy," Never read the comics, but loved the film
","I was a little dubious about watching this film, seeing as I had never read any of the comics.  Maybe that was a good thing because I didn't have anything to compare it with.However, for a fun couple of hours you can't beat it .. I sat there and I laughed and I smiled and I thought Hellboy was a really cool guy.  I have seen front covers of Hellboy and the makeup job on Ron Perlman was amazing.. I also liked the fact that it was not completely full of CGI .. there was a nice mix of that and using actors in rubber costumes.All in all, I give this film 10 out of 10 just for pure enjoyment factor.",10,0,1,5 August 2004
Dodgeball," I haven't laughed so much in ages
","I love Ben Stiller anyway and so really wanted to see this, and it didn't disappoint. Vince Vaughan was fab but I did miss Owen Wilson :(OK, it was very silly and purile and childish etc., but still, it was a couple of hours or so of good silly fun. And an awful lot of 'ouches' and 'oooh, that's gotta hurt' as well .. what you would come to expect ...We all knew how it was going to end etc., but there were still a few surprises.Enjoy it :D You won't be disappointed .... 'You are looking a bit fat in those trousers ... '",10,1,2,11 September 2004
