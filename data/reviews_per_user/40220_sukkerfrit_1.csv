First Man," Perfect capture of moments
","This movie capture the human moments just perfectly. I personally find this movie a marvel and a masterpiece. This is on of the few moves I have ever watched more than once. Watch this movie loud and with plenty of bass in the dark, enjoy the unexplained parts and when the moments are allowed to play out in its full length.",10,2,2,3 February 2020
