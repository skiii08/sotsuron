Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A great finale to a great revenge epic.
","Quentin Tarantino's second half of his epic is a true mark of a master filmmaker at his best. While the first film pays tribute to the highly stylize revenge films of the seventies, the last half pays tribute to the dark and complex films that made the seventies such a celebrated time in cinema. The story progresses into a moody and complex film about violence, honor and human frailty that is a true treat to behold. Any other filmmaker would have kept the pace of the first film by adding more violence but Tarantino gives a human aspect to the last half of his epic and makes his over the top characters more human and more complex in order to give the revenge aspect of the film a little more meaning. Uma Thurman once again is great as our heroine who still is after the man who wronged her and David Carradine is great as her nemesis Bill and he adds a funny, touching and yet menacing aspect to his character that makes his demise a real treat to wait for. This is a real classic in Pulp cinema and Quentin Tarantino cements his mark in cinematic history with this fine epic that will be celebrate for years to come.",Null,0,1,12 September 2004
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Much better than the first movie.
",Much better sequel to the original film that finally captures the essence of the game and adds a sense of dread to the party as well. Milla Jovovich gives a better performance this time around as Alice and Oded Fehr is just as strong as well. The special effects are much better as well as the cgi and the city setting is much creepier as well. It still has some of the problems of the first film like a short running time and weak plot development but the pros out weight the cons by a mile here. The score is better produced and the cinematography has more style here than the original. It still lacks the shock value of the game but it does come close to capturing it as well. Bring on part 3.,Null,0,0,10 September 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A spectacular excises in vengeance.
","The first half of Quentin Tarantino's revenge epic is a spectacular exercise in bloody stamina with Uma Thurman giving a great performance as the Bride, who seeks revenge against the man who wrong her. She goes to great lengths to get her man and in this first half of this epic, she goes though everyone and everything to get him. Expect to be shocked and wowed by what will happen on screen when she pursues her quarry, and expect to be dazzled. Hands down, this is Tarantino's best film since Pulp Fiction, and he proves once again to be the pinnacle of modern cinema. This is the first half of Tarantino's bloody soap opera, and the second half in my opinion is better than the first.",Null,0,1,12 September 2004
