Hereditary," When nightmares jump the shark, such a pity
","Note: no spoiler alert. It's already spoiled!
How this train wreck is so over rated might be a testament to legalized pot. This had so much potential, great actors, scary as hell story line, dark (a little too dark), gory but just couldn't pull it off. Had to get sloppy and stupid to explain itself toward the end. The plot was tortured into an ending stolen from so many other 'occult horror' films. The victims are the audience that watched this all the way to the silly end.",1,0,2,23 January 2019
