The Hangover," The greatest thing to happen since Wedding Crashers
","Yes, it's that good. I just got out of the theater, and instantly felt the need to write a gushing review for this movie.The premise, free of any major spoilers, is that four friends go to Vegas on a bachelor party, black out and lose the groom. Now this could have gone wrong in production, since a simple recounting of the crazy events would have made a funny but very ordinary movie. Instead, the movie focuses on the morning after, and laugh after laugh results from seeing crazy sh*t that transpired in the last 14 or so hours: including a tiger, Mike Tyson and a naked, angry Asian mobster (whose voice was stereotypically a bit reminiscent of Kim Jong Il from Team America).It's the characters that really make this movie. The groom doesn't really play that big a role; the future brother-in-law, Alan, and the two best friends, Stuart and Phil are hilarious. Alan is a weird and inappropriate guy that never fails to shock and produce hilarity, with memorable comments like 'Classic!', 'I find your language offensive' and the wolf pack speech. Phil is a bit more of a cliché, but he fills the void of the necessary 'cool guy' of the group, who likes having a crazy time. Stuart is a neurotic kind-of-dork-but-not-really, someone you sympathize with because he's totally whipped.In conclusion - I think this movie is a must see for anyone that enjoys this kind of humor. There are no fart jokes for the lowest common denominator, but there is an overload of genuinely witty banter and plot twists. There are no clichéd epiphanies or moralization. It's about a good time, perhaps too good a time, that went wrong, that'll make you want to hop in your car and drive to Vegas. This movie really took a trite topic - the bachelor party - and turned it into a great plot, great characters, hilarious lines and a satisfying ending.Definitely a 10.",10,5,8,6 June 2009
