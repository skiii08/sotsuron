The Blair Witch Project," Brilliantly contrived and utterly spooky
","In July of 1999, two aspiring filmmakers released a low-budget documentary-style horror film into theaters across North America. 87 minutes later, millions are afraid of the forest.'The Blair Witch Project' is supported by an absolutely ingenious concept: three college students set out to shoot a documentary on the Blair Witch, a local legend, and are never seen alive again. Well, not if you count the chilling peek the audience gets into their final days in the form of the footage shot by the filmmakers, as we watch with mounting suspense as they near their fates.What is so frightening about 'The Blair Witch Project' is not what we do see in the end but what we don't. So abstract are the final minutes of film that the imagination of the audience is forced to take over, and that is the stuff that sleepless nights are made of.I can't guarantee that everyone will be scared or even amused by 'Blair,' but I can tell you that I am not easily scared by a film, and this movie spooked me more than anything I have ever seen. I highly recommend it to people with an open mind and an appreciation for inventive filmmaking.",Null,1,1,11 August 1999

","Matt Damon gives a top-notch performance in 'Good Will Hunting,' as does the Oscar-winning Robin Williams. The great job of un-showy directing keeps the attention on the story. A heart-warming movie with a tight, award-winning script and wonderful acting. Not recommended for those who cannot stomach crude sexual humor. B",Null,0,1,2 August 1998

","Definitely one of the best films of all time. Kubrick has created a masterpiece of the human mind that has never been attacked with such audacity before or since. Based upon the Anthony Burgess novel (classic science fiction), this is not a movie that I'd recommend to the weak of heart. A",10,4,7,10 August 1998

","'Titanic,' the high-budget, much-hyped romance/disaster epic, is a great movie despite its dragging three-hour length. It didn't deserve all the Oscars it won, as nearly everyone agrees, and I take pity on the poor soles who think that this is the greatest movie of all time. People, it's a good movie, but not the best of all-time. And it was the unfortunate iceberg in the way of the best film of 1997, 'L.A. Confidential.' A-",8,1,1,2 August 1998

","'Scream' does not seem like the kind of movie that could make you appreciate American cinema. If you haven't seen it, then you're probably viewing it as just another silly slasher flick that creates more laughs than scares. On the contrary. This movie IS filled with plenty of scares and satirizes the horror genre in a way that literally has turned this film into a masterpiece. I guarantee you that while you may not love it (it nearly was rated NC-17 for its intense violence), you'll be highly amused by this one. A-",10,143,192,16 August 1998

","'Halloween' is, aside from maybe 'Psycho,' the greatest horror film ever made and is a true classic of cinema. There are moments when the suspense becomes too much and one literally has to pause the tape and take a breather. John Carpenter's direction is superb and Curtis's career-launching performance is definitely atypical among slasher flicks. Pop some popcorn and be prepared to cover your eyes at all times.
