Blade Runner 2049," What Else is Perfect?
","A stunning story that drives its events around a unique cornerstone, just as Blade Runner (1982). Although not explicitly mentioned in both movies but left for the audience to acquire, is about the sole which a non-human can develop. Some reviews mentioned that it lacks deep dramatic reactions, but this is in favor of the story, considering the main objective is not about picturing emotions' depth, but about existence.It is a throughout story where some of the scenes in the movie need pages to be described, and some events that took no more than 10 seconds in the movie will be stretched out in other sci-fi movies for 20+ minutes, and all came in a continuous sequence here. Visual effects are state of the art by all means. The music in this movie has a character by its own, it has a very strong presence just like in the classical (previous) part. All actors made their roles perfectly - except the role by Jared Leto which is kinda draw back in the whole momentum of the movie, thankfully it was a minor role. There are too many good things to be mentioned which made this a very entertaining hard-core science fiction movie, such as picturing the future of some regions, the yet-to-be nature of complexity of human beings in the next few decades, the expected environmental effects on everything, the unstoppable power development of political systems, very possible future gadgets and accessories, etc. This leaves one asking himself: if this is not The perfect sci-fi movie, then what else is?Highly recommended for everyone, and I am sure I will watch it again.10/10.",10,2,10,26 August 2018
Passengers," One of a Kind - of the Greatest
","(Please note that this review might contain spoilers).If you have enjoyed the historic sci-fi movie, 2001: A Space Odyssey, then you'll probably fall in love with Passengers (2016). There is a lot of choices for all sorts of professionals working in movie making, the novelist chooses what details he uses to build the story, the director selects the ways he sees fit to lead the actors, ..etc.; and in this movie it seems to me that all professionals have made the excellent choices. The story of Passengers (2016) is extremely balanced. For those who criticize some role that appeared and disappeared without reason, I want them to imagine how boring and complicated the story will be if extra characters were emotionally involved, or how strange it'll be for a major incident to affect only one person. The selection of how events went by, has made the story to bring heavy-weight ideas, about human emotional and reasonable behavior, how a crisis may affect reason and how reason changes a crisis. The story is a nicely ordered hard-core sci-fi, means the science facts were fully respected during all parts (not like other over-rated ridiculous sci-fi movies such as Arrival). Visuals are extraordinarily beautiful, alongside a very precise and professional directing. 
The start of the movie is pretty powerful, as the end is. Passengers is a great movie, and deserves general rating of 9 at least. 10/10 without a moment pause.",10,3,4,14 May 2018
The Day After Tomorrow," The Best Apocalyptic Weather Movie
","To say first, it is one of the most underrated movies I could think of. The movie attempts to deliver an imagine about how global weather will be in the (perhaps very) near future. Regardless the faults from rigid science facts about the size of this and the nature of that, the movie gives a glimpse about the possible troubles humanity might face if the changes in the global weather kept going on at its present rate. It is not a science movie, but a science fiction one. Indeed the story took wrong the sizes of somethings and natures of a few stuff, but the main line of the story is perfectly scientific, clearly stating that one bad effect can lead to another bad effect, and that leads to another, with no upper limit but possible total destruction of life itself; making the movie as an absolutely entertaining and definitely thought-provoking. The Day After Tomorrow is the first of a kind in this area of movies, rightfully gained its position due to the perfect sequence of events, directing and acting. I love it!",9,3,4,23 May 2018
Deadpool 2," Great Everything
","It is hard to give a comment about this movie without using any F word (Fantastic, Fine, Funny, Fabulous, ..) or an S one (Smart, Super, Sarcastic, Seriously Entertaining, ...). It kept me attached to the screen literally from minute 0 till the end of the final title. I will watch it again at least 2 more times. Recommended, but not for not grownups. It is a movie that makes one thinks a lot about all kinds of Special High Intensity Training, aka.. um.. well.. Anyways, you will type similar things immediately after watching it. I loved it!",9,3,5,25 September 2018
Interstellar," Great, entertaining, amazing
","This is a sort of movies that leave some mark when watching it once. The story makes one thinks about the nature, physics, the universe, and life. 'How many thoughts a movie can give' is a great criterion that I use to decide how much I enjoyed any movie, and Interstellar gave me a lot of new thoughts. After finishing watching this movie I kept imagining those various, interesting situations given in it. The parts dealing with physics in this movie are very well written and directed, and the net result of what it looked like is awesome, just awesome. The story: Perfect, keeps attracting through the movie, until the part is reached when it confuses concepts of time travel at the very end of the movie (I'm not going to spoil it). This is why I didn't rate it a full 10 stars. Everything else is awesome, acting, filmography and directing, visual effects, and (specially) the music! I'd recommend it for physicists-and artists as well.",10,1,2,29 April 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," WATCH IT IF YOU WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME
","It is a total waste of time to watch all these big names making so terrible movie. Maybe it is overrated because it captures how a simple-minded person thinks about his or Her right to curse and swear all the time. The painful part is to watch these great names participating in this poor movie. It should be called 'The Fool's Cheap and Disgusting Propaganda, Outside Ebbing, Missouri.'",1,5,8,1 June 2018
Bird Box," Intense!
","The movie has an absolutely original story, and what appeared as a similarity to earlier movies soon turned out to be a wrong judgment. I think the story of Bird Box was extremely hard to be written in this balance because there is a basic part in the story where a question is rudely asked about what a mother is, how great a mother is, .. no.. how holy a other is!This is the greatest and most emotionally intensive part, and the most touchy one, yet it's not the only one in this story. So from the beginning till the end there can't be any boring minute in Bird Box.A fantastic sci fi movie and I can bet with all my money that, if the main role was given to other than Sandra Bullock, the movie and the story would not turned to be this great.This is a kind of a movie that leaves a mark. I loved it and would like to give a big hand for the writer and director, and send a big hug for Sandra Bullock for the huge amount of emotions she transferred successfully across the screen. The effort she put in this movie is absolutely great. Bravo!",10,6,15,24 December 2018
The Revenant," Outstanding Movie
","Screenplay and visuals of this movie are so beautiful that force to watch many of its scenes over again to absorb their wonderfulness. Many abstract scenes are very well put in The Revenant, such as those of the wildness, loyalty and unfaithfulness, toleration, war, gratitude and vengeance; all sewed in a continuous and beautiful harmony. It is a kind of movie that drives the audience from the start to the end, in an intensified focus about all its characters and events. If it wasn't the important role yet weak performance of the 'stupid kid', I'd give it 10/10 without a second thought. Still, The Revenant is one of the best, and definitely worth to be watched again.",9,1,2,12 May 2018
Gone Girl," Super Boring
","I don't know how I managed to complete 2h+ of this pile of lazy film. Is it a classical boring hide and seek? Is it just another boring criminal drama? Or is it just a boring, boring drama flavored with boring crime story?
If someone cuts 2/3rds of the movie it will still tell the same story. But doing so will remove this movie from the boring genre to another one, so no one did that, and here it is: A Glorious Boring Movie.
Avoid unless you have an extra time to waste.",3,0,4,29 October 2019
Django Unchained," Quite Entertaining
","Filled with serious action and comedy, a lot of surprises, and sarcasm. I really can't say a lot about movie details because they're all so well made. At around minute 50 of the movie I told myself 'Oh wow the fun isn't over yet!'However I'd mention that it got a very professional cast and crew that successfully approached a dark historical period in such a dangerous (sarcastic) way -- which also makes reason why some reviewers totally disliked it, leading to underrating this great movie. This is a very entertaining action movie. Recommended to be watched carefully. 9/10 and I'd give it a whole 10 if the end was less hilarious. I liked it!",9,2,5,21 June 2018
The Mountain II," Total Waste of Time
","With rating more than 9, I expected to see a unique movie, an outstanding acting, an out-of-this-earth novel, and a brilliant directing. None of that is there, NONE, nothing, zippo, null. 
I do not believe I've wasted 2 hrs 15 mins on this absurd, funny military propaganda. I gave it 3/10, and I am being generous here.",1,187,386,18 April 2018
Arrival," A Total Waste of Time
","Bad writing, worse filming, utterly unspeakable bad acting. After I finished watching it, I ended up with zero ideas, zero information, or simply zero entertainment. The story is based on how to make curvy letters using ink, and that's it, nothing else is there to mention. It should be called 'Nonsense'.",1,4,10,12 April 2018
Cloud Atlas," Epic, Unique
","It's one of a kind. At one hand each of those stories is unique in a way it fits for a dependent movie, and they are joined in the series of the events at the other hand. The duplicity of actors in all of these stories adds a very special taste to the whole movie.
One Big Bravo!",9,3,6,9 August 2019
Moon," Outstanding, one of the best sci-fi
","It is a movie that has great elements. Maybe this is Sam Rockwell's best acting, filled with passion in scenes that get interesting as the story develops, in a very entertaining sequence of scenes that kept me attached to watching it since the early minutes. Although most of these scenes tried (successfully) to picture quite complex drama from the beautiful story, but Rockwell added his own touch to most of these scenes, mostly due to (maybe) his own natural personality, his facial expressions, his voice, .. those many little things that a professional actor uses to make you forget for a moment that this is a sci-fi movie. Moon has many of such moments in fact. I didn't believe at first that this is the first real cinema movie made by the director Duncan Jones. It was a very solid cornerstone, and there is no surprise that it was followed by a series of great movies, Source Code (2011), and Warcraft (2016). The movie is perfect. I liked it a lot. 
9/10.",9,1,1,19 August 2018
