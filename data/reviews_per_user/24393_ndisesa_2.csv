First Man," This film takes your breath away and breaks your heart
","For the first half of First Man you feel like you are IN the rickety capsules that hurled these brave men farther into space than anyone had ever gone before. The second half of the film shows you what Neil Armstrong went through emotionally. Ryan Gosling gives a brilliant performance and Claire Foy takes charge of the film. It is brilliantly directed by Damian Chazelle and the writing is minimally, beautifully and painfully perfect. I bought James R Hanson's book. Can't wait to see this film again.",10,2,7,15 October 2018
Munich," Brilliant Film
","This is a long film but I can't imagine anyone being bored or confused (a la Seriana) for the entire film. What a performance by all the fine actors in this film, so artfully directed that you can almost forget it's a movie. It's real and true, but not a boring (a la Good Night and Good Luck).Spielberg is our greatest director and this is by far his best film. Itis an exhausting and exhilarating film, although the facts are eithertrue or too close to the possibility of being true to be comforting.The ending is very touching and it would be wise not to take your eyesoff the screen until the credits are rolling. Great part for Eric Banaand a nice introduction to Daniel Craig in his first blockbuster beforehe becomes the new 007. This sure to win Best Picture in all the contests.",10,3,5,25 December 2005
