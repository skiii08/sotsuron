Hereditary," Much too slow for my taste
","Seeing the numerous critics reviews of the movie and being a huge fan of horror, I decided to give it a shot. While the acting is top notch across the board and Toni Collette in particular hits it out of the park, the movie itself was too slowly paced and I found myself glancing at my watch quite a few times throughout. Some of the twists towards the end in the main leads also left me scratching my head.Bottom line- if you appreciate great acting and can stand the slow pace, give this a shot else if you are looking for a great horror movie, stay sway.",5,1,2,20 June 2018
