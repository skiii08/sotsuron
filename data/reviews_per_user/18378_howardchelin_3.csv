Frost_Nixon," Sympathy Gor The Devil
","Some movies are worth seeing in their totality because they are overall just excellent films encompassing great storylines, breathtaking cinematography, deft direction and fine acting. Some may find the pacing of this film too slow, the cinematography uninspiring and the direction unexceptional ( I am not of any of these opinions by the way ) but the one aspect of this film that is indisputable, is the incredible acting performance by Frank Langella as Richard M Nixon. When an actor is able to make you feel sympathy for a politician of Nixon's obvously dubious moral character, you indeed have something very special. Nominated and robbed in my opinion for a best actor Oscar, Langella is absolutely riveting in displaying a full canvas of human emotions ranging from egotistical, arrogant and insensitive to loving, caring and pathetic. Even if you don't like the film overall, Langella's performance is worth the price of admission alone.",9,0,0,20 June 2019
The Untouchables," Soulless Attempt
",Complete flop that despite a cast that includes Robert Deniro and Sean Connery fails to capture even one iota of the drama and atmosphere of the famous 1950's t.v. series. Lacks any emotional payoff or satisfaction whatsoever.,4,1,9,1 June 2019
Murder on the Orient Express," Why Bother?
","What was the purpose in making this poorly cast remake for the umpteenth time? The movie rings false on every front, failing to suspend disbelief even for one brief second. Neither the time period nor the era seems genuine at all. I like to refer to this effect as 'clean dirty' meaning that any attempts to make one feel that the events are actually taking place in that particular time period look as though they took brand new movie sets and artificially dirtied them. Think of all the good purposes that they could have put this wasted money toward.",5,2,3,6 March 2019
