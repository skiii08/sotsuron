The Equalizer," Denzel at his best in a vigilante/mob/action
","A mob/action movie with a traditional subject that might be predictable in the big lines but not in the detail work; the stress is taking an unhurried pace to weave around and from the fascinating main character. I probably gave it an 8 because I really love Denzel Washington and his acting and this is one of the roles he CAN as no other (controlled dangerous, melancholic, introvert, own-moral vigilante); there is a dark, irresistible, edgy streak of 'lonely wolf' solitude in his eyes different than the sad puppy-look of Will Smith (no offense). Some standard characters are present but at the right time in the right place to make the story go. Watch it.",8,0,3,4 January 2015
