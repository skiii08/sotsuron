Blade Runner 2049," I was hyped about this movie
","Hello everyone. I will be really basic because i dont want to waste my time to write decent review because this really dont deserve. I started reviewing movies because i really cant belive that some movies have above 7.0 and they dont even deserve 7.0! This movie have 8.0 I mean what?!
Okay i started watching it was great cinematic exp great beggining but then, i felt ,i started yawning and i mean YAWNING. Thousands of meaningless sentences that really didnt have nothing to say or to understand (you still can understand whats gonna happen if you know what i mean) or to keep me tense.
Idk did Ridley Scott fall asleep when he was shooting this movie or what. I wanted some more action, better mystery with better written realization, but this, I really lost my time. I was waiting Harison Ford because i thought he will change things in this movie but then again same.
Pointless meaningless sentences and less action. What i mean when i say meaningless senteces. Just compare talking in this movie with example Shutter Island. Shutter Island is based on conversation but the movie keeps me awake, eyes were open all the time, but this one didnt do it, and im a big fan of sci-fi, cyberpunk ,mystery, thriller genres.
I was thinking that this movie will be similar to serie Altered Carbon that i watched.
Good action, thriller, mystery, idea pure perfection , good written scenario sentences, realization.Thats what you need in world of cyberpunk! Total blast with sick ending, like Altered Carbon was. And that i recommend to everyone who likes this genre!
I'm sad i have to give this movie for sci-fi genre a grade like this but well deserved grade, and its only because of cinematic and shots that were taken of cyberpunk vibe.
It has those moments but then again. Its okay that movie is based most of time on conversation investigation and so on, but then do it with a style so i do not YAWN in front of my monitor if you know what i mean. I'll probably never recommend to anyone this movie.  6/10.",6,1,3,7 November 2019
The Martian," I expected something more tense then this.
","Whats with this world? Something is really overated and something is underrated. Underated like Terminator Salvation,Event Horizon and similar sci-fi, but this , 8.0 i mean what!?
This movie had good start , but after he lost his crew and he was solo accidentally on this planet i expected he is going to loose insanity now and start having hallucinations. I mean u are relaxed alone in planet and u are all doing fine throughout entire years without loosing your mind... They better had this tense mind blow stuff throughout this movie and weird hallucinations because you getting crazy by being solo, then soft movie like this one. IDK i was really bored watching. I really like Matt Damon and his movies but this one nah. Even his movie Elysium i found better and underated then this one.",5,1,1,7 November 2019
