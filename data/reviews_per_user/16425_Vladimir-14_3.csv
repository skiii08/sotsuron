Blade Runner 2049," Perfect cinematic accomplishment worth 35 years of waiting
","First off, I did my home work and re-watched the original movie a day ago. This really helped with the sequel as no references were lost on me (or so I hope). Highly recommend for everyone to do the same, as it has been a while since the release of the first one. Secondly, I watched this film in IMAX, to get 20% extra experience. I am glad I did both, as I was rewarded with cinematic sci-fi treat of highest grade. I've seen some reviewers complaining it being slow. Well, I did not even notice how 2.5 hours passed. I was waiting for more. So, if it is slow - it's in a good way - giving a viewer a chance to savor every scene. There is not much else that can be said without spoilers. This is an old-fashion sci-fi that does not rely on CGI visuals to carry the story. The visuals are great, but they are what they should be - backdrop. Also, IMHO a rare case when sequel surpasses the original. I do hope they will go for a sequel, and I do hope they will not make us wait another 35 years.",10,3,10,8 October 2017
War Dogs," War is a terrible thing, but it is a terribly profitable thing
","Just got to watch this movie on the pre-screening. It is so good, that I wonder if I somehow can pay for the tickets? Everything is good about this movie: story, acting, camera, humor. I was glad to see the director getting over the Hangovers and doing something different for a change. To me it is definitely a step up for Phillips. Two hours went by so fast that ending seemed to be a bit rushed, but I have to trust that that how the original story went. It is not an instant classic of the Revenant proportions, but if the subject is appealing to you at all - it is worth watching. The voting is not yet enabled, but when it will be I give this title 8 out of 10.",8,6,17,9 August 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," Saviour Private Doss
","Just watched this movie at the pre-screening and feel like I owe it to the creators to write a review. Having read other reviews, it is hard to stay original, so first are few thoughts that I shared with the others. Great to have Mel Gibson back in the directors seat. I will be surprised if we don't see this film in a few Oscars categories. Now, few thoughts of my own. The movie depicts brutality of war in gory details, so much so, that I had to turn my eyes away from screen couple of times. However, I do understand why this was important to the story line. It was done so that we could truly appreciate Doss's act of bravery, feel it like we were there and witnessed it firsthand - nothing was left out. The story grabs you from beginning and does not let you off until very end - after the movie I turned back and half of the girls in the theater were still wiping tears. Bottom line - instant classic that will find it's place on the shelf next to the likes of Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers.",9,173,258,2 November 2016
