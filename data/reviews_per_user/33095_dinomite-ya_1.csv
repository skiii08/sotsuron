The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Great Movie, Disappointing Ending.
","I am a huge fan of the Hunger Games Series, and this film was great... But, not perfect. You start the movie down below District 13, but you don't know that until about ten minutes in. A bad beginning, but the movie goes on to please. With introductions of new characters, new scenery, and spot on visuals, nothing disappoints. Even the acting is as good as ever, if not the best in the franchise. But it's down falls come in mellow conversations, and lame 'action' sequences. But where Mockingjay goes on to disappoint the most is it's ending. I know they are trying to lead on to the next movies, but in the end you are left with a unfinished scene. This movies would have gotten a ten, as for I really enjoyed. But the ending truly ruined what could have been.",8,2,16,18 December 2014
