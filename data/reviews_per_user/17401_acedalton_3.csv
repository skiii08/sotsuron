The Blair Witch Project," One of the scariest movies
","A lot of people say they don't like this movie, but I did.  I think the realism this movie is awesome.  I think it makes a movie scarier if you think it could actually happen.  In fact a lot of people I have talked to thought The Blair Witch Project was real.  It will define horror for this generation like Halloween and Dracula did for their respective generations. This movie is scary and freaked me out.  I still get chills when I watch this movie.",10,1,3,15 November 2001
The Ring," Wow!!! The Ring is very scary!!!
","I walked into this movie liking the basic premise and walked out feeling terrified.  I have not been this scared in a long time.  Someone I went to movie with said that a movie has never affected him to the degree 'The Ring' did.This may be a dawning of a new age of horror.  I never had the privilege mostly because of my lack of age to sit through first running of horror classics.  Tonight I thought I wonder if people felt like this when they sat through 'Psycho', 'The Exorcist', or 'Halloween' for the first time.  I once said the 'The Blair Witch Project' would define the horror genre for years to come.  'The Ring' might surpass anything 'The Blair Witch Project' can spawn.  I am a horror fanatic and this film scares me in ways I have never been scared before.  It plays on things we find true in the genre of horror and turns it.  Wow this film is great.",10,0,0,19 October 2002
Halloween," The best horror movie ever made!
",This movie is the one of my favorites of all-time.  It is definitely the best horror movie ever made.  I haven't seen anything like it.This film set a standard for other horror movie to set against.  The character of Michael Myers is just scary.  The silent killer who stalks his victims.  The music is the soundtrack of your nightmares.  The setting is so much like the town I grew up in the Midwest. If you are a horror film fan and you haven't seen this film you are missing out on a legendary tale of fear.,10,0,0,19 October 2001
