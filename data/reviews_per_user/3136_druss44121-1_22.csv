Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," The worst Pirates film yet, truly awful
","So you know where I stand, I loved Pirates 1. It was 'fun', it was epic, it was clever and funny. It might have had some pacing problems, but it's still the epitome of what an action/adventure should be - and it's still fun to watch 8 years later.Meanwhile, I thought Pirates 2 was epic. I actually think it's quite a bit underrated, and though it has about 20 minutes where it loses focus, otherwise it keeps taking you somewhere new. The cannibal island wasn't at all a waste either, it re-united all the characters and was a fun sequence. I thought it rivaled the first, and overall wasn't quite as clever as #1 but it was even bigger in scope. To me Pirates 2 is what a summer blockbuster should be.Pirates 3, however, I thought was terrible, and almost unwatchable, though it had moments of brilliance, namely the 'at world's end' scenes. I've only seen it twice, and will likely never watch it again in my life.So here we are at Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. I wasn't expecting brilliance, but I was hoping for a fun summer pirates adventure. Something along the lines of the first, maybe not quite as clever, but still good fun.Instead I got a laborious, muddy film with little joy or cleverness. It was a chore to sit through, much as I felt about At World's End, but unlike that film this one doesn't even have the occasional moments of brilliance (like the 'world's end' scenes in 3 which were very zany and unique; here, you never really see any stranger tides).What's worst is there's some cool ideas here. The ships in the bottles, Blackbeard, Barbossa working for the king, the whole idea of a 'race' for the fountain of youth, hell, the FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH. So many cool things and none of them go anywhere. There are no real characters or character arcs. Nothing happens with anyone, nobody 'changes' or goes on a journey of any sort of their own.I know character development might not have been the strong suit of the earlier films, but usually there were the basics, especially in the first: you knew what people wanted, and why, and understood why they were doing what they were doing to get it. And the character's had their own personalities, and were unique from one another.But most of all this film just wasn't fun. There were very few clever or quotable lines. It was the smallest in scale of all 4 films, and the set pieces besides the mermaid attack were all underwhelming and occasionally even boring. The mermaid attack was cool, but there was some shoddy CGI and they never really went anywhere with it. You never really get the sense that it's a 'race' for the fountain of youth, and the script could have done a lot more with its premise.For starters, I'd say lose Barbossa, have Cruz be with the Spanish, but still the daughter of Blackbeard, and have it be a 3-way race between her, Jack and Blackbeard. Make the fountain of youth sequence more than a poor rip-off of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Do something new, perhaps give Jack a more serious dilemma to face in the 2nd act that makes him more than just a clown. This film has no pulse.And I don't understand how anyone could dislike Dead Man's Chest and like this. On Stranger Tides was talkie, and all the double-triple cross stuff mainly didn't come in until #3. Dead Man's Chest was an easier to follow plot than this, and the characters had more complexity and clarity than here. The production design was also a marvel. On Stranger Tides, meanwhile, rarely feels like you're in the Caribbean, and the sets stick out like a sore thumb from the location stuff.3/10... it'd be lower, except I know movies like Batman & Robin exist, so I have to adjust accordingly.",2,8,15,20 May 2011
Lucky Number Slevin," Lucky Indeed
","A movie with a title as stupid as Lucky Number Slevin needs to have a lot working in its favor. Thankfully, what might seem like another Snatch meets Pulp Fiction rip off actually proves to be a worthy addition to the silver screen.Following our main character Slevin (Josh Hartnett), we find a simple case of mistaken identity. Slevin has come to stay at the apartment of his friend Nick, but Nick never shows up.Soon he is visited by the girl next door (played by Lucy Liu), and finds himself in the middle of a gang war between the boss (Morgan Freeman) and the Rabbi (Ben Kingsley, credited as Sir Ben Kingsley because the actor must have an inferiority complex.) What will happen next? Will Slevin live? Why is his identity mistaken? Thankfully there are answers, and they aren't disappointing ones, either.The acting, script and direction are all top notch. Director Paul McGuigan handles the large cast well. Every actor plays the part right, including Josh Hartnett who is quite a bit better here than he was in Pearl Harbor.Morgan Freeman and Bruce Willis play roles similar to some stuff they've done before (no, Morgan Freeman is not God again), but they do a fine job at it.Much of the on screen time takes place in New York, and there is an interesting artistic style that has flair without being overtly flashy. There is even a visual effect shot that efficiently sets up the conflict between the warring mob bosses.One thing, however, that may be surprising is the amount of violence.Although the film is never gratuitous with its bullet holes, there are moments of visual bloodshed and intrinsic nastiness. A somewhat fun, light-hearted mood permeates most of the time, yet at heart Lucky Number Slevin is a drama.There are also some pretty nifty action scenes, as McGuigan demonstrates a unique directorial style. There is more than just action, though, and the dialogue itself is usually sharp.At times it heavily resembles the blissful operatic ramblings of Quentin Tarantino, but the real joy here is the story and the way it is told.I love when movies have lots of little details that are wrapped up in the end.This is perhaps the best attribute of Lucky Number Slevin, as all the little pieces of the puzzle come together.Sometimes too many plot elements are crammed into one little monologue to explain an entire movie, but here every little twist and surprise is revealed at the right time and in an appealing way.The script is smart, and for the most part it properly balances light-hearted humor with serious dramatic moments. It seems actual thought and care went into the narrative structure.Ultimately, Lucky Number Slevin ends on a high note.A successful mix of a crime caper, a drama, a situation comedy and a mystery, the film knows when to borrow and when to pave a path of its own. There is enough originality to make it worth the time, and it successfully tells an interesting story distinctly.Critic's Conclusion: Dramatic, funny and smart, Lucky Number Slevin is a successful collage of genres. Don't let the title fool you, there is more here than first meets the eye.",7,3,11,8 April 2006
United 93," This is a hard film to review.
","Before seeing United 93, I had many doubts. Natural questions arise when discussing the first Hollywood recreation of 9/11.Should this have been made? What can be taken from it? Will it just be an offensive or heartless manipulation of a real tragedy? There is little doubt that simply as a film, United 93 is well made. It is expertly paced, it is involving and it captures the chaos of that Tuesday morning.Director Paul Greengrass uses mainly hand-held cameras, giving a similar 'you are there' feel as his last film, the hit sequel The Bourne Supremacy. Random bouncing around is toned down a bit, though, so if you got sea-sick during Bourne you can rest a little easier here.Most of the running time is spent either on flight 93, which was the fourth plane that crashed in Pennsylvania, or around various air control or military rooms. Nothing is shown from Ground Zero.Greengrass walks a very tight rope, managing not to become exploitive while also not falling into extreme political correctness.His film is brutal at points, but never gratuitous. The way the reactions of everyone in the film are portrayed helps to humanize them, since we all had similar responses on September 11th.Even if a vivid back-story is not presented for each person, little distance is felt. Sometimes it is possible to relate through circumstance, and the fact that there are no marquee name stars helps the actors become their characters. Some of the officials in the control rooms actually play themselves, too.This gives an authenticity to the film that is needed, especially since it comes so soon after the attacks.Of course, following Fahrenheit 9/11 anything that remotely touches on controversial or political ideas is considered one-sided propaganda. Conspiracy theory nuts especially have used this to bring down United 93 and the people behind it.However, any film or art form cannot truly be neutral, and this is a good thing. It is why  as filmgoers  we should use our own intelligence and rationality, never only taking what we see on screen as gospel. Art should make us question rather than blindly accept.With this said, here is a film that is constructed with passion and care, attempting to recreate an experience rather than further an agenda.The portrayal of the terrorists is perhaps the hardest challenge. Their evil is not overemphasized. The film opens with them praying, and it gives a glimpse into their fanatical religious beliefs that lead them to believe murdering thousands of Americans is a solution for anything.This makes the tragedy all the more palatable, since we are not watching inhuman monstrosities rampaging, but rather people doing horrible things to other people.This inherent tragedy helps to make the heroism at the end seem true, rather than forced and sentimental. United 93 shows, without preaching, the way people can bind together to kill each other, and also bind together to do the opposite.Still, not everything about United 93 works.One scene involving a passenger who wants to acquiesce to all the terrorists' commands is overdone, and it feels like a fake Hollywood invention.The amount of text after the harrowing end  which eerily reveals death as well as cinema can  is somewhat distancing. It would have been better and more effective if there wasn't an immediate bombardment of historical facts we already know.In the end, United 93's greatest strength is its greatest weakness. The fact that it has no political ambitions or fiery declarations lets the emotion of what it shows seem fresh, real, and genuine.The confusion, fear, and unification that came from these attacks are perfectly captured, although little is said that is groundbreaking or philosophically revolutionary.'Why' is not as important as 'what.' United 93 is ultimately a reminder.While remembering an event that happened less than five years ago might seem superfluous, this is not so much a reminder of the physical, actual event which is impossible to forget, but of the emotions that arose that day and what was created from these emotions.9/11 has become a punch line for politicians, the memories we all carry abused and torn apart by vehement partisan anger.The title might seem cheesy but it signifies the central theme that runs throughout this tragic but heroic tale.For all that was destroyed in the attacks, something was gained. America found a new connection, a connection that went beyond conspiracy theories or liberal/conservative politics.The fact that United 93 captures this connection at all is proof that, despite any flaws, it is not too soon for this film, and that its greatest message is not delivered in a long-winded monologue but discovered in the emotions simmering right until the end.Critic's Conclusion: Not necessarily an easy film to sit through, United 93 comes at the right time. Unlikely to find a large audience now, those willing to give it a chance might be surprised at the emotions it carefully exposes.",8,4,7,2 May 2006
Silent Hill," Insert clever title here
","Attention all: please welcome video game adaptation number 32, Silent Hill. Here we have a lovely specimen, a film that actually stands out from the pack.Our main character is Rose, the mother of an adopted little girl named Sharon. Sadly, little Sharon has been acting weird thanks to some high-risk sleep walking. Worse, she keeps mumbling about a mysterious town called Silent Hill.Rose decides the best solution to cure her daughter is to bring her to Silent Hill and discover exactly what is going on. Of course her husband does not approve, but it doesn't matter since there isn't much time to reflect on the situation at all.Silent Hill delves right into the action.In fact, within 10 minutes Rose is already stranded at the mysterious Silent Hill.While it's nice to not have to wade through pointless exposition that exists only to give the illusion of an actual story, there is no time to bond with the characters at all.The problem is not so much that we need a half hour of superfluous back story, but that too little time is focused on the main characters as people merely trying to live their lives.Thus, they become artificial cardboard cutouts. There is never a sense of panic or fear.As strange and sinister as Silent Hill can be, it's never genuinely scary because there is never any real connection to a human figure.The acting doesn't help much, either, with Sean Bean phoning in his performance as the worried dad and Jodelle Ferland doing her best 'creepy girl from The Ring' impression. Lead actress Radha Mitchell plays a convincing mother, though her entire performance is fairly one note.However, one thing about Silent Hill stands out in an extraordinary way.Simply put, French director Christophe Gans knows how to sculpt moving images.Much like his last film, the stylish but complex The Brotherhood of the Wolf, the assorted mix of odd environments and crazed fiends fill a dark void that is anything but empty.With a surrealist look reminiscent of earlier European horror, Silent Hill is able to stretch out from the screen and into the mind.Now, it is absolutely true that great visuals cannot make a bad movie great.To be fair, horror films are hardly heralded for brilliant character development or complex stories. Nevertheless, this does not mean that these elements are useless.And no doubt, if Silent Hill had a stronger script it could truly have been a brilliant little film.Thankfully these flaws don't sink the entire production. Even as the vague plot lurches to its halfway satisfactory climax, it is hard to turn away.This is a movie for the fans, and it includes many horror movie musts. There are especially scenes of great carnage, including a gruesome finale and the untimely demise of one character whose clothes are torn off in one fell swoop, followed by their skin.Yet, Silent Hill is more than a pointless gore fest.Although a level of realism is purposely lost, something distinctive is always waiting to echo from the darkness. A curiosity as to what could be around the next corner keeps boredom at bay.Admittedly, though, the ending is weak.First we have the wonderful 'Harry Potter' monologue where most of the story is summarized in a short spouting of clunky dialogue. Then there is the obligatory ambiguous finale that is not so much clever as it is predictable and disappointing.In some ways, the problems with the plot are because Silent Hill is such a faithful and direct adaptation of its source material. Many videogames are very clearly influenced by films, and what might be original in one medium becomes tired and overused in another.Still, Silent Hill is an interesting journey that feels dredged up straight from a nightmare.Gans will not convert nonbelievers to the world of horror, but for those who have played the game or seek something unusual, there is quite a bit to appreciate here.Critic's Conclusion: It is probably the best video game to film adaptation so far (not that this is saying much), and despite inherent flaws with basic concepts of story and characters, Silent Hill compels attention.",6,2,4,22 April 2006
Hotel Rwanda," More than just an African 'Schindler's List'
","Based on the 1994 genocide between the African 'tribes' of the Hutu's and the Tutsi's, Hotel Rwanda has gotten decidedly mixed reviews. Before seeing the film, I was a little surprised since such subject matter alone is usually powerful enough to lead a film to critical acclaim. After seeing the film, though, I was incredibly surprised, as this is one of the most powerful and harrowing films I've seen in a year. It moved me in a way most films fail to do.Documenting a sadly little known event from just a mere decade ago, when nearly a million Rwandans were killed brutally with machetes and other weapons in the short time span of two months, everything within the film works. It never becomes manipulative or sentimental, always letting the emotions flow naturally. It also never becomes a blood fest, instead letting the majority of the violence be seen in small glimpses. It is an effective strategy that actually shocks more than any amount of hacked limbs and bloodied faces could.However, the film does become a wagging finger at those around the world that did not do enough, or anything. Yet, it does not blame without a purpose. This is a film that urges it's viewer not only to look back at history and have a reaction, but to look at today and forward into the future and to seek out the injustices that occur now so that perhaps those in need will not become abandoned again. For example, in Somalia the 'G' word has been brought up for atrocities occurring to this very day.Then there is Paul Rusesabagina, played by Don Cheadle. Simply put, Cheadle becomes his character, never going for the showy theatrical bits that will look good in a 30-second clip. Rather, he embodies the spirit of a true honest-to-God hero. The actual Rusesabagina helped on the set of Hotel Rwanda, and the touch of honesty that would have come from the real Paul is evident on screen and in Cheadle's presentation. Ultimately, Rusesabagina is a name as worthy as Oskar Schindler.Ignoring the built in power of the subject matter, though, Hotel Rwanda is a work of cinema and art on its own merits too. I first began to realize I was in for more than a Discovery channel special in an early scene before the genocide, as lightening brightens the sky at intermittent points. It is a brilliant way to foreshadow the coming storm Rwanda is about to face. Rusesabagina himself is a Hutu, but his wife and many of his friends are Tutsi, and as Rusesabagina and some friends are talking about the looming danger on the horizon as Tutsi members have become verbal targets thanks to a local radio station's spreading of propaganda, the brilliant touch of the lightening that is not overused but rather subtly inserted into the background helps create a sense of unease.Ultimately, this is a film that needs to be seen. The Oscar nominations come out tomorrow, January 25th, and I hope this film picks up several nods partly to help it gain more attention in a way the actual event never really did. The film is as powerful as Schindler's List but still unique in its own right, helping to illuminate a terrifying but little known event. Hotel Rwanda is testament that there is always a reason to stand up against humanity's greatest flaws, and that those who turn their backs can be just as dangerous as the ones who carry the bloody machetes down into their local neighborhoods.",8,3,4,12 February 2005
The Bourne Ultimatum," I'll avoid saying anything silly like 'The Ultimate Bourne!'
","In this film Bourne chases and is chased, and sometimes both happen at the same time. It all becomes twisted yet it never loses a basic simplicity that keeps us involved.There are some great additions to the cast, including Albert Finney, Scott Glenn and David Strathairn (he was Edward R. Murrow in Good Night, and Good Luck.) The acting has been strong in the entire series, and it's great to see the 'evil higher-ups' not spitting and screaming at each other but talking calmly and realistically, their menace more believable. Then when they do yell, it actually means something.There is also a great twist that puts this movie into chronological perspective with the second film.It is further proof of great directing and writing that the same scene with the same dialogue can have two completely different emotional meanings when spun in different ways. Really connecting this film to The Bourne Supremacy, this further stressed that this is one story told over multiple films. It does that trick better than many sequels nowadays shot back-to-back.Also, Bourne's connection to a character with a small role in the previous two films is given new meaning that easily could have become silly and cliché. Instead, it really works and actually gives an extra layer of substance to Bourne and to the people helping him on his dangerous journey to self-discovery.That's why the film works, because it has real characters who aren't idiots.Still, the action does not disappoint.In fact, what makes the action so successful is that there is a sense that it is captured rather than created.I'd say the style most reminds me of the television show The Shield, which also uses a lot of hand-held camera work and zooms, sometimes shifting out of focus as if it were documenting real events unraveling at breakneck speed before an audience.It's a style that has gotten Greengrass notice since his 2002 film Bloody Sunday.It's also a style that could get tiresome, but Greengrass doesn't keep everything at '11.' Although the hand-held is a constant, there are different degrees to how the shots are framed and, especially, how they are edited together. There is a dramatic curve to the writing, directing, and editing, which creates room for slower scenes that aren't about running around on roof tops.The second film got a lot of complaints for its use of 'shaky cam.' It never bothered me that much, but I do think Greengrass has gotten better at his style. He perfected it with last years United 93.He brings what he has learned to the table here. Even a few shots in The Bourne Ultimatum are completely breathtaking and memorable. One involves a dive into a river, and another is that money-shot from all the trailers of Bourne as he jumps in mid-air through a window. And you can feel the crunch of the metal against the hard road in the New York City car chase.Yet, the directing is never about just one shot but about how they all connect together. I think this is what helps Paul Greengrass stand out as a director, as in some ways he is almost like a modern (and non-communist) Sergei Eisenstein.The editors know exactly how to cut the shots together in a rhythmic, almost musical way.One example involves a codeword which we see on a computer screen. At a different location, a character answers when asked for the codeword but does not give the same one. You're confused for a split-second, and then back on the screen another word is revealed with a different meaning.This all happens in about three seconds, and the entire film is directed and edited with this care, always keeping a sense of mystery and spontaneity. When characters make choices, we feel there are literally making those decisions on screen.And the credit really goes to everyone who made this film.The music is fantastic, and the best in the series. It really sets the mood without devolving into cliché, and there is some surprising orchestral work.The writing especially stands out for delivering a script that escapes a lot of its genre confines. In a way The Bourne Ultimatum becomes the ultimate character driven action film.The flashback scenes are a bit too formula 'streaky lights' and 'jerky slow motion.' I think it would have been more original and effective if a different film stock were used, perhaps 16mm with a different range of colors to more subtly reveal these important moments. Some very important moments happen during the flashbacks, too.Also, after one particular crash Jason Bourne only has a few bruises on his face. Although in all the movies there are unrealistic moments, everything is still fairly grounded to Earth. This one has the most 'superman' elements of any of them, and though the majority of it all fits for the filmic world created it would have been nice to see him a bit more beat up at the end, kinda like how he was bloodied and limping at the end of The Bourne Supremacy.Furthermore, one could argue that the revelations behind Bourne's past aren't exactly earth shattering, but the series as a whole has always been more about the journey than the destination. I would argue, as well, that the real twists are more character based than narrative based.With these minor details aside, this is easily the best action film of 2007.The Bourne Ultimatum will help solidify the Bourne trilogy as being one of the big movie surprises in recent memory. Who would have guessed five years ago that Jason Bourne would become one of the defining action heroes of the decade, like James Bond of the 60's, John McClane of the 80's and Jack Ryan of the 90's.",8,1,2,6 August 2007
The Aviator," Scorsese doesn't disappoint
","The tagline proudly exclaims, 'Some men dream of the future. He built it.' It is not a lie. The name Howard Hughes is one probably known best by older generations, but the new biopic from Martin Scorsese (Taxi Driver, Goodfellas) may change all that. Clocking in at nearly three hours, not a minute is wasted as the admittedly quite amazing and very vivid life of Hughes is explored, both in the most public of his accomplishments and the most personal of his demons. Reminiscent of another famous biopic, Citizen Kane, it begins with Hughes as a boy, being warned of germs by his mother. His obsessive-compulsive disorder and phobia of germs would later take a much more central role in his life as he would grow.Then, the story jumps right into the production of Hell's Angels. Only 21, the already rich Hughes (his father was an inventor) is directing his first film, a World War I epic. At one point, in order to get the camera shots he wants, dozens of fighter planes are whisked off into the air, with Hughes in one. It is the first aerial sequence of the film, and as Hughes stands up with his portable camera in hand in his flying vintage plane, a love for both aviation and film-making is evident, and it is a great ode to not only Howard Hughes but to all those who will risk everything for what they love to do. It is also Scorsese winking at his own heroes, and perhaps his own generation, too.The film spans from the roaring 20s to the war torn 40s, and each age is recounted in vivid detail. The 20s in are particularly amazing, as singers croon to vast crowds of bygone partiers and Hollywood elite. It is almost as if the film were an actual time-capsule, capturing images that are not only recreated but authentic. Still, the story never becomes bogged down by the huge budget or grand visuals, and Hughes life only becomes more complex as the film continues. It is only in the last hour, really, that the film stumbles at all, as The Aviator ventures into the already much traveled territory of a biopic: the court battle. Here, lead by an appropriately repulsive Alan Alda as Senator Ralph Owen Brewster, Hughes is attacked by a corrupt system for, ironically, charges of corruption.That's not to say any interest is lost, though, and if the greatest complaint of a film is that it is only the best at something that has been done before rather than good at something startling new, then it is not too severe of a complaint at all. In fact, some of what transpires within these hearings is enough to inspire an urge to find the actual old news reels of the genuine Howard Hughes hearings and to see every last detail of what was actually said. That is a great strength of the film overall, as everything it shows is just enough to give depth to the human character of Hughes while also enough to beckon one to seek out more long after the film is over. Hughes is a fascinating person, really, framed by a fascinating movie.",8,0,0,12 February 2005
Jarhead," Full Metal Jarhead
","For both better and for worse Jarhead, the new film based on a 2003 best-selling book by former marine Anthony Swofford, is not just another war film.That is not to say it doesn't share any similarities.Like many recent films about war Jarhead tries its best to become immersed in the feeling of military life. From the locations to the sounds, everything is authentic. Important is the acting which never becomes theatrical as the performances strive to echo true marines.Jake Gyllenhaal especially shines as Swoff, able to give a surprisingly subtle performance that never really cries out, 'look how brilliant and intense I am!' The entire film is really quite subtle in this way and this lends to an overall uneasy feel that Jarhead lets unquestionably sink deep.Also, director Sam Mendes crafts stunning images in only his third film (he previously made the award winning American Beauty and then Road to Perdition with Tom Hanks), as burning oil fields and sun-bleached sand dunes are displayed in full glory.Jarhead even strays into narrative territory that has already been explored before. It begins much like Full Metal Jacket with a yelling and almost comically abusive drill sergeant proving the horrors of boot camp. In turn, the marines slowly become more and more eager to shoot something.However, such similarities in turn compliment the ways Jarhead is actually a commentary on these perceptions of war. It is, ultimately, quite unique.Unlike 'classic war films,' such as Saving Private Ryan or Apocalypse Now, Jarhead is more about what happens when the intensity of battle never really comes. All the marines in the film are pumped up for battle, at one point actually watching Apocalypse Now and cheering as helicopters blow up targets.Yet they never get this same opportunity.As an audience member I found myself waiting for that big battle scene but it never really comes. And it never should.You see, this is not a film for those seeking mindless action. Jarhead isn't afraid to scrutinize the bloodlust that can fill both war and people and it shows the need for this bloodlust to be quenched, whatever the cost.It questions the perceptions of war that have pervaded our culture, asking if it is death and destruction that truly defines what war is.With this said, some problems do arise with the film.There is always a distance kept from the characters. We see that they are bored and that problems such as endless waiting and cheating spouses are their greatest adversaries.Yet the characters never grow or change. Simply showing them as anxious to fight is not enough to fill up two hours.Especially as some horrors of war finally begin to trickle in, such as the aftermath of a massacre in the desert, we never see the effect on the battle-ready mentality of the soldiers beyond some immediate outward emotions.At the end of the war are the marines any different than when they went into it and why? What happens to all the anxiety built up within them? Jarhead never really attempts to answer any of these questions.It is also somewhat ironic that this is a film released in the midst of the second war in Iraq because the war of today is a much different beast than the Gulf War. In this current war there isn't a problem of not having enough 'action.' Likely this new Iraq war is the battle that the soldiers of Jarhead yearned for while waiting in that desert.The makers of Jarhead claim that they do not have any direct commentary on the new Iraq war and the film echoes this. This stress for objectivity sadly cripples some of the lasting power, though.By delving into the ultimate results of the Gulf War on its restless troops perhaps certain truths of today could have become illuminated.Jarhead mentions that, 'All wars are different, all wars are the same.' It is this simple yet paradoxically complicated message that best defines Jarhead while also keeping it from becoming all that it could have been.Critic's Conclusion: Don't expect much action from Jarhead, a movie that focuses on how boredom and tedium can be dangerous weapons in warfare as well. Overall it is a fairly unique and thought-provoking film full of unforgettable images, though at the end there is a sense that Jarhead doesn't reach the full potential of its themes and images.",7,1,3,5 November 2005
Batman Begins," The Bat is Back!
","Batman BeginsDir. Christopher Nolan Starring: Christian Bale, Katie Holmes, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson, Ken Watanabe, Rutger Hauer and Cillian Murphy Rating: PG-13 for intense action violence, disturbing images and some thematic elements. Length: 141 minutes Rating: ****1/2 (Four and a half stars out of five)In the summer of 1989 history was made as director Tim Burton transformed one of the most popular comics of all time into one of the most popular films of the time, unleashing a dark and epic blockbuster that helped define a style. A franchise was begun, and its name was Batman.Then, in the summer of 1997 history was again made. Batman & Robin opened, a film that achieved the rare feat of almost single-handedly stopping a hit franchise dead in its tracks. To some it is even considered to be one of the worst mainstream films of all time, and such claims are not without merit. Boy did Batman & Robin kill, bury and then utterly destroy and blast into oblivion whatever respect the name 'Batman' carried, at least when it came to the silver screen. So is it even possible, or reasonable, to bring back a franchise many would consider best left dead?Well, with a film as good as Batman Begins it is.Perhaps the best of the bunch in the recent explosion of comic book movies, the first thing that Batman Begins has going for it is the talent. Loaded with big names, from director Christopher Nolan (the man behind Memento, the 2000 indie hit that messed with time and psychology) to a cast featuring just about everybody on the planet, everything bristles with energy, veracity and most importantly purpose.Still, it takes more than big names to make a film good. There are no worries, though, as director Nolan is able to take all the money and opportunity thrown at him and mold potential into perfection. Or close to it, at least. Although a summer 'event' film, there is much depth to be found amongst the explosions and car chases, and the film carries an emotional weight that few blockbusters care to bother with.Now, besides the luggage Batman Begins carries in the world of Hollywood, it also has a lot to explain when it comes to the events in a little place called Gotham. Several villains, including Scarecrow and Ra's Al Ghul populate this new Gotham, which itself no longer appears either goth or camp. Rather, Nolan's Gotham most resembles a real city.Then there's more characters in the form of a love interest played by Katie Holmes (don't tell Tom Cruise), and all the usual suspects such as the butler Alfred and the tech-guru Lucius Fox. Adding to an already full plate is a host of corrupt executives and seedy crime lords. And then of course there's Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne, or is it Batman? And make no mistake, this is his film.So yes, no doubt about it, Batman Begins is a busy film. Yet it never becomes a chore. Despite all the different characters and themes, the film enjoys connecting all the dots, and rather than breezing through the exposition to get to the good stuff it takes its time.Of course, the 'good stuff' is still there. Namely, action! And of course the action does not disappoint. Not overused and always purposeful, i.e. never action for actions sake, it help keeps the film on the right track, towards class and not camp.Ultimately, though, this is a film that really isn't just about derailed trains and twirling police cars, and it is this determination to do more than offer pleasant eye candy that helps Batman Begins avoid the disposable nature of many films in its class (for an example just move over to the next theatre where Mr. and Mrs. Smith is likely playing.) This Batman is about the characters and what drives them, with most of them fleshed out beyond the simple black and white stereotypes of 'good' and 'evil.' The only main complaint that jumps out comes near the end, where it seems a scene is completely left out. Part of downtown Gotham is in ruins, many are most likely dead or at least injured, and yet hardly any mention of this is made after the fact. However, it's a small nitpick, and Batman Begins ends on the same high-note it began with. As a sequel is hinted at, likely to feature Batman's most famous foe, a surprisingly high amount of anticipation is created as it becomes clear that the last words likely to go through the minds of moviegoers all about will be, 'chill out.'",8,1,2,15 June 2005
28 Days Later...," astonishing
","I'll keep this short but sweet. This film is excellent. It has flaws. And while it's frame may not be original, it is full of images and ideas I haven't seen done so well before. Better than Dawn of the Dead, and although it may not be a fully 'enjoyable' film, it is a landmark, sure to be not just a cult classic but a classic, and I'm glad it's done so well. Utter garbage? That's Charlie's Angels 22: More T & A my friend.",7,0,0,6 July 2003
Lawrence of Arabia," Why this film is brilliant, and it's not because of 70mm
","Note: I talk about scenes in the film so there are MILD spoilers.Yes, Lawrence of Arabia is remembered for desert vistas and sweeping battle scenes. The cinematography is unforgettable, the scale vast. In many ways, it defines 'epic,' but at the center of Lawrence of Arabia there is a real historical person who was also a hero worthy of classical Greek tragedies: a man whose virtues are his downfall. A lot of people seem to miss this, and often I think fans of the movie even miss quite why there is nothing else out there like it. Every aspect of the film, from the narrative structure to the staging of shots, revolves around exploring not just what T.E. Lawrence did but why he did it, and what it cost him.The desert is a recurring image, but it's not simply a stunning landscape. Shots linger on vast emptiness, and suggest a blank canvas on which Lawrence can paint whatever he wishes. Profoundly alienated from his family and home culture, Lawrence pulls on the robes and persona of the man he might have been, if he'd been born an Arab. The deeper his insecurities reach, the farther his ambitions must go. He conquers the desert, and the desert conquers him, demanding payment for every personal triumph.The desert and the visuals of Lawrence of Arabia work in relation to the narrative, characters and themes in a way that would be impossible without 70mm film, without the long, lingering shots that make the desert itself a character. The desert shifts and changes, shimmers and conceals, as mysterious and indefinable as Lawrence himself. Peter O'Toole's performance is mirage-like, with emotions flickering and disappearing. Just as some shots linger on a vast and empty desert, others linger on his face, frozen in a moment of internal conflict.Director David Lean cuts together close-ups and wide-angle shots to reflect the dual nature of his film as vast epic and intimate portrait, as when Lawrence journeys through the furnace heat of the desert to rescue a lost man. Consider the sequence. A speck in the distance; Lawrence's eyes, lit up in relief and vindication; the man, who has expected to die, almost literally rising from the dead; they move toward each other, two specks becoming one; and finally: the impersonal specks become human beings again.Robert Bolt's screenplay is elegantly structured to show that the desert exacts a personal price for every public triumph, and that Lawrence's inner and outer identity are constantly in conflict. Lawrence captures a Turkish seaport by crossing the Nefud desert, but this success has required him to execute the very man whose life he just saved from the desert. Returning to Cairo to announce his military triumph, he helplessly watches a young friend drown in quicksand. Grieving and stunned, Lawrence approaches the Suez Canal and is seen by a British motorcyclist. To this man, Lawrence is a speck on the horizon, and when he calls, 'Who are you?' we know this is the very question Lawrence is asking himself. The more Lawrence accomplishes, the more of a stranger he becomes to himself -- an unknown speck in the desert within.Eventually Lawrence must come in from the desert, and rejoin his own race-and-class divided culture. This time, Bolt hides the theme of identity in a way that can only be noticed when the film is seen more than once. At the end of the war, and the movie, a British officer shouts racist insults and slaps Lawrence down to the ground because he is dressed in Arab garb. A few days later, when Lawrence is wearing a British uniform, this same officer is proud to shake Lawrence's hand.Still later -- but seen at the opening of the film, at Lawrence's funeral -- this very British officer professes his great respect for Lawrence and berates a reporter, who really did spend time with Lawrence, for daring to be cynical about him. And the theme of identity comes full circle. Much as Lawrence fought for ideals his own people did not understand and against personal conflicts few would see, Lawrence of Arabia remains a film of many secrets, offering something new to discover on each viewing. It is the dual nature of Lawrence of Arabia, as an epic and as a personal exploration of the mind, that lifts it to a level of poetry made from images and dreams.Ironic that the film is like its hero: often celebrated but rarely understood.",10,16,21,22 January 2008
JFK," Why I think this film is brilliant
","I don't know how much Oliver Stone believed what he showed in this film, but from his claims it's quite a bit. Yet, to me, that's really beside the point, especially since no one with any self respect should ever take any single source as gospel. This film is great because it's not just ABOUT a conspiracy, but it's about why conspiracy's are so fascinating, and why people like to believe in them. The simple answer is they make great stories. I mean, pretend for a second that JFK was a fictional film... exact same film, except nothing was based on actual people. It'd be rightly seen as a brilliant thriller full of plot twist after plot twist.There's also a lot of black humor in the film I think people miss as they huff and puff about this and that. Personally, do I believe JFK's death was done by the US government as an internal coup from one ideology to another to help jumpstart the Vietnam war and also help line the pockets of companies that build military equipment? No... but it makes a great story. And I find it easier to watch this kinda story, too, when the 'official' story makes no sense. Obviously something was going on. The most reasonable 'theories' usually deal with some mob connections and a small but powerful group of people behind the assassination. Not a massive governmental conspiracy, but also not just one lone guy. But JFK goes beyond that as a film, and it really represents to me WHY conspiracy theories are so attractive (and why, when things don't add up, we automatically start connecting the dots in the most extreme ways. Foul play may be involved, but not to the level we sometimes wish it was involved).There's one other film that does this.... Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. Another film where people try to claim it's outing the Illuminati or whatever, but that's really not the point of the film at all. In Eyes Wide Shut, we see a man who has lost the passion for life because there is no conflict in his life, so he goes looking for it. It parallels human's need for excitement and challenge with the same needs in marriage and sex, but JFK and EWS go together for me as two sides of the same coin. Different tones and structure, but both are about - beyond everything else - why the idea of conspiracies are attractive, and ultimately, why storytelling can be such a powerful force. Because after all, in the end all a conspiracy theory is is, well, a tall tale.",9,1,9,5 April 2011
X-Men: The Last Stand," average, and disappointing. why all the love?
","THERE ARE SPOILERS, SO BEWARE! This is not so much a full fledged review like some of my other stuff, but just some thoughts that depict how bad parts of X-3 were.In fact, the more I think about it, the more I really dislike X-3.It was disappointing. No time for characters, lame melodrama, lame deaths with no emotional impact, and action that at times looked waaayyy too CG. I'd give it a C+ or C. This summer has been pretty lame, so far, with Poseidon being the worst.And why DID WOLVERINE KILL Jean??? couldn't he have stuck her with the cure? and at the end... nothing is fixed. what humans and mutants suddenly 'get along' because of one battle? and they didn't do anything with Wolverine, what about his past, what about the arc for that? people are like... SHUT THE F UP, SURE RATNER CAN'T DO CHARACTERS AND STORY ARCS, BUT HE DOES EVERYTHING ELSE FINE AND I THINK IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS MOVIE YOU LOSE YOUR CRED. Okay, except, I was really looking forward to this, I like Red Dragon and the Rush Hour movies. But wtf... bad writing, bad directing, even rushed effects. How was this 'good?' I've never read the comics, but this betrayed the other 2 movies, and that matters. Overall very, very disappointing, and I dislike it the more I think about it. And also, the scene with Golden Gate did go to night too quickly. I found that really funny... the sun is setting, and suddenly, it's night. ONE SINGLE INSERT of the sun setting would have made that make sense, but instead... it was just funny. And the action had no rhythm, a lot of it was just movement on screen. And, I'm the Juggernaut bitch? Comeon.... seriously.Another problem is that I never felt like a war was about to happen... there was never a sense of excitement, or doom, or that beyond the specific images I was seeing something was HAPPENING and going on. That is perhaps the biggest flaw, it never drew me in. The best films make you feel as if you are seeing just part of a world, that beyond what is shown things are happening and the world and characters are changing. The other X-Men films at least somewhat got this down, but The Last Stand... nothing. And that is the sign of a competent but not really talented director. Creating that feeling, along with creating real emotion.... that's what a genuine director can do. Ratner is simply competent; his film isn't unwatchable, but it's got nothing extra to it to make it last. It's almost as if it were directed by a robot.and Magneto, his character was very inconsistent. i didn't for a second buy his betrayal of Mystique, partly because there was no reaction, no sense of loss, it all happened so fast. very, very lame. Ian McKellan can only do so much with a terrible script...And the end of the credits is overrated... it's only about 20 seconds.",5,1,2,26 May 2006
Lincoln," Talkie, one-dimensional, over simplified, but great performances!
","The film was originally pitched as showing Lincoln, warts and all, rather than as an untouchable icon. That's what I wanted to see. I think Lincoln was a great President, but there's no way around it, he was still a man of his time, and no president is without blemish. Slavery was not just a moral issue, it was an economic issue. It'd be like making a movie 100 years from now about bin Laden and the whole reason we went to war with him was because he was anti-woman rights. I mean, he is, but that's just a fraction of the picture.The Civil War was NOT just about the morality of slavery, as this film mostly shows. Lincoln himself, to his dying day, believed that the two cultures could never truly live together, and he had thought about 'transporting' all the slaves back to Africa. He made racist jokes and for the majority of his term as president (arguably all of it) his main goal was to keep the country together, not to establish a moral precedent on how to handle slavery and racism. The 13th amendment was a way to try and avoid the same conflict sprouting up again, since the various 'compromises' over the years had all horribly failed. Oh, that's another thing, this film shouldn't be called Lincoln, it should be called The 13th Amendment. We only see the very end of Lincoln's presidency, let alone anything before he was president, and the film has very little going on psychologically like the truly great biopics such as Lawrence of Arabia or even Raging Bull.Lincoln also did some very controversial things. He suspended habeas corpus, which is mentioned once in the film by one of the clear villains of the film and never brought up again. That's vital to understanding how he approached the civil war. People were arrested without trial for saying negative things about the country. Do the ends justify the means? It's a good question to ask, and it'd make for a good film. Lincoln seemed to want to ignore this as a film and mostly focus on the moral dilemma of slavery, which is an aspect of history, but not the whole truth, especially since the film begins with slavery as a moral debate and doesn't grow into it.Admittedly, the first 15 minutes of Lincoln were the best in my mind (including his dream - which to me worked better as an idea for being President than the 13th amendment specifically, in that when you're a leader, things are moving forward whether you want them to or not). I'm not saying any of this to disparage Lincoln, it's to show what the conflicts of that era were. As I said, imagine a film made 100 years from now that is all about bin Laden's stance on women, or America's stance on global warming as if that were the single biggest thing on people's minds during this recession. It's an issue, but it's just one aspect of a much bigger picture. However while my problems with the film were related to the narrative, I thought all the performances were incredible, especially Daniel Day-Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones, who has the best and most historically accurate and complex character in the film. Thaddeus Stevens really did see slavery as a moral issue, and he was a big influence on what happened in the 1860s.Of course, there was another hundred brutal and oppressive years after the civil war before the civil rights movement in the 1960s. Brutality and segregation lived strong in a very institutionalized manner and all the extreme racists loved Lincoln because, until our recent era, he was not seen as the anti-racism president but as the president who kept America together. And that's still, ultimately, his true legacy, and because of his strengths as president now a lot of credit is given to him that really should be saved for other figures who are more obscure but who did the real legwork for equality both before and after the civil war.It is disappointing to me that Americans have gobbled this film up so happily, because it really is a lie in many ways, and it's also not that entertaining of a film, nor does it question the very nature of truth like, say, David Fincher's Zodiac.",5,0,2,12 February 2013
Million Dollar Baby," Better than a million bucks
","Honestly, there was little doubt that this film would be good. With the actors, the director the talent, it was a sure hit. And yet, it still somehow exceeds expectations. First and foremost, Million Dollar Baby is not a boxing film. Yes, boxing is in it. There are boxing matches. Many of the characters are connected because of boxing. But through this the film reaches for so much more than simply telling the story of a boxer and her trainer. Instead, the film ultimately tackles issues of faith, love, life, fate, will, strength and ultimately asks one of the greatest questions of all: what does it mean to live? That's not to say there aren't any cliché's in the film. As hopeful Maggie Fitzgerald goes against all odds to reach her dream of fighting for the world championship there is a hint of familiarity in her efforts that comes in the form of Rocky or real life boxer Jake La Motta (spotlighted in Raging Bull.) Yet, for every cliché there is an original element wholly unique to this story.Moreover, the characters become real. Eastwood's Frankie Dunn begins as a grumpy, old man who wishes not to train Maggie because she is both a girl and too old. Hmm where has this been seen before? But then, it does not end there, and the journey Frankie as well as the rest of the characters face does not lead to familiar territory but rather to a myriad of difficult questions, leaving the viewer with no easy answers. This film does not end with everything tied up in a neat little bow.What Million Dollar Baby does do, though, is leave an impact. Seldom becoming manipulative and always holding a quiet grace, much like in both of Eastwood's previous films Unforgiven and Mystic River, it takes ideas used before and breathes new life into them. The style Eastwood directs with is unmistakable and the emotion he creates unforgettable.Then there is the ending. Recently much controversy has come from some of the choices made by characters at the end of the film, with political commentators condemning the film (Rush Limbaugh is a big example) and some major published reviews even spoiling the end of the film because of its supposed 'political ambitions.' It's unfortunate, and the hubbub is completely silly. Eastwood has said himself that he meant the film as a story, not a quick answer to a political problem of today. Sometimes the characters an actor will play or the story a director will tell aren't necessarily their point of view. That's why acting is called acting; a character is created. A story is told to transport as well as reflect.Furthermore, much of these complaints likely come from people who haven't even seen the film (it's sadly reminiscent of the butchering Martin Scorsese received for his work The Last Temptation of Christ.) Even more ironic is the fact that the very viewpoints of the attackers of this film are brought up and questioned within the narrative itself. Overall, it's best to see Million Dollar Baby without any knowledge of the ending or even the major plot points, and to instead let the film tell its story. This is art, subtle but never compromising, an example of Eastwood at his best and of cinema at it's finest.",9,8,13,12 February 2005
Eyes Wide Shut," Incredible... more layers each time I see it
","I love movies that have a basic story that you can follow, a basic narrative that isn't just completely random, but that when you look at it deeper, you see that it really is about something much different, and that the apparent thematic material and story are really clever disguises for something much more complex and interesting. The real meaning is there but you have to dig to find it. There is still something on the surface but it hides the real material, like skin covering the real meat and skeleton.Now, I've been doing some reading about the cult and the Illumanti and all that and Kubrick's death and how it all relates. Let me first say that I completely agree that Eyes Wide Shut isn't REALLY about sexual exploration and the relationship of a couple who are having marriage issues. These are themes that have been explored way before EWS came out, and many critics jumped on the movie for not being original like most Kubrick films and beating a dead horse that had already been cinematically explored. But I think Kubrick was more intelligent than that. However, many conspiracy theorists jump on the fact that EWS is really all about cults (certainly ironic considering Cruise and Kidman's scientology ties) and how evil they are, and especially about how the Illumanti control the world and we are blind to it, with some even saying that EWS is Kubrick's warning of a new dark age to come. And blah blah blah.Me, I see the film as actually a deep complex study on our fascination with cults and conspiracy theories as a whole, and of the unknown. It is inherint that there is something creepy about what we don't understand. The mysterious is never boring. I think a lot of people attribute stuff (say, 9/11 for example) to crazy theories because a) it makes everything seem more interesting and b) because it means responsibility is never in your own hands. This works with EWS very well I think. Firstly, Cruise and Kidman are portrayed as the 'vanilla American' couple getting bored with life and each other. Again, many conspiracy theories are made by people bored with their own lives that want excitement in believing that there is a BIGGER PICTURE out there and that they are one of the lucky few to really see what is happening, while everyone else is 'sheep.' This also fits in with Cruise's intent interest to go to the party he is told about that he knows is VERY exclusive. It is exciting and different, and it is something most people don't know about.But then, secondly, is the fact that Cruise doesn't have to really take responsibility for his actions. He had drawn away from his wife, and was willing to cheat on her, but then the 'cult' threatens his life and suddenly the issue of infidelity is MINOR when compared to the grand tragedy and mystery that he came upon. This can very much be symbolic of why such organizations have their powerfullness and mystery trumped up, and why conspiracy theories are so popular. It takes away the importance of our own actions in the big scheme of things. They can be the invisible scape goat we point to when we make our own mistakes. It's a way to gauge your own sins against far greater sins and to find absolution in this fact.Even the title, EYES WIDE SHUT, fits in this paradox. People make themselves believe they have a greater view on life than all others while really they are the most blind themselves. The ones who think 'they get it' and that everyone else is sheep are only fooling their own hearts.I see the sun worshipping 'cult' as a tool to further these themes and the journey the main character takes through both reality and fantasy, ego and anonymity. The real trick to it, and the trick to most of Kubrick's film, is that they are never about what you think they are about. If the film says one thing, it really means another.To me a big theme of Eyes Wide Shut is responsibility, and the importance of our own actions as OUR actions (and the contrast between your actions being part of a larger sum and belonging to you on an individual level.) The blurred line between the real and the unreal, between boring old life and the fantasy of our dreams, is also very important as well for this film, especially in the fact that sometimes we want - and need - that line to be blurred. To discover more about ourselves and who we really are, and also to discover more about life and the experiences and sensations it can offer, we can find ourselves searching out dangerous roads. These confusing paths can lead many places. They can lead to a reality where up is down, where the blind see more than anyone else, and where those who appear enlightened actually are the most sightless of all. So to speak, this is a journey where you can take each step with your eyes wide shut.",9,2,4,14 June 2007
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," it coulda been better... shockingly better!
","Beware Potter fans for I am about to speak utter blasphemy: I was bitterly disappointed with Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.Okay, so I'll be fair, it is not that bad of a film. However, after already three films in this franchise some things begin to get too annoying to ignore.For example, why is it that in every Potter film all the most important story points happen in a dingy room with Harry talking to some evil character we thought was on his side but was really evil all along, or vice-versa? And why is this always interrupted at just the right moment by the forces of the good guys? Also infuriating is that a lot of the minor characters are one-dimensional cardboard cutouts that take away from the impression that the Harry Potter universe is a fully magical world with living, breathing inhabitants.For example, there is the Daily Prophet writer Rita Skeeter who is pretty much the same exact annoying character as Gilderoy Lockhart from the second film. She is a sensationalist liar full of her own arrogance.Most of the villains of Harry Potter are just as shallow, too, fitting the old stereotype of evil being ugly and good being attractive.Also, it has been said before but I will repeat it again: a film must stand on its own.This particularly crippled Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban with the scene in the Shrieking Shack, as a lot of plot points were brushed over and everything became very unclear. Here the problem lies more in many of the little details that are vague or never explained.For an epic film some of the spectacle is ignored, too.Near the beginning there is a huge Quidditch match where one of the main characters, Viktor Krum, is introduced. However, as soon as the match is about to begin we are suddenly whisked away in time to the partying afterwards.Would it have killed anyone to show a little bit of the match so we could at least get a feel for how great a Quidditch seeker Viktor Krum is while also getting a little bit of nifty action? The biggest disappointment, though, is a case where entirely too much is shown. Now, I am treading into minor spoiler territory here so read carefully.After three movies, Voldemort is finally revealed.Here we are supposed to discover the essence of wickedness but instead we find an Oscar nominated actor in some very silly make-up. As good as Ralph Fiennes is, here he looks like an aquatic fish-man.Worse, though, is the fact that this evil villain is nothing new. He spouts nonsensically that Harry Potter will die, that he will get his power back, that his henchman are not loyal enough, that he will finish the job he began, that blah blah blah.We've heard it all before. Why are you boring me when you should be threatening me? Not everything is a missed opportunity, though.The very beginning is wonderfully creepy and Voldemort really seems threatening and mysterious (the two things he loses in his climatic appearance.) Also, the introduction of the death eaters is downright awesome and the images etched in the sky with smoke are suitably sinister and foreboding.Overall the visual style that new director Mike Newell gives this fourth outing is beautiful and memorable, and this is probably the most spectacular Potter yet.The main fault of Newell is that his pacing is somewhat clunky, as some scenes drag on too long while others are cut woefully short.Thankfully the romance between Harry and friends is not nearly as sappy or overdone as feared, though some of it comes off as a little rushed and the Goth-rock band playing at the Yule Ball seemed hilariously out of place.In the end, if you are a Potter fan you have probably already seen this blockbuster film and thoroughly enjoyed it.However, for the rest of us there might be the discovery that beneath all the pretty colors and classic themes of good and evil lays an unoriginal story cobbled together by elements of other fables in search of that extra something that could be called magic.Critic's Conclusion: Already an epic hit, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a rousing action adventure full of both spectacle and many holes. Ultimately hollow at the center despite visual beauty, the pacing is sometimes maddening and by the end it is hard not to be disappointed, at least if you're not infatuated with Harry Potter.",5,0,0,18 November 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," I'm happy to report low suckage!
","What can be said? The first two Star Wars prequels were disappointing at best. Although they made tons of cash, they just lacked everything that made Star Wars, well, Star Wars. There was little heart, charm, adventure or even real tension. With Episode III, however, the quality of the prequels takes a sharp u-turn. Revenge of the Sith is good, really good in fact.Right from the beginning it feels more like the original films than the first two artificial prequels. A space battle rages on as Anakin and Obi-Wan find themselves battling attacking starships, droids and more. It's an eye-opener, and a great way to get back into the Star Wars universe. However, this is a film that attempts to do more than just show off pretty visuals and fancy explosions. It wants to tell a story.Still, that's not to say there aren't any pretty visuals and fancy explosions. Shot on the newest of digital cams, the film is simply a marvel to look at, surpassing both prequels and, ultimately, any big blockbuster of recent memory. Cities glitter in the twilight, droids swarm vast alien marshes and lava flows from tremendous crevices. Indeed, it is rare to create artificial beauty. Fake landscapes often feel barren, but here Lucas and his animators have finally given an extra level of life to the Star Wars universe.The action too is incredible, with notable highlights including the opening space battle, a clash between Yoda and Darth Sidious in the galactic chambers (think throwing the senate booths around for some galactic Bingo), and of course the much anticipated Anakin Obi-Wan duel that takes place amongst a lava-strewn landscape of ash and fire.Oh, and Samuel Jackson gets the cool death he requested of Lucas when he first signed on to star as Jedi Master Mace Windu.But back to that 'depth' that so many recent big budget films pretend they have but really lack: yes, there is some. That's not to say this is quite the Shakespearean tragedy that some have claimed. However, there is emotion, power, and even questions are brought up that go beyond, 'I wonder how they did that double back flip into the 500 foot canyon.' Lucas has said that Revenge of the Sith is a way to analyze what good and evil are, and what can turn good-hearted people into monsters that can do horrible things. In a sense, his movie does just that.As Anakin slowly becomes Darth Vader, the internal struggle within him can be felt. To be fair, at some points it seems Anakin makes certain choices that will determine his fate a bit too quickly, but overall his descent into darkness and to the 'dark side' of the force is captured with every lurid detail lovingly displayed. The story is quite complex, as well, and some of the political underpinnings of this galaxy far, far away seem to strangely resemble those of our universe way over here. (Though the themes presented are broad and not necessarily allegorical to specific events such as the Iraq war, as one conservative group has tried to savagely point out.) So does anything not work? Of course. Few films are perfect, and as good as a film this is, especially for a summer blockbuster and a Star Wars prequel, there are still problems. The bad dialogue and hammy acting that plagued the first two prequels (and some would say the entire Star Wars franchise to a varying degree) still exists. Yet, the lameness is not nearly as abundant and most of the slower character moments work. Plus, who really goes to a Star Wars film for the Oscar winning acting? That's not to say acting isn't important, though, and for most of this third episode all the players pull off their jobs quite well.Ewan McGregor, who plays Obi-Wan, has been one of the strongest actors in all three prequels and here he continues to shine. Christensen has learned much and only a handful of his lines will now cause wincing (look for a doozy, though, once he becomes Darth Vader and finds out the fate of his beloved Padme.) Most of the supporting cast does their jobs, too, although Natalie Portman as Padme is woefully underused. Adding to the live-action cast is Yoda, who is a standout in the virtual acting department, furthering the notion that special effects can be used to animate more than buildings. Giving a much better 'performance' than in Attack of the Clones, he echoes Gollum more than Jar-Jar in the fact that his animation becomes less of a cool gimmick and more of a way to present his character.Oh, and he also can do some wicked moves.Overall, the story ends on a sad note but the series most definitely reaches a high-note. It's not perfect but ultimately Revenge of the Sith has everything Star Wars fans and movie lovers alike could want: sci-fi action, gadgets, droids, aliens, places, and even an intense story and characters battling good and evil in more than one way. The film blows past expectations, which have admittedly been lowered in the past few years. Still, there's no denying that this supposed last Star Wars film ever actually has a real soul to back up its impressive visuals, and also a sense of adventure. It's sure to be a giant hit, and it deserves it as audiences are once again whisked off to a galaxy far, far away. This time, the results may surprise you.",7,1,3,20 May 2005
Signs," Still one of my favorites
","This is the only film I've ever seen 5 times in theaters. I saw Gladiator 4 times (once while traveling overseas). Everything else has been 3 or less. More than 15 years later and it's still one of my favorites.The real reason this film works is because it's a character drama first and a thriller second. The supernatural aspects are just window dressing. Like The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, M. Night's best films work because you care about the characters and are drawn into their stories. He basically tricks audiences into eating their veggies; you're watching character dramas about human beings struggling with very real human issues. Usually those sorts of films don't exactly light up the box office. The genre supernatural stuff is just the cherry on top.With that said, it amazes me that people still lambast this film for plot holes that *aren't* actually plot holes. This film is very well thought out, and all of the little details that are put into it do in fact add up to something. I'll have to venture into spoiler territory now...***SPOILERS FOR THE SIXTH SENSE, UNBREAKABLE AND SIGNS***M. Night films are know for their twists. Yes, he's almost ventured into parody territory over the years with these surprise endings, but when they work, they work exceptionally well. Signs I think has the most subtle twist, and in many ways it is his most powerful ending.Essentially, M. Night uses genre tropes to draw you into a world, and then he flips those tropes around. So in The Sixth Sense, you think you're watching a movie about scary ghosts, and then at the end you realize you've been watching it mostly from the perspective of the ghost. In Unbreakable, you realize at the end that you've been watching a superhero origin story all along. Signs follows a similar pattern. You think it's a story about an alien invasion, but then at the end you realize you've actually been watching a movie about the apocalypse. And like Unbreakable, the film isn't really shy about letting you know what is really going on. Unbreakable has comicbooks as a major aspect of the storyline before the reveal, just as Signs has religion/faith/God as major story points before the reveal.I'm not the only person who has figured this out, mind you. You can google 'Signs demon theory' and plenty of other people point out the clues (er, signs?) throughout the film. Which brings me to my original point: water doesn't kill the aliens. There's no plot hole here. They aren't aliens. And it's not just water, it's holy water specifically that burns and kills the demon in the ending scene. Yes, you might think it's cheesy, but I think the movie earns it. You care about the characters. You care about their state of mind. The entire story builds up to this very specific moment.And just in case you aren't sold or think I'm trying to write M. Night out of a hole, keep this in mind: Bo is referred to as 'like an angel'. The water that kills the demon is her water, it's not just any water. More importantly, the TV mentions that a primitive method has been discovered in 'three Middle Eastern cities.' Last I checked, the Middle East wasn't exactly know for an abundance of water. However, it is the birthplace of the three major Abrahamic religions, and the River Jordan is even considered holy. If it was just any old water that killed the 'aliens' wouldn't a solution be found first in Seattle or Mawsynram or something?The fact that they're demons is even more obvious when you think of the fact that they look demonic (with their cloven feet, etc.) and are running around naked. Even the crop signs themselves look like a pitchfork, which is admittedly maybe a bit too much on the nose. You also never see a spaceship once. This is purposeful from a writing and directing standpoint. Lights in the sky could reference portals or gateways. It has nothing to do with interstellar space travel, that's just something the characters and audience infer before they have all of the facts. The only time the word 'alien' is actually mentioned is when they're wearing tinfoil hats. That joke isn't for nothing!Keep in mind, M. Night was raised as a Hindu himself (but went to Catholic school) and Signs in many ways plays with tropes from both Christianity and Hinduism. Think of the asuras, powerful superhuman demigods in Hinduism who are often considered 'enemies of the gods'. Wasn't there even a line in Batman v Superman about demons coming from the sky? Signs is an apocalypse story in the same way that Unbreakable is a superhero origin story or Split is an Unbreakable spinoff/sequel. You don't realize it until the end when all the pieces of the puzzle come together.So TL;DR version: Signs is a great character drama about the apocalypse (remember: apocalypse means revelation). A family struggles with grief and has to fend off demons during humanity's darkest hour. There aren't any gaping plot holes, either. Water doesn't kill aliens, but rather holy water kills demons. This film is *so much* better than dreck like Left Behind, too. If you watched Signs years ago and hated it, give it another try!",9,1,1,19 November 2019
Munich," see it before you judge it
","Unlike some recent films that found themselves surrounded amongst controversy, Steven Spielberg's new film Munich does not cripple itself with a naive message or manipulative film making.Rushed into production earlier this year, Munich could have been full of all the hallmarks of lazy film-making. Yet it shows thought, care, and passion.As a film it is able to capture the feel of the 1970's very well. Both from the clothes to the look to the feel, this is a film that never becomes a cheap modern reconstruction. Spielberg even uses 1970's cinematic techniques, such as a frequent use of zooms, to recreate a time not so long past.As a historical thriller this is a very modern film dealing with very modern issues. One person I saw it with was disgusted, calling it 'an awful piece of Palestinian propaganda.' Munich cuts to the nerve.This is exactly why it is such a towering success, especially since it is a Steven Spielberg film. Spielberg often imbues his films with mega happy endings that wrap everything into a nice little bow. Just look at the conclusion from his War of the Worlds adaptation earlier this summer.However, while Munich begins with the 1972 murder of the Israeli Olympic team and then follows the reaction afterwords (some of it of course fiction or speculation), the film ultimately transcends the entire Israeli Palestine conflict to reflect on the entire culture of terrorism begun with the Munich murders that has affected our world of today so deeply.One thing that can often cripple 'message' films like this is that they end with an overly simplistic message that can be summed up in a single sentence. Often times a film can become too much about the message and not enough about the characters, as well.Thankfully, Munich has more to say than 'all violence is bad,' or 'revenge makes us as bad as the people we are going after.' It also creates characters that are more than cardboard cutouts to be pushed through a story.Munich never tries to justify the killing of the Israeli Olympic members, either, nor does it compare the murder of the Israeli athletes to the retribution of the people part of it. In both cases blood is spilt, but it is not the same.Rather it examines the human side of such acts, observing how something that begins as a noble act of justice can quickly spiral out of control. Ironically, but sadly, often what is being fought for is quickly forgotten in the process of fighting.In the last shot, a pan revealing the World Trade Center sitting quietly shrouded in the fog of distance, Munich borders on becoming a preachy indictment of modern America.The last haunting line tempers this, though, as it does not condemn as a Michael Moore film might but rather suggests, offering something for those who know much about the Munich massacre, and for those who know nothing.Most importantly, Munich is a human story that takes all these big issues and brings them to a personal level. Sometimes in the chaos of conflict we lose sight that what we are seeing is happening to people, and being done by people, and that you cannot examine any situation without looking at the people part of it and affected by it.This does not mean that as a film Munich never stumbles, for it does. At points the hurried production time does rear its ugly head as certain scenes become muddled in unnecessary complexity. The main character of Avner, played by Eric Bana, could have had a bit better of an introduction to fully show his motives and the toll his job takes on his family.There is also a perplexing and almost amusing montage near the end at a very important moment that drowns itself in murky pretension.However, these small flaws hardly affect a film that is much more than simple 'Palestinian propaganda,' or any propaganda for that matter. In fact, the very backbone of Munich encourages individual reflection rather than blind acceptance of an ideology or moral standard.Critic's Conclusion: Munich reaches no absolutes because there can be no absolutes with such multi-faceted issues. It is this surprising complexity from Spielberg that makes this one of his best and most mature films to date, and a film that will bring him much controversy from those looking for a black and white conflict that is never portrayed.",8,0,3,3 January 2006
Sin City," Film noir for dummies... but great
","Sin CityRating: **** (Four stars out of five)Based on a graphic novel, the labor of love that is the new film Sin City exemplifies a case of style ruling over substance. But what a style it is!This style is brought to life by director's Robert Rodriguez (the guy behind the Sky Kids trilogy believe it or not), Frank Miller (the creator of the graphic novel) and special guest director Quentin Tarantino who all present an ugly world that is beautifully framed. The film is meant to be a modern type of film noir, a sub-genre of film that gained massive popularity in the golden age of Hollywood (think Humphrey Bogart in 1941's The Maltese Falcon). To bring this old style to a new audience, the visuals are perfected on the computer thanks to state-of-the-art technologies. The original graphic novel contained only black, white, and a few other solid base colors. The film helps recreate this look cinematic ally by cranking up the contrast and using bright colors that distinguish themselves clearly from the otherwise dark landscapes. It is a world that aches of the past.Make no mistake, this is a film that has been crafted and not manufactured. Every detail is lovingly placed. It is also a film that aims to sucker punch its audience in the head with violence, twists and overall absurd antics. That's not to say violence is all Sin City has to offer, though. There is romance, action, drama and even black comedy (perhaps the entire affair could be looked at as a black comedy.) The experience Sin City offers is much more alive than last fall's listless Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, another film that achieved majestic visuals through CGI.A gigantic cast helps Sin City move beyond the status of a few fanboys wet dream. With this cast three major story lines taken from the graphic novel are fleshed out, all of them evoking the sensibilities of true film noir. One involves Mickey Rourke's character Marv and his revenge scheme while another plot line follows Clive Owen's Dwight through his bloody exploits. The final story deals with framed cop John Hartigan, played by Bruce Willis. The three stories work together well as characters intersect and situations become more and more twisted.Still, Sin City is not without its flaws and at the end of the day the visuals have much more depth than anything the script has to say. With the radiance of the visuals, though, that's not necessarily a major complaint. Yet, the mostly one-dimensional characters do take away from the lasting impact of the film. The film has got more to it than many effects-laden blockbusters, but that's not saying much.Overall, film noir is a genre capable of great expression, able to tap into the inner workings of the human condition. What Sin City does is takes the most interesting aspects of this style and throws them all into a big mix. The result is a stunning experience that is filled to the brim with entertainment but also lacking in some of the subtler details that give noir its ability to strike into the darkest, deepest sections of the human soul.Critic's Conclusion: It's a bloody, violent affair full of cruel characters and broken spirits, but yet Sin City is beautiful in its bold yet simple vision. It is a film created to entertain the darker side of the human spirit, memorably appealing to the senses more than the intellect.",7,2,5,3 April 2005
V for Vendetta," Ban This Movie.... JUST KIDDING
","Perhaps better than any theatrical release from last year, this new film from the forces behind The Matrix succeeds as both enticing entertainment and as an emotive discussion starter.Taking place in the near future, V for Vendetta presents a totalitarian England where freedoms are taken away in the name of security. A man simply known as V uses tactics of terrorism to fight back at the government while also trying to stir up revolution amongst the oppressed people of his country.Then in comes the average everyday girl Evey, who soon finds herself embroiled with V and his fight.A good film works on many levels, and every aspect of the multilayered V for Vendetta succeeds.It has interesting political ideas, dealing with themes of corruption, freedom, terrorism and truth.The notion that one man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter is explored, but the complexities of such a concept are never ignored. The tragically heroic V is not meant as an example of Osama, and this is not Fahrenheit 9/11 2: Now With Masks.The script is written by the Wachowski brothers, the guys behind The Matrix trilogy, and V for Vendetta resembles the first Matrix more than its sequels.Rather than assaulting with pseudo-philosophy and overlong action sequences, this is an involving experience with a genuine story arc and characters that are both textured and real.At the beginning, it is somewhat unclear how everyone will turn out, and there is surprising tenderness and yet complexity carried throughout the story. This balance is often hard to maintain.The direction from newcomer James McTeigue is fresh, and the images brought to the screen clearly contain ambition and passion.The performances cannot be overlooked, either. Natalie Portman does a great job as Evey, but the real standout is Huge Weaving as V. Best known as Agent Smith from the Matrix trilogy, his face is always covered by a mask.He transcends these limitations, though, just as his character does. Through subtle movements and the sound of his voice, his emotions are always felt.Of course, then there is the 'C' word: controversy.While I've only heard a few voices of outrage, for anybody who does think this is simply an anti-American pro-terrorism film, I urge you to see it.Besides the fact that the source material was not written to match such beliefs (the graphic novel V for Vendetta is based on was written in the mid 90s), for as many existent parallels to modern American politics as there are, there are also differences.That's not to say this isn't a timely film, or that it doesn't deal with important issues of today.However, the 'bad guy' totalitarian government here has more in common with the Taliban or Nazi Germany than the Bush administration.V for Vendetta also has a lot of references to history and historical art, and its theme is more than a simple appraisal or condemnation of some new political practice. In many ways this is a universal story that is unlikely to age.Still, don't forget that this is entertainment, too. The action is fast paced, the dialogue sharp, and it is truly enjoyable to sit through.If controversy does sell, then at least here it is selling a great product.Critic's Conclusion: Filled with involving characters and intriguing ideas, V for Vendetta succeeds in many ways as it moves beyond controversy or political hot points to do the most important thing of all: tell a story. Few films are brilliant, but this surely comes close.",8,1,4,18 March 2006
