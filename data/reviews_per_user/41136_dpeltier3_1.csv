First Man," X15 test flight excitement, loss of 3 yr old girl Karen during Apollo preps and most exciting Lunar landing
","The movie opens with a stirring flight of the X-15 NASA test flight ,with near fatal loss of control, which Neil uses wing rocket thrusts to regain control, along with split-second decisions to avoid a mountain crash. The Apollo moon landing is thrilling, as Neil makes several decisions as the Eagle lander is running out of fuel, during constant Emergency Warnings (faulty sensor overloads) to land on empty. Any wrong decision would result in mission failure and the deaths of 3 Astronauts. This would have ended the Apollo program, or delayed it for years.
The loss of his 3yr old daughter Karen to cancer during mission preparations puts added strain on Neil and family to survive.
This is an exciting story of one man's efforts to give his all to his country, U.S.A.",10,1,1,31 May 2019
