The Blair Witch Project," i'm still in shock
","The Blair Witch project uses a kind of fear that I haven't had in a movie before.  Normally in horror films, the fear that I feel is one of shock when someone jumps out of nowhere or that of disgust when some is brutally killed.  But the Blair was not your typical horror film.  I wasn't sure I was scared until I realized that I was breathing fast and that my heart was beating fast also.  The tension just builds and builds and you feel it in you also.  The movie just grips you and that is all I can say.  Go watch it now.",10,1,2,22 July 1999
