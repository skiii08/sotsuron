Skyfall," 'Best Bond movie ever!' Really?
","I don't quite know where to start, so I'll tell you about my expectations. Casino Royale and Quantum of Sollace were two Bond movies that made Bond more human than ever and more non-gadgety, they brought him to the real world, they gave him bruises and missions that for the first time seemed hard to accomplish. So, I expected Skyfall to be THE BOND movie, the sum of everything that was good in the previous two, plus something unexpected, something that would again reinvent the franchise. These expectations were multiplied by everybody saying 'This is the best Bond movie ever made!'.The truth about this movie is that it's very poorly written and in some situations, childishly directed. I can only conclude this, when the plot of the movie includes a retired agent of the MI6 that seeking revenge blows up the MI6 headquarters making sure M is safe watching it blow up, then lets himself captured by Bond just so he can escape from the MI6, get chased by Bond in the Underground network, detonate an explosive and unleash a rogue train onto Bond when he couldn't have known Bond would chase him nor be in that very spot at that moment. I'm not finished: he then reunites with his henchmen and goes straight to a court room where he tries to kill M and doesn't stop trying until the end of the movie. The whole plan makes no sense!The movie then turns into a Scottish Home Alone starring Bond, M and Kincade. Although Bond got helped earlier in the movie by a squad of helicopters (after activating a radio signal by carefully taking the device out of his pocket, pushing the button, putting the device back into his pocket, with a close-up on the pocket so we can see what he did) now the MI6 is powerless inside the UK so everything relies on a not so in shape Bond and two old farts. Silva (the bad guy that appears in the second part of the movie, by the way) gets there by chopper with his henchmen in legionary outfits Van Damme would kill for. After some of the bad guys get killed or die in the Home Alone traps, Silva burns down the house but can then see that M and Kincade escaped through a tunnel and are now using a flashlight to get around (A FLASHLIGHT! while running for their lives).I won't spoil the ending, but I will conclude. This movie is dull, it doesn't surprise you with anything, it's more linear than a straight line, it's full of clich√©s and tacky lines, it has a gun with LEDs and sound and the technology terms and interactions are just stupid.To sum up: Daniel Craig makes a good performance, so do his colleagues, the movie is well produced (I can't forget the crappy green screen motorcycle chase in Istanbul, though), mostly well directed, the soundtrack is modest and the intro is great. They didn't screw up the Bond intro, yes.",4,34,69,1 November 2012
