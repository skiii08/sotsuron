Requiem for a Dream," Cast into a spell.
","My word, I have never felt so exhaustively assaulted after seeing afilm.  I walked home in the dizzying trance Requiem left me in.  Forweeks afterward, I was thinking about this film almost everymoment my mind was free, wondering how it had completely putme under its spell.  It is a testament to film-making whensomething so powerful can be released and grip an audience (orat least this audience member) so hard-handedly.  I found itinteresting that it was actually the sense of sound that wasassaulted the most, keeping me on edge throughout.  Withoutmuch to speak of in 2000, Requiem restores the faith in this art.",10,0,0,30 January 2001
