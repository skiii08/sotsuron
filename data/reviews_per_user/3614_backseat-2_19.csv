Deja Vu," Above Average Example of Typical Hollywood Dumb Thriller
","'Deja Vu' is a movie along the lines of 'Enemy of the State', where the basic premise is acceptable and the actors likable, but the plot depends on too much contrivance and a lazy script that insults the viewers' intelligence. Contrast this with exceptional genre films like 'In the Line of Fire', and you can see how much more memorable such a film will be when the plot is both realistic AND thrilling.While I was generally entertained by the action, I was also constantly distracted by things that just made no sense: SPOILERS***** When Denzel Washington's character is shot through the body (not just a flesh wound), he is not at all bothered by it...he is not hurting, not in shock, not inconvenienced or disabled, and not even really bleeding....are these actors and directors intelligent enough to at least add some small element of incapacitation when characters are injured like this? This reminds me of 'The Bourne Identity', where Matt Damon's character is fished out of the sea with multiple bullet wounds. All he is wearing is a foam wetsuit, yet the bullets stop just inside the skin, as if he had a steel body under the outer layer...this makes him recover immediately after the ship crew digs the slugs out of, oh, 1/2' inch deep holes...what, no punctured lungs, arteries, nerve damage, internal bleeding? What crap! One has to suspend a certain amount of credulity when viewing fictional films of this genre, but what cretins the screenwriters must think the viewers are when they come up with these amazing computer labs where only a few talented, and very young, people have such immediate access to everything. Anything the lazy script writers find convenient for the plot is suddenly possible with the wiggle of a joystick or the tapping of a few keys. I wonder where the lab is that it can be hooked to the power grid in such a way that it can cause a black out over a huge region? Must be a really big extension cord. Sorry, but a single load cannot do this...I'm in the power industry, but almost anyone can figure this out easily enough.The time warp machine has a limited radius, but it can magically fold time at a remote location over a low power headset device? Geez. We need better writers, Hollywood! That said, the dual car chase, with a car in the present chasing a car in the past was a pretty cool concept.I just got all clammy when Denzel aimed a laser pen at a flat screen monitor showing the folded-time woman in the past, and she saw it on the wall of her house. I don't care how the machine works, a monitor is a monitor and does not work backwards. Even if it was a special two way monitor designed by the creators of the lab, then it follows that the people in the past would all be standing around looking at the funny people in the lab watching them like so many zoo animals...if it is two-way, then all light would go through backwards, not just the laser pen light, for God's sake! I'm just getting started, but you get the idea.In my opinion, this movie will insult and bother intelligent, thinking viewers. Only through deliberate effort can such a viewer shut down their higher cognitive functions sufficiently for the film to be enjoyable.",6,2,5,29 November 2006
Unbreakable," Unconventional Superhero Story
","'Unbreakable' is quite a different sort of movie from the usual Hollywood fare. Since I never saw 'The Sixth Sense', I had absolutely no expectation of any kind when I walked into the theatre. Perhaps this is why I liked it better than many other people who submitted reviews to IMDB...I had nothing to compare it with. That said, I found this to be entertaining in a quiet and relatively intellectual way. There are really no action sequences, the script does not over-explain things, and the audience is required to pay attention. When it comes, the trick ending (this is no spoiler, everyone knows that this movie has  one!) makes perfect sense and also dovetails neatly (and in a 'neat' way) with the characters' identities, history and story development; it suddenly becomes logical, and even the opening comic book statistics lead up to this.As far as the spoiler goes, I don't think anybody who likes this movie would dream of hinting, or downright dropping, the punchline of the film's story. However, I think I can go so far as to say that this IS a superhero movie, in the way the classic comics developed their stories. There is a telling moment in the film where the Samuel Jackson character, Elijah, randomly hits upon the function that Bruce Willis' character, David Dunne, will have for the rest of his life. But this is not the real surprise of the movie, it is much better than that.Besides a better than average story, the way the film makers set up the scenes and used the camera is both advantageous to the story and mood, but also simply entertaining.Once again, Samuel Jackson plays the intellectual mind inside an incompatible body. He delivers his lines as nobody else can. Bruce Willis on the other hand, has few lines and mostly looks depressed. Still, it is hard to see how he could have improved the portrayal given the nature of the character. Was this a perfact movie? No. Was it worthwhile? Absolutely!",Null,0,0,24 November 2000
Memento," I really, really tried......
","I went to see Memento in a small theatre with about four other people in the whole place. We all sat quietly and paid attention. After the first 15 minutes, I thought that I had gotten the hang (sort of like when I drive in England) of it's overlapping reverse order story segments, and figured that if I could just maintain the same level of concentration, I would be able to accurately reconstruct the whole play of event in my head in the correct order, and thereby know if the opening scene was the  proper outcome. I was doing well until the last 15 minutes, when it seemed to me that the two main characters are simply out-improvising/lying & out-doubting/forgetting (respectively) each other, with no more backup information given to help the viewer decide what's what. So, I left the theatre not knowing if the 'hero' had in fact done the right thing in the first scene.However, I thought about this and NOW I wonder if that issue really mattered. Perhaps the whole point was to place the viewer in the hero's shoes (or, mind) so thoroughly that the viewer ultimately suffers the same dilemma. I simply might be unable to keep enough of the facts clear in my head for long enough to be able to separate them from the falsehoods seeded by those who wished to manipulate the hero (the same experience he would be having). If that was the film maker's intention, then this has to be one of the best movies for thinking viewers to be made in many years. If the makers intended that the viewer leave the experience knowing if the hero sorted things out correctly, then either they or I failed. But I really, really tried my best........",Null,0,2,26 June 2001
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Jedi's ignored special effect
","I, like most others, have found Return of the Jedi to be the weakest of the three original Star Wars films, albeit with wonderful strengths that mostly make up for the failings. Yes, the Ewoks are just too cute, yes Darth Vader was way too evil to be be accepted into the fold just because he comes around at the end, yes Jabba's palace scene, the monster in the pit aside, was hoaky. But, each time I see this film, two things strike me as so perfect that I forget about the rest of the movie, and it seems nobody else comments on these. First, I find John Williams music to be spectacular but somewhat derivative, but nowhere else does he shine as brightly as the background music during the scene when Luke finally goes nuts and almost kills Darth Vader. This is perfect wrought mood music (it is understated but is key to making this scene work). Second, Ian McDiarmid's performance here must be just about his best in any film, and I think certainly the best in this movie. (Ian who? He's the Emperor). A quick check of IMDB's actor list shows quite a few other movies in which I can now recall his character, such as in Dragonslayer, Gorky Park, etc; (all bit parts). But his scenes in Jedi seem to me a master stroke of really hitting the nail on the head. The postures, the movements, the facial movements behind the make-up, the voice, especially the small details of lip movement and little sneers. The eyes like a raptor's. None of this seems to be due to makeup. I can't imagine another actor who  would have done better in this role, and for me it makes the movie.",Null,0,0,9 January 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Oh, the agony!
","No, this is NOT a bad review. This is a very good review. I was in agony during the whole 3.2 hours because i knew it had to end sometime, and that I would have to wait two years to finish it. I read the LOTR after getting hooked on the Hobbit in 1970. I read LOTR every year for the next five years, but have not revisited since. Still, I have retold the story in simplified form to children since then, so my memory of the major plot details and characters is good, and I obviously love the story.I even tolerated the Saul Bass animated versions of the Hobbit and Return of the King, and actually kinda liked the Ralph Bakshi semi-animated Lord of the Rings, which covered the Fellowship of the Ring and Two Towers books (only to be finished by the Bass LOTR).I argued for years with well meaning folks who thought only Disney could do LOTR justice. I knew that Disney would only sugar coat it. I despaired that anyone would have the proper combination of patience, love for the book, skill, funding, studio support, cast, etc; to really do the job well. And I really started to dread the new live action LOTR; the trailers did look good to me at all. I did not plan to buy advance tickets or stand in line for this one.Well here I am, having just seen LOTR Fellowship for the first time, and I can only say that I cannot conceive of how they might have done a better job. As it unfolded, from the very first scene onward, I was transported to Middle Earth, and it was just the way I would have done it. the same kind of abridgements I have used to retell the story were used by the film makers, and I can understand why they did what they did.Every character was wonderfully portrayed. The locations perfect, the special effects so seamless that I was never aware of them, knowing only that they had to be there because the things I was seeing could not exist that way. Even low tech effects which made full grown human actors appear to be radically different sizes, apparently right next to each other, was jaw dropping yet at the same time quite natural. Even the soundtrack was supportive without being really noticeable.Yes, this is how I pictured Gandalf, elves, hobbits, dwarves, orcs, Gollum, etc. The cave troll on Moria was something I had never had a real picture of in my mind, but the realization here was perfect. The Balrog was even better.The final battle on the river bank, when the fellowship breaks up was straight out of the book, and as scary, exciting, sad and necessary as I imagined it. The film ended on just the right note, as did the book.I can't recommend this enough, and I can't wait for the next part in 2002.",Null,0,0,22 December 2001
Cast Away," Very good, avoids most expected pitfalls
","This was a very satisfying movie, and Tom Hanks once again shows that he is a fine choice for serious treatments of characters who are alone/isolated one way or another. I should mention that my comments wil l focus on several plot points, so SPOILER ALERT! (as if the trailers left much out.)The Setup: The movie takes planty of time to show that Hanks character is a type-A go-getter, always zipping around the world, no time for anything, addicted to his cell phone and pager. This makes the isolation and barren local of the island (good for the producers that they found a truely tiny one, as made clear from Hanks first peek from the summit) a perfect contrast. Some other user comments complained that there was not enough 'action' in the film, but teenagers apparently miss concept that it is the boredom and isolation that is the whole point. The interest comes from how he will use his native resourcefulness to cope.The Crash: there were two aircraft disasters, the storm and the explosion, and that one would have been sufficient. Obviously, the storm is required so that the crash will take place far away from where the searchers will eventually look. The explosion is required so that the plane crashes. The storm cannot account for the crash since the pilots have gone around the worst of it, as they would really do, and this film is trying to be realistic. Same with the explosion...these things DO happen, as we know from ValueJet! The crash seems pretty realistic, and the floating pieces or wreckage are consistant with real plane ditchings. My only beef is that the jet engine would almost certainly NOT still be running.The Homelife: Some have complained that the happenings back home are not shown concurrently with Hank's island vacation. The movie does it right...Hanks is the character we see the film through, and he obviously has no idea whats going on elsewhere. We find things out when he does...once again, realistic.The Unopened Package: Beside setting up the final scene, this makes some kind of sense for Hanks to leave at least one FedEx parcel alone. His whole personality is based on getting packages to their owners in a speedy and reliable manner. It was clear to me from the situation and setup of the scene that Hanks views the final package as a reason to survive. He needs to get at least one through in the end. Also, pay close attention to the scene in the beginning where the package from Texas is delivered to an obvious American in Moscow, who is cheating on his wife. Pay close attention at the end where Hanks arrives to deliver the unopened package... notice the change in the sign at the ranch. There is really very little left to doubt here.The Fed Ex Placement: According to articles, the producers wanted authenticity and a sense of reality for their film. They felt that they needed a real cargo carrier, not a made-up one. UPS said no, they don't like people thinking about packages lost in a crash. FedEx said yes, but was reportedly not paid for this nor did they pay the producers. This does not then qualify as the usual product placement that Hollywood indulges in.Overall, a well thoughout and realized movie for serious viewers.",Null,0,0,27 December 2000
The Village," A decent and atmospheric film
","I almost stayed away from The Village, since just about every review I read said it was horrible. I'm glad that I decided to give it a chance after all, and go into the theatre with an open mind and no special expectations for what it would be about (as one always SHOULD, if it were not for the often stupid, insulting, and misleading previews).The photography and atmosphere were beautiful, and by and large the acting was very good as well. Some complain about stilted dialogue or language, but when you realize who these people really are and what they are actually doing, it pretty well fits right in. It makes sense!The overall plot held together as well as any Hollywood film, although I am surprised by the number of viewers who apparently cannot comprehend such a simple plot once they have seen it, and still come up with outlandish takes on the film. Maybe they were not really paying attention or listening to the dialogue.When it all comes to a head, the twists at the end, and I counted about three places where the audience's train of thought was deliberately rerouted, are suitably explained, or at least hinted at, by what came before. And this writer/director's film's have never been really profound OR scary, after all, but they usually make some sort of sense and he has not cheated anywhere.The following might be considered by some to be a spoiler, so be warned! I think The Village is primarily a human story, a commentary on how bad our modern society has become and to what lengths people of like mind might go to find something better, and it is a romance and a tragedy. Go to it with expectations for nothing else, and you will probably enjoy it.",Null,0,0,12 August 2004
Pearl Harbor," The good and bad of it
","As a frequent filmgoer, I have seen the trailers for Pearl Harbor probably 50 times in theaters, and they predisposed me to disliking the film. Then the reviews started coming out with one-star-out-of-four ratings, and my early bird friends were saying 'good one hour movie that takes 3 hours' or 'tolerate a lousy two and a half for an excellent half hour.' So I finally went, with little enthusiasm. I was surprised that the movie seemed like about two hours, and that there were more acceptable minutes than expected; this moved it from one to two stars in my book. Still, the bad stuff is plentiful and truly awful.Some good things: Consistently excellent computer special effects, more authentic warbirds used than any other movie (at least in recent memory), a true sense of the horror of the bombing was brought to the audience, Jon Voight as Roosevelt, the fact that the film makers balanced the Japanese attack with our symbolic Doolittle Raid on Tokyo, fine Japanese actor Mako, some really convincing portrayals of Americans by quite a few British actors (these must have been requested by them, since there is hardly a shortage of American actors), Dan Aykroyd in another well done serious role, Mt. Fuji in the background of the U.S. Steel Plant in Gary, IndianaSome bad things: The very visible lines from lower lip to ears where the prosthetic chin was added to Jon Voight's much shorter one (fewer closeups would have helped...note to director; when using so much makeup, check the results before giving the go ahead for real filming!), Josh Hartnett (however, this guy would have been useful for any film where Tommy Lee Jones needs to have a flashback to his youth), repeated lack of faith by the filmmakers in the power of the historical truth (the correct number of Japanese planes, flying in correct formations, instead of the plague-of-locusts swarms they are shown buzzing around in, would have worked just as well), I know they were working with a modern carrier deck and whatever historic flying planes they could get their hands on, but let's use those computer effects to touch up the scenes (erase steam modern catapults, fill in obviously modern carrier deck shape, correct for engine and option differences in the Japanese planes), horrible and pointless and irritating and excessive slo-motion/soft focus effects, incredibly inappropriate and mood- breaking modern pop music at the end of the final scene.Most Missed Thing: One of the most important and inspiring things to come out of the attack on Pearl Harbor was the brilliant and resourceful resurrection of the harbor and some of its ships (some were refloated) in a very short period after the attack. This incredible effort helped put the USA back in the game. It was totally ignored in this movie; not even the slightest mention was made.",Null,0,0,29 May 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Legend of Drunken Master + CTHD are Must-See's
","While not a real fan of the martial arts genre, I have made a point of seeing every Jackie Chan film that has come to town, and it has come to a high point with the recent (re)release of Legend of Drunken Master...what beauty, skill, poetry in motion, plus a great story. Still, I thought what if such a film had even better production values, more superbly skilled acrobatic actors, and more gorgeous, rarely seen backdrops and locales. My wish has been answered with Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.Plenty has already been said about this great movie, apparently by others much more versed in the genre than myself. So, I will simply mention a few favorite things....Yun-Fat Chow, as the semi-mystical warrior-master type. I am not a big fan of his, and think he is rather wooden, still he gives just the right aloofness and reserve to the character. Michelle Yeoh, while not a stunning physical presence, has the mastery of moves and obvious physical strength to make her very compenent character real. Zhang Zi-Yi is stunning both for her physical beauty but obvious acrobatic grace. Chang Chen, primarily in his more playful moments in the desert, strike just the right note. And Cheng Pei-Pei is a real delight in her witch-like role...not only does she have the pedigree, but such a great face!I have been to China many times, and find most of the populous areas to be drab and wasted in appearance. So what a joy that the movie shows such beautiful vistas and sets. Every character rings with a nobility or at least strength, showing a great people at their best.I am pleased to find that the movie is really more along the lines of Chinese folklore/mythology/epic than a simple martial arts film. The twin doomed love stories plus the ancient customs and stories (sometimes only hinted at) make this so much more.The action, while not as 'real' as, for example, a Chan film, rises to a level of beauty that matches the grandeur of the story. These people are all fine physical actors, but the wire work and apparent digital cleanup (or other form of editing) is necessary. Yes, the action is not perfect, some is too shadowed, some a bit fuzzy, still that sound you hear is not just the drums...its lots of jaws dropping to the theatre floor.",Null,0,0,4 January 2001
K-19: The Widowmaker," Close but no cigar/boat
","I went to K-19 hoping for an Apollo 13 / 13 Days-type retelling of a true story, with some dramatic license but still with trust in the actual flow of events. (Hmm, maybe if this had been K-13)What the film makers delivered, however, was a decent military drama, with the usual raft of flaws one has come to expect from Hollywood. I shall mention just a few:1) Harrison Ford should have been told at the start, 'Don't bother with a fake Russian accent, nobody else on the sub is doing one either.'2) When the sub starts to crush, they should have remembered to keep it crushed for the remainder of the movie.3) Since the conflict between the two captains was (to the best of my knowledge) fabricated for the sake of the script, they should have come up with a better one. Also, Liam Neeson encourages thoughts of mutiny in his officers, but then scolds them and locks them up when they act on his encouragement. Furthermore, the repeated change of heart that Ford's captain has, regarding whether to let the crew off the sub to save their lives, just does not click with the events that are shown; his attitude flip-flops seem purely script-driven.Decent summer movie, but not a must-see.",Null,0,2,4 August 2002
Hidden Figures," Great story, delivered in TV movie style, with many silly lapses
","I had looked forward to this movie ever since hearing about it. I am a big space program buff, and delight in little-known stories being told.There may be some spoilers in what I write below, so proceed with caution!I did enjoy the movie while watching it, but was constantly taken out of the moment by the never ending stream of silly, sloppy mistakes. I have no problem with creative license and dramatizing stories for better results. But there were a LOT of real honkers throughout. I got the impression the everyone was so focused on the story that all the details went by without review or supervision.I don't plan to write a comprehensive list of all that was wrong. But I will illustrate just a few things:<ul><li>The inside of a Mercury capsule was barely larger than the astronaut. Yet the scenes inside the capsule looked like something on the accuracy level of 'Plan 9 From Outer Space'. Just throw a knob and a duct on a piece of gray plywood behind the astronaut and call it a day. And when entering the Mercury capsule, the threshold looks for all the world like it is made from a white painted window frame bought at Home Depot.</li></ul><ul><li>From day to day in the NASA parking lot, it looks like nothing changes...maybe all those engineers never moved their cars.</li></ul><ul><li>Sound effects and foley sounds throughout are often inappropriate or inaccurate, and for no good reason. I just don't think the film makers were trying in this regard. One example, the IBM computer room printer sounds like a completely different kind of printer...this is as jarring as seeing the jet in 'Airplane' with the sound of a propeller plane in the soundtrack, but unlike that movie it is not funny.</li></ul><ul><li>When John Glenn's capsule is discovered to have possible heat shield issues, that concern (which did not last long) has time to be carried to the press,distributed to the public, and there is time for all of them to get all worked up over it and fret in front of TV sets. And when the engineers are fretting over the possibly loose heat shield, the female 'computer' (the focus of the story) chimes in authoritatively with some wisdom that she almost certainly could not have known....yes she was a brilliant mathematician and knew lots of things, but was she also suddenly a materials scientist, a spacecraft engineer with expertise in heat shields and re-entry physics, who would be the only one in the room full of experts who seemed to know anything about the matter at hand?</li></ul><ul><li>Apparently nobody on the film crew knows that the heat shield is on the bottom of the capsule, not the side.</li></ul>Does this kind of thing ruin the movie? No, it does not. But if more attention had been paid these details this would have been a greater movie and not just a decent, feel-good, 'made for TV style' movie.",6,18,39,18 January 2017
Shrek 2," Funny, but a bit flat
","I watched Shrek 2 in a full theater, and all of us had a good time. This is indeed a very funny movie. So what if it does not seem as fresh and original as the first movie?There are a few points that I, after reading other reviews, want to make:1) This is not a musical, and neither was the first. The songs in both films are clearly there as parody. Remember the song that Fiona sings with the bird in the first? It's not there for it's musical value, it is there because the scene is a parody of the similar scene from Snow White. Likewise, Shrek 2 has songs which are necessary because of what the associated scene is all about; for example, if you have seen Cinderella, you know that Fairy Godmothers have to have their 'magic' song. And so on. Are the songs good, or in any way memorable? No, and I don't think they were intended to be. Probably just the opposite.2) The movie will suffer, both to older audience members, and to future audience years from now, because of the nature of it's topical references. The first movie satirized fairy tales and the movie made from them, and almost everyone knows those stories and can recognize and laugh at these references. In Shrek 2, a large percentage of references are to subjects other that fairy tales. For example, if older or future viewers don't know who Justin Timberlake is, and what his relationship is/was with a certain actress who provides a voice in this film, they are going to totally miss a funny gag. There are probably hundreds of tiny things like this scattered throughout this movie, and missing them will serious diminish it's humorous quality.3) The animation is still basically just as sloppy as that in the first film. My guess is that they have some very good people at Dreamworks, but those people are good at computer design and making the characters look good and three dimensional in a static sense. What they are missing are good ANIMATORS, those folks that design and fine tune how things move and get from point A to point B. This is where the two big computer animation studios differ; Dreamworks usually has very good stories, good actors, and good looking but poorly animated films. Pixar, on the other hand, has consistently excellent stories, good actors, and great looking and expertly animated films. It seems like every year or two, both studios come out with big movies, and Dreamworks is first to release, I will see theirs, and say wow! Then, a month or two later, Pixar comes out with theirs, done during the same time period, and I will say WOW!!!4) This movie need to be seen twice to appreciate the visual gags. There are just too many small things going on, in the corners of the frame or for very short durations, for a viewer to catch the first time around. Look for the Spinal Tap poster, the sharks and the mermaid, the Headless Horseman's sobriety test, etc.",Null,0,0,23 May 2004
Black Hawk Down," Important and yes, entertaining
","This was a very well done technical film, where just about every visual looked appropriately real and the plot development was clear. I do not consider such a tragedy to be a good subject for a traditionally 'entertaining' movie, because it hits too close to home. However, most people have no idea of the reality of pivotal events in history, and films such as Blackhawk Down serve at least to educate. In the same way that Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan educated on WWII events and Titanic brought home the horror of what would otherwise be just another sinking ship in the minds of school children, Blackhawk gives as a vantagepoint from which the folly of misguided military operations since WWII is apparent. Not since WWII has the US military had clear and competent goals and direction, with 'police actions' like Korea, fiascos like Vietnam, aborted efforts like Desert Storm, and the more recent operations being major examples, and Blackhawk shows how and why this is the case.I understand that many details such as the RPG in the chest, the retrieved hand, and so on are accurate. I wondered about the amazing stream of 'enemy' fighters, coming on in the same mindless swarm as the aliens in the movie of the same name (indeed, on a superficial level, Blackhawk has lots of features in common with that movie; replace the aliens with Somalian militia members, the space station with the city, and you have 90% of the film), yet this detail may also be factual.A very good movie, but don't expect to enjoy it.",Null,0,0,26 January 2002
The Red Violin," something for everyone
","The basically simple storyline of this film is given a fresh twist by dividing it into historical segments, and showing them intercut with contemporary shots at an auction house, where the full story is slowly revealed through scientific research, and with other shots of a fortune teller predicting the life of a young mother-to-be. What the mother does not know (and the fortune teller can't see in her cards) is that the fortune being told is actually that of a violin. How the mother's fortune got mixed up with that of a violin is revealed only at the end of the film.Samuel L. Jackson, always one for lingering facial shots that allow his remarkable ability to display subtile emotion to be fully utilized, turns in a fine performance that holds the film together, and also gives the film an extra kick as his character participates in a bit of premeditated subterfuge (how premeditated is also not apparent until the end) that gives another nice twist to the film and really helps to advance the character of the plot through the ending and beyond; the violin's story is obviously far from complete (here is where Hollywood will often screw up - they will take a film and staple the ending down so that the story has no life, but is rather obviously yet another project of an uninspired writer). Here we see that the contemporary portion of the plot is not an end but only another stage. Not profound perhaps, but compared to usual Hollywood garbage it seems profound.Throughout the film is fine music, in many styles, depicting the various persons who own the violin (kudos to Joshua Bell, the superb violinist who does all the playing where the red violin is concerned). How the violin affects them, and to a lesser degree, how they affect it, is the work of the great variety between episodes. And they are not all shaped by the same cookie cutter either. Each person is fascinating in their own right, and this would make a fine movie even without the violin (but how else to tie the episodes together so nicely?) And yet, each episode is represented in the contemporary scenes, as it is slowly revealed that the bulk of the bidders in the exclusive Montreal auction house are somehow related to the various historical characters, and wish to recapture the magic that they know once influenced their lives and fortunes.One more point; in most films where actors pretend to play instruments, it is painfully apparent that they are doing no such thing. My hat is off to the film makers for managing to portray various figures playing complicated music on the violin, in such a way that it is almost always totally convincing, and perfectly matches the sound track. Were the actors selected from expert violin players? Were special effects used? I don't know how, but it worked.This movie is a costume drama, a suspense film, a history lesson, has a great soundtrack, and no filmgoer should find themselves left out.",9,1,1,27 June 1999
The Iron Giant," How can this movie be so good?
","I went to The Iron Giant knowing nothing about it. I did not see any trailers and avoid TV (why watch the boob tube when you can spend the time at the movies?), so I knew only that it was about a giant robot. I have had a thing for giant robots since childhood, which usually results in me going to see crap like 'Robot Jox'. I am also a fan of films that satirize the '50s.The first few minutes of the film established that it was going to be a superbly animated film, if nothing else, although I've seen it twice on two different theatres so far and both time the first scenes in the small town were jerky and out of focus...luckily whatever caused this was not apparent for the remainder of the film. The first minutes up through the scary (for kids) scene at the power distribution center in the woods resulted in many younger kids in the audience screaming to leave the theatre. But then, even they were caught up and were very quiet for the rest of it. PARENTS: this is probably not a good film for kids under 5 years old (empirical observation).Other reviews have pretty well covered the material, but I will highlight what worked for me. 1) anti Disney-formula 2) no songs 3) no cute animals or sidekicks 4) fine artwork 5) inspired storytelling & script 6) straight forward yet dead-on vocal work  from the actors 7) amazing character development for the robot 8) it made me weep from both emotion of the story and joy at the quality 9) the audience was not distracting since they were all totally absorbed in the storytelling 10) great satire on many levelsWhat did I dislike? I hate the simplistic 'guns are evil' concept. The scene where the hunters run off after killing the deer, yet the kid forgets them and instructs the robot that it is the gun on the ground that did the killing. Luckily, the film corrects this later on, establishing that the real problem is with the foolish people who want to shoot anything they don't understand (the robot in this case), while the robot who is clearly designed to be a fearsome weapon is able to gain a soul through his lucky interaction with a totally unprejudiced boy and use himself not as a killing machine but rather as a heroic character. This is one small gripe for one really fine film.",Null,0,0,10 August 1999
Shrek," Excellent entertainment, sloppy animation
","I really enjoyed Shrek as light entertainment. There is nothing profound in it, but it neatly, and frequently, skewers fairy tale conventions and characters, especially the Disney ones. One has to watch it a couple of times to catch all the spoken jokes, and probably another time to catch all the visual throwaway gags which hang out in the corners of frames. In this regard the movie is clever, well written, and charming in a low sort of way. It is suitable for all ages, even with mildly borderline subject matter in some of the jokes and references. The little kids will not get the 'worst' ones, while the non prudes on the adult audience will laugh heartily.A couple of fine scenes include the one with Geppetto turning over Pinocchio to the fairy-tale-creature bounty hunters for a payment in gold (' I got here a talking puppet!'....'But I'm a REAL boy!' ... 'Then throw him in the pile with the other possessed toys!'), the duet between the princess and the bluebird, right out of at least three Disney classics, in which the princess wins the high note contest while the little bird, well, loses. And finally, a certain gag pulled countless times by Foghorn Leghorn on a certain chained dog is repeated here with a chained dragon...the setup is obvious, then they make you wait ....for...it, then the inevitable 'yipe!'. Great stuff. Did I mention the cat fight between Snow White and  Cinderella?However, being a fan of good computer animation, I was disappointed in the quality of same in Shrek. Many people have commented on how perfect the animation is here, but they either don't know better, or simply are not paying attention. The CGI folks have come up with some software which provides an improvement in the way skin, muscle, fat, etc., move on the skeletons of the characters; it is better than we have seen before. However, the animators apparently never graduated from cheap Saturday morning cartoon level character movement. Almost without exception, the lead characters move like poorly operated marionettes, the secondary characters are worse yet. Almost any Disney classic was far better in this regard. Another problem was patchy and inconsistent interface between the characters and their environments. For example, walking characters often seem to be levitating slightly above the ground, or perhaps they are failing to depress grass under foot, etc. Two fine CGI animated films, Antz and A Bug's Life were made concurrently, by Dreanworks and Pixar, respectively. In Antz, the animators were happy to have ants climbing a flower stem which was stiff, lifeless, and had leaves looking like they were plastic. In an almost identical scene from Bug's Life, the stem and leaves were swaying slightly in the air, the leaves were translucent (like real leaves by golly), and the whole assembly of the plant interacted with realism to the movements, shadows, etc. of the characters. It is this inspired attention to detail which makes Pixar the best CGI studio in the world, and why the Dreamworks crew is still the runner up. If only Pixar had made Shrek. Oh, but I still loved it as a whole.",Null,0,0,23 May 2001
The Emperor's New Groove," Best Disney in many years!
","I have been rather unhappy with Disney's offerings since Little Mermaid and Beaty and the Beast, although Lion King was decent too. The others since have left me cold, so luckily my love for animation was satisfied by the Aardman shorts & Chicken Run, the Pixar trilogy (Bug's Life & Toy Stories) amd Antz. But here, out of the blue with no previews in the movie theaters I frequent, comes this wonderful movie!Once again, Disney has used a classic tale, of a powerful but cruel and self centered individual being thrown into a scary situation with one of his lowliest underlings, and coming out a much improved person for the experience (the examples are many, but A Christmas Carol is a good example of the genre.) In this film, the powerful one is the Emperor (Kuzco - voiced by David Spade) of a Mayan/Aztec type rural kingdom. The underling is the peasant (Pacha - voiced by John Goodman) who herds the Emperor's llamas. The scary situation is the Emperor's scheming advisor (Yzma - voiced by Eartha Kitt), an almost Cruela DeVil type withered and scary old crone who fancies herself as vastly more attractive than she is, and her body building / gourmet cooking / dimwitted- yet- strangely- resourceful boy-toy / chair carrier / bodyguard (Kronk - voiced by Patrick Warburton ...don't know him? he does the voice of Buzz Lightyear in the TV show version of the Toy Story spinoffs...same kind of voice as Tim Allen in the same role.) The neat thing about the voice talent is that the characters are made to look pretty much like the actors (Eartha must have a really good sense of humor!)Anyway, it is no spoiler to say that the Emperor gets turned into a llama (she was trying to kill him with a magic potion, to be administered by Kronk, who screws up the dosage hence the odd result) and the advisor takes over the kingdom. She tasks Kronk with taking the llama out into the country and killing it, but he fails her (similar to the huntsman in Snow White, but funny this time.) When she gets word that the llama is on the loose, not dead, she takes matters into her own hands (Snow White again) and sets off in search of the talking critter with Kronk carrying her chair around with her in it...this makes for lots of funny scenes.Ant that is what this film is about (besides the moral-of-the-story aspect). It is simply a great time for all ages. The colorful scenery and nonstop slapstick is good for the kids, while the constant stream of sight gags, topical references, satire and parody delight the adults. This film has a much wittier script than most Disneys, and get this...it's a cartoon, not a musical. The characters do not sing songs at every drop of a hat. Only the Emperor gets an opening song to tell us what a great guy he thinks he is. This characteristic also sets the film apart from other Disneys.I was interested to see that the credits list very little in the way of computer animation. Also, the work seems to have taken place in Disney's tiny animation facility in their park in Florida (seems that another recent one was made entirely there) instead of in California. There is also a Paris Unit listed, so I wonder if the Disneyland-France has a similar animation facility?This film is a delight, and can easily stand multiple viewings.",Null,2,4,17 December 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Can't say enough
","This movie had me in tears, not just because of the emotion of the story lines wrapping up, but because of the realization of the totally spectacular job Jackson and company have done. I have no reservations in saying that as a complete work, the trilogy is the best movie ever made (I will allow that a great many other movies are better than any single installment of the trilogy, taken alone). I do have one point to make, in response to some earlier reviews. I very much doubt that Frodo and Sam would be burnt to a crisp while perched on the rock outcrop on the slopes of Mount Doom as lava flows below. While I am no expert on lava and volcanos, I do recall seeing footage of people walking a similar distance away from flowing lava in Hawaii, and while they look uncomfortable, they are certainly not bursting into flame or anything. They might not even be as hot as fire fighters who enter a burning building.",Null,1,2,21 December 2003
Windtalkers," Windbreakers
","First, the lead actors all did a decent job. However, the director, screenwriter, technical people of all walks just did the lamest job they could get away with. And it shows. I also need to note that the Code Talkers had only three opportunities to do their bit, and it is only for things like sending coordinates to ships so they can shell the Jap fortifications. Nothing too interesting. Actually, the best place they had to shine might have been when using an enemy radio to call off friendly fire; no code talk was used it this case as far as I could tell. The movie had lots of excitement, but the technical level is similar to the big ensemble scenes at the end of Bond films. Woo does not seem to know how to frame a scene. One example: he has a fighter/bomber swoop low over the enemy and drop a large bomb on them, then fly away. The obviously computer-animated plane comes in too slowly (slower than it could have stayed in the air), then suddenly slows way down and drops the bomb while maybe 30 feet or less above the ground, then suddenly speeds up again. The bomb falls only about its own length before hitting the ground, but in this time they had it jog sideways a bit, the better to line up with the previously filmed pyrotechnic 'explosion' I suppose. The blast is smaller than the bomb, and looks like someone set of a small packet of 4th of July sparklers. I imagine that the plane is so low because when Woo framed the landscape shot, he forget to leave enough room at the top of the picture for the area the plane would later occupy. There is scene after incompetent scene like this. ALL explosions look like standard movie pyrotechnics. Didn't they learn anything from Saving Pvt. Ryan? Aren't clods of dirt (at LEAST) supposed to fly out of explosions on the ground?
The movie itself is just poorly thought out, uninvolving cliche's. There are much better films out there this summer.",Null,0,0,23 June 2002
