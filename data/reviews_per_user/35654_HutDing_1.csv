The Blair Witch Project," Didn't think it was scary enough? Read below...
","I just returned from seeing 'The Blair Witch Project,' and it scared the pants off of me.  I've read some negative comments, but I think those people didn't understand the end of the film. As soon as I saw that last shot, a chill went down my spine, and I knew that image would be imbedded in my mind for days. Those that didn't feel that way should see the movie again and pay closer attention to the beginning. I would like to add that I don't think being frightened by the film determines whether or not you have an imagination...it's merely a testament as to what truly frightens you.  I was deathly scared of the dark when I was young, but I wasn't scared of what I saw...I was scared of what I couldn't see.  That is what the film makers were attempting with 'Blair Witch,' and I think they pulled it off well.",9,1,1,2 August 1999
