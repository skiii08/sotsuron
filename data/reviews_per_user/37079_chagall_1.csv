Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," this movie *really* is a phantom menace - beware!
","in my youth, i had been a huge star wars fan - i collected the action figures, and all the other paraphernalia. thus, when the prequel was announced, i figured it'd be something interesting to check out. unfortunately, this was not the case, as the movie has barely a synopsis, and the acting is appalling. i've seen many a bad movie but this one rules the bottom ten big time. what's even worse, this movie contains racist stereotypes: jar jar binks is the classical `yessuh, massa' no-brains-negro-character (he even was synchronized by an african-american), while matto (matto? see, i even forgot the name) alludes to the alleged jewish mentality to exploit others in order to earn money - by any means necessary. if you're an ordinary spectator, and not a fan of the series, you won't even understand what's so special about the character anakin skywalker. lucas treats the people who go watch the flick `as fans, not as an audience' (quote: the guardian, fri jul 16), and that marks him as a perfect a**hole. not to mention the blasphemic jesus-bull***t that anakin skywalker doesn't have a father but has been given birth by his mother due to divine causes - give me a break. however, i'm realistic enough to foresee that the economical success of this movie is out of question. may the pestilence be with you.",1,3,6,18 July 1999
