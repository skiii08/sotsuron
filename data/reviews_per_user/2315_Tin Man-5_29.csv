The Rock," Finally an action film about its characters
","'The Rock' is an action movie, alright, but it's an action move about its characters, and that's what saves it. It has a strong cast and strong characters and therefore the plot, about a militia group taking Alcatraz hostage and threatening to fire bombs into San Francisco if they don't get 100 million dollars, isn't what comes off the best.There are four central characters in this film. Hummel is the man in charge of this hostage takeover. He is a highly-ranked general who is doing this to teach the government a lesson: they've been neglecting forgotten soldiers who died in the Gulf and Nam, and instead of their families being told the truth, they've simply been marked as 'Missing in Action.' He is played by Ed Harris, who does such a good man torn between duty, conscience, and vengeance, he is the best film villain since Jack Nicholson in 'The Shining.'Goodspeed is a computer nerd working for the C.I.A. He's never been in combat situations, but because of his advanced knowledge of chemical bombs, they've sent him into Alcatraz with a group of Navy SEALS, and he has no idea how to react in war-like situations. Played by Nicolas Cage, his performance is believable and powerful.Anderson is the man in control of the Navy SEALS on the mission to Alcatraz. Tough as nails, bound by duty, he freely admits he agrees with Hummel's reasoning, but he says those are risks that are part of the job, and Hummel is wrong in his action because he took an oath to serve his country no matter what. He is played by Michael Biehn, who delivers a top-notch performance, and one similar to his role in 'Terminator.'But the most powerful character in the film is Mason, the only man who has ever escaped from Alcatraz. Tough, cunning, and full of one-liners, he has been caged up in a maximum security prison for years. It's hard to say whether the viewer can trust him or not, and he has many secrets and much knowledge of the facility...which is why he was chosen to go with the SEALS. He is played by Sean Connery, who's performance is perfectly Sean Connery-ish. But who would want it any other way?This film is great, and it is a great character study for anyone who might be majoring in it or just likes to watch films with good casts. Recommended. ****1/2 out of *****.",6,90,146,2 May 1999
The Blair Witch Project," The SCARIEST movie ever made....and not a single drop of blood.
","I've been reviewing movies for a long time. I'm the Entertainment Editor for a local newspaper, and I've been studying films for a while. I thought I had the whole movie thing pretty much figured out, and I went in to see 'The Blair Witch Project' thinking, yeah....just another quickie filmed to cash in on the success of 'Scream.'What I saw defied and challenged everything I have ever known about filmmaking, and quite frankly, it's sending me back to the books to try to figure out just how the heck they managed to pull it off.This is indeed the scariest, creepiest movie that has ever come out of Hollywood....EVER. Scarier than 'Night of the Living Dead.' Scarier than 'Scream.' Scarier than anything. You name it, I've seen most of them. And they don't hold a candle to this one.The reason is, there's no monster. No real emphasis of supernatural events. Just three college students trapped in the woods, in a battle with unseen supernatural forces and nature. This alone would have set the stages for a good movie, kind of an interesting play on paranioa. But it takes it a level higher....or maybe a level lower. It's filmed like a documentory, with a camcorder that shakes and moves the whole time. And that leaves it all absolutely nervewracking.Here's the premise, and it's pretty simple: three college students are out to film a documentory about the Blair Witch, an Urban Legend from the woods of Maryland. But upon a closer examination, they get lost in the woods, and it's basically an account of their struggle, from fleeing from ghostly apparitions in the night to battling with each other. And it's all filmed on a camcorder, and presented like one would present a family vacation that they taped themselves. It's not even in widescreen format....just plain camcorder.Therefore, it's all realistic, and you question whether or not it is false or ACTUAL footage, due to the authenticity. I was in a cold sweat fifteen minutes into it, and but the terrifying closing scene, I was losing my nerve and trembling violently. Only one other film has come close to having this affect on me....the original 'Candyman'....but it doesn't come anywhere close to this. I knew that film was made up....But this....this challenged fiction and you are absolutely convinced it is real. Kevin Williamson, hate to say it, but you've suddenly been booted into second place by a handful of unprofessionals!What also helps its realism is the fact that the actors are so great. Most horror movies nowadays have great looking leading teenage actors getting slashed, but this one features normal looking people in terrifying situations. How affective are they? Believe me when I say that Oscar nominations WILL arise.... The character of Heather (an actress playing herself, like her co-stars) has a scene in which she apologizes to the camera for getting her friends into this whole mess. She knows she will die soon, and she is trembling with fear....and it is the finest performance I have ever seen in a horror movie....ever.Filmed with almost no budget (a budget would have taken away from it), it is choppy and a mess....just like a camcorder recording always is....and that just helps the situation. And this only enhanced the true affect of the film. No film has ever scared me as terribly as this movie.... Go see it only if you think you're strong enough to handle it. Not for the intense gore (there is none), but for the true suspence. This is indeed a horror film that challenges the idea that horror movies need gore, and I totally respect that. That challenge it also sent me screaming, and it will you, as well.********** out of *****",Null,1,1,9 August 1999
Alien 3," How about a director's cut, Mr. Finscher?
","The Alien movies have always been about their characters, with the creatures themselves taking back seat to the human reaction to them. In 'Alien' (****), there was animosity on the ship as the seven astronauts were initially torn between their job and their desire to go home. They had to put their differences aside in order to fight their common enemy: the alien creature bent on eating them. In 'Aliens' (****), the military must overcome hysteria, deception, and clausterphobia in order to escape from an entire army of alien creatures. These films are classics for a reason--the strong characters are what take center stage and manage to balance logos with ethos, making for very powerful character studies within a sci-fi/horror premise.When 'Alien' 3 came out, none of that character chemistry was present. While I can name you nine prominent characters, besides the continuing character Ripley, that were effectively created to stand out from the second film (off the top of my head: Hicks, Hudson, Bishop, Vasquez, Gorman, Newt, Burke, Drake, Apone) only three characters come off with any depth in number three, one of which who is inappropriately killed just as his character development was beginning to pay off. As a result, despite impressive visuals, great direction, and powerful performances by the leads, the film lumbers when it should have soared. Given the quality of the other films in the series (even the fourth film that followed, 'Alien: Resurrection' (***), which restored the rich characters), I couldn't help but wonder just what in the world happened during filming that undermined the characters of this film. Then I get wind of the twenty or so minutes that were cut out of the final version. For a complete listing of the scenes, look on the alternate versions page. After reading the script for Alien 3, I must confess that these scenes, when restored, not only bring the film up to greater heights than it achieved in its final version, but it was the best, darkest film in the series. Why on earth these brilliant scenes of character development and thematic discussions were cut is beyond me. They shape the film to have a very good theme and the characters are the most intruiging of the series. Great scenes explaining the motivations of Morse, Golic, Junior and others were lost on the cutting room floor. These scenes weren't only important for character development, but they were also necessary to shape the story and give it a rounder and broader thematic purpose.With the success David Finscher has had in his recent films (deservedly so--'Fight Club' remains one of the most powerful cinematic experiences of my life, and let me tell you, I've had quite a few), I hope that he is able to restore 'Alien 3' with a director's cut. If he reissues scenes to restore the fluency missing in the plot and characters, he would recreate a film which not only would become the best film in the alien series, but also one of the finest horror thrillers ever made! I can only hope that he find time and motivation to take on such a project, as it would be the most effective director's cut since 'Blade Runner.'Final cut: ** out of **** With restored scenes: **** out of ****",Null,0,1,15 April 2002
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Awesome, awesome, awesome....
","In the long line to see this film, several people and I agreed:The sixties gave us Star Trek. The seventies gave us Star Wars. The eighties gave us Highlander. ....and the nineties gave us Star Wars again.The Phantom Menace is AWESOME! How can I talk about the plot without giving away a part of storyline, thus breaking the code of silence the Star Wars fans have all sworn (and I can't let George Lucas down, can I?). But let me just say this: the action is awesome (the finest light saber warfare yet filmed), the characters are over the top, and the villains....led by Darth Maul, are wonderful (though they'll never be Darth Vader).I grew up with Star Wars, so it was wonderful to see Yoda and C3-PO are Artoo again. The plot is great (a lot tamer and political than the other three, but I think Lucas intended it that way...after all, this is answering all the questions of the first films...not everything can be as exciting...but they can be just as entergetic), and the direction is crisp. My personal favorite character is the Captain of the Princess's guards (kinda of the silent, Terminator type), but everything about it is wonderful. True masterpieces in filmmaking are the movies that draw you into it so much, you're literally sad when the credits start rolling. This is one of those films, and I can't wait till Episode Two. But until it pops up, drop what you're doing and go see this work of art, and be amazed at the fact that George Lucas still is KING!Awesome, awesome, awesome....",2,1,2,19 May 1999
Shakespeare in Love," This beat Private Ryan?
","'Shakespeare in Love' is a nice little movie, featuring nice little actors and a nice little movie. I rather enjoyed it, in all honesty, but I really don't feel that it was up to par to win seven Academy Awards, and I am especially insulted that it could ever beat 'Saving Private Ryan,' the masterpiece epic of World War II, for best picture.It's an interesting idea, about Shakespeare writing 'Romeo and Juliet' because he was inspired by an actual love affair. It's borders between romantic comedy and historical piece, and it works pretty good. The cast is good (especailly Judi Dench) and the direction is nice for the balance of genres. Great costumes, too. However, there are some major flaws. Gregory Rush is barely used. He has a few nice scenes in the beginning, but then he is reduced to a backdrop. Guys, if you're going to have Rush's excellence in a film, USE him. And just the opposite for Ben Affleck. What the heck was he doing in this film? He reminded me that episode of Seseme Street with Julia Roberts...Out of place and fully aware of it.... Oh, nevermind. You get the picture.The whole idea is also inaccurate. Obviously, the writers didn't realize (or they chose to ignore) the fact that Romeo and Juliet was already a popular storyline at the time William wrote it, and he just redid it for the play. So that makes this whole movie impossible. With this knowledge in mind, this was a real dissapointment, considering it was played like it could have possibly been inspired from real events.Mr. Speilberg, I'd like to apologize on behalf of all of the people who know that S.P.R. should have won. I swear, someone paid the people off for this one to win best picture. It was a fun little film, but certainly not a masterpiece like your epic. Better luck next time.*** out of *****",Null,0,1,11 August 1999
The 13th Warrior," Flawed but fascinating retelling of the 'Beowulf' story *spoiler's warning*
","[This review contains spoilers]Being familiar with both the novel that this is based on, 'Eaters of the Dead,' and the epic poem that book was based on, 'Beowulf,' I as a viewer can look at this film on many angles....angles perhaps the average viewer who has read neither cannot. Antonio Banderas plays Ibn Fadlan, a Moor who is on a peace mission who gets tangled up with Viking warriors. While at their village, a small child arrives with news: a group of evil monsters called the wendol (or Grendle) have been slaughtering their people and eating them, and King Hrothgar has requested help. Twelve of the selected warriors, led by Buliwyf (or Beowulf), must be of their race, but as tradition goes, the thirteenth warrior must be from another land. Therefore, Ibn is reluctantly recruited, hence the title. And from then on, it's pretty much the story of the thirteen men's battles with the creatures, who turn out to be men who think they're bears (complicated). The warriors eventually battle the mother, and the familiar story of Beowulf comes into play, with the supernatural villians being replaced by really mean-looking norsemen.Here is where the major flaw of the film takes place. The idea in itself it brilliant, about a realistic version of the 'Beowulf' poem is played out through the eyes of a spectator. However, this film is victim to major cuts, which result in major plot conflicts being omitted. In the novel, Ibn is extremely unwilling to be a warrior, and the story is pretty much about how he, through watching Buliwyf, learns to become one of them. However, in this film, hardly any time is explored looking into the character of Ibn. He's simply there, and hardly any reluctance is seen in his character. Banderas simply plays the role as happy to be of service when he is selected to go with the warriors, but later on in the film, he is reluctant to fight. Therefore, the viewer has a hard time understanding the character of Ibn. In fact, it's all the other warriors, played by a bunch of unknowns, who have better defined characters (look for Stevens, the loony Irishman from 'Braveheart,' as the red-headed warrior...one of the major characters). It wouldn't have hurt the editors to include a few scenes featuring Ibn's reluctance in order to allow the viewer to understand him better.The plot also has a hard time finding it's footing, though that's completely understandable. Considering the story of Beowulf never really had one steady plot, this film is pretty much what the poem is: series of battles interwoven with dialogue. So, that's forgivable. 'Eaters of the Dead' handled that problem with showing Ibn adjusting to the ways of the vikings, and showing his relationships with the warriors, as he grows from reluctance to bravery. Since this film never really shows Ibn reluctant, that idea can't be used, so instead, this film must be judged as the poem is (unintentionally, I'm sure, but I'll let that one slide!).But once those flaws are out of the way, what's left is an excellent, ingenious film with some of the finest performances, landscapes, and battling sequences ever put on film. Director McTiernan shows off his talents in all his full glory, showing tough, rugged battle sequences that are both stunningly real and over-the-top. Not since 'Braveheart' have battle scenes looked so brilliant. The director also takes advantage of the landscape as well....I don't know about anyone else, but I'm ready to pack up my bags and move to the Norseman land!The principle story is also clever. This is probably the most faithful film to be based on a work by Michael Critchon, and the scientific approach to 'Beowulf' is well-handled. Especially at the end, when we learn *spoilers warning* that it is Ibn who wrote the 'Beowulf' story in honor of the life of Buliwyf (an idea the book didn't include). And the final battle is moving and stirring: As the villians march for the warriors, there is an emotional scene and Ibn prays to Allah, and then stands up and joins his friends in a Norseman chant, praying to their gods for victory. The parallel shows that Ibn has truly become one of these men, and together they stand, fighting as one. Wow....What an incredible scene.So while there are flaws, as a whole, this film stands as a fascinating retelling of the 'Beowulf' theme....One that I think the original, unnamed poet would have been proud of.*** out of ****",Null,2,3,28 August 1999
The Mummy," Brainless, but it's a lot of fun!
","I think Roger Ebert got it right when he said that this film was as loud and obnoxious as the original Boris Karloff film was quiet and creepy. That is the absolute truth. In fact, this film has little to do with the 1932 film, and even littler to do with any other mummy film ever made, which got increasingly dreadful. I mean, who can really be scared of a slow-moving zombie who's tripping on his own bandages? This one, however, manages to bring the mummy genre up a few scales, and as a result, it's a harmless, entertaining trek.This is the third film to have the title 'The Mummy,' Karloff's and a 1959 Hammer film sharing the same title. Though it does feature armies of undead zombies, supernatural occurrences, and immense evil, it is quite difficult to label this film as a horror. Indeed, there's really no horror about it. Instead, it comes across as a fun, Indiana Jones-esque adventure yarn about Brandon Fraser and company battling the undead mummy, who kills his victims and sucks the life out of them, thus becoming more and more human. All this trouble starts when they open Imhotep's tomb and unleash his undead body...and that's basically the plotline.Thin story aside, this movie is really just a series of endless action scenes, featuring one-liners and plently of breathtaking special effects. But that doesn't make it a bad film. In fact, it is quite a good one. It's the epitome of popcorn film, and while it might be brainless, that's okay. If these kind of films are done right, they are very fun and quite memorable. And they do it right, with great timing and a terrific performance by Brandon Fraser. And while it might not be up to par with Indiana Jones, who cares? It's quite a special effects, rollar coaster ride!Leave your brain at the house and enjoy!*** out of ****",Null,0,0,13 August 1999
The Terminator," 'I'll be BOCK!'
","Inspiring countless spin-offs, rip-offs, and parodies, this cold, gritty, tough sci-fi actioneer was the film that launched its stars and director into international stardom and jumpstarted Arnold Schwarzenegger's career.The plot is pretty simple, but at the same time, mind-boggling. It's about a great war in the future: machines vs. humans. After years of combat, the humans eventually win under the leadership of Captain John Conner, and as a final counterattack, the machines blast a cyborg back through time to destroy the mother of Conner before he was born, thus preventing the humans' victory. But Conner finds out about the plan, and he sends back a military man of his own. So it's pretty much a battle of cat-and-mouse around the city of New York, as the military man, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) tries to protect Sarah Conner (Linda Hamilton) from his ruthless, unstoppable cyborg counterpart (Arnold Schwarzenegger). Jammed with breathtaking action scenes and believable performances, this movie became an instant classic, and director James Cameron, who would later win an Oscar for directing 'Titanic,' got instant recognition.The dark colors alone in the movie make it memorable....(Can anyone recall more than about a minute of daytime in this film?) providing atmosphere that works. Awesome Arnie is also effecient as the Terminator, the ruthless cyborg, as he stalks Sarah and kills anyone who he has to in pursuit of her. But really, this is Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn's movie, as their characters are forced to survive together and Sarah must come to grips with the fact that she's the mother of the world's savior. Romance blossoms, of course, and all in all, I think it's the human story behind those two that really makes the film effective. Therefore, Arnold's really a backdrop for a bigger picture. His story really shows up in the sequel, which is also a great film.See 'The Terminator' if you have not yet. It's not for the squeamish, featuring drilling action scenes that drag on for a long time, but it's certainly worth as much money as you can spare to rent it!***** out of *****",Null,0,0,25 August 1999
Sleepy Hollow," A Highlander fan's paradise
","Before I begin my review, I issue a challenge to anyone who might feel up to it: Go into this movie and actually count the number of heads that are severed from a person's shoulders.... I lost count after about twenty.... By all means, count and send me a private message... I really am curious!This film is probably the best-looking horror movie I've ever seen. Visually, it is brilliant, depicting an all new world in the small town of Sleepy Hollow....one that literally sucks you in suddenly and without warning. The visuals in themselves are outstanding, but it is the atmosphere of this small town, in the grand tradition of the Hammer films from the days of olde, that is really compelling. Story-wise, it's not bad either, though it's about as close to the orginal Irving story as 'The Greatest Story Ever Told' is short. The only thing that exists from the original short story are the names of the characters. Icabod Crane is a detective sent from New York to Sleepy Hollow by Christopher Lee (you gotta love it!) to investigate a series of bizaar murders: It seems that there has been four decapitations, and the heads are missing. Everyone in the town suspects the headless horseman (Christopher Walken in flashbacks, Ray Park in all the headless scenes), the ghost of an old sadistic British officer. Crane, however, seeks to prove otherwise. After meeting the town's white witch (beautiful Christina Ricci....Quite a leap from her Wednesday days!) and encountering the Headless Horseman for himself, he is convinced otherwise, and the rest of the film is devoted to him tracking down the undead creature, kind of taking the role of a Sherlock Holmes meets Dr. Van Helsing.This is Tim Burton's best work since 'Edward Scissorhands.' The cast, the suspense, and the stunts are all a feast for the eyes. The gore is also there unashamedly.... This might be the most grisely film in recent film history. It really isn't the violence that sinks in, however, in the long run....The film is stylish enough as it is. But of course, with the appearance of such horror veterans as Christopher Lee, Kevin Yagher, Michael Gough, and even Burton himself, you have to expect a few extra buckets of blood. Uhhh...better make that a few extra truck-loads...It's worth watching, however, for the town of Sleepy Hollow alone. What a weird, weird place.... Burton really overdoes himself with this. Not recommended for children or the faint-of-heart.... The film itself is more creepy than scary, but after about the first three hundred and sixty heads are sliced off, even I was getting a little sick to my stomach.... Though I have to admit....it was Burton, it was Hollywood horror at its best...and I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT!***1/2 out of ****",Null,0,0,19 November 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Best of the Trilogy
","Return of the Jedi surfs the thin line in between the darkness of Empire (Luke's soul searching) and the fun of New Hope (the Ewoks...hey! I thought they were cool!). I think it's the best of the series, but they were all so perfect, I won't try to defend it. They were all masterpieces.Nicely capping the story of our heroes of the Rebellion (for any extraterrestrials out there who don't know: Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leiah, Lando Carlissian, Chewbacca, C3-P0, Artoo-D2), it also featers the fates of the dreaded Lord Vader and Emperor Palpatine. It does such a wonderful job bringing the trilogy to a full circle and featuring each character so that they are memorable (Jabba the Hutt was the man, and the scene in which Han lets Lando fly the Falcon is great!), that how can I do anything but suggest it was the greatest of the series?Watch this if you haven't, but make sure you watch the first two beforehand. If not, it will be incoherent...but not boring.",Null,1,2,20 May 1999
Romeo + Juliet," Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't. This one didn't.
","Many classic stories and epics have been updated to be set in different time periods than when they were originally intended. Branagh's 'Hamlet' updated it to the nineteenth century. The 1995 French film 'Les Miserables' had the classic story set in World War II. Christopher Lambert's 'Beowulf' was set 2000 years hence in a post-apocalyptic future. Even Frankenheimer's 'Island of Dr. Moreau' was relocated to present day.This film seemed to start the trend, however. It's been set in present day Miami, and all in all, it's an excellent and absorbing film. The cast is great--especially Danes, DeCRAPio, and Leguizamo-- and the direction is crisp. The camera work is also dazzling, and it gives the familiar story of the Star-crossed lovers new colors.But despite the pluses in this film, there is still just something odd about seeing an African-American male in dred locks carrying a gun (with the word 'Sword' cleverly written on it) and saying, 'Draw forth thou sword!' I almost wish that they had relocated this film back to the way Shakespeare had intended it-- in the dawn of the Rennaisance. Everything about this film and its camera work and all the odd things about it work fine for Shakespeare, except for the fact it's been relocated. I had to keep reminding myself that this film was set in modern day, because the language told me otherwise. When I first saw it, I was terribly confused because of the cars and the guns and the skyscrapers.... The way they handled it made me feel like I was watching a film taking place in the far past. There could have been some way that the director could have made it more 'modern' and still keep the classic language. Instead, all the moderations just feel out of place.This doesn't make it a bad movie, however. It's still mesmerizing. It's definitely a good date film (especially if you're a guy...expect your date to be crying in you shoulder), and it keeps your attention. Give it a try, and just keep in mind that it does take place in present day, even though it makes it really confusing. But that's okay. If you understand half of what they're talking about anyway, you're doing fine.*** out of ****",Null,1,2,24 June 1999
Pitch Black," Dynamite
","'Pitch Black''s basic premise, while certainly intriguing, doesn't really offer anything new that really advances the science fiction genre to new heights. Movies like this rely on tenser things to make them work: Memorable characters, gripping, terrifying scenes, and stylistic choreography. 'Pitch Black' has all three. I have always believed that an effective science fiction film is one while introduces the viewer into a whole new world of its own and then invites the viewer to suspend their disbelief and go along with it. If the science fiction film is good, then the viewer will be so intrigued by the notion of the film that they will allow the movie to suck them into it, and they become lost in this film's new world. Few films have achieved this style of brilliance. The 'Star Wars' saga did. 'Dark City,' one of the best sleeper-films of 1999, did. 'The Matrix' did. The first 'Highlander' film did. And now, 'Pitch Black' can be added to that list.The very essence of this film, the plot notwithstanding, is in the execution of making the viewer feel absolute terror in this strange, barren, desert-like planet inhabited by creatures of the night, in which space explorers crashland on after a hull breech. It works, thanks to realistic characters and stunning choreography. The two principal colors in this film are black and white, with most of it taking place only with the lights shining on the faces of the actors and the alien creatures flying overhead. The characters are not the standard 'good guy' and 'bad guy' cliches either. There are several significant characters here: A super-human serial killer, a morphine-addicted bounty hunter, a captain with a secret, a Muslim priest, an athiest, an antique dealer (who, *spoilers* has one of the best death scenes in film history), and a child. All of them present both evil sides and good sides, and a cast of characters hasn't been so motely in a sc-fi film since 'Aliens'This film, however, cannot be compared to 'Aliens.' Nor 'The Terminator,' or 'Predator,' or other successful sci-fi thrillers. This film is simply 'Pitch Black,' in a league of its own. And it works. An early prediction: This film will either become a sleeper and quickly get dumped to video, or else it will achieve the status of 'The Matrix.' It will probably be either one or the other, with little in between. We shall see.On a personal note as well, keep an eye on Vin Diesel, who plays the mad serial killer. If any producer reads this, he might be a good choice for the role of Beowulf in the upcoming version that Roland Emmerich's company is working on. He's well built and has a lot of screen presence.

Duck Soup," FREEDONIA LIVES!
","This is by far the Marx Brother's greatest film, and therefore, one of comedy's greatest achievements. The last film by the four crazies to be made by Paramount, the film tells the story of Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho....who is perfectly Groucho-ish) setting up his kingdom as the new prime minsister of the land of Freedonia. And there's an evil villain (Louis C. Calhern) who wants to take over the whole land.That's....pretty much the plot, and it's basically interweved with comedic sketches and crazy characters. Of course, the other three brothers play pretty substantial roles.... Harpo is Pinky and Chico is Baravelli, the two enemy spies who keep switched sides. Then there's straight-man Zeppo as Bob Rolland, Groucho's secretary who's sappy and always willing to please and serve his older brother. Actually, Zeppo is given a lot more to do compared to earlier films....it's actually his idea for Groucho to insult Calhern, and that's what leads to the war.Ah, yes, the war.... Did I mention that this film is also a satire on war films? The last fifteen minutes or so, in which the four brothers and the ever-lovable Margarete Dumont are stuck in a collapsing house in the midst of battle, are probably the single-most hilarious scenes ever to be put on film. The antics and non-stop, and the brothers know no bounds. The balance of their different comic-personalities work and play off each other in a way that it never did again (although the  passenger room scene in 'A Night at the Opera' came awfully close). Harpo's silent clown and Chico's pessimistic antics are well balanced with each other, as usual. (Groucho: 'Chicolini, why are you back? I thought you were on the other side.' Chico: 'I was, but the food's better on this side.') Groucho is his usual comedic, wise-cracking self ('Fight for this woman's honor, which is more than she's ever done!'). And Zeppo lends help as the straight man trying to keep his older brothers under control (Groucho: 'Look at them all flee!' Zeppo: 'But Your Excellency....' Groucho: 'Remind me to give myself a medal of honor for this!' Zeppo: 'But Your Excellency, you're shooting your own men!')This film is simply comedy at it's best. Political satire that's way ahead of its time, show-stopping songs ('Freedonia's Going to War' is also a highlight), and a brilliant mirror sequence between Groucho and Harpo that must be seen to be believed! All in all, this is a perfect example of everything comedy should be. Even after almost seventy years....this film hasn't lost it's fire or wit. It simply proves the fact that there are kings of comedy, and they're names are GROUCHO, HARPO, CHICO, and ZEPPO MARX! Recommended!!!'Oh, Your Excellency!'

Apocalypse Now," Dark, depressing, and haunting
","Francis Ford Coppola's take on Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' just might be the most enduring and well thought-out film about the Vietnam War. While it contains many innacuracies, it does present haunting jungle footage, intense action scenes, and graphic characterizations that proves the the Vietnam War was one of America's darkest hours. Or, as Colonel Kurtz puts it, 'The horror, the horror.'There is little I can say for this film that hasn't been said already. Coppola has a masterpiece here, portraying hearts of immense evil in which the Vietnam War serves as a backdrop. Sure, the war in itself was evil, but what kind of horrendous insanity causes such evil to exist that enables such wars to be fought? The story of Willard (Martin Sheen) as he hunts down the AWOL Kurtz (Marlon Brando) seeks to answer such questions....and does it ever. I dare not give anything away, but I will state this: the final twenty minutes are some of the most intense in motion picture history.
This is not a film for the squeamish. Choppy and dismal, it will leave a bad taste in your mouth....a taste like you've never tasted before. And that's exactly what the Vietnam War did for everyone involved with it. Any film that can bring out 'the horror, the horror' of it all as this film did deserves to be called one of the greatest motion pictures ever made!**** out of ****",Null,0,0,24 September 1999
The Patriot," Seems like two movies stuck together
","I shall be brief with 'The Patriot,' a cross between 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Braveheart' in the Revolutionary War. It seems like two different movies stuck together: One is a serious, if typical Hollywood war film about a fictitious character parading around trying to make the country free. Though it is fictitional, it works thanks to great battle scenes and an excellent Mel Gibson. While it is impossible and foolish to view it as a serious movie about the horrors of war, it works as a by-the-numbers adventure story, and I found it enjoyable viewing( though it is loaded with cliched material, i.e.: there's always the tolkien black man fighting for his freedom, ever since 'Glory,' a much better war movie, made it famous, though 'The Patriot'  hardly takes such an important subject as seriously as it should be taken).The other part is not so gratifying. Some scenes seem downright cartoonish, and not appropriate for a film that is intended to be taken as seriously as this one claims to be. The scene where Mel Gibson, in an effort to recruit men for his malitia, explains, 'God save King George,' only to and knives thrown at him is enjoyable enough, but it plays too much like a Bugs Bunny/Elmer Fudd cartoon to be shown here. There are also a few scenes which play like a bad TV-movie, especially those which take place in the church where Heath Ledger's character goes recruiting for soldiers in a church. Those scenes were predictable and corny. That plus the fact that Ledger's girlfriend was a horrible actress, on the level of a guest star in a bad 'Christie' episode.So here's what we have: An excellently-produced and well-acted drama using the Revolutionary War as a backdrop fused with often cliched subplots and scenes which are too goofy and not serious enough. Hence, it's hard to tell what this film is trying to be: Campy or emotionally charged. For this reason, it lumbers when it should soar, and it is disappointing where it should be outstanding.**1/2 out of ****",Null,1,1,17 January 2001
Pearl Harbor," An insult and a travesty
","Not in any way to make light of the terrible, horrible tragedy that took place today, but since the attack at the Pentagon and the World Trade Center is being compared with the attack on Pearl Harbor, I shall briefly make my point by bringing it up:Imagine, several years down the road, someone making a movie about the terribly tragedy at the World Trade Center, turning it into a pointless action movie which glamourizes the deaths of thousands of people in some action scenes (using, of course, amazing special effects), and then sugar-coating it with a fictional love story that has nothing to do with the event and suggesting that it is a more important topic to cover for most of the film than the event which it is supposed to be honoring.
Thus is the nature of 'Pearl Harbor.' It doesn't honor the tragedy of sixty years ago....it desensetises people to its horror and rapes its impact on the nation. This is a film spitting on the honor of our fighting boys, and it should have never been made.zero out of ****. Less than that, even. To give it zero stars, I am suggesting that it is worthy of being even considered or watched, and I refuse to rate this film on the level of a 'movie'. It is betraying to a nation. My heart and prayers go out to the loved ones of those killed in Washington and New York today.",1,1,2,11 September 2001
Saving Private Ryan," John Wayne, eat your heart out!
","What makes Speilberg's WWII epic 'Saving Private Ryan' so great is the fact that it takes a plot from a 1940's war propaganda film starring, oh...perhaps John Wayne... and makes it real. The plot line is simple: Eight men are assigned to find one man whose brothers have all been killed and send him home. The question is, is the lives of eight men worth risking for the life of one? Speilberg, in all of his brilliance, manages to take this simple story and uses it as both an excellent character study and as a vehicle for  graphic depictions of World War II: No more is there blood and glory....Just horror and fear. These men who are fighting aren't the fearless war heroes of all the propoganda films of the 40's. On the contrary, they are normal, average men who are afraid and who hate this mission. They aren't just actors...They are you and I in these situations, presenting our humanity and our frailtiess in chaos.This might be the first film to depict World War II in such a way. Of course, it helps that it is backed by an excellent cast (Tom Hanks, Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, Matt Damon, Ted Danson to name only a few) that knows how to portray each character in memorable ways. But also, this might be the most gruesome of all wars films, not beating around the bush when it comes to the realistic violence that resulted from the war. Limbs are blown off, brains are shot out....The violence is aplenty, but not in a way to glorify it, as many war films do. No, this film uses it to reiterate the original idea: War is hell...no, it's worse, and it's not something be glorified. These men sacrificed their lives for us, being no better than us and no worse....And if it was you in the situation, you would have to do the same. Respect that.There's no question about it. This film *should have* won best picture, and it was absolutely robbed. If 'Shakespeare in Love' was one millionth this film, it might have had a chance at competing against it.... How it beat this masterpiece is beyond me....Ignore the foolish academy. This film is the greatest of 1998...Perhaps one of the greatest of the decade....********************************************************************************************** out of ****",Null,0,0,5 November 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A step back from Fellowship--flawed, but engaging **MAJOR SPOILERS**
","*SPOILERS* I've seen it, I've sat on it, I've thought about it, and I'm going to go see it again tonight. For now, here is my verdict:There are a lot of things I can forgive for the sake of poetic license. Among them:1. Faramir. My FAVORITE character from the books. Period. At first, I was pissed off. Now, I understand that poetic license had to be taken to make the character and his interaction with the movie for tense. In the end, he resists the ring, and his character was shown having the integrity and strength that Boromir lacked. Not exactly the brilliant foil for his older brother and father that he was in the book, but the tension helped with Galadriel's monologue about the 'sons of Gondor taking the ring.'2. The different ending. Or rather, the cut-off point being different from the book. They killed Boromir at the end of FotR anyway, so having also altered the beginning, I can see why they would save Frodo's capture for the beginning of RotK to maintain better story arcs.3. Aragorn's fall off the cliff. A little pointless, but for purposes of dreaming about Arwen, I guess it works.4. A three or four page passage taking forty-five minutes in the movie: Okay, for purposes of being climactic, Peter Jackson did a similar exension for the ogre battle in Moria in Fellowship. Sure, it would take longer than the book described, and focusing on this for the film worked.5. Reduced role for Frodo. After all, they cover the most significant parts. At first, I felt like they did not focus on the ring and that it played second fiddle to the human story, but I realized this was necessary to see HOW powerful the ring and Sauron's influence really was. By focusing on Helm's Deep, we realize the stakes were higher. In FotR, we understood that the ring was dangerous, but all they did was talk about it and search for it. It was buildup for the war. In TTT, we see the battle that the ring is causing in full-throttle. Frodo's reduced part was necessary, and they still got his mission and temptation across. The way he stroked the ring, and his fall into the lake because of its influence were very effective moments. So is his obsession with Gollum (after all, he sees himself, doesn't he?). At first, I'd have liked to have seen more, but now that I have considered it, they portrayed it as much as was necessary. Galadriel's monologue was also necessary to remind us just what was at stake, and that this entire battle was about the ring.What I cannot forgive:1. The lack of characterization in Gandalf. Where WAS he?!!?!? If I hadn't been familiar with the original story, I'd have been completely confused as to why he was now 'the White.' I can understand McKellen's (wise) choice to play the Grey and the White as two seperate characters. But I cannot forgive the emptiness of the role. How was he different? How were his powers different? How was his personality different? These ideas are never explored. He just comes in, has a few lines, and disappears. GANDALF IS LORD OF THE RINGS! Couldn't we have at least seen a little character development.2. Lack of characterization for Saruman. Again, just a few lines, and he's gone. No sense of forbidding and power that he had in the first film. In fact, they could have used archive footage from the first film for his part (though the 'exorcism' from Theodin was well-done). The scene where he watched the Ents destroy Isengard was laughable...he just stood there and looked p***ed off. At the very most, they could have developed the reltionship between he and Grima a little bit better. Which leads me to.....3. Grima's character going nowhere. If Saruman was POSSESSING Theodin, why was Grima needed at all? He just uttered a few lines, looking imposing in the film's first act, and then disappeared. I understand that Peter Jackson sees the Lord of the Rings as a nine-hour movie and that we'll see more of Grima later, but he could have given us some sort of sense of completion for the purposes of waiting one more year. Though I did like that single tear fall from his eye as he beheld the army (a sly reference to his role in Exorcist III, as the film already referenced The Exorcist anyway).4. Some lazy storytelling. I enjoyed the Exorcism of Theodin scene, but I had a hard time figuring out if Saruman was in his domain or if he was actually thrown out of Theodin and was with the others in the castle. There are also a number of plot holes. How could Boromir fight in the woods and get shot with arrows quickly, and yet Aragorn and Gimli could fight on the draw bridge fifty times the number of orcs that Boromir was fighting and remain unscathed? I just don't understand this. It's just lazy story telling. Some of the pacing was a bit off, too. WAY too much time was spent with Merry and Pippin with the Ents. I love the Ents as much as the next fellow, but speed us up already. By the time they're in the woods deciding whether or not to join the war, we've having enough exposition and decision making from all the other characters. I for one would have rather seen them cut to the chase.What I liked:Fortuntanely, I loved all the rest. The development of Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas was wonderful. We get a better sense of these characters (I especially enjoyed the competition between Legolas and Gimli). Gimli served as the comic relief, but it didn't take away from the character's integrity. Aowen and Theodin were wonderful additions, as was Faramir, even though his change was controversial. Treebeard was inventive, and Gollum was the most convincing CGI character I have ever seen. The battles were epic, and every square inch of the screen is loaded with detail.Peter Jackson has taken a fantasy story and has filmed it like it was a historical World War II film. The realism and the stakes presented works, and most of this approach blew me away the same way an effective historical war film ('Saving Private Ryan' or 'The Longest Day') would. If Fellowship belonged to the Hobbits, Towers is the story of the humans' continuing battle, and they all must make important choices. Does Aragorn stay at Helm's Deep and fall for Aowen? Does Theodin lead his people into an attack? Does Aowen love Aragorn? Does Arwen leave with the elves or stay for Aragorn (she's a elf, but she wants to be human, after all)? Does Faramir do the duty of his position to please his father, or does he do what it right? All of these questions are strongly developed. And the payoffs are wonderful and show the power of the human spirit, much like war films.I trust Peter Jackson, and I look forward to Return of the King. That said, The Two Towers was overall a step backwards from Fellowship, and I hope that Jackson does not get over confident in his ability. He had to PROVE himself with Fellowship. Lord of the Rings in arguable the greatest fantasy series ever written, and it has harbored millions of fans. There were a lot of expecations from fans. Perhaps too many. He had to prove that he could look past all of the weight of the trilogy's momentum and make a great film out of the books we all love. And he did. He brought us a masterful film which, like The Godfather, made us appreciate the original text even more and also spun the ideas in new directions. This does not give him permission to slack off with the rest of his work. Develop those characters more. Keep the pacing interesting. Don't compromise getting a film done quick and making money over quality. In other words, DON'T PULL A LUCAS!!!!But I love you, Peter. And I know that Return of the King will be a satisfactory wrap-up to this wonderful series of films that you're making.Final verdict: Seven out of ten, *** out of ****.(Fellowship: 9.5 out of 10, **** out of ****)",10,0,0,20 December 2002
Casualties of War," Shattering and unforgettable
","When does immorality cross the lines in a war? Naturally, civility and normality fly out the window....after all, war is about killing people. But are there rules to it? Ideals we should follow as we engage upon the enemy? This film answers that question, and the answer is yes.I have a large interest in the Vietnam War, primarily because it is considered by many to be America's darkest hour. Watching a film like this forces me to agree. The story is about a platoon of five men, and how their 'fearless' leader (an excellent Sean Penn) kidnapps a Vietmanese girl and taunts his men to beat her and rape her. Only one man stands in the way, who knows that what they are doing is wrong (Michael J. Fox, in probably his greatest role). The kidnapping eventually leads to the murder of the girl, and Fox is determined to bring the men to justice, even though Penn argues that 'what happens on the field stays on the field.'This is director Brian De Palma's finest hour. Rarely has the Vietnam War been presented as so haunting, showing the effects war has one people.... The U.S. were arguably the good guys in the war, but even the greatest of men have their breaking points. And few films show those breaking points as well as this one. Indeed, this is one of the finest films to come out to ever represent Vietnam for what it was: controversial, tragic....and disturbing.**** out of ****",Null,0,0,24 September 1999
From Dusk Till Dawn," Plotwise, it's shoddy, but--
","As for as plotline goes for 'From Dusk Till Dawn,' it's all pretty threadbare and nothing that hasn't been done before...and better. In fact, it can be summed up like this: two renegade brothers, one slicker than snot (George Clooney) and the other a homicidal maniac (Quentin Tarantino) kidnap a former preacher (Harvey Kietel) and his two kids (Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu) in order to take their camper and flee to the Mexican border to escape the law. Stopping at a bar called the Titty Twister, they meet a trucker with an unusual gun (Tom Savini) and a fearless Vietnam vet (Fred Williamson), and together, the seven humans must battle bloodthirsty vampires who are in control of the bar.Predictable? You bet.There's not much to the plot. It's so cliched....so overused, that it doesn't really come across as anything exciting. But it is because of this fact that director Quentin Tarrintino is able to reveal his brilliance in filmmaking. His direction is moody and colorful--exactly what a vampire film needs-- with the monsters not even showing up until the second act, in Mexico. Therefore, because everyone knows this is a vampire flick, a lot of anticipation is built up. You want the vampires to show up, but you are also enthralled with the plotline that comes before it, setting all the stages up.The actors are also strong, as well as the characters that they portray. Not going too much into detail, this is exactly how characters from Pulp Fiction would respond if given the opportunity to fight undead monsters. Enough said. The three who come off the best are George Clooney, Quentin Tarantino, and Fred Williamson. Harvey Keitel also brings in his usual charm and Tom Savini of the Night of the Living Dead fame is interesting in a supporting role.But the best thing about this movie--and what separates it from other, better vampire movies is the vampires themselves. These are some of the most interesting ideas centered around vampires that I have ever seen. Never have they looked so horrifying or so nervewracking. With great gross-out special effects, this might be the first vampire film ever in which a vampire, having been shot with arrows and wounded, transforms into a giant, half slug-half dog and attempts to eat a human whole. It is absolutely amazing to watch, and I'm sure if Bram Stoker was alive, he would have watched it, rubbed his chin, and  'Wow. Why didn't I think of that?'Also amazing is the ideas used to kill the vampires. It's the usual stake-in-the-heart routine, but Tarintino aims for outrageousness and hits the mark right on the head. The ideas they use to kill these guys--and the vampires themselves for that matter-- are so original--so imaginative-- that you no longer care that this movie is cliched....you just want to see what happens next.This is a perfect film to watch if you just leave your brain at the door and decide to be entertained. It's probably the best vampire film to come out in years, and the most imaginative one to appear since 1979's Nosferatu. Give it a try, and enjoy!'Everybody be cool.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Great storytelling, no story
","**SPOILERS**Before I briefly state my views, I must confess that I have never read a word of or even picked up a Harry Potter book in all of my life. I had many friends rave and rant about them, and at my work, I often see my co-worker's kids sitting in corners, waiting for their mothers to take them to school, reading the latest chapter in the series enthusiastically. But because I have never read Harry Potter myself, I have no understanding of the series, the characters, or the plotlines outside of the world this movie has created. Therefore, this is a review for viewers like me: They haven't read the books, and they're curious to see what all the hype is about.Well....judging soley from this film, it's not about much, I can tell you.Overall, I would rate this film as either a C- or a D+. Since, if you're still reading this review, you've probably already seen the movie, I shall simply state my opinion without elaborating too much on the happenings of the film. There are a lot of cool ideas presented here....A LOT of cool ideas. In fact, I am not ashamed to state that every idea presented was involving and a work of genius....masterpieces to themselves. For the first hour, I was completely engrossed in the world that this movie had created...indeed, this was a magical movie. From the moving stairs to the floating candles and the interacting paintings, this was the stuff of a master artist. Just the goblins set the film apart....never have I seen a film-creature look so convincing.Unfortunately, after a while, the wonderful pictures get bogged down and dull due to the absense of a storyline. There was no story or plotline to give this film a firm foundation to stand upon....nothing to move these wonderful ideas that I was watching along. As a result, the move becomes a patch-work of cool-looking ideas, but with no backbone or soul behind them. Eventually, since there is no real storyline, the film just gets old and boring, regardless of how neat the pictures are. I wasn't the only one in the theater drawing these conclusions...indeed, about 90% of the audience were all children, and in the final hour, they were all chattering away to each other, ignoring what was going on in the film, and I could see the parents around them glancing at their watches.In the last twenty minutes or so, a plot is finally found, but it's so painfully contrived....so cliched and predictable, that it hurts to watch it (i.e. 'You defeated your enemy with love;' Harry's team winning all the points and earning the trophy, etc.).  This is a pity, because the plotline seemed to be good, and if the director had just cut the film's length in half and spent more time developing this story, we could have had a real winner on our hands, on par with other children's fantasys like 'Wizard of Oz' and 'E.T.'Veteran British actors such as Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, John Cleese, John Hurt, and Maggie Smith are wasted in throw-away roles, though the lead youngters certainly aren't bad.All in all, a dissapointing effort, made even more dissapointing by the fact that there were so many likable qualities to it, among them the ideas presented and the visuals achieved, which set it apart from any other film of its kind. Watching this film has not motivated me to read the books; however, I shall certainly be in line to watch the second film. Hopefully, with a better story for the viewer to follow, the visually and undeniably magical world of Harry Potter will be a truimph the second time around.*1/2 out of ****",1,9,22,18 November 2001
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Bram Stoker spinning wildly in his grave!
","It is called 'Bram Stoker's Dracula.' The title is deceiving.This film is an incoherent mess, to put it rather bluntly.The effects, which look beautiful, only take away from the story-- you forget that this is a vampire movie and you are left with an impression that it is a special effects promo. And for crying out loud, what is with that tagline 'Love Never Dies?' This film has taken a classic story and mutated it into a romance. Granted, there were huge romantic elements in the original Dracula-- the gothic horror classics such as it and Frankenstein flowed elegantly like poetry, and romance was used. But this film has taken something that Bram Stoker never intended and made it the key focus: Mina is now a riencarnation of a lover who Dracula lost while still Vlad the Impaler, and the whole film is basically an endless trek as they find each other and rediscover their lost love. OOOOKAY!As far as events in the book goes, it is pretty accurate, but that's not the point. The point is, they completely changed the focus on some kind of unnesseccary love story. If Coppola had made the film an accurate account of the legend, it would have worked great. If he had changed the title from 'Bram Stoker's', I might have liked it a little better (Even though the endless effects, as I have mentioned, made it mind-numbing and incoherent). Instead, it is only boring, tedious, and an insult to everything Bram Stoker hoped to accomplish. Poor Mr. Stoker....If he knew such trash like this would come out of his work, I'm sure he would have never written it.If you want to see a good Dracula film, watch the Klause Kinski version of Nosferatu. It certainly isn't faithful to the novel, but at least it doesn't PRETEND to be,  like this sorry excuse for a Dracula epic does.I would give this film a negative two hundred on a scale of one to ten, if not for Anthony Hopkin's brilliant performance as Van Helsing.

The Deer Hunter," Maybe the best film about the Vietnam War
","Most films depicting the Vietnam War asks the unanswerable question, 'What were we fighting for?' An intruiging question, no doubt....and one of which many excellent films about America's darkest hour has used as the premise. But what makes 'The Deer Hunter' such a masterpiece is that is doesn't seek to answer that question. Instead, it presents a new idea: 'When does the fighting end?'Robert DeNiro gives one of the strongest roles of his career as a common, ordinary deer hunter who goes to Vietnam and comes home a changed man. This is the story of his struggle, and it brilliantly shows what effects war has on people, and how the graphic images and experiences never leave the mind. This is one of the greatest examples of how war changes people, both the troops and their loved ones, and how it changes people in drastically different ways. Filled with so much symbolism that it bursts out in vivid colors, intense acting (Christopher Walken got a much-deserved supporting actor Oscar), and offering a superb character study, this is a film that is not to be missed. It also contains some graphic scenes form Vietnam that are not for the squeamish: the Russian roullette scene might be one of the most dramatic and heart-stopping war segments ever filmed.

The Matrix," WOW!!!!!
","'Wow' is all I can say about this film. It is visually incredible, and Keanu Reeves makes a nice Bruce Lee (ha ha ha. Those of you who saw the film will understand that one). With a million films coming out each year, it takes a lot to really impress me nowadays. Films need decent, original plots that have never been used before for me to even look at them. I reached this conclusion when watching such sci-fi classics as the Star Wars trilogy and the first Highlander film. I considered myself pretty spoiled, and after such high-quality films as those, few movies make my eyes pop. But The Matrix did. It's visuals are incredible, and it's cast and plot are so brand new and refreshing, I now consider myself truly thrilled by it. Why don't they make more movies this good nowadays?I won't reveal the plot, but I'll just say this: Nothing is as it seems. Nothing. You don't exist, and the world is run by robots.Confused? Go watch the movie and find out for yourself.I am convinced that if when movies first came out, and they had all the great technology back then that they have now, they had made the Star Wars trilogy, the first Highlander, and The Matrix, no other movie would have ever had to have been made. They are so superior, nothing could have ever topped them, so they shouldn't have even tried.The Matrix....One of just a handful of sci-fi masterpieces!",Null,0,0,21 May 1999
The Matrix," Overrated, but still a good flick for what it is.
","Like everyone else on the planet, when The Matrix first came out, I was blown away by the film. I thought it was cleverly written, with visuals that were mind-blowing, and the style was amazing. Immediately upon its release, it was being hailed as the sci-fi film of the 90's. At first, I was completely agreeing to this notion. Then I watched it again, and a funny idea occurred to me.The Matrix is really not very original. While it is a very entertaining film, originality is not one of its good elements. I like the film as an action picture now, but I certainly do not think that it deserves the title of issuing a bold new standard in sci-fi.There are a few reasons for this: first of all, Neo has little character development. His performance is limited to a series of 'Woahs,' and 'I don't believe it.' Case in point, Keanu Reeves did a good job in the part....an actor whose range is limited to Bill and Ted and, well...Point Break. That's because he had so little to do. Morpheus, Cypher, Trinity, Tank, and Agent Smith all came off much better than Neo.Second of all, the storyline isn't very original. Last year, I had the pleasure of watching Dark City for the first time. It flied vastly under the radar when it was first released, and it was certainly a quieter, more thoughtful film. It occurred to me while watching that the plot line, from the characters to the basic premise, is very much the same as in The Matrix, and it was released a year before. I'm sure you've all heard this argument before, so I won't go too far into it. But I will say this: Dark City, visually and story-telling wise, is a far superior film, IMHO. The complex themes that both film rises are better developed in Dark City as well. The Matrix seems to fall into the pattern of action movie in the final act, where Dark City maintains its deep philosophical elements throughout. I think it is a pity that The Matrix was able to set up such a realistic world that was so intruiging and inventive, and then push the audience into overkill by having the final third of the film being a long shootout/martial arts fight. Granted, it was the finest shootout/martial arts fight that I have ever seen in a film, but I felt that after it introduced all of its philosophical elements in the first two acts of the film, the final, violent act was rather mind-numbing and a shift in the wrong direction.That leads me to the action scenes themselves. So many have said that this film sets a new standard in sci-fi. I don't see this at all. The great sci-fis are followed by a series of rip-offs and films clearly inspired by them (Star Wars=Battlestar Galactica, Conan=Beastmaster, Alien=Creature, E.T.=Mac and Me, etc.). The Matrix has found few if any sci-fi films that have tried to rob it of its interesting new action style. Instead, its style has turned into a fad for action films that is quickly fading. After The Matrix, we saw a release of films such as Mission Impossible 2, Charlies Angels, Beowulf, The Art of War, and Mummy 2 that ripped off its style. And it is a style that is quickly growing old.The great sci-fis are usually films that are released before the general public is ready for them. The ones now considered classics opened to scathing reviews upon initial release, and many of them bombed at the box office. It was only audience reaction to them later that proved their worth and re-evaluation by film experts. The best of best were failures upon initial release--remember initial reactions to Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Alien, 2001, Blade Runner, Highlander, Dark City, and even Star Wars? These are now considered paragons of the genre. On the other hand, The Matrix did stupendous at the box office, and even went onto rival Episode One (an inferior film, by the way) at the cinema. I'm not so niave as to say ALL the good fantasy/sci-fis have to fail first before becoming great....Battlefield Earth and Lord of the Rings proves otherwise on both ends of the extreme. I am suggesting that The Matrix was simply a big, summer blockbuster which, because it had a plotline that appeared original because only smaller, quieter films had used it before, and because it had a lot of loud (but smart) action at the end that is appealing to the average moviegoer, was hyped up to be something greater than it really was.**1/2 out of ****",Null,0,0,26 April 2002

How, oh how, did 'Shakespeare in Love' beat 'The Thin Red Line' for best picture?I'm not sure. Perhaps people just didn't understand this film and dismissed it as a 'Private Ryan' wannabe. This isn't true. While 'Ryan' was an equally powerful film, the themes were much different. 'Ryan' had a single tone, and it followed it: Is the lives of eight men worth risking for the life of one? 'Red Line's' whole concept is, why are men evil enough for wars to even exist in the first place? From this point, it asks many questions: What is the value of human life? What are we fighting for? Is the enemy really evil, or are they just like us, fighting for their beliefs? In addition, it paints the picture of the war through the eyes of at least eight main characters, as they struggle through emotional turmoil.The cast is great. Malick's direction and script is perfection. The cinemintography is the best I've seen since 'Braveheart.' There is absolutely no flaws in the film, and from the character's private wars to the central themes, everything is played out with a touch of a master.Again to reiterate: How on Earth did 'Shakespeare in Love' beat this masterpiece? I'll tell you why: Hollywood is no longer comfortable with films about topics like this...It would rather settle for films about sex and false-romance over films about true sacrifice and humanity. And as long as Hollywood continues to think this way, more excellent films like 'The Thin Red Line' will miss the opportunity it deserves: the opportunity to be awarded for its greatness!****************************** out of ****",10,0,1,5 November 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," PROOF that sequels can be better....
","An awesome film. Where Star Wars: A New Hope was more of a space fantasy, this one is a lot darker and goes into much more detail. Introducing new characters (Lando and Yoda), and rekindling relationships with old ones (Han, Luke, Leiah, and Chewie), this is also a film about its villains (Vader and Fett).As I said on my comment of A New Hope, why go into detail about the plot? Everyone knows about it. But if you haven't seen it, do so. It goes lightyears beyond any film you'll ever see ever. If possible, skip the Special Edition. While it was a masterpiece, the old version speaks for itself, without anything enhanced.Superb!",Null,0,0,20 May 1999
