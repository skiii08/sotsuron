The Devil's Advocate," Absolutely Brilliant!!
","Exceptional. Simply perfect. I watched without blinking my eye for a moment until the end of the film, and the final literally shocked me. As it tells us the relationship between us and satisfaction & sins, it shows us our biggest weaknesses as people. This film makes you terrify and at the same time it makes you learn a lot. Acting is even better than 'magnificent'. Legendary is a way less description for Al Pacino, Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron are fantastic!! Excellent and unique. Anyone who doesn't watch this movie loses a lot. It just blows your mind! Seriously. It's one of the bests. Once you watch it, you will never forget about this movie. Ten out of ten.",10,3,4,31 July 2013
12 Monkeys," An Absolute Masterpiece.
","This movie has the power to drag you into the complication and the unpredictable incidents happening while the protagonist is trapped in different dimensions of time; you have to catch up with the movie because the clues, the connections and just everything needs you to follow with the flow of the puzzle waiting be solved completely, until the devastating and highly dramatic finale of the movie. This is one of Terry Gilliam's masterpieces and probably one of the best movies ever made. It is strong in every aspect; acting is just eye-fillingly amazing, just, everything in this movie is a perfect whole in its own way... A movie that needs to be seen more than twice. I repeat: Masterpiece.",10,1,1,22 February 2015
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," The Best Movie Of Tim Burton
","I can't find the words to explain my fondness to this movie. This is Tim Burton's masterpiece, a thrilling story with a chew-dropping ending. Certainly so gripping! Acting performances are fascinating, Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Alan Rickman with the other actors who are as successful as the lead actors are... And the best thing about the movie is the musical parts. All of the songs are magnificent, after I watched the movie I bought the soundtrack album and I've kept listening it over and over again since then. Johnny Depp really has the talent of singing, and Helena B. Carter as well. I gave this movie ten out of ten. Absolutely fantastic.",8,2,2,23 July 2013
Alice in Wonderland," Unfortunately..
","I expected more action and thrill before I watched the movie. I really like Johnny Depp, so I thought its a kind of great Tim Burton job, like his other jobs. But it is just a disappointment.. Sorry, Johnny :) I really got bored while watching the movie. I can't understand that why didn't Tim Burton find a better screenplay, Johnny, Helena, Anna and Mia is in, it's really great. But to tell the truth, in the end the movie didn't make me thinking, I said, 'What?' I mean, I like the old Alice more than this dark and unhappy one. I liked Mad Hatter and the Queen, I like the characters except Alice. She is the focal point of the movie but.. Oh, you got it. IT' A DISAPPOINTMENT..",7,0,2,12 November 2011
