Saturday Night Fever," Brooks--Saturday Night Fever Review
","Saturday Night Fever is no doubt a film that paints a portrait of what the urban setting in the 1970's was like. Issues of the 1970's, such as homophobia, rape, and suicide are present in this film. However, this makes the film better because it paints a portrait of the 1970's. As soon as the film opens and you see John Travolta strutting down the street, you know that this picture has something. Travolta portrays Tony Manero, a nineteen year old boy who works a dead end job at a paint store. He goes home and continues his dead end life because he fights with his family, especially his father, who is unemployed. When Tony is not fighting with his parents or working at the paint store, on Saturday Nights, he forgets his weekday boredom and is the hotshot dancer at the 2001 Odyssey Discotheque. While he is there, Tony sees a girl who lights up the dance floor just as he does. Tony eventually meets this girl, Stephanie Mangano (Karen Lynn Gorney). Tony finds out that Stephanie is a person totally the opposite of him. Stephanie is smart, mature, and hard-working. While Stephanie eventually accepts Tony's friendship, and tells Tony that she will be his partner in the dance contest at the 2001 Odyssey, she stresses that they will not be more than friends.A critical character in this film is Annette, who is played by Donna Pescow. Annette is a girl who will do anything to be liked by Tony and the guys in his group. Tony's friends (Joseph Cali, Paul Pape, Bruce Ornstein, and Barry Miller) are like Tony. They are immature and crude.I will not reveal the end to the film because it is a must-watch to anybody of any age who has not seen it. Travolta displays his best acting performance of his career in his first major film of his career. Even though there is a lot of crude content in this film, what you will remember is John Travolta lighting up the dance floor in his legendary white polyester suit. This film deserves a rating of 10/10 and is a must watch for anybody who has never seen the film!",10,0,1,2 November 2013
Taxi Driver," Brooks--Taxi Driver Review
","Taxi Driver was the film that made actor Robert De Niro, director Martin Scorsese, and screenwriter Paul Schrader household names. This film is a trip into one mans hell. The movie stars Robert De Niro as lonely ex-marine Travis Bickle. The movie takes place in New York, and the movie seems to act like a character. Right as the film opens as we see a cab drive through clouds and hear Bernard Hermann's wonderful score we know this movie will be a dark film.About twenty minutes into the movie, Travis meets Betsy (who is played by Cybill Sheperd). Travis is immediately attracted to Betsy and makes a great effort to be his girlfriend. Betsy plays a very key role in this movie because she is the one woman in Travis' life who he is close to, and even though she obviously doesn't want to be close to him, makes a heavy effort for her to be close to him.About forty-five minutes into the movie we meet Iris (who is played wonderfully by 12 year old Jodie Foster). When we meet Iris it is kind of a surprise, her walking in front of Travis' cab forcing Travis to slam on the breaks and right as he does this, Bernard Hermann's great score comes in. It is a jumpy moment and a strange way to introduce her as a character, yet this brief encounter makes Travis learn more about her.The ending is wonderfully done by filmmaker Martin Scorsese and Special Makeup Artist Dick Smith. It is a wonderful yet dark movie that will disturb some. De Niro gives a great performance in his second out of eight team-ups with Scorsese. A landmark in cinema and an unforgettable movie experience will make you want to watch this again. An important film. 10/10.",10,0,1,10 August 2014
Casino," Brooks---Casino Review
","Casino is one of the best films made by Martin Scorsese. Casino reunited Scorsese with Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Frank Vincent. Casino tells the tale of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (DeNiro) a New York bookie and his pal, Nicky Santoro (Pesci) who move out to Las Vegas and create an empire. However ones money hungry wife (Stone) helps to bring it down.The first third of this film features almost constant narrations from Ace and Nicky. These narrations play a great role in the film because it takes you far in depth to Ace and Nicky's Las Vegas operation.To those of you who really enjoyed Scorsese's 1990 film 'GoodFellas' there is no doubt in my mind that you will enjoy this film. It features Joe Pesci playing almost the same character he played in 'GoodFellas'. This film also features Sharon Stone, who was nominated for an academy award as hooker Ginger McKenna. The film also features Frank Vincent as Frank Marino, Kevin Pollak as Phillip Green, James Woods as Lester Diamond, and Don Rickles as casino manager Billy Sherbert. If you are a big fan of Scorsese, DeNiro, or Pesci you will no doubt enjoy this film. This film deserves a 10/10 rating and is a must watch for any DeNiro, Pesci, Scorsese, or mob movie fan who has never seen this movie.",10,1,2,21 February 2014
