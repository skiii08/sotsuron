3:10 to Yuma," 3:10 to Yuma (2007)
","I suppose it ought to said that I like westerns when they're done well. 'Unforgiven,' 'High Noon,' 'The Magnificent Seven,' 'Open Range,' 'The Searchers,' and I could go on a bit more. They share, for me, an exploration of character that the oater genre is perfectly placed to deliver because it's the culture where the influence of law is always five days away or right on the main street but incapable of providing the legal force and moral imperative needed. A man becomes judge and jury to fill that vacuum and, in the process, we get to watch the lines that define hero and villain shift and reform. But enough gobbledygook.Russell Crowe's Ben Wade is riveting. He's God and the devil, charming and menacing, petty and generous, and some other contrasts. Crowe develops Ben Wade into the man who slaughters his gang of cutthroats one moment, boards the Yuma prison train to pay respect to Dan Evans, and then whistles for his horse like the Lone Ranger summoning Silver to rescue him from the cliff face. Christian Bale is equally compelling as the rancher wrestling with his own set of values, a moral man needing to justify himself to the outlaw. In sharp contrast is the completely evil Charlie Prince. Ben Foster is two-gun Darth Vader; he owns every moment he's on screen. '3:10 to Yuma' is a visually appealing story, directed with understanding. It even has Peter Fonda showing his skills and not enough of beautiful Gretchen Mol. Unlike some, I didn't care much for Logan Lerman's William Evans. I guess I've seen enough of hormone-ravaged teenagers taking it out on their parents. This picture was so good, I went out and bought the Glenn Ford original and got to appreciate it all over again. Thanks, James Mangold; it was a great ride.",10,3,7,24 January 2008
Cloverfield," Filmmakers' joke on filmgoers.
","Viewers are entitled to be given something by a motion picture such as some insight into the human experience, a challenge to already held belief systems, or sheer entertainment value. The something viewers of Cloverfield are entitled to be given is a refund. Hand-held camera-work might provide the aura of realism in moderation; a whole film of camera-vibrato produces only nausea. A plot would have been helpful, but a going-away party for 25% of the film followed by a mysterious attack on New York by what for why, while girl bitten by spider explodes and severely injured rescued girlfriend races away like an Olympic sprinter on HGH, don't qualify. How about giving the audience some sense of what the monster is, why it's picking on the Big Apple (probably something to do with the Knicks), or a feeling of possible resolution? Nah; that would spoil their joke. Please don't give the filmmakers credit for Citizen Kane-like foresight into cinematic technique for their failure to provide even the most basic elements just because they fell in love with the video camera. Pocket the money and keep the 90 minutes. You'll never get them back if you go to see this Blair Witch clone.",1,21,41,21 January 2008
No Country for Old Men," Doesn't feel good, just feels right
","If it's a Tommy Lee Jones movie, I figure to get my money's worth in entertainment value. 'No Country For Old Men' gave me every penny back and some more. It is as though I felt it rather than saw it. Some titles seem added at the last minute--not this one. Ed Tom Bell, Anton Chigurh, Llewelyn Moss, and Ellis are proof that old men have been rendered obsolete and impotent by the violence and emptiness of the culture. Jones plays a man coming to grips with that reality while Bardem and Brolin play men who haven't begun to consider that truth yet. Character after character adds to the grit. Ellis and Carson Wells add some humor and insight, but you know there is no hope for them either. How about a madman who carries a compressed gas cylinder and has a man stand up willingly to take a metal rod to the brain? Even the border crossing felt real. And in the end does the SWAT team show up to save the day? That's not real so it doesn't happen. Who knows what happens to Chigurh as he walks away from the boys arguing about who lost a shirt? That's the feel of reality in a country with no room for old men. This is one of the most satisfying films I have seen in a very long time. The only weak spot was the off-screen death of Moss, but the Chigurh 'call it' encounter with the old man at the gas station more than covered the blemish.",10,0,5,22 January 2008
