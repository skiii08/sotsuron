Child 44," Child 44 review
","Some scenes are exaggerated, such as execution of the parents in front of their daughters, this might have happen back in 1917 - 1945, but not in 1953. Also if an officer would execute some like that he should of been extremely well connected with someone very high ranked the communist party to stay alive or keep his job. For sure, he would be send away for a while until everyone 'forgets' the incident. The military and police ranks are a complete mess in this movie. 1) No way someone carries an army sergeant rank in 1945 (Tom Hardy, Joel Kinnaman, Fares Fares) becomes an MGB captain (Tom Hardy) or lieutenant (Joel Kinnaman, Fares Fares) within 8 years. 2) Gary Oldman carries a colonel rank on his shoulder straps, but everyone address to him as a general, this is especially wrong because there was no general rank in USSR police force until October 23, 1974. They were called commissar first and second rank.",7,3,10,18 July 2015
