Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Saw an early screening
","My school showed a pre-screening of the movie tonight and I was one of about 500 people who came out to see it. Overall, the movie is very funny and will not disappoint. However, there are some scripted parts of this movie that I thought were not really that funny. The scripted parts are kind of necessary to drive the storyline I guess... Anyway, there is plenty of good ol' fashion Borat-style interviews and skits that really make the movie worth seeing. Any true Borat fans will not be disappointed, but I personally could have used a few more of his unscripted interviews. That is what Borat is all about! Let me just say this... At one point Borat has the balls of a 300 lb. man in his mouth. If that doesn't encourage you to go see this movie, I don't know what will.",8,2,10,10 October 2006
