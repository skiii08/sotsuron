The New World," This is how Hollywood ruins a movie. Hallmark postcard pictures and dreadfully loud and annoying music.
","If you want to see this movie I suggest that you turn off the sound. Everyone mumbles and the loud symphonic music makes no sense. Just a couple hours of pretty pictures. And not much historical information. Colin Farrell has one expression - depressed. Captain John Smith was and adventurer and explorer. According to this silly movie he was a depressed one. I couldn't understand a single word he mumbled, fortunately Pocahontas, for whom English was a second language had no trouble understand every word he said. This is a story rich with any number of angles but this is how Hollywood contemplates it's navel. Terrence Malick is credited with writing the movie script. I wonder what it must have looked like because the story in this movie could be told in a few sentences! And guess what! This movie was also directed by Terrence Malick and since he reduced a great story to a few mumbled lines he filled in all the time with long gazes at sun rises, sunsets, reflections on the water, the landscape, boats sitting in the water, Q'Orianka Kilcher in her native leather and Q'Orianka Kilcher in old English costume. Oh, and Q'Orianka Kilcher just has one expression as well - it's 'I'm concerned, sincere and pretty. And then there are lots of Native Americans who look as though the Hollywood makeup artist had way too much fun with the body paint!",3,6,11,24 August 2006
