Requiem for a Dream," OMG
","Do not see this movie if you don't want to be haunted by it for the rest of your life.  It really should be called requiem for a nightmare. 
It involves the nightmare situation of poor people who do drugs.  It is scary beyond belief and just so, so, so, sad.  The whole family (such as it is) gets torn apart.  The men and women in this movie have no power in the world, and their little fling with drugs costs them everything.Also the scene with the mother and doctor is a good example of the current scourge of doctors who just don't give a hoot about their poor patients. The inhumanity of man is pretty obvious in this movie because there is NOONE willing to help any of these people out of their plight, even though in some cases it would be pretty easy for some of these characters to help these people.The way that these people were mistreated in this film is what is the most disturbing of all.  Many of the characters surrounding these characters could have tried to help them, and the characters themselves could have done more to try and help themselves but they weren't strong enough for some reason.  And the cruelty of the police, the ex-boyfriend and the doctor were just appalling.",1,15,31,14 December 2003
50 First Dates," Nice Scenery, Pretty Good Story
","I liked this movie, it also has some really nice Hawaii scenery and real Hawaiins.  They also do some talking in Hawaiin. <p> I liked the animals in the movie. Adam Sandler & Drew Barrymore did a good job, Adam was actually a nice guy and Drew was prettier than I've seen her be in a while.  I loved the boat scenes, especially the end.<p> Although I'm not sure how likely it is that someone would forget everything after they go to sleep.  And I wondered why they didn't try some other things, but it was a good movie.  And I think the way the Dad and the brother were handling the situation was pretty realistic because I've seen families act like that.",8,0,0,28 February 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Beautiful! A Wonderful Adaptation
","I started to read this book when I was about 14 and stopped out of disinterest.  I reluctantly went to this movie after much urging.  I'm really glad I did.  In the first 10 minutes I knew I was going to love it. If you enjoy any sort of midieval world literature or movies you will enjoy this one.I have heard people complain that there is too much violence in this movie, however compared to today's standard I don't agree at all.  There were some fighting scenes but the blood and gore were kept to an absolute minumum. It does however have scary scenes.  I found it less scary than the first Jurassic Park.  For example you don't see anyone being bitten in half but you do see a disgusting monster get his head chopped off.  Which isn't the same because the dinosaur scene was the monster winning vs in the Fellowship of the Rings, the monster not winning (you want the monster to get his head chopped off not the other way around).The actor who plays Frodo is so wonderful!  He's so cute and his big blue eyes are so expressive I couldn't help but fall in love with him as everyone else does too in the storyline.  I would say all the actors were well chosen, although I would have liked to see the racist black vs white played down a bit.  All the black characters (as in evil black) were pitch black, not brown.  I would have liked to see more brown skinned characters in this movie instead of just white people playing all the parts.  It seems to me the wood elves would have darker hair, the wood elves in this film would have stuck out like a sore thumb in the real woods, they all had white blond hair.Cate Blanchette did a great job - she really seemed to have matured into this role.Elijah Wood as Frodo, & Iam McKellan was a great Gandalf - they  MADE this movie work beautifully.  I didn't even realize that was Iam McKellan, I thought it was Max Von Sydow!Liv Tyler was Arwen - she's not really the actress I would have chosen, she seems too passive and doesn't have much character, I would have expected an actress with more of an animated personality and who was a little stronger and not so bland.  She kind of stuck out like a sore thumb amongst all these other wonderful actors.  But she was okay she didnt' ruin the movie, she just didn't add as much as she could have.Sean Bean - was Sooooo good.  I loved the way he played this part.All the halflings did a superb job.  I loved Pippin he did well with a great part.  Merry was great too.  Sam reminded me a a labrodor retriever, kind of like he was supposed to, well acted.Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn was great.Hugo Weaving as Elrond was very good in a Star Trek kind of way.I loved the way they only did the special effects to a certain extent and did not soley rely on them to make the movie.  Having such good actors was more important.  But the special effects were great too.  Costumes were relatively simple in Hollywood terms but not inappropriate.Orlando Bloom as one of the Elves was better I thought in the 2nd part of the movie.  In the great council I found him rather annoying but he played a great elf the rest of the time.Christopher Lee was a great wizard, played the part well.John Rhys-Davies as the dwarve did okay, he had a kind of caricature of a role to play.  It's hard to tell if he did it well or not.  I suppose so.This film is so full of richly textured scenery and story that I wanted to see it again.  We went last night, maybe I'll go tonight too.",10,1,1,18 February 2002
28 Days Later...," Bad Bad Bad 'Omega Man' Type Movie
","This movie must be a sort of remake of the 'Omega Man' movie.  There's a virus, it infects people, making them into zombies that like to roam at night.  I wouldn't say this is an improvement on that movie.  There is no personality for one thing, at least Charleton Heston was an interesting person in Omega Man.The main characters do some annoyingly dumb things, like in all the formula horror flicks.The end is totally unbelievable.  I won't spoil it, but I will say that soldiers wouldn't be soldiers if they acted like that when faced with danger.Note:  I watched this movie almost entirely with the sound turned off so it wouldn't wake anyone up.  Most of the sound in the movie is zombies screaming.All the good comments on here must be from people who are connected to this movie in some way, because -- I'm sorry, but I just didn't see anything to rate this movie higher than a 1.",1,2,6,17 December 2003
School of Rock," Wow what enthusiasm!
","Good movie.  I loved the actors they picked, the music was great, the whole thing was very entertaining.  The only thing I didn't like was the fact that they had to make a movie about rock, because kids now don't know what real rock is.   Kids will love this movie too, mine did and it inspired him to go home and practice his piano.",9,0,0,19 October 2003
Moulin Rouge!," Beautiful Movie
","This film also has a great sense of humor, with green fairies, funny uses of familiar pop music, and lots of love & emotion.It is extremely beautiful as well as tragic.   I never thought I would hear an Elton John song again in a movie and they did the song better than Elton John did it himself.  (Makes you wonder if Elton John ruined other songs of his by insisting he sing them himself.)But anyway this is my second FAVORITE movie of all time.  My first being Betty Blue (37Â°2 le matin) which isn't out on DVD yet.Anywho this is a love story set in France at the Moulin Rouge, an infamous French dance hall (which was the first building in the world to have had electricity).  It is an amazing story in itself to read about the Moulin Rouge and Toulouse-Latrec a french nobleman with birth defects who hung out at the Moulin Rouge quite a bit despite his fathers wishes.  Toulouse-Latrec is known for his artistic posters, which he mostly drew at the Moulin Rouge. It almost seems as if the whole story is just a dream of Toulouse-Latrec's.The Moulin Rouge is the home of Satine (played by Nicole Kidman) who is a 'consort'.  The young writer falls in love with her despite her profession and she falls in love with him despite the fact that he is broke.  They have a 'forbidden' love because of several factors and try unsuccessfully to escape their lives, to make a new life together.The scenery is all at the Moulin Rouge mostly and it is beautiful.  There were also quite a few supporting actors and actresses who did a very good job.  The costumes made this movie.  I think without the sets and costumes this movie would NOT have been as good as it was.  It seems to me that instead of heaping ALL the awards on Buz Luhrmann, they should have been heaping awards on his wife, who did the set!   Also John Leguizamo was wonderful as Latrec, without Latrec this movie would be nothing.  Nicole Kidman makes a convincing prostitute, because she is kind of cold and distant, as you would imagine a prostitute would be.  And of course Ewan McGregor is really versatile and could probably play any part you gave him.  There was some real chemistry going on with Satine and Ewan, possibly enough so that it broke up Nicole's marriage to Tom Cruise, who she is better of without anyway.",10,1,2,15 December 2003
Bruce Almighty," Bad Movie Bad Movie Bad Movie
","Okay here's why this movie was bad:1. The character was supposed to 'not be an asshole', but really was a real jerk throughout the movie.2. The character Jennifer Anniston played was believable but sad.  Why on earth would she want to be with this guy, he was just a self absorbed jerk.3. There seemed to be not much 'helping' of others going on in this movie. Some bad events happened to people in other countries and stuff, and nobody around seemed to care at all, not God or anyone.  As if the characters and Buffalo NY were the center of the universe and who cares about anything else.Jim Cary was his usual funny self, but this movie just stank because it was just not consistent and Jennifer Aniston's character was just a prop.Get a clue people! Make movies where women have brains puh-leeze!  Women ARE smarter than you in real life so why don't you reflect that in your crappy movies?Oh and the ass humor never was funny, it is just gross.  Apparently noone has alerted the brain dead movie producers in Hollywood of this fact.BTW - It wasn't the acting - there are some good actors in this movie. It's the script!",4,2,5,25 May 2003
