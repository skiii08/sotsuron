Black Swan," Great movie
","It's a great movie with spectacular special effects; for example when Nina is in the presentation of the ballet and she goes to the bathroom because she has blood on one of her fingers, or when she is in her bedroom and she starts to scratch and you can see the skin peeling of her back. Another moment that I love happens when Nina is in the dressing room and she thinks that Lily is there, believing that her opponent wants to replace her, Nina tries to kill Lily. In my opinion this scene is incredible, not for the violence only, but because this is a part of her paranoia and we can't know this because there is nothing that makes us think that this is only her mind thinking and not the real world. Another thing that I like about this film is the end because it is different from the most of the films and when we think that the film is going to have a great end something happens in the last few seconds that change everything. Moreover, the actresses are really good especially Natalie Portman who also won the Oscar for her role in it. To finish with, I have to say that this is a film that after seeing, you are going to love it or hate it but you aren't going to say that it is in the middle.",9,0,2,2 August 2016
The Fault in Our Stars," A great love story movie.
","Firstly, this film is an adaptation of John Green's book. Before watching the film I read the book, and from my point of view, the book is better than the film because you can observe the little details quite a bit better. In this film we can also see the power of unconditional friendship and the importance of support when you really need it. The teenagers who fall in love in the film are called Augustus Waters and Hazel Grace Lancaster, and we can know that their love is going to be everlasting in spite of at the beginning we couldn't think it. If you have girlfriend or boyfriend this will be a very interesting film to see with him or her.",10,0,0,2 August 2016
Titanic," about movie
","This film is based on a real occurrence. In the story appears a poor boy, who is called Jack, and Rose, who is only 17. Both have a romance on the ship while it's being destroyed and sinking. Only some of the crew survived. On the one hand I think that the theme is good and very interesting as it is based on a real event, but on the other hand in my opinion it's too long and it can be boring. But if you like this type of film you will enjoy it all the time. In 1h 18m a servant from Rose is brushing her hair while they are talking, and this moment is very tedious. Although, in 2h 30m there are the best minutes as Jack and Rouse have their moment alone and they dance.",8,0,2,2 August 2016
