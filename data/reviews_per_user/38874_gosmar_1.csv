The Blair Witch Project," Oh my God!
","This is it! After 7 months of looking for a really good movie this year here it is! This movie is just great. Finally a great movie which stands for the art of film and for the horror genre. This movie will take you in to the woods, this movie will take you to the darkest places of your soul, places where darkness, pain, anguish and plain horror are real. O boy this movie is really creepy and a great feast to the senses! Way to go!",10,1,2,31 July 1999
