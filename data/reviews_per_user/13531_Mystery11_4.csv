Blade Runner 2049," Horribly slow and worthless movie...
","I think all viewers who rated it high are really high on ganja.
This is the slowest movie I've ever watched.
It's a one liner movie that's stretched to horribly boring scenes.
I went to lunch and came back and it was still the same scene.
Complete garbage movie.

Guardians of the Galaxy," Don't waste your money in the theater
","I don't understand why this movie has 8.5 IMDb rating. It's pretty boring movie. Acting is pretty lame. It's not engaging at all. Basically, if you are not under 13, you'll start yawning and checking your phone more than the movie.I felt like I'm watching a live play act rather than a movie. Direction, acting and animation felt like it was done by amateurs. I've seen better acting in a fan base remake of other movies and better animation in video game trailers. There are quite a few scenes where it's so dark that you can't make anything out. Storyline is very short and not enough for a movie. In the end, it shows that they will be back next time or something. I hope they don't as I won't be watching it, at least not in the theater anyways. Waste of time.",1,11,28,11 November 2014
Godzilla," Good story but bad lighting... whole movie is too dark, unwatchable
","Good story but bad lighting... whole movie is too dark, unwatchable. It is horribly black in many scenes, so dark you can't figure out if there is anything on the screen, just audio. What the hell was the director thinking? Movie story is okay. Fight between giant creatures.IMDb storyline pretty much tells the story.StorylineIn 1999, the Janjira nuclear plant was mysteriously destroyed with most hands lost including supervisor Joe Brody's colleague and wife, Sandra. Years later, Joe's son, Ford, a US Navy ordnance disposal officer, must go to Japan to help his estranged father who obsessively searches for the truth of the incident. In doing so, father and son discover the disaster's secret cause on the wreck's very grounds. This enables them to witness the reawakening of a terrible threat to all of Humanity, which is made all the worse with a second secret revival elsewhere. Against this cataclysm, the only hope for the world may be Godzilla, but the challenge for the King of the Monsters will be great even as Humanity struggles to understand the destructive ally they have.",2,2,7,27 August 2014
Incredibles 2," Another example of bad sequel...
","It was terrible to watch.
No story, nothing new.
Same old krap.
I finished it to see if it becomes interesting later but was a childish predictable simple plot that even a 5 year old could predict.
Don't waste your time.
Probably okay for kids.",2,1,8,27 October 2018
