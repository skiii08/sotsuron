Come and See," A Real War Movie
","When you hear a movie you're going to watch is a war movie, you expect exciting gun battles, spectacular explosions, and maybe a few depressing scenes towards the end that ultimately give you that warm patriotic feeling inside. In 'Come and See', you'll only see depressing scenes that will fill you with nothing but sorrow and anger.Of all of the holocaust/ World War II movies I've seen, nothing has made me feel such anger towards the actions of the Nazis like this movie has. Most war movies portray Nazis as mindless killing machines that are hard to hate since they appear to be the mechanical dogs of Hitler. In this film, the German characters had a real human side to them which made them much easier to hate when they would go out of their way to make sure Russian peasants suffered some of the most excruciating deaths possible for means of entertainment for the Nazis.Every character in this film is very real and the young protagonist will certainly leave an impression on you long after you have viewed this film. This is a powerful movie that will stick with you, but I advise the reader to watch it at a strategic time because it will definitely wreck the rest of your day when you see it.",9,2,2,29 May 2010
