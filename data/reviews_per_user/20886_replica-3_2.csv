The Blair Witch Project," Oh yeah!
","I think most people will agree that after seeing the Blair Witch Project multiple times, the scare factor dies down. But that's okay, because I'v found that after the 4th viewing, you begin to figure out the loose ends they didn't tie up. The point here being, that after the scaring is over, what really sets your hear off is thinking of what happens when he can't see anything. Little things that I dare not speak of because they would give the movie away. I suggest that you see this film multiple times. It gets better. Especially when you pay attention to detail and figure out little things.",Null,0,0,8 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Very good. A great start. But hard to appreciate.
","I think Episode 1 stands out as a great movie. But for a viewer who hasn't seen the first trilogy, or doesn't like them, will only enjoy the CG. And that is very amazing. But I think Lucas made the characters kind of cold for a reason. That is, this movie is a prep for things to come. What will Anakin's relationship be with Yoda, Mace Windu, or Obi Won? Or will there be one? Obi Won is a bit obvious. This film can only really be appreciated if seen as a so called prologue. So the bottom line is, was it worth the wait? Is it what the hype was? Well, for me it was, but I wasn't too sure what to expect, and therefore wasn't disappointed. For any Star Wars fan, this is a must see, and very good movie. A word of advice though. Don't believe what the critics are telling you. It'll will be different for every viewer depending on what they were expecting. And I think a lot of the true fans were expecting exactly what they got. Episode 2 is going to be real evil!!",Null,0,1,19 May 1999
