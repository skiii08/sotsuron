The Blair Witch Project," Read my lips: don't go camping
","I first heard about the Blair Witch Project a few months ago while looking at upcoming summer movies.  I read every article I could get my hands on.  I logged hours on www.blairwitch.com reading the (albeit falsified) history of the Blair Witch.  Now that the movie has come, I must say that it is even more frightening that I had expected.  The 80-something minute film is incredibly convincing, realistically acted, and truly terrifying (and even hilarious at parts).  It relies not on gore or escaped serial killers, but rather simple symbols like piles of rocks or a stick man hanging from a tree.  Everything in this movie works, from the characters to the jerky, low-end cameras (which immerse you even more, being a first-person point of view).  It sucks you in and doesn't release you until the last frame goes to black.Trust me, you will sleep with the lights on.",9,1,2,18 July 1999
