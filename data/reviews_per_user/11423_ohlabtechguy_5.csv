Vertigo," Dull and nonsensical!
","Just saw the 'restored' version of 'Vertigo' on video. Had never seen the movie before. First half was exceedingly dull as Jimmy the sleuth followed Kim on her aimless journeys. The pace and excitement picked up steam when Kim seemingly threw herself out of the missionary bell tower. But as the mystery unfolded, the plot and especially the ending scene where Kim falls again become so far fetched as to leave the viewer feeling like they had just experienced two HUGELY wasted hours. And Jimmy falling in love with Kim shortly after meeting her is both unethical and unbelievable. Afterall, he was hired by HER husband to follow her. And then he wastes no time making out with her and becoming obsessed with her after only a few short days. Totally UNREAL, especially for Jimmy who, as a star, is traditionally a thoroughly likable guy.The restoration effort turned out a beautiful product, full of color and clarity, and the movie serves as a wonderful historic insight into 1958 San Francisco, but other than that, this movie has to be one of Alfred's worst. Entertainment value is ZERO.OK...After reading some glowing reviews from other commentors, I just had to add a few more criticisms. Firstly, the scene where Jimmy falls off the step stool into Barb's arms is so MELODRAMATIC, namely Jimmy's facial expression, that it was laughable. Alfred should have seen how UNREAL and overdone Jimmy's expression was and changed it. I didn't buy it for a second.Secondly, though I like Jimmy Stewart, I found him unlikeable in this part. I cannot get past his UNETHICAL, UNPROFESSIONAL involvement with his friend's wife whom he has been PAID to follow. It's INEXCUSEABLE! And I'm a liberal minded person. Thirdly, Jimmy looked at least 25 years older than Kim. I find older men lusting after the young and beautiful to be both unsavory and undignified. Fourthly, Jimmy, though he's certainly old enough to be wise and experienced, was playing a stupid character who makes a lot of stupid mistakes. Kim, on the other hand, is practically a lifeless prop and a mere backdrop for Jimmy's inherent stupidity.Final assessment - There are no likable characters in this movie. The real Kim comes across as pathetic in her need to feel love at any cost and Jimmy is downright unlikeable. He's just dumb. Thus, no real sympathy is created for either character. My question becomes: HOW did any respectable and professional movie reviewer such as Ebert miss all this????",6,16,29,26 March 2007
American Beauty," Hollywood derives entertainment value from mental illness....
","Here we have yet another highly polished Hollywood flick that seeks to derive entertainment value by depicting two suburban families loaded with mental illness and/or behavioral disorders. Yet, the subject of mental disorders is not addressed and therefore, no meaningful message is given. Instead, the mainstream audience, not fully aware of signs of mental illness, are led to believe that characters with all the signs of mental disorder, are merely quirky, eccentric and at worst dysfunctional. Not a movie I would recommend and no meaningful message given. Hollywood just doesn't get it.",6,3,7,18 February 2019
The Exorcist," Hilarious thriller
","Just watched this on TV and found it very amusing. Not sure why they started the film in Iraq since I didn't think it added anything. Presumably an artifact that was found in Iraq was the source of the 'demons' that later possessed Linda Blair. The first half was a bit slow...nothing of interest started happening until Linda came down from her bedroom and urinated on the floor in front of her mother's guests. From that point on, it was one huge laugh after the next. The funniest part was where Linda would hurl green vomit at those unfortunate enough to enter her bedroom. This girl was so seriously possessed you wondered how anyone would dare enter her room, including her mother, who at one point was punched out by the 12 year old girl. Ellen did a great job at playing it straight....getting quite hysterical at times and showing great concern over her daughter's deteriorating condition. The movie was very well done and this is why it was so successful, but it didn't scare me. It just made me laugh. It was a hoot, waiting for each new shock that was supposed to just absolutely horrify the viewer. And all the while, you knew how fake and staged it all was.",8,1,7,30 January 2017
Call Me by Your Name," Way over-rated....
","I watched this thinking I was going to love it and cry a river after reading a bunch of reviews. First half was slow...slow, slow....and just when you think it couldn't get any slower....you guessed it...it got slower. I just couldn't buy the older handsome guy falling for the young skinny teen guy. And the whole relationship was completely inappropriate under the circumstances. In some ways, it was very realistically written and acted, but the degree of realism perhaps was more of a distraction. When the father has a heart to heart talk with his 'gay' and in love son near the end, I just didn't buy it. As a whole, his advice/comments didn't ring true. The writer didn't say what I would have said in a situation where I'm older and wiser and now have a lot of good advice to give young people. Not a happy ending, but probably a given due to the circumstances. Acting was good, but I was never drawn into any of the characters. I liked God's Own Country better. And it didn't get near the praise.",6,2,10,29 July 2018
Million Dollar Baby," This won movie of the year?????
","Unbelievable that this type of movie would win so many awards. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. The content was as depressing as depressing can get. And many parts of the movie were UNREAL; they didn't ring true. It was contrived dialogue and inappropriate emotions.Let's start with boxing. Boxing is a brutal sport and how anyone can get excited about people knocking the crap out of each other and risking serious injury is beyond me.Then the entire second part of the movie was about the fallen champ becoming a bedridden vegetable. Depressing all the way to the end! Of course, Clint wants to help her out of sheer guilt. So he somehow forces himself to pull the plug despite any legal consequences and despite the fact she IS conscious. Unreal. Didn't buy it for a minute.I also didn't buy her family. There are redneck hillbillies and then there are just people with absolutely no moral fibre, good judgment or sensitivity in their body. Her ENTIRE family was the latter. Nobody's entire family is that bad.Piece of contrived, depressing art is all this movie was. And I like Clint. My friend's Irish old dad is a dead ringer for him.",6,1,6,21 May 2007
