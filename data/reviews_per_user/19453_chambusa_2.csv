The Incredible Hulk," This reminds me of DOOM the movie. Fail.
","I'm writing this in point form because i think other reviewers can ramble on.I enjoyed the 2003 hulk. He honestly looked like a guy trying to never get angry. There was a good mix of action vs many different adversaries, easy to understand his rage, good storyline.There was a LOT of medical focus in this 2008 movie. At one point i almost turned it off. I got this movie for some action and plot line; i can watch CSI anytime! It's hard to say much without including spoilers.Edward Norton was a terrible actor in this movie; maybe because he can't play a good guy.The general feel throughout is about pain and suffering. There weren't many battles, and i found this to be one of those movies you can guess half of the story right from the beginning (maybe because of bad acting everywhere). That also might be why it's a different actor playing hulk.There was some great inclusion of old hulk things, story and other surprises; not that i care, but die-hard fans might enjoy.Let your friends rent it and watch it with them, save $4 :) Again, the best way to describe how i felt after this movie, was pretty much the same way i felt after DOOM the movie. I was excited going in, and couldn't believe how disappointing it was going out.",4,0,2,5 December 2008
Cast Away," The metaphor's used in this movie are great for making you reflect!
","I love how this movie shows just how good we have it today. We don't have to struggle for food, beg for water, or pray for fire. I didn't want to miss anything in this movie, because every moment of it was important. They did a very good job of making you feel his loneliness, and understand all the pain he went through.One part of the ending i enjoyed, was when he was at the crossroad trying to decide where to go. It both showed that nothing in this life lasts forever (his relationship with his wife), and that you need to keep an eye out to make sure you take advantage of what the 'tide will bring.' The ending was very sad, but also helps remind you of the important things in life that you have right now. Very glad i watched this movie, i learned some things from it !!",9,0,1,25 January 2005
