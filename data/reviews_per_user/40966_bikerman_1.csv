The Sound of Music," The full movie is much better than what they show on TV
","I thought I had seen 'The Sound of Music', several times in fact.  Really I hadn't.  I finally watched the film on video and found that what they show every year on television is not the real movie!  Significant scenes have been cut and significant lines of dialog have been removed from many scenes that they did include.  At least three of these cuts actually changed the plot of the movie.  I think the original makes MUCH more sense and is really a good movie.  Don't waste your time with the tv version anymore.",8,3,10,16 June 1999
