United 93," Excellent
","First, my prayers go up for the passengers and the crew and their families who survived them - and for their hijackers. It's the hijackers for whom I feel the sorriest because people who are so twisted by hate need the sorrow more than do the innocents they mass-murdered. The hijackers came from their world of so little love and kindness to mass-murder innocents who came from their worlds of genuine love and kindness. The telling difference between the hate-twisted, nihilist hijackers and the heroic passengers and crew is that in their attempt to save themselves the passengers and crew succeeded in sparing the lives of God knows how many more innocents whom the hijackers, had they flown into their target, would have also mass-murdered.'United 93' is the most harrowing film I've seen. Its makers relied as far as they possibly could on the documentary record of the event it depicts - on the facts, not on the paranoid, twisted, cynical, bigoted prejudices and predilections - and not on the cheap thrills and frisson of phony righteousness - of conspiracy theorists. Those facts include all that the makers could draw and glean from the tapes of the passengers' and crewmembers' in-flight telephone conversations and the background sounds they included.Cinematically this is a seamlessly tight, masterly treatment of real-time docu-drama. Top notch in my book.'United 93' ought to be shown, it ought to be required to be shown, in every American senior high school class. Now and forever.",10,5,10,7 September 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Brilliant, Haunting, Enduring Classic
","Twenty years hence no one will remember - let alone remember fondly - the juvenile tantrum of 'Crash'; but twenty years hence people will remember, and still more people will for the first time see and hear and be profoundly moved by, 'Brokeback Mountain.' In every way 'Brokeback' is a superior film; in every way it dwarfs all the other films of 2005; it's a brilliant achievement in timeless, enduring cinematic storytelling possessed of all the classical complexity and power of love tragically denied and self-denied and, ultimately, it ends with the beginning, the hope, of love redeemed.Ennis Del Mar - Ennis of the Sea - evolves, he changes for the better, he emerges, he moves from the inchoate, turgid soup of the sea to plant his feet on terra firma whence his love finds its roots and begins to branch out, to embrace his daughter's love for him and for her betrothed, and his love for them. Ennis holds onto, and the rest of his life's heartbeats depend from, the tragic talisman of his bloodied shirt, because it is his passport - and this enduring film's timeless, classical metaphor for tragedy - to the sublime which, in Jack's and his life, was not to be theirs.In twenty years time people will still be moved by, and they will continue to ache from and to love, 'Brokeback Mountain.'",10,35,41,13 May 2006
Closer," Painfully Pretentious Rot
","Tedious, painfully pretentious rot about four shallow, self-abased people self-deluded and made miserable by their pursuit of rutting and by their crippling nonsense of their self-importance, self-involvement, and self-gratification (perhaps the result of education having abdicated its 'mission civilisatrice' and descended, from the early 1970's, from educating to the mistaken imbuement of - ahem - self-esteem).The characters exist in a rarefied state absent of family, friends, coworkers and, for that matter, the whole, real world. 'Closer' is really Farther - from each other as whole, thinking, feeling humans. 'Closer' redeems nothing and no one, unlike the still-reigning champion of human relationship films: 1963's 'This Sporting Life.'Is there a rating lower than Zero Stars? - because that's what I'd consign to this from-the-get-go crippled film which seeks, it seems, to cripple others by stabbing them in the face with its paean to self-gratification. Closer' is a reductio ad absurdum of human complexity because it cannot get over its own sophomoric nonsense of humans as purely carnal animals existing solipsistically in a noxious bubble composted of their self-important, shall we say, bovine excreta.",1,5,10,2 April 2005
K-19: The Widowmaker," Solid Effort That Will Improve Over Time
","The problem with this solid story is that, pre-release and upon premiere, it was oversold as a blockbuster. Of course, as do so many films about America's military which purport to depict a historical event, the story was overlaid with the unnecessary and false dramatics of the skipper vs. executive officer command-style conflict, a burdensome device which only detracted from the terseness and impact of the central drama.Instead of that ersatz melodrama I expect K-19 would have benefitted from a bit more character revelation of the junior officer and enlisted crewmembers. For instance: we never find out how the poor man whose hand got pulped in the torpedo hoist chain comes to fare: a little vignette of a buddy visiting the injured sailor in sick bay, perhaps talking wistfully of their sweethearts or wives and children, would have served the story much better by foreshadowing and mirroring the plight of their later-crippled vessel.Harrison Ford serves - I can't say 'acts' - well, if not splendidly, in the role of a Soviet sub captain: he portrays a stolid technician-cum-ideologue humanized by his experience aboard K-19, and who is disillusioned yet reconciled by his ex-crew to professional pride at the story's close which occurs after the demise of the Soviet Union. Liam Neeson is fine as the sub's executive officer, despite his having been burdened with the unhistorical plot conflict between his character and Ford's. The other actor hobbled by Hollywood's insistence on showing the rabidly political Nazi officer stereotype was, in this case, the poor guy who had to play the spineless party commissar: let me assure you that party commissars for service aboard Russky nuke boats were not chosen from the ranks of the wishy-washy or the ideologically dubious.Though it's used here as a drama-heightening device, whether, or not, the sub's nigh-melting-down nuclear reactor would actually have caused the vessel's nuclear armaments to have detonated is immaterial: the core of the story is the self-sacrifice of the crew volunteers who deliberately exposed themselves to lethal overdoses of gamma rays to save their shipmates.Whether, or not, sailors are warriors or merchant mariners, their first battle is always with the sea - a battle that often involves sailors having to live with the consequences of the feebleness of marine engineering pitted against the vast, pitiless environment in which their technology must sail...and survive. This is the heart of the story of the 'unsinkable' RMS Titanic, and it's the crux of the story of K-19: human frailty and smallness versus the implacable sea - and equally implacable physics.There's one glaring blooper. When we first see Harrison Ford's character uniforming himself, detraining in the Moscow railway station, and climbing the grand staircase of the naval headquarters, he's wearing on his greatcoat the shoulder board insignia of a Captain Second Rank. Immediately after ascending the headquarters stairs, when Ford's shown in the headquarters room getting his orders from the admirals and the Red Army marshal (played by Joss Ackland), he's wearing on his reefer jacket (which is worn under the winter greatcoat) the shoulder board insignia AND the cuff rank lace of a Captain First Rank. In the next sequence - his arrival on the Kola Peninsula to take command of K-19 - his shoulder board insignia have magically returned to those of a Captain Second Rank. Considering that the DVD of K-19 contains a special feature devoted to the production's attention to details - which were in all other respects lavish, accurate, and pleasing - this insignia blooper is cruelly obvious.K-19's central 'character' profits also from extensive cosmetic and seaworthy conversion from a smaller ex-Soviet sub to mimic the dimensions and profile of the real K-19: a costly but worthwhile expense that delivers realism unachievable with CGI.Overall I liked the film and its central narrative and how it was told; and the storytelling provoked me to sympathize with the plight of K-19's crew and to admire their humanity, comradeship, and heroism. I expect this is one of those films that's underappreciated at its debut, yet one which will earn its due of greater acclaim in later years. Kathryn Bigelow's direction is surehanded at K-19's documentary style and at its larger, more sweeping cinemaphotography (composition-in-frame is quite good actually as seen, for examples, in the pre-launching and christening scenes), and I hope she will make more films I shall enjoy seeing. Of ten stars I award it seven.",Null,0,1,11 September 2003
Cinderella Man," Perfect Picture Packs Potent Punch
","First, kudos to the casting of 'Cinderella Man' - visually and vocally every actor in this movie looks and sounds like the Depression survivors I knew when I was a kid in the 50's. This wasn't Russell Crowe's or Ren√©e Zellweger's, Paul Giamatti's or Craig Bierko's movie: it's a magnificent achievement made magnificent and unforgettable by every actor in it.Second, this is by far Ron Howard's best film; and in every respect it's cinematically perfect. Only God knows why at Oscar time the Hate America First left-liberals in the AMPAS looked away from this unsurpassably splendid work of art.Third, there are only two boxing films that show ring blows as they look and sound - and must feel - like in the flesh: the uplifting 'Cinderella Man' and the depressing 'Raging Bull' - and both films succeed brilliantly at communicating what they set out to do and to tell - only the individual viewer can choose which film best imparts the same lessons about what it means, and about how best to be, human. My father took me once to a boxing night and, though before that night I'd seen boxing on television, up close to it I was sickened by the vicious, unremitting violence of the contests; having seen those fights up close I'm fully aware that 'Cinderella Man' pulls no punches in depicting, in making the viewer feel, the harrowing, punishing violence that two men wallop into one another in the ring. Yet I have to observe that boxing was and is still with us, and thus a subject worthy of 'Cinderella Man's' awesome cinematic treatment of it. With every blow missed in 'Cinderella Man' I ducked, and with every blow that connected I flinched, cringed - and I wept that two men could, and would, pummel each other with such singleminded ferocity. But here, in and out of the Depression ring, that's the point for Jim Braddock, the point the audience cannot mistake: a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do for them that he loves, and a woman's gotta do what woman's gotta do for the man she loves.I can't sufficiently praise 'Cinderella Man' except to say that it proved to me that Ron Howard can, and did, make a movie like they used to: straight from the shoulder; gutsy; powerful; adult; and with all the grit and grace, sophistication and splendor of films from Hollywood's Golden Age. I feel that Howard and his entire team may have even raised the bar above the Golden Greats and in doing so, their achievement perfectly reflects Braddock's achievement in the ring and in life.",10,0,1,28 March 2006
