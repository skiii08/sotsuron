National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Where is the third part ?! I need to watch it now.
","The first question pops up in anyone's mind before watching the sequel of a movie is, will it be better than the first one or not ? Probably this is one of the few movies that their second part is better than the first, but not in all aspects, this one is funnier, has better puzzles and mysteries,more characters are involved in addition to more countries and places which means more thrill, more gadgets and technology stuff, the enemy here has unjustified actions, the story suddenly turns to be a treasure hunting with a weak plot.If you liked the first one, you will definitely like this one, and no need to mention that Nicolas Cage did a great job here too.Finally, it's a great thrill/action movie, which is better than the first one is some aspects and it really needed a third one to answer some of the unanswered questions.",7,0,0,2 September 2018
10 Cloverfield Lane," Everything is Explained, or Not ! or May be YES, or Not !
","Is is an ordinary kidnap movie ? or Is it another aliens invasion movie ? Could it be about a psychopathic killer ? What if you have a movie that has all the three attributes ? Welcome to 10 Cloverfield Lane.The movie starts with the scene of 'Michelle' leaving her fiance house in scenes relatively empty of people which should ring a bell, in addition to the scene of Glenvagulin that we will see later in the end. Then moving to the car accident scene and the first appearance of our kidnapper/saver that will lead to more complicated actions.The beauty of the movie is the fast transition between the end of a plot and the start of a new one, and this continues throughout the movie till the very end. And the good thing for open end movies haters that everything is explained but this didn't affect the thrill dose.The director did a great job in keeping you in such tension and suspense without extreme action, and with these few actors in that tiny bunker. Also 'John Goodman' really nailed it and his acting was superior to the other actors.It's really good to see how could a shelter look like in case on a disaster, with that much of books , movie discs, sound discs and little food relatively.At the end, it's a great movie that deserves to be watched with great attention to every detail that will not make you bored at any moment.",8,0,0,22 June 2018
Catch Me If You Can," A pure definition of entertaining movie.
","This movie simply combine all the factors of a successful movie, like talented actors, great directing, fascinating 60's scenes, catching story and happy ending.I believe this movie should remain in the memory of everyone who watches it, and it has to be watched by every interested person in movie making. The brilliance of Spielberg meets the talent of DiCaprio and Hanks to come out with that masterpiece.You will enjoy each and every aspect of that movie, you can watch it in whatever mood you are in, and still you will see the beauty in it. You may even watch it more than once and you will never get bored of it.Finally, watch it now.",10,1,2,4 January 2018
Wind River," The movie with no single smile.
","In some hot days, we need such cold movies to let us forget some of the torment of the sun. The movie highlights the situation of people living in such conditions like the difficulties of transportation, the marginalization of native Americans, and the issue of missing women in that demographic.The rhythm of the movie is really slow, it starts with a scene of running woman in the snow then everything will be explained in a good sequence. The cast was really good specially the beautiful performance of 'Jeremy Renner', he fits really well in the role and you will see him in some dark dramatic scenes that he mastered.However, i have a problem with 'Elizabeth Olsen's' baby face, she is a great actress but not for a role of FBI agent. The officer 'Ben' and all other short period showing characters were good.The white costume of 'Jeremy Renner' resembles a lot the costume in snow scene in 'Inception' movie. Finally, it's a drama/crime movie that you will not be happy after watching it, it's really dark and cold, you can see that on the faces of the characters which i think they never smiled through the movie.",6,3,8,20 November 2017
Shaun of the Dead," An Average Sarcastic Zombies Movie.
","This movie is kinda the start of non told series of movies which is the result of cooperation between'Edgar Wright' and 'Simon Pegg' , The next movie in the series is 'Hot Fuzz' and then 'At World's End'.It's better not to compare any of the movie in the series with each other, because they are separated story wise. But the similarities include, the same directing team, almost the same actors team and the same genre.I saw it as a sarcastic movie about the Zombies idea, the scenes and the comedian parts weren't that funny. But the good thing that they kept everything simple, the idea is simple, the make up and eye lenses of zombies are simple, the killing scenes and the places included are simple, so everything was clear to the point.Finally, it's a good comedy zombie movie that can get you out of a bad mood although it has some points that may get you bored.",5,2,4,27 January 2018
Hot Fuzz," Funny, Light and Entertaining Masterpiece.
","The beautiful cooperation between 'Edgar Wright' and 'Simon Pegg' in writing this movie had the effect of magic on it.This movie showed that British can make a funny and entertaining movie without further complications either in the story or even the action scenes. You will find good story, great acting, new and beautiful shooting angles , spectacular directing and of course lovely comedy.Finally, it's a beautiful movie if you are looking for a fun story with a little twist that you will not get bored easily of it.",8,0,0,27 January 2018
The Mummy," Beautiful rememberable and remarkable adventure classic.
","When this movie was released, i remember it was a big thing so i decided to watch it again in 2018 to see if this hype was real or not.Surprisingly this movie is really great, it tells a very simple story but with very complex sub-stories and detailed adventurous journey that combines between British, American and Arabic style of fights, motivations and culture.Of course there is a drawback in moving that Arabic culture to the screen, as you can see there is careless in delivering an accurate culture, language and accent.'Brendan Frazer' plays the main role here and I can't imagine someone other than him, he was just born for this role. He did well in action, romance and even silly situations. All other actors did great as well but their performance was not remarkable as 'Brendan Frazer'.All scenes are catchy to the eye, the director showed a few shadows scenes which were great. If you watch it in 2018, you will not feel that it's old or outdated.All the make up and special effects scenes are perfectly done. You will see magnificent scenes of Ancient Egypt and its treasures.Finally, it's a great adventure movie that is not comparable to any other movie that represented the idea of Egypt's treasure hunting, it's funny, light and you will not feel bored here.",8,2,3,6 September 2018
Zodiac," Is there any better place to get continuous thrill for almost 160 minutes ?!
","This is a movie about a real serial killer, and it's not like any other serial killer movie, the geniality mainly comes from its multiple plots and its endless questions and suspense.You will be well entertained with the acting, the 60s and 70s scenes with the pale colors of photography which will make you feel its reality, and the great group of actors which did a great acting that was suitable for the atmosphere of the movie.Finally, it's one of the best drama/thriller movie you will ever see, it's about 160 minutes in length so you may want to cancel any important appointments you have before starting it, and you will definitely not feel bored any any second.",8,0,0,12 July 2018
The Town," The details are what matter here.
","This is a movie about a group of thieves in a town of bad history about thieves, and of course we see their interactions to the surrounding community, the police and the victims of their heists.But the story is not the core here as it's very simple related to other heist related movies, however the excellency of this movie stems from paying much attention to the details; the details in the accent of 'Charlestown' citizens, the details in the costumes which made for us that unforgettable scene of the robbing nuns, the details in making such strong plot with the least weak points.The length of the movie is a little bit extended without any good reason, it starts well with a great action scene then the rhythm goes up and down till you reach the end which may not be liked by a lot.The performance of the actors is really great and you see them in new characters and they nailed it specially 'Ben Affleck' & 'Jeremy Renner'. On the other hand, 'Rebecca Hall' & 'Blake Lively' could do better and 'Jon Hamm' didn't fit that much in the role.Finally, it's a nice crime/drama movie that the director -who is 'Ben Affleck'- paid much attention to everything except for the thrill which could be added in a bigger amount here,you will enjoy it till the end if you overcome some boring moments.",7,0,1,15 July 2018
Knowing," This movie tried to make everything and succeeded in none.
","A good movie usually starts with a simple idea and builds on it to show us how this simple idea can be brilliant.Unfortunately this movie started very well and was promising till you reach the second half, it started to add a lot of challenges that it wasn't up to them.The apocalypse idea with the numbering dilemma would be perfect, but they just added a lot of unneeded drama, disasters' scenes, aliens/spiritual creatures and unrealistic mathematical theories.So they tried to stuff the movie with a lot of elements that didn't work well together, but this didn't kill a lot of the enjoyment of the movie, what really did are the special effects scenes of disasters that looked really cheap.The characters were introduced well, their reactions were not to the point all the time, the plot keeps moving from time to time so you may get lost finding the real one.The music is not felt here, the script and scenario are quite predicted, the sign language was better here specially the one near the end.Finally, it's an average movie with a lot of categories involved, 'Nicolas Cage' had a rigid reaction on his face throughout the movie, so just watch it if you are excited about the idea only not anything else, and you will not get bored easily here.",5,0,1,4 September 2018
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Great idea led to funny and pleasant movie.
","This is one of the old/new comedy classics with a great genuine idea that cared a lot about the details of the life of our 40 years old virgin guy.The comedy here is mixed between funny situations ,funny told jokes and sarcasm between the characters and it's really written and played well.The actors fit perfectly and added a lot to the comedy by their performance.The movie follow a single pathway about the life of our guy whom background was introduced smoothly and briefly, and it shows his journey trying to achieve his goal driven from the pressure of his friends.Finally, it's a great comedy movie with lots of funny situations and jokes, it will do its part of making you laugh out loud many times, and no need to mention it's not for you if you are less than 18.",7,0,1,16 July 2018
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Amazing Story But....
","I decided to watch this movie after i saw the high voting & the recommendation reviews, and guess what.....it really deserve it a lot. I watched it in home as DVD with Full HD which made the experience much much better. The movie has really fast start & the sequence of action is really fantastic & u never wanna the movie to end. The customs , the colors, the actors , the decor & the whole theme of movie is amazing. I just gave it 9, may be because it's quite expected end & the sequence has just stopped suddenly at the end which was sad. Great thanks to who ever brought such an amazing movie into reality. They also grabbed a really good bunch of actors with amazing performance.Overall it's a must watch movie, enjoy this one of a time peace of art.",9,1,3,28 July 2014
The Lives of Others," At the end, Humanity will dominate the Professionalism.
","A winner Oscar movie sometimes is overrated by critics or excited audience, but this is not the case here. For more than two hours,you will go in a journey of one of best dramatic & thrilling adventures of the secret police of East Germany 'Stasi'.The movie start with an investigation scene of a suspect by a 'Stasi' officer 'Gerd Wiesler', then he tries to move his ways of investigations to his students in order to be great 'Stasi' officers.He will move to the surveillance of 'Georg Dreyman',then the events follow in a great sequence while we are watching how the power can control each element of the society,how it can be misused to achieve personal interests and how the opinion of power holders can be wrong.The most stunning thing you will watch in the movie is the perfect acting of 'Ulrich Mühe' who plays the role of 'Gerd Wiesler' the 'Stasi' officer, he really nailed it in every small detail in each corner of the character, his rigid non smiling face throughout the movie makes you believe he was a former 'Stasi' officer.Finally, it's one of the best non-English speaking movies, it tells the story of the conflict between East & West Germany in a simple way. It's a beautiful drama/thriller movie that will not get bored watching it more than a time.",10,1,2,8 December 2017
A Quiet Place," Just Shhhhhhht !!
","First of all, this is a new experience to watch a movie that is 90% silent without background music nor speech between the characters. But for a reason we have five senses, and you may not feel very comfortable about neglecting the sense of hearing and its great effect on our fusion with the movie.So it's a very slow, silent movie with minimal script - the funny thing is that three writers wrote the screenplay only- , the movie runs in one line about the journey of the family trying to survive from that monsters, which were specially designed to serve the point of view of the writers that i find them the silliest monsters ever. The family divide and reunite repeatedly throughout their journey, the faces of the actors is really cold and rigid which is a good thing to reflect the condition of worry and fear, except the always crying look on the face of 'Emily Blunt' which is the same look she copies from her previous movies.Finally, it's a movie about the idea that director needed to execute it regardless the outcome, the suspense is at its lowest levels in addition to the horror which was absent here. The monsters are not genuine and they look outdated, and you will definitely feel lost and bored while watching it.",2,4,7,26 June 2018
The Mummy Returns," Definitely worse than the first one, but still entertaining.
","When comparing it to the first one, we find thay this one has less adventures, less fun, less mysteries and tricks, less magic, worse visual effects, more fights specially one vs one fights, more mummies count but less in diversity, more kisses, more enemies, more weak and unexplained motives of some of the characters, weaker plot, but all of this didn't prevent it from being a good entertaining movie.Some of the elements in that movie were copied from the first one and they tried to enhance it but the result wasn't that good, such as the bugs, the mummies, and Im-Ho-Tib who transferred from being the most invincible mummy to a normal human being who can make a conversation and has feelings as well.There's a reason of why this sequel stopped, moving from a great movie in the first part to a good one here is probably not the main one, but i believe having a third one would give the creators a chance to over come all the problems that appeared here but unfortunately this didn't happen until late.Finally, it's another good adventure classic, you will have a chance to watch another beautiful scenes of Ancient Egypt and its golden treasures, and you will never be bored while 'Brendan Frezar' is on the screen.",7,0,0,8 September 2018
Life Is Beautiful," The beautiful integrated movie.
","This movie is far beyond our normal rating and categorization, actually you will find a mixture of drama,comedy,war,history,romance,and even thrill. It's indeed one of the most integrated movies i have ever seen, not only for the mix of genres, but also for the mix of deep feelings you will feel during watching this movie,not to mention that it will get tears out of you.You will touch the real hands of hope in this movie,the hope in the darkest situation,the hope even when your dearests' lives are at stake,the hope that give you the ability to smile to your son while you are in the Holocaust,the hope that drive you to protect your beloved ones even if you have to sacrifice your life.One of the great points 'Roberto Benigni' showed in the movie, is the real love between his family,i believe the relationship between 'Nicoletta Braschi' and 'Roberto Benigni' in real life had a great impact on the movie,specially the real smile 'Nicoletta Braschi' showed every time her husband looked at her.Being the leading role actor and the director of the movie is not an easy thing, but our hero 'Roberto Benigni' nailed it here, not to mention that he is one of the writers too.The movie events can't be summarized in a simple review,but basically it's about an Italian man marrying a woman,and they live happily until the German forces lead them towards the inferno of Holocaust.Finally, it's one of a kind movie,it really deserved the Oscars, and i'm sure you will not get bored watching it till the end with its unexpected turnovers throughout it.",10,0,0,29 November 2017
National Treasure," Highly recommended if you missed the golden era of Nicolas Cage.
","This is a highly enjoyable movie for all ages without any complex ideas nor twisted unneeded twists. It starts with a flashback scene that opens the gate for the sequel of events about a treasure hunting.The good thing about this movie is the simplicity about everything; the characters and their backgrounds which were funny, light and introduced well but not to a degree that makes you get attached to them emotionally, the plot and the storyline which is related to something kinda real that gives a feeling of excitement to explore more, this simple flot had some weak points of unexplained events or actions without any realistic justifications.The chase scenes are well made but not very special, the puzzles are exciting, the script has its beautiful moments, the actors added a good soul to the characters, the music is enjoyable and fit to the atmosphere of the movie.Finally, it's a good thrill/action movie with a great performance of Nicolas Cage that made a great treasure hunting sequel, so make sure you watch part two afterwards.",6,4,5,2 September 2018
American Made," There is something dirty behind everything American
","The 'Based on True Story' statement is not so true in that situation, it can be considered as inspired only from Barry Seal real story, in addition it's not a real classical Biography movie, also a lot of details in that movie about the life of Barry Seal are not true,So we come to a question, Is this movie to improve the picture of a corrupt pilot who used every situation in his life for his own benefit ? or Is there any hidden message the movie makers want to deliver ? or Is it the image of the American Hero whom we should look forward at ?The major differences between the real life of Barry Seal and the movie are:
-He was recruited early in life before joining TWA by different governmental agencies to transfer guns to Cuba from CIA and he did flying operations for U.S Army before Vietnam War.
-He didn't resign from TWA but he got fired for falsely citing medical leave and was arrested for trying to fly plastic explosives.
-No Schafer or Monty in real life.That was story wise, but about the movie it self it was below the expectations, the spirit of Tom Cruise is the only thing that will make you continue watching it. Finally,it's an average somehow action movie with good ups and downs but i think it's a little bit elongated. You may enjoy it if you just love Tom Cruise regardless any other component in the movie.",6,0,1,3 January 2018
Joker," After the hype, all will remember Joaquin Phoenix, forget the Joker.
","In order to properly review this movie, you have to isolate yourself, forget all the hype, and watch it as psychological drama movie.Is it the best movie in 2019? Is it one of the top 10 movies in the history of movies? No, re-watchability is a major key here to get a yes in the previous questions, but I believe it's so hard to re-watch this movie again. It's so dark, depressing, not true and showing the human soul in surrendering positions most of the time.'Joaquin Phoenix' did the role of his lifetime in this movie, and Oscar is granted here. Flawless performance, amazing facial expressions, beautiful body reactions and great joker make up and hair style. It's one of the most beautiful make up for the joker character in the movies.But, where are the scars? Shouldn't be some scars on the face of joker? I don't know if people missed this or our 2019 joker is scar-free one and all the scars are psychological and in his soul only.All the actors did a great job here but no one can beat 'Joaquin Phoenix'. But the great thing that all of the characters are well written, even the smallest role had great lines.The cinematography and videography are great here, beautiful coloring and camera angels. The soundtrack is catchy and adds to the atmosphere of the movie.Finally, it's a psychological movie, not about depression mainly but can get you one if you have a weak heart.",7,1,3,12 October 2019
Dark Shadows," Weak Plot, Weak Story, Nice acting and beautiful atmosphere
","I wonder how would this movie survive without that team of actors specially
'Johnny Depp' ?! This is a good fantasy movie without anything genuine, the idea of Vampire and its interaction, the witch and its classic evil character,the mysterious goal of a ghost, and a lot of unexplained events.You will enjoy that movie to an extent, you will get involved in the atmosphere of 1750 and later in the dark environment of 70's, the movie starts well and get your attention in the first half hour then you will get a feeling that another writer got involved suddenly.You will know a sufficient background about the characters, and you may think that the events will follow a specific pathway but you will get surprised a little with the turnovers.The supporting roles are quite a lot here but they didn't add much to the movie and their effect on the events is not that much because everything is about 'Johnny Depp' which is not very good thing because that team of supporting actors has much talent that needed to be shown on the screen.The plot of the movie is the weakest point and you will feel a lot of stuff are not explained well, that may be annoying to you.Finally, it's an average 'Johnny Depp' movie which i believe he should have his own category, it has good fantasy and weak comedy, and you may feel bored a little but try to overcome that with the music which will keep you alert.",6,0,0,14 July 2018
Mother!," Warning! Warning! Warning! Over Symbolic Movie Ahead!
","Before watching this movie,you have two options, either to read a good brief and explanation about it,or to watch it till the end and read the explanation afterwards. In both cases the results will be the same,you will feel the same in both situations and you will get easily into that dilemma.The main question is WHY ? Why did the makers of the movie decided to do it ? What's the point of storytelling a well known story ? This can be justified if there was an element in the movie with superiority,but there is nothing. The amazed look on 'Jennifer Lawrence' face -which is stuffed in the movie ,the poster and the trailer- will catch you from the first moment you play the movie and will move on.It's one point of view of the relationship between 'Mother Nature','God','Adam & Eve','Jesus' and Humans. And this point of view is not a fact,so not everyone will agree about the idea of the movie. The videography that shows us the scenes in 'Jennifer Lawrence's' eyes is good to an extent, in addition to the very close shots to the faces of all the characters is something you may not like.The movie is dark most of the time and will let feel unpleasant or uncomfortable.Finally,it's a pure symbolic movie that you will probably hate if you like straight end movies,or if you don't.",1,4,7,9 December 2017
