Love and Death," must see
","the greatest comedic filmmaker of our time excels in love and death. the climactic execution scene ranks as one of the funniest scenes in American cinema history. classic one liner after another keeps the viewer in hysterics throughout, and there is no downtime here.what an underrated masterpiece. allen may suffer here in based on the fact that this is pre-annie hall and thus this one tends to be sandwiched between classics such as take the money and run and woody's Oscar winner. i would love to be privy to what the reviews at the time of release were because this one gets so little fanfare. get the DVD today. allen fans will not stop laughing at this one. non allen supporters will find some way to knock this timeless material.",10,7,9,4 July 2005
