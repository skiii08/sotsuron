The Blair Witch Project," Deliverence meets Man Bites Dog
","Blair Witch Project may be one of the more inventive ideas to come to the big screen in a long time. It takes a lost in the woods struggle of Deliverence, a slasher film premise and films it in a style so much like Man Bites Dog that the film makers had to have seen Man Bites Dog. There are cetin key elements however to watching the movie with optimum veiwing pleasure. One of those is the whole marketing campaign built around it, especially the sci fi channel special. Secondly I had seen this movie twice in the theaters, once in an art house theater on opening night and the second time in a giant super plex. The movies scariness is tripled by seeing it in a small very private theater, it adds to the real feeling of the movie. Seeing it in an auditorium with people munching on pop corn and teenagers talking detracts infinetly from it's feeling of reality that the makers tried to aim for. Substantial amounts of credit need to go to the film makers for their filming techniques. Such as not filling in the actors on all the plot details. Brilliant but partial inadvertant acting from the actors make this movie feel as though you could have filmed it yourself. One other thing that sets this movie apart is that there are no big shocks in it, the scariness of it all comes from letting the imagination get way ahead of you. See it with Man Bites Dog and compare the numerous similarities. Give it an 8 out of 10",Null,0,0,13 September 1999
Requiem for a Dream," Everything that DARE warned you about
","Oh how I loathe this movie! The first thing that came to mind after watching it was the two hours I wasted hoping something would happen. The second thing that came to mind was the line in Trainspotting 'people always focus on the misery, death, and despair around heroin, and that's not to be ignored. But what they forget is the pleasure of it. After all we're not f**king stupid' This movie does seem to forget the pleasure and just assume that it's stupid charecters are REALLY stupid. I have no pity for any of the charecters who never seem to question their own motives (a quality I quite liked in Renton). The charecter played by Ellen Burstyn is especially nauseating. It took all my mental faculties to prevent myself from fast forwarding through her highly annoying parts. How can anyone feel sorry for a diet crazy, TV addict? And I may not know much about diet pills, but I seriously doubt that you begin to visually hallucinate from them.
I guess what I'm really trying to get at is how is this anti-drug propaganda any diffrent from the infamous and laughable drug propaganda of the late 1930's????? I'm reminded of Reefer Madness and The Devil's Harvest. While those movies deal with marajuana which has arguably never harmed anyone, and this movie deals with heroin which has helped ruin or at least sidetrack many people's lives, the blame game in either movie sounds the same. Since human beings have a free will and drugs do not, the shift of blame should fall entirely on the humans and their choices. The unanswerable question for the charecters in this lame movie is this: Drugs or otherwise, if these people were this stupid to have gotten themselves in these situations, how far would they have gone anyways??????????????I'm so disappointed by Darren Aronofsky. I really enjoyed Pi.",1,8,18,17 April 2003
The Ring," aggresive marketing and advertising as the sum of all evils
","I love this movie. I had wanted to seem it in theaters but as usually I just stayed home and got drunk. So finally I rented it and watched it at home. The filming style reminded me of the same style used in Koyaanisqatsi that eventually found it's way into the hands of Trent Reznor for the Nine Inch Nails video Closer. If that wasn't enough to pull me in, the Jacob's Ladder style of creepiness that runs throughout the movie would also have sufficed. I'm so sick of movies like Scream and Signs that have a certin wacky predictablity, and plot that fit together so tightly that it's a wonder why the charecters in the movie don't figure out what's going on. Here we are now with a visually intense what-the-why-the-hell-is-this-going-on creepathon that doesn't seem to pander. The movie contains very minute amounts of actual violence on screen, much like Jacob's Ladder and has this kind of decent into insanity where 'why?' just sort of becomes an invariable question. As far as reasons are concerned for the source of or cause of the evil, lots of theories can be hypothesized. Mine goes along the line of thinking that the lesson learned by the movie is that much like the government, the only way to stay safe from evil is to partake in it's execution. No pun intended. I give this movie a nine out of ten because as much as I would have enjoyed some female nudity from Amber Tamblyn or Naomi Watts the movie would not pander to my idiocy. Thank you.",9,0,0,17 April 2003
Casablanca," Bogie
","The American Film Institute lists Casablanca as the 2nd or 3rd greatest movie ever. While I will agree that it is a high quality piece of film I can't understand how it can rank that high. The movie is well acted, well directed, and the screenplay contains the more memorable quotes than any movie ever. That is an indicator of either of two things. Either the writing is the greatest ever or people just really cling to the old romance and intrigue story. I like Bogie's character. What a classic screen drunkard. Try watching this movie and keeping up with the drinking bogie does in it, you'll be face down in an ocean of your own vomit before the twelve minute mark. He is cold to the world and looks at things in a super rational way. Sam shoulda got his own movie. He could have been the 40's version of the Dolemite. Because the rest of the characters seem befuddled next to Bogie it gives the feel of watching a one man show. The story doesn't stand out that much, it's pretty standard Romance material. I'd rather watch Travis Bickle.",7,0,4,21 June 1999
Se7en," What would you do?
","Seven is the most deeply disturbing ever made. The horrific brutality of the murders in various scenes stays with you longer then you might like. Great writing, directing, cinematography, special effects, and acting highlight this film and make it one of the 10 best movies in the 90's. The seven brutal murders are either under filmed or filmed in dark unlit places so as to leave the viewer's imagination running in overdrive. Each murder is brutal enough to jolt you and make you not forget it. My personal favorit are lust, and sloth. The man tied to the bed and tortured for a year is sick and twisted as anything I've ever seen. The special effects of this and the gluttony murder are perfect. The writing is flawless in assembling this perfect crime with a purpose. The screenplay makes sure to be as descriptive in the details of each death so as to further the viewer's imagination as though reading a book instead of watching a movie. The creepy dark atmosphere of the movie can be credited to perfect directing. And great performances by the four central characters: Morgan Freeman (who is always great and gives any movie a certain nobility), Kevin Spacey who is perfect as the sick lunatic who's crimes go way beyond that of Keyser Soze, Brad Pitt (in his 2nd best role), and Gwyenth Paltrow who does a maximum job with her minimal screen time. But the sickest question in the movie remains the horric and disturbing end. >",9,0,0,4 July 1999
Citizen Kane," Great, great movie...but.................
","There's no doubt that Citizen Kane is a great movie. It is a pioneering film that forever changed film making. Its plot is one of the most creative and original in all of movie history. The cinematography is stunnning. The writing, and acting (mostly by amatuers) is flawless. However many say that this is the greatest movie. I don't see how this is possible when Citizen Kane although a great film is not throughly entertaining. Reservoir Dogs, The Godfather, and Star Wars are all equal or near equal in nearly every category as Citizen Kane but they manage to be exceedingly entertaining. Either way Citizen Kane is still a great movie and more young people such as myself should see it.",9,0,0,12 April 1999
Amistad," good, but not great
","over all the film amistad is well acted, directed, et cetera. it's a good movie on the whole, with no loss of technical mastery of the medium of film. it has anthony hopkins and morgan freeman, two actors who lend considerable weight to any movie (albeit here they are relegated to supporting rolls) and there are a number of other small but fine performances. nothing about the movie really stands out, much like numerous other historical pieces, it achieve quality but not superiority. One of the things about historical films like this is their tendency to cut and paste modern mentalities upon characters that would have had strikingly different world views. While the movie holds true about the moral crusade of the early abolitionists, it tends to gloss over the fact that few abolitionists would have considered africans as equal members of society to themselves. It also underplays the fact that some of the early motivation for the end of slavery was purely economic. These starkly contrast the usual narrative that pits everything into easily understood categories of good and evil. In history as in the world there are numerous shades of grey. A wonderful historical piece would be one that would present us with the questions involved in such complex issues in ways that would not be dumbed down, but instead unmitigated exploration of the conflicting values of an ever changing world. Plus it would feature some gratuitous nudity for the sake of entertainment.6 out of 10",6,2,5,22 November 2005
The Fan," Yet another great DeNiro flick.
","There's some things in life you can always count on. Beer thats tasty, The Shaw Brothers, and Robert De Niro performances. De Niro gets his best Taxi Driver/ Cape Fear psycho going as Gil Renard. To add to the fun De Niro's a knife salesman in this. His stalking target is Wesley Snipes a baseball player. I love baseball, I love DeNiro, I love movies,this is all three. One moment of particular hilarity is when Gil and his catcher meet to discuss their baseball playing days. The revelation provides a comic moment.

Dawn of the Dead," not my genre
","i tend to shy away from horror movies. i have for years. it's not that i'm scared or that i object to violence and gore or anything quite so quaint as that. my problem with horror movies has been (and is likely to remain ever so) the intelligence, or more to the point lack thereof on the part of the characters. to me a movie has to have characters that behave in (mostly) rational way. characters have to have intelligence or it feels like porn for it's plot. generally horror movies tend towards characters that lack any fiber of what could be called intelligence, they make mistakes no clear thinking human being is likely make and tend to compound their mistakes when given an opportunity. it is this behavior of characters that generally lead to horror movie fans that talk to the screen, dictate to the movie, et cetera, et cetera. I liked Dawn Of The Dead because it avoided this fairly well at times. But during a few scenes the irrational stupidity of characters shone through. In fact one of the best examples of any horror movie stupidity presented itself when the character Steve (alone and in the dark as usual) puts down a perfectly good weapon (a crowbar) and picks up a lesser weapon, a croquet mallet. A nearly unbreakable heavy metal bar or a fabricated piece of cheap wood, what sane person in dire circumstances would prefer the later to the former? Perhaps, yes, i am over thinking the movie here (instead of sitting back and immersing myself) but this type of stupidity leaves me feeling as though i am the fool for wasting my money.low 6 out of 10",6,0,0,30 October 2006
12 Angry Men," perhaps the most overrated film in history
","When reviewing on imdb, the window pops up a selection between spoiler or no spoiler for your review. can one spoil a movie this flat? this predictable? Maybe in 1957 the characters in this movie seemed thick and nuanced but having seen this recently for the first time i was struck by how one dimensional each seemed. from the first few minutes of the movie you can easily decipher who's going to be a 'bad' guy and who's going to be a bastion of choirboy-like fairness and innocence. maybe given the self contained nature of the plot there is much room for character development but perhaps something a little less like caricatures....the other thing that bothered me about the movie that pays so much attention to method of reason is the fact that early on in the movie it is stated that the knife had been wiped clean before the police got there. but according to witnesses the boy allegedly fled right a way. this seems a bit incongruent and yet no one in the movie has brought it up and no critical review of the movie seems to have brought it up. it would seem to be a major factor in the case and i can't believe it is overlooked. instead it's omission from discussion only makes the whole plot look as thin as the characters.........and upon further review each 'explanation' or alternative given to explain away the facts in the case seems far-fetched.... but taken all together seems a full on miscarriage of justice. a nuanced director might have ended in a hung jury. NOPE. this one dimensional movie has to either be 1 or 0 or in the case of the jury all for or all against.even at a paltry ninety minutes it still greatly overstays it's welcome.

The Terminator," Arnold goes heavy metal
","Nice night for a walk, eh?  Not so fast, better drive. Cause Arnold is after you in this the king of all Arnold movies. Probably one of the most original ideas to come out of Hollywood around that time. So what if you've seen it a thousand times? Who hasn't? This movie has lots and lots of cool stuff. I mean who wouldn't want they're own Terminator around, just for goofs. Send him after the Jehovah's Witnesses, send him after the cops who busted you for speeding last week, send him after the paper boy from Better Off Dead. Cool guns, big explosions, cyborg, future vehicles of destruction, and my personal favorite, an entire police station full of cops being wiped out. It doesn't get any better than cops being obliterated. #23 on my top 100",9,1,2,18 March 1999
Catch-22," Catch as catch can.
","Joseph Heller's attack on every aspect of modern society comes to life on screen in this anti:war,capitalism,religon,pride,self importance,new deal,consumerism movie. Alan Arkin plays a man who realizes that his enemies aren't the one who the government tell him but are who ever is trying to kill him. And that being the rule of thumb he comes to the conclusion that the US Army is his enemy. This and other hilarious outtakes on the insanity of war, including Milo Minderbinder's bombing of his own fortress for profits for the army. Watch this puppy to many times and you might just begin to realize that there isn't anything in the world that isn't a catch 22. It's enough to drive you to the point nipple shaving insanity.

Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Nuclear Annihilation is funny.
","Unquestionably the funniest pre-Zucker Brothers movie.....EVER! So many great things about this movie. It is well acted by Peter Sellars in the role of three parts. The funniest of those being the title character. But the show is stolen by Slim Pickens in the classic sowboy ride on the nuclear bomb as it crashes toward earth. And also by Sterling Hayden as the battle obsessed general gone off the deep end. George C. Scott also does his job well as the equally battle obsessed but sane general. So many classic lines and classic scenes. A great score. Young James Earl Jones in a bit part. My personal favorite scene in the movie is the trooper who is more worried about the Coca Cola Company then nuclear fallout. This movie is exteremly funny on such a dark topic. It laughs at the entire insanity and trivialness of nuclear combat. This movie is unlike any other ever made. Unique in every fiber. See it, but be sure to keep a bottle of rain water handy.

Full Metal Jacket," No major malfunctions here!

Forrest Gump," A trip through American History via an idiot's ramblings.
","I like Forrest Gump. It's a very emotionally packed movie that is well acted, written, and filmed. I think the film adaptation is better than the book itself and the deep symbolism play an important role in that. The rcreation of five decades in American History is truly a feat to be hailed. And the soundtrack is a very good mix of oldies. One thing that strikes me as impressive in this movie is the attention to details. Such as the filming of Bubba's ansectors and Lt. Dan's history of ansestors dying in wars. Even the most standard of short scenes can take hours to film. These quick flashbacks take up less than 12 seconds of film and weren't even totally necessary to film, but they did anyway. That gives this movie an A for effort in my book.",8,0,2,24 April 1999

The Godfather: Part II," Another movie you can't refuse.
","There's so many good things in this movie it's ridiculous. Great performances all around from Al Pacino, Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, Lee Strasburg, John Cazale and especially from Robert DeNiro who is the only one who could fill Marlon Brando's shoes. DeNiro does such a great job at acting as Brando's Vito Corleone that he won an Oscar. The first time two actors won an Oscar for playing the same character. Great writing by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. Highly under-appreciated but great acting by Richard Bright and Bruno Kirby in bit parts. A well written score is a staple of this movie. Flawless directing of the two coinciding stories of young Vito Corleone and his aging son Michael as the heads of a powerful mob family. I especially love the scenes of young Vito Corleone as an up and coming mobster and wish there were more of them. I would have liked to know the orgins of Luca Brasi, Johnny Fontaine, and Tom Hagen. As well as Sonny's rise to power. The book covers Luca Brasi's orgins with the Corleone's but... This is a worthy sequel to the flawless movie The Godfather. Awesome.",10,1,1,29 April 1999

The Thing," Wilford Brimley with a gun
","Wilford Brimley seems to be of a dying breed in movies. Gruff old dudes who seem to eat drywall nails for brunch only sleep for half an hour a day cause it cuts in to their drinking time. Lee Marvin may be dead, Clint Eastwood may be playing nice guys with hearts made of pure gold, but there's still this early 80's gem and Wilford Brimley long before he was hawking life insurance off the back of a horse.The movie serves as an exercise in paranoia and if you can figure out who's who in the movie than you are truly more sober than i. There's a pretty good amount of violence and the special effects are way better and more invented than the cheap and easy CGI that any half-assed movie contains nowadays. It may be nostalgia to say that the movies have loss the quirky inventiveness needed to think up solutions to all sorts of special effects problems, but there it is.John Carpenter does a good job of pacing the story and action just right and Keith David as always adds a great supporting roll.give 7 out of 10 raise it to 8 if you've got some alcohol",7,0,1,30 August 2006
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," oh, the good old days
","Kristanna Loken and Claire Danes are absolutely beautiful. Great to look at. The movie has our old friend arnold in his best role. The casket of guns and a few other comedic points are good for some laughs. But what this movie suffers from is what makes it invisible and boring compared to the first terminator movies. James Cameron not directing the characters he invented hurts. The presence of Sara Connor is sorely missed. And maybe it because I'm older and harder to please than when Terminator 2 came out (i was like 12 or 13) , or it could be that when it came out CGI special effects were very new and very impressive, now with 12 years, a couple of Jurassic Park movies, Matrix movies, and several hundred lesser movies featuring CGI, the effect no longer seems special and can even seem cumbersome and even downright distracting. All that said T3 will be somewhat enjoyable film though Loken's villain lacks Robert Patrick's utter child-molester creepiness from part 2. But it didn't leave me floored like part 2 did. And what is with humanity losing it's free will in the movie, and the machines gaining their's?6 out 10",6,0,0,3 November 2004
American Beauty," Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
","American Beauty appears to be the best movie of 1999 and secures a place for Kevin Spacey into the ranks DeNiro, Nicholson, Keitel, Pitt, and Cruise as one of the greatest actors alive. The movie is near flawless in direction, acting, cinematography, pace, writting, charecter development, entertainment value, and accuracy. Kevin Spacey has the performance of his career and yet it is equalled by the brilliant acting of several others most noticably newcomer Wes Bentley and sexy young Thora Birch. The movie portrays suburban America better then anything I've ever seen and manages to be funny, dark, dramatic, violent, and sad. A virtual roller coaster of a movie that flows perfectly between scenes that are on all opposites of the emotional spectrum. The flow from a dinner scene where Kevin Spacey explodes with rage is hilarious smoothly into the next scene of Thora Birch teaching Wes Bentley about beauty thats dramatic, and finally into a violent confrontation between Bentley and his on-screen military father. The filming of it goes hand in hand with the marvelous directing. The theme of each person seeking out what is beautiful to him or her also teaches the drawbacks to finding it. Spacey does a hilarious and convincing stoned seen. And I'll never be able to get the image of him lifting weights and smoking weed out of my head. I'd like to see Kevin Spacey from Se7en argue with Kevin Spacey from this. (Kevin Spacey in Se7en believed that the whole world is ugly and horrible) (Kevin Spacey in this believe there is beauty in everything) They could each have a partner in the argument too. Morgan Freeman for Se7en Sapcey and Wes Bently for American Spacey.There is possibly a bit too much drama in it and I could see how some people would say there's nothing mystical about a bag floating on air, there's no deeper meaning, just as there is no deeper meaning to life or anything else into the universe. To think other wise is to believe in a religon of nature, and would be reading too much into a bag floating on air. This movie is kind of too optimistic. But the movie knows that by telling the veiwer the beauty is in the eye of the beholder, to each his own. I would'nt blame anyone for changing their philosophy on life a little after seeing this. Even though changing your life because of a movie is kind of shallow and self defeating in this case. Director Sam Mendes has a good future if continues to direct like this and continues to get such performances from his actors and actresses. Annette Benning, Mena Suvara, and Chris Cooper make the absolute most out of their roles and do more then an ample job at it. This movie has more charecter depth then any movie I have ever seen. You can see how each charecter is multi faceted, and has a personality, and their basic charecter flaws, and how each charecter percieves the world in more then just one way. Each charecter can be seen to have multiple emotions running through them all at the same time, like in real life. When they are angry they aren't just angry, they are angry and scared and happy and sad all at the same time. With the exception of Wes Bentleys mom who seems to be the creepiest person in movie history. And it's not often I use the word creepy. Plus many small details are paid attention to in the movie. Like the poster in Spacey's garage of the pot leaf and colors. Posters such as that are usually a staple of any free whelling pot smoker. The messy garage with shelves cluttered with junk is a part of suburban Americana. The way Annette Benning treats her couch is how lot of people are about couches, again Kevin Spacey's first scene of being stoned is truly perfect. PERFECT. He must have really smoked weed to get it so perfect. Just as perfect as the stoned performances of Cheech and Chong during the first thirty minutes of Up In Smoke. So accurate it doesn't even seem like acting. My only problem with this movie is where to rank it on my all time best. Because while it does weigh up to such movies as Reservoir Dogs and The Wild Bunch which are at the very top of my list, it doesn't seem to hold a candle to movies like American History X, or Taxi Driver which are a little lower. But all in all it is a breath taking picture worthy of a slew of Oscars and quite possibly could be one of the best peices of cinema since Citizen Kane. As for me I give it a definate 10 out of 10. And I've seen it three times including opening night.",10,0,0,11 October 1999
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Director's cut way way way better.
","Oh woe is the poor souls who have yet to see the director's cut of Terminator 2. I pity thee. Great regular Terminator 2 is, but greater still is the director's cut. There's lots of reasons to love this movie. Arnold gives us the same big gun toting, king of the bullet dimension, rough and tough performance that we all expect from him. James Cameron equals his first Terminator movie in every way and even one ups it in a couple of categories. Like special effects. Along with Jurassic Park this has the greatest special effects of any movie ever. The T-1000 morphs are unbelievable and can be enjoyed despite countless viewings. This time around Arnold's accent isn't as thick so he actually gets a few more speaking lines then just his infamous 'I'll be back!' A great supporting cast rounds out the picture and good writing and a little humor add on some points. But the director's cut Oh boy. You get a great deal of extra scenes, probably about 25 minutes in all. Plus that includes alot of key special effects scene, a return of Micheal Biehn's character Reese from the first Terminator, a better look at Joe Morton's character's home life and entire plot element. If you're going to purchase this movie I can't stress enough how much you should get the director's cut. It features a second tape with more outtakes, the theatrical trailers, and the alternative ending. Buy the director's cut. You won't be sorry.",9,1,1,11 May 1999
Duck Soup," caught off guard
","i caught this movie about a quarter of the way in on turner classic movies recently and figured i'd watch it. i knew that if was often listed as the funniest movie ever made and i was skeptical that a movie could be funnier than my beloved airplane! most of my experience with older comedies has not been that great. with the exceptions of the three stooges and dr strangelove it seemed that the older a comedy way the less funny it seemed. this would not be the case with duck soup. quite a number of decent site gags a a round number of dated jokes that fell flat were terrifically overwhelmed by the rapid fire linguistic judo of groucho. and even harpo's silent bit worked a lot better than i ever expected it to. the film seems to exist in a cynical hyperspace when viewed next to some of it's other contemporary output. at turns it is absurdest, surreal, cynical, and out and out wacky (couldn't think of a better word) i'd recommend this to anyone who appreciates the finer points of HOW comedy works. timing is impeccable.9 out of 10",9,1,2,31 July 2005
Being John Malkovich," Very Good but very f**ked up movie
","Being John Malkovich is the most original movie since Brazil. It shares the same insane sense of humor and presents us with a world which is very similar to the one created in Brazil. Great performances by John Cusack, John Malkovich, and Cameron Diaz, but can't be fully appreciated because the material that they work with is the show stealer. This is a movie that could have gone over the 200 minute mark and probably still would have been interesting. It's dark ending is a bit scary and you can't help but feel a bit of sympathy for poor Malkovich who gets but a few fleeting seconds of freedom before becoming a prisoner to the greedy old bastard and his collegues.

Jarhead," funny
","very very heavily influenced by full metal jacket, this hilarious take on the Persian gulf war of 1991 is entertaining as hell. sam mendes does a great job directing and the actors portray their characters nicely, but the greatness lies in the writing of the movie. not being familiar with the novel i'm not sure how much of the material came from the book directly, though i would suspect most of the narration is taken verbatim. three things that got me beyond the humor was the spectacular visuals towards the end of the film of the oil fields burning. it reminded me of Dante's inferno, or the book of revelations, literally a world falling apart. the second was the awkwardness of hearing music by nirvana in the movie. i don't know if this is the first movie to feature nirvana on the soundtrack, but it's the first i know of, and being a fan of the music, it sounded out of place. the final thing that got to me was the underlying theme of cuckolding. in the movie it insights paranoia and fear out of all. it seems all consuming in the movie. the deer hunter scene almost made me cringe with embarrassment and humiliation at how something like that must be emotionally and spiritually destructive. men tend to be territorial when it comes to the intimacies of their lovers, and in monogamous societies this is accentuated even more by the feelings of exclusivity that comes with pair bonding. in this light nothing could be more destructive to a man than his 'sanctuary' being invaded. other than all that jazz though the movie was rather entertaining and a good watch, it shifts away from the gritty emotionalism of war movies like platoon and tigerland and stands side by side with kubrick's full metal jacket and catch 22 in the infinite absurdities in and of war.9 out of 10",9,4,8,6 November 2005
The Machinist," good atmosphere
","this movie is a haunting depiction of a man who hasn't slept in a year. the question at the center of the movie is 'why?' this movie has it's spiritual and thematic roots in the movie Jacob's Ladder from 1990 a movie in which the main character has increasing struggle trying to distinguish real from imagined. since jacob's ladder there seem to be an increasing number of movie treading the same territory, but each ending with a different explanation for the sinister phenomena the occurs throughout. despite the fact that these movies often follow the same arc and have very similar endings i've yet to tire of them. and this is no exception. this is another well acted piece, and gets to boast the beautiful jennifer jason lee in yet another great job working in a small roll. and of course our old friend Micheal ironside shows up for the same type of masochistic rolls he gravitates toward.good movie but see jacob's ladder first 7 out of 10",7,1,2,1 November 2005

Of course both movies borrowed from the father of alien movies, War Of The Worlds, which is also much better then this and is probably as good as V and V the Final Battle.",6,1,2,18 March 1999
The Dirty Dozen," The manliest man's movie EVER!
","This movie has guts. If ever there were one movie made by men for men, this is it. I saw this first when I was five. I watched it with my dad, and since then have not yet found a man who can say anything bad about this. The cast reads like a list of movie tough guys from the late 60's and early 70's. Borgnine, Bronson, Brown, Cassavettes, Savalas, Ryan, Jaecjel, Sutherland, Kennedy, and the toughest of the toughs Lee Marvin. Lee Marvin is so tough he'd smack around Superman just for wearing tights. Even in Delta Force when he was really old Lee Marvin was still the toughest guy on the screen. This movie fits the standard 'Men On A Mission' plot. Simple but effective. They must kill lots of Nazi's. Where are movies like this today?",10,3,10,25 April 1999
Legends of the Fall," crazy as it seems
","i'm not quite sure why i like this movie, but i do. there are indeed several point within the movie that i can point to and say i like but that doesn't explain why i will usually watch this movie all the way through whenever i pass it by on cable. the world war one scenes are great, and i generally think that world war one is highly under explored in film. (ever since all quiet on the western front in 1930 few movie have done anything but add footnotes to that wonderful film about that terrible war). i also love the scenes near the end with anthony hopkins writing stuff on a chalk board hung around his neck. to me this seems some odd and amusing that it's probably the reason i can't look away. other than that the movie has some major flaws. the Indian character is so clichéd in his behavior and speech, that i'm surprised Indian nations haven't screamed and protested, demanding to be portrayed as savages as they were in early westerns. at the end where the oldest brother (aiden quinn) shoots some gangsters assaulting his family, i'm tempted to remember the scene in godfather where pacino assures brando 'i'm with you now papa' 8/10",8,0,2,20 April 2005
Before Sunset," more depressing than the first!!!!!
","in this sequel to before sunrise Richard Linklater once again takes a masterful albeit bittersweet tone to film dialogue and walks away once again reminding us of Shakespeare's line about life being but 'sound and fury, signifying nothing' this time around however he takes the anything can happen attitude of the first sequel and smothers it under an attitude of 'but most things are improbable'. The continuing story of two strangers who can and should be but simply aren't also reminds us of the short story by Haraku Murakami 'On Seeing The 100% Perfect Girl One Beautiful April Morning' The sadness of the fleeting moments and how even as we grasp at the here and now it still manages to slip through are fingers, seems to be what Linklater as down to perfection and the everyone should see this film and it's sad predecessor before they die. The seen where Julie Delpy almost reaches for Ethan Hawke is absolutely perfect in it's quiet sadness.10 out of 10",10,0,0,6 February 2006
Saving Private Ryan," Best war story since The Best Years Of Our Lives
","I find it hard to compare war movie of different wars. All Quiet On The Western Front, Full Metal Jacket, and Platoon are some of my favorites. Glory an Braveheart are also extremely good. Saying this is the best war movie ever is tough. Apocalypse Now, FMJ, and Platoon are all great movies but don't have as great a plot or anything approaching the cinematography of this movie. The cinematography of the opening battle scene is by far the greatest 15 minutes in the history of film technique. It has to be experienced on a theater screen and up close to get the full feeling of the sheer insanity that takes place in the midst of a battle. The story that follows the super impressive opening is no less genius. It's a great Dr Strangelove feel of conflicting morals, interests, and sanity. Tom Hanks,Tom Sizemore do wonderful acting jobs and I'm not quite sure who plays the sniper but he steals the movie from everyone. Great writing and attention to detail including actual Panzer tank sounds rack up more points for this movie. The violence much like any real war has quite a humbling effect. And the backdrop of D-Day (often called the greatest battle in history) provides the perfect opportunity to show how horrible death really is. Actual veterans went into siezers, flashbacks, and emotional trauma when viewing this movie. A help line was even set up to help them cope with the visions. That really says a lot about a film.",10,0,0,21 May 1999
City of God," a bit of the old ultra violence
","it's been a while since anything with the violent intensity of 'city of god' has come out in the united states. this film definitely marks a good start for the director Fernando Meirelles and his use of film technique that is very similar to David Fincher, David o Russell, and Guy Ritchie. lots of frantic energy and cinged colors. one of the movie's main antagonists Lil Ze runs around like a miniature rabid Samuel l Jackson circa pulp fiction. the story centers on the criminal lives of children and young adults in Rio de Janeiro. i think that the movie while never making a political point of it lends a good amount support about just what type of anarchy results from the failed international war on drugs, including but not limited to: the creation of a black market, that gets increasingly violent as it is cracked down on, corrupt police tactics, an excess of wealth and desire for firearms for criminal purposes, international civil unrest, and a broad tool that the have-not in society may use to fore-go education in favor of black market profits. all that nonsense aside, this film is powerful in several ways.the young actors really really manage a tremendous job of translating raw emotion directly to the screen. i'm not sure to many young American actors could have pulled off such a feet of acting. is it even acting? the wonderful pacing and extensive use of flashback to move the movie through a great narrative direction. the setting itself, much like the french setting in ronin, adds a lot of detail and quirkiness to the way the film looks and the overall feel. all these things come together quite wonderfully for one of the best movies i've seen in a while. the only thing i missed is the fate of the lovely angelica is never revealed or mentioned, she simply disappears from the narrator's life and from the film. with the exception of that i i think the film was nearly flawless. this in comparison with the recent viewing of the french movie 'those who love me can take the train',and it looks like France's future as a leader in good cinema is uncertain at best and unimaginable at worst.9 out of 10",9,2,5,25 November 2005
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," masterpiece theater
","I grew up in the eighties watching the grind house chop socky that came out of hong kong..... kung fu movies skinny on plot (usually avenging someone's death) but infinitely detailed in style. Finally in the late nineties and early new millennium there has been a surge of movies looking to final put substance to the style. Enter Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. A movie that pleases every facet of my imagination. From good acting, well choreographed fighting, an intelligent plot, and lush scenery. This is a great movie. And I believe that fifty years down the line it will hold up as well as some of John Ford's epic westerns. Think Searchers for a new generation. There are few if any weak points in this movie. Worth multiple viewing. 10 out of 10",10,0,1,3 November 2004
School of Rock," oh.........
","how could Richard Linklater do this??? There is no joy in Dougville having seen this movie. Somehow the same man that put together Dazed and Confused, Tape, Before Sunrise, and the visionary Waking Life has stumbled into some sort of Disney inspired insanity with Jack Black (who becomes less and less funny the more and more we see of him.)maybe i just don't like movies featuring little kids. but i could have cried because this movie is so bad. think rocky or karate kid but with music and prepubescent pond scum. This movie at it's very best only made me want to go listen to a few of the bands it mentions (none that actually appear on the soundtrack... does anyone like AC/DC???????) Ugh!!! I'm so down. How could this terrible movie get made. Who said 'hey, let's put jack black with a bunch of cute kids and he could make silly faces and act like a third rate chris farley, then load up the soundtrack with music that runs the gamut from disasterous to decent, put some sill feel good ending in and blammo!!!!! we'll make some money!'i believe the next line is 'and god wept'",1,9,30,24 August 2004
The Game," Best film of 1997
","Mind twisting, paranoia inducing suspense about a control freak whose life is turned upside down. Michael Douglas stars in his best performance since Falling Down and Sean Penn does a fine job in the role of his younger conniving brother. Debroah Unger is sexy as the token female lead/love intrest. When I originally saw this in the theater I walked out of it so paranoid that I was looking over both shoulders for a week. This movie has strong writting and directing. Even a decent soundtrack (A rarity for a suspense/thriller). Attention to detail and a twisted sense of humor are what keep this movie a head above the rest. But keep in mind that the man that rented this to you could be involved. But it's all just a game or is it?",10,0,1,28 April 1999
Hero," .. it is true, and I saw that her name was god......
","Suffice it to say that I'm neither the first, nor will I be the last to mention or compare this to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but it makes the world easier to understand to group together certain things, and I have just the limited amount of scope or vision to fall back on such easy mnuemonic techniques. This is a beautiful film. It takes nearly all of the positive attributes of CT,HD and levels them up another notch. Along with the required complex and gravity defying (does gravity ever apply to the Chinese) choreography of the fighting and action scenes, the brilliant use of CGI (which normally drives plots instead of accentuating them), the tremendous acting by all, including the radiant Zhang Ziyi, and a wonderful plot that shifts in sequence, and perspective (Kane, no?) there a host of other little details that go almost unnoticed. Several sequences harked back to the very particular moves and actions that I remember from some of the classic kung fu movies of the 60's 70's and 80's. The colorful costuming seems vibrant and to make ever scene take on a life and importance of it's own. There is even some political lessons that apply very much to today's world. Pew. awesome. 10 out of 10. nearly flawless. shave and a haircut.",10,2,3,3 November 2004
Pi," the world desperately trying to understand itself.
","Pi is a movie teaming with ideas and self realization. The premise is quite simple in that it is an exploration of a mathematician trying to understand explore the nature of reality. The closer he gets to truth the farther he strays from understanding it. The movie lingers on the golden ratio ( 1.618034 ) found in the Fibonacci sequence (1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987.....) and how this man made creation is one way to understand the world by it's mere presence (percieved or real) everywhere in nature. Several ideas don't even have to be mentioned in the movie to play a part such as quantum mechanics, chaos theory, and the uncertinty pricncipal which have all conspired to bring an end or limitation to the uses of mathematics. The curious idea hardly mentioned in the movie is that computers become self aware working with these complex mathematics and try to understand themselves by which they go mad and shut down all practical functioning. The same can be said of the lead charecter of Max. As he tries to ponder the world he overlook that he is a part of that world and he must ultimately understand himself to understand the world. When he fails to do this he only digs a deeper hole and eventually all the practicalities in life such as eating, sleeping, and human relationships become secondary in importance to him. Darren Aronofsky has made a wonderously intelligent film here. I could have watched another two hours of this and I'll bet it probably would not have slowed down a bit. This is a rare movie that I think even those who respect it will over look how truly great it is. An intricate work of art that has so many philosophical ideas and an under belly of morality that itcould be one of the best movies in the last two decades. I like it.",10,2,5,15 January 2003
Million Dollar Baby," the best laid plans of..............
","i don't see what everyone is all up in arms over this movie about. true the actors do fine jobs in their given rolls but the movie seems like a cross pollination of rocky and Of Mice And Men. The hints that are dropped throughout the movie of what is coming at the end seem pretty clear and so the end doesn't come as much of a surprise. Clint Eastwood is great as Burgess Meredith and Morgan Freeman plays the same roll he plays in every movie, that of the aged, wise, and world weary man with hints of narration. If Freeman wasn't so good at playing the roll it would be unforgivable but try seeing if his roll from Glory, or Se7en, or Shawshank, or Unforgiven, or Kiss The Girls, is any different.....What really leaves a foul taste in the mouth and holds this movie back is the utter lack of reconciliation. The only bit of it comes between Freeman and a cocky young boxer. I'm shallow i like vengeance in film and too many characters do to many evil or annoying things without some sort of closure. The dirty boxer, the ex-con punk kid, the lazy mother, et cetera.I thought it was a good movie but certainly nothing to salivate over, and multiple viewings i doubt would add much. 7 out of 10",7,0,1,11 January 2006

","I don't fancy myself a smart man and I'd like to think I'm not dumb either. I really like David Lynch. And I felt fine conceding to not understanding Eraserhead because I figured that Eraserhead was made without any real substance to understand. Mullholand Drive on the other hand seemed to follow a trajectory of a complex plot until the last half hour or so when it just twisted in on itself and began to make absolutely no sense that I could discern. I'm sure somebody has a good explanation that I can quaff at and say, 'sounds good, but no, there's no sensible plot in the movie' I simply can't believe I'm the only one befuddled by Mullholand Drive",7,0,0,10 December 2001
The Evil Dead," Can you say classic?
","Bruce Campbell. He's awesome. This movie marks the beginning of Bruce in action as our fav hero Ash. (Anyone notice he has a slight resemblence to Jim Carrey?) Evil Dead is an awesome movie by Sam Raimi with a chock full of blood, gore, and some dark dark humor. This isn't as funny or as cool as the 1987 remake/sequel but it has one truly defining moment that isn't in the second one. The tree rape scene. It's amusing, sick, offensive, and just downright nutty. Bruce campbell starts off as a much picked-upon Ash who when ever hit always seems to go flying into furniture. There's always furniture in the way of his fall. Always! See this because it's Bruce Campbell. See this because it's Sam Raimi. See this because it's good. Just see this!",8,1,2,11 May 1999
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," can't these flies just leave me alone?????
","Although not as great as Tarantino's early work this movie has plenty of frenetic energy that makes his movies great. The first half of Kill Bill seems to be a meditation on the highly underrated Chop Socky films out of Hong Kong during the 60's, 70's and 80's. In fact the whole film serves as a tribute to eastern culture with a slight nod to the westerns and blaxploitation. Despite it's length the movie rarely slows down and manages to make one interesting scene after another. The amounts of spilled blood (along with the joke that the corpses of defeated foes don't simply disappear once defeated) make this movie stand on it's own as a true Kung Fu film. The appearance of Sonny Chiba will have extra weight for fans of Tarantino. What emerges isn't so much a movie with emotional depth as much as a popcorn movie that doesn't stoop to jerry bruckheimer clichés. As usual black comedy and in-jokes can be shifted through the carnage and most everything falls into place. my only complaint would come from the choice of music during the winter garden fight. I know it would probably be more clichéd, but i would have preferred a dead soundtrack punctuated only by the water spigot to the jarring 70's roller derby music. Other than that I have few complaints.9 out of 10. not a romantic film.",9,1,3,18 February 2006
Black Snake Moan," good lord almighty
","this is a great movie. good music. awesome performance by Samuel l Jackson. good writing. it's unapologetically religious, which i suppose if a movie has to be religious it should be all 'aww shucks' about it. the presence of Justin timberlake is a distraction although minor. but here's what it comes down to. Christina ricci is scorching. she is so hot in this movie she could singe lead. it's embarrassing how hot she is. i felt the uncontrollable desire to fertilize her through the screen via some metaphysical conjuring trick. watching this alone in the theater i felt somehow dirty. it was difficult, truth be told, to even give much thought to the plot, dialogue, camera work, visual strategies, cinematography or much of anything else in the movie because she was such a marvelous feast for the eyes. i like Christina ricci perfect 10 out of 10",10,1,4,18 April 2007
The Graduate," Here's to you Mrs Robinson.
","I've always thought that The Graduate was funny and have always understood the plot of a young man lost in the confusion of an ever nearing adult world. But what I never have understood is its label as a generation defining movie. Maybe it's because that is not my generation, but it does seem to me that each generation is apprhensive and unsure about what their future holds even after they graduate from college. Well, it doesn't matter this movie can easily be appreciated by any generation. Its pluses include well paced humor, a good soundtrack, and the classic chase to the church scene that was spoofed at the end of Wayne's World 2. Anne Bancroft does a fine acting job as the legendarily seductive Mrs Robinson. I give it three out of four stars.",9,1,3,29 April 1999
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," adaptation for couples
","Once again Charlie Kaufman puts out a brilliant screenplay that speaks to the human plight on every level of it's existence. This movie is essentially for couples what Adaptation was for lonely souls. Jim Carrey turns in a performance as unexpected as anything I've seen in film. Even his other respected acting acredits still harbor an essence of Ace Ventura/Mask etc etc..... here it's gone completely and the character on screen is not Jim Carrey, it's Joel. Which is to say nothing of Kate Winslet who can not be forgiven for the first two hours of Titanic.All the subtle nuances of that messy affair known as love or romance is brought to full bare in this arthouse take on Total Recall's premise. I've tried to get all my married friends to watch this so that they might learn to appreciate their spouses a little more, but to no avail. The writing lacks somewhat the irony and cynicism that are present in other Kaufman works (especially Human Nature) but here it works to the movies advantage as Carrey plums the mines of of his own psychosis in order to have the choice as to whether he will one day be able to savor the bittersweet essence of giving one's own self up for the noble pursuit of happiness.

National Treasure," bruckheimer-liscous
","while no one is expecting the emotional depth Kane or the spectacular action of Raiders, this movie does manage to do it's expected job. Action-light call it. questions may be raised about whether this is a cash in on the success of the davinci code, it may be (who knows how long scripts and film idea take to come to fruition?) but it certainly wasn't hindered and dare i say helped by it. the movie stars nick cage in one of the few rolls of his that doesn't fall in either the completely hated or completely loved it categories. Historical fact not withstanding this could make for a decent watch so long as it is watched once and no back episodes of the A-Team are on another channel. Something tells me that multiple viewings would wipe out the minimal endearing qualities of the movie, such as the pseudo historical aspects and the robust tendency to tease with the possibility of action sequences. If the davinci code was to literature what jean claude van damme is to film, then this is to film what jean claude van damme is to literature. mildly entertaining but forgettable at best. 5 out of 10",5,0,1,5 January 2006
Reservoir Dogs," Without a question the greatest film ever. And I mean EVER!!!
","Reservoir Dogs is the coolest movie ever. Tarantino's directorial debut is perfect. His gift for writing great dialogue and not stereotyping his own characters is apparent from the get go. The cinematography and camera work are tributes to French film makers and their great technique. Harvey Keitel puts up his all time best performance as the very professional yet very gullible Mr White. Michael Madsen also puts out a career best as the psychotic but loyal Mr Blonde. Steve Buscemi and Tim Roth and Chris Penn also put out career high water marks. Quentin Tarantino throws in great stuff from old movie, inside jocks and ironic subliminal settings (the mortuary after a massacre) to make the movie great. Mr Blonde can be seen drinking from a Big Kahuna burger cup just like Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction. A killer soundtrack of mostly 70's music. A classic infamous super cool scene of Mr Blonde cutting off a cop's ear to the tune of Steeler's Wheel's 'Stuck In The Middle With You' while the camera pans away leaving the viewer tortured by their own imagination. Plus riffs on tipping, torture and Madonna's 'Like A Virgin' This is a must see movie. Told in cool flashbacks. Perfection.",10,1,3,18 March 1999

","this is what passes for art? this is what passes for shocking? for something to be shocking requires one of a few horrific act surrounded on all sides by relative normalcy. wall to wall sodomy and s**t eating ceases to be offensive the way it might in a john waters film and instead makes it tedious. REALLY TEDIOUS. if the goal of this movie is to shock, why not simply offer a real life snuff film of a rape or murder? the film maker seems to want to heap gratuity upon gratuity for it's own sake, so why not go all the way? the underlying philosophy seems to be spite of the fact that most people have some sort of morals or artistic sensibility. the film maker is only bluffing at the notion that we shouldn't have these or that it is us for being hypocrites. congratulate yourself you made rape, sodomy, and coprophagous as boring as any other movie cliché.if the goal of the movie is artistic or metaphorical, i call bluff on that too. the actors had to perfect an unrealism in order to spout off most of it's absurdest script. 'it's a metaphor for fascist Italy...' shut up. you could have set this movie on the moons of Jupiter and it's allege metaphors would have been no further stretched as far as credulity. the fact that something like this is allowed the Criterion treatment is a sad state of affairs for the guardians of high culture. that they value this, whilst they scoff at far better films betrays their monolithic bias against American films no matter what. don't waste two hours of your life on this. pornographic film at least has redeeming qualities. the same cannot be said of this.",1,17,29,5 February 2012

There's good dialogue, great stunts, great special effects, and in my opinion the plot ain't half bad. How can you not love Bruce Willis's wise cracking cop under pressure.

Robert DeNiro's weight gain for the late scenes in the film remain as a testament to his acting and performing ability. DeNiro does such an acting job in this that he makes me do something I never thought possible, he makes me hate Robert DeNiro. The 'hit me again' scene is classic. This is a great movie but I still think DeNiro was better in Taxi Driver.You didn't get me down Ray. You didn't get me down.",9,2,2,25 April 1999
The Silence of the Lambs," A study in building up a character as a bad ass
","If silence of the lambs didn't do anything else right (in fact it did everything right) it would serve as the perfect example of how to build up a character as a bad ass. The secret is perfectly on display. All the rules are followed. Screen time for Hannibal Lecter is kept to a minimum, at just under sixteen minutes. This utter lack of screen time which build the anxiety necessary to the character subsequently was ignored in the sequels and the result is that Hannibal falls victim to the Freddie Krueger effect where your sympathies begin to cynically side with him, thus underplaying the currents of the movie. All great heroes and villains must follow this rule in order to be considered true movie bad asses. Think Darth Vader, or Clint Eastwood in unforgiven, or Micheal Madsen as Mr blonde in reservoir dogs. The second rule is to have you're bad ass doing things decidedly not bad ass, i.e. Eastwood getting beat up in unforgiven, and here Hannibal is mostly a caged animal. The third rule is to have other characters reference the potential violence your bad ass can unleash. Here, numerous characters talk about just how bad Hannibal is, and in a masterstroke, doctor Chilton shows a picture to Jodie Foster, that the audience never sees. This is like the scene in reservoir dogs, where the audience's imagination are encouraged to imagine the most horrific things. This movie follows all the rules and creates on of the all time hard core movie bad asses!!!!!! 10 out of 10",10,1,2,10 January 2006
Mother!," a movie to divide
","It really all depends on what you want out of a movie. even within the narrow confines of movies that work entirely on the basis of metaphor, do you want that metaphor front and center like this or do you like it lurking in the background as in most Kubrick films. i wanted to hate this movie going in, but found myself oddly enjoying it while still recognizing it's flaws. It's unbending fidelity towards being metaphorical, combined with it's inability to quite perfectly work out the kinks of that metaphor, and it's habit of taking it's self so seriously makes this a movie that would be perfect for Mystery Science Theater 3000 to lampoon. The whole thing hovers precariously on the precipice of total ridiculousness but in my opinion manages just barely not to go over the edge into farce. The surrealistic nightmare that unfolds in the last 15 minutes might just be gut wrenching enough to keep the whole thing from falling apart. 7.5/10",7,0,0,19 September 2018
Blade Runner," seems a bit overrated
","I thought Blade Runner was a good movie but up until seeing it I had heard unearthly amounts of good things about the movie. I think the script lacked a little bit of depth. Who are these charecters, why do they do what they do? What is Harrison Ford's character? What makes him such a good Blade Runner? I do however like some things. The set design, costumes, and a super sexy Sean Young are all definite pluses. Maybe I'm not seeing something",7,2,4,21 May 1999
Before Sunrise," beautifully captures the fleeting
","i'm not even sure what to say about this film. it's one of only a handful of movies ever made that i would consider romantic. to try to talk plot or performance or technical details about this film would be in the words of frank zappa 'like dancing about architecture'. it absolutely hits the nail right on the head in the way it captures those fleeting moments in life that move us and then run away from us never to be experienced again. this seems like the movie the character version of charlie kaufman in the movie Adaptation wanted to write. the ending is left open and ambiguous, no happy ending here, just mystery. no profound life lessons, just a couple of horny and intelligent kids exploring the ability to feel the most irrational and unrealistic of feelings...... romantic love.10 out of 10 watch it with your special lady and recommend it to a stranger................",10,1,2,22 May 2005
The Deer Hunter," #15 on my personal top 100
","I love watching the Deer Hunter. It's neither pro nor anti war. It's a movie about some budies that go Deer Hunting one last time before they go to Veitnam and how they are changed when they come back. If you want to see acting see this movie. Robert DeNiro, Christopher Walken, John Cazale, Meryl Streep, and John Savage all put in flawless performances. This is a man's man's movie that will make most men cry. Watch it with a cold Rolling Rock (DeNiro's beer of choice in the movie) The Russian Roulette scenes are as cool as they are emotional. This is the shattered dream of when you're an 8 year old boy. Going off to war with your budies. But this ain't no dream. This is this!!!!!!",10,0,1,10 March 1999
The Matrix," layered, textured, somewhat intelligent future of sci fi
","i love this movie for the manny many themes that come up repeatedly. The story's arch is quite good in that it doesn't feel as though much of anything else could be added. The central philosophy is admirably brought to a movie that a mainstream audience can digest, along with metaphorical and allegorical strains of the bible, alice in wonderland, drug use, the life cycle, cartesian dualism, buddhist one consciousness, giger style enemies, artificial intelligence, newtonian physics, orwellian nightmares, and euclidean view of the world as a series of numbers and probabilities. Sci fi need not be the same old, evil monster chase humans without rhyme or reason. The movie dooes sidestep charecter development by making it's charecters not know who they are, and also by killing most of them off as soon as they are met. while this isn't the arty pretentious greatness of citizen kane or waking life, it is a movie that is likely to be long remembered and worshipped like Star Wars",10,5,10,19 October 2003
Casino," Tough guy, you and your brotha'! No more!
","This is my favorite mob movie. Say what you will about Goodfellas, this is better. The documentary style filming by Martin Scorcese during the first 40 minutes delves deep into the inner workings of a mob run casino. The first 40 minutes is brilliant. From there the movie chronicles Ace Rothstein's marriage, his business of running the casino, his hitman pal Nicky Santaro, and his wife's affair with Nicky. I really, really love Robert DeNiro and here he has a great supporting cast: Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone, Don Rickles, James Woods, and Frank Vincent. All of them put on great performances. I love mob movies anyways but this one rocks. It's got a great soundtrack. Frank Vincent and Joe Pesci steal the show with the two best characters. And the ending scene of Joe Pesci and his brother being beaten to death with baseball bats in a corn field then buried alive to the tune of Eric Burdon's 'The House Of The Rising Sun' is probably five of my most favorite minutes in film ever. And it will give you nightmares. I have the soundtrack, I have the movie. They both rule. #7 on my top 100 favorite movies.",10,1,2,18 March 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," #17 movie of all time according to me
","If you don't know the plot to Star Wars please bludgeon yourself to death. If you've never seen it, crawl out from underneath your rock,and if you've never heard of it,chances are (A) you're not reading this (B) you can't read because you're an aboriginal warrior from Tonga (C) you're an idiot OR (D) all of the above. That's right D as in Darth as in Vader. I'm no Star Wars freak but I do love the movie a lot. But as a true fan of Star Wars I must bash those who are such fans of the movie that they try to fill in details about characters in the movie, that were only in the movie 2.5 seconds. Leave the movie alone guys, get lives, don't ad lib to genius. Only George Lucas has the right to ad lib to HIS movie. Thank you.",10,0,0,18 March 1999
Cube," Pandora's Box
",Stop. Before you think about what this movie means. Why are we here? What are we supposed to do about it? How do we master our own personalities and Why the Hell is everything so terrifying? How did we get here? Can we all get along for everyone's benefit?All questions you might ask yourself in the real world. The cube is merely a small test model version of the earth. And everything works out as if in the real world. Kind of a Lord Of The Flies type experiment. And that are looking for a way out of the Cube.Endless human stupidity on the inside and outside of the cube.,Null,1,1,22 May 2000
Sin City," eat your heart out mickey spillane
","having only recently been indoctrinated into the callous world of the sin city comics, i wasn't sure that i would be able to judge the movie fairly. months earlier when i first read them, i loved the overall feel and pace to them and friends and i would discuss how a movie version of this should go off. as information became more available i became more assured that the movie would be great. Robert Rodriguez as director? super. mickey Rourke as Marv? bonanza! but still an inkling of fear remained that the ratings board would nueter the film and derail the overall quality. surprise surprise when this movie came out pound for pound every bit as violent as Natural Born Killlers (a movie that had an infinite amount of problems with the fascist MPAA) and yet raised not an eyebrow.then the film comes out on April fools day. what a set up. i must say that i have not been this impressed with a comic book movie since the first batman in 1989. robert rodriguez met and exceeded all expectations by dogmatically adhering to the novels themselves. the movie was born free of director and actor ego that often muddles good work. performances by Rourke, Willis, Alba, and the rest are exactly right. the look and feel of the film is wonderful. the violence is far enough over the top and the female nudity sprinkled generously enough that a warm feeling settled in my stomach by movie's end i like the wittle wittle movie oh course, said nudity and violence does seem to slow by the end to a crawl but i think the director planned it that way to reverse the common action picture logic of a final build up of violence/chase sequence/confrontation et cetera. here instead the violence is unleash from the word go, and then the movie changes gears and the director says, 'okay, you've seen this, now look at this'.brilliant ten out of ten and hey i'm one of the first voters",9,0,1,2 April 2005
Moon," what a find!!!
","Went into this movie knowing nothing about it. that's probably the way to go. considering how most people i've met have never heard of this, that shouldn't be too difficult. Sam Rockwell gives the performance of a lifetime. The movie is completely thought out and actualized. It plays very very well with emotions while telling a believable sci-fi story. It's often said that Tarkovsky was the master of this but i've seen his movies and i understand the limitation placed on him by the soviets, still his movies are boring and TOO contemplative. this movie manages a great balancing act of entertainment, action, thought provoking, and caring. it's a shame more people haven't heard of it. 9/10",9,0,1,19 September 2018
True Romance," You're an eggplant!
","There's so many great things here to say that it's hard to know where to start! Quentin Tarantino is the writer that's always a great foundation. There is an all star cast lead by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette in their career best performances. Dennis Hopper (Easy Rider, Speed) and Christopher Walken (The Deer Hunter, Dogs Of War) eat up their 10 minutes of screen time in the greatest psychological confrontation in movie history. Val Kilmer (Top Secret), Chris Penn (Reservoir Dogs), Brad Pitt (12 Monkeys, Interveiw With A Vampire), Samuel L Jackson (Pulp Fiction, Jurassic Park), Michael Rappaport (Higher Learning), Tom Sizemore (Natural Born Killers), Gary Oldman (The Professional) and Bronson Pinchot all throw out some of the best performances in their careers into tiny parts. A simply stuuning Mexican stand-off and shoot out towards the end is one of the best gun fights in movie history. Great writing produces many, many memorable lines. Confrontations between Christian Slater and Gary Oldman, Patricia Arquette and James Gandolfini, and Brad Pitt vs anybody produce classic scene after classic scene. A great soundtrack, great story, and great cinematography boost this movie even higher. Plus trademark Tarantino style pop-culture references give it even more appeal. This movie is awesome. Probably perfect in every way. #9 on my all-time top 100 movies! See it!",10,1,2,24 March 1999
Back to the Future," classic 80's , it's even got Micheal J Fox
","If Sigmund Frued saw this movie he'd be foaming and frothing at the mouth about it's  latent theme of having your mom wanting you in a sexual way. Cokehead theories aside this is one of those movies that sums up the 80's quite nicely. Between Micheal J Fox and Huey Luis and the News on the soundtrack you can't get much more 80's. It's another movie like Ghostbusters that you watch as a kid, then see as an adult and notice alot of adult themed jokes you didn't even notice as jokes as a kid. 'I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts' That line never did make sense when I was ten.",7,3,6,2 July 2002
Jurassic Park," You can bet Jurassic's good!
","I love Jurassic Park. Most people complain about the acting. I thought the acting was adequete. Like a lot of people I usually don't like big budget computer graphics movies. This is an exception. Most people hate the plot. I thought it passed for good. Jurassic Park is a really great movie. I saw it more times in the theater then any other movie ever. Seven in all. It can be watched and enjoyed on the small screen but much like Star Wars, Pink Flyod's The Wall, and Saving Private Ryan it can only fully be appreciated on the big big screen. The special effects in this movie may never be equalled. Sure it's standard monster movie stuff but who's kidding who here. What is the main reason to see the movie. If you don't like the rest do something better yourself. Me I give it a 9 out of ten rating. Watch it with Godzilla (1954) for added fun.",9,3,4,11 May 1999
Beetlejuice," Beetlejuice! Beetlejuice! Beetlejuice!
","Tim Burton's most twisted nightmarish movie ever is a hilarious high water mark for late eighties comedy. A great cast puts in wonderful performances. Baldwin, Davis, O'Hara, Jones, Goulet, Ryder, and especially Keaton in his most memorable charecter. Great writing, cinematography, and good special effects highlight this film. Not very many movies as original as this. I personally credit Winona Ryder's character for starting the Gothic dress trend among today's teenagers. Lots of good lines, mostly delivered by Keaton in the title charecter. Stark imagery in set design lasts long after you've seen the movie. I give it 8.5 out of 10. Want a Zagnut?",9,0,1,13 May 1999
The Wizard of Oz," This is what a bad hit of acid does to you.
","Okay, lets go over Dorothy's story one last time. She's a flying witch riding a bicycle, her house falls out of the sky into a magical place named Oz filled with lots of 'colors' because it's over the rainbow. Oz is populated by a bunch of singing midgets called munchkins and they tell her to follow the yellow brick road where she meets a bunch of wacked-out characters that also sing and she has to fight off an evil witch and talking trees and flying monkeys so that she can see the great and powerful wizard (Timothy Leary) of Oz who can send her back to Kansas (cause it's so exciting there) via hot air balloon, but he fails so she clicks her ruby slippers together and wakes up. Just between you me and the wall I'd say Dorothy's been playing in the old mushroom patch again. This movie is okay when you're a kid but when you grow up you realize that it fits right in with Pink Flyod's the Wall, Dumbo, and Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas. I got three little letters to some up this movie L S D. I think you hear me knocking.",6,3,19,21 May 1999
Evil Dead II," A look through the eyes of a truly insane man
","This is my theory on Evil Dead 2. I believe the whole, or most of the movie is told from an insane killer's perspective. Looking at life through the eyes of a nutball. A demented man thinks zombies are killing his friends. When in actuality he's doing it. When he finally figures out that he is responsible for at least one of those murders he says a book made him do it. He buries the bodies of his victims and continues on in his demented little world. He does thing and sees things only a truly truly insane person would. Would a sane man cut off his own hand? Would a sane man see bookshelves and clocks laughing at him. Would a sane man think that little versions of himself are out to kill him. Ash is obviously a paranoid delusional schizophrenic with suicidal tendencies. Sam Raimi slyly makes it look as though Ash believes all this is happening to him but in actuality he is probably a loner cabin dweller gone off the deep end. But it's really violent and really really really funny. #24 on my top 100.",10,1,2,18 March 1999
The Godfather," This is a movie you can't refuse.

If somebody ever names me Godfather to their child, I'll be too tempted to give them a horse's head. Vito Andolini Corleone, his sons MIcheal, Santino,and Fredo, his friends Sal and Peter. What a collection of hooligans. This isn't a great movie.It's a perfect movie.",10,1,3,15 March 1999
