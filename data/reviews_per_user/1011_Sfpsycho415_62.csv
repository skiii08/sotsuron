The Blair Witch Project," Horrifyingly boring ---3/10
","I watched this movie because of the interesting premise and my love of mystery. But what i got was a boring, headache-inducing, unscary piece of crap. It takes an hour into the only 86 minute film for anything the least bit interesting to happen. The constantly shaking camera gave me a huge head-ache. There was nothing really scary about it. A couple of noises and the three idiots going around in circles is not scary. Speaking of the three idiots, the acting was weak and all they did was scream at each other and the darkness. They didn't die soon enough. the last few minutes were decent but not nearly enough to save this trash. The Blair Witch Project is a highly-overrated snore-o-rama that should have never come out of the woods.---3/10",3,1,3,11 March 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Almost as Good As The First Half---7/10
","Kill Bill Vol. 2 kicks some serious ass for almost it's whole running time. The only flaw is the disappointing fight with Bill. But there is so much good stuff here, it's pretty much forgivable. There is the great fight with Elle which tore the house down. Literally. We also finally get to see Budd played by Michael Madsen. His scenes were some of the best in both movies. And then there is quite possibly one of the scariest and most exciting scenes ever involving the Bride being buried alive. Having a fear of suffocation myself, this scene was extra effective.The acting was excellent all around. Uma Thurman proves she is not only hot and deadly, but that she is also one of the best actresses today. She is especially good toward the end. Micheal Madsen is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors. He always gives a great performance. Darryl Hannah is superb as the sole female assassin in Vol.2, and David Carradine is great as Bill himself. It's just too bad we don't get to see some more of his fight skills. Still, Vol.2 is a great second half to an instant classic. 7/10",7,0,1,26 April 2004
Mission: Impossible III," A solid action picture to start the summer season-------7/10
","The 2006 summer season kicks off to a pretty good start with the release of Mission Impossible III, the last(?) installment of the billion dollar grossing franchise. Tom Cruise, who's name is becoming synonymous withe the word 'blockbuster', reprises his role as IMF agent Ethan Hunt, this time tracking down an arms dealer played well by recent Oscar winner Philip Seymour Hoffman. The action and thrills are non-stop, even though some are hit or miss. The beginning and ending action sequences are somewhat blah, while the middle is chock full of fun and exciting scenes, especially the infiltration of the Vatican. My biggest gripe is that the start and end are not up to par with the rest of the film. They seem more like a TV episode, with the set up of the bad guy and the spic and span ending. Still, this is a great flick to catch in theaters since this summers slate isn't that great besides X3 and Pirates 2. This mission will self-destruct in 5 seconds. (Sorry i always wanted to say that.) 7/10",7,0,2,6 May 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," For real Star Wars fans only---8/10
","While critics and purists alike were bashing Phantom Menace, real Star Wars fans like myself were jumping for joy as a new adventure in that galaxy far, far away hit the big screen. The film tells the story of the younger Obi-wan Kenobi and how he and his Master Qui-Gon discover a ten year old Anakin Skywalker. Ewan McGregor fits in Obi-wan's boots very nicely and Liam Neeson is perfect as Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn. But the real star here is Darth Maul, played by the extraordinary Ray Park. With his double-edged lightsaber, gravity-defying acrobatics, and wicked Sith tattoos, Maul clocks in as one of the baddest villains in the Star Wars universe. The handicap lightsaber fight near the end of the film is the best in the saga (although this might change with Episode III). And of course i have to mention John Williams amazing new score. Star Wars just wouldn't be the same without it's wonderful music.Now, there are some problems, i will admit. Jar Jar Binks is annoying as hell. I guess kids like him, though. I also didn't like how characters kept accidentally beating the enemy, like when a blaster gets caught on Jar Jar's foot and keeps firing or how Anakin is just pushing random buttons in his fighter and blew up a whole ship.These are annoying but forgivable flaws in an otherwise great adventure. Cynics be damned, Star Wars still rules!--8/10",8,0,2,28 July 2001
Ali," Great film although a little long.---7/10
","The only flaw i have with this film is the scenes that don't know when to stop such as when Ali is running through a village in Zaire. Other than that this a beautifully filmed, incredibly acted, and superbly directed film. Will Smith captured Muhammad Ali's passion and fury to a fault. He even imitated some of Ali's moves excellently. Jamie Foxx played Drew 'Bundini' Brown, Ali's troubled cornerman. Although a comedic character, he has some scenes which are quite serious and moving. Also, the heart of the comedic part of the movie was Jon Voight's portrayal of Howard Cossel which he did great in. When i went to see this movie, the audience started to applaud during scenes of the film as well as at the end. See it in theaters. 7/10",7,0,1,27 December 2001
The Ring," Overrated----3/10
","The Ring is based on an earlier Japanese that was probably better than this. It follows a woman who comes into the possession of a tape that's viewers die after seven days. She then goes on a quest to find the origins of the tape before it kills again. Oooh. The storyline sounds like a bad TV movie on the Sci-Fi channel The American version is full of loud noises at the beginning of a scene that is supposed to be scary. There are parts where a bunch of people in the audience jump and i didn't even blink. There were some creepy shots and some intentional and unintentional funny moments which saved it from being a total loss. Still, i would recommend Red Dragon instead. 3/10",3,0,0,26 October 2002
Minority Report," Much better than i expected---8/10
","When i saw the commercials for this movie, i really didn't think it looked all that good. I thought it looked cheesy and dialouge impaired. The quotes 'You don't have to run' followed by ' You don't have to chase me' made me want to hurl. Plus i am not a huge Tom Cruise fan. The only other movie if his that i liked was Top Gun. Yet underneath all the cheese of this flick is a well written and smart story,and incredible special effects. And Steven Spielberg's vision of the future is amazing. The film follows a cop in the future. He is part of the Pre-Crime force, a special team who uses psychics to predict crimes and stop them before they happen. When John (Cruise) sees that he is the one who commits a crime, he is one the run. Other than some bad dialouge and sometimes cheesy acting, this is a great sci-fi flick. 8/10",8,0,0,30 June 2002
The Fifth Element," Great Futuristic Adventure--- 8/10
","Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich, Gary Oldman and Chris Tucker star in this action-adventure sprinkled with comedy about a futuristic New York cab driver who is called up to save the world. Sounds stupid, i know. But it is actually a well-made adventure with great special effects, cool action scenes, and hilarious performances especially by Milla Jovovich and Chris Tucker. Gary Oldman again plays a bad guy with perfection and Tucker is hysterical but that goes without saying. Luc Besson's vision of the future is funny and fascinating at the same time. If you're looking to forget your troubles and have a good time, this is good choice. 8/10",8,0,1,16 September 2003
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Great ending to a great trilogy----8/10
","The Star Wars trilogy comes to an end here and, while it is the fourth best of the saga in my opinion, it is still one of the best films ever made. The final fight between Luke and Vader is great and the space battle between the Empire and Rebellion is amazing. There are some flaws, however, that keep it from being equal to the first two. The new Death Star is kind of disappointing. I wish they used their obviously incredible imaginations to come up with a better home base. Some of the coolest bad guys are defeated in stupid ways. Don't even get me started on how Boba Fett gets beaten. And while the Ewoks are cute and cuddly, i would have preferred Wookies or some kind of big warriors for the final battle. These are really minor complaints be cause the action is awesome and the Emperor and Han Solo are great. But of course Vader rules them all. This action-packed space adventure is a great ending to an amazing trilogy. 8/10",8,0,1,22 October 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A great addition to the Star Wars saga---8/10
","Another excellent film in the best movie series ever, Attack of the Clones attacks your senses with stunning visuals, great action, and amazing music. The story takes place a decade after Episode I. Anakin is learning the ways of the Jedi from Obi-Wan and falls in love with Padme, and a sith named Count Dooku creates a separatist army to fight the Republic. Hayden Christensen steps into the role of Anakin Skywalker, and while he isn't the most experienced actor, i thought he did a good job of showing Anakin's innocence and his brushes with dark side. Ewan McGregor was the perfect choice to play a younger Obi-Wan, and he continues to prove it here, with just the right amount of smart-ass lines. The action scenes are pretty damn cool, too. Jango Fett's duel with Obi-wan on the ocean world is one of the cooler scenes, and the huge battle between the clones and the droids near the end is jaw-dropping. The lightsaber duels this time around don't quite match the show Darth maul puts on in Episode I, but we do finally get to see Yoda in action. And he is freakin awesome for being 2 feet tall. The crowd went nuts when i saw it in the theater.I don't see why the prequels get a bad rap. I guess fans hyped them up to be better than the originals (which is nearly impossible) and then they can't be satisfied. Poor fools.---8/10",8,0,1,1 June 2002
The Godfather: Part II," Excellence: Part II----9/10
","The Godfather Part II continues the story of Michael Corleone and fills the background of Vito Corleone. Robert De Niro shines as Vito from his days in old New York. In some ways, I like Godfather better than Part II, but Robert De Niro's performance makes me rethink that. Al Pacino does great again as Michael and the same with John Cazale's Fredo, and Francis Ford Coppola shows why he is one of the best directors ever. In this second chapter, Michael gains complete control of the family and must find a traitor in their midsts. And we go back to the early 1900's New York and follow a young Vito's childhood and early adulthood. I think this is where the movie really picks up. Vito has always been my favorite (besides Sonny) so it was amazing to see his past. The movie does go on a little long and it slows up once in a while, but that is the only minor flaw. This is cinema at it's best. 9/10",9,0,1,3 August 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Good movie but not the masterpiece it's being hailed as---7/10
","While Fellowship of the Ring is a good adventure movie, i also think it is very overrated. It doesn't hold a candle to A New Hope. The first part of the trilogy gets off to a slow start as we meet the characters who will soon become the fellowship. It picks up speed when the faceless, hood-wearing, horsemen come looking for the ring. There are some great action scenes that follow and an exciting cliffhanger at the end. I own this, the Two Towers, and will own Return of the King because they are good movies. But masterpieces they are not. They get slow at times, become cheesy at other times, and the acting is not top of the line. I'd give the whole trilogy a 7 out of 10. No more, no less. 7/10",7,21,44,11 March 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," A Great Ending---7/10
","Upon first leaving the theater, i was disappointed in the final installment of the Matrix trilogy. As I started to read up on it, however, I realized it made perfect sense to end it the way they did. I don't like writing spoilers, so i'll avoid that. I'll just say don't judge it right away. Let the whole trilogy sink in and it will all make perfect sense. The fight scenes are just as good as ever, but the battle on Zion was a little long and sometimes repetitive. It did feature some great action, though. There are plenty of tense moments and some unforeseen events that will catch you off guard. Hugo Weaving does the best job and plays the coolest character in the entire trilogy in Agent Smith and his many, many clones. This movie is very good but the original Matrix is still my favorite. If you didn't like Reloaded, you probably won't like this one. I think it is a well made trilogy and one that should be seen, because as soon as you understand it, the Matrix has you. 7/10",7,18,35,10 November 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Excellent---8/10
","I was going in with low expectations like everyone else. I knew i would be entertained but i didn't think it would be a good entry into the Terminator series. Oh was i ever wrong. This movie was fantastic. In it, Arnold is back again as the futuristic cyborg who must protect John Conner (Nick Stahl) from a robot assassin, this time played by Kristanna Loken. Arnold is back in the role that made him Ahnold. Kristanna Loken is a great villain (Not to mention super hot). She is no T-1000, though the action sequences were incredible and their were some unexpected twists that caught everyone in the theater off-guard. Everyone is crying about how James Cameron isn't involved, but i think Jonathon Mostow did a superb job. If there is a Terminator 4, i won't complain, even though it is not necessary. 8/10",8,0,0,8 July 2003
The Shining," One of the scariest movies ever---8/10
","I was never a big fan of horror movies. They usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy children. They usually lack originality and contain overacting galore. The only horror movie i like was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. It was well-acted, and had a great story. But it has been joined and maybe even surpassed by Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, quite possibly the scariest movie ever.The movie follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter. There were rumors of the place being haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family. But Jack is convinced it will be OK and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer's block. After months of solitude and silence however, Jack becomes a grumpy and later violent. Is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad?One of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that Kubrick makes. The hotel is very silent, and the rooms are huge, yet always empty. It is also eerily calm when Jack's son is riding his bike through the barren hallways. Jack Nicholson's performance is also one of his very best, scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile. My favorite scene is when he is talking to a ghost from inside a walk-in refrigerator.The Shining is tops for horror movies in my opinion, beating the snot out of crap like the Ring and The Blair Witch Project. It may be a oldie, but is definitely a goodie. 8/10",8,205,337,28 February 2005
Apocalypse Now," A little overrated, but pretty good----7/10
","I started watching Apocalypse Now with all the acclaim it has received over the years in the back of my mind. I learned a long time ago with 2001: A Space Odyssey that just because a movie is regarded as a classic doesn't mean i will like it at all. I sat down to watch the Redux (it was the only version i could get but i'm sure the overall film is the same) and fortunately, Apocalypse Now is better than 2001, but it is not a great movie.The film stars Martin Sheen as an Army captain who is sent into deep into the jungles of Vietnam to take down a decorated general (Marlon Brando) who went mad and barricaded himself. He rides on a boat with a squad of desensitized soldiers down a river. Along for the ride is a barely legal youngster (Laurence Fishburne), a would-be chef (Frederick Forrest) and a stern driver (Albert Hall). Everybody in the cast does a great job, and the ride down the river is eerily calm with random spurts of violence which makes for a mostly exciting movie. There is also a great supporting role by Robert Duvall as a hard-ass commander who is a overzealous fan of surfing.The movie really slows down, however, when the squad comes across a French family living in a nice house in the middle of the jungle. It really doesn't do much for the story and it seems to get forgotten in the later parts of the movie. Also, the ending is slow and just strange. I heard there was originally supposed to be a huge battle, which i would have preferred.For movie fans, Apocalypse Now is a must-see, because most people like it a lot, but for some it is a pretty good war movie that's worth a look.---7/10",7,5,10,4 February 2005
Face_Off," The best action film of all time!----10/10
","Action movies are one of my very favorite genres. The excitement in them is unmatched, and the heroes and villains at the heart of them are so darn cool. Well, this goes for the great action movies anyway, most of which came out between 1987 and 1997, a ten year period i like to call, 'The Action Movie Revolution'. It started with Lethal Weapon. It went on to include such classics as Die Hard, Bad Boys, the Rock, and Con Air. And it ended with Face/Off.John Woo's Face/Off has to be, in my opinion, the best action movie ever made. The action is non-stop, cool and original. The story line is one of a kind, with a hint of science fiction, but true to it's action origins. And the two leads, John Travolta and Nicolas Cage pull of some incredible movie magic by transforming from good to evil and back again with amazing convincement.When the movie starts, John Travolta plays Sean Archer, an FBI agent who is trailing the terrorist that killed his son. Nicolas Cage plays said terrorist, Castor Troy, a diabolical killer with a taste for women and Chicklets. But after supposedly killing Troy, Archer goes under a cutting edge surgery (no pun intended) to transform into Troy (even putting in a phony voicebox that produces his rival's voice) to infiltrate his organization and take down his buddies in crime. But soon afterward, the real Troy, who was being kept alive long enough to preserve his face, awakens and forces the doctors to turn him into Archer. So now it's Travolta playing Troy playing Archer, and Cage playing Archer playing Troy.If this sounds like a horrible, convoluted storyline, it's because it is. But when it is on screen, it makes more sense. Not to mention it is surrounded by a tons of awesome shootouts directed by action master Woo, a wicked speedboat chase, an amazing cast of top-notch actors, and a great soundtrack. This is the last great action movie and nothing after it has come close. That's why we should give the CGI a rest and get back to blowing s**t up the right way. 10/10",10,3,5,23 December 2004
Collateral," One of the best movies this year---9/10
","Collateral is one of the best films of 2004. Now i admit, i haven't seen too many this year. But there just wasn't much to see. Collateral is a movie i have been looking forward to for some time because it goes back to the days where a movie can take place in the current times and not feature CGI armies clashing while orchestra music plays. It is about characters, plot twists, and atmosphere. These are the elements that suck you into a movie. And Michael Mann know it. Not to mention he has a great cast to work with. In probably his best work to date, Tom Cruise plays Vincent, a hit-man with an itinerary that must be cleared before dawn. I always knew Cruise was a good actor, apparent in movies like Top Gun, Minority Report, and A Few Good Men (in which he was especially good). But i never knew he could pull of an outstanding performance, and yet he does just that in Collateral. Who knew he just had to try being a bad guy for once? He did receive a little help from Jaime Foxx, who plays cab driver Max, Vincent's unwilling hostage. Foxx's equally impressive performance plays off of Cruise's and vice versa. I knew Jaime Foxx could be a great actor when i saw him in Ali, also by Michael Mann.The script is full of great dialogue, ('Don't do anything stupid. You don't have the trunk space') and plenty of tense situations that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The shootout in the disco, the mugging of Max while tied to the steering wheel, and max trying to pass as a hit-man himself are all classic scenes that i can watch over and over. This is a slickly directed, superbly acted, and nail-bitingly suspenseful film. It's one of the best movies i have seen in a long time. And it's got a Tom Cruise violently killing people. What more could you ask for? 9/10",9,3,4,15 September 2004
Dark City," Great sci-fi movie----8/10
","I didn't even hear about this movie until a couple of months ago when i really got into science-fiction movies. I am glad i was able to pick up a copy for less than eight bucks because it was a huge bargain for a great movie. Dark City follows a guy who wakes up in bathtub and finds a dead body in the next room. He then discovers he is wanted for a bunch of other murders. The catch is he doesn't remember a thing. I don't wanna say to much because you should really see it for yourself. Rufus Sewell (who i had never heard of) Kiefer Sutherland, Jennifer Connelly (yummy) and William Hurt all give great performances (the best though is from Richard O'Brien who plays the enigmatic and downright cool Mr. Hand), but the i think the real stars are the writers who make an original plot with plenty of clever twists and dialogue, and the set and graphic designers who make one of the coolest looking cities i have ever seen. If you love sci-fi and have never seen this movie before, i think you should check it out. 8/10",8,0,2,22 September 2004
American History X," Powerful and insightful---9/10
","In American History X, a reformed neo-nazi named Derek (Edward Norton) returns home from prison intending to stop his little brother Danny (Edward Furlong), already a member, from following in his footsteps. A story that i am sure has happened a thousand times in real-life, whether it involve neo-Nazis, gangs, or drug addiction. As sad as that is, it sure spawned one of the most powerful movies i have ever seen.Edward Norton gives one of the best performances ever, and the best from the year 1998. I've said it before and i'll say it again: The Academy sucks. Norton is totally convincing and at times sympathetic. Not to mention, he got pretty damn built for this role. Edward Furlong is also very good as the little brother on the edge, and Stacy Keach is great as the evil head of the group.Director Tony Kaye tells the story by having Norton's nazi days in black and white flashbacks, and the present day where Norton is freed from prison and his hatred in color. This makes it not only easier to distinguish the past and present scenes, but it somehow makes the scenes more effective. Like Norton saw everything in black and white until he had a tragic experience in prison.American History X is a powerful, insightful, and very relevant tale of hatred and tragedy, and a film that should be seen by everyone, especially these days. 9/10",9,1,2,26 January 2005
Alien vs. Predator," A major disappointment---6/10
","I was really looking forward to an all out Alien vs. Predator clash of the titans, complete with decapitated alien heads and exploding predator torsos. What i got was a kinda decent flick, but with really only one or two fights that were pretty good, but just too few and far between. Another thing that brought the movie down was it's PG-13 rating. It really held back what could have been a classic. Especially, after four R-rated Aliens movies and two R-rated Predator movies. Also, the movie ran about 100 minutes, but the writers tried to develop the human characters when they should have had more of the monster face/offs. Nobody came to see Alien vs. Predator to see the humans. Except to see them die violently. Overall, it may be worth a rent to see the title characters fight, and be introduced to a new badass Predator. Otherwise, it is a disappointment. 6/10",6,0,2,21 January 2005
Meet the Fockers," Not bad, but not hilarious---6/10
","Meet the Fockers is a sequel to the 2000 hit comedy Meet the Parents, starring Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller. This second installment follows Greg (Stiller), his fiancée (Teri Polo), her dad (De Niro) and her mom (Blythe Danner) as they go on a road trip to meet Greg's parents (Dustin Hoffman and Barabara Streisand). Some form of comedy ensues when Greg's parents turn out liberal, while his future parents in-law are conservative.The sequel, of course, fails to be as funny as the original. In fact, i didn't get a belly laugh during the entire film. However, it was entertaining enough that i had a smile on my face throughout, i giggled pretty often, and i did laugh once or twice. Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman were the stars here and delivered the funniest moments of the film. Ben Stiller had his moments, as well. Watch for the part after he is injected with truth serum by De Niro.I think this movie would have been a lot better without Barabara Streisand. Nothing she did or said was amusing. They should have cast somebody else. Anybody would have been better. Also, a lot of the jokes in the movie just weren't funny. Still, this could be an entertaining rental if you liked the original. 6/10",6,0,1,9 January 2005
Saving Private Ryan," An excellent war movie.---8/10
","Saving Private Ryan has been out for damn near seven years and i just saw it for the first time yesterday. And i must say it is pretty damn great. The combat scenes are the best i have seen in any World War II movie, especially the amazing opening scene on the beaches of Normandy. They are full of exciting and grisly action and speed along the three-hour runtime. Ryan is also packed with a great cast who all give excellent performances especially Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, and Jeremy Davies. Heck, even Vin Diesel was good. Yes i said Vin Diesel. Maybe he just gets bad scripts lately.The only things keeping this from being the best war movie ever is it's sappy storyline and one-sidedness. Nobody is saying the Nazis are saints, but their foot soldiers were there for the exact same reasons the American foot soldiers were. Their stupid leaders sent them there.Saving Private Ryan is still one of the best war movies of all time. It's explosive action and great acting keeps it interesting throughout its runtime and it proves that Steven Spielberg can make a darn entertaining flick. 8/10",8,1,3,5 January 2005
The Transporter," Way Better than Triple X----7/10
","I hear people saying how Triple X is the best action movie of the year and what not, which isn't saying much seeing how their were not too many action flicks to begin with. But The Transporter blew away the competition. It has a much cooler story to begin with. It follows a professional courier of illegal goods who breaks the first rule of transportation: never open the package. Fortunatley, the package he opens contains a beautiful kidnappee. Unfortuantley for him, he now has the police, his clients, and others on his tail. Jason Statham is amazing-despite the obvious exaggerations that come with all action films- and Qi Shu is incredibly tasty. The action sequences are the best i have seen in a long time, especially the hand to hand combat and the opening and closing chases. This is a great action film. 7/10",7,0,0,12 October 2002
X-Men: The Last Stand," Don't believe the Ratner haters! X3 might be the best mutant-fest yet!----8/10
","While most people will have you believe that X3 is crap compared based on the fact the Brett Ratner isn't as universally praised as Bryan Singer (director of the first two X movies and The Usual Suspects), i can tell you the Ratner's kinetic and fast-paced style makes 'The Last Stand' a little different but just as good as the other X-Men films. I had heard of all the reasons TLS was getting negative buzz. Let's go through a few of them and i'll tell you what i think (if you care):-Too many mutants, not enough depth- I thought all the mutants was a good thing. Many appearances and they all got some action. The only real thing you need to know about the characters is who's side their on and what their power is. If everyone of them had a backstory, the film would clock in at about 5 and half hours.-Bad acting, writing, and directing- This movie has the same actors who give the same great performances they always did, especially the great team of Sir Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart. The writing is smart and funny like always. The action is done well, especially the huge final battle.You have a destroyed Golden Gate Bridge, flying and flaming cars, needle shooting grenade launchers, and a huge swinging blue furball. Some dramatic scenes hit all the emotional targets. There were some cheesy moments, but it's a comic book movie.-Some characters die- So? That makes it exciting. You don't know who is gonna drop next.-Lame ending- Are you serious? The ending with Magneto is the best ending of the year, signifying that all is not back to 'normal'. And stay tuned after the credits, for one of the best epilogues ever.Sorry, i'm not seeing what people are complaining about. If Bryan Singer directed this movie the exact same way there would be no complaints. Brett Ratner knows how to make entertaining movies (Rush Hour, Red Dragon) and people need to get off his back. (By the way Brett, i'll pretend like After the Sunset never existed.)Catch the movie in theaters, forget what you heard, and enjoy for yourself. 8/10",8,0,3,31 May 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Best of the trilogy---7/10
","The Two Towers continues the story from the Fellowship of the Ring, but it has a lot more action. The first one took a while to get started and didn't have many epic battles. Regardless, it was a great movie. The second installment has got much more action and the end battle at Helm's deep is amazing. The cast and crew still do an excellent job with acting and special effects. I do have a couple of complaints. The movie didn't continue the story as much as it could have. Other than Gollum becoming a more important character, you probably could have skipped this one and caught up quickly in the third film, but you would have missed out on some great scenes. I also did not like the walking-talking trees. I found them boring and a little irritating as they didn't do much. Other than those forgivable flaws, this is a fantastic adventure that makes you drool in anticipation for the conclusion. 7/10",7,0,0,31 August 2003
The Incredibles," Good family flick----7/10
","While i usually steer clear of family movies, this one had a certain appeal. Not enough for me to pay to see it, but enough that i could watch it for free. And i had a good time. The Incredibles follows a family of superheroes who come out of retirement to save the world. Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, and Samuel L. Jackson provide great voice work, and and some of the flick's funnier moments. I was also pleasantly surprised that the action scenes were entertaining, including a battle with a robot that was much better than the crappy idiotic fights from Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. The film has some amazing visuals, some of which i thought might have been real. The team behind it, Pixar, also made one of the only family movies i really love, Toy Story.As much fun as the movie is, it gets a little slow at some points if your not under 12 years old, and the story is almost non-existent. Still, it is a great movie to watch on a big-screen or with the little kiddies, but nothing to replace a nice R-rated gangster/action/porno/comedy/documentary. 7/10",7,1,3,5 March 2005

","If I rated movies based only on visuals and technical achievements, Children of Men would be one of the greatest movies ever. The single take action sequences are flawless in execution and near-future Britain looks amazing. Everything from the cars to the bombed-out buildings, to the beautiful locales is great. Also, the concept of an infertile human race is intriguing and original.However, i failed to make a connection with any of the characters, making it harder to really care what happens to them. I haven't put my finger on why i didn't care for the characters. I think it's because they didn't seem real enough to me. They seemed very written. Clive Owen did a fine job in the leading role and i actually did care a bit about him, and Michael Caine was kinda fun, but other than that, the characters seemed like they didn't even care that they found a key to to saving humanity.Perhaps on a second viewing, which i am totally not against, i'll see something i missed and make a more emotional investment in the film. Until then, I'll watch V for Vendetta again. 7/10",7,7,12,27 March 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Best Movie So Far This Year!----8/10
","A refreshing and very original movie is what we always expect from Quentin Tarantino and that is just what he delivered. This year was full of generic action movies and sorry sequels. Maybe that fact made Kill Bill seem better. Either way, this movie kicks ass. Tarantino mixes his love of Japanese and Chinese action movies, spaghetti westerns, and even a little anime to craft his own action masterpiece. Uma Thurman is outstanding and the rest of cast is great especially Sonny Chiba. The action sequences are just as good if not better than those from The Matrix, and done without the help of loads of computer effects. Some say the film may have been better if it wasn't split in two, but the cliff-hanger ending was done excellently and makes you mark your calender for the second half. This movie is sure to be an instant classic and a great new addition into Tarantino's wild and crazy family. 8/10",8,0,1,13 October 2003
Black Hawk Down," Excellent war movie---8/10
","Non-stop action, great acting and a good soundtrack round out another great package for Jerry Bruckheimer. I liked most of his movies except for Pearl Harbor. Black Hawk Down is a fact-based story which follows an elite group of U.S. rangers who are on a peacekeeping mission in Mogadishu when there are attacked by the rebels. Ewan McGregor, Josh Hartnett and Tom Sizemore are a part of the great cast which also includes great turns by Ewen Bremner (Trainspotting) and William Fichtner (Armageddon) Bullets are always flying in this flick whether in the background or the fore front. Even though this movie might create more hostility in America against Muslims, this is a great movie that should not be missed in theaters. 8/10",8,0,0,19 January 2002
Saw," One of the best horror/thrillers since The Shining, and possibly the best ending ever-----8/10
","Saw crept up on us like Jigsaw creeps on his victim. Completely out of nowhere but not easily forgotten. The movie starts of in a large bathroom where two men are chained up and a dead man is lying between them. They don't who each other is or how they got there. The script by Leigh Whannell (who also plays one of the captives) is ingeniously clever and very twisted especially when showing different victims in various booby traps and deadly. My favorite is the guy that is locked in a room with numbers all over the wall. A taped message tells him there is poison in his veins and that the antidote is locked in a safe in the room. The combo to the safe is hidden in the numbers on the wall. However, the room is dark and he has to use a candle, but his body is smeared with a flammable goop. Oh and there is broken glass shards on the floor. Now only a truly sick individual can come up with something like that. The movie really isn't as gory as many people believe, but it wouldn't make a difference in a movie that actually relies on mystery rather than horror. The whole movie is really solid, but the part that makes the movie a highly rewatchable classic is the brilliant ending. I promise you will be shocked at the ending. Even after the third viewing it had my heart pounding through my chest. This movie also kicked off an interest in me for independent films. They seem to be made with more TLC than most Hollywood stuff, but of course since this movie made big bucks at the box office it is turning into a franchise with two sequels in two years. Neither will be as entertaining as the original and not too many movies have the ability to make you watch it over and over. Bravo! 8/10",8,0,2,9 May 2006
The Last Samurai," Great Samurai Movie--- 8/10
","I am probably gonna have dreams of being in Japan's beautiful countryside, practicing sword skills and drinking sake after watching this movie. It is a very interesting film, not only because of it's incredible battle scenes, but it's look into old Japanese culture and it's focus on the violent civil war between a modernizing government and rebellious samurai. I don't know too much about that time, but the writers didn't seem to put anything in the movie that was historically inaccurate or too 'Hollywood'. The cast did an amazing job as well. Tom Cruise gives the best performance i have seen him in, but in my opinion, Ken Watanabe steals the show. He is the lead samurai who takes Algren (Cruise) prisoner in a samurai village. I think he deserves the Best Supporting Oscar, or, at the very least, a nomination. Koyuki is a beautiful woman who hosts Algren in her home at the asking of Wanatabe. She brings a peace and beauty to a place that is ravaged by war. The pace sags here and there, but the action and performances more then make up for it. 8/10",8,1,2,7 December 2003
Pulp Fiction," One of my favorite movies---9/10
","Three stories are intertwined into one in the Quentin Tarantino masterpiece Pulp Fiction. Tarantino is master of dialogue and one of the best things about this movie is the conversations between the characters. They are like a plot all by themselves. You have no idea what's going to said next. Sometimes it shocking and it's very often funny. The all-star cast consisting of John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, and Uma Thurman deliver their instantly classic lines with perfection. Pulp Fiction also has exciting scenes and a great story. Travolta and Jackson play two hit men working for a crime lord (Ving Rhames). Bruce Willis plays a boxer on the run and Thurman plays Rhames' wife. Violence, betrayal, drugs, and comedy ensue in movie that's plot on paper doesn't sound like much, but with a great cast and an excellent filmmaker in Tarantino, it is easily one of the best movies of all time. 9/10",9,0,1,29 December 2003
The Untouchables," Great but a little flawed---7/10
","This was a really good movie to watch when you are into mafia movies, because it is very authentic looking. However, when i watch this movie, i can't shake the feeling that it resembles an action movie more than a historical drama. I have no problem with that except that it takes away from the accuracy of the film. For example, Frank Nitti was never thrown off a roof by Elliot Ness. He actually committed suicide near some railroad tracks. That sounds a lot more dramatic than being thrown off a roof. But as an action movie, i guess it was more exciting.Robert De Niro and Sean Connery do great as Al Capone and Malone, respectively. De Niro resembles Al Capone and even put on extra weight to better fit the role. Connery is hilarious and bad-ass as Malone, the cop who helps Elliot Ness fight Capone. This movie is worth owning for the cool shootouts and great acting. 7/10",7,1,2,2 August 2003
The Godfather: Part III," Very underrated
","Sure it's not better than the first two, but it still beats a lot of the crap out there now. Al Pacino is great in this movie and Andy Garcia's character Vincent is a refreshing addition. Lots of violence and emotion are packed into this movie that should have been more recognized than it was. My only complaint was Sofia Coppola's sometimes wooden acting, but she did OK. I would recommend it to anyone who loved the first two.",7,0,1,3 August 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," A Great Sequel---8/10
","The Matrix Reloaded fails to be as good as it's predecessor, but it is still a great movie. There is some amazing action sequences (which is really the point of the Matrix movies), including the highway chase which punches you in the face with sheer energy and excitement. The so-called Burly Brawl is really cool as well, in which hundreds of Agent Smiths take on a single Neo. Speaking of Agent Smith, Hugo Weaving makes a character almost as cool as Darth Vader.The film has it's fair share of flaws, though. Zion is not a very exciting place, for instance. Nothing really happens there, except for an overlong party, full of slo-mo dancing, and a cheesy speech by Morpheus. I was just waiting for him to yell 'Can you dig it?'. Aside from that, the story writers tried to cram the story lines into conversations that would take a computer technician and a thesaurus to try and understand.Still, The Matrix Reloaded is a great sequel to one of the best sci-fi films ever. It's no Empire Strikes Back, but it is definitely worth the watch for the action sequences, Monica Bellucci, and, of course, Agent Smith. 8/10",8,0,1,14 December 2004
Mystic River," Excellent mix of mystery and drama---8/10
","Mystic River is an incredibly acted and directed movie. Sean Penn gives an outstanding performance as a grieving father who's daughter was savagely murdered and Tim Robbins is superb as a man who suffered a horrible experience as a child. Kevin Bacon also gives a strong performance as a detective who has to solve this emotional case. All three were friends in childhood but grew apart after Robbins' character's experience. Clint Eastwood does an excellent job blending a powerful drama with a intricate murder mystery. It is a movie about murder, revenge, abuse, karma, and sin, and is one of the best films of 2003. 8/10",8,0,0,9 November 2003
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," A funny and action-packed good time----8/10
","Mr. and Mrs. Smith is a refreshing alternative to to the kiddie CG flicks and stale comedies that have filled the multiplexes recently (and the only other movie i wanted to see this summer besides Star Wars). It's a classic action-comedy that pits two big stars against each other and about a thousand baddies, bickering all the while. Though usually action-comedy means cops, Smith adds a twist and makes it a pair of married assassins, played by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. The chemistry between the two stars is why Smith is so entertaining. Not only do they look good, but they seem to know the married life well, and deliver their sharp lines with hilarious punch. If you don't acknowledge the existence of idiotic tabloids, you will enjoy this chemistry a lot more.The actions scenes are good for being PG-13, (though an R rating would have given us some gratuitous Jolie skin shots) and with this kind of movie you don't really need blood, though it wouldn't hurt. The fight in the Smith house is my favorite scene because it is funny and has them beating the crap out of each other. Same with the freeway chase. While the movie is a lot of fun, the plot is paper thin and predictable (mostly because of the film's trailer) and ends kind of abruptly. Still, this is what an action comedy should be like; plenty of bullets, great chemistry between the stars, and hilarious dialogue. Mr. and Mrs. Smith is one of the best movies of the year.---8/10",8,2,5,27 June 2005
The Departed," Scorsese returns to the house he built--- 8/10
","A few years back i was worrying about the state of the gangster movie. There were tries. Some people did an okay job, some made laughable attempts to emulate classics like the Goodfellas and Scarface. I started to think that with the Sopranos knocking all mafia-esquire stories out of the park, the classic gangster movie may be dead.Now, the man that helmed some of the greatest gangster movies of all time, Martin Scorsese, returns and adds a cop movie twist. The Departed is loosely based on the Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs, which was a decent thriller with great performances. The Departed however is a great thriller, with amazing performances, all directed by a master of the medium.The Departed follows two moles; one a cop in the Irish mob, and the other an Irish mobster with cops. Both answer to Frank Costello and Oliver Queenan, the mob boss and the head state trooper, respectively. As each find out about each other, they enter a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse as they race along the body littered streets to blow each others covers. Now, i know it sounded like the back cover of the latest Wesley Snipes movie, but The Departed is a gripping, exciting, and star-studded epic.The most instantly appealing part of the film is the amazing ensemble cast that includes Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nichcolson, Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, and Martin Sheen. They all do an amazing job but never though i would say this; I officially forgive Dicaprio for his crimes against cinema. While Jack steals the show of course, Leo turns in an incredible performance, becoming the character you actually care about the most. His intentions are well, but the act of betrayal is wrong and has consequences no matter what, and thats what Leo brought to the table. Matt Damon handles his rare bad guy role really well, and Jack Nicholson rivals Joe Pesci in Goodfellas for being both hilarious and terrifying.Martin Scorsese knows how to use his cast to tell the story in the best way possible. This story, at it's core a straight-forward thriller plot, could have been handled by any director and made a good movie that you would forget in a few hours. Scorsese, however, puts the characters first, haunts you with their mentalities and their ultimate fates, and creates an unforgettable film. Welcome back, Marty. 8/10",8,0,0,7 October 2006
Die Hard," A true action classic!----9/10
","Ah the late 80's. A time when action movies were made by stunt men and dynamite, instead of computers and green-screen. Also, a time where action movies were of much higher quality. You had your Lethal Weapon, your Terminator, and of course your Die Hard.Bruce Willis solidified his place in movie history by filming an entire action film barefoot. His performance as John McClane is hilarious and exciting. This man started the one-liners that became a cliché for action heroes later on. And he did all of his own stunts which includes the now classic jumping off an exploding skyscraper while tied to a firehose.Alan Rickman also stars as Hans Gruber, a diabolical thief disguised as a terrorist, creating one of the best villains of all time. He and Willis have a great chemistry on screen, another reason this movies is so damn good. The action is also more realistic then other movies. McClane sneaks around and ambushes the baddies, (sort of like Rambo in a building) instead of running with guns blazing, in which case he would have been blown away in the first reel.Die Hard is one of th best action movies of all time due to it's explosive action, great acting, cool location, and exciting story. Oh, yeah. And no CGI! 9/10",9,1,1,16 December 2004
War of the Worlds," A great thrill-ride from start to about 20 minutes before the finish---8/10
","Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds is a classic alien invasion flick. Not too much time is wasted before the aliens invade and start zapping humans into dust and flipping cars over. Tom Cruise plays Ray, a regular guy with regular family problems who is trying to get his son and daughter the hell out of dodge. Now that we got the story out of the way, let's get to the goods. The alien tripods are huge and terrifying, with superlasers and tubes that suck blood, a far cry from E.T.'s bicycle and Reeces Pieces. Spielberg's cinematography is amazing once again, from wide shots of the aliens destroying cities to a river of corpses. This is his most gorgeous film since Minority Report (while A.I. was also pretty to look at, it was painfully boring and confusing). The non-stop thrills includes an alien attack on a boat of refugees, the family hiding in a basement from a huge alien eyeball, and Cruise actually being swallowed by one of the tripods. The pace is lightning quick, Cruise is as good as ever, Fanning is proving to be better than most adult actresses, and the action is non-stop. A really great movie...And then comes the ending. The standard Hollywood cop-out, spic and span ending. Not only does the film include one of the weakest and anti-climactic ways to defeat an invading alien force (Can't the aliens just destroy us for once) but all the main characters live, even after making you think one of them is dead in an emotionally powerful scene. This almost ruins the movie, but the rest of it is so good, i can forgive. Maybe.However, this is still a blockbuster alien invasion epic with amazing special effects (ILM strikes again) and great performances. This is a must-see in theaters. The price is worth it for enhanced picture and sound. Enjoy the ride.---8/10",8,2,5,1 July 2005
Man on Fire," Excellent action/drama---8/10
","Man on Fire takes the standard revenge story to a whole new level. Denzel Washington stars as Creasy, an alcoholic ex-marine who is hired to protect a young American girl (Dakota Fanning) in Mexico City during a wave of kidnappings. Denzel and Dakota have an amazing chemistry on-screen, making her character's kidnapping and Creasy's ensuing killing spree much more effective. Washington is again Oscar-worthy in a performance which is as good if not better than that in Training Day. Fanning is charming as usual and you become attached to her as Creasy did. The great cast also includes Christopher Walken (who is especially good in this movie), Rachel Ticotin, Giancarlo Giannini, and Radha Mitchell,(who also turns in a really good performance, not to mention hot.)The movie is directed by Tony Scott, who has directed some of my favorite action movies, such as Enemy of the State and The Last Boy Scout. He does a great job here as well, with some great shots and a clever way to put in subtitles. However, some of the quick cutaways and camera movements do get a little annoying, but it is a minor drawback. The only other flaws, which are little bigger, were that it could be a little predictable at times and the ending could have been better. By better i mean letting Creasy live! I hate when they make you love somebody whether hero or villain, just to have them killed. That really doesn't take away much though, because it could also be really unpredictable and the ending is powerful, but i am sure everyone would have liked to have a more Hollywood ending to this one. Usually, i don't like Hollywood endings, but i really wanted Creasy to live. Damn reality!All in all, Man on Fire is one the best movies of the year and is packed with action, drama and great performances. This should win some Oscars but the Academy sucks so it won't. 8/10",8,0,0,13 October 2004
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," A few funny moments, but mostly just stupid---4/10
","Will Ferrell is called by many as the funniest man on the planet. No. That title can go to either Chris Tucker or Jim Carrey. He can work a few chuckles out of me here and there, but for the most part he is nothing special. I know that is a sin to a lot of people, but it's just my opinion. Anchorman is an example of how funny and unfunny he can be. The funniest parts were honestly the bloopers during the end credits, where i laughed a lot more than the entire movie.The movie itself is a series of either mildly funny or just stupid scenes. The cologne scene is funny, but the fight between all the news crews were stupid. The two lead anchors exchanging insults during the credits of their news program is funny, but the ending at the zoo was really stupid. I guess humor is in the eye of the beholder. 4/10",4,0,1,5 March 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Definitely the best of the prequels, and one of the best in years----9/10
","The greatest saga in history comes full circle with Revenge of the Sith, the third prequel to Star Wars. After the breakout of the Clone Wars in Episode II, Anakin and Obi-Wan are defending the Republic from the Seperatists, Padme is pregnant with Anakin's children, and Senator Palpatine is hatching a plan to become ruler of the galaxy. Oh, and did i mention Vader is born?Revenge of the Sith is the darkest Star Wars movie, beating Empire Strikes Back by a mile. It is violent, disturbing, and depressing, and that makes it one of the best Star Wars stories, period. Anakin's transformation into Vader is amazing and tragic, with Hayden Christensen turning in an excellent performance, especially towards the end, after being corrupted by Palpatine. The silly moments from the first two prequels are gone and Jar Jar thankfully doesn't say a word.Ian McDiarmid is perfect once again as the most evil man in the universe, Emperor Palpatine. He delivers his cool lines ('Join me and you will achieve a power greater than any Jedi.') like he was born in the Star Wars universe. Ewan McGregor is also great as Obi-Wan, really showing off his acting and athletic chops, with countless lightsaber fights and action scenes, and an emotional finale with Anakin.Speaking of lightsaber fights, there are about a dozen in the movie with Yoda kicking major ass throughout, and a cool new villain General Grievous wielding four lightsabers. The battle scenes weren't as good as Hoth or Geonosis, but the clone troopers looked cool, (gotta love that camouflage) and it was cool seeing the Wookiees again if only briefly.With this being the last Star Wars film, it was bittersweet walking out of the theater. The movie was awesome but it sucks to realize there are no more coming. I saw a midnight show, but there were no yawns. Applause erupted very often, and seeing Vader on the big screen again was amazing. This was the best theater experience in my life. Thanks George Lucas for making Star Wars.---9/10",9,2,5,20 May 2005
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," An amazing war movie---9/10
","South Korea puts Saving Private Ryan to shame with this amazing war movie. Taegukgi (or Brotherhood of War) is probably the best traditional war movie i have ever seen. The battle scenes are intense and brutal, even more so then Spielberg's classic film (which is a movie i really like, too.) They also kick in at unexpected places. They are sitting around eating and suddenly bombs are exploding and limbs are flying. The acting is incredible and emotional even though i watched it in subtitles (dubbed English voices are horrible). The facial expressions said it all. The story is a heartbreaking tale of two brothers who are drafted into the Korean conflict in 1950. By the end, i came this close to tearing up. And i am a tough guy. Or so i think.Now i know a lot of people in America tend to overlook foreign movies because their afraid of reading, or can't read, but i am finding more and more that foreign flicks are a lot better than recent Hollywood movies. Hollywood needs to take a lesson and make more creative stories.This is truly a masterpiece of modern cinema, a milestone in war movies, and one of the best films i have seen in a long time. Incredible.---9/10",9,7,8,7 May 2005
Vanilla Sky," Strange but very good 7/10
","Once in a while, i see a movie that slowly sneaks by brain out of my head, proceeds to kick, punch and elbow drop it for a couple of hours and the put it back in, upside down and inside it. Memento did it. The Matrix did it. And now Vanilla Sky has done it.I used to not like Tom Cruise very much. He was always the pretty boy hero type that never interested me. But the last four movies i have seen featuring him have really change my mind, including Collateral (his best work), A Few Good Men (i know it's old but i just saw it recently), The Last Samurai, and Vanilla Sky. He really has become one of the best actors today.As for the movie itself, it is filled with thrills, sex, comedy, twists, and uhh sex. Speaking of sex, it also features two extremely hot women with great supporting roles in Cameron Diaz and Penelople Cruz. The ending really made the whole film click. Some parts of the movie were a bit confusing and the beginning is a little slow, but as a whole the movie is really worth a look. 7/10",7,0,1,9 January 2005
Bruce Almighty," Best Carrey flick since Liar, Liar---7/10
","Although i liked Liar, Liar a little more than Bruce Almighty, that doesn't make this a bad film. It is a hilarious comedy starring one of the funniest men alive. Jim Carrey stars as Bruce, a down on his luck news reporter who begins to blame God for all his misfortune. Then God contacts him and gives Bruce his powers to show him how hard being the master of the universe is. Jim Carrey is laugh out loud funny in this movie. His mix of physical comedy and comedic dialogue is great. Some of the funniest parts in the movie are scenes of him ranting about about how God ignores him or snapping on live television and insulting everyone. Morgan Freeman plays the man upstairs and Jennifer Aniston plays Bruce's girlfriend. They both have some funny moments, but Carrey steals the show as always. 7/10",7,0,1,1 June 2003
Casino Royale," A great rebirth of 007-------8/10
","'What? A blond guy playing James Bond? Time to riot!' This was the sort of sentiment that was commonplace when Daniel Craig was announced as the next generation James Bond. At the time i didn't think he fit the mold for 007, either. I must say i stand corrected and glad about it. He did a great job because of one thing: I believed him as James Bond. Now they could have gotten any white, black haired actor with an English accent to play Bond and he may or may not have worked out. But Craig made you believe he was Bond. Thats really all i wanted. Now bring on the action!The backbone of any great 007 movie is the action sequences. Even the action from the Connery days still hold up well (check out the underwater battle in Thunderball). Casino Royale is no exception. It's got an explosive chase at Miami Airport and great fight scenes in Monte Carlo and pretty much everywhere Bond goes. But the standout scene is a heart-stopping on-foot chase between Bond and a bomb maker played by free runner Sebastien Foucan, who puts on one of the most agile and athletic action performances since Ray Park in The Phantom Menace. He bounces off walls and jumps from huge cranes and always lands on his feet. This is one of the coolest action scenes ever. Period. And also watch for the most cringe-worthy torture scene i have ever seen. There's no gore or anything but you will feel this man's pain.Another staple of Bond flicks are the beautiful women. This on has more than enough with Eva Green's excellent performance as Bond's match Vesper Lynd, and the stunning Caterina Murino as the obligatory bad guy's wife, Solange. And of course Bond gets to bed them both.Now as much I enjoyed Casino Royale, it did have a few setbacks. The bad guy, Le Chiffre (played perfectly by Mads Mikkelsen), is a great villain but i thought his exit was sudden and unsatisfactory. And after that, the movie doesn't really have a climax. The whole third act actually suffers from not having a definitive bad guy and gets a bit predictable. However, a lot of people complained that the poker scenes take too much time. I found them to be exciting, fun, and very well done.At any rate, i am glad to say that Casino Royale is a great rebirth of 007. He is the classic Bond, but a little rough around the edges, more ruthless, and more vulnerable, which i think will make for a great new series of 007 films. Welcome back, Mr. Bond. 8/10",8,2,4,23 November 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Pretty Good Ending---6/10
","Some of the more devoted and insane people will claim this movie perfect and what-not, but it is pretty good. Return of the King concludes the trilogy in a battle-packed finish. When i heard the movie was 3 and a half hours long, i was skeptical that i could keep my interest, but the pacing is done well for the most of the three hours and then crawls for the final 30 minutes. It just didn't know when to end. I never read the books, but i'm sure you can't cram every detail into a feature-length film. Other than that and the fact it tried to be too emotional, it delivered exactly what it should: an entertaining conclusion. The battle scenes were fast and furious and there were some very suspenseful moments. However, it is really nothing more than a good trilogy. Some people are taking it way too far. But that's just my opinion. 6/10",3,0,2,18 December 2003
Munich," Bold and worth watching, but significant flaws keep it from masterpiece status---6/10
","Munich takes a bold look at the MidEast conflict by examining the 1972 Munich massacre and it's aftermath. Steven Spielberg, widely revered in both Hollywood and the Jewish community, puts his neck out by (finally) criticizing Israel and it's politics, if just a little. Israel would make you think it's an anti-semitic film, but in actuality it is a fair look at the pros and cons of both political views. Eric Bana and Daniel Craig lead a Israeli assassin squad ordered to hunt down and kill all those responsible for the killing of 11 Israeli athletes. While the movie has some really exciting scenes and tries to be fair, it is way too long and sometimes seems lost, like it doesn't know which direction it wants to go next. Spielberg could have easily trimmed a half hour of fat off the film. There were some really good scenes in the movie, but they were few and far between. I commend Spielberg for taking risks and giving Palestinians a few moments in the movie to speak; i just wish he packed up all the good stuff in a tighter package. 6/10",6,1,4,8 May 2006
The Matrix," The Best Sci-Fi movie of the 90's---8/10
","The Matrix is one of the very best science fiction films of all time. Like George Lucas did with Star Wars, Andy and Larry Wachowski create a fascinating world with a different history. Everybody thinks the year is 1999. But in the real world it is closer to 2099 and the world is a very different place. Our reliance on machines has backfired and they have taken over, harvesting humans and connecting them to a system called the matrix, where humans live and think like it is modern day. The story follows of a group of rebels who escaped the matrix who find who they think is their savior, Neo (Keanu Reeves). What follows is an action-packed thrill ride, with an excellent story, and a perfect performance by Hugo Weaving, who plays Agent Smith, a computer program assigned to stop any human resistance.The action scenes completely blow you away. With old-school wire fu, they create a classic sparring session between Neo and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). And with extraordinary special effects, they crafted one of the best action sequences ever made in the lobby shootout. Tons of bullets, bodies, and shattered walls fill the screen while a great soundtrack blasts across the room. It has to be seen.While the two sequels were very good, they didn't come close to living up to the first installment, that has set a new standard for science-fiction that will take a heck of a lot to reach. 8/10",8,2,4,12 December 2004
Casino," An excellent gangster film!---9/10
","After seeing this and Goodfellas i have come to a theory: All movies should star Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. These two geniuses can turn any movie into a masterpiece. They can make you laugh and cry pretty much at the same time. The film follows Ace Rothstien (De Niro) when he gets the biggest prize a gambler can get: his own casino. Of course he has to pay the mobsters who gave it to them. He also has to deal with the violent and costly exploits of his friend Nicky (Pesci). Joe Pesci again perfects the loud mouth loose cannon character as he did in Goodfellas, but i think here he was given a more important part. Robert De Niro can not fail. You can see the stress and anger in his eyes in this film. Martin Scorsese is the world's greatest director. Screw the Academy. He should have won the best director Oscar several times by now. I would love to see him do more work with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. This is a classic gangster picture that is always compared to Goodfellas. I think they are two different stories and two excellent films. 9/10",9,1,2,7 December 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Where It All Began-----10/10
","I can never pick a favorite movie because different movies have different effects. Goodfellas is my favorite drama. Face/Off is my favorite actioner. But when it comes to pure amazement, nothing beats Star Wars. We are introduced to a whole other universe with different creatures, different lifestyles, and different history. We are dropped in the middle of an intergalactic war between an empire and a rebellion that has raged for years and left the universe in ruin. It was the most fascinating thing to see when i was eleven, but to this day i am still a Star Wars nerd.The cast of characters includes some of the coolest, funniest, and most tragic in film, and the actors who play them fit seamlessly into this new universe. Alec Guiness is flawless as Obi-Wan Kenobi, a Jedi on the run from the evil Empire. Harrison Ford is awesome as Han Solo, a smuggler and thief who helps the gang rescue the princess. But the my favorite character of all time is Darth Vader. Not only is he the coolest bad guy, but we learn in later films why he is evil and start to feel sympathetic for him. Not to mention that badass booming voice that can make ordering a pizza sound threatening.This was not only the beginning of the best movie series ever, but it was the beginning of my love for movies. George Lucas is a genius for being able to come up with a great story and an incredible backdrop for what was supposed to be a flop, but turned into one of the best films ever. 10/10",10,295,390,22 October 2003
Fantastic Four," A light and entertaining comic book flick--- 7/10
","Fantastic Four is a perfect example of a what a PG-13 comic book movie based on a story that was meant to be fun and light-hearted should be. I caught this in theaters and i swear i had a great time. It's funny, has a great action sequence on the bridge, and a pretty decent villain. This is not a masterpiece, nor did it intend to be. It's good old fashioned fun at the movies. Remember those days?Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) steals the show with his clever one-liners and fire 'everywhere'. Especially funny when cracking on my other favorite Ben Grimm (Micheal Chiklis). Kudos to Chiklis for fighting to make the Thing in costume and make up instead of CGI. It paid off because the costume looks great and computer graphics would have crapified the whole flick. Just like they did with Mr. Fantastic's stretching ability which looks pretty damn horrible. Jessica Alba, on the other hand, is still smokin' hot. She was okay in the movie too.This is an underrated movie that is lots of fun to watch, so if you don't feel like getting confused, depressed, or bored, this is a fine alternative.--- 7/10",7,1,3,24 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Best in the Series----10/10
","This is the best film in the Star Wars series because it is where the most important things happen. Darth Vader tells Luke he's his daddy, Han Solo is frozen in cryptanite, we are introduced to Yoda, and more is learned about Jedi. I think George Lucas put this trilogy out first because the twists are too good to already know they are coming. He does such a good job putting all this on the screen, i can't believe he didn't win Best Director, and it's even more shocking that neither this nor it's predecessor won Best Picture. What was the Academy thinking? Anyway, most of the cast returns and the special effects, while now severely outdated, are good for it's time. The Special Edition has to be the best thing to ever come to Star Wars fans (until the highly anticipated DVDs). The sfx are redone and the picture quality is enhanced. The Battle on Hoth and the escape from Cloud City are two of the best scenes ever filmed. Empire Strikes Back is the best in the series and one the best films of all time. 10/10",10,0,1,22 October 2003
Sin City," Badass heroes and stunning visuals make Sin City a blast!----8/10
","A film i have been anticipating for over a year, Sin City is a Pulp Fiction- like story featuring three different plots, derived from the graphic novels by Frank Miller, who served as co-director. All the stories take place in Basin City, a town of hookers and criminals and even more criminal police and politicians. I had never even heard of the novels before i had heard of the movie. But after reading about it, it is definitely my kind of comic. And even more so, my kind of movie. The dialouge is smart and hilarious (although occasionally cheesy), the violence is gratuitous but in a good way, and the look of the movie is phenomenal. It is also one of the most exciting movies in years, establishing the characters quickly, and putting them in peril every other minute. You really have no idea of what could happen next. Something that adds to the thrills is that sometimes the characters live and sometimes they die, including the major ones.Speaking of the characters, the enormous cast of A-list stars bring them convincingly to life. Mickey Rourke (who kicks a metric ton of ass as Marv), Bruce Willis and Clive Owen are excellent, and the film bursts at the scenes with hotties showing their acting chops among other assets (wink-wink) including Jessica Alba, Carla Gugino, Brittany Murphy, Jaime King, Rosario Dawson, and Alexis Bledel. This is the absolute best cast since Goodfellas. While some of them overact (Brittany Murphy) and some underact (Micheal Madsen), it doesn't take much away from the movie, especially since this is one of the best looking movies ever. The stark black and white and frequent splashes of vivid color make for some serious eye-candy, almost equaling that of Gugino's and King's gorgeous birthday suits. Plus, Jessica Alba dances on a pole. I mean come on.Sin City is the first movie i have seen this year, because basically everything else looks like crap. But it is a refreshing reminder that there are filmmakers like Robert Rodriguez out there who make original and unpredictable movies that come out of nowhere to smack us in the face. Fantastic job guys.---8/10",8,0,0,6 April 2005
Gangs of New York," Another Great Film for Scorsese---7/10
","A lot of people think this is Scorsese's worst film. Even though that can't be taken as a bad thing since most of his movies are masterpieces, i think this is one of his best. Other than some minor flaws such as the love story and the good but not great ending, this is another great film for an already master director. Most parts of the story can easily be turned into a modern gangster film. It is a movie filled with crime, revenge, and betrayal. Daniel-Day Lewis gives the true greatest performance of the year and one of the best i have seen ever. This is the first Leonardo DiCaprio movie i liked. Titanic sucked and we all know it. Cameron Diaz is delicious in any era and although i didn't like the love story i did like her character. Goodfellas remains my favorite Scorsese, but this is a great movie with a excellent acting and one of the best of 2002. The academy should be ashamed. 7/10",7,0,0,12 July 2003
True Romance," Truly Great Movie----8/10
","This movie proves that Quentin Tarantino knows how to write cool movies. There is a lot of violence but you actually care about the characters. You hope and pray through every shootout that they will get out alive. The story follows a an average joe in Detroit who falls for pretty girl named Alabama. After he rescues her from her pimp, they go on the run. Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken all kick major ass in this movie directed by another great director, Tony Scott. This is a movie for everyone because it mixes action, suspense, romance, and drama all in one little package. And that is why Quentin Tarantino rules. 8/10",8,0,1,11 August 2003
Goodfellas," One of the best films ever----10/10
","I once read a story about Martin Scorsese's battle with cocaine addiction and how Robert De Niro saved his life one way or another by visiting him in the hospital and convincing him to get back to work and make Raging Bull. I started to think that if it wasn't for that, we may never have seen Goodfellas. So if the above is true, thank you Bobby and Marty for making it possible.Goodfellas is one of the very best movies i have ever seen. It's story, it's dialouge, it's visual style, and it's characters force us to sit up and pay attention to the story of a guy who as far back as he could remember always wanted to be a gangster. In what should have been an Oscar-winning performance (more on that later), Ray Liotta delivers as Henry Hill, a half-Irish half-Italian New Yorker who joins the local mob and is introduced to a life most people never have the chance to live. He meets a pretty but fiery woman named Karen (Lorraine Bracco), makes best friends Jimmy (Robert De Niro) and Tommy (Joe Pesci), and becomes a mob saint when he helps pull off a multi-million dollar heist. Slowly but surely, however, the good life turns sour as he cheats on his wife, the heist eventually costs him everything he has and some very dear friends, and he is forced to testify against the people who gave him so much and enter witness protection.Martin Scorsese moves the story along with quick pace, by using hilarious, violent, and emotional scenes alternately. We see Hill's life deteriorate by keeping the glamour and the women at the beginning and the addictions and paranoia towards the end. It is an absolute shame that this film didn't win Best Director (which Scorsese should have one countless times by now), let alone Best Picture, Actor, Supporting Actress, and Adapted Screenplay. This is the reason i don't care for the Oscars anymore. One thing the Academy did do right is give Joe Pesci the Best Supporting Actor award. Never has a character been so funny and so terrifying all in the same film. Pesci was another reason the 2 and a half hour film goes by in a snap.Goodfellas, in my opinion, is even better than the Godfather. While the Godfather may have Marlon Brando's brilliant performance and more visually pleasing locations, Goodfellas is a true gangster picture based on reality and more adaptable to modern times. It is not only a classic, it is a masterpiece. 10/10",10,0,1,29 July 2003
V for Vendetta," V is an A+!-------8/10
","V for Vendetta is the first film in 2006 that i will fondly remember by 2007. It is a thought-provoking and action packed vision of a totalitarian future Britain, but it could easily be any other country. The story is different and exciting, the action is violent and not watered down like most action flicks of late, and the performances by the excellent cast is great. Hugo Weaving takes the cake, even though he is behind a mask the whole time, with his cool voice and ass-kickery, and Natalie Portman is amazing. She is one of the best actresses in the world today, and she proves it by being tough and beautiful (even after having her head shaved) and hitting all the right emotional notes right on target. The last 30 minutes of the film is one of the most exhilarating scenes i've ever seen in a movie theater. At the movie's climax i was nearly standing. The visuals and sound are top notch and boost the overall experience. If you can, see this movie in theaters for one of the best rides in a long time! 8/10",9,0,1,7 May 2006
The Island," An entertaining sci-fi actioner, but could have been really great---7/10
","I don't care what people think of Micheal Bay. When it comes to action movies, he has made some of the very best including the Rock and Bad Boys. Sure Pearl Harbor was weak (except for the actual Pearl Harbor scene, which takes only 30% of the movie), but nobody's perfect. With the Island, i was expecting something along the lines of Minority Report meets the Rock. A movie that would blow me away with jaw-dropping action, amazing special effects and a cool story. Well, it didn't turn out just like that. Don't get me wrong, i enjoyed the movie, but not as much as i would have liked.For one, the story didn't do much for me. It seems like the story was merely an excuse for special effects and action, instead of being part of the movie. Now, i love action, and the high speed chase in the movie was pretty damn good. But for me to really get into the action, i have to be drawn in by a good story. Also, the quick camera cuts weren't very pretty, and i am actually getting sick of every movie using them. Whatever happened to still camera?Now that i got the cons out of the way, i can tell you what i liked about the movie. The underground facility at the beginning was cool, and a great intro for the movie. The whole lottery spin idea was also cool, but would have been more exciting if commercials hadn't ruined the outcome for us. Damn marketers! The performances by Ewan McGregor (quickly becoming one of my favorite actors. Go Obi!) and Scarlett Johansson (mmm...Scarlett Johansson) were very good, throwing in some class and humanity in a sort of movie where there is usually neither. And did i mention the chase scene? One of the better action scenes of the year, very intense and imaginative.While this is no Matrix, the Island is a pretty entertaining summer blockbuster that has enough action, pretty faces, and eye-candy to fill your sci-fi needs until they make Equilibrium 2.---7/10",7,0,0,30 July 2005
The Godfather," Simply Excellent----9/10
","It is no wonder The Godafather is often regarded as the best film ever. It was totally original at it's time and today, it is filled with great performances that set up wonderful careers, and it is overflowing with drama, romance, mystery, intrigue, action, and tragedy. This epic follows the Corleone family's trials and tribulations in New York and Italy. Vito is the don, Michael, Fredo, and Sonny are his three sons and Tom is his consigliere. This is my favorite of the GF movies. My favorite character is Sonny played by James Caan. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and the late John Cazale are all excellent. In my opinion Goodfellas is the best mob movie ever, but this pulls in an ultra close second. 9/10",9,1,3,3 August 2003
