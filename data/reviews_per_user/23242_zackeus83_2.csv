Angels & Demons," If you read the book, prepare to be disappointed
","Of the people I saw Angels & Demons with, only 2 of us had read the book. And everyone besides the 2 of us liked the movie. I think we would've liked it as well had we not come in with such high expectations from an amazing novel.The problem is how far they stray from the novel for seemingly pointless reasons. The character of Maximillian Kohler (director of CERN and suspect in the bomb threat) is completely absent from the movie. The real villain's reason for the attack has been altered so much that it doesn't even question the same issues of the religion as intended in the story. And what on Earth was the point of changing the final Illuminati symbol?! One of the most fascinating parts of the book was the artistry of these designs, and they left out the most incredible one. There are also dozens more differences that will irritate any fan of the book.If you've read the book, just watch it on DVD if at all. If you haven't read it, go see it and my guess is you'll love it. I'm sure I would have. I think from now on, I'll read the book after the movie to avoid disappointment, because the books always seem to be better. But hey, at least Tom Hanks got rid of that weird wannabe mullet from the first film.",4,1,4,18 May 2009
Hostel," hostel = the goodness
","'Hostel' is by no means an Academy Award winner, but it is exactly what Eli Roth intended it to be - a good, solid creepy movie (a definite step up from the letdown known as 'Cabin Fever' which was still pretty funny). Yes, it is just another movie for young men all about sex and ultra-violence. Yes it's pretty low-budget. And it's definitely not for the faint of heart. But if you're looking for a good gross-out with plenty of unnecessary sex, then this movie is perfect for you.Paxton and Josh are American friends traveling Europe in search of a good, preferably illegal, time. They partner up with a random Icelandic man and hit clubs and brothels to have the trip of a lifetime. But when they hear about the beautiful girls of Slovakia, they decide to change their itinerary. And one by one, people come up missing at their new hostel, and no one is quite who they appear to be. With a pretty crazy plot twist, eerie performances from some new actors, and gut-wrenching effects, 'Hostel' is sure to become a classic horror film.",8,2,2,1 August 2006
