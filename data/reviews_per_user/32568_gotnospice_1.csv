Requiem for a Dream," Vivid Reality of life
","This movie was amazingly real.  It is about the life and life style ofdrug addicts.  It isn't just about everyday druggies but it depictshow doctors and they medicines they prescribe aren't alwaysgood.  If not used properly they can cause disastrous results.The camera work and editing are amazing too.  There is excellentuse of the split screen to connect two images with out doingsimple cuts.This movie is very vivid and straight up when it comes to drugs andnot only what they do to your body but also your life, and otherslives.They only problems I found with the movie is in incorrectlydepicting the medical field.  Or at least only depicting the smallsection of bad medicine that's out there.  A doctor would never callthe police if they found out that a person seeking treatment was adrug user.  Doctors swear to give treatment to all in need, while athe same time keeping anything you tell or show them confidential. I didn't like this because it might make someone watching thevideo think that if they ever needed help they would not seek it,because they are afraid they would get told on.  Doctors also don'tuse electroshock therapy anymore or use saws to cut arms off.Other than that this movie is a must see.  It depicts what is realand does it in an excellent way.",10,0,1,17 August 2001
