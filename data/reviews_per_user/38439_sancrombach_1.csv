Requiem for a Dream," One of my favorite movies of all time!
","I'm very interested in movies, not only to watch but also to make them. For my school I'm gonna make my third little movie in the next couple of weeks so I'm always interested in how movies are filmed. And I must say that requiem for a dream is one of the best made films I've seen till now, and I've seen a lot of movies... It's just a genius play that doesn't only show people who get more addictive, but also let you experience how they are feeling and in to it! Genius I tell you. I hope I can ever make a movie like that!",10,0,0,9 September 2001
