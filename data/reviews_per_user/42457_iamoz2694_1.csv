The Devil's Advocate," Al Pacino's hands
","I loved this movie an have watched it dozens of times. Has anyone noticed that any closeups of Al Pacino's hands show at least one funky thumbnail...like he has a fungus or something? When he puts his finger in the water bowl in the church you can get the best glimpse of it, and most other times, he tucks his fingers in as he's using his hands to 'talk' (so typically Italian). There are a couple of other times when you can see it for a second or two. So what if the guy has some ugly hands and some huge teeth that sometimes get in the way of his dialogue. Anyway, I just have nothing better to do than see goofy things like this.",10,1,2,29 July 2008
