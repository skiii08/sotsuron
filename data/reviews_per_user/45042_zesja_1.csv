Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT
","I enjoyed Volume 1 and had high expectations for Vol 2.After watching Volume 2 I am unbelievably disappointed. Nothing new or interesting was revealed, the story was a total letdown.If you think the second movie will bring something new to tale you are wrong, I wouldn't have believed it but you can already guess exactly what happens in Vol 2 by watching Vol 1. So apart from dragging it out a little more there is hardly any purpose for Vol 2, a simple sentence of what happened would easily conclude the story,it didn't need another 2hrs or more of rambling which had no real drama or action worthy of keeping our attention. It's certainly a movie I would never want to watch more than once!",1,23,46,30 June 2004
