The Blair Witch Project," Decay of US society
","At the beginning, I wasn't sure at all, if I should watch this movie. After I saw the DVD release in a video library and a short discussion with the employee ('C'est pas mal, Il faut Ã©prouver l'ambience') I decided to take as the 4th to loan. Take three get one for free. So I could at least say that I didn't pay anything to watch it. What I got to see was really horror to me. I've never seen a film of less quality before that. Does the young US population really speak like that. I really started to count the words like 'f**k' and 's**t' but after 500 I stopped...poor US culture. Another disappointment was the story that could told in three lines. 'Small groupe of highly educated Americans go in the woods with a map. Because they can't read it the can't find the way out and have delusions-probably drug withdraw'. Actually I fell asleep watching this 'movie'. I admit that this happened with other films before, but it was the first time that I didn't retake the 'overslept' chapters and in the end I didn't regret it. What does the film leave behind to me. Only the regret to have lost less than one hour of my life (I was sleeping the rest of it) and it didn't really improve my views on American (Beauty) society. If you there over the sea like this kind of holiday video that much, I will buy a camera and present my own in the cinema. At least it proved one thing. In the USA anything is possible. You can ever become a millionaire by making a very, very baaaad movie/video. Go on this way, I'll stay in Europe.",1,1,3,10 July 2000
