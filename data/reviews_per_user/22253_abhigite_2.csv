Moneyball," a nice and satisfying watch.
","Watched Moneyball the movie featuring Brad PittIts a movie about a guy who loves a sport, baseball to be precise. and wants to excel at it, or at least something to do with it. It is based on a real life story. Life of Billy Beane, who after few stints of being, highly promising, but unsuccessful player, turned out to be a General Manager of Oakland AthleticsThough it requires you to be abreast with the game of baseball, it history, and other dynamics to be able to enjoy the movie to its fullest, but still without them too, you can get pretty much what the movies is trying to convey. It makes you realize any dream, any philosophy, idea, thought, that you believe in, is worth following to the hilt, and of you do that, others will follow the suit.Though it's easier said than done, as to do so, you need the support system. you need to have emotional backup and also you need to have someone who is there to resurrect your faith when you are just about giving it up.Movie is well packed, with Brad Pitt delivering one heck of a performance ( that's the Yankee way of saying it ..), but I don't know what's with the 'eating/drinking in every scene', may be its his superstition for a good movie. He is doing it again, after ocean's eleven. Jonah Hill too was very effective as the pillar of strength, and the brains.Overall a nice and satisfying watch.",8,1,2,28 June 2014
Green Street Hooligans," It Soaks you into it, Worthy watch
","Green Street Hooligans  it is a movie which is like eating a tasty cake, feeling it melt in your mouth, arousing and enticing your taste buds, exhilarating your brain, and making you want more and more  but knowing that it is going to end  and hating that feel and knowledge of its inevitable end.It's like living that experience rather than watching it as an outsider, It's like getting owned by it rather than you owning it. That's what some movies ARE.Green Street Hooligans is a movie which is very British, and in more sense than one, but it makes you a part of it as the lead character is non British. Surprisingly this movie has been co-written and directed by a German, and that too a Lady, Lexi Alexander, and she delivers quite a punch.You live and understand it through the non-brit protagonist  and by the end of nearly two hours, when you see him singing ' I'm Forever blowing bubbles', you too join him and start singing the song no matter where you are,, being totally oblivious to your surroundings, like in my case a location in India. But you will going to sing it  thats what the movie does to you.",9,0,0,28 June 2014
