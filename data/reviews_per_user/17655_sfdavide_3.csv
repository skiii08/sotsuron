Casablanca," most romantic movie
","This is the most romantic movie of all time and possibly the best film. When a 'romantic' movie is made today the couple usually end up in bed on the first date. That is not necessarily romantic. All you have to look at the way Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman look at each other and you can tell that these two people are in love. That is real acting.From the beginning to the very end when we are not sure who Ilsa will choose, either Rick or her husband it is very exciting. Along with Bogart and Bergman Claude Rains, Paul Henreid and Conrad Veidt provide fine support. And of course there is 'As Time Goes By'.'Play it again..' and again and again",10,0,1,16 November 2004
Saw," Did Danny Glover need work this bad?
","'Saw' is the story of two guys who are locked in a room chained to a pipe. One of them is told he must kill the other and if he does his wife and child will not be killed. The only way they can get free is to cut through their foot. This film at no time thrilled or scared me like a thriller is supposed to do. I think the reason for this were the huge holes in the story and abysmal acting, if you call them actors. This film took 18 days to film and it shows.Now for some of these holes. First the cell phone worked in that environment. Mine never would have worked. It would not have gotten reception. Here comes the spoiler so if you have not seen the film do not read the rest of this. The killer was playing dead in the same room with these two guys and during the entire film he did not breathe or twitch a muscle. Then before he got up he let the doctor leave the room, not that he could get too far in this condition. Can we say witness. And lastly and more importantly even though the saws could not cut through the solid metal of the chain why didn't they cut through the pipes. Pipes are very thin and hollow. Now god forbid let us wait for Saw 2.",4,2,3,17 February 2005
Before Sunrise," Better then most romantic movies
",One of the most romantic movies of all time and by this I do not mean sexual. The story of two young people getting to know each other and falling in love over night in Vienna is very refreshing and real. I got the feeling that this was not a movie but a real experience between two people. Very romantic. I can see a time where either something like this has or can happen to me. Definitely the most 'real' romantic film I have seen. The actors are well matched and it is refreshing not to see a 60 yr old actor romancing a 30 yr old women. I really felt for these people which you do not find many times in movies today.I hope it gets a much bigger audience now that Before Sunset has been released on DVD,Null,1,3,7 November 2004
