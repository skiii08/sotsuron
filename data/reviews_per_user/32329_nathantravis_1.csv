Blade Runner 2049," Blade Running Time 2,049 Minutes
","I concur with the Red Letter Media Half in the Bag review. Beautiful looking film with a decent story, but the running time is too long. Trim it down to 2.5 hours or so to improve the pacing and it would be a better experience. Also would have been nice to keep Fords appearance out of the promotion material for maximum impact.",8,1,4,24 May 2018
