Scarface," The World is Yours
","Scarface. One of the greatest films of all time.Brilliant performances, directing and set design. This film is compiled of so many different themes that represent the time period excellently. The film acknowledges the impossibility that Tony Montana will never reach the American Dream through legal means and so shows his resort to crime. The story of Scarface is quite simply a rise from the bottom to the top. An amazing film and I love every second of every scene. Watch it right now!",10,2,4,20 February 2016
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Very Funny Film
","Personally, I think this is one of the most intelligent comedies ever made. Sure, it does have its share of simple slapstick and naughty moments, but generally, the topics the Pythons tackle here are very serious - albeit dealt with in a way that makes this a true contender for the funniest film of all time. A firework of hilarious sketches, timeless quotes and clever comments on the human condition, this film was deemed too dangerous for the masses and therefore, until recently, banned in several countries. This film never once makes fun of Jesus (Christ) - but it DOES take the mickey out of blind, fanatic followers of any political movement or religion. An outstanding achievement and endlessly re-watchable.",8,0,1,29 April 2018
Fight Club," A Statement of a Film
","Let's ignore the advice and talk about 'Fight Club'. This film was a milestone; although it bombed at the box office, Fincher's cinematic language left a mark that can still be felt now, 14 years later, on many current releases. The film has a raw energy that grips me every time I watch it. Whether it is a very clever satire or pure testosterone going on a rampage - both are fine by me. A film so visually stunning and sexy, with career best performances by all involved - welcome to movie heaven.",10,0,0,29 April 2018
The Jungle Book," Look For The...
","There aren't many animated Disney films I don't like; actually, I think every single one of them until the end of the seventies was amazing. But for me, this is the one that stands out. Wolfgang Reitherman has directed some of the studio's best - but here he has created his masterpiece. It has fantastic animation, fantastic characters - and what a killer soundtrack! This film will stay with me forever, and I'm so happy it was created.",10,0,0,29 April 2018
Deadpool 2," Good Fun
","After watching this film with the boys, I've gotta say it was pretty fun. Although the film probably isn't as good as the first Deadpool, I still think it was a good time and had some pretty funny moments. The plot was kinda crazy and there wasn't as many jokes as I expected but all the same, it was cool to see the characters again and the comedic wit of Ryan Reynolds. A pretty enjoyable film and cinema experience!",7,2,5,21 May 2018
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," We'll Meet Again...
","I never really bought into the Kubrick hype. I mean: don't get me wrong; I like all of his films very much - but to me, they all feel somewhat 'over-constructed' and lack a natural flow. And then I finally got to see 'Dr. Strangelove'. Wow. What a terrific, pitch black satire. This film is so wild and mean and funny - and Peter Sellers gives THE performance of his career. Unlike in any of Kubrick's later works, there's a sense of playfulness here that gives the whole movie a crazy kind of energy; I'm guessing that Seller's love for improvisation forced Kubrick to ditch his usual perfectionism to a certain degree (and the film is all the better for it). Sharp, outrageously entertaining comedy/satire by one of the most revered directors of the past century.",10,4,5,29 April 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Great Fun!
","Highly recommmend watching this film. Lot of fun seeing it with a group of friends. After seeing it at the cinema, it leaves you completely shocked, with plenty of great comedic and dramatic moments scattered throughout. Definitely one of the greatest Marvel films to date.",9,1,2,29 April 2018
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," God Will Be Cut
","Having seen some of Tarantino's previous films, when I first watched this, my expectations for 'Kill Bill' were already over the roof. However, regardless of my high hopes for quality entertainment, I was not prepared for this film. I was dumbfounded. I was blown away. I had quite simply never seen anything even remotely like it. In 'Kill Bill', the revenge plot serves only as a larger story arc, thus allowing Tarantino to play with as many different genres as he likes. With complete disregard for the conventions of filmmaking, he paints an expressionistic masterpiece in his own unique style, the likes of which the world has never seen before. This picture is a gift to the film industry and the world itself!",10,0,1,29 April 2018
Groundhog Day," I Got You Babe
","I'm a sucker for romantic comedies. This movie has as much charm as it has bite, thanks to a fantastic script and Murray's excellent performance. Never dull or cheesy, this wonderful fantasy tale just hits all the right notes, and if anyone knows a better rom-com, please name it. I've watched it countless times and, without a doubt, I will watch it again and again (or for as long as I keep waking up to that song by Sonny & Cher).",9,1,1,29 April 2018
How to Train Your Dragon," Lovely Film
","Warning: this beautifully animated tale is highly addictive! As soon as it's over you'll immediately want to watch it again. So much fun, never cheesy and for pure entertainment value quite simply the best animated film since 1967's 'The Jungle Book' (well, at least in my humble opinion). No surprise, given that co-director Chris Sanders has had a hand in every good Disney film starting with Aladdin until he left the mouse house in 2006 (and I suspect John Lasseter now regrets letting him go). And as much as I adore and admire pretty much every Pixar film, for this once, Dreamworks just had the movie with the higher 're-watchability factor' which makes it one of my favourites. See it!",9,0,0,29 April 2018
Pulp Fiction," The More You Watch, The Better It Gets
","Would it be too much to say Tarantino re-invented the cinema with this film? I can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone. You can tell - especially in gangster films - they never looked quite the same after 'Pulp Fiction'. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most quotable dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it's such a crazy, cool, fun ride that you feel stoned/dizzy/drunk after watching it eachtime. Despite originally thinking it was slightly overhyped, seeing it again and again has brought me to realise what it is. It's 'Pulp Fiction' and it's amazing.",10,10,18,29 April 2018
Die Hard," Ho Ho Ho
","Th is film is the ultimate thrill ride - action don't get any better than this classic. The formula has since been repeated so many times, but the original still sets the standard by which I judge an action film. Endless quotable moments, brilliant acting, and constructed better than any action film could dream about today. Should be seen every Christmas and thoughout the rest of the year.",10,0,0,29 April 2018
Jaws," Gonna Need a Bigger Boat...
","I will never forget the first time I saw Jaws. I was glued to the seat from start to finish. This was one of the experiences that made me fall in love with movies: I was there, in that boat, in that gloomy cabin, with those people - everything seemed so real (I will forever be afraid of the sea). And when I watch it these days I still marvel: the atmosphere and the performances in this film are simply magical. Spielberg, such a genius.",10,0,1,29 April 2018
The Shawshank Redemption," The Best Film of All Time
","The Shawshank Redemption is quite simply the greatest film of all time. I completely agree with the other reviews in that this film is something of the soul and can honestly have a huge impact on you. If there's only one film that you watch in life I think Shawshank would have to be the one I recommend the most - despite not being my favourite film of all time I still think it is the best. Undoubtably a 10/10, a complete masterpiece.",10,0,0,29 April 2018
Blade Runner," Like Tears in Rain...
","A feast for the eyes. Dark and uncompromising. With a haunting musical score by Vangelis that adds a hypnotic quality to those breathtaking landscapes of a mega-city in a dystopian future. To me, Ridley Scott's visionary masterpiece represents the ultimate Science Fiction film (and the final cut is the version to watch).",9,3,5,29 April 2018
The Matrix," Easily One of the Greatest Films
","The first time a film translated the visual style of comic books successfully to the big screen. A watershed moment in filmmaking and I suspect I'm not the only one who has seen this film time and time again, reminded how great it is with each viewing. Quite simply a kick-ass masterpiece. sci-fi movies that were released after 'Matrix' have tried very hard to achieve a similar look, but the original still owns them all. If you haven't seen this film, do yourself a favour and watch it now!",10,1,1,29 April 2018
The Godfather," Taking the Cannoli
","This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definite film.",10,1,2,21 May 2018
