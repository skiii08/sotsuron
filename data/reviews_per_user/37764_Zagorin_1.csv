United 93," Mixed feelings
","While watching this movie, I couldn't help getting the feeling that I was watching a propaganda piece. Besides that I found the storyline very dodgy to say the least. For example: the passengers are allowed to phone everyone they know and get the info that the plane will hit a (civil) target, while the terrorists are steering towards a big city? I believe the terrorist understood the English language, while we are told that they earned their experience to fly planes in USA. Another example: I was told that in reality they couldn't find the plane, here they show scattered material in the woods nearby, speculating that the plane crushed into tiny pieces. And last but not least: The melodrama in the left behind families was understood, but very very overdone.First I ask: Where is the plane? And second, if there was a plane, I believe the fighter-jets shot it down. Third: Where were the jets from Andrew airport? Fourth: If we believe the Twin Towers were an inside job, why should we believe the government saying that this plane was taken down by passengers? I give it a 6, but only in respect of the left-behind families.",6,2,8,26 January 2007
