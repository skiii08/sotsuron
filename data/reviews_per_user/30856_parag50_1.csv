The Ring," A classy horror film!!
","Every once in a while you come across films that leave a lasting imprint on your mind. 'The Ring' is most certainly one of these films that have started a new trend in horror movies! It almost makes it into the category of 'The Exorcist'. I did not move from start to the end just to find out what or who was killing the people who watched the video...and along the way I was taken on a roller coaster ride with many twists and turns in the story. And I can tell you honestly that when that moment arrived---the final scene---I was quite disturbed and terrified for a few hours after that!! However, at the end of the movie there were a few questions unanswered....I hope they are answered in the sequel due in 2005. After reading the other comments, it seems almost mandatory to watch the original Japanese version....but at least this time round I will know whats coming!!! If I was to rate this movie....it would be a perfect score just for its imagination and genuine horror!!!!",Null,1,2,24 November 2004
