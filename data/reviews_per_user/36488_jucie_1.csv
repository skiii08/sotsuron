Marie Antoinette," Many people will not appreciate this film; it take some patience and an open mind
","I really liked this movie. It was a bit long, and I can certainly see how some would be bored by it, but it flew by for me and I thought it was very entertaining. I've read many comments about the movie saying that it's historically inaccurate and that we hardly see any of the 'politics' of the era, but obviously this film is simply not about those things. We are seeing the world through Marie's eyes, the sheltered life that knows nothing of poverty or reality. We get to experience the decadence of her lavish lifestyle and see the beauty of her surroundings. I loved the mix of classical music and modern music, it made the film seem more youthful and fun; Marie is, after all, a teenager in most of the film. The acting is wonderful. The scenery and costumes are breathtaking. If you are going to see this movie, I think it's best to go into it with an open mind. Forget everything you know about Marie Antoinette and try to put yourself in her shoes. Just experience the film!",10,10,16,15 November 2006
