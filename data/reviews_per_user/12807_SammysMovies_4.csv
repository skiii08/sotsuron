Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Awesome as always!
","Pirates of the Caribbean on Stranger Tides is the fourth instalment in this franchise and it is definitely as good and entertaining as all previous films. In this one, Jack is trying to get to the fountain of youth with a lot of other peoples including Black Beard played by Ian Mcshane. Then follows the usual awesomeness you would expect from a pirates film!After the poor critics that received Pirates Of The Caribbean at world ends which I thought was really good but maybe the weakest of all four movies, this one had only one way to go and that's up. After 4 years On stranger Tides finally came out and it was fresh and inventive. It went back more to the routes of the first film which is considered to be the best. It was a fun entertaining Summer movie and that's why I think it's an awesome fun movie to watch. I Definitely recommend this one to anyone if you have not seen it yet.I can't wait for the next one(still a few years..)and I think this movie is excellent,definitely check it out! You won't regret!",7,0,1,9 March 2015
Bridge of Spies," Yet another great Spielberg/Hanks film!
","Bridge of spies is directed by Steven Spielberg who is probably the most prolific and well known director of all time. He directed movies such as Jurassic Park, ET , Jaws , Raiders of the Lost Ark and many more! Though Bridge of spies is more of a serious real life event movie like Schindlers list or Lincoln. It is the fourth time Spielberg and Hanks have joined to make a film and it is yet the fourth time that they've made a great movie! (Saving private Ryan, Catch Me if you can and the Terminal)This movie is masterfully crafted, acted, shot and directed. It's what you'd expect from a Spielberg film! Though this is not everyones piece of cake. I you like a lot of serious talking and great Oscar worthy performances like me, then you'll be more then pleased with Bridge of Spies. But if you like more action/adventure Spielberg films keep away from this one even though I'd still recommend it!Bridge of Spies is one of the year's best film and I cannot wait to see this masterfully made film once again. I would highly recommend this film to everyone except if your'e an average moviegoer who prefers big popcorn fun. Go examine Bridge of Spies from it's 2h20min run time and have a good time at the movies.",8,1,6,17 October 2015
Jurassic World," Summer Fun!
","Jurassic World is the 4th instalment in the very popular Jurassic Park franchise. Following the almost perfect Jurassic Park(1993), the good Â­ The lost World: Jurassic park(1997) and the alright but worst of the series Jurassic Park III(2001). Right off the bat, this movie is great! This is the definition of summer fun. I think that if you view this movie as a monster movie, you will have an immense fun with it. All from the world building of this movie to the great performance given by Chris Pratt I think that hands down the best sequel we have gotten since the original Jurassic Park. It's also a great family movie that everyone will enjoy. Definitely check this movie out, you will not regret it! The park is finally opened! Have fun!",7,27,66,12 June 2015
The Matrix," One of the best Sci-Fi Action Movies.
","The Matrix was released in 1999 and had an immense impact on pop culture. It's a movie that inspired countless filmmakers and that was widely acclaimed at release. It went on to gross around 500 million U.S.D at the box-office for a budget of 63 million. Directed by the Wachowski brothers (now sisters), and starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss, The Matrix is a sci-fi action movie that takes inspiration from Anime and Kung-Fu flicks. Neo, a tech geek who's life revolves computers, is told one day that he's the savior of a world in which robots have taken control and that the reality he believes is true is actually all fake. The real world has gone to ashes and everyone is being controled by robots. Canadian actor, Keanu Reeves who is not known for his acting capabilities, fits the role of Neo very well, as does his colleagues for their respective roles. This movie was revolutionary in it's amazing action sequences which feature dazzling special effects that are to this day very impressive. What The Matrix does, that few other 90's action movies were able to do, is to blend amazing action sequences with a story that challenges the watcher and that has a deep message. This movie is famously known for it's futuristic message about technology and society that's innovative and scarily plausible. Obviously, The Matrix couldn't have been as good as it was without the amazing score by Don Davis and the cinematography helmed by Bill Pope. The score mixes electronic and futuristic type beats that fits perfectly the computer imagery that's central to the movie. The cinematography had a big role in the impact of the action scenes. It's beautiful and really different. The « Bullet Time » sequence is still known as a milestone in cinematography and a great achievement. It's a movie that is more suited for youngsters and fans of sci-fi and action but I would still recommend it to anyone who's a fan of quality entertainment. Sure, the plot of the Matrix is nothing new. We have seen it countless other times, but it has never been done like this and as efficiently. The Matrix is a revolutianary movie that has had an immense impact on cinema. It is one of the very best sci-fi action movie of all time. 10/10 – Amazing.",10,0,1,26 November 2017
