Casablanca," I cant believe this jewel was made so long ago
","I was born 37 years after the debut of this film and I love it. That says it is a masterpiece. It tells a story so wonderfully. There is wit, humor, intrigue, politics, great characters, fine acting, a beautiful woman, and fine editing. It is a story of hope and good will.It makes one want to be a part of the time period and the setting. It is a very intelligent film using tactful techniques to reveal character traits. And best yet, it has a difficult to guess ending.It is clean entertainment and you forget that it is in black and white because the story and characters and one song are so wonderful.I was skeptical about watching this film at first, held on to it for 6 months before actually watching it, and I'm glad I got the film because it's now a favorite.",9,1,2,1 March 2005
Monster," how if felt watching this film
","I went into the theatre without an idea of what the film was aside from the fact that I'd heard theron would look 'ugly'....I'd just told my gf that if an actress purposely looks ugly, the film must be good since it's worth is more likely carried on dramatic performance.  It is become cliche in hollywood in recent years...the truth of that statement...but I didn't think it would be as true as I realized it to be.I was deeply moved and for moments disturbed by this film.  Certain scenes made me seriously contemplate getting up and leaving the theatre.  But I am glad that I stayed because theron's portrayal of 'a dying soul' was breathtaking.",Null,0,0,6 February 2004
Before Sunrise," wow what can I say
","this movie is in my list of top 15 that I've seen in my 25 years of life. It has a truly magical combination of sincere actors doing fantastic uninhibited acting, superb editing, seamless directing, succulent lighting, severe romance, suspenseful character revelations, voyeuristic feel, and original concepts.This movie is 'balls deep' as my wild friends would say. This means the production really went out on a limb to try to film something so simple and complex at the same time in the hope that it would succeed. In my book, it has satisfied and stimulated.It is better than Pizza hut stuffed crust in NY",Null,1,3,1 March 2005
