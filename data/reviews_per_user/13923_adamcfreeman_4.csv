Black Swan," Wow! I was left speechless.
","I should start this by saying that I have high expectations of Aronofsky. All of his feature films have gone various directions with great success. Out of everything that I've ever seen, nothing has managed quite the impact that Black Swan has. I almost never rate anything at the top of the chart, but this film makes it. I was completely speechless at the end.In a nutshell, this film is predictable, especially if you're a fan of David Lynch. Even though Aronofsky has proved himself to be an excellent director and creative mastermind, he is still growing. That said, while I knew where this film was going, and how it was going to get there, I was still shocked at most of the events. The whole film starts very slowly, much like Aronofsky's other works. As things start to happen, tension starts to build.The main character (Nina, played by Natalie Portman) pushes herself to become the star of a reworking of Swan Lake. We always hear about great art requiring sacrifice and suffering, but this role for Nina is nothing that her years of rigorous training could have prepared her to handle. Unlike many other films that play on the drama created between competition for coveted positions, Aronofsky keeps the main focus on Nina, the tumult under her surface, and how that impacts everything around her. Her producer (Thomas) demands much, pushing and pulling her in directions she's never explored. In the end, the work by Nina and Thomas leads to a phenomenal, new rendition of Swan Lake.",10,1,3,25 December 2010
Pacific Rim," This is how Transformers should have looked.
","I am the last person who would choose to pay the exorbitant prices for admission to a theater for this kind of entertainment... and I really liked it.Not once during this film did I stop and think 'Hey, that's CGI, even if it is well done.'. On the contrary, I would have little trouble believing this was actual footage. The water looked fantastic, metal glistened beautifully, and the monsters were actually kind of scary.As far as I'm concerned, an action film should be entertaining, and Pacific Rim did that better than I've seen in a long time. No sex, no plot twists, no leaps of logic, just suspension of disbelief. This is no Bergman work, and Del Toro didn't try to make a mental labyrinth. Take this film at face value for what it is: A beautifully done film with fantastic special effects that only aims to entertain. From my vantage point, this was a chance to have fun making a piece of art, and show off.",9,2,9,14 July 2013
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Save your time and your money.
","I'm not sure that I can offer much more about how almost all of the characters are less than two-dimensional, and more forgettable than the faces of other people in line at a grocery store.I found myself wondering how this Jesse James got his name in the title without actually doing anything in the film. Saying that this film is about the legacy and death of such an infamous gangster/gun-slinger is like saying that Forrest Gump highlighted the failure that was the Vietnam war.Basically, 3:10 to Yuma exemplified the energy, valor, and excitement that The Assassination... needed. I'll grant that the scenery is kind of nice, but it's lost amid the clutter of bodies and plot pieces that are littered through the film.In my experiences, many of the finer films do require a second or third viewing before much of the nuances can be appreciated. Eraserhead, Dogville, Full Metal Jacket, they're loaded with symbolism and messages. This film left me reaching for meanings, trying to find some hint of an idea, but I was completely baffled and disappointed.By giving this collection of scenes such a low review, I find myself wondering if everyone who gives it a high review has just convinced themselves that they liked it; sort of a way of dealing with a severe trauma.",1,13,24,22 June 2010
Hellboy," This was made by Guillermo del Toro?
","First, this is not science-fiction, it's blatantly fantasy. I am not a comic-book reader, so I had no experience with this universe prior to the film.As a film, it was pretty good. When I say 'as a film', I'm addressing it as nothing more than a piece of entertaining cinema, like the Back to the Future series, anything Hellraiser, or Fantasia. As entertainment, I'm not looking for anything metaphorical or metaphysical. The presence of deep-seated questions doesn't ruin a film, but they shouldn't distract me from it. Cases in point: Event Horizon, Robots.For Hellboy, I suspended judgement of the film based on the title because superstitious terminology and imagery are ubiquitous and unavoidable throughout most of the world and literary history. Besides, Hellraiser, even using such a fantastic and superstitious title, doesn't bring excessive religious ideology into the film.I'll spare appeals to the idea of this film being religiously alienating because of the main character, as the ideas of 'devil' and 'hell' are concepts that have been propagated through literature for thousands of years. What angers me most is the devotion to the idea that one can only be 'human' through Christianity. This is outrageous, insulting, belittling... there aren't words sufficient to describe how offensive it is to discriminate against someone based on their superstitions. Racism is low, sexism is low, classism is low, implied discrimination based purely on religious views is truly despicable.I had no interest in this film until I noticed it on Guillermo del Toro's IMDb page. Maybe I missed something in his other work, or maybe I'm expecting too much from him, but I won't be jumping at his other films with the kind of zeal that I did before.",5,0,4,6 July 2010
