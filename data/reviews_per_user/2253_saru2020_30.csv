Ford v Ferrari," Only for car/race lovers
","This seems to have been made only for car race/sports fans.
Cannot imagine how worst it'd have been if the 2 main characters would've played by someone else than Christian Bale & Matt Damon.
Although this is purely a biographical make, it had some stunning race sequences but it didn't please me much, maybe because I expected a lot and maybe the addition of commercial elements could've been a good engagement factor but there seemed to be nothing except a clash with the executive on a decent note.",6,0,2,7 January 2020
First Man," Dramatic / Emotional/ Historical
","Very slow paced movie made completely from the perspective of Neil Armstrong, it was exhilarating a bit during/along the journey as it gave us a feel of traveling along with the crew and it mostly resembled about how someone going for the first time would see and feel.
Also, it described some of the issues like political, public outrages, deaths involved at that time, it clearly depicted how the situation itself was being in the shoes of the protagonist. The storytelling was good enough, dramatic enough to keep the patient audiences engaged.",6,1,3,12 July 2019
Source Code," Conceptualized Looping
",One of the good movie based on the Looping concept. Watched it with a huge expectation after reading some spoilers hence was not a big surprise to me except a few tid bits.,7,0,0,25 March 2018
Memento," Ghajini is not Copied
","For all these years, I had a presumption that its no different than Ghajini(Tamil/Hindi), but I was totally wrong. It was way different, actually there was no link b/w them except the concept(that too was modified). But, seriously the movie let me into a dilemma, I didn't get to understand it completely even after watching it after 18years, may be I'll have to watch it multiple times to get it. 
I liked the way the movie went backwards breaking all the screenplay rules. I get it on why it is called as one of the cult classics.",8,1,1,31 March 2018
Captain Marvel," Why her? Why?
","I didn't understand why this super-heroine came into existence.
It was obvious that this is like a prelude for her in order to display her in the Marvel's biggest upcoming Avengers venture and nothing else. But still why her?",4,15,22,29 March 2019
12 Monkeys," 25 years and it still entertains
","I thought that watching this time-travel movie after nearly 25 years of its release would be very easy for me to understand but this piece of goodness still seems to be not fully understandable. But, fortunately, I got the whole thing only after a little bit of overthinking and blog reading about its explanation.
If it is definitely good to watch even after 2 years then it is definitely a masterpiece for sure.",7,0,0,7 October 2019
Knives Out," Amazing twists & turns
","Easily one of the most intriguing, mystery solver movies of all time. Just fantastically made with a nicely told storyline that keeps you on the edge on the seat, the climax is the one that you had expected throughout but not exactly in the way you did, it just makes you feel surprised.
The last one similar to this was a Tamil movie: Dhuruvangal 16",5,2,3,24 December 2019
Creed," An average for me
","Watching it after Creed 2, it feels like very close.
Gave a feel of the next generation Rocky coming up, the characterisation was done nicely for all, proper justification for the plot, but still it felt like it could've been better with more nerve bursting, goose bumps scenes as its plot still could've adopted it.
Overall, its an average and one time watch just to get to know the characters to watch further ones in the series.",5,1,1,12 December 2018
Aquaman," Visually Amazing
","One of the best visually treating films.
Watching it in iMax gave an extraordinary feel, it almost felt like a real one.
Although the story line is very very old, the making, screenplay, and mostly the visual experience is the one that captured me.",8,7,15,19 December 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," A very normal installment
",They kinda spoiled the franchise by adding some humor presuming that it would work but it just spoiled the seriousness a bit. Thor w/o hammer was a bit unpredictable and nothing else was. Just a very normal second installment.,5,0,3,25 March 2018
Ready Player One," VR based Cartoon movie
","The extremists' idea on how the future would look like, if VR/AR took over the world, that is the simple idea over which a game is build and the whole world gets addicted to it and they start to live more in the virtual world than in their real world, that's the crux. But, almost the whole movie just goes on in the virtual world & very less real world scenes are shown, maybe because the now/2045 real world looks very ugly.
But, for the viewer, it feels like watching the cartoon movie overall on a high level and mostly like the replay of the video game itself, which nobody ever likes, but with few thrills and an imaginable futuristic plot, it somewhat keeps us going but in the end, for the adults who don't play that much games and for those who don't like being addicted to the games will get irritated and simply thrash the movie w/o ever looking at its vast plot, imaginary future world creation, awesomatic VFX shots.",5,0,1,18 November 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Amazing visuals
","9th part and still going strong.
Watching it on IMAX gives so much of an immersive experience with stunning visuals but since whenever the dark world was shown, the lightening effect was giving an irritating feel.
Although, I'm not a star wars fanboy and haven't watched all of its episodes, from the audience's reaction it looks like most of the characters were definitely involved/portrayed in this installment.",8,2,12,24 December 2019
Watchmen," Strictly for comic fans, I believe
","This is strictly for comic fans, almost half of the movie shows a side storyline in animated version and there seems to be not much comparison with the actual storyline of the film.
The characterisation of Dr. Manhatten(blue man) is designed in a fantastic way, where he's given almost a god-like power but the group where he's placed isn't right at all. Why does a god-like superhero be in a group with powerless & shameless and only superhero-like dressed crappy humans? This is a huge flaw in the writing itself and seeing it as a movie is like treating the treating the audience as bloody fools.
The making was well good enough, the screenplay was engaging enough and the twist in the climax was also satisfactory but the it was lengthy as hell, finally it felt like having watched 2-3 movies in parallel.
Except the blue man's characterisation and an extended sex scene, nothing really stays in mind finally.",4,1,1,13 April 2020
The Italian Job," Still Good
","Watched it recently in 2018, after nearly 15years of its release but it still kept engaged which is a very good sign for an amazing movie. Never mention, many of its scenes were simply copy pasted in several movies in the following years.",6,0,0,16 August 2018
Ocean's Eleven," Not bad still
",Watching it after nearly 17 years and still not bad which automatically equals to the best in those times.,6,0,1,9 August 2018
Avengers: Endgame," Heavily expected still sarisfied
","This is the first and foremost english movie which i've/we've watched the opening show in the morning at 5am. As it marks the end of the decade long marvel collection of movies, we were very much thrilled to watch the movie asap, but still we got tickets only on the next day. It was definitely one of the fascinating experience as the movie was filled with so many things like time travel, actions, emotions, suspense, it is definitely the most anticipated movie as everybody knows but the fact that it still manages to entertain is where the movie makers excel, hats off to pull off such a massive thing. But making my favourite Iron Man disappear in the end was unexpected and long lasting.
In tamil Vijay Sethupathis' voice was just set into our sub conscious very well so it didn't set too much to the movie from the point of view of general audience like us.",9,1,3,3 May 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Souless Movie
","It felt like this part was just a merger of all Marvel super heros with no powerful subject/story line and they just tried to give a gist of what we can expect next from the series, it felt like a total crap. It felt like they wasted not using the super heros to their core. 
But the visuals were amazing and the villian/Thanos was stagerring. That was all.",5,1,2,6 May 2018
Aladdin," SONGS, Animations, Monkey, Genie
","SONGS, SONGS, and SONGS.
The whole movie travels with the songs, starting off with the kids' storytelling hence it gives a bit of the fairy tales feels.
This clearly indicates that it was purely targeted for the kids whose native language is English.
But, why did they copy the Bollywood formula? Yuck. Bollywood is going down the lane, boss.
Although it has some of the finest animations and is definitely a visual treat to have watched in IMAX, the core concept being one of the renewed, the movie could've been made much more interesting by introducing few more characters like the naughty monkey and with few more twists and turns and instead of showing the mouth's of the characters singing, the scenes could've been elevated by showing something else and combining all of these pieces of advice would've kept the audiences engaged.",5,0,5,4 June 2019
The Lion King," Tamil Dubbing was fabulous
","Didn't meet the expectation, maybe because I watched it in a not-so-good theatre.
It might've been a better movie if added with some more twists & turns.
The Tamil dubbing was just fabulously done, the artist selection was phenomenal.",6,1,3,5 August 2019
A Quiet Place," Fabulous Movie
","One of the fantastic movies of the decade for sure.
The movie just quickly takes you through a whole new world of silence and while you're simply awestruck the movie ends very quickly just around an hour. But finally, you'll feel like have gone on an exhilarating ride.
Very well written, made/executed and edited.",9,0,0,4 June 2019
The Imitation Game," Nice one on WW2
","Nicely depicts the world war scenario, the tricks by British intelligence and their team.
Alan Turing's role was nicely played & conveyed by the actor bringing in the actual scene in front of us. It was fascinating to see the works of their team to crack the german's enigma, the communication machine.",8,0,0,24 December 2019
2001: A Space Odyssey," A brilliantly made masterpiece
","Watching it after nearly half a century and it still feels as if it was released just recently except its long dialogue-less scenes. This itself makes this film one of the gem. It is definitely one of the masterpiece In Cinema, nothing more to say beyond that.
This film is not for the common audience as it has so many inter-linked layers which makes it suitable only for those who like decrypting the layers and finding out the linkages between the scenes and filling up the gaps with their our versions.
Thankfully, there are so many demystifications out there if you're not one of those creative types and the beauty of this film is that it fits into any of those decrypts, because that's how generic it is intentionally made by the creator such as to let the audiences to fill the gap as per their imaginations, which again makes this film as a very unique film.",10,3,4,9 February 2020
Pulp Fiction," I don't understand what it has that its been called as Cult
","Watching it 28years after its release, i don't get the point of whats there in the movie & why its called as one of the cult classics? Maybe it broke the typical single genre kind or it was seen as a crazy uninterlinked parallel set of 3 stories mixed or may be the crazy dialog that gave it so much fame? I don't know seriously. But many old guys call it as the best, just for that sake, I'll give it an average rating.",5,2,5,21 April 2018
The Shape of Water," Expected - Boring Oscar Movie
","As expected, it was a boring Oscar winning movie. 
The romantic tale b/w a lonely women & an alien with no gripping story/screenplay, simply nothing.",3,22,55,7 April 2018
Joker," Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha hahahahahahahahaha hahahaha hahahaha
","The character was played flawlessly, no words to describe it, it felt like Joaquin Phoenix is the new machinist Christian bale, just by looking at the kinda body he has made for this movie. Being the backstory of the supervillain, I expected some personal attack but this was merely based upon the jobless scenario that happened over the country a few decades back, which means there should be several other super villains as well.
About Acting: Sometimes while watching the movie, it felt that Kamal Hassan from Tamil cinema has done so much variety of actings that cannot even be recreated by these Hollywood folks. Hmmm.",4,9,40,7 October 2019
Parasite," COPYCAT - HIGHLY OVERRATED
","This is VERY HIGHLY OVERRATED.
just don't understand what makes this movie so special that it has been appraised so highly. It is not even 10% of the Tamil movies at this level/standard.
People who're praising this movie must start watching Tamil movies instead of Korean, there are so many gems that have gone unnoticed.
There is really nothing special in this movie that stands out.
Cannot digest that an average movie like this has got so much limelight. Btw: Where does this trend start off?",4,3,27,12 January 2020
Black Panther," Poor Characterisation
","Definitely a different film with more in depth technicalities on new tech but it lacks a gripping story/screenplay/dialogues and mostly the characterisation was not so heavy to hold upto that character's potential, to be specific. It somehow in the corner of the heart felt like a childish movie.",6,3,5,17 April 2018
Creed II," Nothing much
","Not so engaging, no good story, no good screenplay, not many fights, but just talking all over the film. There was a goosebumps moment in the 2nd boxing round in the climax fight and nothing more.
This is the first movie that i've ever watched in this franchise.",4,1,5,30 November 2018
Looper," Predestination-paradox: A somewhat followable one
","A very good & somewhat followable time-travel movie.
There are totally 3 timelines involved in the movie, which could've been told nice with some label/captions that might've reduced the complexity of it.",5,1,4,7 October 2019
The Godfather," Epic
","It is no wonder that the milestone tamil movies like Pudhupettai & Chekka Chivantha Vaanam were heavily inspired from it.
The movie starts with an astounding performance of a guy who later is magnified with few events/dialogues and gets introduced to us as a Gangster/Don/GodFather, although the movie feels more dramatic with a whole lot of family/dramatic scenes, it never keeps us unengaged and later when the unexpected hierarchy of kid gets to pick up the left overs by the big guy with a parallel eventful formation of a new don built upon the legacy of it as the climax forms the crux for its series as a whole.",8,1,2,18 February 2019
