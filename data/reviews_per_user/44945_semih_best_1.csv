Conquest 1453," hard truth
","This whole review section: English people not being able to accept the past. Yes it was exaggerated at some parts, but this wasn't a documentary nor educational video. Comments like: 'The part where they dragged the ships over land was only 1 minute'. Of course it is not done in one minute, but would you like to watch days of ships being dragged over land? The film gave the viewer adrenaline, not education. And to be honest, it gave Turkish people proud. I watched this movie in Rotterdam Path√© cinema. At the end of the movie the whole room of more than 400 people were applauding. The first and last time I had ever experienced such thing.",8,2,8,27 June 2015
