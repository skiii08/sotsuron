Black Swan," Black Swan
","Great scenario. Overall a very good movie.Disturbing was the lesbian scene and a few other self-gratification places. Scary spots were very compelling, but made generally huge excitement.Also, I really liked the cast great job. Natalie Portman played role was deffently worth its Oscar . He played a character which touched viewers and made very engaging feelings .Film director Darren Aronofsky deserves a huge thank, because the content was very good and of course excellent film-work.I recommended this movie to everyone and you are not going to get bored during the movie.",8,0,1,2 March 2011
