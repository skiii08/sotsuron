Blade Runner 2049," Almost as bad as the first
","...and in some ways worse. For example, at least the first one wasn't 800 hrs long. Holy bleep. I got about 30 mins in before debating if I should turn it off. I thought wow, are you kidding me, they are making the same mistakes as they did with the first one...glacial (and in this one, overly complicated) plot, vapid script, uninteresting characters, cheap tricks like pointless nudity etc, and by now a hideously worn out 'noir' theme....oooh it's always dark, it rains a lot, oooh everyone wears dark clothes and is depressing or manic or otherwise a waste of flesh. But no worries, everyone will love it because Harrison Ford is back and ooooh 'THE IMAGERY'....and sadly, they were apparently right, as it seems to be getting mostly positive reviews. Which is laughable. This film drones on and on AND on like some Chinese water torture. I can't count how many times my mind started drifting because it was that uninteresting. Don't ask me why I didn't just turn it off, but in the name of mercy pls don't make another one. That would be like making 'Jaws 10' (or whatever).",1,4,7,16 June 2018
The Village," Solid effort that prompted a lot of odd extremist reactions
","I'm amazed how polarizing this film apparently was (I guess I'm one of the last to see it for the first time). I guess I'm one of the few who didn't think it was so amazing, but didn't hate it either. It is not without flaws. More time should have been spent on character development/interaction and yeah, I couldn't really buy the disappointing and implausible ending which people claim they 'knew' ahead of time (suurre you did), but it wasn't so terrible. And I was in fact glad as it unfolded that it wasn't a silly 'thriller/horror' flick as I feared it might be and the final ending it didn't stop the film from being well worth the watch overall. The acting (esp Howard and Brody) is excellent, and they did an excellent job of having people sound and act like people in an isolated village of the (earlier, I think, not late) 19th century probably would have...which is extremely rare. If I had a nickel for every period piece where the people talked and acted more or less like people of today, eliciting an eye roll and 'let's see what else is on' from me, I'd be rich. That alone deserves huge props. And the directing and cinematography was very good as well. In short, not perfect, but still a good effort.",7,0,0,16 January 2019
The Shape of Water," The shape of...theatrical barf
","I can't believe the pathetic poopfest movies that are getting such high acclaim lately, with this being the latest and perhaps most baffling. Let's see: mute girl falls in love with the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Yeah, great idea for a movie. Not. Are you kidding me? If this had been made as a farcical B movie it might have been worth a 'well nothing better is on' watch, but it's not. This movie actually takes it self seriously and expects us to do the same, despite a completely absurd premise couldn't be worse, and one which was horribly butchered to boot. We start with completely pointless nudity and shots of our star masterbating (that probably scored big points with the Hollywood crowd - no wonder it won awards), then we're introduced to a series of characters, none who are at all likable, believable, or even interesting, including an absurdly cliched Dr Evil type who wants nothing more than to kill/torture our poor Black Lagoon dude. We're given nothing even the tiniest bit believable in terms of how/why this girl falls in love with fishface, even for a movie. And, being Hollywood, they make sure to go out of their way to toss the race card in your face now and again (God forbid that be left out of a movie!), despite that having basically nothing to do with the movie (no doubt why it was places in the 60s). The script (at least early on) was like Don King's hairdo, frequently shooting off in haphazard, unrelated, and pointless ways. I could go on and on, but unlike the movie, I'll be merciful and stop there. But basically don't waste your time.",1,12,21,20 June 2018
Blade Runner," All form, little substance
","This is easily one of the most overrated sci fi flicks ever. I challenge anyone to read the screenplay the whole way through without falling asleep. Yes, it's very visual and Vangelis did a good, appropriate (not amazing) soundtrack to give it that dark depressing 'dystopia' bit....OK, fine...but that's it. No characters of even the tiniest interest to either love OR hate, a laughably bumbling love angle, and almost zero action except for one brief flurry around half-way through and another at the end. Speaking of which, a totally stupid ending...not Roy saving Decker, that was a great idea (and where it should have ended), but then Decker and Rachel hooking up and going....? where? And do we care? No. This movie was loaded with over-the-top pretentiousness and about zero believability, even given the premise. I saw it in the 80s and went 'eh.' I just saw it now for the first time since then, as I was interested in the new one and wanted this as a base, but found it's even worse than I remember. Read the review titled 'So very very boring'....a bit harsh but sums it up fairly well (and is more entertaining than this entire film).",2,5,11,3 June 2018
