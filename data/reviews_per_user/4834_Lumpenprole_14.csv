Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," meh
","This movie kinda killed the whole Star Wars thing for me.  I remember actually being disturbed that I was bored thirty-minutes into the film. Being bored was pretty much the last thing I expected.Aside from the ambitious animation, everything seemed diminished.  The Force went from being a limitless potential that some people were in tune with to something you test for like AIDS, pregnancy or allergies.  Hammy characters like Vader and Han Solo (or even Leia's inexplicable haughty phase) gave way to one of the blandest casts I've ever seen in any film not by Antonioni. The brittle American Graffiti/jet engine aesthetic of the ships in the first films is gone in favor of glossy-plastic ships that dissolve into explosions.  The clumsily abrupt scenes separated by wipes were replaced by interminable sequences of clunky dialogue.  I never thought that there would be a step down from Ewoks, but there's Jar Jar.I think this film exterminated much of the devoted Star Wars fanbase in the same way that Voyager thinned the ranks of Star Trek fans.  I went to see Nemesis recently and couldn't help but notice that there weren't throngs of people who had been camped out in Starfleet uniforms awaiting the opening. Ditto with Attack of the Clones - the population of costumed campers had dwindled to almost nothing.  (Now they're all wearing Lord or the Rings outfits and designing Matrix fansites - Lucas pretty much lost them, which, despite what he says, has to matter to someone who built an empire on merchandising to exactly those people.)  Another indication of this falling off is the degree to which the new films have failed to penetrate the wider culture.  You can still quote Darth Vader and people know what you're talking about.  Say `use the force, Luke' and almost anyone on earth knows what you mean.  Does anyone quote the Phantom Menace?  Ever?  The only reference to the Phantom Menace that I think pretty much anyone could get is Jar Jar Binks, universally understood to be an unwelcome annoyance.The choreography of the final saber duel was really wonderful (even though Darth Maul dies standing there like an idiot while Obi-wan flips over him and stabs him in a move that doesn't seem much more impressive than any of the other moves that Maul previously shrugged off.)  Even so, when I think back on 1999 sci-fi fun, The Phantom Menace pretty much sucks compared to The Matrix and the video game Half-Life.  Actually, now that I think about, playing Jedi Knight II is much more fun than watching PM.  Also, the console flight-sim based on PM was mediocre.NOTE:  Of course it was the forth-highest grossing film in history.  It's Star Wars!  There are tens of millions of us that HAD to see the extension of the movies that were the most influential franchise of our childhood and changed Hollywood.  If Titanic II is ever made by Cameron and the latest teen stars, it would bring in a similar (but probably not nearly as huge) tidal wave of people that had to see for themselves if the magic cotton candy of their teens could come again.  Lucas could have made the Phantom Menace ten times worse than it is and it still would have had an opening weekend that set records.",3,0,1,19 June 2003
Minority Report," The first two-thirds are excellent
","Spoilers here,Spielberg movies tend to rehash really conservative plots - the mad scientist overreaching, the swashbuckler on a quest, the buddy movie and so on.  Spielberg's inspired moments are what he brings to these old plots. Minority Report is the cop-on-the-run plot.  A semi-likable cop is on to something, is framed, runs from the police to a world unfamiliar to him, and then vindicates himself in some big public scene where the guilty party eats crow.  It's like Peter Weir's Witness and any number of other movies.Peter Weir used the cop-on-the-run plot to show his cop trying to move through a world where his violence and way of living were completely rejected.  In the best parts of Minority Report Spielberg shows his cop on the run from a world where civil liberties and free will no longer exist. Throughout the film there is the ominous presence of a diseased nanny state that probes into the homes and bodies of its citizens.  At the beginning of the movie's action, the state has finally probed into the mind, into the very intent to commit an act.  Spielberg brings this awesomely dark vision of society home with the metaphorical `family.'  Von Sydow's Burgess character and Smith's Dr. Hineman characters make several references to themselves as the parents of the `precogs.'  There is much discussion of their status as wards of Burgess and the eerie history of their abilities - born with nightmarish visions of impending murders as a result of the drug abuse of their parents.  Instead of curing them of this horrific condition, Hineman and Burgess keep them in a big tub of drugs to harvest their nightmares.  Without a doubt, it's the most ghoulish vision Spielberg has conjured up.And this theme continues when Cruise's Anderton character is taken on a tour of the people he's had incarcerated.  Once under the complete control of the state, they suffer a fate very similar to the precogs - suspended in a tank with the brain still running.  The implication of the subplot (of Pre-Crime going national) is that this is where we will all be, as people surrender to the encroaching state.  For the first two thirds of the film, it seem that machines are constantly crawling into people's eyes and into their brains.There was a lot in the film that I liked. The special effects in Minority Report were excellent, imaginative and made the world of the movie seem bigger.  The breathtaking DC commute and entry to Anderton's condo looked like they came from one, consistent world (Where Attack of the Clones invariably looked like a bunch of people wandering around a green stage clearly smaller than the jumbled action).The action sequences were exciting and really brought home the idea that Anderton may be a pre-crime cop as much for the thrill of the chase as stopping the crimes that took his son.The casting was great and the writing had a couple of gems in it.The only problem with Minority Report is that, like AI, the last third sucked.  There is a line about how all your dreams come true once you've been incarcerated in the tube, but that's not really enough.  It's Spielberg trying to have it both ways - a dark movie and a longer conventional one. As I mentioned at the beginning, the plot is the most standard thing about Minority Report.  The last half hour relies almost completely on a plot that is really really worn out.  I think it's safe to say that we all knew that Burgess was behind the setup.  I think we all knew that Burgess would be unmasked in front of everyone (I felt like I was watching The Fugitive again, which is the same plot with a hunter-and-hunted plot thrown in). Watching it get played out was boring.  The development of the eye theme, the free will convolutions, and all the wonderful fx just stopped for the last half hour in order to make room for a perfunctory happy ending.",7,0,0,26 July 2002
Se7en," genre film with some style
","I thought this movie was a pretty remarkable exercise in style and an incredibly controlled performance by Morgan Freeman.  Most of it is kinda cliched Â– the retiring cop breaks-in a rookie (by-the-book vs. the loose cannon working on a hunch), the clever serial killer, the soulless city, the standard noir ending where the searcher realizes that he is what he's been searching for and so on. The art direction is wonderful, with a real attention to detail. The movie makes for riveting viewing the first time around.  I find myself skipping chapters though when I try to watch it again.To make the last act measure up to the first hour of the movie, I think the writing should have emphasized the idea that the wrath/envy set up was an example of John Doe improvising after the detectives found his apartment. The wrath/envy scene doesn't have nearly the convoluted menace of the Sloth or Gluttony scenes.  It's a noir thriller and Gwen is unaccounted for - the end seemed pretty obvious to me compared to the craziness of 'HELP ME' in fingerprints.",7,3,4,21 January 2002
The 13th Warrior," At least the gore is satisfying (spoilers)
","An unlucky film that was hoping to exploit the market for costume epics spawned by Braveheart in the late 1990s.  The writing is feeble and the editing is a last ditch attempt to salvage a mess created when McTiernan left the movie during production.  (Disney clearly had no hope for it and quietly farted it out in the Fall without any fanfare.)  The plot centers on an Arab diplomat in the 10th century that traveled among the Vikings and is recruited to fight the Eaters of the Dead with them.  The plot of Beowulf is used for about 20 minutes of the film.  After a bunch of hints about monsters and magic and so on, the villains turn out to be the same marauding army of morons that show up in many action movies.  They rape, pillage and say `har har' a lot.  They're the same bunch from the bad Mad Max films, bad Stallone films and basically bad action films.  In this movie, they mass for a great assault of guys in makeup and dishrags vs. the Vikings.  Sorta like Thunderdome, but no fun.  Like all evil hordes, they just lose the will to fight the outnumbered heroes when their ridiculous leader dies.  The Eaters of the Dead start the film as wraiths that move with superhuman speed and agility.  By the end they're about as menacing as stormtroopers running into Ewok traps.The 13th Warrior is not great for MST3k purposes unless you really enjoying digging into Antonio Banderas' acting style.  I like watching $100 million flops in the same way that I enjoy Ed Wood movies.  The number of people posting here that actually admire this 90-minute accident kinda amazes me. Looking over them I noticed that 13th does indeed have a couple plot elements in common with Seven Samurai.  I never thought of it because when I think of the Seven Samurai the first thing that comes to mind are those seven concrete personalities working together.  I can't remember a single Viking from 13th, except that one was the big leader and another was the talkative joker who grinned a lot.Without a doubt, this film has one of the most perfunctory `insert love interest here' subplots ever filmed.It's also interesting for the most obviously lopsided climatic fight scene since the giant Wesley Snipes went head-to-head with the dapper Stephen Dorff in Blade.If you're familiar with the history or Beowulf, it's kinda a weird experience to spend a whole film with one eyebrow arched in mild disbelief and confusion.",4,0,1,17 June 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," cute
","Fun film.  It's the first time I've seen Depp do a crowd-pleasing lead.  His Jack Sparrow is pretty much standard Deppian posturing which really works for me, but I was surprised to see it as the centerpiece of a Summer blockbuster.  Between Scissorhands and Fear and Loathing, he always seemed to me at least as smart as the script, but in this case he pretty much soars above it and delivers his lines with a real relish for camp.The rest of the film was sorta okay, which is saying a lot since I generally loath the work of The House of Bruckheimer.  Like a lot of other 2.5 hour braindead epics, this one could have edited down for time.  It's not Bergman for heaven's sake - the characters beyond Depp's and Rush's (and theirs are all style) are almost cheap cardboard cutouts.  The advantage of stock characters is supposed to be economy.The story is excellent compared to general summer fair, especially in this summer plagued by stories ripped from comics, old TV shows, reality TV, and, in Bruckheimer's other Summer film, a bunch of cop show cliches mashed together.  It's not so complex a story that 2.5 hours is necessary.If producer Bruckheimer has a signature shot it's either 1) that much overused A-Team stunt explosion in the middle ground while a person is catapulted away from it in the fore, arms and legs kicking, or 2) special effect shots THAT NEVER END.  In almost any Bruckheimer film there is an effect or stunt that makes you say `wow' and you want to see it again, like the melting heads in Raiders of the Lost Arc once did.  With Bruckheimer you can count on seeing that effect over and over and over again during the course of the film until every drop of techno magic is drained.The shot of the undead pirates walking on the ocean floor was great.  It is exactly the sort of imaginative storytelling that has been lacking in many recent blockbuster films.",6,0,1,15 August 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," it's not even the good kind of stupid
","At least the Phantom Menace has the entertaining bit where Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson fight Darth Maul in a superbly choreographed saber battle.  AofC has some old dude fighting a weightless digital muppet.  And the rest of the saber battles were awful too.  It was mostly people in elaborate costumes striking poses while animation ran into their animated swords.The music almost rises to the level of a Bombay musical - every corny moment is scored with horns giving musical cues.  Overdone music is pretty standard for Lucas and Spielburg films, but this time it never frickin stopped!The acting is wooden when not awful.  The writing is deplorable.  I wish I could wish I hadn't ever wished to here what Darth Vader might have wished for when he was wishing on his wishes.  The pacing is as bad as the Phantom Menace.  Maybe I'm just spoiled, but special effects alone don't do it for me anymore.  I can see where the actors have reached the edge of the blue screen and it breaks the illusion every time for me.  I care less about how Vader became Vader than I would have ever thought possible.One especially dismaying thing is the number of action figures.  It used to be the case that you'd go by Toys R Us and say `wow, I can't believe they actually made an action figure of that shot where Han's shirt got ripped and he picked up the Falcon's doo-hickey energizer.'  Throughout AofC I kept noting how often characters changed outfits and how many utterly useless characters wandered into the frame and contributed nothing.  I don't begrudge Lucas his empire of molded plastic figures, but, for heaven's sake, there ought to be at least one character in these films worth caring about before he makes so much room for action figures.Ewan McGregor is a very cool Obi Wan.  Sucks that his character is stuck being a schoolmarm.",3,0,0,11 June 2002
Armageddon," a multimillion dollar blah movie
","spoilersThis movie is not action packed; it's slow and boring.  It's not funny or exciting, it's predictable and plays on cheap sentimentality and vague patriotism.  The special effects are not imaginative or impressive.  They are noisy and uninspired.The acting talent is wasted on hopelessly stupid one-liners and clichÃ©s. These are spouted by characters they ought to just be called `gentle giant black man,' `eccentric genius who is about to crack,' `square jawed hero coming of age,' `by-the-book coward,' `luckless gambler who lives by a code of honor,' `impulsive princess' and so on.And the writing!  How many undramatic countdowns did they think they could fit in this thing?  Does a scene where people have to defuse a bomb by cutting one or another wire even count as fiction anymore? The drama of the last 15 minutes of the movie depends on the audience caring if some jerk can put aside his personal differences with Ben Affleck and say bye bye to Liv Tyler in time TO SAVE THE EARTH.  All the work is done; we just have to wait a couple more seconds for Harry Stamper, the jerk, to toss off a few cotton candy lines.  I know Bruce Willis is a generally charismatic guy, but his Harry Stamper character is an obnoxious bore.  I thought he earned the Golden Razzy he was awarded for this role.Since the movie is so long, the plot so obvious, and the dialogue so disposable, one can't help but notice the lame inaccuracies, inconsistencies and plot holes.  800 feet into something the size of TX is less than a pinprick.  Try walking 800 feet into TX and see how close to the center you are.  After all the discussion about the artificial gravity on the Russian station, it appears to be arbitrary once inside.  Actually, gravity comes and goes throughout the movie.  Does it make any sense that anyone besides Michael Bay would give these morons a couple shuttles and send them to blow up an asteroid threatening the earth?The sentimental phone/insurance/cola commercial style montages were revolting.I do like action movies.  Really.  This one is boring, stupid and really stuck on itself.  It deserves hatred and scorn because it's everything Hollywood's most expensive efforts have become - a bunch of cheap cliches running from one expensive explosion to another.  Oh yes, the whole thing is permeated by a Neanderthal conservative outlook on sex, politics and so on.",3,53,97,18 March 2002
Ocean's Eleven," lightheaded heist
","I admire some of Soderbergh's films - The Limey especially.  I went into Ocean's 11 having heard that it wasn't much more than a celebrity parade dressed up with a heist plot and some nice camera work.  It probably should have ended with the homage to The Right Stuff where the gang seems to evaporate in front of the Vegas fountain.  Packing the expensive talent into a pointless epilogue drained most of the goodwill I had left for the film.Some of the things I hated were - the lighting of Julia Roberts in her first scene was Â… bad.  Why give her a mongo upper-lip shadow?  Farting away the whole `Pitt is mad at Clooney for making the job personal' with a single line was Â… okay I guess, since I really didn't care about the subplot at that point.  It's a good thing electronic components can just bounce back from an EMP.On the other hand, the script did stay ahead of any expectations I had as far as the particulars of the heist (which was kept vague anyway - when the film was over, I couldn't say where the vault was in relation to the casino floor or the surveillance room, whereas I could draw you a map of the heists in Rififi, Asphalt Jungle, Topkapi or The Red Circle).  I loved Eliot Gould. Andy Garcia was beamed in from a better movie - all of the other actors are winking at the camera and striking poses in their gloriously outlandish outfits.  I love and admire long takes, but I do occasionally get a caffeine kick out of editing that looks like it was snipped from footage taken by a swarm of bees.  With all the rumors around right now about remaking some of the most unique accomplishments in film history, I really appreciate the fact that Soderbergh decided to breath some life and style into what was a `meh' title.Ocean's is like People magazine getting stuffed into a decent Bond film. Nothing wrong with that.",Null,2,4,5 June 2003
Mulholland Drive," spoiler
","Probably the best movie of 2001 - which was a pretty amazing year if you frequented the kind of theaters that Muholland played at.  Somewhere buried in the first two pages of the IMDB user comments is a detailed explanation of the second half.  Put shortly, the deceptively smooth narrative of the first half is a dream.  The second half is the waking state, told in a series of lurching flashbacks from the moment that Naomi Watts character wakes up.  The events that happen in the narrative present tense are Betty waking, noticing the key and killing herself.  The rest of the second half tumbles back and forth in the real world, connect events and names to the first by following a kind of half-awake, dream logic.  Most of it coheres once you see that.  The first half is a twisted fantasy from an embittered and spent person and the second half is the semi-coherent recollection of the events that triggered her dream.I thought it was an awfully clever thing to do with a bunch of footage that couldn't find a proper home.Some people hate or are sick of Lynch's fiction - with its hints of unknowable plots, dramatic sexual passions, dark ladies and so on.  I really don't mind it myself.  The music, dialogue and images of this movie were clear in my mind for months after I first saw it. Naomi Watts is great in this film.",9,1,1,12 April 2002
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," love it
","I hate when people post `I love this movie.  It's the best film ever!! GREATEST OF ALL TIME!'  I find it unhelpful and it almost always indicates that the person posting hasn't seen very many truly classic movies.That said - JOHN CAMERON MITCHELL is the coolest guy ever and Hedwig is the best movie of alllll time!  All other movies that have music suck compared to this one!  I love Hedwig!  I love him so much that if he called me on a Saturday morning at 5am asking if I'd help him move, I'd be all `OH HELL YES!'  This movie is a 10 out of 10.  It's all the stars I've got to give! My god, my head is about to explode cuz this movie is soÃ‚â€¦  [SPLAT!  my head explodes].Just had to get that out.  Hedwig is mighty in every respect.  The whole movie revolves around a hero staggering from denial to knowledge, joy to pain, and pretty much every extreme you can name.  Mitchell is utterly convincing as Hedwig.  The art direction is often stunning - with things like a glam stage exploding out of the side of a trailer home and quivering cartoons that are very touching.  The music is perfect soundtrack to pour forth from a character that worshipped Bowie, Lou Reed and Ann Margaret. The only complaint I have is that the end went on about one song too long. I like this movie way too much to claim it's a classic of any sort.The DVD documentary is one of the best DVD extras I've ever seen.  Instead of replaying the movie, or dwelling on explaining certain scenes, the documentary explores the evolution of Hedwig from obnoxious club act to the stage and then to the screen.",10,0,1,5 June 2002
The Insider," An awfully well made film
","Excellent casting and distinctive directing.  Amazing appearances by Christopher Plummer, Colm Feore, Michael Gambon and Gina Gershon.  You wouldn't think music by Lisa Gerrard, Michael Mann's outrageous colors and Russell Crowe playing a man several decades older than he is would work together, but they do.  The story itself is not done as much justice as Bergman's Frontline piece gave it, but a lot of the important info is there. Wigand did a brave thing and the drama of the movie comes from his agonizing over why he did it, if it was worth it and how did he find the will to go through with it. Crowe's Wigand is a much more interesting accomplishment than Spacey's detached smartass in American Beauty. 
The extreme close-ups of peoples' faces got really old really fast though.",7,1,1,21 January 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," unique
","It's a unique experience in film history.  Visually it's almost unparalleled even after more than a generation where many of the most ambitious people working in film have done science fiction. This aspect of the film really has to be seen on the big screen, in 70mm. Every inch of the screen is packed with almost unbelievable amounts of detail and the illusions are flawless.  Kubrick was one of the masters of visual composition.It's arguable that 2001 makes the most spectacular use of music in cinema. The images backed by Strauss, Ligeti, and Richard Strauss leave an unforgettable impression on literally anyone who sees those sequences. The acting and sets are convincing.  It looks odd now in 2002 when most movies are celebrity vehicles, but the nondescript actors in this film ring true as apes, bureaucrats, and astronauts.  The space station, Discovery, African Savannah (which for some reason looks much better projected than it does on the DVD), and even Beyond the Infinite look right.  2001 is craftmanship of the highest level.The plot is a miraculous mix of documentary style recording and epic story telling.  At the most basic level, 2001 is science fiction about the evolution of life on earth.  The monolith and life on earth meet several times in the film, heralding a massive change in how life is lived. Simultaneously, Kubrick presents Life on Earth as a voyager in the pattern of Odysseus.  The tool using ape, Floyd, Bowman and the star child are representative of the human species moving through history and overcoming obstacles loosely reminiscent of the episodes of the Odyssey.  Kubrick uses 2001 to give a history of human life - from apes gnawing raw meat, to sucking liquid veggies, to eating TV dinners and finally on to fine dining. And one could go on listing the themes - man vs. machine, mind vs. body, the nature of identity, and Kubrick's awfully bleak satire on modern life.  I don't think any other film has ever tried to touch 2001 in its audacious attempt to absorb life and history into one plot.It's a film that demands visual literacy in a way few others do.  How many times do you see people (apes, then humans and HAL) sleeping, eating, arguing, killing, using tools reacting to a monolith or being killed?  Where do the eclipses occur and what changes?  Why does almost everyone look exactly the same?  What does it mean that all the technology looks like pieces of HAL and the Discovery?  Where does the orange/red color appear? Why does everyone spend time talking to or looking at TV screens?  2001 is a hall of mirrors once you see the patterns.2001 invites people to ask questions about its haunting images and explore their meanings.  It's a very demanding film.  It's dismaying to read all the posts here from people who were indignant that a movie expected them to figure out what it's up to.  That said, the 2001 experience is so unique that it stands pretty far from what a lot of us have come to think of as film.  There are no sympathetic characters by design, the pacing is almost that of a stroll through a museum, and it ends on a note of utter abstraction (how else to represent on the screen what Bowman has become?). In an age dominated by Spielburg's obvious and noisy sentimentality, Kubrick's 2001 can seem a lot like Antonioni on downers.",10,0,2,17 June 2002
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," entertaining
","For $8 million, this is a fricking monument of 1990's film.  The first time I saw it I laughed at most of the jokes and followed the plot with pleasure. That's more than I can say about any number of movies in the 1990's that cost ten times as much to make and starred pricey talent.  The editing is clever and cute.  The casting is just short of flawless.  Of the four principles, only Bacon seemed consistent to me.  The minor parts were sometimes spectacular, esp. Big & Little Chris and Barry the Baptist.There are some legitimate complaints about this movie.  The big one is that it doesn't really go anywhere or mean anything.  It seems like an awful lot of flash and talent to end up saying nothing about anything.  But umÂ… it's not like Lock, Stock is trying to be anything it isn't, so maybe it's not a valid critique after all.  Considering how long Tarrantino's influence has been around, it's a little unfair to call Ritchie on imitating him.  There are some similarities Â– large casts, distinct characters, clever dialogue, rapid shifts in narratives from one string to another and shifting in time, and few other things.  I think the problem is that years of dumbing down by Hollywood have almost eliminated all these things.  The influence is there certainly, but it would not seem as pronounced if there were any other hugely exposed filmmakers in recent memory that put as much emphasis on dialogue and character besides Tarantino.I haven't watched MTV since the mid-1980's, so the style of Lock Stock and Snatch didn't seem trite to me.  Some people I talked to said that the film style was too much like the average car commercial or pop video, which is getting the influence backwards, but I could see how those associations would spoil the experience.",6,12,16,21 January 2002
AmÃ©lie," At best, a fun film
","Amelie is an over-the-top exercise in style with a Hallmark card message. Be nice for the sake of being nice.  The last third of the film is much too long and predictable.  The film relies on zooming in on the cute smile of its lead so much that I found it annoying.  Still, I like Jeunet's use of colors.  It sucks for me that I keep going to his films looking for whatever Marc Caro has got that made Delicatessen and City of Lost Children so enthralling.But, it's an okay film.     Just    an    okay    film.  It's saccharine sweet, not profound.  It's a simple Disneyesque blast of sentimentality.  It goes against the very oddball spirit of the film to claim it's profound or enlightening.  I gotta admit, compared to A Beautiful Mind and Pearl Harbor, Amelie must look like revolutionary `genius' with its relative lack of tired formula.  But compared to the movies playing at the same theaters as Amelie in 2001, it was merely okay.  I'd put this in the same league as Run Lola Run - fun.  If MTV would go back to playing music videos again, people might stop overrating this sort of camerawork.",7,2,5,17 June 2002
