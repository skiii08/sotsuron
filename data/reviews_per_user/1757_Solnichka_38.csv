First Man," Nearly perfect in artistry and narrative
","This film won't be for everyone, but it's brilliantly constructed and delivered. The acting is nearly flawless, with the exception of Foy and Stoll. Both those actors really keep this production from actually being PERFECT. That being said, the flow and momentum of the film ensure you will never once glance at your watch wondering how long it's been since the start. The cinematography is beautiful, and the score is ethereal. Gosling shines in the role of the century, literally: Armstrong was a mystery to the masses, long after the moon landing, and Gosling delivers a moving performance that is so much the effort of physical presence. The supporting cast is mostly excellent, with the above exceptions. Familiar faces pop up as familiar names, and that makes the focus on Armstrong less obvious. This is a sentimental film, but more so in an individual way rather than a societal way. It's hard to imagine anyone under the age of 40 not liking this film, but it may not have the same resonance for a Millennial or a Gen Z viewer. Oh, and by the way, THEY LAND ON THE MOON AT THE END. Spoiler!!",10,0,2,1 November 2018
The New World," Same ol' Malick
","This film was just like _The Thin Red Line_ to me: beautiful, artistic, deep, insightful and a little too long. I love Malick's style; he doesn't do action or fluff. He gets to the heart of the humanity in his stories. The narrative voice-overs from multiple characters may seem abstract, but they reveal what is at stake. If 75% of our communication is non-verbal, these voice-overs help us truly understand what is on the screen. For example, Farrell's character doesn't talk much. But we know what he's thinking thanks to Malick's artistic style. If you like Malick, you will like this film. If you don't, well ... you just might think this is the worst movie ever made. Christian Bale is a little under-utilized, as is David Thewlis, but everyone can't get the juicy roles.",9,1,4,29 January 2006
Walk the Line," Phoenix should have won the Oscar, not Witherspoon
","It's amazing how good Joaquin Phoenix is in this film, and it's a darn shame he didn't win the Oscar for it. Sometimes, the Academy just screws up (see Cage winning in LEAVING LAS VEGAS instead of Shue, or Sarandon winning for DEAD MAN WALKING instead of Penn, for example). Reese Witherspoon handles herself just fine, and perhaps she was worthy of an Oscar, but Phoenix ... you cannot take your eyes off him when he's on screen. His voice, his body language ... everything about him screams CASH. The story is good, and the slice of time explored is perfect, in terms of conflict, challenge and survival. A very good film, no matter how times you see it. The only real flaw is Ginnifer Goodwin, who is somewhat miscast in her role as a shrewish wife. Parker Posey wasn't available?",9,1,1,6 July 2017
It," Too many changes from the book, but the casting/direction is fantastic
","First off, let's be clear. This was the best King source material EVER, and the TV version was a joke. This first-part attempt at the source material is infinitely better, from the casting to the direction to the production design, etc. It's a little odd to take the childhood setting from the late 1950s to the late 1980s, but whatever. The screenplay also shortchanges the backstory of the Mike Hanlon character, but whatever. There are some other changes which don't hurt the narrative, but readers of the book will wonder WHY they were made (i.e. Neiboldt Street house, etc.). And yes, for the readers of the novel, THAT SCENE is not included, either. Whatever. The screenplay does a good job with the child characters, allowing the child actors to shine in their roles (again, with the exception of the short-changed Mike Hanlon character here -- racism?!). The film looks good, cinematography- wise, and again, the production design is awesome even with the time shift to the 1980s. At times, though, it feels like you're watching STAND BY ME or CARRIE even. Was that intentional? Whatever. You should enjoy this movie, although the Pennywise demise is a little strange at the end, hollow as it should be. Too bad we have to wait so long for the second act.",8,3,10,10 September 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Best SW film since Empire and maybe the best one ever?
","Just stunning how good this film was, making Episode VII look like the lame film it was. Why? Two specific things: 1) Character development; and 2) Original narrative. The handful of main characters are very engaging, and the audience CARES about them, much more so than the cardboard cutouts from Episode VII. The narrative, while everyone knows the end game (for the most part), is lively and active, with no pacing problems whatsoever. It's not bogged down by bad dialogue from bad characters (Shut up, Finn! Go away, Poe!); instead, the unique characters and action sequences are refreshing, without any snark or condescending nods to the audience. The film pays its respects to the original trilogy, for sure, and the surprising CGI character presence of an old favorite was just awesome (no, not Darth Vader!). Overall, this was the best Star Wars film since Episode V, and it actually might be a better film. As a standalone entry in the canon, it's different, and that's not a bad thing. A few edits left promising moments from the teaser trailers on the cutting room floor, unfortunately, but this film was just stunning overall -- can't wait to see it again!",10,4,10,16 December 2016
The Hunger Games," As a stand-alone film, this is really good stuff
","Forget the sequels, which are cluttered and ridiculous. This first film is pretty good as a stand-alone story, and perhaps the author should have left it at that. Lawrence is very good at being vulnerable and defiant at the same time, and the visuals in the film are good at bringing Panem to life.The film is mostly exposition, as it has to explain so much to the viewers that haven't read the booksâ€”and that's fine. The actual 'Games' themselves don't take up much time in the film and are a little underwhelming. But as a 'kids' movie, perhaps it's best to limit the violence and gore, right?You actually care about these main characters, because the acting is well done. You invest in Jennifer Lawrence and even Woody Harrelson, so their fates matter to you in the end.As noted earlier, they should have stopped with the series right here, on artistic merit. Everything that follows is contrived, convoluted and disappointing.",8,2,5,13 December 2015
12 Angry Men," They just don't make them like this anymore, do they?
","This is one of the best films you'll ever see. Almost the entire film takes place in a small jury room, and the dialogue and plot are excellent nonetheless. What is reasonable doubt? Is it easy to condemn a man to death? These are just a few of the tough, not-easy-to-answer legal questions proposed in this film. Furthermore, what is the motivation of a jury? Do they want to be there? You'll recognize many of the actors, including a young Jack Klugman and a young Jack Warden. Lee J. Cobb is brilliant, and his passion as an actor once again shines in this performance. The film is in black-and-white, which heightens the tension of the situations. A viewing tip: watch the intricate nuances as the director captures the developing interpersonal relationships between jurors. It's one of the best aspects of the film.",10,0,1,11 March 2016
Brokeback Mountain," What was all the fuss about?
","The basis of this film is the relationship between two men, yet that relationship is not developed thoroughly at all. They spend a few nights together in the lonely mountains whole herding sheep. But why? Do they have some special bond? Barely. Do they share stories of their commonalities? Not really. One of them is drunk and cold, and lo and behold, he's now naked in the tent. If this was a movie about heterosexuals, it would be boring.The scenery is beautiful, and the film does a better job at developing the relationship later as life goes on, but the core of the story -- the beginning -- is really lacking in development. Pretty scenery and artistic film-making can only make up for so much lack of plot development. Considering it was drawn out from a short story, this is probably one of the difficulties in screen writing.This film would be much more realistic if the relationship was actually based on something tangible, but it's not. At the end, you do feel some pain for one of the main characters, so the movie does a decent job of bringing its audience into the characters' lives. But it could have been much better than it was, and a lot of people seem to be overlooking that fact.",6,1,23,1 October 2006
Juno," Mediocre film, at best
","The title character is just silly; it's the result of an adult pretending they are a teenager again, and assuming the teenager has all the knowledge the adult now has -- including a lexicon of snark that is totally inappropriate for the subject matter.I found myself laughing at the film instead of laughing with it, and if this is the kind of garbage that wins Academy Awards now, I might as well dust off my pen, too, and start writing trashy memoirs about serious moments in my childhood. Maybe I can take 2000s snark and apply it to my childhood memories of the 1970s, too! The acting is good, which is about all I can say for this film. I really just want the two hours back I wasted watching this trash. It's a shame the Velvet Underground licensed their 'Sticking With You' gem for this crappy movie ...",3,15,26,6 July 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," The least of the three ...
","I loved the first film; I really liked the second one. This third one? Eh.The plot is too convoluted; everyone seems to have a deal with everyone else, and there's little way to follow along -- except for the fact it all moves SO SLOWLY. The pace in this film was clearly lacking from the previous two (especially the first one); again, perhaps it was the convoluted plot with its intricacies.The humor was really missing from this film; the witty banter that marked the first so prominently and slightly dropped off in the second was demonstrably absent from this film. Two-thirds of the way through, I realized I just hadn't laughed much with this film at all.The conclusion was good -- ridiculous as expected, but good. The imagery of the two ships spiraling down while fighting for their lives was great. But it just took too much time and energy to get to that point. And what happened to Calypso? She just turned into crabs, brought some bad weather and disappeared? Not very good resolution in that storyline, considering all the play it got in the first parts of the film. Also, the deaths of Gov. Swan (off-screen?) and Adm. Norrington were disappointing since the deaths were so ... irrelevant. I mean, why even both including either one of them in the film's plot? The acting was fine; Depp was at his worst with his clones, however. Geoffrey Rush seemed to have a different accent than he did in the first film, and Calypso? You can barely understand a 'wort de iss sighing'. Lame! Overall, it was fun, but a little bit of a let down all things considered.",7,0,2,9 June 2007
Deadpool 2," Mediocre ... skip it, and you won't miss a thing
","This movie was really mediocre. Too much Deadpool and not enough of his co-stars. Seriously. If you're a teenage boy, maybe you'll like this. But otherwise, it's worse than the first film and basically devolves into silliness about five seconds into it. Save your money and watch it on cable later. The time-twist ending is just canned, as well. So predictable. And why cast Josh Brolin in ANOTHER Marvel role? That was just dumb. The best thing about this movie was the post-credit scenes of Deadpool using the time thing to erase his own big-screen past. When that's the best stuff in the whole movie, you know it's a dud.",5,1,3,3 June 2018
Spider-Man 3," Maybe the worst movie I have ever seen ...
","My wife and I were laughing AT this movie: the plot had no purpose until the last 1/3 of the film, the subplots meandered all over the place with no continuity or flow (probably the result of poor editing; the first hour felt like two hours!), and the inexplicable 'black goo' from the meteor was ridiculous. It was like that joke in 'Thank You for Smoking', where you can explain anything away with a bit of scientific dialogue: Dylan Baker's role was essential worthless, except for his two-bit contribution to the 'black goo' subplot ('It's a strange form of alien aggression!'). Do the producers think we're stupid? Evidently.Topher Grace was a disgrace; that character had no value whatsoever. At least the 'Sandman' subplot had substance; it may have been the only redeeming part of the movie. The woman who plays Parker's aunt is also worth every penny you pay to see her; however, she's not the focus of the plot, obviously. The love triangle of Franco, Dunst and Maguire was stale after the first movie; stretching into three movies just made me yawn. I mean, we can only grasp the fact 'MJ' sucks as an actor so many times, right? And what the hell was with that scene where MJ 'dumps' Peter in the park? That was never resolved in the movie's plot, even as Lil' Osborne dies. Was Peter just supposed to forget that ever happened? Evidently, the editors thought we'd be stupid enough to not notice that plot hole.The CG is not good for a movie of this stature; the Green Goblin Jr. scenes are just silly. The whole Parker-as-Travolta scenes are just cheesy; again, we were laughing AT the movie, not with it as I am sure the producers wished. All I can say is thank god we only paid $3.50 for our tickets to this horrible movie.",1,4,6,3 June 2007
The Hateful Eight," Eh ... Tarantino's been much better before this slop
","I didn't care much for Django, and this is another entry in Tarantino's catalogue that will not be in my favorites. First, it's too long; I fell asleep at some point in Chapter Two, I think. A lot of talk, minus the witty banter found in Pulp Fiction and other films by Q. Second, there's little point to the plot in the end, in truth. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I want didactic messaging from Tarantino (like in Kill Bills or Basterds). There's none to be found here. Third, there's little investment in these characters, because generally, they're not charismatic, really. That hurts viewership in a nearly three-hour movie. Audiences want to invest if they're spending that much time. None of this is to say the movie doesn't have its moments, however: It does. But there too few and too far in between the rest of the slop. And what was with the narration? Does Q think we're getting dumber and dumberer? I don't quite want the three hours of my life back, but I almost do.",6,1,7,17 January 2016
Closer," Ridiculous trash
","I want to preface by saying I walked out of this right before the scene with Natalie Portman doing the lap dance. I may be crazy, but even that wasn't enough to keep me in the theater.This movie is totally bereft of moral integrity. Like Mystic River, I guess this kind of crap attracts like-minded people. I liked the cast, but the story was disgusting and ridiculous. Why do I want to sit and watch dysfunctional people cheat on people they claim they love, etc.? I don't. It's not art; it's trash.I know I sound morally Republican, etc., but come on: Hollywood may have been dominated by cutesy little love stories for a long time, but that doesn't mean there has to be an equal onslaught about infidelity and whore-like slags.Thumbs down. Sorry, Natalie; you're hot and I adore you, but this movie is all wrong.",3,6,13,3 January 2005
Suicide Squad," Entertaining and good ... why all the negativity?
","I liked it. I know little to nothing about comic books, and I didn't see the last DC Comics film (Batman vs Superman or whatever), but the Wonder Woman film upcoming looks good. And, of course, I grew up watching the Superfriends in cartoon form back when in the 1970s.Anyway ... I liked the structure of the film, and it was entertaining without being over-the-top lame like some of the Ironman and Avengers films. I like Captain America and Thor movies, but anything with Ironman in it makes me gag. I am not partial to either comic canon; I just want to be entertained.And I was. Margot Robbie and Will Smith were good; Cara Delevingne or whatever her name is was pretty good, too. Clint Eastwood's kid? No. He sucks. And Ben Affleck still has no talent.There were only 10 other people in the matinÃ©e I saw today, and eight of them left before the mid-credits scene that is now a staple for these movies. It sets up the Justice League movie, I assume.Not sure why critics ripped this movie, nor do I care, because I have no stake in it either way. It was totally worth the $5 to see it today.That is all.",9,1,3,16 August 2016
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Entertaining but you'll both laugh AT and WITH it ...
","No script for a movie like this would ever satisfy everyone, and while there are some extremely cheesy/hokey moments in this movie, overall it's fun and a pretty sweet conclusion to the nine-part Skywalker saga. Some of the main characters of this trilogy are at their best in this one: Finn and Poe, for example, finally flesh out a bit more completely. The plot throws some curveballs, both dumb and intriguing at the same time. There's a lot of action that makes you wonder, 'Where was THAT in Episode I-VI?!' And there's a lot missing, too, that could have been inserted in terms of characters and storylines. But oh well ... don't expect high art, or you'll be disappointed. Enjoy it for what it is, and you'll go home with a smile.",8,2,13,20 December 2019
Divergent," Implausible characters and silly acting make this film unwatchable
","First, the film is nice to look at ... but it's just another 'plain Jane discovers she's special and the boys really like her!' movie disguised as some action-hero flick for teenage girls. So, it's 'Twilight' after the apocalypse, basically.Woodley is miscast; although she's pretty, couldn't the producers find an athletic woman to play an athletic role? Watching her 'run' is laughable ... it's like the actor never took a PE class in her entire life. How are we supposed to believe in the character when watching her run after train is the most laughable thing in the film?Beyond these issues, the film is just another stereotypical plot in a bottleâ€”it's not original or interesting. It's just another vision of the same thing we've seen time and time again. Theo James is cute, though; he's the best eye candy in the whole show.",5,0,1,13 December 2015
Spider-Man," Overrated!
","This movie was terrible. Why do moviegoers just jump on any bandwagon that comes along? The acting was credible in most places, but the special effects were poor, the plot was ridiculous and after all the hype, I expected more. A lot more.Willem Dafoe is such a great character actor; it was a shame to see him reduced to a cartoon character. Perhaps his best scenes were left on the cutting room floor in an effort to keep the film moving at a brisk pace for mindless droves, but I wonder ... Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are great fun to look at, and their performances are fine.I liked the back-story most: what happened to make Spiderman who he was. Growing up in the 1970s, I watched a lot of episodes of the cartoon series. I can't remember a single one, but I will always remember that little blue and red spider biting Peter Parker in this film. Excellent imagery!",6,0,0,8 June 2002
Dunkirk," Should have been a three-hour epic
","First, the event itself deserved more screen time and exposition. Only 107 minutes for this real-life story? Not enough time at all. Also, no explanation whatsoever of why the 'enemy' didn't press the advantage, which is a key element to the story. Second, the three-tiered narrative gets jumbled at the end, obviously on purpose, but it's not a good way to end the film. The out-of-sequence editing ruins the hitherto-positive effect of the trio of story lines, potentially confusing the audience. Those two things out of the way, this is a very good film: good acting, good writing, good cinematography, etc. The three story lines are woven well, demonstrating the different experiences at Dunkirk, and until the end of the film (as noted above), it's edited very smoothly and effectively. Definitely worth seeing -- but it could have been SO much better.",8,7,15,22 July 2017
Gandhi," Film gets better with viewer maturity ...
","I first saw this film in ninth grade world history; it was 1986, and I was 14 years old. Like I cared! However, after seeing it again last year as an adult -- and now having watched it a few more times as I teach concepts of civil disobedience to college students -- the film really stands out as a masterpiece of the modern biopic.Visually, it's stunning; the storytelling flows well, too. Some people might find it slow, but only if they're impatient. They should know themselves better than to watch this; they can get the condensed version on A&E Biography. The acting is superb, as every scene will highlight a different actor's abilities (many times, you will think 'I know that actor!'), all reflected off Ben Kingsley's own amazing performance. For a generation, his face *is* Gandhi's. That's how well he blends into the persona. Look for Bernard Hill is brief appearance; you know him from *Titanic* and *Lord of the Rings*. Look for a very young Daniel Day-Lewis -- his face is just sort of growing into adulthood.The film does take a time commitment; if you can't watch it in one sitting, don't bother. But from start to finish, you will see an amazing story of a person who should be a model for us all in this day and age. It's a sad commentary that he was murdered, and yet it's totally sensible in light of the modern-day religious zealotry that ruins our potential harmony.",10,3,8,4 July 2006
Jackie," Overrated performance from Portman, but good film overall
","JACKIE was slow but solid. Felt like Natalie Portman was channeling Marilyn Monroe in order to play the title role. Being born in the early 1970s, I never really saw Jackie Kennedy or her husband the way older people do, but as a historian, I appreciate their impact on the nation. But ... this was NOT an Oscar-worthy performance at all, IMHO, by Portman. She was mediocre, in truth. The rest of the cast was fantastic, though: Greta Gerwig kind of steals every scene she's in, and Peter Sarsgaard was good as RFK. John Hurt delivers the film's best lines, in truth, befitting his stature as an actor. Beth Grant and John Carroll Lynch did very well as the LBJs. The pacing was just unbearable, though, as the film just moves really slowly, and the editing was mediocre. The scenes are all jumbled out of order (purposefully?), and it takes away from the storytelling on an emotional level. A very interesting story, for sure, and it's certainly worth the 95 minutes it takes to watch. The historic aspect of the subject matter is undeniable, but the film itself could have been better.",7,0,1,21 February 2017
Legend," Narrative is all messed up, which is too bad
","By centering this film about an interesting pair of criminals around the Emily Browning character and her narrative, the film is boring, disjointed and uninteresting. Browning herself (and the character as written) basically ruin the film, as the writers attempted to 'modernize' a 50-year-old story with 'modern' gender perspectives. Why mess with history and ruin the tale? Hardy himself does well enough in the two roles, although the writing really doesn't make the audience care about Ronnie Kray that much. Perhaps that was an impossible task to begin with, of course. Reggie is the only character the audience cares about, and the story is focused enough on him, luckily. However, it should have been presented more from his POV, rather than his wife's. When her narration is edited poorly and ended abruptly with her suicide, the film just doesn't hold itself together well at all. Such as shame.",5,0,1,4 February 2016
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Better than Ep7, not as good as Rogue One, still too much ESB in it
","So, it was a fun ride. But come on, just like Ep7, they had to make it parallel Ep5 in too many ways: Hoth, Dagobah, space chase, ethnic scoundrel ... they all showed up in Ep8. On the other hand, there was enough originality here to make the film compelling, although at 2.5 hours, it's hard to not keep checking your watch after the first hour. Tips for Ep9: less Finn, less Poe, less Kylo, MORE REY. She and Rose steal this film, truly. Acting wise, maybe this is a minority opinion, but Adam Driver is just a waste of celluloid. He's cringeworthy every time he tries to act. It's a shame Carrie Fisher died, because it would have been nice to see her emerge in Ep9 with Rey and other strong female characters. Hope the Han Solo film is good next year.",8,0,2,18 December 2017
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Why did they bother?
","First, the original film in 1971 was so good, they didn't need to re-make it. If Hollywood can't develop any original ideas, they should just shut down. I mean, what next? A re-make of 'Titanic'? This film is weird. It's best redeeming characteristic is it is more faithful to the novel than the original film. I mean, Charlie actually has a father in this one! The backstories given by Grandpa Joe in the beginning are good, in this sense.However, the backstories given on Wonka's character are silly and just emphasize more emphatically the strange performance by Johnny Depp. He's one of my favorite actors, and perhaps one of the best of his generation, but this is not a good performance. It's odd, and it's not remotely engaging enough. It's cold, robotic and neurotic. Did Depp even read the book? Am I being too enamored of the old traditional story? In almost every way, this film falls short of the 1971 version: inferior acting, inferior music numbers, inferior plot. Watch it out of curiosity, but go rent the old version for a truly magical experience like the book offers.NOW, if they could just make a film version of 'Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator', that would be worth seeing ...",5,1,2,16 August 2006
Saw," Not sure why trash like this gets made ...
","It really does give people bad ideas, not to mention a built-in disposition for fearing their fellow man. I mean, seriously, who thinks crap like this up? And why are they not in an insane asylum? That being said, the plot was a bit contrived, and I felt it was kind of obvious what was going on -- no single person could be manipulating all of the scenarios presented. There were too many contradictions to find this plausible (let alone mysterious).The gore is typical; the direction was interesting. Perhaps the small budget made for the stop-action scenes for a car chase? It just took too long to get where it was going, and all the backstory information gave everything away. Movies like this make a living off foreshadowing, so the clever eye sees all.Will I bother see parts two and three? Not sure. Usually, the sequels just decline in quality, and since this isn't _The Godfather_-quality to begin with ...Don't bother with this one; the hype is all for naught.",5,1,2,24 October 2006
"McFarland, USA"," Formulaic yet perfect nonetheless
","Seriously, this movie busts out all the stereotypes, and it's still emotionally engaged and heartwarmingâ€”even after multiple viewings. Costner is in his element here, in a sports movie. He was always at his best in sports movies. The storyline is predictable, but you don't care when you watchâ€”because it's an awesome feel-good story. The visuals are good, and even though you know where the story is going, the acting is good enough to make you care about the charactersâ€”specifically the boys on the team and their families. Certain scenes will bring a tear to your eye every time you watch, and the movie doesn't lose its grip on you until the credits run.The only real negative is the actress playing the older daughter; the writers had to make her into a 21st-century teenager instead of the 1980s teenager she should have been. Writers do this to make the film more relatable to a modern audience, but ... yeah. She's too good at being a brat, just like she was on the Showtime series she was in ('Homeland').",10,1,1,12 January 2016
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Great Start to Series
","Okay, the first time I saw this film was in the theatre, and I hadn't read the book or anything. I fell asleep during the forest scenes, mostly because I was really tired.I write this review, now, almost eight years later and uncountable readings of all seven books under my belt. When I watch this film now, what strikes me most is the age of the actors: they are SO young! But in terms of the film, no one could have done a better job introducing audiences to Harry Potter's world. You don't need to read the book to know what's going on in the film; the exposition fairies are excellent throughout, and the wonderment of the Wizard world is clear for all of us.Characters are established, settings are imprinted in the minds of viewers, and the over-arching plot of the seven books gets off to a great start in this film.It's a little long, in an interesting paradox/twist: the first books were shorter and were extrapolated for longer films, while the later books were longer and chopped for their film versions.",10,0,1,15 July 2009
The Matrix Reloaded," Better with extensive viewing
","If you can cut through the hype, this movie is quite watchable. I found myself staring in disbelief at the screen for long periods of time. Talk about pseudo-intellectualism for the sake of pseudo-intellectualism. The philosophical tripe in this movie almost kills any momentum built through tradition and not-so-traditional avenues of film-making in a first viewing. While the further exploration of The Matrix is interesting to some degree, the grandiose strokes of artistic creativity are best appreciated after many viewings.The fight scenes are cool enough, but I often felt like I was watching a 12-year old kid playing a video game. The scene with 100 Smiths fighting Neo is very cool, but it looks like a video game. The first movie looked more 'real' than this (as do the animated shorts), and this film doesn't measure up in that sense. It's almost as if they missed by aiming too high. Commendable, but the end result is silly. I don't want to pay $10 to see a video game. The freeway scene towards the end of the film is also ridiculous, even if entertaining to watch. Again, the action scenes are not what make this movie great. Perhaps the most interesting scene is in Zion, when the crowd orgasmically dances after Morpheus' speech. But you find yourself distracted more by the nodes on Neo's and Trinity's bodies than by what's actually going on in their bed. Alas, this movie is not about sex (right ...); it's about The Matrix. And that's where the movie really clicks for the starving viewer.The best Matrix scene? When Neo meets the architect and more 'realities' of The Matrix itself become clear. Unfortunately, the scene is too short, too close to the end of the movie and too underdeveloped in the plot before the film ends, telling you it will be concluded in six months. I haven't been this disappointed since ... well, I don't remember. But after watching it again and again, it begins to satisfy -- even without a viewing of the third film.Target audience: teenage boys. Anyone else with half a brain should be slightly disappointed it took four years to make this garbage at first glance. But give it time, watch it again and see the beauty emerge.",10,0,0,23 May 2003
The Fountain," Don't believe the (negative) hype!
","I have read so many negative reviews of this film, and in the end, I'm simply left with the belief that all these people ... just ... didn't ... get ... it. Fine, so be it. I didn't get 'Memento', but because I didn't get it, I wouldn't dare trash the film.This film shines in almost every way -- it's simplistic in its vision, actually, but brought to life on screen, it's amazing. The images are amazing, the atmosphere created by the audio/visual synchronicity renders you speechless, and the interconnectivity of the three timelines is just about seamless. The soundtrack is stunning: rhythmic at times, orgasmic at others, all underlying the pain and urgency of the story. Love beats strong, literally.The acting is interesting: Rachel Weisz has her moments, and when she is in the middle timeline, she's at her physical worst. All the more so to emphasize her character, I suspect. As the Spanish Queen, she's just captivating. Hugh Jackman will always be Wolverine to most viewers, but his best efforts in this film are in the 26th century timeline, as the solitude of his character demands a top performance.One complaint: the film is almost too short -- 15 extra minutes of development would have helped. I wonder if there is a director's cut awaiting us on DVD?",10,0,1,5 December 2006
Steve Jobs," Another biopic about an American jerk, but it works
","I'm revising this review after a second viewing, as Jobs' personality is so repulsive, you can't help but be shocked by the content of the film. However, Sorkin's writing and the key actors in the film make this a very enjoyable examination of a modern 'god' ... even if you don't respect Jobs much for his egomaniacal personality that alienated so many people. The cinematography is excellent as is the accompanying music/soundtrack. All in all, it's a fine piece of art, with almost non-stop, engaging dialogue that makes you think far beyond the main character. The end is a tear- jerking conclusion that offers some hope for the main character's moral redemption.This belongs right up there with _The Social Network_, in truth, leaving us to wonder when the Google film from Sorkin's keyboard will arrive next to complete the Holy Trinity of Silicon Valley.",10,0,1,4 February 2016
It Chapter Two," Mediocre at best ... why??
","First question to ask is, 'Why did they have to change the book THAT much?' Ugh. Just silly, really, and hardly scary at all. The first film was better, and the ending to this one was completely unsatisfying. Were they suggesting that Richie was in love with Eddie his whole life? Don't hint at it, especially after that hate crime at the beginning of the film. Second, the movie totally steals from both THE THING (spidery head) and Ridley Scott's LEGEND (Meg Mucklebones? Really??) to create 'monsters' that were more laughable than anything else. Third, the whole attempt at mysticism via Native American ritual was just token and flimsy. Were the writers trying to make a statement? If so, they failed horribly. Finally, it was WAY too long, and sadly, most of the best scenes were the flashback scenes with the kids. Was Steve Carell unavailable for adult Eddie? Seemed like they were trying to replicate him. Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, and Bill Hader were solid, but the rest of the cast ... bleh. If you read the book as a teenager yourself when it came out in the 1980s, you have to see this for closure, but it's a really disappointing film. Prepare yourself.",6,0,0,10 September 2019
"Hail, Caesar!"," Almost unwatchable ... were the critics paid off??
","Seriously, this movie was terrible. Poorly edited, the story has next to no plot. It's all subplots, really, with no overarching purpose. The producers themselves basically gave up, as there's no sound in this movieâ€”literally, there will be minutes of silence on screen, like there's no situational soundtrack. Very odd. The actors save the movie, sort of: Hill and McDormand get one scene each, basically. Scarlett is barely in the film. There's a lot of Brolin, but that's about it. The best scene is the Tatum dance scene, and it's very hard to even think of a second scene in the movie that was actually good. The Ben Hur jokes are kind of funny if you get them, and Clooney is okay. But yeah, mostly you're just waiting for the film to end so you can leave. Since this movie wasn't released in Oscar season, you know it had to be less than stellar. But no one could have predicted such a train wreck of a story and overall movie. Don't both ever seeing this movie: IT IS TERRIBLE. To see critics giving it all these good grades defies logic. Great cast, terrible writing, because the cast actually has to have a purpose to make it a great film.",3,2,5,21 February 2016
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Entertaining but hardly 'the best film of the year'
","The acting in this movie is excellent; that being said, the story is good, too. It's a little different for those that can't think out of the box, but overall, it flows well and ends well. The main character is one viewers can connect with and sympathize with as the story unfolds.The film itself is unique with the long tracking shots and the small set of the St. James Theatre feeling very claustrophobic, but that enhances the story itself being told. The cast is not large, but it's effective right down to the moment where Andrea Riseborough and Naomi Watts make out backstage. It's not gratuitous; it's very believable. The existential aspects of the story aren't going to be for everyone, and that's where the film can lose half its potential viewers. But a willing suspension of disbelief is required to enjoy and value this film; that may not be possible for everyone.",8,1,4,13 December 2015
Straight Outta Compton," Eh ... movie just makes more noise than anything else
","I was a teenager in the 1980s, but I never heard any of this music until the early 2010s (unless you count 1992 Lollapalooza when I was forced to listen to Ice Cube?). While the film is interesting in its exploration of the culture surrounding N.W.A, it's also pretty inaccurate from what any common-sense viewer can discern by simply doing some research. But hey, that's what sells these days ... Jason Mitchell, however, steals this movie with his portrayal of Eazy-E, and that character was the most interesting of the film, truthfully. We all know they toned down Dre's character for some reason, and they overplayed Cube's character (to the point of annoyance, no less as he comes off as a huge jerk in this movie). But E was N.W.A, in all its gloryâ€”for better or for worse, and Mitchell really lights up the screen. I've read all the lawsuits that are flying around about the film's misrepresentation of people, and then I wonder why the filmmakers just couldn't tell the truth. Is it because the facts wouldn't sell? Is it because the facts don't meet the myths that people have been buying for years from Cube and Dre? Too bad Eazy-E died two decades ago, because I get the feeling he was the only *real* one of the bunch. Watch the movie for E, basically; the rest of it is kind of just trash. Thankfully, I didn't pay a dime to watch this film, and thankfully, I've never given a dime to Cube or Dre. But I'd give some money to talk to Eazy, that's for sure.",5,5,25,18 July 2016
Jojo Rabbit," Excellent movie and the best film of 2019, by far
","There is a certain charm to this film, despite the content that explores Nazi youth culture in a satirical way. The acting is fantastic from the young boy to the more-established stars in the film. No idea why Roman Griffin Davis was not nominated for an Oscar in the leading actor category. There are some Wes Anderson-type moments in the film, too, and that could make or break it for some viewers, of course, but those moments are brilliant. You will laugh with this film, and you will cry with it-at least twice. It's excellent commentary on modern political situations in the U.S., which probably hits too close to home for some conservatives. Highly recommend, as this film was better than _Parasite_ and way better than _1917_ in terms of its cinematic achievement.",10,1,1,21 February 2020
Midway," Very good movie, surprisingly so
","I didn't expect much when I went to see this movie on Veterans Day, but I was pleasantly surprised with the acting, the cinematography, and the screenplay. I'm a historian, albeit not a World War II one. Nonetheless, I'm well versed in the era, and the movie did a good job looking at real-life individuals as well as fictional ones as supporting characters in a great narrative. The balance to the storytelling was good, too, giving insight into the Japanese mindset of the time period. There is really only one scene-other than the bombing of Pearl Harbor, of course-where the audience truly can lose respect for the Japanese side of the story. That balance is key to making a good film these days. Who knew Dennis Quaid and Woody Harrelson still had it in them, either? Nicely done by the director to bring out those key performances. The cinematography of the air battles is pretty intense, putting the viewer right in the cockpit insanity of the situation. This is a longer movie, yet it never feels that way, because the screenplay/editing is pretty good. Highly recommend!",10,7,11,13 November 2019
Life," Just like ALIEN, but with a significant scientific dilemma
","The plot is really just an update of 'Alien', although the film is presented nicely for a 21st-century audience. The special effects are nice, but the characters are somewhat undeveloped, due to the short running time of the film. What's first and foremost is an idea that the 'Alien' series never touched upon until its fourth film. That drives the second part of this movie and makes it unique in terms of the 'Alien' concept. Rebecca Ferguson is somewhat wasted in this role, and Ryan Reynolds is wasted, too. So, what about the dilemma? In our scientific rush to find life beyond Earth, do we take enough precaution? Can we even pretend to understand life itself, on Earth or out in space? Unanswered questions, for sure, and perhaps the film could have explored them more deeply. That being said, the whole film is slightly underdeveloped (characterization, especially), and that is its biggest flaw. All in all, though, quite entertaining for a space-horror film. The first three deaths are particularly grizzly. Be warned.",8,2,8,30 March 2017
Alien: Covenant," Lack of character development and set up early in the film a major flaw
","Ridley Scott could have added 15 minutes of footage in the beginning of the film to make this a really good movie; instead, there barely any emotional connection to the characters (outside of David, of course), and what unfolds on the screen becomes ... trapped (?) ... in its own realm. That realm is still fun for any fan of the franchise, though, and that's why the film still scores a '9' here. But when you release a prologue online prior to the film, why isn't that included in the film? Not everyone watches online content, so put it in the movie. Same for the scenes with Dr. Shaw that were released online but not including in the theatrical version of the film. Why bother? As these characters inherently get picked off one by one by the alien(s), we just don't care about them at all. At least PROMETHEUS gave us some emotional connection to Shaw, but COVENANT gives us no emotional connection to anyone. We're just here to watch the aliens, and that's fine. But it could have been so much better with just a little more effort.",9,25,49,20 May 2017
