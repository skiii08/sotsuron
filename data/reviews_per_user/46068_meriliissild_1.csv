Hereditary," Disappointing
","I really enjoy good movies and especially a good horror, which I haven't seen lately.
I rated the movie with 1 star and it is for the cast.
I mean the acting was okay, but the storyline was a bit confusing and very slow at the beginning and did not get any better at the end.
At first I thought, this one is with ghosts and scary scenes but at the end it was with with some naked sick people in a secret sect, which didn't make any sense at the beginning.
The first thing I look up, before watching the movies, is how many stars it has and the trailer. If the trailer looks good, I usually don't watch it till the end, to make it more interesting. So I was very displeased and I didn't like the movie at all.
The beginning was extremely boring, and I had to fight with my thoughts, if I should leave the theater or should I keep watching. I did keep watching, because I already paid for it....
I've spent most of my teen years watching movies, so I allow myself to think that I know a bit about movies. Maybe not a lot, but a bit.. :) And I don't understand, how people can rate this one with 10 stars... HOW? 
I get it, it's a movie with a sick grandma, who was in a sect and had to sacrifice her family members, so that the KING inside her can go inside her grandson.. eemm okaaay. But why kill the girl.. So that the boy can be damaged and weak?? For what? And somehow the movie turned to be like an exorcism, and who was inside the mom and why didn't they dig the little girls body up.. I mean they could have use it as well... 
The movie made me question about everything.. some things didn't make any sense..
Not a good movie, not at all! Please don't waste your time to watch this, not worth it!This was my first review and I hope I will be better at this next time!
Thank you for taking time to read this!",1,2,6,4 July 2018
