Casablanca," 'Everybody comes to Rick's...'
","With good reason. This movie truly does have it all. Romance, drama, wit, class, and even a slight (or not-so-slight) dash of murder. If you like either Bogart, Bergman, or any of the excellent supporting cast, you've simply got to see Casablanca. It really is too bad about the lines, because most people under 20 are just bound to think they 'ripped it off' of other films. Patience, patience...   ; )",Null,0,0,5 March 1999
Liar Liar," Taking It A Little Too Seriously?
","This is a comedy. Not an intellectual film, but a comedy. This fact, along with Jim Carrey being the star, ought to clue you into this; Liar Liar is no Citizen Kane, and has no intention of trying to be so.

Singin' in the Rain," Sheer Perfection!
","This film isn't just the best musical ever, but also the best MOVIE. A definite highlight is the amazing Broadway Melody number with Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse. The first time I saw it  I was sort of reminded of the dance scene in The Mask with Jim Carrey and Cameron Diaz, but this one's way better. I recommend Singin' in the Rain whole-heartedly!",10,0,4,28 December 1998
