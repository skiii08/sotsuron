The Blair Witch Project," Scariest Movie in History
","This is one movie that should not be watched alone. Have someone with you, or you will be freaked out during almost every scene. I watched this a few days before I went camping. So scary that I remembered it as I was camping and wasn't able to sleep scared that someone, or something would come and shake my tent and I'd have to run for my life and wait till sunlight to go back. Whoops! Spoiler. Even if I was to tell you everything about it. Every single detail, and everything that happens, this movie would still make your blood go cold. Your heart would still be pounding in your chest. Do not show this to your kids if they are scare able. With scenes that will make you do-do in your pants, this movie is sure to be haunting the scary movies list for a long time.",Null,1,4,1 August 2011
The Alamo," A film worthy of an Oscar
","When I first saw this on DVD, I thought instantly this would get an Oscar nomination, at least. The music is powerful enough to make you cry. This, I believe was Carter Burwell at his best. There are some scenes that made me cry like a baby. Especially before the battle, where the defenders are writing letters to their loved ones. Plus, the end part where it's just Crockett, and five others including Bowie (who was sick, dying in bead). The acting is great, especially Thorton's. Why critics hate this film is beyond me. With a powerful soundtrack, you can see the scenes from the movie in your head as it's playing. This, in my opinion, is the best film about The Alamo ever and there will be no more made because of how accurate this one is!",Null,1,3,31 July 2011
Frozen," Instant Disney Classic
","At first the trailers made it seem like it would be another disappointing Disney movie. But after watching it, it is not like that at all...not even close. It feels like the Old Disney. The 'Lion King' and 'Little Mermaid' Disney. Great score and songs (although they shoved like 3 songs in the first 20 min. of the movie down your throat.) It is no Lion King however. No movie will ever come close. No much to complain about. Great characters and screenplay. One problem I had was the running length. 1 hr. and 43 min. was wayyyy to short for this movie. Had it been along the lines of 2-2 1/2 than it would've been much better. Overall good job Disney, and keep it up. Hopefully this is the start of another renaissance for Disney.",9,6,13,29 April 2014
