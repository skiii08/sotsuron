Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not a bad movie, but not worthy of the Star Wars name
","The main problem with this movie is the plot. It's pretty uninteresting. Only the story of Anakin is somewhat interesting, but hes way too young to do the things hes supposed to be capable of. He accidentally destroys a starship, yeah right. Also, why should we care for the planet of Naboo? JarJar Binks and his race are annoying. The pod race is the highlight of the movie.Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are good in their parts. The rest of the cast is more or less wooden though. The effects look too much like CGI, they don't look real. All in all it's not a bad movie, but not worthy to belong to the Star Wars saga.",6,0,5,27 December 2009
Zodiac," Pretty good if a tad long murder mystery
","I came into this movie with an open mind, since I didn't know anything about The Zodiac Killer in advance. After finishing the film the main thought I had: what's the point of having a 2Â½ h film over this, when there's no conclusion? Of course real events can't be changed thus the ending, but at least 45 minutes of this film could have been cut to save some of the meaningless plot points out. Actually it can be a pretty big bore unless you're really fascinated with the subject, as Fincher obviously was. I'm against the trend of movie starting to be longer and longer, often exceeding the two hour mark. A movie just has to have a lot of meat in it's bones to be that long.Then the good parts. There was no gratuitous violence, in fact only a few of the dozen or so murders was shown on screen. This is really refreshing with all these ultra violent movies these days. The movie making is solid, when you watch it you get the feeling of a quality movie. It ain't no Fight Club or Seven, as has probably been pointed out many times, but it's a good movie nonetheless. The acting by most people was excellent, especially Gyllenhaal, who I thought actually was the killer! Actually it would have been a much better movie if it was him, but again you can't change reality. The look of 70's was well present.What bugged me a little was the poor methods the investigators used in solving the case. Not once did I see the envelopes checked for prints (perhaps I missed it), or an attempt to trace the calls, or other similar tricks. Perhaps this is how it really was back then.",7,1,2,10 July 2007
Silent Hill," Very bad
","I've never played the Silent Hill games so I'm not a fanboy like most of the reviewers here seem to be. What maybe worked in a game certainly does not work in a movie. The so called plot of this movie makes no sense and it's also very boring. Why do little girls always represent evil in Japanese horror? This film isn't actually frightening at all, although it's supposed to be a horror movie.Video games in general have very poor story lines, they're just there as an excuse for the action. It's pretty clear with this film, when they try to convert a video game straight into a movie, it just doesn't work.Anyway a complete waste of time, avoid at all costs unless you're a fanboy of the games. Even Uwe Boll makes better movies.",2,1,3,13 August 2006
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Weak
","I really don't see why this got such a high rating. To me it was very average, and nearly bored me to death. There was not a single actually funny moment in this 2+ hours drag, just some slight chuckles here and there. Perhaps the movies of recent have gone so bad that people don't recognize what's actually good anymore.This film doesn't know if it wants to be a gross slapstick movie or a romantic comedy. Sadly it fails at both. Actually from the other reviews, i expected this to be a comedy with really gross humor, but there were none of that, just utter boredom. And this was the unrated version. Just one mildly sick joke involving a woman and a horse. The language used a lot of the F word, which is just a sad attempt to make it look 'funny' or gross.Only thing good was the ending, which had this pretty humorous dancing sequence. So to put it short, don't waste your time with this. Watch Airplane or some other actually funny comedy instead.",4,3,6,3 December 2005
Enchanted," Just mediocre
","I'm only writing this review because most people, including critics, seem to like this movie, and I'm just wondering why. The idea of the film is quite good, although far from original, this kind of themes have been dealt in numerous films. You'd think the script writers could pull off some really good laughs from the situation of a fairytale princess having to deal with reality, but sadly because this is a middle of the road Disney movie, it newer happens. There's not a single laugh in this film, unless you're very easily entertained.The songs are horrible, trying to mimic their 50s/60s counterparts, but failing. They only stick to your head because they're so bad. The number of plot holes is appalling, even though this is a fantasy film, I'd except at least some suspension of disbelief. How does the fat guy get to work as a cook not once but two times without any of the other staff noticing? Why does no one seem to find their costumes weird? What's with the squirrel, it was badly animated and not funny at all.Even though I hated the film, I've seen worse, but this just doesn't get above mediocrity.",5,8,17,1 March 2008
The Mist," A B-movie that actually works
","Good Stephen King movie adaptations are quite rare. I have not read the story this is based on, so can't comment on it. The story is far from original, it's the doomsday/apocalypse stuff all over again. But those, to me at least, are always interesting.At first this movie seemed almost like a made for TV one, with no known actors and a seemingly low budget. However, as time went by, the movie got better, which is quite rare. The special effects aren't necessarily top notch, but they do their job. Acting by most people was quite weak as well, except for Marcia Gay Harden.I liked the attack on religion, or religious zealots, as it's quite rare in an American movie. I think the movie wanted to have a big message(TM), but it sort of delivered it in this B-movie style. The characters aren't very deep, but I think the way the people reacted is pretty believable. Who knows how you would react in a situation like this? It's quite clear this was written in 1980, and the story would have needed some restructuring to be more believable. There wasn't a single computer in the store with Internet? No one desperately twiddling their mobile phones? The ending... well it's hard to say anything about it without spoiling, but it's certainly shocking. I'm a bit divided if I actually liked it or not. But it certainly ain't no Hollywood ending.This ain't a typical horror movie of today. There's some gore but not that much. There's virtually no 'jump' scares. It's quite refreshing actually. The scares are more in the psychological level. But I don't think anyone except the ones most easily scared will be scared by this flick.Anyway, the movie certainly surprised me in a good way.",7,0,2,7 March 2008
The Dark Knight," Overrated, just average
","The movie wasn't exactly bad but certainly doesn't belong in the top 250. I'm not a big fan of Nolan's view of Gotham City. Tim Burton made the city look very surreal in his two Batman movies, whereas Nolan wanted to make a very realistic and dull looking city.The film's biggest problem is the plot. The movie felt at least an hour longer than it actually was because of it. It has way too many characters and elements, and it's ultimately a long and boring mess. It doesn't even have a proper ending, it just hints at things to come. I also was longing for more action scenes. The movie only has like one slightly longer action scene, and even that isn't that great. There are smaller scenes here and there, but they are usually ruined by crappy editing, which doesn't allow you to see what's actually happening.The best part of the movie is Heath Ledger's Joker, even though the character suffers from poor development. We only learn that he had a difficult childhood and that's it. Ledger still manager to make him a very disturbing character.Don't believe the hype and make your own conclusion.",5,6,13,26 July 2008
Invictus," Uninteresting unless you like rugby or are South African
","Clint Eastwood has made a string of great movies this decade, but for me Invictus isn't one of them. I don't know anything rugby about nor do I care for it. I didn't know much about Nelson Mandela either, and after watching the movie I didn't learn much about him, as the movie isn't so much about Mandela than it is about rugby. Morgan Freeman is a good choice to play Mandela, but you can still feel he's acting as his accent isn't that genuine. Matt Damon is also in the movie, but his part is nothing significant. This time Eastwood isn't starring in his own film.You can skip this one unless you like rugby or you're South African.",6,1,6,25 December 2009
Pulp Fiction," Simply one of the best movies ever
","I'm not a huge Tarantino fan, I don't like his latter movies like Kill Bill's, but I must say this is one of the best movies ever. It works on so many levels. The dialogue is probably the best part of the movie, it's just incredibly well written and you will remember the quotes for a very long time. Then there's the plot, or the way that it's presented, which is non-linear. It works great here, although often a non-linear plot can be gimmicky. The acting is also top notch - John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson give probably their best performances of their careers. The music is also a vital part of the movie, although it's not necessarily my cup of tea, but it fits the movie. This movie just has everything - it's funny, violent, clever. I've seen it countless times already, but it's always fresh when you watch it. I know that Tarantino is not a true original, he basically borrows a lot from older movies, but he does it exceptionally well with Pulp Fiction.",10,1,4,22 August 2006
Back to the Future," Good, enjoyable feel good movie.
","Time travel is a difficult subject, but it's still used often in movies. Usually there's major plot holes, and there's some in this film too. But this is such a well-made movie that it's easy to forget the oddities in plot and just have a fun time. The character's in this movie are maybe it's major weakness, they are very one dimensional. But some characters, like Doc and Michael J. Fox's character Marty, are so good that it overcomes the weaknesses.The film was continued with two sequels, neither of which are as good as the first, but they're not bad either. As a kid, I was much more interested in the future than the past that this first film deals with, and thought the second film was better. But now looking at them objectively, it's clear that this first film is the best. Overall it's a very enjoyable trilogy.",8,0,1,22 August 2006
