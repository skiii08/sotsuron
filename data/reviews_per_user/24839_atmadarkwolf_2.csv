United 93," Good movie, touching, but with the evidence proving most of the events of 9/11 were 'staged' as a 'new pearl harbor' it is very hard to watch.
","I can't say if the events were true or false, but with all the evidence pointing toward the whole 9/11 'terroist' attack as being a 'self inflicted wound' to allow the Bush administration so much power, it feels like a black mark on the victims (all of them) lives.. as if they are only pawns in the greater scheme of things.With only the pentagon as proof of what did or did not happen, and with so many questions already around about what REALLY happened with the towers, and also the fact, or lack of fact, of the missing plane (flight 93 was never found? it, like the pentagon 'attack' was vaporized upon impact? -- the only 2 times in history a airplane was vaporized on impact, on the same day?) Sorry.. but if they had waited till the people knew one way or another, I could have seen this as something more than just a push for Bush.",1,14,44,23 June 2006
Transformers," Ugh...
","Sorry.. Was totally unimpressed.I think the only people who rated this higher than 3 were die hard transformer fanbois. I was totally unimpressed, thought the movie was 'good CGI' but thats about it.Acting was horrible, the dialog of the whole movie was just sad. The only saving grace was the CGI, but sorry, that doesn't impress me enough to rate it higher than 2.and now for the extra 3-4 lines of text that is needed, because I have to add random filler just to let the comment be added. I am sorry, but there just is not enough to say about the movie above what I already said without adding spoilers.",2,6,14,10 September 2007
