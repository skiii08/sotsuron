Iron Man 3," Incredibly Disappointing and Actually Quite Frustrating
","The Marvel Cinematic Universe. So far, it has been nothing short of spectacular. From Iron Man to the Avangers, all of these movies had nothing to hate and a lot to love for me as a long time Marvel fan.So what's going on here?When I wrote my gut reaction review on my blog, I was in pure HATE mode for this movie. Seeing the big 'twist' in this movie really stuck in my craw, and I'm pretty sure that came through in my words.In fact, just the Mandarin twist itself was enough to turn my feelings inside out for the whole movie, especially the end sequence. That was when I asked myself over and over again: THIS guy is the Mandarin?However, upon second viewing the movie has revealed itself to be not AS bad as I thought before. there is some quality acting here, especially by Downey, and Kingsley looked AND SOUNDED like a truly intimidating terrorist (pre reveal, anyway).However, I still think there was WAY too much comedy here. And not too mention the fact that many could have done without the kid sidekick thing, although it wasn't nearly as bad as it could have turned out.Still, I expected and really wanted to see Tony Stark versus the Mandarin, as the trailers promised. I was expecting something darker than the previous two. What I got was a buddy cop kid film with potentially awesome ideas that ended up getting screwed up.Are the rest of the Phase 2 movies going to be like this? Thor 2 looks promising, but then again, so did this one.",4,5,11,6 May 2013
Lucy," Gut Reaction Review: Lucy - Not sure I know what to think...
","This was a really weird film.This movie leaves me in a very weird place. One in which I don't know at all what to think of it. I went into it thinking it would be a fun revenge drama with super powers. Of course, I enjoyed Scarlett's portrayal of Natasha Romanov in the Marvel Studios films, so seeing her play a character similar to that in another movie would be an interesting experience. Which it was.Then why am I so hesitant to say I liked it or not?I had just as hard a time trying to figure out what the theme of the film was. Was it survival? Adaptation? Actually, the more I think about it, the more it seems to be humanity is just another animal. More on this later. What I liked:<ul><li>The opening scenes were great. This is the part where Johansson shines, and also where you get to see all the range she uses in this movie. Yup. Because it all disappears after that. I mean, it was perhaps necessary considering what the film was trying to do, but we get very little of the emotional human Lucy.</li></ul>Regardless, I felt she was very believable as an unknowing and terrified drug mule. A very good way to work up to a satisfying revenge movie climax. Which, unfortunately never happens.<ul><li>I really liked the film's use of cutaways to nature, animals, etc. At least at first. </li></ul>Maybe they went a little too long at parts. But when they were appropriate, like when she's being talked into doing the suitcase job, and we see the film cutaway to a mouse approaching a cheese-loaded mousetrap, they work to really to tie into the aforementioned theme of humans as animals.However I could have used less footage of animals mating and giving live, bloody, disgusting birth. That was quite unnecessary.Hey... I'm noticing what I like also ends up being something I don't like. Which leads me to...What I didn't like: - The entire premise. While this may be a movie-killer to some when it comes to the entire premise being flimsy, here it's just a minor annoyance with me. We all know that the whole 'humans only use X% of their brain capacity' thing has long been discarded. I've decided to kind of sort of let this one go because it's more useful to think of it as them setting the rules of their own universe, rather than actual hard science.And that's another thing... the science of this universe is really weird. I mean, she just KNOWS stuff even without having a chance to read anything. Is it just generating itself, knowledge I mean? Why is she falling apart? Why do the drugs help her when she takes more? How does she know what she can do before she does them?And it doesn't extend to the science aspects either... even just some basic human things as well... like, why is she able to walk all the way through a hospital without anyone trying to stop her? Why does Morgan Freeman believe her story right from the get go? Does her being able to video chat with him give him irrevocable proof? How so? Why does her mother show NO REACTION to her daughter's strange and presumably to her out-of-character ramblings about, 'feeling everything?' Wouldn't someone, especially a knowing the party girl Lucy was, kind of assume that this strange behavior is, I don't know, STRANGE? And perhaps even more important, if she is losing her humanity and the emotions that go with it, why is she (seemingly at first) out for revenge?Actually, the more I think about it, the more it seems to be on purpose. As the film goes on, the other characters become less and less able to help as she plows through henchman after henchman. This also then makes the idea of the answers to the above questions not making sense... well... make sense. After all, if you're left asking yourself about logic in a universe that is already pretty weird, maybe its like how the humans are less and less capable with relating to Lucy herself.Or maybe I'm just over-thinking things. Maybe it's that.<ul><li>The idea. While Mr. Besson (not only this film's writer/director but also that of Fifth Element, another weird film) may have thought this was a brand new idea, it's really been done before. Yeah, even something as wild as a human evolving into something higher than humanity and therefore becoming less and less relatable has been done on a number of Star Trek episodes and movies, and even with Dr. Manhattan in The Watchmen. And there's something about this idea that always turns me off. If I had known that what I thought was a fun revenge film would turn into a man becomes god story, I'd have probably not even have given it a chance.</li></ul><ul><li>The film has no conclusion. Sure, the whole Lucy turning into God thing happened, but it comes out of nowhere, considering where one thinks the film is initially going.</li></ul>Final Thoughts:For my gut reaction, I would have to say I liked it more than I didn't. The action was great (when we had it), and the opening scene was really strong. While having the premise of it's world be a disproved theory may have been a minor issue at first, the more I think about it, the more I think it was done on purpose to detach us from the world we are watching unfold on-screen. And it's a world I wouldn't mind seeing at least one more time to see if I still think the same way.",6,0,10,27 July 2014
