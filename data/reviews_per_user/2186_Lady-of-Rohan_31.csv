Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Volume 2 will answer all the questions and blow you away
","The Bride (Uma Thurman) was left for dead and woke up ticked off in Vol. one. After a bloody first struggle, the Bride now continues her bloodthirsty quest in the American South-West for her three remaining back stabbers: Budd, Elle, and most importantly, Bill. Through dust, blood, and the grave, she fights and bites her way to show her lack of mercy on the trio. However, before it ends, the Bride finds out some startling information on why she was almost killed and who is still alive after 4 long years.It's obviously very popular for the talk on whether which installment of the series is the best as we constantly hear this yammering on. For instance, Volume 1 is often referred to as the exciting one which entertains you to a startling extent. Volume 2 is commonly noted as the idle, less dramatic, and less interesting movie. Yes, this film is takes it's time more and the body count is surprisingly small but in my opinion, I enjoyed this one more mainly because Tarantino steps away from the fake blood and gets back to the bread and butter of a successful film; the story. In the words of Tarantino himself, 'Volume 1 is the questions, Volume 2 is the answers'. It's the drama, stupid!Anyways, what I really loved about this film in a nutshell is the story and the style in which it was told. Volume one was the Asian kung-fu bloodbath with bizarre scenery, great acting, and schizophrenic soundtrack. Volume two is the old fashioned Western where the story leads the advance and the lone Bride finally reaches her show down with her nemesis. Anything that was fuzzy, or unexplained in the first film is revealed in the Vol. 2 and told through Quentin Tarantino's marvelous storytelling and direction. The brilliant soundtrack also brings an authentic Spanish flavour to the stew, introducing all those high noon showdown themes from 70's spaghetti westerns that we all know and love. One of the best scenes in this film (and also one of my personal faves) is the fantastic fight between the Bride and Elle Driver. Want a rundown? Every glorious punch, kick, whip, smash, crash, poke, flush, splat, cut, and stomp all perfectly roar together to give probably the most satisfying duel I've ever seen on the silver screen. Here's how I'd describe it in a bizarre way; imagine two rabid wolverines who are high on angel dust fight to the death in a tiny enclosed room with wooden furniture. Brutal? Yes. Entertaining? Hell yeah!All in all, Kill Bill vol. 2 is a brilliant film whose soundtrack, story, direction, and action all collectively help to bring the film to a roaring success. It's definitely worth the twenty bucks for the DVD and I guarantee you it will be money well spent.",Null,6,14,9 October 2005
Casablanca," Play it again, Sam.
","Many film fads come and go but some movies will be around forever.  Among these films, Casablanca has an international reputation as being one of the best films of all time. Set in WWII, Rick (Humphry Bogart) manages a popular bar in Casablanca, Morocco after fleeing Paris when the Nazis invaded France.  But one day, he gets the shock of his life when his lover Ilsa returns.  She explains to him that while they had a fling in Paris, she was really engaged with her boyfriend, Viktor.  Rick now has a complicated choice to make: stay with Ilsa or send her to America with Viktor where she will escape the horror of the Nazis.Casablanca is a classic for a reason.

Finding Neverland," The story behind the story.
","Peter Pan has been a childhood classic for years but never before has it been told from this angle. Johnny Depp plays J.M.Barrie, a playwright desperate for some inspiration for a new play. He meets and forms a tight friendship with a widow (Kate Winslet) and her 4 boys who are struggling to keep their life in order. This friendship then gives Barrie the much needed inspiration for the idea of a lifetime.Johnny Depp arguably does his best performance to date and he is able to accomplish this without smashing plates, or giving a dramatic soliloquies. His performance is subtle and tender. And his hard work echoed in his Best Actor nomination last February. On the ladies side, Kate Winslet is absolutely lovely in this film. She's has grace and tragedy and by half way through the film, she has completely won over the audience's warmth and love. Glimpses of neverland itself are tear jerking. When you sit back, and watch the amazing beauty of a heaven like world dance in front of you, it's hard not to get choke back some mist. Despite the warm fluttery feeling I felt when leaving the theatre, I can't seem to give this film a 10. This is mainly due to pace but the music and gorgeous visuals keep the score at a solid eight.It's a gorgeous film with love, beauty, and imagination that shouldn't be missed.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," A great ride but with flashes of disappointing deja vu.
","'Dead Man's Chest' is one of my most anticipated films of the year. Ever since I saw the first one on a hot July day in 03, I was completely blown away. Well, three years later, 'POTC: Dead Man's Chest' has finally arrived into the hungry hands of pirate fans worldwide.To start off, 'Dead Man's Chest' stars all of the familiar faces we all know and love from the first installment. Orlando Bloom, Kiera Knightly, Jack Davenport, and all the rest are back in their usual roles. Johnny Depp, as the hilarious Captain Jack Sparrow, is once again comic dynamite and captures the audiences imagination brilliantly (by the way, he once again has a great entrance). Some of Johnny's best scenes involve him escaping in some way and because of that, the audience I was with was constantly laughing. For those who enjoyed the quirkiness of 'Curse of the Black Pearl', you'll definitely appreciate the 'non-serious' feel of this film. In fact, 'Dead Man's Chest' takes itself even less seriously than it predecessor. This is due to the over the top stunts, slap-stick comedy, and a plot which is even more supernatural than before. One of the problems that 'Dead Man's Chest' has is that it recycles a lot of the jokes from the first film. Thus, this installment feels like a bit of a retread, despite the fact that this film features an entirely different plot. The ending is a major cliffhanger and definitely builds immense excitement for the third film. 'Dead Man's Chest' purposely answered little questions about the plot (much to the frustration of the audience). Because it didn't answer a lot of questions, I'm not entirely raving this film. I'm well aware there is a third film after this but during a two and a half hour movie, audience's want answers to some of the burning questions in the plot. 'Dead Man's Chest' is silent on this issue. Overall, 'Dead Man's Chest' is an enjoyable, and decent romp but is a bit too over-the-top for it's own good. In my opinion, I preferred it's predecessor where the plot was much simpler and the laughs wonderfully original. If your a fan of Johnny Depp or Pirates, this is naturally a must see. I'm just not sure if it's entirely worth a second viewing at the theatre. 7/10",Null,0,2,6 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Pure joy to watch
","Pirates of the Caribbean is one of the best films of 2003 and is the best film of the summer.  It features all the perfect elements of a great film: romance, laughs, adventure, action, and walking skeletons. The pirate film genre has been sucsessfully brought back to life due to a great cast. Elizabeth Swan (Kiera Knightly) is the Govener's daughter in the Caribbean who found a cursed pirate medallion.  When pirates, led by the relentless Captain Barbossa (Geoffery Rush), kidnap Elizabeth in order to break a deadly curse, Will Turner the blacksmith (Orlando Bloom) and the hillarious Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) set out to rescue her.  Throghout the dangers of the high seas, there are planty of laughs, thrills and chills. The pirates have a frightening secret that can only be cured from the blood of the child of Bootstrap Bill.  Soon, everyone realizes whose blood must be spilt.Orlando, Geoffery, and Kiera make outstanding performances in this film but Johnny Depp is worth the video rental price alone.  He completly charmed the audience and made them laugh until tears came out of their eyes. If you love a hillarious, exciting adventure, Pirates is for you.5/5",Null,0,0,6 December 2003
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," A worthy family film that's a bit slow out of the gate but enchants both young and old...
","One of the most anticipated films of the year is the adaption of the beloved book by C.S. Lewis 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'. With a cinema filled of families and people of all ages (there were more adults than kids), I was very excited about enjoying a film that I had waited impatiently for weeks to see. Just to get the negatives out of the way, Narnia is a bit slow. The first 40 minutes crawl by at a snails pace and the lead up to the meeting of Mr. Tumnus and Lucy is dragged out too much. But when all four kids get through the wardrobe, the story really gets to picked up by likable characters (the beavers come to mind) and tense scenes with the White Witch.As for the positive notes, the scenery was top notch, with many people in the audience audibly playing 'Where in the country was this scene filmed?' The animation and special effects are brilliant as well. Most notably, Aslan, the lion saviour, is wonderfully animated and incredibly realistic. At times, you could just as well be looking at a real lion. Other effects of centaurs, fauns, griffins, beavers, and bull-headed monsters are also top notch.On an entirely different note, I really don't understand what all the fuss is about with the religious allegory. The symbolism is there for all to see including all the elements of sacrifice, and forgiveness, but it's not 'in your face' or distracts you from the rest of the story. If you enter the cinema seeking an allegory on Somebody's sacrifice, you'll be content with what you see. And if you plan seeing this film just as a family friendly holiday movie, you'll be content too.In all, Narnia deserves a worthy 7/10. It may be a bit slow out of the gate and outstay it's welcome length, but it's a worthy family film that enchants both young and old and transports you effectively into the land of Narnia.",Null,7,11,9 December 2005
The Notebook," The 'Ben-Hur' of 21st century tear-jerkers
","'The Notebook' is a story everyone in the world has heard a million times before; young Romeo-and-Juliet summer love which is tossed and turned continuously by opposing outside forces. We've read it a hundred times before we start the first chapter, know the conclusion before we see the end of the film, and can relate it to so many moments from the past relationships of our lives.But what makes this film different from others is one main thing; beauty.Never before have I been moved this emotionally by a romance. From the moment is starts, you get sucked right in. You're totally involved in in these characters and unlike many romantic films I've watched, you actually care about what happens. The love between Allie and Noah is so passionate and so vivid yet real and universal for any age. Any viewer will stay connected with the story for the film's length and will be moved long after the credits stop rolling.No matter how many times you've seen movies with the exact same plot, I promise you you'll appreciate every second of 'The Notebook'. I think the world could use a few more movies like this. It truly shows that love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and endures all things. Just beautiful.",Null,4,6,28 November 2005
Spice World," Oh c'mon! It's not THAT bad...
","I remember when I was first exposed to Spice Girls . It was my friend's 8th birthday party in, I believe, 1996. The party consisted of cake, presents, and a talent show. My friend entered in the contest sporting a curly wig doing the robot dance to 'Wannabe'. Needless to say, she got top scoresand won the contest. Since that day and 50 million records later, the Spice Girls hit their climax in the film 'Spice World'.Named after their sophomore album, Spice World has almost zero story line. Spice World includes everything from aliens, underground clubs, and PoshSpice driving a giant Union Jack double decker bus over Tower Bridge. It has some mindless yet memorable lines (the one about manta-rays comes to mind)and even features a cameo from Roger Moore.Love it or hate it, Spice World is on my list as one of my top cult faves ever. It's 1997 summarized in 90 minutes.",Null,2,3,10 October 2004
Finding Nemo," Get blown out of the water!
","I saw this film at a 9:40pm show about a good month after it's release date. I wasn't expecting anything spectacular but lo and behold Pixar completely blew me out of the water. Finding Nemo is a beautiful and gorgeous film about a clown fish desperate to look for his adventurous son, who has been captured from the ocean and put in a destist's office fish tank. The adventures along the way never stop Marlin's quest from being accomplished. It's a wonderful story on love, determination, and tenderness delivered with pure wit and magic. The film's visuals are Acadamy Award worthy. I went to Hawaii last Christmas and went snorkeling in a reef and I instantly thought of this film. Pixar animators captured the colour and life of a tropical reef wonderfully, alive with magic, and beauty. And not many films can do that. And the voices are top notch. Ellen Degeneres is side-splitting as the not-so-smart Dory. Other voices provided by Geoffrey Rush, William Dafoe, and Eric Bana are also nice touches.Whether you have children or you're a child at heart, Finding Nemo deserves to be bought and added to your DVD collection.",Null,1,4,27 March 2005
Troy," Good start to the summer movie season.
","Story-  Troy is the story of a love affair between the Prince of Troy (Bloom)and Helen of Sparta (Krueger).  Helen gives into her lust for Paris and the two run away to Troy to live together. When the enraged Spartan King finds out, he unleashes the largest war the world has ever seen to get Helen back.  Achilies (Pitt) is sent in to command the troops and to defeat the other Prince of Troy, Hector (Bana).Action-  The action in 'Troy' is top notch.  Swords clanging, arrows wizzing, people screaming, blood gushing.  Your local action nut will go for this film like a fly to a lightbulb.  The special effects are great and the eventful fall of Troy is beauty to withhold.  Eyecandy...I mean, actors-  Bloom is convincing yet neutral as Paris and does a good performance when he is sent to fight against a Spartan.   Hector played by Eric Bana, does his best performance to date.  Lastly, Pitt is tough and feiry as the legendary warrior Achilies.  His fight with Hector is very exciting and no stunt doubles were used in the fight.  Good job to both of you! Guys, feeling left out?  Don't worry.  Diane Kruger is stunning as Helen.Dialogue- Paris gets a hillarious, possibly unintensionally funny line that had me scratching my head.  When he and Helen are debating what they are going to do when the Spartans come to get her.  She suggests they run away and he gets into a long thing about how he can 'hunt rabbit and deer and live off the river'.  The audience was laughing and not sure what to make of this little line.  Overall- A great way to kick off the summer movie season.  The action is great and all of the performances are good.  Despite some lack of pace in places and some odd lines, Troy is worth your money.Grade-  B",Null,0,0,14 May 2004
Ed Wood," Sympathy for the devil of film-making
","In what is personally one of my favorite films of all time, director Tim Burton gives us the true story of the one often named the worst director of all time; Edward D Wood Jr (Johnny Depp). Passionate about film-making but incompetent at the skill, Ed frantically scurries around Hollywood with cap in hand to seek film companies willing to finance his dead-in-the-water productions. With the help of the down-and-out horror movie icon Bela Lugosi (brilliant performance by Martin Landau) and a reluctant team of showbiz misfits, Ed creates the cinematic anti-masterpieces of his own desire. Undaunted by the cutthroat criticism of the film industry, Ed stumbles on with his passion, door knocking for funds, facing rejection, tragedy, and heartbreak, all leading to the creation of his most infamous motion picture...Compelling, engaging, and frequently hilarious, 'Ed Wood' has an all-star cast providing brilliant performances from Johnny Depp, Martin Landau, Bill Murray, and others. By being filmed in black and white, the movie is able to accomplish the nostalgic effect that is critical in emphasizing the heart of the B-Movie era of the 1950s. One of the central questions which the film raises is if Ed Wood was truly the worst the directer of all time. Many understandably think so due to his incompetent directing skills, penniless budgets, and 'the-first-take-is-perfect' philosophy. However, with this film, it's almost impossible not to have sympathy for the devil of film-making. Ed really was passionate about film-making and really didn't care about the scathing reviews or cardboard sets, because, as he says in the film, 'movies are about the big picture'. To understand the hilarity of the film, I would personally recommend watching 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' and other Ed Wood films before enjoying this to truly appreciate the inside jokes. 'Ed Wood' really is a cinematic treat and is the best movie about the worst that cinema has to offer.10/10",Null,0,1,21 April 2007
The Day After Tomorrow," Pure 100% entertainment
","New York is up to it's neck in trouble. Los Angeles is in total mayhem. American residents flee to Mexico. And people stay inside waiting out the chaos burning tax law books. What's going on? Nope, it's not the morning of the 2004 American presidential election. It's the 'Day after Tomorrow', a movie of gigantic proportions.Day After Tomorrow follows the struggles and desperation of a group of people trapped in New York City from a major global climate shift due to global warming. America and indeed the entire Northern hemisphere are facing the worst challenges they'll ever face because the temperature is rappidly dropping and Western civilization is about to disappear under 15 feet of snow. The case for: The CGI in this film is darn right spectacular. The best example of this is LA being destroyed by a series of gigantic tornadoes. I was biting my fingernails with pure excitement in this sequence. It blew me away (uh, no pun intended). There were also some great scenes with some people freezing to death in seconds (eeew) and some entertaining scenes of peril. Jake Gylenhaal makes a thumbs up performance as Sam.The case against: Don't expect Tolstoy when renting this. Things freeze. Things blow up. Things blow away. The whole film is about showing off impressive CGI and a certain handsome young actor, not an Oscar-nomination for Best Screenplay or Best Actor. If you considder these things, I'll guarantee you'll have a fun time. I enjoyed it immensely and look forward to pop the popcorn and enjoy it again.Grade: 7/10",Null,1,2,30 October 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," When you have a screenplay by George Lucus, you know you're in trouble.
","When I was a kid, I grew up with George Lucus' classic Star Wars trilogy. To me, they are the grandfathers of all sci-fi films. Some scenes, dialogue, and characters are so groundbreaking and unique, they'll stay through your life forever. And now, as a young woman, I look at George's prequel trilogy and quote a solemn line from a wise king in one of my favorite films: 'How did it come to this?'Star Wars: Episode II follows our heroes throughout the galaxy 10 years after the death of Qui-Gon Gin in Episode I. Former Queen of Naboo Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) is being tracked by assassins. They hunt her down because of some separatist movement in the Republic. While under the very watchful eyes of her old friend Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christenson), Padme hides from her assassins and soon falls in love with Anakin. Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGreggor) is on the hunt for a notorious bounty hunter and discovers a secret clone army for the Republic. However, the face behind the dangerous separatist movement is still concealed. The Jedi are on a race against time before this mysterious aggressor unleashes his attack.Despite this long plot line that I have just given you, the storyline is incredibly thin. There will be moments in the film with nonsense dialogue and totally unnecessary scenes. And where there are needed scenes, the atmosphere is totally ruined by some of the most abysmal dialogue ever recorded. Hayden Christenson is the center of attention in this issue. His most painful offering is the scene where he confesses his love to Padme. This is how he casts his magic: 'I'm haunted by the kiss that you should never have given me. My heart is beating... hoping that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul, tormenting me...' Jeez. First Canada gives the world Celine Dion, Avril Lavigne, and now the worst actor of all time? It was better when we were known for beer and beavers.I'm keeping my hopes up for Episode III but after this, there's little hope of total redemption. Grade: C",Null,1,2,6 June 2004

The Matrix Revolutions," Weak and terribly dissapointing
","I'm not sure what to say about this film.  Words fail me, as with any other person who spent their hard earned money to see this film.  If I must be concise, I would say that this film was the most dissapointing of 2003.

After Trinity rescue Neo (big surprise), they head to the machine ridden earth's surface where Neo must confront and defeat evil once and for all.I have to say the Battle for Zion was cool but the Wachowski bros focused on it way too much.  Morpheus has almost no screen time and the dialogue is one of the poorest I've ever heard ('You can't die'/'Yes I can')Many hard core Matrix fans have questioned why this film is being hit hard by critics.  The reason?  It's not an enjoyable movie.  And the numbers don't lie.  Revolutions is struggling at the box office.Don't waste your hard earned greenback on this turkey.

Van Helsing goes to Transylvania with Carl the Friar to kill vampires. The problem is, the vampires look AWFUL. They have long brown hair with blue bodies that sprout dragon-like wings.The movie had some potential to be a good movie but the lack of horror left this project dead in the water.

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," An interesting take on the third installment in the Harry Potter saga
","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is my favourite of the books so far but right off the bat, I have some mixed feelings about the movie. There are some huge differences between this film and the previous installments and that's not necessarily for the best. Let's begin...Azkaban is considerably darker and more mature than the other two films. Every scene in this film is morbid and dreary with little or no humour. Rupurt Grint, normally the oddball comedian in the films, rarely gives the audience a chuckle. Not even the Great Hall gives off that warm light that normally shines during Harry, Ron, and Hermione's dinners. And judging from this, I think the box office numbers reflect that. The target audience for the Potter books is getting to that weird gangly age where they begin to lose interest in things (thankfully, I was well off the puberty train many moons ago). If the the HP crew want to keep the boulder moving, they need less talking and more action.But there are also some good things here. All the actor's voices have cracked (thank God) after passing that hunch of 13. There are fewer childish moments than in the previous films (that damn shrunken head still bothered me) but the maturity of the plot and cast keep this film afloat. The FX are not spectacular but are still quite good. But probably the best and least celebrated element of this film is the music. John William's goose-bump infused score, to me at least, is gorgeous. The music in the final scene with Sirius was actually quite beautiful. In some other thoughtful moments between Lupin and Harry, the film provides some lovely Celtic music. With myself having quite a strong Welsh background, the music actually made my day more enjoyable.All in all, if I had to compare, I'd be forced to say that 'Chamber of Secrets' is the best so far out of the series. Azkaban tries hard to be good but the slow pace and morbid tone keep the score at a worthy 7. It's still worth checking out but probably not worth buying.",Null,1,3,24 June 2005

Afterall, everyone roots for the underdog.'Seabiscuit' is more of a human story than a horse tale.  Charlse Howard, Tom Smith, and Red Pollard find each other after suffering through many losses.  They find hope in a little-horse-that-could that sparked America's imagination for years.  In 1938, it was an animal, not a human, who received the most news coverage in America.

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A spectacular, visual epic!
","Millions of movie-goers were shocked when Fellowship of the Rings came out in theatres December 2001.  It was hailed as a new level of fine filmmaking and lured more fans into the popular franchise.  By December 2002, The Two towers hit the screen and most were not dissapointed.What sets this film apart from it's preceder is that the stakes are higher, and the danger in the characters adventures is clearer.  Merry and Pippin are captured by the Uruk-Hai and meet up with the ents, Aragorn, legolas, and Gimli are on a hunt for them, and Frodo and Sam continue their way to Mt. Doom to destroy the One ring.  Many new colorful characters such as Grima, Gollum, Eowyn, and Theoden are introduced in this film and seem to be meeting most of the Tolkien Purist's standards.  The bloody Battle of Helms deep is one of the most spectacular battles ever filmed.  The reality is so believable that many viewers might feel that they are a Rohan soldier themselves.
One problem purists might have is the slight maipulation of the story. Chapters are missing, and some of the characters personalities are manipulated.  Regardless, this film has won amazing praise in both loving fans and critics as well as receiving two Acadamy Awards last March.Although this film does not quite beat 'Fellowship', it is still a spectacular, grand epic that will blow your mind.  Everyone, young or old, deserves to see this movie to enjoy its true greatness.

Garden State," One of the most original films I've ever seen.
","With big-budget blockbusters filling theatres with mindless sex, violence, and clichéd issues, rarely does a film along with a breath of fresh air. Have you ever seen a film so delightfully wonderful, you actually felt like a different person after watching it? If not, I suggest you watch Garden State, one of the best, most original film's I've seen this decade.What I love about this film is that it displays the late teenage-twentysomething crowd as real people. With myself in that age group, I often find it insulting that so many films portray us as sex crazed potheads, in trouble with the law, while disrespecting ourselves. Garden State tackles all those generalizations to the mud showing us that we're people who just want to know who the heck we are. It's all about finding out who you're supposed to be while living a confused life and facing your demons. All of this is brought to life in the film with great acting, a superb screenplay, and direction that can only be described as perfection. The film has immediately been put on my top 10 list for a good reason. I just hope Hollywood listens up because these are the kind of films people want to see.",Null,0,3,28 May 2005

One October afternoon, US soldiers are sent on a mission to retrieve two top luitenants of the warlord.  The mission was expected to go no longer than 30 minutes.   However, a Black Hawk helicopter is shot down and the mission spirals out of control.  For 16 hours, the soldiers are trapped in a relentless city.  Eighteen soldiers and over 1000 somalis loose their lives during the ordeal.    I thought this film was exciting, and amazingly realistic.  Josh Hartnet, Ewan McGregor, Tom Sizemore, Eric Bana, and others are terrific and bring the truth of a combat soldier to the screen.  Orlando Bloom is in this too. Girls, don't get too excited: he has a very minor role. 
This film is rated R for a reason so beware of horrific violence and graphic visuals.  Despite that, it's one of the best films of 2001 and is my top war recomendation for your DVD library.",Null,0,1,22 January 2004
Pulp Fiction," After watching Pulp Fiction, everything else will seem like bread and water...
","Often copied but never duplicated, Pulp Fiction was an absolute sensation when it came out in 1994. It became an audience favourite, received universal praise from critics, won the Best Film at the Cannes Film Festival, and made director Quintin Tarantino into a household name. How many films out there can you fit into this category?Pulp Fiction is so famous for several reasons. First off, it's one of the most original films of the 90's. When most movies out there are either remakes, sequels, based on books, or on actual events, Tarantino gives us 2-inch sirloin steak that's bloody as hell. The plot is several stories all interelated in someway or another that weave in and out over a period of about 48 hours (give or take and afternoon) all within the shifty comings and goings of the LA drug life. Each story connects the characters together, like a puzzle within a puzzle, and is all held together strongly with a fantastic cast (John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis) and Acadamy Award worthy performances.Secondly, it has tremendous dialogue. Quintin Tarantino is an absolute genius in crafting the film's Oscar winning screenplay. This isn't made up nonsense. This stuff is real. Many of the dialogue you could so easily overhear from the people talking behind you in the grocery line. They're conversations of reality, and this is what helps make the film so good. And when it has to be, the script is sharp as a razor blade in which Samuel L. Jackson deserves much praise for. Thirdly, it is amazingly memorable. Most movies would be lucky to have about 2 memorable scenes; Pulp Fiction has about nine. Mia Wallace and Vincent Vega's fantastic twist dance scene became of the most iconic scenes of the 90's (I will admit I tried a few moves in front of my bedroom mirror). Mia getting stabbed with a syringe makes everyone's knees knock and who doesn't laugh darkly at Winston Wolf's scenes. The acting, the story, the characters, everything just works. That's all as I can describe it.After watching Pulp Fiction, everything else will seem like bread and water. So don't be afraid to watch this wildly outrageous, fantastic, bloody, and often surreal film that turned the 90's upside down. It's all that and a bag of chips. Get out there and rent it.",Null,1,3,11 November 2005
The Da Vinci Code," Da Vinci doesn't da liver
","Oh dear. What happened?Phenomenally successful book turned into a big budget treasure hunt with absurd conspiracy stories that border on retarded.No, it really isn't that good, and my audience made that known. People leaving looked underwhelmed and confused. One guy yelled out to his mate on the other side of the hall, 'It ain't good, eh mate?'. He agreed. It doesn't take Robert Langdon to figure out that it's not a good sign when audience members complain audibly about the film the moment it ends.Cast wise, Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou make a great team but the absurd plot obviously kept them from reaching their full potential. It didn't help that they were being dictated by a wooden script that didn't even know what to do with itself. As being the blast of fresh air that he always is, Ian McKellen saves the film. His soothing deep voice was definitely comforting and helped to reassure me that the creators of this film wern't completely brain dead. His presence really is wonderful and I was so grateful to see a great actor grace the screen.On to bad things. The meaningless flashbacks really REALLY got on my nerves, especially how they just pop out of ordinary situations, and had that weird dreamy sense to them. The almost countless conspiracy theories of Opus Dei got so numerous I practically gave up 3/4 into the film. In the end, I gave up on trying to make sense of it and accepted it for being what it is: fiction. Overall, to put it in short terms, The Da Vinci Code is way too outrageous to be taken seriously. I want to like the film but it's just not going for me. Save your money this weekend and stay in with a rental and a curry.6/10",Null,10,23,19 May 2006
Love Actually," Hats off to the feel good movie of the year
","This movie just oozes love. And if your a hopeless romantic, like me, the film will be pure joy. It follows the love lives of many people in the hectic few weeks before Christmas whose lives are all somehow intertwined (kinda like Pulp Fiction but without the drugs). The stories focus on friendship, and romance in all its shapes and forms. Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, and Alan Rickman put on wonderful performances. A surprise cameo comes from Rowan Atkinson. He has less than 5 minutes of screen time but his scenes are hilarious.Love Actually is a terrific film. It doesn't have to be seen at just Christmas time, but all year round.Grade: A-",Null,0,2,11 June 2004
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Episode III is everything the two other prequels should have been.
","Well, folks. It's been almost 30 years since the first Star Wars film graced the screen and now it has finally ended. It started out with a bang and ends with a bang again. This is 'Revenge of the Sith'. Everything you've ever wanted to know about how Darth Vader came to power is explained in this vast improvement from Episodes I and II.One of the elements I liked the most about this film is that it tries to find out what makes a man evil. Anakin was never wholly evil. He was an unsure, young budding Jedi knight who was seeking for some answers. Palpatine slyly uncovered his insecurities and his fears and leading him into a lie that the Dark Side's philosophy of the force was the way to conquer those worries. It's with this deception that Anakin falls from grace and becomes Darth Vader. (Vader, just for education's sake, is Dutch for father)Acting and dialogue wise, it's step up from Lucas' two previous films. Everything simply seems to flow smoother. Hayden Christensen's performance is far more believable than his scenes in Attack of the Clones which were, at times, unwatchable. The dialogue is also a tad more polished but the clunky lines always seem to pop up at some inappropriate times. And yes, the talk is true with the final lightsabre fight between the Obi-Wan and his apprentice. The entire scene is brilliantly executed and tragic. John William's haunting score adds desperation to the sequence. I honestly didn't know Lucas had it in him.At the inevitable conclusion, there are no lose ends. Everything is tied up. You see what happens to Obi-Wan, Yoda, Darth Vader, the crumbled and destroyed Republic, and the Twins. I choked at the final scene. It was a fitting conclusion to a much loved series, and perfectly connects to the original trilogy Lucas composed all those years ago.All in all, Episode III is the best and most enjoyable of the prequel films. The whole theatre enjoyed it from start to finish and I am glad I took the time to appreciate a good series, despite it's flaws.",Null,2,6,20 May 2005
Carrie," Creepy
","Carrie is based on the classic horror story by Stephen King.  It tells the tale of an abused, outcasted teenager with two secrets: her religious fanatic mother and Carrie's power of telekenisis. On prom night, she gets pushed way too far and unleashes her powers on the school. Carrie is a pretty good film despite the lack of horror.  The very end made me jump the most.  Yikes! See Carrie if you want an entertaining scare on a Saturday night.7/10",Null,0,0,2 January 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The best of the three
","Return of the King is the most anticipated movie of 2003 and has not let audiences down.  It's a rich and masterful collaberation of amazing visual effects, wonderful acting, superior story, and sweeping emotion. 
Frodo, Sam, and Gollum make their final stage to Mt. Doom to destroy the One Ring, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli summon a cursed army within a mountain, Merry joins the Rohirrim cavalry, Pippin becomes a soldier of Gondor, and all people unite to fight the evil forces at the Battle of the Pellenor Fields.  This battle is by far the most spectacular battle scene ever filmed.  100,000 orcs storm the city of Minas Tirith with super-trolls, wargs, Fells Beasts, and Oliphaunts.  A wonderful part of the film is when Pippin says to the wizard, Gandalf that he is scared to die.  Gandalf comforts him is saying what happens in the afterlife, how there is no more pain, and that the land appears with a quick sunrise.  The film is very long at 3 1/4 hours so I warn you to not drink anything before hand.  However, it will feel like the fastest 3 hours in your life and you will want to see it again and again.  However, if you are just being introduced into this story, please see the first two films or you will be totally and utterly lost.Return of the King is the best film of the year and is sure to be a crowning favourite.",Null,0,0,21 December 2003
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A cinematic classic that I will treasure forever
","What can I say right now that hasn't been celebrated a million times before? I grew up with these films when I was young, building my childhood full of memories of wookies, stormtroopers, and fighting my younger brother with wrapping paper tubes to create our own lightsaber fights. This film is nothing less than a cinematic triumph with scenes, characters, and music that have practically revolutionized the way we look at the movies. Who on this good earth doesn't feel a rush of excitement to see that Star Wars logo on screen which sweeps into the distance with that oh so hummable theme?Even over 25 years later the story is still as enjoyable and original as it was way back in the 70's. It deserves a rightful place in your DVD library.",Null,0,1,28 April 2005
Donnie Darko," My God, we need more films like this. Brilliant!
","Wow. I just finished this right now on Halloween night and I'm blown away. Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a depressed troubled teen who has disturbing visions from Frank, a man in a bunny outfit. He tells Donnie that the world is going to end in 28 days and tells him time travel is possible. Throughout the month of October until 'the end of the world', Donnie struggles with his visions from Frank and gains knowledge on time travel and the pursuit to happiness and the separation of love and fear.The movie is a total breath of fresh air from the recycled crud the theaters are currently running. The plot challenges the audience to push themselves beyond their limits of understanding things. The movie doesn't focus on being scary, such as someone sneaking behind someone and crashing cymbals behind their head, but instead centres around the disturbing thoughts, and reactions that Donnie goes throw. Jake Gyllenhaal was absolutely incredible in this film. His performance was radical and totally believable. By the way, was he nominated for an Oscar for this one?If not, he damn well deserved one.Donnie Darko is dark, challenging, and undoubtedly brilliant. An instant cult classic. I loved it.10/10",Null,0,1,31 October 2004
