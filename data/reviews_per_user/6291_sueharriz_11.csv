It," TOO MANY F WORDS BY YOUNG KIDS
",I was severely put off by the many use of the F word and how vulgar some of them can be.,6,1,3,3 February 2018
Hereditary," GIVE ME BACK MY 2 HOURS
","This movie is PAINFUL to watch, agonizing, a slow burn. the ending was extremely stupid, too stupid to even be made into animation movies for kids. i was fooled by the reviews here!!!!!",1,1,4,22 September 2018
Oldboy," not bad
",I still prefer I Saw The Devil. this movie is not as gory as I Saw The Devil. i developed a severe migraine after watching this coz there are multiple plot twist and requires the audience TO THINK.,8,1,4,20 August 2018
Aquaman," NOT BAD
",The cinematography is excellent. my kids enjoyed it. the storyline is not boring but not top notch either,7,2,4,20 December 2018
Bird Box," enjoyable!
",I have watched it yesterday and i feel i prefer The Mist more. the only drawback that makes me go erghh is that brief making love part (where 2 characters were seen naked) so my kids cant watch this movie.,8,5,8,30 December 2018
A Quiet Place," STUNNING!
","All other horror movies are about creatures/aliens that can detect movements or scents, but this one, is simply exceptional, coz its about creatures that are sensitive to sounds! i was watching this movie in the cinema and oh boy, the cinema was very quiet. i love this movie. totally recommend!!! if you love watchinf Dont Breathe or Hush, u will enjoy this one ..imho, a movie that can make me feel scared, anxious and teary eyed at the same time is definitely worth watching!",9,3,7,13 May 2018
Coco," i didnt expect this from an animation movie...
","Me and my 2 kids were feeling bored one night, then i decided to let them watch Coco. the 1st 10 minutes into the movie, i wasnt really watching though my kids were so into it. but then....as the story got deeper..i also got sucked in...the twist of plot about Hector, was an eye opener. the song he sang for Coco got all of us teary eyed! now i cant listen to the song Remember Me without being sad. such an amazing movie, i could watch it again and again. BRAVO!",10,0,1,7 February 2018
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," wanted to like it...but...
",It's slow and very confusing....got me spinning off here and there...couldnt even finish watching it... i dont understand the high ratings though...,2,1,8,2 March 2019
The Shape of Water," OVERHYPED
","SHAPE OF WATER : 2/10 .This movie is an Oscar winner~but it doesnt impress me much. Im pretty sure my kids wouldve enjoyed it, if not for some nude scenes (not to mention one very clear humping thumping on bed -butt in your face -scene), i wouldve let my kids watch it together with me. The plot is pretty easy to understand, mainly about the mute woman and the amphibian creature. No mystery, no plot twist. Cinderella-like kinda? ~ her shoe slipped out of her foot as they kissed, lol. Will i watch it again? Nope.
because this was the work of Guillermo Del Toro, it feels like it deserves to win?the Oscars?
what if some indie underground producers came out with this movie, would it even make it to the Oscars? i dont think so.",2,28,59,14 April 2018
Joker," Probably one of the best movies in 2019
","I dont want to say much, but after watching the movie in cinema, i still cant shake the thoughts about Joker off my mind. I even watch the trailers everyday, it's something very moving about the movie. It moved me.
I have never felt this much compassion and deep sorrow and empathy towards ANY villain in any other movies.
This movie deserves MANY WINS.",10,1,1,7 October 2019
Parasite," I WAS EXPECTING A 10 STARS MOVIE
","Many plot holes, illogical scenes at times...
i was hoping for a better plot twist, to be honest..",7,9,19,5 November 2019
