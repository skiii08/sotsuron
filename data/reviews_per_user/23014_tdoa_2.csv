The King's Speech," regardless of our feelings about the monarchy .....
",".... can we not just enjoy this film as a great character driven drama with great acting and sharp, witty dialog !!!! As a Canadian I'm all for keeping the monarchy where it belongs, in the UK, and let them deal with it however they please. But because we are part of the commonwealth, the queen is considered our head of state and billions of taxpayers dollars are wasted to support the governor general as her representative in our country and a lieutenant governor for each province + all the royal visits we have to contend with. So do away with them I say (in a non-violent way of course). Unfortunately, like in Australia not too long ago, if a referendum were to be held, most would vote to hang on to them.Having said that, for me this is the best movie I've seen this year. Immensely enjoyable and engaging on all emotional levels as a story of human beings, royal or not, dealing with hardships of sorts and overcoming them. Acted to perfection by each cast member, with dialog that was smart, literate, funny and moving.Start preparing your speech for that Oscar, Colin (and any other actor in this film to be nominated) !!!! In conclusion: down with the monarchy, up with The King's Speech !!!!P.S. After reading up on the Windsors, what would make a really interesting movie is about his brother Prince George the duke of Kent: reputedly a bi-sexual, drug addict who was possibly murdered by the higher ups during WWII because of his nazi sympathies.",10,1,2,15 December 2010
Beauty and the Beast," So much negativity, not that my opinion is more important, but ....
","Whether you argue that Disney has run out of creative ideas or not this movie was totally enchanting and also a feast for the eyes with great SFX. Not a fan of the bombastic show tunes that musicals tend to nowadays, but I could live with it. Biggest surprise is what a great singing voice Luke Evans has. Get that man into a musical soon. Emma Watson sounded a lot like Anna Kendrick, but it seems she did her own singing.",7,2,7,26 March 2017
