The King's Speech," Best actor for Colin Firth so well deserved.
","Even if the rest of the components to this movie were below average (other actors, dialog, filming, story, etc.) the exceptional work that Colin Firth did would raise this movie to above average. However, other parts were better than average. I found the movie to flow at a very graceful pace, capturing the essence that was necessary as well as adding elements of the times and atmosphere. Geoffrey Rush carried out his role in exquisite fashion. Surely a 'normal', run of the mill, speech therapist wouldn't have gotten the attention of the new king and his wife. He needed to be something unique and special, Rush carried this out to perfection. I most definitely will watch this one again. I don't usually do that!",9,0,0,20 April 2011
