Skyfall," disappointing
","truth is, skyfall isn't a bad movie. in fact its probably a decent action flick, but sadly it simply isn't a james bond movie! it tries. the writers try to go back to the basics with the gadgets and weapons, and the theme song is great, enough that i dared hope that this one will be a fine addition to the series, unlike the previous 'craigs'. as the movie unfolds however, it appears that its just the opposite. the dialogs are as weak and as 'un-bondlike' as before and the plot is full of holes and yet somehow very predictable. above all else though, is the story. sure, the movie is packed with gunfights and the occasional car chase but the story itself isn't working! where is the evil mastermind with the clever disguise, where is the clever banter when the world hangs on the balance, where is the save at the last minute and the unfazed bond with the girl under his arm afterward? 007 is a spy not rambo! where's the subterfuge? there are better bond movies than others but when you watch one there are certain things you expect regardless and skyfall is the first one to break that rule. that's why in my opinion, while the two previous ones 'only' wherent very good, skyfall is worse, as its not a bond movie at all!",5,5,12,2 March 2013
