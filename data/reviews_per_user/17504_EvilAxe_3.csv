Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," THE funniest and most genius comedy in the history of film
","It's gonna take a lot to ever top Borat as a comedy. It is a masterpiece. Having seen countless films in the past 30 years with all sorts of comedies, Borat is the icing on the cake.Sure, there are a few other truly funny comedies out there. There are some OK ones. And there is a lot (and I mean a lot) of really bad and overrated ones ('The Hangover' for instance).Borat came out of nowhere without too much unneeded hype and expectation. It took the world by surprise and wasn't marketed ahead of time with talk show appearances of cast and crew (which is the common norm these days with the cookie-cutter wannabe-comedies).Borat may seem like a somewhat childish movie at first, but watch it again - and you will start seeing it work on many levels. It takes great intelligence to create truly funny comedy that lasts a lifetime. Anyone can make slapstick or fart jokes and get a few laughs there and then. But to create something that sticks to people's minds for years, to be quoted and imitated, to have catch phrases and social lingo left as its legacy - that takes effort!This movie accomplishes all that. It's one of those few gems that gets funnier and funnier for every time you see it. It feels good to laugh so long and hard that you're almost tired. Like, your stomach muscles got a healthy workout. And you feel better afterwards. Just like after a good day in the gym.Borat sure delivers. People who rate this movie low are either: A) way too sensitive about 'provocative' subject matters B) brought up to think only cookie-cutter 'accepted' commercial comedies are funny C) not understanding the hilarity in how humans behave when placed in awkward situations with an awkward man that they really don't know how to handle D) all of the above.Cheers to Borat - the funniest comedy ever made.",10,0,4,20 February 2010
Split," Split is Sh*t. Absolute waste of 2 hours.
","With time being our most precious commodity, I try to carefully select the movies I do watch, as I don't have a ton of time to watch them. But the hype around this movie, and of course the (mind boggling) 7.4 IMDb rating tempted me enough to give it a chance. I sat down excited with my favorite snacks - hoping to be in for what some called 'one of the best horror movies this year so far'.Wow.... really? Horror? This is NOT horror. It's a suspense thriller / drama at best. This movie couldn't even scare a 12 year old. And THIS is supposed to be the 'return of M Night Shyamalan'? What? I absolutely loved Signs, and The Sixth Sense is amazing too. But his movies since have gone down hill. The Visit was very lackluster and pretty disappointing too. But not as disappointing as this stinker. At least with The Visit - there was no claims or hype saying this was his 'return to form' so I didn't expect a lot. But Split? This is more like a terribly executed amateur film students idea of a 'thriller'. The first 20-30 minutes, the movie has your interest a little bit as you wonder about the kinds of twists and surprises you are about to treated to. Maybe the guy is a ghost? Maybe there are actually more than one main protagonist? Maybe the girls are in an alternate reality? Maybe there is an actual, physical, hairy (as they describe him) monster that we will soon get to see? Oh man...that would be cool.. These are things I was eagerly thinking as I was watching, hoping I would be right, and that if so - these plot twists could turn this how I would have written if it I was behind it.But nope. As time goes on, you realize, there is NOTHING exciting happening. Just some incredibly boring dialogues, a character study of multiple personality disorder, some dumb girls trying to escape, and several conversations between a shrink and her patient. *Yawn* The ending? I was half asleep at that point but it was extremely underwhelming and disappointing. So the 'beast' just looks like the dude, just with some veins popping out, and he can climb walls? Wow, amazing. Not.Save your time and do not listen to the positive reviewers. I think they were paid by Universal Studios to bring up the overall score here.",1,69,165,3 May 2017
The Cabin in the Woods," For true horror fans - Stay away from this stinker....
","Wow, it's not often that you see a horror movie with such a high rating on IMDb. And that is what got me so excited to see it. Even the best horror movies I have ever seen usually get an average rating of around 5 or 6 here, so this one with a 7+ rating HAD to be simply amazing, right?WRONG...I consider myself a horror buff, having seen countless movies in the past 25 years. But this movie flat out sucked. I don't care if it's supposed to be some 'intelligent' satire, or a 'spoof on the horror genre'. It fails at being a satire, and it fails at being horror. If anything, this is more of an action movie with effects. Not a horror movie!There are a couple of gory scenes, and the make-up and effects are good. I imagine a large portion of the budget went into making the CGI effects. And I'm all for good effects and gore. But when the movie - as a movie, doesn't hold up at all, then it's all a waste. Most movies with an effects / gore budget lower than this one are also way better movies - because they do what a horror movie is supposed to do; That is, keep you on your toes, feel unpredictable, feel scary, feel tense. And the less you know about why and what is happening to the main characters, generally the better!The Cabin in the Woods does NONE of that. From pretty much the very beginning, you know what is going on - and it ruins the movie from then on. 7+ star rating? Seriously people? People rating this movie high cannot possibly have seen many TRUE horror movies. Satire, real, or not.",2,12,24,30 August 2012
