Blade Runner 2049," Beautiful and empty replicant
","Some movies are just not to be touched, revamped and continued, since they represent cult features that changed cinematography, redefined entire genres and influenced the entire pop culture.
One of those revolutionary stories and unbeaten representations of the future is the Phillip K. Dick's and Ridley Scott's masterpiece SF-noir about the robots and artificial intelligence as the ultimate frontier of mankind, ''Bladerunner'.
Unlike the many similar contemporary cash driven desires to continue the story and finally give some of the much needed answers to the 80s classics, the production team for ''Bladerunner: 2049' lead by the creator of the original, Ridley Scott, did their homework and did it well. 
They chose one of the best directors in Hollywood right now, Dennis Villeneuve and casted one of the more stellar crews in recent history of SF making (Gosling, Wright, Leto and of course, Harrison Ford). 
The visual result was just stunning, since gifted director meticulously solved every single detail in each scene. Transferring the legendary atmosphere of the first part of the (unfortunately) saga was just done with flying colors and that deserves every appraisal.
However, this is where the good things top and give way to the cancer that's eating 21st century Hollywood.
Lame scripts.
Just to be clear, the original ''Bladerunner' was probably the weakest script of all the Top 10 movies of all times it rightfully belongs to, but was also the revolutionary insight into the future, offering some of the most intriguing and so exploited concepts that followed it.
''Bladerunner: 2049' doesn't have any of those things, since it offers neither new concepts, neither viable characters, nor acting or even some decent answers. It just wanders off, not showing any signs of life and driving the stellar crew into the average, while making the script look blunt and unfinished.
''Bladerunner: 2049' is a beautiful replicant of the original movie, with some great camera, color, production and light, but also with a mediocre script unworthy of the name it continues.",5,2,6,22 December 2017
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," First one was better
","Tarantino tends to make long movie stories, so Kill Bill' wasn't much of an exception. With the overall time of over four hours, the quality and tempo of the story winds down in the second part of the saga, lacking the great standoffs from the first one. As for the directing, all the major elements are there also, with with a lesser level of homage, the creativity of sequences will be slightly lower, not diminishing Quentin's raw talent behind the camera. The epic ending will be somewhat of a anticlimactic when compared to the overall rhythm of the script as well. Kill Bill vol.2' is a good movie, but slightly weaker than the first part.",6,0,2,16 March 2017
Come and See," RUSSIAN 'APOCALYPSE NOW' ON STEROIDS
","Classic Russian cinema is THE ARTSIEST one in the world. It is built on basic graphic elements and a powerfull symbollic of the simple and direct script. 
On the other side, the Russian war movies of the past were quite often drowned in pathetic and overemphasized patriotism, which lead to a significant diminishing of their art qualities. 
All of this can not be said for the one of the most powerful and most painful to watch war stories of all time, 'Come and see'.
Elem Klimov filmed a merciless and never ending torment for the average viewer, bombarding him from the very start with unbearably intense editing of every imaginable war horror from the deepest levels of hell. Although basically empty in the script line, 'Come and see' will extinguish your soul and blow you away with one of the most powerful endings in the history of war cinema.
'Come and see' is one those movies you will watch only once, but will never forget.",8,2,4,31 March 2018
Casablanca," Good, but not that good
","Few movies had a greater impact on popular and cinematic culture than the immortal love story of Casablanca'. Hence, the expectations from it were huge and, alas, only semi fulfilled. The story is just plain straightforward, revolving around the American expatriate (Bogarth) squirming his ways around Morrocco during the Second world war. When the old love steps in (Bergmann), the cliché won't stop until the very end that is just too expected and pathetic. However, Humphrey will set the standards for the male cool behavior and some of the most memorable lines in the history of cinema will be delivered during the course of this spy and love story. Casablanca' is a good movie, but not an excellent one as the majority of ratings and reviews claim to.",6,2,8,15 March 2017
Darkest Hour," BEAUTIFUL AND PATHETIC HISTORICAL DISTORTION
","Historical drama in modern day Hollywood is in a dead end that seems endless at this moment. There are just not some decent scripts left, even if they are depicting some of the most fascinating characters and events of our civilization.
Yes, not even the rise of Winston Churchill can give us a non-sweetened and real story without much distortion of historical facts. No, ''Darkest hour'' can even grant us with some decent acting, and if Gary Oldman receives the ''Golden boy'' for his somewhat caricaturel portrayal of the greatest British politician of this century, it will represent a injustice, both to his impeccable career and his opponents in ''Kodak theater''. 
On the other hand, not everything will be dark in ''Darkest hour'', since Joe Wright will give us some really great focusing, light and overhead cuts, making it deservedly to all the major directing nominations.
''Darkest hour'' will represent the feast for the eye, but your brain will be pretty much annoyed during the entire course of the movie.",4,19,30,28 January 2018
Children of Heaven," Triumph of consistency
","Iranian cinematography is one the Asian's most influential film industries. Its reputation is primarily being built on heavy drama genre and 'Children of heaven' is one of those dramas.The story is quite simple. Brother and a sister must share a pair of sneakers due to his clumsiness that lead to the losing of her repaired shoes. Overall atmosphere is grim and heavy economical situation is the basis of the plot.On the other hand, both kid actors are just adoring and the script is really consistent in its basic punch line. Director Majid Majidi follows that consistency with its camera and action sequences (mostly running) all the way to a bit of disappointing ending.'Children of heaven' is a powerful and timeless 'family drama' for the entire family that will make you stop taking things for granted.",9,1,2,16 April 2015
The Best Years of Our Lives," COVERING ALL THE ANGLES
","Coming back form the war is one of the most popular movie themes of all times, especially for the Americans, since they didn't have the experience on fighting on the home ground for more than 200 years. Cultural and emotional shocks for both the veterans and their family and friends is the subject for one of the best movies that describes the returning of warriors after the WWII, William Wyler's 'The best years of our lives'.
Centered around three totally different stories, the crafty director manages to cover all the angles and to show that the things and the people are not who and how they seem like at the first look. The toll of war is basically same for all three men and their families, regardless of their approach, mental posture and starting and ending points. Although basically tragic, this post war syndrome story ends with a strong positive message for the generation of 'baby boomers' it was meant in the first place.
'The best years of our lives' is a solid, real and strong script that manages to avoid most of its inevitable pathetic.",7,2,3,19 May 2018
Interstellar," Deja vu
","For God's sake people, cut with your praises. Anyone who has read or seen any of the Space odyssey books/films will be bored to death watching this cheap and hollow ripoff of the story about space and time travel, alien intelligence and human/robot interfacing. The theme itself is fascinating, but the story and character development simply doesn't exist. Cuts are done with a chainsaw, story is full of holes and the twist at the end isn't as nearly dramatic as in previous Nolan's flicks. Cast is really, really terrible, lead by the Matt Daaaaaamon. Design is truly non innovative, production of the space movie looks really cheap and Zimmer's music is totally offbeat. There are some good things as well, like the scene with the video messages, or the ending design of the library scene. However, two scenes is really not nearly enough for a such hugely anticipated movie that comes from such an outstanding director. Although I consider myself a big CN fan, I must sadly admit that the Hollywood has ran him over and that his career is in a steep decline following Inception.",4,5,11,12 November 2014
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," ALMOST PERFECT
","There are still some great ideas left in Hollywood, followed by some great actors and great directors. And sometimes, all of those people get combined together in something called a great drama about a mourning mother of a murdered daughter that decides to rock the small community in Ebbing, Missouri to its foundations in an attempt to restart the police investigation that is tapping in one place for months by criticizing the local law enforcement by leasing three billboards just outside the city limits.
On that road, magnificent Frances McDormand will receive some fierce (best Sam Rockwell in years) and some moderate opposition (always reliable Woody Harrelson), while one of the most gifted directors of the younger generation (McDonagh) discreetly follows the unravelling of this peculiar social experiment. Trademark humor that we saw in ''In Bruges'' will be there as well, and everything will go smoothly till the beginning of the bottom third of the movie. 
There, the script will dissipate, as well as the motivation and actions of the main characters, leading to the disappointing ending of this great movie story.
''Three billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri'' is, beyond any doubt, the best US movie this year, although plagued by some serious flaws and it will represent no surprise if it sweeps the ''Oscars''.",8,1,5,28 January 2018
Lion," Emotional destroyer
","Behind every great movie in the history is the script, the story. And what story can be more moving than the one based on real life characters and a huge problem that devours the single largest population on Earth, one that lives in India. Child abandonment is one of the most tragic subjects the movie can tackle, so only the best ones will be recognized as the immortal ones. Australian Lion' is one of those immortal flicks that will carve its way into your brain and soul so deeply that you will end up weeping while you're watching little Saroo's journey to hell and back. With impeccable scenario, it was time for the masters of trade to step in and routinely deliver the final product. If you can say that always reliable Nicole Kidman is the Jack of all trades', Dev Patel will definitely steal the show in his first serious role on the big screen as a grown up. But, that's not all, since the real stars of this emotional earthquake of a movie will be two rookies, director Garth Davis and young Sunny Pawar. Add some great music and cinematography along the way and you you will get something truly outstanding for today's standards. Lion' is, without any doubt, THE BEST movie of 2016 and should harvest the oscars' in every major category it was nominated.",10,2,4,24 February 2017
North by Northwest," Outdated
","Hitchcock not only redefined horror and gave birth to thriller, but also managed to revamp the action genre and he did that by one of his most famous flicks, North by Northwest'. Back in the day, some of the sequences and special effects must have been a revelation to the cinema audience, but they are now almost completely non persuasive. The basic story is something we already saw in that era, as well as the trademark confused charm acting by Cary Grant. North by Northwest' was a great movie in its time, but had been overran by its successors.",3,8,20,15 March 2017
The White Ribbon," GOOD, BUT OVERRATED AS WELL
","Michael Haneke likes to make his movies long, slow and painful, so the story about the group of children that rain havoc in a desolated German village in the wake of the First World War doesn't differ much from that.
However, besides the deviation and genuine disturbed characters that this story unravels, there isn't much to offer to viewer when it comes to script writing. 
Acting will be trademark quality, as in all of Haneke's flicks, especially when it comes to children. 
On the other hand, the very end will be abrupt, without the expected climax and a conclusive wrap up of tension being built from the beginning of the movie.
''The White Ribbon'' is a good European drama, but not an excellent one critics say.",6,0,2,27 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Whatever...
","Our childhood is officially dead. Disney took care of it, by turning one of the most influential movies of all times into a brainless amusement for children with special needs. There are no new interesting worlds, there are no more breathtaking CGI and action sequences, masterpieces of design, nor some likeable characters and lines for quotations.
No, there's just market research, political correctness at any cost (black stormtrooper, his Chinese girlfriend), Mengele produced creatures (brontosaurus cows, chicken and gremlins hybrids, fish nuns and many, many more), paroding villains and no innovation at all. The storyline just doesn't exist and the new ''Star Wars'' movies are just a series of random events with no end and no beginning, raping the serious viewer or a fan with no remorse and no ending in sight. All the characters that raised entire generations will be exploited without a trace of shame and in the end, wasted with no real reason (Hamill, Fisher).
If ''Rogue one' was the lonesome spark in the dark ''Star wars'' universe, ''The Last Jedi''made sure it got smothered in a second.",1,4,8,22 December 2017
The Evil Dead," Directing foundations
","Sam Raimi's franchise about the dead coming back to life went almost side by side with Romero's Living dead' story and the parallels are unavoidable. The Evil dead' will tackle the same situation horror layout, with young people being trapped inside the lonesome cabin in the woods, but with some weaker plots and action sequences. However, Raimi will compensate the hollow script with his directing talent and trademark fast moving camera to create the tension and horror. As for the Romero, effects are really outdated, but also more gorish. Also, a whole new B-production star will be born with Bruce Campbell taking the male lead. The Evil dead' is one the flicks that made zombie trash horror genre.",5,2,3,4 April 2017
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Masterclass in directing
","Quentin Tarantino is one of the five greatest American movie directors alive. Period. His raw talent was never too easy too hide and it simply bursts with the accumulated self confidence in his greatest homage to kung-fu and Hong Kong movie creators, the Kill Bill' saga. The thing about Quentin that is so seductive is the fact he makes quality movie directing easily understandable to the average viewer. His use of camera lens, his mix of short and long cuts, lighting and flashy colors will overwhelm even those who despise the fight genre he adores so much. The revenge story will be just one step away from parody, casting the Tarantino's trademark dark humor and gore, as well as some great fighting scenes. The one in the Japanese restaurant will just represent the masterclass in action directing. Everything else, the great casting, acting and quality soundtrack will go along the path well lit by the man behind the camera. Kill Bill' is the best directed movie Tarantino made and one of the best directed movies on the turn of the centuries.",8,1,5,16 March 2017
La La Land," Ooh La La
","Modern day Hollywood hype around a certain flick is rarely deserved, and I was one of the doubters when it came to 14 (fourteen) nominations for oscars' for a musical. To be quite hones, I don't like musicals. Basically, I hate them. If I exclude the classic ones (Hair', All that jazz'), I disliked almost every single one of those who roared across Kodak theater in the '90s and early '00s (i.e. Moulin rouge!' and Chicago'). Hence, my skepticism around the much acclaimed and awaited second Damien Chazelle's long feature was really, really high. And totally undeserved. In its nutshell, La la land' is one perfectly balanced blockbuster. Although a musical, the score doesn't overpower the narrative. Although lighthearted and cheerful, it offers some serious existential questions beneath its surface. Although serious for a musical, it doesn't drown in the darkness of modern day US drama. Although funny, it criticizes both Hollywood and the world of music. Although one great homage to the good old times', city of Los Angeles, classical Hollywood and jazz, it stays way out of the pool of pathetic and tacky thank-you notes. All of this, thanks to one single man, the genius behind the camera, young and incredibly talented director and screenwriter, Damien Chazelle. Taking total control over this vast project, he shows off in every single aspect of it, nailing the certain golden boys' for best directing, cinematography, editing and production design. By casting the best available young actress (immaculate Emma Stone), he secures the reality of his characters, using the male lead (best Gosling in years) to complement her story. And the story is really one of those everyone can easily relate to, giving the widest possible audience the chance to follow it all the way to the very end. Ending is a special piece of Chazelle's art, just like the one in his previous indie hit, Whiplash'. Although a huge musical (jazz) fan, Damien doesn't produce movie fairy tales, although they certainly look that way in one point or another. The ending will lift La la land' from its shell of a elaborated romantic comedy to the level of serious drama that will stand the test of time in years to come. La la land' is the one of the best American movies in this decade and certainly the best musical in this century. It will make you laugh, cry, think over it and talk about it long after you left the cinema. Just like every great movie in cinema history does.",9,4,13,24 February 2017
It's a Wonderful Life," FOR A WHOLE FAMILY
","James Stewart was always an actor that chose the roles in the films made for the entire family and they were, with almost no exception, positive ones. 
In his cooperation with the famous Frank Capra, he chose to portray a character in a practically Christmas fairy tale made for the big screen. With the depiction of on two parallel possible stories, James with ease presents the world with and without his character, ending in a kinda sweetish, but nonetheless positive and touching way.
'It's a wonderful life' is one of those movies we loved as kinds and grew to love them even more when we have the kids of our own.",7,0,1,19 May 2018
Army of Darkness," Taking down the masks
","There are movies that were made into what they are thanks to the limited resources of their creators, forcing them to compensate the lack of money, production and special effects. Army of darkness' is on those sequels that brought all those things, but lost the connection to the first two parts, turning the entire concept into a teenage comedy. Sporadically, Bruce Campbell will make you laugh, but the overall sense will be quite empty. Army of darkness' signals the end to the entire genre in every major aspect.",2,1,3,4 April 2017
Prometheus," ''There's nothing out there. We were so wrong!''
","These two sentences maybe best describe the feeling you get when you leave the cinema after watching one of two of the year's most anticipated flicks - ''The Prometheus'' (other being the ''The dark knight rises''). Sir Ridley Scott returns to the crime scene, 33 years after he helped redefine SF-horror. Task is difficult, but full of opportunities: give the background and scientific explanation to the ''Alien'' classic, while simultaneously starting a brand new franchise in deep space using unlimited budget, computer technology, solid young actors. In the script, a brand new world, two spaceships, new alien monsters, silicate storm, Engineers, their domes, etc. This was the task. What did we get? First of all, ''Prometheus'' is one straight, flat line, with a spectator forced to run through series of short events, without having the time to think, relate or comprehend any of them. Characters are shallow, artificial and without any development. Teron and Pearce are completely redundant, as is the most of the sidekicks. Scenario is really, really unconvincing, even for a SF standards. Plot, if there was any, completely collapses after the med-pod scene, turning into a simple trash movie. Visual effects, production, 3D, camera, editing, music bring nothing new and revolutionary, due to short cuts of holograms, scenery and spaceships. Parallels to Alien are so frequent, that they become tragicomic, with an ending insulting to all the fans of the Giger's xenomorphs. There is a clear lead-in to the sequels, and the very thought of that is disturbing. This was one of THE most expected movies of my life and surely, the biggest disappointment. To give you the short version, Ridley filmed 100 times better movie on the very similar subject 33 years ago, with tight budget and no computers. ''Prometheus'' will surely end up on the graveyard of aborted SF/horror sequels and prequels, alongside with ''Matrix 2/3'', ''Transformers 2/3'', ''Predators''...",1,39,65,23 June 2012
Life," Decent clone
","Ridley Scott's Alien' inspired entire generations of movie creators and it continues to do so 'till this very day. Daniel Espinosa's Life' is one of the exact replicas of the 1979 masterpiece of SF horror and it does its ripping off relentlessly. There is no proper introduction, just plain old action and horror. The concept of the dormant alien creature (aka Calvin) that does its growing by devouring the crew of the Interantional Space Station is something we already saw more than once. All that follows represent one great mashup that stretches out to the ending credits. The A-list cast will do their parts without mistakes (especially Gyllenhaal), while the CGI will be heavily influenced by the makers of Gravity'. Script will wander off pretty early in the movie, so expect no serious and scientifically justifiable plots. Life' will not surprise you, but will succeed in amusing you, especially if you were raised on the trash SF horror of the '80s.",5,0,3,4 April 2017
Alien: Covenant," Complete disaster
","There is no nice way to put it, so I'll just say it loud: Riddley is ripe for euthanasia. A man who once defined genres and made legendary franchises that educated entire generations is now killing his masterpieces one by one. Just if Prometheus' wasn't enough, he gave birth to another retarded script that surpassed even its mediocre predecessor. There isn't one good thing about Covenant'. Not a single one. Not even one good action sequences, or just a decent CGI. No. Everything is just so missing the point, that you'll laugh instead of being scared, or just end up being utterly frustrated. Script s practically non-existent, with plot' being so lame and tragicomical that entire flick becomes a self-parody right from the opening I am your father' scene. If the script was made for the people with special demands, what can be said about the acting. Even the otherwise reliable Fassbender is just drowning in sea of pretentiousness. His scenes in a double role are meant to be the best ones in the movie, but they end being the worst ones. Neutron storm, scene with the pipes, taming the aliens with breathing in their non-existent mouths, Fassbenders kissing, vomiting facehugger's embryos... Just plain awful. All of this wouldn't bother me if Scott just came out in the open and went honest that he made a high end budget trash. No, no, he was serious, dead serious and that can't be forgiven or forgotten. Covenant' isn't just a worse Alien' movie. It's the worse American blockbuster in this decade and maybe even in this century.",1,33,65,23 May 2017
Evil Dead II," Elaborated, but dumber
","Although disconnected to the first one when it comes to scripts, Evil Dead II' will bring us more action, more money for the production and further advance of Sam Raimi's directing skills. The story will be even more dumber than in the first one, but Bruce Campbell will carry the entire flick with ease of a freshly crowned trash star. Humor and irony will also step in, distancing the flick from its predecessor in the sense of seriousness. Evil Dead II' will be honored by the genre lovers, but not many more.",4,1,2,4 April 2017
