Black Swan," Darren Aronofsky's prickly tale of the cut-throat world of ballet
","Black Swan is Darren Aronofsky's take on the ballet world with Natalie Portman as Nina a young and talented ballerina given the opportunity to be principal ballerina after it is deemed that the previous principal a bit part from Winona Ryder is beyond her best years. Nina is a perfectionist taking onto her small shoulders the responsibility of achieving all that her over bearing mother (played by an excellently neurotic Hershey) could not achieve. Their relationship is tense and strained at best akin to the relationship between Carrie and her mother in the Stephen King classic without the sharp flying objects. Nina finally is able to realise her dream when she lands the part of the Swan Queen in what the ballet director Thomas (Vincent Cassell) describes as a new take on the traditional Swan Lake. If only she can shake off the repression and guilt bestowed upon her by her mother. Thomas tries to use unorthodox methods of enhancing Nina's performance in an attempt to release the looser side of her nature to come to the fore to play the black swan as well as the twin Swan Queen.However strange things are afoot and when unconventional ballerina Lily (Kunis) joins the company it is clear that Nina must still compete for her role. Lily seems to bring out Nina's darker more rebellious nature and despite Nina's initial misgivings she lets her hair down on a drink and drug fuelled night out with Lily. Nina begins to succumb to the stifling pressure from her mother coupled with the added weight of achieving the perfection she feels she has to attain to be the best.Aronofsky has produced a masterpiece the themes of duality are played out to excellent effect with Nina trying to cope with the two opposites she has to portray in the play, the elegant and graceful Swan Queen is starkly contrasted with the dark and dangerous Black Swan. The cast is excellent with Portman giving an outstanding performance of a young woman coming to terms with her independence and burgeoning sexuality which has been heavily repressed due to her mother's controlling nature. Portman and Kunis both trained for months to get into shape to portray the incredibly fit and nubile ballerinas and this adds kudos and realism to this mesmerising picture. Aronofsky has managed to create the backstage atmosphere of a ballet company with his heightened competition bringing out the most despicable in its company members. This is most definitely a candidate for best picture and best actress.",10,1,2,24 January 2011
Sucker Punch," Sucker Punched or lobotomised....you decide???
","I cannot say that I was actually looking forward to watching this movie, when I first saw the teaser trailer and the synopsis for this story if you want to call it that I kept thinking to myself.....really?? However I remained objective even dispelling the brief reviews I was subjected to before watching this movie. I think it is at first wise to put the work of the co writer and director Zack Snyder into context as his previous work is highly entertaining I refer in particular to '300' and 'Watchmen'. His accolades are so numerous that he has been charged with bringing the new 'Superman' reboot to the screen titled simply 'Man of Steel'.The premise of this story is simple....I say that with tongue firmly in cheek!! The story takes place in the 60's where Babydoll (Emily Browning) a 20 year old girl institutionalised by her stepfather after the death of her mother she is blamed for the suspicious death of her younger sister. Once in the Lennox House of the Mentally Insane we learn that her evil stepfather has bribed one of the orderlies Blue to fake the signature of the asylum's Doctor Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino) so that in five days she is lobotomised and thus the true events of what happened to her younger sister can never come to light and the stepfather can keep the money bequeathed to the daughters. In the days leading up to her date with the doctor with the hammer she retreats into a fantasy world where she is an intern at a brothel owned by Blue (Oscar Issac). In this imaginary world she has conjured for herself she is a dancer awaiting the high roller who is to take her away for his own pleasure she meets and befriends fellow dancers; Amber (Jamie Chung), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (Jena Malone) and Rocket's older sister Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish). Madam Gorski (who is also the doctor in the real world) encourages and teaches Babydoll to dance provocatively and during the dance she regresses into another world where in turn she has to fight giant Samurai, WWI German soldiers, and an Orc infested castle and giant dragon and mechanised guards on a train containing a bomb. All these scenarios represent actions and therefore have repercussions in the brothel world she has created for herself. See simple! What can I say about this movie...well first I think that Mr Snyder is a visionary when it comes to the visual spectacle mixing glossy special effects with comic style Kung Fu and gun-play. I also think if he ever attempts to pick up a pen to write another movie someone should wrestle the pen from him and lock him in a room until he comes to his senses. The story is weak and the dialogue is excruciatingly awful Snyder's ego it appears has run away with his common sense and his holding it ransom. This is a story that makes no sense in a world of nonsense. The slow motion shots of the young women attempting to saunter around on screen looking sexy is very droll indeed and is obviously straight out of a schoolboy fantasy about women...young women. How Ms Hudgens had the audacity to defend the costume choices in this movie is beyond me. This is a perfect example of what special effects without a story can equate to.....a story containing mindless violence with purpose akin to a chocolate teapot. The movie belts along like a giant music video with the music blaring loudly, its very like a video game with each level becoming increasingly more insane than the last. I'd love to meet the movie exec' that green lighted this drivel and shout at him 'I don't think you really wanted to do that (with Harry Enfield voice). There are very few pluses here Snyder has directed at least two good movies which I have already mentioned and I am now losing some faith in his ability to bring to the screen 'Man of Steel' thankfully he isn't writing that picture so let's hope he can't mess that up. So if you're looking for mindless violence delivered by scantily clad young women beating up Orcs, dragons and giant samurai then get the new video game called oh no sorry go and see this movie....otherwise stay yo' ass at home...I wish I did!!",4,3,8,13 April 2011
Captain America: The First Avenger," The story of one of the greatest comic book icons Marvel's Captain America.
","The First Avenger is finally with us, the superhero that embodies the American spirit and what it truly means to be a hero explodes onto the big screen in brilliant colour. The story of ninety pound asthmatic weakling Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) who is so desperate to do his bit in the war against fascism that he submits himself to Dr Erskine's (Stanley Tucci) experiment to create the perfect human. Instantaneously Rogers becomes a poster boy for the Second World War and puts on about eighty pounds, he now runs faster and is stronger than any other human on Earth. But he is not alone in his abilities and he soon finds himself embroiled in the war he was so desperate to be a part in. Can the kid from Brooklyn be the hero his larger than life heart preordains him to be? If you're expecting this movie to be full of gross Americanisms and lots of flying the flag basically the ultimate U.S. propaganda spectacle and admittedly there is much that would appease the American sensibility. But this is a story about one man and his heart and courage of epic proportions, man with a propensity for good and fighting for the good of the common man. This has always been Marvel's answer to DC Comics man of steel Superman and by way of adaptation alone they have beaten Superman's most recent reboot. Joe Johnson has expertly captured that bygone era of periodic Saturday matinée serials and when you look at his resume you can see why he was chosen to depict the story of one of America's most famous sons.The acting from the lead is again surprising; Chris Evans has previously played roles full of testosterone and ego but here skilfully balances a man full of humility and guts the size of a nation. His interpretation of the star spangled man of might accurately pays homage to a hero forgotten in recent years with the onslaught of comic book characters. Hugo Weaving is suitably maniacal as Johan Schmidt aka Red Skull and Tucci is excellent as the man of great wisdom and knowledge tasked with creating a new weapon against the rising tyranny of Nazi Germany. Mr Johnson has struck a great chord with the special effects which never overtake the telling of the story but instead are skilfully used to enhance the story. If Mr Snyder wants a tip on how to bring great power and heroism to the screen he wouldn't go wrong in watching this adaptation, one only hopes that the impending Avengers can continue in this vein. Captain America receives 3 ½ out of 5 and is in cinemas now.",Null,12,21,22 August 2011
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," The classic tale of man's interference with nature for its own benefit!
","We all remember seeing the seventies movies depicting the resurgence of the Apes, man's closest cousin, usually subservient discovered by astronaut Colonel George Taylor (Charlton Heston) on a seemingly distant planet closely resembling ours. Only to find out that in fact it is Earth and George Taylor is on his beloved planet in the distant future. This franchise was unsuccessfully rebooted with Mark Wahlberg in 2001 but although impressive aesthetically it didn't do enough to warrant a sequel. Have you ever wondered how the apes managed to overthrow their distant cousins and gain supremacy over the planet? Wonder no more Rise of the Planet of the Apes tells the story of Will Rodman (James Franco a scientist desperate to find a cure for Alzheimer's a disease which ravages his father Charles (John Lithgow). Will manages to find a virus in its early stages that shows signs of being able to eradicate the disease the only downside is it seems to make apes aggressive and so his project is shelved. Will Rodman retreats with the baby chimp Caesar (Andy Serkis) who a co-worker accidentally stumbles upon. Caesar has genetically inherited the remarkable intelligent talents of his dead mother and so Will carries on his research at home. However is meddling with nature a complicated task riddled with hidden dangers and consequence? Immediately from the onset this movie sets itself apart from the original movies by briefly showing the illegal hunt for apes in the wilds of Africa and then the biological testing of these great primates in the name of science and our own advancement. The questions of the salvation of humanity at the cost of another species is evident and the capture, testing and subsequent caging of these majestic animals has uncomfortable parallels with the slave trade. Putting that aside, if you're able, and what we have here is a very entertaining reboot of a dead franchise. The clever narrative which bears some startling similarities to the underwater shark fest Deep Blue Sea is further bolstered by some excellent performances from Franco, Lithgow and especially Serkis as Caesar.The facial nuances and expressions of his virtuoso performance captured to great effect by the motion capture cameras. Mr Serkis is an expert at conveying emotions and thoughts without saying anything at all and the people of the Weta workshop have outdone themselves. The clunky animatronics and uncomfortable prosthetics are replaced with the great technical development of motion capture and computer generated imagery. The action is dished out in small equal measures until the climatic finale and it all makes for a very entertaining ride. However what makes this movie special is not just the impressive action and special effects but the wonderful tender moments between Caesar, Will and Charles. John Lithgow is excellent as the man losing himself in his disease and is deftly juxtaposed between man's surrender to his own frailty while bearing witness to the intellectual advancement of the apes. The idea of this narrative was only a brief back story from the original novel by Pierre Boulle but the movie makes enough of an impression to guarantee that the Apes will undoubtedly be with us again very soon. Rise of the Planet of the Apes receives a very worthy 4 out of 5 and is in cinemas from 11th August.",Null,1,4,22 August 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," Time travelling with a twist...
","Matt Damon's new movie outing is a science fiction romance telling the tale of a young charismatic and slightly unorthodox congressman David Norris (Damon) who is running for the United States Senate. During his campaign he meets Elise (Blunt) a beautiful contemporary dancer who bestows great honesty and wisdom upon him in the men's toilets (it's where all the pearls of wisdom are discovered) before their obvious attraction boils over, resulting in them locking lips with each other....how romantic. Thank goodness their tryst is interrupted by Norris' best friend and campaign manager and it seems without a name they are destined never to meet again. Later, however Norris is on his way to his new job working with his best friend Charlie the campaign manager he happens to sit next to the delightful Elise again and the attraction is still very much apparent. But alas this meeting was not destined to take place, a lone suited man in the park was to spill coffee on Mr Norris ensuring that he would need to return home and change his shirt thus meaning he would not see Elise again. Soon after arriving at his new employers he bears witness to an unexplained event, strangely dressed men in Charlie's office seem to be performing odd things to his uncharacteristically still friend and when he is seen he is chased and promptly caught. He awakens in another realm (masquerading as a warehouse) and discovers that the real world, his world is influenced and manipulated by the shadowy figures in the background. Life's a stage and they are the stage managers, prop guys and theatre directors. Norris is introduced to the Adjustment Bureau a group of celestial like beings who guided by the Chairman (you never see him....hint hint) help keep the human race from descending into anarchy and chaos. What ensues is a battle of wills of epic proportions as Norris fights to be with the woman he loves even if fate seems to have another design for him. This is an intriguing notion for a movie and you won't be surprised to learn (actually you might be) that the original was penned by the master of future visionary Phillip K Dick the writer of the original story behind 'Blade Runner'. This adaptation is clever as it infers that there are forces at work that ultimately determine what we do and were our lives will lead us and free will has nothing to do with it. Ironically Norris complains to Elise about having his life controlled, from everything he says, to the clothes and shoes he wears which is itself some measure of control. It is when she inspires him, during their first encounter, to be honest and true that he is set on a new path. However a path is already pre-ordained for him, but his love and no doubt rebellious temperament will not allow him to conform and he fights to stay with Elise despite the predictions of impending disaster from the Bureau members if he chooses to stay with her. This is a clever and well thought out script from the writer of the 'The Bourne Ultimatum' and it is directed with confidence and conviction. The leads exude an effervescent chemistry which draws you in and makes you care for their predicament. The members of the bureau are excellent with Anthony Mackie ('The Hurt Locker') performing his role with a quiet but awesome wisdom beyond his years. It was genius for George Nolfi to construct the story around a politician who rebels from one level of control only to be subjected to another. The religious undertones are ambiguous but at the same time clear. Are the Adjustment Bureau agents in fact angels and the Chairman in fact God...that fact is deliberately left unclear and it is for you to decide this conundrum for yourself. Life is not entirely in your hands, there are just too many variables, surely there has to be some supreme being controlling your life from behind the curtain doesn't there?? You either embrace that undeniable fact or try your damnedest to change your destiny....will love conquer all??? Check out this mesmerising romantic thriller and judge for yourself. 'The Adjustment Bureau is on general release now and I implore you to check it out!",8,1,1,13 April 2011
Rango," Western High Jinx
","Picture it a western set in the desert with desert creatures playing out this tale of desperation and woe. Enter Lars (Johnny Depp) a chameleon looking for purpose a method actor of sorts, there's irony there somewhere.....Lars after a shock to his world and surviving an encounter with a hungry hawk bumps into Beans (Isla Fisher in excellent vocal form) who takes him to the town of Dirt a lawless town in the middle of nowhere with desperate townspeople struggling to survive against insurmountable odds. They are all desperate for the precious resource that is water....I mean come on there in the middle of the Arizona desert what did they expect? Through sheer luck Lars who has now taken on the name Rango, unwittingly kills the hawk plaguing him earlier in the story and suddenly hero status is thrust upon him along with the sheriffs' badge and he starts to really live up to the role. But the water which is kept in the bank is stolen and when Rango starts to investigate he finds mystery at every corner. Can Rango solve the riddle of the missing water and get the girl....or lizard girl.....and also save the inhabitants of Dirt? When I first saw the trailer to this movie I knew I had to see it and even though the trailer was vague I was intrigued with the animation more than anything else. This is special effects company ILM's first foray into the world of animated feature and when I say they have attracted and ensemble cast they definitely have gathered together some voice talent. Joining Depp and excellent Fisher are Ned Beatty, Ray Winstone, Abigail Breslin, Alfred Molina, Harry Dean Stanton and Bill Nighy to name but a few. The film is quite simply excellent and the animation is faultless, the dialogue punchy, witty and clever. The film is full of filmic references which are ingeniously placed, for instance when Rango is being knocked about the highway and momentarily hits the windscreen of a passing red Chevy Cadillac convertible whose driver and passenger bear an uncanny resemblance to Depp and Del Toro's characters from 'Fear and Loathing in Los Vegas'. There is also the spirit of the west, an eerie like character who bears a startling resemblance to Clint Eastwood, tobacco chewing drawl and all and a nod to the excellent Coen Brothers 'Raising Arizona' via the Carter Burwell theme. The story is clever and inventive and the voice acting is sublime with Depp, Fisher and Beatty shining ever so slightly above the rest of the voice talent on offer. I honestly cannot fault this movie it was hugely entertaining and my kids loved it and although it is directed towards the young ones there's plenty here to engage the more cerebral of you......and adults. 'Rango' is on general release so catch it now before it disappears to DVD you'll enjoy it....I assure you.",9,2,4,13 April 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," The boy wizard who was destined for greatness finally comes into his own.
","The end is finally nigh, the conclusion of one of the greatest modern fairy tales of our time is now consigned to literary and movie history. I scarcely believe that J K Rowling herself could have imagined such a worldwide phenomenon that has made her one of the most respected novelists who ever put pen to paper. The story of a young boy who we have watched become a young man over the last ten years is now destined to meet his destiny and meet the dark Lord Voldermort. It all ends read the posters but who will it end for? Ms Rowling had already hinted that many of the characters would not survive with Dumbledore falling at the hands of Snape in part I. The task for our heroes is simple to destroy the dark lord you must destroy the horcruxes that contain a part of his soul. With three horcruxes destroyed in part I the trio must now find the remaining horcruxes which is no easy task with Voldermort extending his reign of terror to every corner of the wizard and muggle world. Time is running out and a confrontation of epic proportions is on the cards can good triumph over evil and can the boy who lived....live? A part of me is a little sad that's it over the global spectacle that has engrossed cinema and reading audiences is now coming to an end and it's going out in supreme style with the biggest weekend gross in history and paling into significance the box office takings of its predecessors and became the fastest movie to reach the six hundred million dollar mark in just eight days . But is it any good? In simple answer to that question yes it is! The magical world created by the J K Rowling has had some time to ingratiate itself within the hearts of minds of millions of loyal followers and casual cinema audiences alike and what's not to like. The cast assembled for these movies has been immense with the cream of the crop of British talent on offer and making stars out of the young actors chosen to carry the burden for all these years.The finale is packed with action sequences and amazing special effects but the story is the real winner here the interweaving narrative that has encompassed so many characters is brought to a thrilling conclusion. The acting as we have come to expect is excellent with the three leads coming of age in quite glorious fashion. The supporting cast are excellent and it's rather difficult to choose one person who has risen above the rest. Fiennes is excellent as the evil one on the verge of achieving his self proclaimed prophecy.If I had to choose one however it would be Alan Rickman whose back story is truly revealed and once again another hat tipped to J K Rowling for such a rich and multi layered story. There are not any bad points in this movie, epic battle check, and superior special effects check and couple that with excellent performances from a well crafted story and what we have here is cinematic heaven and a movie that is going to most certainly outdo the previous chapter in box office takings and make Warner Bros even richer than were before. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II receives 4 out of 5 and is in cinemas everywhere now so don't be silly go see it!",Null,0,0,22 August 2011
The Fighter," David O Russell and Mark Wahlberg's gritty story of boxer Micky Ward
","The Fighter which is based on a true story of 'Irish' Micky Ward (Wahlberg) a boxer who came to notoriety in the late 80's after being trained by his older brother local legend Dickie Eklund (played superbly by Bale) who's claim to fame was a title fight with Sugar Ray Robinson. The story is set in gritty working class Lowell, Massachusetts and depicts the tale of Micky Ward a could of been, almost has been boxer who is trying to break into the higher echelons of the boxing world with the help of his trainer and half brother Dickie Eklund and his mother and manager Alice Eklund (Melissa Leo).Unfortunately after his latest mismatch with a recently released prison inmate and a run in with the local law enforcement trying to save his brother from a beating at their hands Micky's right hand is broken and he is all set to give up on his dream. However after his brother is incarcerated for several criminal offences which include impersonating a police officer, Micky temporarily breaks ties with his family in order to gain another stab at his boxing dream without the help of his interfering mother and crack addicted brother. He manages to gain respect in the boxing world and is soon given the opportunity for a title bout after beating the number one contender.This is a really deft piece from David O. Russell (Three Kings) and it is in no small part down to the driving force of Mr Wahlberg who has been trying to get this movie made for about six years and serves as producer. Wahlberg trained with some of the best in the business including legendary boxer Manny Pacquiao and this shows in the boxing scenes which are strikingly realistic with Walhberg trading real blows to add authenticity to this piece. Wahlberg gives a solid performance as the would be champion whose dogged determination is akin to Walhlberg's desire to bring this story to the silver screen. The supporting cast are excellent with stand out performances from Amy Adams as Micky's devoted girlfriend and Leo as the loving and controlling mother. However it is Bale who really shines in his role as the crack addicted has been legend who grasps on to an almost forgotten past with both hands. His gritty portrayal of this down trodden character is the surprise of this movie especially as he came into the role after Brad Pitt and Matt Damon both had to turn down the role. I wouldn't be to surprised if he gets a nod in the supporting actor category with the oncoming award season upon us. The Fighter is a compelling Rockyesque story of a man who fights against the machinations of his own tawdry existence just as hard as he has to fight his opponents in the ring....true irony!!",8,2,2,24 January 2011
