Blade Runner 2049," The Good & The bad
","I had watched the original Blade Runner (now the prequel) 20 years ago when it came on TV one night and was impressed for its visuals, original world and plots and subplots. everybody in that film was interesting.Here not so much. Honestly, the only person I was curious about was the hologram girlfriend. She was one sexy babe. And then she hires a hooker for her man and they have a menage a trois. Oh my! I loved it. I long for the day I can get that because she was not just a dream. She was the visual perfection and the hooker added her body for the perfect mix. Safe to say that was different, new and though provoking. Also, I am a man so I enjoyed it.But at the end there was not enough interesting characters that I wanted to know more about. The world also was not as interesting as the original.I do not regret watching the film. It was worth the money compared to stupid films like Star Wars and Ghostbusters and whatever.",Null,6,11,30 October 2017
