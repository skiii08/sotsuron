The Hangover," Awful Awful movie ever!!!!
","This is just another stupid American comedy! I know this is rated-R for nudity and sexual content, not for the kids, but also this should not be for anyone! Shooting stun gun to grown ups was not funny at all especially by some field trip students. Making $82,000 from black jack was so unreal. Are people out of their mind to give high score for this kind of junk movie? I waste my dollars on trash?! And what's wrong with people? I sort of trusted this IMDb score setup by people. Normal people!! Maybe I was wrong... There are some exceptions. I guess there should be a new rating level for this kind of movies. IQ70!!!!!!!!!! Whoever has IQ lower than 70 can watch this kind of movies. How about that?",1,20,41,25 October 2009
