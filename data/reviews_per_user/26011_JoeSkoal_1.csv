Resident Evil: Afterlife," Resident Evil: Afterlife (2010) POOR Storyline
","The 3D was good but not great. Very little zombie killing which was a disappointment. All the good stuff was pretty much what I watched in the trailers. This movie basically played on the idea that the first 3 movies were hits to fans so they add 3D and a poor storyline. I went with all 4 of my boys and we all agreed that the villain acted more like a poor impersonation of Agent Smith (Matrix) less the Carl Sagan voice.Yes, this is based on a video game but the storyline missed the mark for a 4th movie following 3 epic movies for Resident Evil fans.It is very hard to review this movie without spoilers, so I will leave it alone and just say I would not see number 5 if it comes out. Yes, this movie will leave you guessing at the end.This movie does not qualify as a followup to the plots of the first 3 and if you never saw the movie series you will still be disappointed.",3,8,19,11 September 2010
