Sucker Punch," Another misunderstood great film
","*** SPOILERS too for Life of Pi & Tomorrowland *** I must remark that this review have spoilers about those excellent movies too.Honestly, I don't know what is wrong with the movie. I think that too many people does not really understand the message in this movie, or even talks about another kind of messages which really are not there (like feminism... some people maybe are on defensive mode all the time) I mean, the message is clear as a crystal, others messages are subjectives... even the feminist message which a lot of people finds. OK... I must agree with something there, women, by far, have suffered more abuses in our society than men, and because all characters are women in a hospital, you can believe that the message is more related with the women condition, but you can carry this message to everyone. And honestly, this really confuses me, because there is a lot of misunderstanding and incomprehension in our society. I believe that the message in a very simplistic way is: 'A brave way to escape or fight against the cruel and unfair reality, armed with a good human will which sometimes is almost unbreakable'. Some people complain about the meaning of the Babydoll lobotomy. What is the purpose of this action in the movie? Well, its very clear when you link this action with the word 'unbreakable' (there are a lot of people making lobotomies in our society).And, because I am trying to explain my astonishment with this phenomenon of the incomprehension or misrepresentation of messages in the movies, I must refer to two great films too.*** Big SPOILER of Life of Pi ***For example in the 'Life of Pi', I encounter people who still have doubts whether the adventure is about a shipwreck with a tiger; even when he explain at the hospital that it is not the true story, and that actually Richard Parker, the tiger, is he (is totally understandable why, a good boy who was pushed to make raw and cruel actions, really wants to forget this chapter of his life and never get back... that is why Richard Parker disappears in the jungle without a look back). Life of Pi, like Sucker Punch, is another way to show this will and the way that some of us overcomes, or at least fight, until the very last moment, with the really bad things in life. Maybe some people doesn't like the style of this movie and likes more the form in which the same message is portrayed in 'Life of Pi', but that doesn't make this a bad movie, in fact, is another great movie.*** A little SPOILER, but a spoiler too, of Tomorrowland ***By the way, Sucker Punch reminds me too, in some particular way, the film Tomorrowland. Another jewel not really recognized and with a great message, but this time, an optimistic and beautiful one, which people doesn't understand because most of them were waiting a lot of rollercoasters in the movie... as if that would make of Tomorrowland a better movie. Honestly, even when I don't like the term of Cult Classic, Sucker Punch, like Tomorrowland, must be called like that, obviously in their respective frames... just like other movies as Donnie Darko did it, or 'The Iron Giant'; another masterpiece of Brad Bird (the same director of Tomorrowland).",10,8,15,15 February 2016
The Finest Hours," A very good movie... but with Disney's stigma
","It's really a shame that good movies like this one, and based on true events, are not received as is deserve. This is a good movie, great scenes in the sea, emotion, suspense, and with a love story very well embedded, like Titanic did it, even when this time it is not the center of the story (for good). And even more amazing, is that the real story has enough heroism... all of us know that sometimes scripts are adjusted for the big screen (sometimes to dramatize more than the necessary).But the main problem is the stigma of being a Disney movie. Disney has accustomed the moviegoers to sea monsters or a funny guy like Sparrow, walking like he was drunk in the crucial moments (unfortunately, for a lot of people, that is a generalized idea when they listen Disney... sometimes bad movies without any kind of message, and just for kids).But no, Disney has confirmed, and most recently, that they know how to make good movies, and not just movies like 'Frozen'; don't get me wrong, Frozen is an excellent movie (I really liked), but is a very different movie. In fact, my disappointment is that 'The Finest Hours' reminds me of course with a totally different plot, another great movie of Disney which bet to originality, and which unfortunately was not appreciated as had to be: Tomorrowland... a gem very underrated (in fact, I think until now, Tomorrowland is the best Disney movie outside the animated jewels that they posses, because the originality of their story and its message).Maybe they need a new brand for the promotion of really good movies like this one, or another kind of publicity, or a different approach to the audience, because the Disney brand is resulting a bad reference for the promotion of some of their greatest films.My final thought is: If you like an adventure movie and with the human touch, you must watch this movie.",9,9,20,8 March 2016
Deadpool," To be a superhero movie, finally a good one
","A very good movie. I was really tired of bad superheroes, bad plot, ridiculous scenes which exaggerate the comedy in an awful way (the new Spiderman saga, Thor 2, Iron Man 3, Avengers, the last movie of the Fantastic 4 - no matter if Kate Mara is Sue, etc.). But this time, was a big surprise for me.Fortunately for us, this time a suitable version of a 'relatively good' Deadpool (or at least no a really deranged one) was chosen for the big screen, and creates a credible superhero, with very human and understandable motivations. And most important, this is a superhero which is not an idiot who thinks that bad guys deserve a second chance. That is what you really like in a movie like this. A real hero (even when sometimes is not really super).",9,4,15,23 February 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," OK, Mad Max was awesome... but the 1979 film
","Some people would say that I have no good taste for a masterpiece of art. I must agree with this: good sound, photography and... nothing else... OK, beautiful girls in distress. I heard direction? Come on, if I were the director, the first thing I would have done: ask for another script.This is like a bad joke compared with the strength and the whole package of the first Mad Max movie; even with some deficit in the performance of the villains in that movie, and much less FX. By the way, Max has no charisma in this new film.They tried scare us with this new post-apocalyptic world? A funny guy playing the guitar in a truck? That was funny, really funny (at some moment I thought that Duffy or Bugs Bunny could be playing a mandolin next to him). By far, I am still more scared with the raw cruelty and reality of the vision in the first movie of Mad Max, because is more near about how will look the world in the future for a lot of us.What happened to Miller?",3,17,33,11 February 2016
