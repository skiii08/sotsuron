Come and See," An Unblinking Look at Unfettered Violence in War
","Simply put, this is a devastating indictment of man's capacity for evil. Seen through the eyes of a peasant boy who cheerfully volunteers to fight invaders, the film follows him on a journey of devastation, as the Nazi machine and the men who power it haphazardly and often joyously destroy everything simple humanity believes in. In it's amazing power and depth of feeling, Come and See joins the handful of great anti-war movies, from Paths To Glory and City Of Life And Death to Fires On The Plain.This is a very dark film, brilliantly conceived by a director who lived through the period, and delivered with an unblinking eye as entire villages become surreal holocausts. If you are looking for films about the glory of battle, look elsewhere, and if you are easily disturbed by graphic imagery, you might wish to skip this sincere but disturbing journey to it's logical conclusion.",10,3,4,25 March 2013
The New World," The Way Things Were: If You Have The Patience, Malick Has The Goods
","I'd rather spend a few hours ambling in some isolated woods than the same time on a crowded city street; which might be the reason I admired the leisurely authenticity of much of this film, the immersion in a world lost the minute Europeans set out to add a new civilization.Yes, the conflict is over-simplified, and the pace of the film is often glacial, but so many of the images are lucidly brilliant, the character of the Indian princess quietly compelling and the detailing of the invasive community persuasive. The story is familiar, but the ecological sidebars attached by director Malick are not, and, even though this is a long look at more than two hours, the look at the natural world and the contrasting methods with which man utilizes it can be fascinating. Malick makes his own mark and the motive does not appear to be commercial. And good for him.",8,0,2,25 March 2013
Stop-Loss," Different Looks at Battlefield Fatigue and Down Time At Home
","I enjoy making up 'double-bill' evening nights with films that match in some way--both versions of The Maltese Falcon, for instance, or two films about pianists. An evening spent watching both Stop-Loss and The Hurt Locker comparing their strengths and weakness was fascinating,comparing brilliant and committed performances from the two lead actors, Ryan Phillippe and Jeremy Remmer. The latter film seems to center on the kind of man who is addicted to war and does his job well, but Peirce's film shows a bright young man from Texas who experiences some brutal battle, has done his time, and then is called back, simply because the war is eating up the other volunteers. It is curious that what was once a strictly male director's province, i.e., war films, has been usurped by two women: both Peirce and Kathleen Bigelow delve deeply into the male experience of battle, the former also connecting with what the people back home are feeling and experiencing. Both films question the validity of war from different viewpoints, and while not luridly political, deliver some scathing commentary on its effects on the human mind; while Stop-Loss is no Paths of Glory, it is effective story-telling, perhaps enlightening viewers clueless about those who are shipped overseas more than once.",7,1,1,3 March 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A Critical Voice In The Cinema Wilderness
","This is a perfect movie if (A) you are a twelve year old boy, (B) you like to see stunt men ejected from explosions over and over and over again (C) you will watch anything with Johnny Depp, regardless. For more discriminating adults, the two and a half hours of noise and chaos unrelieved by any semblance of careful plotting becomes tedious. Depp is certainly fun for the first half hour, sending up the pirate image by coating his eyes with kohl and sending up the Disney image by acting a little less than wholesome, but after a while, one longs for more than people screaming with swords in their hands backed up with a bombastic music score that underscores the emptiness of the enterprise.One longs for the sense of heroic purpose and genuine derring-do exemplified by Errol Flynn/ Douglas Fairbanks, Jr, or Burt Lancaster in such grand adventures as The Sea Hawk, Captain Blood, Sinbad The Sailor or The Crimson Pirate, all recently released on vivid, family-oriented DVDs; Pirates From The Carribbean is cynical corporate entertainment, the humor ironic or tongue-in-cheek, and, though marketed as such, is really not for children unless they are so desensitized to blood and savagery from video games that nightmarish visions do not bother them.",4,6,13,18 May 2013
The Secret in Their Eyes," One Reason We Go To The Movies: A Thoughtful, Well-Made Thriller for Adults
","This mesmerizing romance-thriller is not just a whodunit, although that string is laid out to follow, as after a violent rape and murder involves him, an investigator makes a case to follow not only the evidence, but fall into an indulgence of his own. This film is also about the passions each of us pursue, sometimes without knowing, and is cunningly filmed and scored, the underlying music score never intrusive but always setting a mood.It's a film about a dire time in Argentina, when corruption crept into some of the highest levels of police work--but that is just a background against which so many personal obsessions are worked out.The Secret In Their Eyes is a complex film about a couple in love, another contrasting couple out for revenge, and a system which often confounds solutions; path cross over decades and the mystery wraps up with a creepy twist which will have the thoughtful viewer puzzling for hours...at least it did me. What is the secret in their eyes? This is not a film of cheap thrills, but one for mature viewers who enjoy giving themselves to a well-made, intelligent thriller.",10,5,8,28 February 2013
Brokeback Mountain," Should Love Always Be A Reasoned Choice? Whose Life Is It, Anyway?
","One of the problems with watching this film for the first time is all the baggage that has already loaded onto it--all the controversy, all the various agendas that viewers bring to it; So many people who watch this film seem to have already prepared themselves to watch a different film--that is, they want a traditional love story, or they hope for more action, or want a Gay entitlement film or they expect it to be a conventional Western in ways that it is not. I think that the fascinating appeal of this film is that it can shoehorn itself into several genres and still come out ahead.I saw this film for the first time several days ago, and am still haunted by the repression forced on both leading men by a traditional small-town life, by expected values and early childhood experiences, by grinding poverty that gives them very little with which to enrich themselves.Who knows why we pick the people we really love, and even today, except on television talk shows, how easy is it to confess even to ourselves why we sometimes choose to be reasonable instead of passionate?The contrasts in this film between the great freedom of expansive, forested vistas and the cramped rented trailers where physical needs and emotional wounds are nursed are strong, and the performances persuasive. Brokeback Mountain has obviously touched lives in many ways, else how to explain the more than 2,000 reviews of the film on this site? I think this is a challenging film, and if you're looking to be lightly entertained, look elsewhere.",10,5,6,8 April 2013
The Day After Tomorrow," Run For Your Lives! It's Another Mammoth Disaster Film--and Fun!
","I read in one review of this film that only a stoned teenager could have enjoyed this film. Being neither, I take exception, realizing first of all that this is not Oscar bait--it's a mammoth disaster film, and everyone who plans to see it knows they are going to see things destroyed, the planet on the edge of collapse--and this film does a bang-up job of showing that.Of course the plot is cheesy--ever seen Earthquake or The Towering Inferno? Of course the characters are cardboard cutouts--this isn't African Queen or Brokeback Mountain--it's a Roland Emmerich film--remember Independence Day? Things are going to get blown up!!! The disaster film fan is given the promise, as the special effects in this fast-paced adventure are epic: the twisters through LA are spectacular effects, and the tidal washes through great cities are amazing work. Why are Quaid and Gyllenhall and Rossum in this? How about big paychecks? It's a disaster movie--you don't get on a roller coaster to cruise along as if you were in a new BMV. I had a good, zippy ride and look forward to another Saturday afternoon when I need a repeat fix--and a double order of buttered popcorn!",7,0,1,7 April 2013
Milk," How The Promise Of America Continues To Unfold
","For anyone who wants to understand how and why freedom and liberty in the USA is achieved, there are few films about contemporary life that demonstrate the process better than MILK; although this film has a documentary feel about it, mixing actual newsreel footage with enacted drama, it has a heart in Sean Penn's deeply etched portrait of a man who had the courage and the persistence to enter the heretofore closed-to-gays halls of power and to succeed. It would have been nice to have had more screen time to explore the backgrounds of both Milk and his nemesis Dan White, but at two hours, the film, loaded with committed performances from a dynamic supporting cast, neatly captures a definitive moment in national history.",9,0,2,15 March 2013
Chak de! India," Predictable Sports Film Splashed With Great Energy and A Sense of Fun
","An underdog sports team in need of a serious makeover attempts to win a world championship--you've seen it before, and you can probably guess how it ends, but the production qualities are excellent, Bollywood idol Shahrukh Khan plays the coach with immense sensitivity and charm, and the group of young women who make up the team are a wonderful cross-section of the vast country that is India.This is a national pride film, a film that makes the viewer cheer more than once, and perhaps will even bring some tears; like most Bollywood films, it is inordinately long for those accustomed to two hour movies, but unlike many Bollywood romances, there are no curious musical numbers that to Western eyes often interrupt the logical progression of plot. If you are into sports films with a Boffo Finish, looking for a perfect film for most young women with ambition, or merely a cross-cultural adventure, this is great fun.",8,2,3,28 March 2013
The Battle of Algiers," A Modern Classic On Chaos and Conflict
","One of the few films that need to be experienced first and then talked about, The Battle of Algiers is a modern masterpiece which transports the willing viewer into the middle of a conflict between some men designated by as terrorists and government forces; the director used no documentary footage, most of his actors were untrained, and yet one easily believes the intense immersion into chaos as two opposing forces utilize their own methods to force change.The truths to be found here are in human behavior, and if the situation rings true, it's because more than forty years ago, Pontecorvo zeroed in on newly developing methods of conflict--on justified torture, on women as warriors, on misdirected nationalism and inflexible morality; this film is as timely as if it were made last week. It is ineffably exciting, dynamic and truthful, a film worthy of the name 'classic.'",Null,0,1,23 March 2013
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Unusually Contemplative Western, Vivid Cinematography, Thoughtful Performances
","This often startling and frequently beautiful film is not a simple Western, definitely not a bang-bang shoot-em-up where good guy beats bad guy and everything is hunky-dory in about 90 minutes.This film is a curious sort of history lesson, a deliberate and artfully conceived look at the Cult of Celebrity, not too different from the way fame is concocted today; neither of the lead characters are particularly admirable men, as James the Outlaw has robbed and slain innocents, often merely because he finds them suspicious or annoying. The man who stalks James and ultimately shoots him (no spoiler here--check out the title!) is nervous, craven and unsettled; he projects fame and riches from the accomplishment of a craven act and must deal with unexpected consequences.There are some vivid recreations of the Old West, many contemplative shots in the snow and ice or blowing fields of wheat--the director expects the viewer's immersion in atmosphere and character--this is not an easy film to enjoy, especially if you are used to traditional Western action--but its a deeply thoughtful meditation on a culture that rolls out heroes regardless of consequence and its loaded with startling performances.",8,1,1,27 February 2013
The Chorus," A Simple Appeal To The Heart: Kindness Can Be A Good Thing
","So many professional reviews of this film grudgingly admit they were moved by it, as if it's a sin to dislike a well-made movie that moves one emotionally, as if it is always a bad thing to appeal to the better emotions, to the heart instead of the head. 'The real index of civilization,' said novelist De Berniere,'is when people are kinder than they need to be.' In an age of abrasive political commentators who have forgotten about compromise and genuine understanding, it's a joy to encounter a film about kindness and concern, a film where a firm but concerned teacher makes a selfless difference in many lives. That's what this charming and occasionally upsetting film is about, as French legend Gerard Jugnot portrays a man who brings music and discipline to a group of underprivileged students. Yes, it's an old story, and yes, it still works.",8,0,0,7 March 2013
Seabiscuit," Everybody Wins WIth Seabiscuit: The Great Horse Story Lovingly Recreated
","It's amazing that director Ross has crammed so much adventure and history and luxurious evocation of past times into two-and-a-half hours, and even better that there are three penetrating if old-fashioned performances that frequently moved this viewer to tears.Seabiscuit is the dominant horse story of the last century, from a time when such things were really important, when the communication between a human and an animal were more important than exploding buildings and noisy car crashes; this is a traditional Hollywood film that is brilliant colored, careful to recreate periods, offering, along with an ample amount of suspense and on the track adventure as well as a wee history lesson. The brilliant William H. Macy, as a seedy newscaster will make you laugh every time he appears on screen... and the 'Biscuit' will steal your heart for a while",9,2,4,6 May 2013
2012," Perfect Escapism As The World Makes A Left Turn Into Bad Traffic
","This is a Grade-A Disaster Movie, which means that human beings are put in jeopardy while their world falls apart: does anyone really take these things seriously? Some reviewers criticize Emmerich's films as if he were Ingmar Bergman, complaining about the lack of realism or about poor acting or thematic weakness. Why bother? These things are made as escapist fantasies, and Emmerich delivers. I suspect that most of us who really like an occasional escapist disaster, be it the old San Francisco film where everything falls down just after Jeannette MacDonald sings the title song, to The Towering Inferno, where everything burns up,again in San Francisco, are expecting thrills aplenty, and in this department, 2012 really delivers, with the earth's crust crumbling and spewing lava and tidal waves engulfing both the West Coast and Tibetan monasteries; John Cusack, with his air of earnest befuddlement is The Perfect Dad whose family is endangered, and there are lots of delightful cameos from such folks as Danny Glover as The President, and Woody Harrelson as a hippie broadcaster. This film is definitely not Citizen Kane or Nashville (or even Young Frankenstein!), but of its kind it's perfect, and delivers a cinematic fun-house ride with energy and dazzling imagery",8,1,2,28 February 2013
Across the Universe," Some Dazzling Intervals With The Fab Four; Mediocre Plot
","With Julie Taymor's name on the film, one expects an imaginative and colorfully individual treatment, and the Beatles songs provide just that--ranging from tender to trippy, and sometimes even to bizarre; the musical sections of this film are often an unmitigated delight, especially to anyone who grew up with The Beatles--rather refreshing to see how each familiar song is dovetailed into the plot--which, sadly, is the weak point of the film, an all-too-familiar rehash of the musical Hair in many ways, but without Hair's cutting-edge satire. One can see how the scriptwriters thought that transporting an English lad named Jude to the U.S. during the Vietnam conflict and having him meet Lucy, might make for an amusing meet-cute narrative, but in contrast to what's been done with the songs, the plot is far too predictable and unsurprising. Still, a sweet film in many ways, well worth watching as a collection of fascinating MTV-style videos",6,2,2,25 February 2013
The Incredibles," A Rich, Meaningful, Funny, And Visually Arresting Family Film
","This refreshing cartoon is so much fun! And it's honest fun, built on character and story without relying, for a change, on pooh-pooh humor or juvenile idiocy. This film has a family of all-too human characters, which, although each member has special super- human characteristics, is also burdened with all-too-human personal challenges-- whether it be a boring job, the struggle for adolescent identity, or the need to be special in some way--this family is quite wonderful. The Pixar animation is dazzling, from the recreation of wild, tossing seas to the attack of whirring saucers in a tropical jungle, pixar magic takes you there, but only in context of a thrilling story--and the characters are tellingly memorable, especially a costume designer likely based on Hollywood's Edith Head combined with Coco Chanel--who would have thought it in a kiddy pic? How refreshing to have a film that doesn't go for the cheap trick, the easy laugh, the lowest common denominator, but instead aims for genuine heart. This is a family film in the best possible sense of the word and will withstand the test of time.",10,3,4,9 May 2013
Moulin Rouge!," A Dazzling Film That Can Irritate Or Amaze, Entertain or Repel
","By reading all the varied opinions of the effect this film has on viewers, one can easily deduce it's power to attract or repel, depending on the viewer's cultural background--do you want a film that pushes the envelope or a more traditional take, well-made but linear? Moulin Rouge is in no way traditional, and therein lies it's strength for many viewers, perhaps especially for those raised on television commercials and the toys of instant communication, where a frequent change of focus is stimulating rather than irritating.As with Director Luhrmann's recent Gatsby film, the style here is the primary substance, a delirious mix of color, sound and attitude in brilliant color that never lets a moment go by without a camera zoom or background flourish; the first time I watched this strange amalgam of red and gold curtained style, I was ready for a Tylenol, mainly because I wanted some sort of coherent plot, some feeling to hang on to--every time Luhrmann hooks the viewer into an emotional moment, he whips it into something else entirely, like throwing 237 vivid MTV shorts into a blender and churning it on crumble: the second time I watched it merely for the sensual thrills (as the plot is high-school simple) and enjoyed the ride. There is little doubt that Luhrmann is able to make a dazzling film, but whether he delivers any kind of depth in human relationships or feeling is another matter entirely.",7,0,2,23 May 2013
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A Different Version, Just As It Should Be! Look Out For Exploding Grapefruit!
","I fear that I'm always running a wee bit behind in both books and films, somehow thinking that after all the talking heads get finished screaming pros and cons, one can perhaps be a little more objective and less caught up in the fray; besides, I have hundreds of films in my personal queue.Folks still seem to be searching for Gene Wilder in this film, but, amazingly, folks, he's not in it. It's a Tim Burton film, and it stars Johnny Depp and that said, I found it delightful, with an amazing other-worldly universe populated by Charlie Buckets and his fellow kiddie guests. This film, loaded with parodies of numerous other films (including the opening sequence of 2001: A Space Odyssey), is sort of a cross between The Wizard of Oz, Pee Wee's Playhouse and Metropolis, with the Oompa-Loompas standing in for all those robotic types in the latter--but this time they are Latino Lookalikes in dazzling shades of Technicolor candy.I would personally caution against showing this to very young children, as there are a few revenge scenes that are perversely (though hilariously) graphic, such as the attack of the squirrels who drag a pesky girl to a large, dark hole and dump her in (of course in Burton's world, she richly deserves it, but some kids might find it frightening). As to the cast, Freddie Highmore is an understated delight, and Depp quietly subversive, playing well against expectations. This oddity is a moral little story about goodness which, if you're in the mood for the quirky, can be fun. I think there's room in the cinematic world for both versions of this kiddie classic to exist, don't you?",7,2,3,29 March 2013
Alice in Wonderland," Wonderland Becomes A Battlefield and Alice Loses.
","While there many things to like in this film, what starts out as an imaginative and whimsical Trip to Wonderland becomes a tribute to the noisy wonders of CGI, a female empowerment film coupled with far too much Dungeons and Dragons action, a film that seemed designed for 13 year old boys with revenge on their mind. On the positive side, there is much to cherish--the sense of Cheshire Cat nuttiness was perfect, his textures breathtaking, the grin a nice combination of slightly fiendish and very friendly. The Mad Tea Party is zany and wildly inane just as author Carroll would wish, with Depp's Mad Hatter both unsettling and sometimes comforting--so far so good. I thought Anne Hathaway, too, captured an assurance that this was indeed fairy-tale in telling--but the film shortly evolves as just another battle movie, another Transformers spin-off, another noisy us vs. them, the same sort we experience in the media on the daily basis; the original Alice was an uneasy mix of wonderment and unease, a Victorians take on strange human behavior and logic gone wild, but there is nothing in the book to indicate that strange little Alice would put on armor and slay a dragon; one wonders if this is to lay groundwork for a video game to follow. And just for the record--Helena Bonham Carter needs some elocution lessons--half of what she said was lost in speed and attitude. For some this film might be worth watching once--and then return with joy to Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood or Frankenweenie for your best Tim Burton Fix.",3,2,5,27 February 2013
The Legend of 1900," Distinctive, Memorable Trip Into Someone's Floating Hideout
","This quirky and memorable journey is not so much a story as a sensual experience, exquisitely filmed with several unbelievable but joyous musical sequences. The Legend of 1900 is a strange tale, for sure, of a piano prodigy who has never had a lesson, a man born and left on a luxury liner and, as the years pass, who fears leaving the safety of his safe haven. How much better to stay safely on the sea than venture out into what some might call The Real World! Many of the formal critics cringed at the film's immersion into sentiment, but that's part and parcel of this glorious evocation of the magic of music, an immersion in a never-was-but-wish- there-was--past. Several long talky sequences go on far too long for the film to be a unalloyed joy from start to finish, but this distinctive floating world is still a wonder if you don't expect guns and sex and rock and roll.",9,0,2,26 April 2013
There Will Be Blood," The Promise of Early California: Unimaginable Riches For Those WIthout Constraints
","It seems to me that many critics of this film want it to be High Noon or My Darling Clementine, a traditional western with a linear plot where the good guy wins, want it to be something other than what it is. The title signals a good deal: There Will Be Blood: a certain tip-off to the tone and direction of the plot, a cruel and brutal study of the acquisitive personality.In the stark, rock-strewn hills of Central California at the turn of the last century, a man, not unlike his financial business counterparts in the early 21st, tries to find meaning in ownership, in denuding the earth of it's riches and turning them into individual wealth--it's an age-old story of the choice between love of family and human consideration and the amassing of great wealth. In the pursuit of power, in this in-depth study of human greed, discriminating viewers will experience a scathing indictment of an individual's detachment from all we like to think of as humane.The Daniel Day Lewis character, not unlike the more recent financial barons thieves on 21st Century Wall Street, aims to amass millions and keep them. His story, filmed brilliantly against the stark simplicity of once unspoiled land, and underscored by a sensitive, though unconventional musical score, is laid out persuasively: it's likely that another will have a difficult time laying siege to this human engine of destruction.Performances are unilaterally brilliant in this dark, somber meditation on American history, and while not particularly cheery, such information has no need to be--it is enough that the film can be a motivating and powerful experience.",9,2,3,22 March 2013
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Intelligent, Zany, Slightly Nuts Comedy Romp Without Cheap Shots
","Humor is so subjective, and what is mildly amusing is a laugh riot to another; so it is with this scattered mess, a slap-shot collection of often hilarious sight gags. I laughed often and frequently at the silliness, was aware that we're not dealing with literary wit, but material seemingly dreamed up while the guys sat around a table and played 'Can you top this?' Every viewer will have favorites: San Francisco Chron Critic LaSalle, for instance, seemed to miss what I thought was a manically nuts performance from Paul Rudd as a second-fiddle newsman: as with all the humor in this zany romp, to each his own. All of the main characters are obviously enjoying the charade--even the dog Baxter, who often speaks with subtitles and mercifully never urinates on a fire hydrant; on the same topic, this is an intelligent comedy, not needing to be riddled with flatulent jokes and the other cheap instant gags that usually flood this kind of outrÃ© humor--there is an inspired nuttiness, the kind you find in Airplane, and I enjoyed it. The humor is EXTREMELY broad, but once in a while in this daft world, a person just needs a good laugh. Ron Burgundy delivers!",7,3,4,14 April 2013
Ray," Enlightening, Enthralling Biopic With Integrity--and Great Music!
","How refreshing to see an intelligent, well-crafted film about a person who triumphs over desperate adversity instead of the mass of films that immerse the viewer in ghoulish bloody adventures or the deluge of noisy Super Hero adventures aimed at 14 year old boys, which while fine for developing pubescence, don't do a lot for adults in search of something other than walls of noise and explosions. Ray is an amazingly complex film for a two and a half hour biopic--in that time, cramming so much of a single genius into such a small patch of film is amazing,It's about the development of character, and music, and national history, and is a multi-faceted biography about a fellow man who left a positive mark on the culture. The casting is uniformly superb, with Foxx compelling and unforgettable, and even small roles memorably cast, whether it's the young kid who plays Charles as a tot, or the fleeting cameo that plays Jimmy Davis--even from a liberal point of view, it's the sort of film that reflects the best about America instead of swimming in self-pity and self- aggrandizement, Ray is never a film about blabby 'issues' and failure, but instead about perseverance and personal triumph. Charles was no angel, but he grew in so many ways and left an indelible mark on the culture; this film has done the same.",9,1,2,15 May 2013
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," A Powerful Indictment of War
","This brutal and powerful immersion in the experience of people in a country torn asunder by forces outside their control has probably never been more timely than it is today, and for many reasons, not the least is the effect outside forces are having on the local people in The Middle East--whether you root for or against the activity in Irag or Afghanistan or Syria, it will echo in your head as you watch what went on in Korea some fifty years ago, a 'police action' still ringing with repercussions today.Tae Guk Gi, besides documenting the hideous reality of being dragged into fighting against common sense, is also the moving story of two brothers and their immediate family, of separation physically and emotionally; some of the over-the-top emoting may seem extreme, but so are the situations, and the film cunningly details what happens when governments are changed at the whim of those currently in power. This is an epic worth watching, but in the excellent company of anti-war films such as All Quiet On The Western Front, Come and See and City of Life And Death is certainly is not an entertainment.",10,5,5,9 May 2013
