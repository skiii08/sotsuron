Blade Runner 2049," Not good, very disappointing
","Well, I was so looking forward to this movie. And I am so disappointed after watching it (in IMAX 3d). The film looks good, actors are okay but the story is so weak... Unbelievable that they didn't see this in an earlier stage. To use the ending from the first movie (1982) in this way is very tricky in my opinion (Rachel pregnant??? Come on). But then the script... It is bad, the pacing of the movie: bad. Really too slow. The score: too much, too loud. I might watch it again in half a year to see what is does then. But for now: 4 out of 10.",4,6,12,16 October 2017
