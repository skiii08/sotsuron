Minority Report," Master Spielberg strikes back!
","Steven Spielberg has been responsible for many masterpieces, and Minority Report is the latest. Tom Cruise gives one of his best performances as policeman John Anderton, a guy who has suffered great pain in life and works at the 'Precrime' department, where future murders are predicted, causing the policemen led by Tom to hunt the soon-to-be criminal. But then he starts to have some problems. The system doesn't seem to work so well after all. Spielberg has created an amazing and very believable view of the future. The images are just incredible (cinematography is by Janusz Kaminsky, who worked with Spielberg on 'Saving Private Ryan'), special effects are perfect and fit perfectly in the story, and the cast is simply outstanding. As always, John Williams has made an excellent score, although this one is not as melodious as most of his music. The music accompanies the images perfectly, though. That's another characteristic of movies by Spielberg. It's hard to find another director that knows so well how to accomplish the perfect counterpoint between image and sound. Right in the beginning, there's a brilliant scene involving Tom Cruise working in the office, investigating a crime which is about to be committed as he listens to Schubert's 'Unfinished' symphony. The combination of image and sound are perfect in this scene, and the effect is undescribable. You have to see it for yourself in order to understand what I mean. Spielberg fans will love this movie, and other people will like it as well.",10,0,0,1 August 2002
The Shawshank Redemption," I movie that reminds us why we love Cinema
","I saw this movie yesterday again. First time I saw it I was 13, and I had already loved it. The pleasure and sensations felt while watching this picture are difficult to describe. It had been a long time since I had last felt this way about a movie. I was completely submersed in the plot, all my mind concentrated in the facts of the movie. One loses connection with reality and, for some time, one's life disappears and the movie becomes one's life. This is the sign that indicates us that we are in presence of a great masterpiece. The plot is a beautiful story about hope, freedom and friendship. The cast couldn't be better: both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman (one of the greatest actors of all time, when are they going to give him an Oscar?) are superb in the leading roles. Supporting cast is great too, especially veteran James Whitmore. Thomas Newton composed the music, which perfectly supports the scenes in an extremely subtle, but at the same time incredibly effective way. It brings sensibility to the images without using sentimental tricks. And this is one of the great qualities of the movie: it's moving and evocative, without ever being sentimental. Sentimental music could have ruined the movie, but Thomas Newman made a great job. The director of photography is Roger Deakins, who has already astonished us with the amazing black and white photography of 'The man who wasn't there'. A masterpiece.",10,0,0,11 October 2002
