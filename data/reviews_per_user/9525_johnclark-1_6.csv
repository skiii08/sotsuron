Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," An issue filled film
","Sacha Baron Cohen, is he the British Robin Williams or what (this isn't a question.)This seemingly low budget film was made in the manner of Candid Camera, except this had a visible camera crew keeping straight faces shooting an unsuspecting unpaid uncontracted non-union supporting cast of thousands. The question raises its ugly head, did they all sign releases? SAG minimum perhaps for those whose voices were clearly heard speaking meaningful words, but what if they refused the bait? Can't be. Ordinary-people ignorant, but isn't that risky? Are the producers and distributors open to a class action suit? We'll see. This, too, is America.Oh yes, I thought that all these kept-in-the-dark people delivered first class completely believable performances aka natural behavior, no actory shtik to be seen anywhere. Ensemble performances professionals should envy and audit. Indeed, we have already learned that anyone can act in this age of digitally made movies, and the trick for those without training is to find out what's stopping them. Professionals be warned!2 questions: Why does one have to be rich educated Jewish to get away with anti-semitic comedy bits? And how did this movie deal with all of these to me more interesting social and business issues, with the grosses going well into nine figures worldwide?",Null,1,1,14 October 2007
Dunkirk," Where's a Narrative with Connected Tissue?
","Mr. Nolan thinks that he can break the basic rules of story telling without fear because, well, he is Christopher Nolan.One of the first rules is you have to CARE about your leading characters. Does this happen here? Did we ever get to know anything about the characters' character? No. We look at the thin-lipped dour-faced fave of British drama, the Right Hon, no, Lord, not yet, Sir, Kenneth Branagh. He, along with everyone else, is but a puppet for Mr. Nolan to pull the strings of.As Documentary with punch, OK. As Drama, definitely not. I felt I'd been cheated out of a clear story line, a connected narrative.Mr. Nolan might benefit from examining the book for all screenwriters, Robert McKee's STORY (substance, structure, style and principles of screen writing).As I left the Imax Cinema on Citiwalk at Universal last night, a feast of Forrest Gump shrimp filled the empty space in my stomach, if not my assaulted brain.",4,6,11,2 August 2017
The Shape of Water," Believed little except the acting.
","I give this movie 3 stars only.
The story (concept) was intriguing, but
The writing was muddled, and dialogue often made no sense.
The casting and acting were spot on but 
The directing and editing were strangely bad. I mean in the shot to shot, the cutting, the way the scenes followed each other. Logic and clarity went out the window.I have only one rule when I am being entertained. (Incorporating style always,) do I BELIEVE what I'm watching? Throughout this movie, I kept being pulled up short.
The creature's costume, why no attempt to integrate the face with scales? oh no, mustn't completely hide the actor's handsome American features.
Our heroine, was she to be pitied? No, she had friends and sympathy all around. Not downtrodden.
These cleaning ladies, since when were cleaning ladies in public spaces chatted up by absolutely everybody as 'equals' even in the toilet?
I could go on, and on, and on, but cannot be bothered. This was an ego trip by one person, the movie maker.
I comment that people are afraid to come out and criticise for fear of sounding ignorant. I forecast that it will do no business at the box offce.",3,6,24,9 January 2018
The Reader," Exciting reviews!
","Sat through it, catching short periods of snooze time, and woke up near the end, over at last. Wondered more about how Kate's husband felt about his wife exposing herself to mouthwatering hordes of oglers, some of whom actually criticized the quality of her charms, than to caring about what was going on story-wise. Had to read these reviews to find out what I'd missed.This may be off-topic, but what better film to comment on the fact that professional reviewers are way less interesting than the weighing in of user views seen here, as honest and politically incorrect as you can get. Time is close when we will not need or want professional reviews. They anyway tell us more about the reviewer than about the film under scrutiny, and the pros must lead very narrow and boring lives.I have a confession. I've chosen the 'hated it' setting as being more rewarding to start the examination of a movie. I've seldom read such original and colorful material. Exciting!",3,3,10,22 February 2010
The Queen," Leave them alone
","There was a time, I believe, when to depict any living member of Britain's Royal Family was simply not allowed, whether by law or Royal Proclamation I'm not sure. I guess the rules were changed somewhere down the line. What hasn't changed is the Royal Family's inability to respond, to fight back, publicly, their only refuge being to 'rise above.' Revenge is not in their arsenal.Brits and Canadians and New Zealanders and Aussies, and others, will tell you that while their feelings may be mixed (in the same way that they can be with parents), the very idea of Royalty, uniting together a Kingdom, with its central theme of continuity and tradition and dignity and its separation from the ever-changing politics of the day, make for an emotional tear-in-the-eye response from those who have ever been connected to, for example, soldiers or sailors or airmen. Symbols abound; HMS, the Red Duster, Royal Mail, products produced 'By Appointment to ...', the Changing of the Guard, 'Great' Britain, the Opening of Parliament, the Christmas speech, the Victoria Cross, Westminster Abbey, the myriad name appendages of Sir and Lord, and other honors (admittedly not always deserved.)In short, for reasons that are hugely subjective and incapable of being pinned down, we, and I am one of the majority who wouldn't have it any other way, are left with National Pride. Being so, a fictional and personalized account of current royal life promoted by an opportunistic for-profit commercial enterprise, is an affront. And it's not a matter of whether such accounts of royal goings-on of the living are truthful - as if anyone knows - but to pretend to know is a lie and an impertinence. Their interactions should remain private - and a mystery, until such time as they pass into history. Then, and only then, have at them by all means. Portrayals such as 'The Queen' are, simply put, ill-intentioned and damaging, especially if they are well made; they contribute only negative input. Unless we want to end up a floundering Republican mess, like the U.S. of A.",Null,1,2,2 September 2007
Rear Window," But did you believe it?
","Never saw the whole thing through until tonight, on TCM. And I must say, I again got impatient with Hitchcock's penchant for manipulating reality, as if it didn't matter, in setting up his character conflicts towards suspenseful endings. It's all to do with believing what you see. One should not take for granted any audiences, all of whom are familiar with real life.The film begins with a long long establishing panning shot of the location and ends up in tight close-up of our hero at the window, which was fine, but why was the camera movement so shaky? Surely smooth pans were achievable back in 1954, weren't they?Then silly little things annoyed me. Like, did New Yorkers ever leave their front doors unlocked? When I lived there in the early sixties, we installed police locks, because regular locks were deemed too easy for intruders to break in. And what was with the SLR camera and its huge long lens that Stewart kept peering through? He wasn't taking pictures, he seemed to be using it as a telescope in preference to his powerful binoculars.Dramatic writing skill consists largely of giving information necessary to the plot in well disguised ways. When we first meet Grace Kelly, the method used to reveal her character's name was by her pointing out bits of furniture after herself - embarrassing. And one could not believe her sudden conversion from scorn to belief in Stewart's suspicions, nor her journey to dig up the murderer's garden while wearing the long flowing 'new look' fashion, nor her break-in climbing ladders to get into his apartment.What I'm saying is that paying attention to real-life situations to serve the setting up of dramatic conflict has always been a challenge for film-makers, and if done successfully can only serve to make the finished product much more acceptable - suspension of disbelief being key. Hitchcock too often reveals a contempt for this, preferring to manipulate the small details of real life, in order to serve what he sees as his higher purpose.",5,17,31,28 June 2009
