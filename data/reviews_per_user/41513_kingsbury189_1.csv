The Ring," Never watch this alone!!!
","I watched this movie and wound up clutching my best friend the whole time. The beginning is a setup for a great urban legend- two girls, one recalls watching a 'cursed videotape', there is a creepy sequence, and then she meets her end at the hands of an evil little girl who looks like she hasn't showered in years... The rest of the movie features Naomi Watts trying to figure out how to stop the videotape's destructive path. If you haven't figured it out already, all who watch this tape receive a phone call warning them that they will die seven days later. There are plenty of scares and a few surprises. All in all, this movie is NEVER to be watched alone, in the dark, or a combination of the two. This is one of the really successful horror films that don't rely on blood and gore to give you a real jolt.",9,3,5,4 June 2007
