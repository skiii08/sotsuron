The Rock," Hans Zimmer alone is quite enough to make a movie worth while.
","A great actioner, a bit too long though. Sean Connery is the best as always. I don't like performances by Nicholas Cage in general, so I am not going to comment on him. Ed Harris is in a role that suits him like a glove. David Morse is in his usual role of the 'best friend, second in charge, right hand of the hero/antihero', at which he excels. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is simply amazing. One should run and purchase it right after the end-titles. In spite of this all, 8/10, due to:a) the plot and dialogs being too ridiculous even for an action movie,b) as I have mentioned in the beginning, it is too long.",Null,1,1,4 April 2002
Se7en," What's the fuss?
","So, here we have another one of those 'suspense' movies...Where is the suspense? Where is the thrill? A film of this genre should have an atmosphere, make you excited, cause you to try to guess what the next move is going to be, and most of all - provide a surprising end. None of those exist in this creation of Hollywood movie industry. If the only way to keep the viewer focused and somewhat interested is by presenting more and more gruesome ways of murder - something is very wrong here. Any R-rated movie from the shelves marked 'Horrow' in your local video-store can provide such an entertaiment. Yet there are much more expectations from the cast involved in this project. Conclusion: bigger is not always better. This movie is supposed to be 'Silence of the lambs' times 7, but it is not even close to the brilliant original.",3,4,10,16 November 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," What's all the hype about???
","As someone who could not make himself read more than the first 50 pages of 'Hobbit', I was highly expecting this movie, hoping it would provide me with an opportunity to see what I was missing and what everybody was talking about. I also hoped watching the movie would encourage  me to try to read the book again... What can I say? Too long, too straight-forward with every move expected, without any real character development... An Academy Award? Absolutely, the one for Special Effects. By the way, I still can not make myself read the book. Conclusion: If you are not into 'Dungeons and Dragons' stuff, this is not a 'must-see' for you. 5/10",2,1,2,13 March 2002
