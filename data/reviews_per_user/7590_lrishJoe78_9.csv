Black Swan," Original psychological thriller
","This movie is an examination of obsession, and a mother living vicariously through her daughter. Ultimately it proves to be a journey into madness. Natalie Portman is utterly believable throughout as the shy but talented Nina Sayers, and deserves the awards she is likely to receive for this performance. Mila Kunis plays the darker role of Lily with equal skill and style. For me, these two make the movie although they are very ably supported by Barbara Hershey as Ninas mother, Winona Ryder as the usurped prima ballerina, and Vincent Cassel as the company's artistic director.Black Swan has to be one of the more original psychological thrillers in recent years. Although the first hour goes a little slowly, there is a complex plot building all the while. As the film goes on, and it becomes clear that the line between hallucination and reality is fading for Nina, the skills of director Darren Aronofsky really come to the fore. The production is superb, with beautiful camera work and light use of CGI to illustrate the hallucinations which are taking Nina over. Overall this is a highly enjoyable and well delivered movie, with a tight story and plenty of surprises in store!",8,1,3,9 December 2012
The Secret in Their Eyes," Cinema at it's best
","This is it. Cinema at its best. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen until lights came up, and I never saw the final twist coming. A thriller, with likable characters, a sense of humour, and a plot that develops at just the right pace. The acting is wonderful, and the direction and cinematography support the plot perfectly. The camera work is fantastic throughout, and there is one scene with a single sweeping shot from high above a football stadium down to crowd level which is truly amazing. In the end this is a movie about two kinds of love and one kind of passion, but it's far from clichéd. If you get the chance to see this one, don't miss it.",9,7,8,9 December 2012
Rise of the Guardians," Dreamworks deliver Avengers-esque tale for all the family
","The premise here is that four legendary characters - Santa Claus, the Sandman, the Tooth Fairy, and the Easter Bunny - are a team of 'Guardians' protecting the world's children. We learn that they were brought together by the Man in the Moon, and it is he who introduces a fifth member in the form of Jack Frost to help them when the Boogeyman attacks. This is based on William Joyce's ongoing 'Guardians of Childhood' book series, apparently inspired by his six year old daughter when she asked if Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny knew each other. The setup has a lot of obvious parallels with the Avengers, though aimed at a broader/younger audience.The movie characters are clever re-imaginings of the traditional personae, with Bunny being a tough Australian more kangaroo than a rabbit and Santa ('Nicholas St. North') a tattooed smart leader for the group. Jack is the outsider protagonist, and Pitch Black is the spurned Boogeyman, and the similarity in their motives adds an extra plot layer that works well. The voices are great too without exception, though Alec Baldwin was especially good as North.The animation is brilliant, the best quality I've seen in a while, especially the sand as it morphs into different shapes, objects, and animals. This was well worth seeing on the big screen in 3D as some of the effects are really impressive; the kids actually let out a few involuntary ooohs at the snowflakes floating off the screen.I can imagine this spawning a sequel or two, and I think the characters are strong enough to carry it too.All in all a great family movie for Christmas, or Easter, or any time really!",8,1,3,9 December 2012
The White Ribbon," Haneke at his best
","Michael Haneke said in an interview for Le Monde that he intended to make a movie about the roots of evil. He said that he believed that the environment of extreme, punitive and sexually repressive Protestantism in Germany has laid the groundwork for Fascism and Nazism. He also said that he saw the same patterns developing in fundamentalist Muslim societies today, and that it is those societies that today were spawning terrorists and suicide bombers. He said he wanted 'The White Ribbon' to be a movie against ALL extremisms.This is absolutely Haneke at his best. Stunning black and white film, with a real mystery that he leaves the audience to figure out for themselves. Throughout the film there is a sense of brooding and malevolence, personified in the children of the village (spookily played by one and all) who seem to be forces of evil. The events that take place in the village are never really explained, but that is the Hanneke experience, and serves to make the movie all the more thought-provoking.A fascinating movie on several levels, which will leave you wondering long after the final credits.",8,0,2,9 December 2012
No Country for Old Men," Wonderful!
","I decided to read Cormac McCarthys book before watching this movie adaptation, having been a big fan of his more recent novel The Road. I loved the book and ended up uncertain if I wanted to watch the movie as I it was hard to imagine the Coen brothers being able to do it justice. Overall though, I was impressed with their treatment of the story, both in following the text closely and in terms of playing out the author's intentions rather than undermining or erasing them.Having said that, there are some real differences between the two which to me meant the film didn't quite deliver on the story in the way the book did. Most of these differences probably came from a need to keep the running time down, but personally I would have been happy for the movie to be an hour longer and to follow more of the subplots of the book. The most important of those differences for me:â¢ In the book Carla Jean calls the coin toss incorrectly and Chigurh shoots her. They have pretty much the same conversation in both versions, but in the Coens version she refuses to call the toss forcing Chigurh to see it is he, not the coin, deciding her fate.â¢ The book explains why we meet Chigurh in jail, saying he permitted himself to be captured 'to see if I could extricate myself by an act of will'. Later Chigurh describes this as a vain, foolish act. These facts are not in the movie.â¢ The first hotel confrontation between Moss and Chigurh is altered in the movie; rather than punching out the lock and wounding Moss, Chigurh takes a key from the murdered receptionist and enters Moss' room, where a hiding Moss takes him captive at gunpoint, so they have a chance to see and know each other. Then Moss runs and the shootout begins.â¢ In the book Chigurh delivers the recovered cash to a man he's never met before, and a conversation ensues. In the film it is fairly unclear who Chigurh works for, which makes his character hard to understand.â¢ Where the film last sees Moss alive heading off to have a beer with a lady who calls to him from poolside at her hotel, the book has a whole subplot between him and a young female hitchhiker, to whom he gives money and advice. He actually dies because he puts down his gun when the Mexicans following him take her hostage. This was a big part of the development of the Moss character in the book, with it being clear that Moss was loyal to his wife and would not take advantage of the teenager even when propositioned, and afterwards the hanging question of what his wife would think when he was found dead in a motel with a teenage runaway.Anyway, book versus film aside, this movie features some truly brilliant performances, and is an astounding achievement in storytelling and filmmaking. Wonderful!",9,5,6,9 December 2012
Downfall," Brilliant!
","This film is a truly admirable attempt to examine the character and mindset of Hitler and those closest to him. Indeed, I think it must be the most engaging and thought-provoking WWII movie I have seen. If this had been a Hollywood production with Hollywood stars it would not have had this impact, but it is German-made and its director (Oliver Hirschbiegel) seemed to go out of his way to avoid leading the viewer to any conclusion, instead allowing everyone to form their own opinion based on the facts. Too often the horrors of WWII led writers and directors to depict Nazis as monsters, but this misses the real story; the question of how they became monsters. In a way, the human Hitler which Hirschbiegel shows us is more guilty than a raving monster since it is clear he made choices to do wrong.Bruno Ganz is absolutely convincing as Hitler, Ulrich Matthes plays Joseph Goebbels wonderfully, and indeed the rest of the cast are all excellent.Highly recommended viewing and well worth the almost three hours running time.",9,1,2,9 December 2012
Prometheus," Extremely disappointing
","The ONLY positive thing I can say about this is that it looks great on screen, stunning actually at times. Everything else was disastrous. The biggest problem was the plot, which would have been naive and clichéd if it had been done well, but did not even live up to that and ended up being simply nonsensical. I could literally list dozens of contradictions, holes and unexplainable oddities in the storyline. Then there was the acting which was uninspired to be kind about it, which obviously leads you to wonder about the direction. I find it hard to understand how a movie like this which should have been great can go so completely wrong and not be caught by the studio quality control somewhere before release, or perhaps it was too far gone too fix by then. I find it harder to understand how people are giving this movie positive reviews. Major disappointment given the director's history with this genre.",3,8,13,22 December 2012
Moon," Solid sci-fi debut
","This was the feature directorial debut for Duncan (Zowie Haywood) Jones, formerly known as Zowie Bowie and son of David Bowie, and was shot with a relatively modest budget of $5m. That pushed the seven star rating I would normally have given this film up to an eight.The story is set in the future and follows Sam Bell who is a miner approaching the end of a three-year contract working entirely alone at a lunar mining base. He has only an intelligent robot called GERTY (remember HAL?) for company, plus occasional video messages from his wife on earth. He is cracking up from loneliness and looking forward to leaving in a few weeks when a accident while working sets an unexpected series of events in motion.Jones has clearly tried hard to evoke sci-fi classics from the 1960s up to the 1980s, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Silent Running (1971), and Alien (1979). That is visible in the writing, with the futuristic sci-fi context being used only to support the story rather than being allowed to take over as so often happens nowadays with special effects such a focus in sci-fi. It is also visible in the cinematography which uses the enclosed spaces of the lunar mining base to great effect and the colouring work done on the movie has given a real retro feel to the images. Gavin Rothery who worked on visual effects for the movie has some fascinating background on all of this on his blog at http://www.gavinrothery.com/moon-blog-index . All of this works really well and is impressive given the limited resources.Where the movie goes wrong for me is that after a great build-up, it seems to fizzle out in the last quarter. There are many questions created in the mind of the viewer but never answered, and suggestions made that are not followed up, and many possibilities for deeper explorations of the reasons, meanings, effects of the issues raised that are never pursued. And so it leaves and unsatisfying taste in your mouth. Perhaps the story should have been paced differently to keep the big reveal of Sam's mystery until closer to the end? Or maybe the pacing was right and we just needed more depth of detail towards the end, which could have been dropped due to the tight budget of course.Anyhow, this is on the whole an enjoyable, thought-provoking and solid sci-fi flick and I'll be watching out for Duncan Jones' next feature.p.s. Since I've focused only on Jones, I should say that Sam Rockwell was excellent as the one proper character (Sam Bell) in the movie, and GERTY is ably voiced by Kevin Spacey also.",8,1,4,1 January 2013
Slumdog Millionaire," Fantastic feel good fun
","Danny Boyle has been a favorite of mine since Shallow Grave, and this has to be a strong candidate for his best film. It is visually stunning throughout with amazing Indian locations giving the film real colour. It's funny, sad, thrilling, and clever all at once. The soundtrack is brilliant. The acting is brilliant. The costumes are brilliant. You get the picture....This is a rare thing nowadays -- a movie that really lives up to its tagline, 'the feel good film of the decade'. If you haven't seen it you definitely should, it'll make you laugh and leave a smile on your face for sure.",9,1,3,9 December 2012
