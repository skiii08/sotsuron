Black Swan," Confusing
","I'm a very bright person, I pass school with high marks, I've been studying art, history and film in University and I've seen this movie twice. Even after looking up the explanation for this movie I just did not get it at all.Half the time I had no idea what was happening and the other half I was bored. I don't understand why everyone loves this movie so much it's just plain awful. It says I haven't typed enough so i'll just ramble from here, the special effects were alright from what little there were. I thought that the masturbation part with her mom sleeping in the room was a little odd and unrealistic (who wakes up and does that?) and I'm not sure why they made the lesbian scene a dream. Overall, don't bother watching this unless you're a hardcore art interpreter or something. I don't want to put in a lot of effort when I watch a film and this one was just a headache.
