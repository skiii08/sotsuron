Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Long live Kazakhstan! BORAT is a riot, first time EVER I laughed soda through my nose at a theater
","Oh dear, this has to be the first and best time I've had at a theater in god knows how long. 'Borat' had me laughing so much that I literally, shot soda out of my nose. It hurt so much, the comic genius overwhelmed me so much I could not drink anything because I was too afraid that I'd end up shooting it out of my nose. Cohen portraits a journalist named Borat who is sent to American from the glorious nation of Kazakhstan (long live Kazakhstan!). While there Borat becomes sidetracked when he tries to hunt down and marry Pamela Anderson. WIth a documentary crew capturing the insanity that entails, Borat learns the lessons of America and the big city. Looking back 'Borat' is depraved and disgusting, the humor is filthy and wrong all the time. But Cohen delightfully changes the outlook and makes it side splitting. I absolutely loved 'Borat', one of the funniest movies made since 'This is Spinal Tap' or EVER. A very very high ****",10,2,15,4 November 2006
Mission: Impossible III," A snooze CRUISE, Tom's character is just as crazy as Tom himself
","Da-da-da-da-duh-da-da-da, the score to the new and third action packed flick 'MI3'. Again the same score can mean one thing, action or just espionage in a dull form like the first two? Well the music does recall the first two and Hoffman just off his Oscar for 'Capote' immediately jumps on a suspense summer flick. Sorry Phil no Oscar for this one. Ethan Hunt (Cruise) has again returned but of course battles along side a villain, Owen (Hoffman). The two fiends fighting for the valuable rabbit's foot. If the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE franchise turns out to be anything like BOND'S then we are in for some serious melodramatic, overplayed, world domination (!) that won't let up. Perhaps there will be three or four Ethan Hunt's like bond himself.",6,1,2,10 May 2006
Corpse Bride," A creepy, spooky, fantastically done non stop animated cartoon for both kids and adults
","***1/2 Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Depp Roy. Directed by Tim Burton. Burton makes his second trip to the underworld even better than a Nightmare Before Christmas. Of course casting his buddy Johnny Depp to play the shy Victor Van Dort who on the day of his wedding vanishes and accidentally marries the beautiful yet dead Corpse Bride (Carter). She takes victor on a wild rush through the underworld where he sees life after death. Burton yet again does a fantastic job at animation with his team. Bravo on all the people's parts that made this movie possible. A fantastic film both visually and virtually. My final rating 9/10.",9,3,7,25 September 2005
The Hills Have Eyes," Perhaps the one all along that needed 'eyes' was Aja to see what a piece of crap he was making
","A typical horror film, all gore no plot. Sure 'Hills have eyes' has plenty of gore, guts and blood charged adrenaline but the acting is lame and a cheap rip-off of Craven's 'Eyes'. The story focuses on a family headed out west until they run into a band of mutants, I will admit Nicotero did a great job with the effects but that's to the extent to it. All style no substance, all gore no galore. Alexander Aja would be wise to come up with his own junk not other people's once brilliant ideas. To think they remade a lot of classic horror since 2005, John Carpenter's 'The Fog', along with 'When a Stranger Calls' and now 'Eyes', all 70's-80's films are here by gone. Hollywood is sucking them up, its a shame to see this happen to a great film.---1/10",1,2,4,28 March 2006
The Illusionist," The true illusion is this movie works well, Norton and Giamatti are fantastic
","One of the years best films, and I thought for sure it would be tiring since later this year you have another magic movie coming out. With Bale and Jackman, but so far this movie sweeps away any competition of opening week. The story follows a magician (Norton, Oscar Worthy trend) who falls for a beautiful woman (Biel) in a higher social standing than himself. But when she is to be wed he uses his unique ability of the 'dark arts' to win her love back. 'The Illusionist' is smart and probably will end up very underrated. And of course Oscar snubbed. By far the best movie I've seen all month long I enjoyed the magic, the sense of wonder and just everything about it. ****",10,3,4,18 August 2006
The Departed," Ladies and Gentlemen I give you Mr. Scorsese's first BEST DIRECTOR WIN, excellent on every caliber, the best movie of the year
","Wow, I have always been a big Scorsese fan with 'Raging Bull' to 'Goodfellas' and even 'The Aviator'. And he still holds his place as one of the best directors, just hearing his name will get me to see a movie. And this is without a doubt one of the five best movies he's ever made ('Goodfellas', 'Bull', 'Taxi Driver' and 'Casino' being the others I.M.O). Again teaming with DiCaprio for the third time along with screen legends Nicholson and Sheen who are both great (especially Jack). I'll spare you the whole complicated story line because it is just too long to explain but it is a brilliant, well crafted and stunning piece of americana. Scorsese is in top notch form and deserves the damn Oscar already, the best movie I have seen all year long. I loved 'The Departed' - ****",10,1,3,6 October 2006
Casino Royale," Craig oozes the essence of 'Bond...James Bond', this CASINO is ROYAL(E) indeed!
","From the start from the legendary opening scene to the beautiful girls, Bond is back and in full force. After the studio's stumbling about trying to get the 6th Bond I can safely say they made the right choice. 'Casino Royale' which was originally made in 1967 with Woody Allen is now the birth of Bond yes James Bond played by Daniel Craig. Bond's first mission is to be sure to stop a man from winning a tournament to fund an evil company. The villain and plan is pretty simple but hell is sure ain't 'Moonraker'. Eva who plays the Bond babe is a perfect choice, she is charming, beautiful and perfect (not as good as Halle Berry of course ;) 'Casino' is very action packed and a nice start for Bond I am excited for the rumored Bond 22 with Craig returning as the martini-loving, babe catching 'Bond...James Bond' - ***1/2",9,0,3,18 November 2006
