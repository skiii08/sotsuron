The Blair Witch Project," It was one of the most boring movies that I've ever seen!!
","This movie was one of the most boring movies that I've ever seen!  It had me all worked up about going to  see it when it first came out, but after it was over, I realized that the scariest part about it was that I actually paid to see it!!  Although it was boring, it did have one upside, and that was the ending. The ending really tied in with everything.",2,0,2,15 December 1999
