Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Good if you like somnone mocking the US and rolling on a bed with another man
","It has shock value if nothing else.But the plot scenario is terrible.Simply about pining for Pamela Anderson and going to CA to find her.WOW that story line must have took months to conjure up.If you like someone belittling the USA and making fun of the star spangled banner then you will ike this film.It had its funny moments nonetheless.I cant really say anything else about it.Gays will like it no doubt.When me and my cousin went to see it,there was me and him and two lesbians and that was the extent of it.4 people in the whole theatre.That should tell you something of this films clout.I went out of the theatre thinking... how on earth does a guy like that make it into major theaters in the USA? Go figure!!",3,3,7,7 February 2007
The Dark Knight," Don't believe the hype.not even close as good as Ironman
","Should have been titled The Joker as his character is the only interesting thing in the movie.Hokey fight scenes,Batman talking under his breath in every scene.Plot was typical crap.Joker was good for the most part.The district attorney was a joke,his g/f was sleeping with him and Batman at the same time(this is good ideas to put in our kids minds eh?)This movie got a whole bunch of PR but did not deliver,luckily for the movie creators there are a lot of ignorant people out there willing to pay for this garbage.Christian Bale lowered his integrity as an actor with this one.Ironman and Spiderman 3 are so much better than this its pathetic.If Heath Ledger didn't die during the filming i wonder how many sales it would have made.",2,10,20,13 September 2008
The Departed," I was somewhat disappointed
","Everyone thinks Dicaprio was great in this.I don't.Nicholson helped the movie...however I thought it could have been much better.It took forever for it to get started.Damon in my opinion was one of the best actors.At the end I was left with 'is that it' feeling.Id' much rather see MI3 for a second time than to ever see this lousy film again.To be fair I gave the movie a 6 for Jackie boy's addition.Don't get me wrong I like Scorcese,but this film lacked something,and that was something was script writing.Same ole boring story line,with a twist here and there that can't save the movie from what it is.A bad piece of work for a film.",6,1,3,7 February 2007
Casino Royale," You gotta be kidding!!!
","I went to see this movie based on votes I saw here.Big mistake!!!! It started out good,and went to crap super fast!Super cheesy story line was awful,Don't waste your money or your time.Bond girl co-star was not even that pretty and could not act at all,Wonder how she got chosen for the part at all.Might as well have been watching a cartoon.Terrible plot line watching people play poker,the one good thing was the villain who seemed to have decent acting skills.Bond looked more like a midget than a man.Small guy for an elite spy.Could be voted worst movie of 2006 possibly.Don't go see this movie.See Mission Impossible 3 instead..much better film.",1,8,15,4 December 2006
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," A travesty
","The worst acting,worst scenario,no subtitles,all about screwing your fianc√© around.Can't not recommend this enough,made my head hurt,both mine and my wife.Boring drawn out, not believable at all right from the start.Penelope won an Oscar from this crap?please give me a break already.Music playing through the whole movie with narrator.Lousy cast,even Scarlett Johannason couldn't save it from it self.I was surprised it got as many stars as it did.Total garbage.Yaddda yaada blah blah,GARBAGE,CRAP,LOusy,Junk,Poorly made,only good thing was cinematography,Terrible,Worst,~Crap,Junk Loser,Total garbage.CRAP,CRAP,CRAP",2,2,8,1 March 2009
