United 93," This film is a gift
","A responsible adult carries the duties and trials of his or her world; day in, day out, day after day. When it comes to watching a movie I want to be entertained. I stay away from 'catharsis' movies where you have to feel bad to feel better. Quite naturally I think, I feel better when I smile. I cannot define this movie as either cathartic or entertaining. If it is fair to classify there being a higher level of movie making, this film could be the standard. It brings to life a horrific event and it brings the event home. These figures from the nightly news became real people to me. They became my neighbors. They became family. I felt pride and hurt. I grieved for their loss. It enlarged my heart and reminded me of a resolve I had already made (and too often forget) to be a better human being. This film should not have been rated R. How can a film that should be shown in every high school be given an R rating? One thing that has been hard to shake after seeing this film is how much garbage comes from the entertainment world. I don't think I was aware that a movie like this could be made, but now that I know it can, I want more.",10,1,2,1 April 2007
Unbreakable," Me & the audience I was with were just ordinary folks. So it was okay for us to like the movie.
","I read the 'professional' reviews. They said this was a poor follow up to 6th Sense. Due to a high gullibility level I delayed seeing this movie that I had been highly anticipating for some time. Wouldn't you know, they got me again? This is why I think the professionals were ho-hum about Unbreakable. They didn't like being fooled by Shyamalan's first movie! Oh, they got a kick out of it like the rest of us, but every one of them was secretly upset and ashamed that they were fooled JUST LIKE THE REST OF US. Just like the common folk. The rabble who dare to think the main purpose of a movie is to entertain. 'Certainly, I'm better than the homespun yokels,' they collectively sighed. They couldn't wait for an opportunity to stick it to the guy on round two. So, they did. The fact is, this movie is very good. Very creative. Very likeable characters. Goes unexpected but intriguing places. Great story. Lots of questions and resolves all of them. But most of all- IT'S REALLY ENTERTAINING!",9,0,0,9 December 2000
Spider-Man 2," Movie about man.
","Basically my family had to take me to this movie kicking and screaming because I just don't like spiders. I don't like anything about them. I know we're all suppose to like how they eat all the flies and bugs of the world, but to me that doesn't make them any more attractive. 'Look Timmy! There's a spider near your bed sucking the life out of that fly. I wonder what he'll do when he gets hungry in the middle of the night? Now get to sleep.' So a movie about a Spiderman sounded like it would be the grossest thing of all. And the thought of him sucking on that cute Kristen Dunst was a horror too awful to imagine. But, I went anyway, and I'm glad I did! It turns out that Spiderman is...oh wait. I'm supposed to say there is a spoiler here. So, Spiderman is not really a spider at all. That's just some kind of movie hype. He's really a man who dresses up in a spider suit. Except it's really not a spider suit because it's not all fuzzy and it doesn't have suit fangs. There's no drinking of blood or sucking, in fact, the movie doesn't suck one bit! Oh boy! That's my review; it doesn't suck. Oh, and how about this... this movie's going to be around for a while, it's got eight legs! Oooooo-Ahhhh!",Null,0,0,18 July 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," We didn't see this in I or II, yet somehow it seems so familiar...
","Alternate title: Star Wars.... Use the Force Neo!.... Go Millennial Falcon. Go!.... You can't beat the entire Imperial army!  Or can you?.... They should have brought the twin Wookie brothers back from Reloaded. They'd have fit in so well here.... `Obi Oracle, you're my only hope!'.... Why's it so hard to believe Neo's a Jedi?",Null,0,0,8 November 2003
Van Helsing," 86 proof Hesling
","I thought it'd be kinda fun to write a review while I was totally blotto. Is that the right word? Like, drunk. Because writing a review sober got really dull. So, now I have a beautiful perspective on this Van Hesling mess. And it was a fine mess I got myself into! Like Laural and Hardy, get it! HA! Don't you hate exclamation marks?! They are so presumptuous! And you know what?! This was a really fun movie. It was just like being on a thrill ride that goes up and down and back and forth and round and round...oh boy, I feel like I'm gonna puke. Fortunately I wasn't drunk when I was sitting in my theater seat, which was so much like a thrill ride. BANK TO THE RIGHT! NOW TO THE LEFT! It was just like that. So, if you want a thrill ride, go to Disneyland, or this movie. Or, maybe you like 6 Flags. I like Disneyland's Space Mountain, but it's been closed forever while they are making it into a new ride. It's taking them 3 years to change the best ride at Disneyland. Why don't they just leave it alone and take 3 years to make a different ride? I'll tell you why, because they put all the new rides over in California Adventure! Is that a rook or what?! But fortunately they put all the goodies into just one ride here, called Van Hesling! Like, flying bat women! They are the coolest thing from any movie ever made. And it's a really long movie, so you get your moneys worth even if you buy some bon bons. I've never bought bon bons, but I sure would like to someday. But until then, I give this movie a nine out of ten. Don't you hate it when somebody says they really like a movie but they won't commit to give it a full ten out of ten. Like, 'I'm too cool to give any movie but Citizen Kane ten out of ten because I don't want to lose the respect of all my fans who are just waiting until I write my next review so they'll be able to go to a movie again.' Yeah, so there you go.",Null,0,0,22 May 2004
The Fast and the Furious," NOS is for NObody Sleepin'
","For some reason, I was expecting this movie to be slow and mellow. I don't want to give anything away, but it was really more like just the opposite! If I was watching this at a drive-in, I'd bring my own popcorn. Man, when I left this movie I got in my car and drove home. It's all about quarter mile car races that only last 10 seconds. 10 seconds! And yet they made a 2 hour movie out of this that doesn't let up. That's pretty impressive, and I liked it.",8,0,1,11 July 2001
The Mummy Returns," Good rocks and evil will always let you down.
","Here's the dope, kiddies. Lots of new, interesting plot lines. The movie is a major thrill. The action scenes are creative and very fun. Many gross bug scenes, too. So, you're going to do all right just going for a a good time. However, what I am most excited to relate is you get a whole lot more! Coming away from the movie, what I am most impressed with is it's grasp of honor, love and good vs evil. There is no grey here. True love brings out honor, good rocks, and evil will always let you down. This is displayed with great passion, and it stuck with me. And though I knew the plot lines were just good old make believe, I felt a strong sense these messages were real and true.",9,0,0,6 May 2001
Titanic," This classic, definitive epic of our day, transports us to 1912...
","Engaging story about a large boat. We have quite convincing evidence here that James Cameron actually is 'King of the World.'***********Possible Spoiler*****************Contrary to her seeming sincerity, Rose lets go.",Null,1,2,17 July 2001
War of the Worlds," H. G. Hubbard
","When I got up to walk out about half way through the movie, I only looked back to see if anyone was following me. I left the theater at about 8:00pm Monday, July 4th. I was at the Thousand Oaks mall, which is under a hill where fireworks would be sent skyward in another hour. I walked over to the mall's 4 story parking structure and took the stairs up to the top. They had kept all cars off that level so that families could come and set up chairs and blankets in preparation to see fireworks. There were possibly hundreds of people there, interacting, happy, enjoying each other. It was so peaceful. What a contrast to a movie depicting these same people as a wild mob that would kill each other just to take a ride on an old mini-van. I hated this movie because it was an exercise in frustration. Hopeless, helpless, selfish, panicked people being swept along in the midst of miserable events. To me, that's not entertainment.",1,3,7,13 July 2005
Shall We Dance," Thinly veiled remake of William Shakespeare's 'To Dance or Not to Dance, That is The Question.'
","Movie begins awkwardly, takes a while to find its rhythm, and then just as its movement begins to becomes captivating, it suddenly spins off and falls on its ballroom butt. Gere tries to come to the rescue during the fatal twirl and explains to us (by way of his shrew wife) why after an hour of learning the right moves he's suddenly stepping on the toes of the collective movie audience. Something about loving said wife too much (cue the tear) to ever want her to know that he wasn't satisfied with his perfectly boring life. I personally became mad hot with that explanation for leading a pretty decent movie into the dance hall dumper. Not to be a total naysayer, understated Jennifer Lopez is pretty good in this movie.",5,0,0,3 November 2005
