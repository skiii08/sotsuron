The Ring," The Ring vs. Stir of Echoes
","---Possible Spoiler---Did anyone else notice the similarities between 'The Ring' and 'Stir of Echoes' (Kevin Bacon)? A young girl was wrongully killed years ago. The protagonist is both haunted and driven by the girl to uncover the truth and 'set her free'. In the Ring, the hotel floor is torn up to reveal the well and the dead and decayed girl; In Stir of Echoes, the wall in the basement is torn away to reveal the dead and decayed girl. Also, in the girls in both films both lose a tooth. I'm sure there are others I haven't mentioned as well.",Null,0,0,15 March 2003
