","71' Le mans Steve McQueen vs James garner 66' Grand Prix which one is better?94' the shawshank redemption think of any scene where it could of been better ?
not easyford vs ferrair who is it for... the gearhead or his or HER girlfriend
well you will find some nice moments here but health and safety has crippled the classic car film of yesteryear much like the crippled and maimed stuntmen that made them possible.but what bothers me most is the spotlight on the drama watching this film you cant escape the fact the bad guys win, the crooked bankers don't go to jail and the good guys die, perhaps their real reward.this film is sprinkled with pleasant moments 'shelby flying comes to mind' but i am on this unwanted emotional roller coaster with no payoff.
Not the car film we all hoped for, with a re-edit it could be rescued a little, but this is no cult classic.ford vs ferrari could of been a passable comedy but where it sits now is no mans land, barely re-watchale.but please keep trying to find that automotive masterpiece.
leMans is too much for the gear head much like 71' two-lane blacktop they are phenomenal but finding the perfect car film, now that Ain't easy.For a film about building a racing car and winning leMans, why is the spotlight on unnecessary filler.
throw in some motorbikes and let the every man daydream for a couple hours then BACK TO WORK.your reward watch
No mans land (1987) Charley Sheen
Two-lane blacktop (1971) James Taylor yeah the singer
Dirty Mary Crazy Larry (1974) Peter Fonda R.I.P
White Lightning (1973) Burt Reynolds the goat
The Gumball Rally (1976) Raul Julia
Le Mans (1971) Steve McQueen the film you should watch instead of this.I said, that's life (that's life) and as funny as it may seem

","I remember the first 'it' remake wasnt so bad this is why i went to the second hopeing for a scare, dissapointing more funny then anything, the crazy fortune cookies was the beggining of the end.
I dont know why i didnt like it so much but its been a couple days now and i still catch myself getting pissed off how bad it was.
Too long crap ending stupid monsters, as a gag its not funny enough as a horror its too formulated. Bad film shot well with some comic relief",2,1,1,24 September 2019

","Truely a must watch
Unfortunately i was waiting for a depressing lynching to really cement the white guilt that apears to acompanys most of the films telling a similar tale.
I was pleasantly surprised, a bronx tale meets driving mis daisy
