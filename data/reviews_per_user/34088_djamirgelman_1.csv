Resident Evil: Afterlife," It was a BAD MOVIE! :(
","Okay... It was BAD! It was a very bad movie. When I say bad, I mean it! It's bad alright. It's the baddest ever! I know there's no such word as 'Baddest' but It's BADDD! Very bad. And If you still think this might just be not that bad, then you are BAD for even thinking it!Let's say... ammm... that it was not a bad movie. On that exact moment I made myself very very BAD!I just sneezed myself. You know why? It's because for a slight second I thought it was not that bad of a movie. So god saw this and gave me a flu!In short. It was a BAD movie! Very very very very very... baddd <---- (Infinite)What can be worst? :)",1,2,6,6 March 2011
