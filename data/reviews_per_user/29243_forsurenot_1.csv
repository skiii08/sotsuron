Your Name.," Can't shake off the feeling from movie long after...
","Just finished watching it for the first time, and I wish and feel I am still immersed in it. Emotion took a wild ride and now I am trapped somewhere between the movie and reality.It was beautifully made and very descriptive. It reminded me of my stay in Kyoto when I was younger: peaceful, quiet and pleasant. Also my memories from visiting Tokyo too;it was very busy, full of high rises and everyone were minding their own issues. The level of details from many scenes were breathtaking, having done a little bit of animation really make me appreciate the amount of hard work the artists put into this anime.Then were was the story, starts off as cute and lighthearted, then deeper, and more pure, it takes you on a roller coaster ride, and before you know it, the movie ends.I wish there is more after the ending, but then it wouldn't be a masterpiece. I can only put this beautiful memory from watching the movie in a safe place in the heart and treasure it, watch it again to re live it.",Null,0,1,28 January 2019
