Mission: Impossible III," Predictable Plot but Enjoyable Action
","Just FYI, I hated the first two MI movies starred by Tom Cruise. The first two had terrible plot. The third MI movie yields great improvement plot-wise, but I still guessed who the bad guy was half way through the movie. However, this didn't spoil the enjoyable factors that this flick contains (in fact, judging how it goes, I don't think they care if you guessed who the bad guy is right at the beginning). They've found the right guy to play the protagonist (living up to his Oscar halo), who gave a wonderful performance that convinced me he truly is cold-blooded (I'm a fan now). They've found the right person to play Ethan's wife, too (although not a big name yet, she did a fantastic job, as opposed to in the first two MIs, the main female protagonists were only for show). They've also found the right guys to play Ethan's superiors and partners. The missions carried out were a bit unrealistic and seemed a bit too easy, but because Ethan and his working partners displayed tremendous talents and skills entailed to the idealistic intelligence agents in our ideal minds, plus the right tempo of the action that rise your heartbeat, this is all in all a very good entertainment. Just don't start thinking why the hell things seem so easy for them.",8,1,2,7 May 2006
