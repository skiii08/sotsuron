Walk the Line," Phoenix and Witherspoon are sensational
","Biopic drama about the late country singer-songwriter, Johnny Cash. Structured very much like 'Ray,' last year's biodrama about Ray Charles, the storyline focuses on Cash's early career, up to his mid-30s, the creative period when he eventually achieved fame, culminating in 1968, after his marriage to June Carter and his musical comeback, fueled by the immense popularity of his album, 'Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison.' And, as in Ray, we also get footage sketching in a family-of-origin backstory. In Cash's case, it concerns the accidental childhood death of his older brother, who was favored by Cash's alcoholic father, Ray, at least as told here.Director (and co-screenwriter) James Mangold ('Heavy;' 'Copland;' 'Girl, Interrupted') excels in working with actors, and he succeeds here spectacularly. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, as Cash and Carter, are brilliant, authentic, captivating. To top it off, both did all their own vocals on the Cash songs in this film; Witherspoon also had to master the autoharp. (The day after seeing the film, I listened to some early recordings of Cash's hits. Phoenix's vocal timbre and timing in this movie are stunningly similar to the young Cash's.) Robert Patrick is also riveting as Cash's dour and hypercritical father.The narrative is almost a clich√© of many other musicians' and artists' lives. Early promise and success. Increasing career hassles and pressures. Neglect and disruption of family life. Alcohol and drug addiction. A plunge in artistic productivity and popularity. And then, in Cash's case, redemption, another chance, abetted importantly by his co-performer and eventual second wife, June Carter Cash.Perhaps the story lacks luster precisely because the narrative arc is so familiar, one we've heard so often in varying permutations, that it no longer has legs. The New Yorker magazine critic, David Denby, has written that Cash was an intriguingly complex man, but the nuances in his character are not developed in this film. (One item left out, for example, was that Cash apparently was a community college grad before he went into the Air Force during the Korean War.) If we had been offered more particulars about Cash, the narrative might well have been the stronger for it This movie is at its best when music is being made. In the second hour, there is a long music-free period, when Cash was succumbing to the effects of amphetamines and other prescription drugs, and here the film drags. My biggest beef with many films about musicians (narrative or documentary) is the nervous tendency of the editors to cut off songs midway through a performance. I suppose I should be grateful that the editors for 'Walk the Line' commit this transgression only a few times, and not as ham-handedly as in some other films. Still, with a film length of 136 minutes, there is no excuse for any song cuts at all.It doesn't help 'Walk' that, following the slavish biopic convention (think of 'Pollock' or 'Frida'), we are offered meaningless postage stamp cameos of some of Cash's musical associates and contemporaries (Roy Orbison, Carl Perkins, Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis.) But there are also some small yet very good supporting contributions from others: Dan John Miller and Larry Bagby (as Cash's original sidemen, Luther Perkins on guitar and Marshall Grant on bass), and Shooter Jennings playing his father, the late Waylon Jennings.The parallels with Ray Charles don't end. Like Charles, Johnny Cash achieved no further artistic breakthroughs after his mid-30s. Instead, both men plateaued out and kept doing what they did best for decades to come, making lots of their familiar music and lots of money too. In the end, Charles and Cash both died too soon, in their early 70s. This film, like 'Ray,' doesn't achieve greatness, but Joaquin Phoenix's virtuoso performance, like Jamie Foxx's as Ray Charles, is as good as it gets. If you like Johnny Cash, don't miss this movie!

Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Hilarious movie, in which a Leningrad Cowboy meets Lars von Trier while traveling through America
","The British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen earns his living performing as one of several zany characters of his own invention that pander to ethnic and national stereotypes. His repertoire includes Ali G, a British junglist musician (an electronic musical style featuring a mix of reggae and hip hop breakbeats); Bruno, a flaming gay Austrian fashion reporter; and Borat Sagdiyev, a Kazakhi television reporter, who is the featured character in this crazy movie.It's a road movie in which this oddball guy from another country makes the rounds of America to film a documentary intended to enrich the culture back home, his encounters here highlighting the quirks and contradictions of American culture, to comic effect. Of course this is far from being a new film conceit. Its ignoble predecessors, in varying shades of humor, include Werner Herzog's 1977 film, 'Stroszek'; Aki Kaurismaki's 'Leningrad Cowboys Go America' (1989); 'Road Scholar' (1993), starring Andrei Codrescu; and the recent 'Schultze Gets the Blues' (2003). Mix equal parts of these four films thoroughly and you'd come up with something akin to 'Borat,' though the latter film is a lot edgier: it's got more attitude than the other four combined. Thinking more about the recipe, to get 'Borat' right would probably require that you add in a liberal sprinkling of Lars von Trier's slant on America, as seen in films like 'Dancer in the Dark,' 'Dogville,' 'Dear Wendy' and 'Manderlay.' So much for film comparisons. It's more important for me to report that for fully 85% of the time, this movie just plain rocks with hilarity. I laughed out loud often, not my usual style. In terms of comedic momentum, it does bog down for a while in the second half, though it finishes well. I must also warn you though that the level of humor is unremittingly earthy, full of boyish sexual preoccupations, and also chuck full of racist and misogynistic overtones. It will surely offend many viewers. Borat himself has the sexual temperament of a horny 16 year-old, with judgment and taste to match. In fact he's more like 40, a strapping 6'3' tall, thin and angular. He walks with a shambling, gangly, and at times almost mincing gait. He tries to strike up conversations with men on the street by reaching out to kiss them. He's a guy you notice right off. And probably want to avoid.The film begins and ends in a small, deeply impoverished, rural Romanian village, Glod (means 'mud' in English), standing in for the Kazakhi village that is Borat's hometown. Apparently Cohen, Director Larry Charles and company did not tell the locals how they were planning to use the scenes they shot there, and much later, upon viewing the completed film, a number of the good citizens of Glod were highly displeased, feeling that the film misrepresented, humiliated and slandered them. (See details in the article, 'Borat film 'tricked' poor village actors,' by Bojan Pancevski and Carmiola Ionescu, Daily Mail, November 11, 2006.) Indeed, the folks of Glod are made in the film to appear seriously anti-Semitic, anti-Romany, incestuous, and generally debased. Apparently some Glodians are planning a lawsuit against the film production company.The questionable ethics of the filmmakers have even caused a stir here: it was the subject of an op-ed piece in our leading news daily a couple weeks ago. So what are we to do about a very funny movie made in part at the expense of some unsuspecting participants? Well, the associate editor of our newspaper suggested a boycott of the film. Hmmmm. I suppose that, while the farcical nature of the humor - the exaggeration, comic distortion, hyperbole, whatever - in Borat is absolutely clear and obvious to a viewer like me, it might seem like something quite different, more serious and insulting, to a resident of Glod.Another notion: because of the fragmented, non-sequential fashion in which movies routinely are shot and edited, often even seasoned film actors have little idea what the final product will look like. Directors often prefer not to tell players ahead of time how the details of the story will unfold, how certain scenes, including the actors' own conduct, will be interpreted in the context of final editing. So if the Glodians didn't know how footage would be used, so what? This may seem a cavalier take on the matter. But I cannot, personally, justify putting down or boycotting this wildly funny movie because of the Glodian episode. Maybe Cohen's company should simply acknowledge the hard feelings of the locals and mollify the Glodians with cash. It's all right with me.With Ken Davitian, enjoyably cast as Azamat Bagatov, Borat's porcine documentary film director, and the likes of former Rep.Bob Barr (R-Georgia), perennial Presidential wannabe Allen Keyes, and Baywatcher star Pamela Anderson as themselves.

United 93," Agonizing docudrama of the fate of the fourth plane hijacked on 9/11
","A taut, saddening, intensely realistic docudrama about the fate of the fourth airliner hijacked on September 11, 2001, the one intended to hit the Capitol in Washington, DC, or so we all imagine, but that crashed instead in the Pennsylvania countryside, killing the crew and all 92 passengers, including the four young Islamic terrorists who had seized the plane. Much of the film depicts the increasingly frantic efforts of civilian air traffic controllers and air force emergency response personnel to first comprehend and then take preventive action on that horrid morning, as the saga of four hijackings, and the destruction that followed, unfolded.These scenes are intercut with others inside the cabin, aboard United flight 93, as terrified passengers and crew try to survive and retake control of the plane. What is underscored so effectively is our nation's shocking lack of preparedness for such an unprecedented attack. Adding to the realism of the film story is the participation of a number of actual personnel (air traffic controllers and military figures) who were involved that terrible day, i.e., playing themselves..

Brokeback Mountain," Fresh entry in the canon of American tragic love stories; Ledger's acting turn is stupendous
","Heath Ledger offers one of the finest performances in memory by an actor in an American film as Ennis Del Mar, one of the two star-crossed lovers in this tragic tale of homosexual longing and desire set in the wilds of the Wyoming high country grasslands. Ennis is paired up with Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal), a third rate rodeo cowboy, when the two sign on as sheepherders in the summer of 1963.Their erotic hunger for one another emerges almost immediately after they settle into their routine with the herd in the high country. From their bear cub-like foreplay scuffles, to tender scenes of their kisses and embraces, to the serious throes of their intercourse, the mutual attraction and consummation of lovemaking of this couple are believable to the core.After this summer of love, the men go their separate ways. They each eventually marry, have children, settle down. Ennis stays in a tiny mountain town in Wyoming, barely scraping by as a ranch hand and cattle drive herder. Jack drifts to Texas, rodeoing, where he pairs up with the daughter of a prosperous small town farm machinery dealer, who grudgingly takes Jack in as the lead salesman. Jack and Ennis meet once a year for a tryst, when Jack drives north and the two go off together on 'fishing trips' to the high country where they first had met and discovered their love for one another.What makes Ledger's role so memorable (I kept thinking of his Ennis and visualizing him for days afterward) is not so much his lovemaking, good as it is, but rather the immense complexity of the character he plays. Gruff, rough, moody, surly. A simple but passionate man. At some moments, explosive as a powderkeg. Nearly mute at other times in his inability to express the power of his feelings. Visibly trapped - cornered even - in his poverty. Tender and caring as a father and, to the extent he can muster, as a dutiful husband. Ennis's excitement, his joy of anticipation, is palpable when the moment of Jack's annual visit nears.Gyllenhaal's role is less complex though acted well enough. His Jack is a more garrulous, forthcoming fellow, who wears his needs and his feelings on his sleeve. Unlike Ennis, whose forbearance is huge, Jack does not easily suppress his impulse for homoerotic contacts. He visits male prostitutes in a Mexican border town and begins to strike up what hints to become a relationship with another married man in his Texas hometown. Jack's inability to stifle his impulses proves in the long run to be his undoing.The screenplay by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana was adapted from a short story by E. Annie Proulx. Canada stands in for Wyoming for the location shots. The photography, by Mexican cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto ('Fibra √≥ptica,' 'Amores perros,' 'Frida,' '8 Mile,' '21 Grams'), is sometimes stunning, in particular the sheep herding scenes early on. Director Ang Lee masters yet another film genre here (Westerns) and evokes fine performances not only from his lead actors but several excellent supporting performers, including Randy Quaid, Anne Hathaway, Michelle Willliams, Kate Mara, Roberta Maxwell and Peter McRobbie.This film deserves a proper place among tragic American love classics such as 'Bonnie and Clyde,' 'Casablanca,' 'McCabe and Mrs. Miller,' 'A Place in the Sun,' 'West Side Story' and 'Wild at Heart.'

Match Point," Scarlett Johansson & Emily Mortimer shine in this tale of lust, ambition & luck
","A drama about lust, ambition and luck, this is the first of Woody Allen's urban adventures to be set outside New York City, i.e., in London, and with the exception of one performer, all the actors hail from Britain or Ireland. Chris Wilton (misty-eyed Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is a former lower rung touring tennis pro from Ireland now trying to scrape by. He lands a teaching job at a toney private tennis club, where he is befriended by the handsome young Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), who comes from a wealthy family. Chris comes round the Hewetts' house for drinks and dinner, meets Tom's sweet but marginally attractive sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer), one thing leads to another, and they marry.Meanwhile, Chris has met Tom's fianc√©e, the struggling American wanna be actress, Nola Rice (Scarlett Johannson). For Chris, meeting Nola is lust at first sight. But she is off limits, until Tom breaks up with her in favor of another woman. Now, despite being a virtual newlywed, Chris pursues and impregnates Nola. The narrative then proceeds along a well worn path: Chris must somehow dispose of his predicament without sacrificing his marriage (he does genuinely care for Chloe, never mind the family fortune). Bad things happen. I cannot say more about the resolution without shamefully spoiling things for you.This film is a mixed bag. The basic theme is formulaic. We know it from such classics as 'A Place in the Sun' and 'Room at the Top': poor boy meets rich girl and sees a vision of Paradise on earth. The trouble in 'Match Point' is that the (anti-) hero is not nearly as sympathetic as the principled, brooding Montgomery Clift was in 'Sun.' Rhys-Meyers is frosty, cool, and way too untroubled until close to the end. Nor, on the other hand, does he have the slick, psychopathic charisma that Laurence Harvey mustered in 'Room.' Rhys-Meyers instead comes off as an unconvincing kid, for all the daring his course of action requires, in the same sense that the boyish Matt Damon did not seem up to the title role in 'The Talented Mr. Ripley'; ditto for Leo DiCaprio in 'Catch Me if You Can' and 'The Aviator.' (Regrettably, box office appeal is a very different matter than proper casting.) I thought that Brian Cox seemed lost in his role as Alec, head of the Hewett clan; Penelope Wilton fares better as Hewett's wife, Eleanor. This brings us to the female co-leads. Ms. Mortimer is excellent as the pigeon-toed, plain but endearing, trusting Chloe, strained by her infertility and riffs of disaffection from Chris. She nails the complexities of this role beautifully.Ms. Johansson is simply marvelous. As ever a luminous visual presence on the screen, she also shows once again her impressive range in convincingly inhabiting her characters. Her American girl here is small town coarse, provocatively seductive, and more than a little desperate. How different from her pensive, measured, well-educated, retiring character, Charlotte, in 'Lost in Translation.' And both so different yet from her nearly mute, servile yet perceptive Dutch maid, Griet, in 'The Girl With the Pearl Earring.' Ms. Johannson is not only a rising star, at 21 she is already a splendid actor.The photography and production design are lush. I especially enjoyed the brief scenes shot at Covent Garden, though the operatic theme in general is somewhat mystifying. Is it the affectation of the rich seeming to dig opera that counts? Is there some special significance to the recurring use of ancient scratchy recordings of Caruso arias? If so, Mr. Allen has kept entirely quiet about it amidst his other comments at the film's website. The best things in this movie are its 'luck' theme, its visual delights, and the two female leads. The rest is just OK. My rating: 8/10 (B+). (Seen on 01/18/06). If you'd like to read more of my reviews, send me a message for directions to my websites.",8,4,5,22 January 2006
The Prestige," Rival magicians get seriously vicious in another twisted tale of identity, guilt & redemption from the Nolans, who brought you 'Memento'
","The Nolan Brothers sure know how to mess with a viewer's mind! In their time twister, 'Memento,' a lowlife cannot form new memories after a vicious blow to the head. There the Nolans - Christopher directing and collaborating with his brother Jonathan in writing the screenplay - turned the tables on time (moving backward from the present in overlapping segments), personal history and culpability, as the protagonist uses Polaroid photos and other aids as substitutes for recall in his desperate attempt to find the person that killed his wife and left him badly damaged. I had to see 'Memento' twice to get the complex arc of the thing.Now, in 'The Prestige,' a period film about magic and magicians, set in 1878 in London and Colorado Springs, the Nolans are at it again, messing with time, identity, guilt and me. Things are even more complicated in this maddening, fascinating movie that's part thriller, part melodrama, and part science fiction. And, so, once again, I had to squander precious time and effort, seeing this movie twice in order to get the fine points, often spoken in brief, toss off lines, or visually displayed in tiny fragments, glimpsed for an instant, then gone again.Without entirely giving away the secrets of this film, which would be felonious, I can safely say this much. Two aspiring young magicians become bitter rivals, their increasingly vicious attitudes toward one another fueled by acts that inflict pain and loss for each. The impoverished Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), is an ingenious inventor of tricks but a poor showman. Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), comes from wealth; he's a slick showman but far less creative than Borden.Borden produces a dazzling new stage trick, 'The Transported Man,' in which, within the span of just a few seconds, he disappears through a doorway on one side of the stage, then reappears through another doorway on the opposite side, in time to catch a rubber ball he had set bouncing across the stage before disappearing! The crowds are wowed, and Borden becomes the toast of the town. Angier tries to duplicate the trick, even sending his newest stage assistant, Olivia (a distractingly buxom Scarlett Johannson) to spy on Borden. Instead the sham in Angier's act is exposed by Borden.Humiliated, Angier goes off to America to meet the controversial inventor of alternating current electricity, Nikola Tesla (David Bowie). Angier wants Tesla to create an electrical machine that will enhance his magic show. Angier stays on for more than a year, bankrolling Tesla's problem plagued efforts to produce the contraption Angier desires.Ultimately Tesla's efforts pay off. Angier returns to London and launches a new stage production in which Tesla's imposing device, generating impressive electrical arcs, is able somehow to make Angier disappear from the stage and reappear in seconds high in the theater's balcony. Matters turn decidedly more grim from this point forward: people are killed, or seem to be. In the end justice prevails, or does it? Compared to the manipulation of time in 'Prestige,' 'Memento' seems, well, almost straightforward. In 'Prestige,' we switch back and forth among three timeframes: the early careers of the rival magicians, leading up to their competing 'transported man' acts; the period of ferment and exile when Angier lives in Colorado, then returns to mount his extraordinary new show, employing Tesla's machine; and, finally, the morbid developments that follow, and their resolution.Early on, we receive lessons on the structure of good magic tricks from a veteran London magic man, John Cutter (Michael Caine), who gave Angier and Borden their first jobs. To be successful, Cutter intones, a trick must follow a three step sequence: first, 'The Pledge' (when the magician shows the audience something ordinary), next 'The Turn' (in which the ordinary object is made to do something extraordinary), and, finally, 'The Prestige' (when the audience is shown something shocking that they've never seen before).I think the Nolans have used this formula to great advantage in creating the structure of their narrative: the early rivalry and love interests of the young magicians are ordinary stuff. Tesla's machine surely can transform the ordinary into something extraordinary. And events toward the end, concerning personal identity, guilt and redemption, show us shocking things we've never seen before. So, bravo to the Nolans for their ingenuity.Bale and Jackman perform competently, each displaying impressive range. All three of the men's love interests, are well played (Piper Perabo as Julia, young Angier's wife; Rebecca Hall, as Borden's partner, Sarah; and Ms. Johannson, who manages to insinuate herself as mistress to both men).But the scene stealers in this movie are Michael Caine and David Bowie. It is a treat to see Caine in top form as an understated, wise but world weary fellow who's done it all. His performance has depth and grace, and is achieved with seeming effortlessness. Bowie is a wonderful surprise. His Tesla - displaying a formal, almost stiff manner and cautious, circumspect speaking style, with a splendid east European accent √Ç‚Äì perfectly captures the reserve we would expect of a man who had become the object of international controversy and defamation.'Memento' is daringly complex but its premise holds up well, in part because the Nolans modeled the protagonist's handicap on an actual neurosurgical patient. 'Prestige' is based on a 1995 novel by Christopher Priest that I haven't read. There are continuity problems in the film (see the IMDb's 'Goofs' observed in 'Prestige'). Some of the disguises the two rivals wear to scope out or foil each other's work are way inadequate: if I can spot these dudes in a heartbeat, why can't they? More importantly, I think the movie is overly burdened, made unwieldy, by its complexity. It's surely not a great film, or a ground-breaking one in the sense that 'Memento' was. But, like a well performed magic show, it's still darn good entertainment. My grades: 8/10 (B+) (Seen on 10/28/06)",8,0,1,3 November 2006
Capote," * More tears are shed for prayers that are answered than for those that aren't
","'Capote' is, so far, the best American film of the year 2005 (though 'Good Night, and Good Luck' isn't far behind). It is an arresting docudrama about the eccentric author/celebrity Truman Capote that focuses on the period when he obsessively investigated the slayings of a prosperous small town Kansas family by two low level crooks and then wrote his magnum opus, 'In Cold Blood,' about the killers and the killings. Capote called his book, published in 1966, a 'non-fiction novel' and predicted, with his typical flair for immodesty, that it would be highly influential. It was. Indeed, it established a new hybrid literary-journalistic genre, and, for a time, made Capote the most well known writer in America.Philip Seymour Hoffman, one of the busiest and most versatile actors working today (25 films in the last 10 years), further demonstrates here the immense range of which he is capable, transforming himself - as if somehow he had literally shrunk his rumpled, stocky, 5-10 frame - to become the diminutive Capote. His performance goes well beyond the physical illusion of petiteness he creates.As Oregonian critic Shawn Levy puts it, Hoffman gives an '...uncanny impersonation of a man famous for his squeaky voice and catty manner¬ÖHoffman is note-perfect. The wheezy laugh, the pain of work, the prying nature, the cold eye, the self-obsession, the ability to perform and ingratiate and wheedle - it's Capote you're watching up there, not some actor doing an impression.' The screenplay is brilliantly conceived. Rather than the conventional, slogging biopic approach, in which we would have been led through Capote's entire life to show us the man (who died of complications from alcoholism in 1984, just short of his 60th birthday), instead we get just a five year slice. But it's enough. Pitted against an equally complex man, the murderer Perry Edward Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.), the further reaches of Capote's deeply convoluted personality are mobilized and thus revealed.Beyond the qualities Levy catalogs, we see Capote's arrogance and vanity, his shocking capacity for manipulation and disingenuousness (Capote just plain lies to Smith at times), and yet also the intriguing juxtaposition of both callous indifference and seemingly genuine tenderness toward the murderer (though the latter quality could be explained simply as a narcissistic gesture, self love extended outward by means of projective identification). Capote is willing to abandon all scruples to get the information he wants from Smith, but he also seems, at least some of the time, to care for the man.All of that said, this movie is not simply a showcase for Hoffman's talent. It is a fully rounded drama in which both the structure and the acting ensemble shine. Collins, as the killer Perry Smith, is often a match for Hoffman's Capote: by turns chilling or vulnerable, but for the most part quietly opaque, Smith is literate, soulfully melancholic, quite possibly even lovable for Capote. Their relationship provides the core of dramatic tension.Fine supporting turns are offered by Chris Cooper, Bruce Greenwood, Mark Pellegrino, Bob Balaban, and, especially, Catherine Keener (as the writer and Capote's 'research assistant' Harper Lee). (Lee and Capote were lifelong friends and childhood next door neighbors in Alabama. Lee's own classic novel, 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' was published in 1960, during the period covered in this film. It is virtually indisputable that the character of Atticus Finch's young son Dill in her book was modeled after Capote. Now 79, Lee, like Capote after 'In Cold Blood,' has not published another novel since 'Mockingbird.') Technically, 'Capote' is splendidly crafted in every sense. An amazing facet of the film's realization is that the director and screenwriter brought almost no prior experience to their tasks. The screenplay was adapted by Dan Futterman from a 1988 book, also called 'Capote,' by celeb biographer Gerald Clarke. Futterman heretofore had been a film actor in small roles but hadn't written a screenplay.Bennett Miller had directed only one previous film, the 1998 documentary 'The Cruise,' about a quirky Manhattan tour bus guide. Miller and Futterman were high school classmates, and both were also boyhood friends of Hoffman's. Hoffman had not sought out this project, but was invited by his friends to consider it.In contrast, the cinematographer, Adam Kimmel, and the editor, Christopher Tellefsen, are veterans of their trades. They rely on close-ups in the contest of wills between Capote and Smith, and exchanges between Lee and Capote, but otherwise establish a good mix with middle distance shots of characters in conversation. The camera is always steady, the shots assured. Now and then, as if to add a further note of sombreness, there are long, wide, silent, utterly flat prairie horizon shots, silhouetting dark tree rows in the far distance (Manitoba stood in for Kansas). These occasional scenes are bleak, wintry, foreboding but also starkly beautiful.For those interested in background reading about Truman Capote, I suggest a volume of first hand observations of the man, compiled by the late George Plimpton, entitled 'Truman Capote, In Which Various Friends, Enemies, Acquaintances, and Detractors Recall His Turbulent Career' (New York: Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, 1997). Having thought about it more, I would rank Capote among my 200 all time best films (a mythical list that, for all I know, is up to 400 films by now). My rating: 9.5/10 (A) (Seen on 10/22/05). If you'd like to read more of my reviews, send me a message for directions to my websites.* One of Capote's favorite aphorisms, he took this saying, attributed to St. Teresa of Avila, for the title of his novel, 'Answered Prayers,' that was published posthumously, in 1986. Capote had his prayer for lasting literary fame answered with the success of 'In Cold Blood,' but the project seemed to have left him virtually a wreck for the rest of his life.",10,3,4,7 November 2005
The Devil Wears Prada," So-so Hollywood fare, but 2 thumbs up for Streep and Tucci
","If you can tolerate the silliness heaped within in the first half hour or so, this comedy/drama settles down after that and becomes quite watchable. And it is a fabulous vehicle for Meryl Streep, who will undoubtedly receive an Oscar nomination for her turn as the acerbic, tyrannical editor of the leading women's fashion magazine in America, an executive who scrupulously lives out Teddy Roosevelt's dictum to walk softly and carry a big stick.The plot is simple enough. Andy Sachs, (Anne Hathaway), a freshly graduated journalism star at Northwestern, comes to the Big Apple to seek her fortune as a writer and lands a job as an assistant to Miranda Priestly (Ms. Streep), the Queen of Hearts in fashion journalism. Andy struggles to please the unsatisfiable Ms. Priestly, who seems to quietly relish every opportunity to break everybody's balls on the premises. In the process Andy loses the affections of her friends and lover. When she has passed all of Priestly's sadistic little tests and gained a promotion to top assistant, she finally is in a position to see her boss's foibles in a clear light, and we know in a flash that redemption lies just around the corner.The silliness early on is twofold. First, Andy comes to work looking like a college freshman dorm rat, oblivious to proper dress and grooming standards for work at a fashion mag. Nuh, uh. Sorry. If she's as smart as touted, she would not be that clueless. Her subsequent instant makeover into glamour queen merely underscores the stupid conceit of her initial frumpiness. Second, when the call comes in that Queen Priestly is arriving early for work (the point at which we first meet her), everyone on the staff ¬ñ and there are scores of people ¬ñ frantically dashes about cleaning up the trashed mess of paper, coffee cups, and general disarray so all is pristine when the Queen arrives. Again. Nuh, uh. Never happen. If Priestly's demand for decorum is that fierce and exacting, the place would never suffer the entropy we witness for even a moment.These conceits are old fashioned, ham-handed Hollywood stuff. Scenes you'd never see in a European treatment of the same story. Scenes that cheapen an otherwise decent movie. With Adrian Grenier as Andy's boyfriend and Stanley Tucci as Priestly's chief designer, the best thing I've seen him do since his role as Secondo in Big Night. Hope he gets a supporting Oscar nomination. (The English actress Emily Blunt is miscast here as the assistant Andy displaces¬ÖBlunt acts well enough but lacks the glamour for this role.)

Little Miss Sunshine," Fresh, zany comedy about a dysfunctional family on a road trip
","Here's a comedic road movie featuring a stereotypical dysfunctional family that is very funny. The predicaments these people find themselves in, and the solutions they come up with, are blatantly far fetched, and the characters are all amusing caricatures of people we've known. There's the sullen teenage son who refuses to speak (Paul Dano, who was so effective in 'L.I.E.'); the grandfather, a sex obsessed old man who snorts heroin (Alan Arkin); the sensible, long-suffering Mom (Toni Collette, whose acting range keeps on expanding); her suicidal brother (Steve Carell, who played the '40 Year Old Virgin'); the Dad (Greg Kinnear), a failed motivational speaker whose rhetoric about winning and success is at deliciously ironic odds with his own ineptitude. And there is Olive (Abigail Breslin), the plain, plump yet altogether winsome younger daughter, who longs to enter the 'Little Miss Sunshine' kids beauty pageant.The family's journey to the contest, from Arizona to Redondo Beach, forms the main scaffolding on which this wonderfully silly farce is hung. This is the debut feature for the co-directors, whose previous collaborations were on music videos and a six minute short comedy.

Jarhead," A 'good enough' movie about military life
","Anthony Swofford's highly literate 2003 memoir of his days in the Marine Corps, including service as a sniper in the first Gulf War (Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm), gave this film its title and substance. 'Jarhead,' as nearly everyone must know by now, is slang for a Marine grunt: it refers to the look of the requisite 'high and tight' haircuts and also to an image of the new soldier as an empty receptacle for indoctrination. 'Jarhead' is a good enough film, but is far from being a great one.Swofford's memoir was a decidedly interior book, a narrative about the impact of military training and the threat of war on the soldier's sense of identity, about the resulting intense emotions of self doubt, fear and rage, and the indelible killer instinct training presses upon the soldier. Swofford is interested in the combatants' inner life, their souls. His book is an existential essay on the soldierly experience. Since films are all about action and exteriority, not reflection and states of mind, the prospects for a decent adaptation of a book like Jarhead thus seem dim from the outset.I realize that it's tedious and trite to complain when a film adaptation of a novel or memoir differs substantially from the book. We're supposed to judge a film on its own merits, not by comparison to its source. But when a film adaptation does not quite hit the mark, sometimes the reason becomes more clear if you turn to the written source. Actually, because films are about action while books are typically about thought and feeling, few adaptations can be entirely faithful to their sources. Of course there are examples, the grand exceptions, where books are adapted well for the screen, but the whys and wherefores of these successes is a whole separate subject. Just to name two recent ones, though: think of Michael Ondaatje's 'The English Patient,' adapted for the screen by Anthony Minghella, or Annie Proulx's 'The Shipping News,' adapted by Lasse Hallstrom and Robert Nelson Jacobs. My reason for taking the risk of boring you to death here is to point out that this film's great flaw is precisely that so much is lost in translation from the page to the screen. Because existential reflection has to be jettisoned in favor of action for this film, the core of Swofford's powerful writing is lost and we end up with just another movie about military life.In the boot camp sequence up front we're reminded of Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket.' In the monotony of daily life in the service we pause to recall the drunken boredom of the soldiers in 'From Here to Eternity.' Gripped by the fear that accompanies waiting to encounter a faceless enemy, we think of Vietnam, of films like 'Platoon,' or the Russian film 'Checkpoint,' about the Chechnyan War. Sam Mendes even helps us conjure such reflections by having his grunts whoop it up watching 'Apocalypse Now.' But, like I said, it's a pretty good picture. We follow Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal), his best buddy Alan Troy (Peter Sarsgaard) and a handful of their mates as they endure training, then a painfully long and idle deployment to Saudi Arabia, and, finally, brief and utterly surreal combat. We see a few scenes from a later time as well, back home, a gathering to mourn the loss of one of the guys. The acting all around is solid. Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard are especially good, as is the ensemble of their buddies, especially Evan James, Lucas Black and Jacob Vargas. Jamie Foxx evinces some serious swagger as the hard-edged Staff Sergeant Sykes, who leads the sniper contingent on the desert. Mendes, a young Brit who came from stage work to film, is smart: he hires top filmmakers to help him. In 'American Beauty' he enlisted Conrad L. Hall, and his son, Conrad W., to photograph and Thomas Newman to write the music. For 'Jarhead,' Mendes engaged Roger Deakins ('Shawshank Redemption,' 'The Big Lebowski') for his DP and Walter Murch as editor (Murch edited 'Apocalypse Now,' 'The English Patient' and the 'Godfather' trilogy, among many others), and Mendes again used Newman and also Tom Waits to create the score.So, between the talented acting and the craftsmanship on display here, 'Jarhead' is well worth your attention. If you want the existential part, read the book. My rating: 7.5/10 (low B+). (Seen on 11/13/05).

The Chorus," Uplifting! Puts a smile on your face! A wondrous breath of fresh air
","THE CHORUS (Les Choristes) (Christophe Barratier, France/Switzerland/Germany, 2004, 96 min.). Brilliantly crafted, absorbing tale of the transformative power of choral music and a resourceful teacher to achieve civility within the confines of a dreadful state lockup school for deviant and unwanted boys.The story is told in a long flashback, when a reunion occurs between two men who were in the school together a half century earlier. As their story is recounted, we first meet Clement Mathieu (Gerard Jugnot), a short, balding, failed musician who in middle age has no other prospects than to take a job as supervisor in the prison-like school, run by a sadistic martinet, Rachin (Francois Berleand), who treats his faculty as viciously as the students.The ensuing plot conceit is a familiar one: the steadfast Mathieu gradually wins over the insolent, anarchical kids through music and kindness, as he introduces a choir program to brighten the otherwise dull, steady diet of the three 'R's' and the punishments meted out by Rachin.This little gem has been a surprise hit, wildly popular both in France and internationally. The choral numbers are sublime, performed by an established French boys' choir, whose soprano soloist, Jean-Baptiste Maunier, sings flawlessly and acts the role of young Pierre Morhange, a central figure among the youths here.The film is a remake of a 1945 movie, 'La Cage aux rossignols' ¬ñ 'A Cage of Nightingales.' First time writer-director Christophe Barratier was himself a musician: beginning musical studies at age 7, he also sang in a boys' choir, and later studied at the Paris Conservatory. He is the nephew of Jacques Perrin, the well-known actor and film producer ('Microcosmos,' 'Himalaya,' 'Winged Migration'), who here plays the adult Pierre Morhange, now an internationally known conductor, one of the two men who meet at the start of this film to reflect on their experiences long ago.The story is not far fetched. I have personally known of situations in which participation in choral music turned around the lives of troubled teenagers. Amid so many films reflecting indifference, destitution and violence in our world, this one comes to us like a wondrous breath of fresh air. (In French). My rating: 8.5/10 (A-) (Seen on 04/16/05).

Garden State," After Woody: The comedy of neurosis has a new talent
","Fresh, tender, quirky and genuine, the adjectives just want to pour forth to describe this marvelous romantic comedy/coming-of-age story. First time writer-director Zach Braff also stars as Andrew, a 25 year old, marginally employed actor in LA who returns home to New Jersey for his mother's funeral.Andrew hasn't been around his old friends or seen much of his father since he was sent off to boarding school at 16. Several disparate forces move Andrew now to rethink his life. The film concerns these developments that will reshape his future. The first, of course, is the death of Andrew's mother. We never meet her but learn that she had been rendered paraplegic years earlier, when she fell in the kitchen, after being pushed by an angry 9 year old Andrew.Plagued by poorly controlled emotions after that (what kid wouldn't be?), Andrew was placed on medications to blunt his moods by his psychiatrist father (Ian Holm, in a minor role), and had remained emotionally numbed by meds for the past 15 years. He was dispatched to boarding school for the same reason, we also learn, to decompress the emotional angst in the family household. Amazingly, we are informed of Andrew's past without resort to a single flashback.Dissatisfied with the course of his career and life in LA, Andrew decides to stop taking his mood stabilizing medication upon learning of his mother's death. Back in the suburb where he grew up, reunions with old chums now contribute to Andrew's unfolding self reappraisal.More importantly, he meets Samantha ¬ñ Sam (Natalie Portman), an inquisitive young woman who seems to care about and accept him from the getgo. In the end it is the budding romance with Sam that catalyses Andrew's resolve to change his life. But this could not have occurred without him freeing himself of the enormous burden of guilt for causing his mother's paralysis, a burden only made worse by his father's misguided 'treatment' of Andrew's non-existent mood disorder and his virtual banishment from the family. He confronts his father about these matters in one of the film's more moving scenes.Among several reasons why this film works so well, perhaps the most important is the lack of schmaltz. There is not a single note of over-the-top melodrama or pathos here. No shouting or screaming. We are never insulted by any belaboring of the obvious psychological nuances in play. Braff writes with respect for the intelligence of his audience. Many little scenes and plot twists delight because they are unexpected gifts. The off key pop solo sung by Andrew's aunt at Mother's funeral. Various people living in odd circumstances. One old buddy got rich selling his invention of soundless Velcro and now trundles down the corridors of his unfurnished McMansion in a golf cart. Another buddy, Mark (Peter Sarsgaard), sells jewelry he acquires in a highly unusual manner. Braff also writes simple yet refreshing dialogue, with plenty of offbeat humor, yet none of it is strained, nothing is played self-consciously for laughs.Braff himself has a warm, easy-to-watch screen presence. He can say nothing during the lull in a conversation, while the camera remains focused on his face, and it feels right. Portman and Sarsgaard are also genuine, each wonderfully relaxed in their roles. Production design is superb: details in every scene are arranged well, and the photography, by Lawrence Sher, is - like the story and the acting ¬ñ unpretentious, never distracting, tricky or cute. This film never seems to manipulate us; instead it engages us, arouses our curiosity and amusement, bids us gently to care about Andrew and Sam and even Mark, leaving us entertained in the best sense. This movie is as confident, as secure in itself, as comforting, as a well worn pair of house slippers or your favorite reading chair. A splendid film. My rating: 8.5/10 (A-). (Seen on 09/09/04).

"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Pity the media that need heroes
","Skillfully prepared docudrama about the fateful confrontation between broadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow and Sen. Joseph McCarthy in 1954, when Murrow was the first major media commentator to take McCarthy to task for his unscrupulous and enormously damaging witch hunt tactics while chairing a Senate committee investigating communists in government and elsewhere.Clooney and his colleagues made a brilliant decision to shoot in black and white (shades of gray, really) and use enhanced archival kinescopes and television footage of McCarthy and his hearings - rather than recreating these scenes using an actor (who on earth could even come close to portraying McCarthy's evil presence?) - juxtaposed with newly shot material depicting the acted roles of Murrow (by David Strathairn) and other prominent figures at CBS TV at the time.Virtually the entire film takes place within the news department studios or occasionally at a nearby bar where the staff relax. This is a film about the intense work and sweat of a big network TV news staff in that era, informed by two consultants to Clooney who were part of the team that worked elbow to elbow with Murrow, Joe and Shirley Wershba (played in the film by Robert Downey, Jr. and Patricia Clarkson).Another brilliant touch is having the jazz singer Dianne Reeves perform several songs from the era, numbers whose lyrics are often, ironically, in touch with the issues being depicted in the film.Strathairn, who has made a career of performing quality supporting roles in 70 films since his debut in 1980 in John Sayles's 'Return of the Seacaucus 7,' gets his chance to shine in a star turn here and makes the most of it. He is entirely convincing as the chain-smoking, dour, principled, hard hitting, eloquent Murrow. Ray Wise gives an outstanding supporting performance as the emotionally frayed Dan Hollenbeck, a CBS newscaster and prot√©g√© of Murrow's who was accused of being a communist by a newspaper columnist and eventually committed suicide.Frank Langella is properly dyspeptic as CBS boss William Paley, whose backing of journalistic freedom in his news department proved to have significant limits when Murrow went after McCarthy. Clooney casts himself as Murrow's producer, Fred Friendly, and does a decent job of playing down Friendly's famed aggressiveness, instead sharing his many scenes generously with the other players. Downey, Jr., Clarkson and a pudgy Jeff Daniels are put to dubious use playing other characters who were apparently important at CBS news at the time but are not written well into this screenplay (prepared by Clooney and Grant Heslov).The film is on target, resonating keenly with our times. Murrow remarks early on, when he goes after McCarthy, that dissent should not be mistaken for disloyalty in a free society. Shades of all those post-9/11 debates. Not since the McCarthy era have civil liberties been as broadly threatened as they now are by the U.S.A. Patriot Act, military prisons and tribunals, and other restrictions put in place in the name of security against terrorism. Clooney, a liberal activist and the son of a television newscaster, slugs away at these issues: his film has been criticized for being overbearing in this regard, though I did not feel preached to.'Good Night' also offers an important critique of television itself, by way of a prophetic vision that Murrow offered in a 1958 speech to news broadcasters, recreated scenes from which are shown at the beginning and end to frame this film. He said then that TV seemed to be approaching a crossroads, a conflict between its role in public education versus shallow entertainment. The bruises left after his falling out with Paley over the McCarthy programs obviously had not healed. Murrow chided network bigwigs for sitting complacently while the medium is 'being used to detract, delude, amuse and insulate us.' Two years later he was out of TV altogether, working as chief of the USIA, having been appointed by John Kennedy.Forty seven years on, Murrow's prophesies about television have for the most part come true. Today television and radio are corrupted by a legion of shrill, bombastic cheerleaders for the right, while our more dispassionate, serious media journalists (print and TV) have frequently seemed either craven or muzzled in not pursuing egregious problems brought on by the Executive branch and Congress.The only downside to the film, apart from the acting talents wasted here and there, is its highly focused, clich√©d Hollywood emphasis on the 'big showdown' between the good guys and the bad guys. It's a reductionistic, somewhat dumbed down account. Phillip Lopate, writing in 'Film Comment,' recently observed that '...Clooney's smug recasting of Cold War issues as a simple matter of decency versus intimidation fudges the film's politics. We never do learn whether Murrow was a member of a Communist front organization involving international education in the Thirties, as McCarthy claimed...To what degree was Murrow's 'taking sides' dictated by his own personal politics?...What does (Clooney) make of the influence of Stalinist Russia on the American Left at that time, and whether it held any possible danger or was entirely illusory?' Say this for the good guy - bad guy formula: it does get the juices flowing. I was spellbound watching this film. And we do need to be reminded of the truths told here, which hit harder in a two hour movie if not too freighted with nuance.Bertolt Brecht famously said, 'Pity the country that needs heroes.' He meant, of course, that a yearning for great leaders - past or future - is all too often a sure sign of a nation foundering in a current leadership vacuum. Pity the media that need heroes, as well. It is apposite that Clooney at this moment offers his reflection on Murrow, surely a media hero for all times. My rating: 8.5/10 (A-) (Seen on 10/16/05).

Blood Diamond," Leo DiCaprio plays a soldier of fortune who discovers morality
","Based on the trailer, I really didn't expect much from this movie ¬ñ lots of action maybe but not a whole lot more. Wrong. It's a good enough flick, long on action to be sure. But, beyond that, based on what I've read, it is a more-or-less accurate depiction of circumstances during the on-again-off-again civil war that played out in Sierra Leone from 1991 to 2002.During that terrible time, hundreds of thousands of ordinary peasant citizens were slaughtered and exploited by armed rebel militias, principally cadres of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), and also by government forces supposedly charged to protect these folks from the rebels. At the very least, many people found themselves lethally caught in a no man's land between the RUF and the Army. Refugees piled out of the most hotly contested areas and into holding camps.The film narrative takes place in this context of violence and chaos. Danny Archer (Leo DiCaprio) is a renegade gun merchant and adventurer from Zimbabwe, on hand to make a buck selling weapons to the RUF. His love interest is American journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) but there isn't really any time for love or lovemaking between attacks in this Hell on earth. So one unexpected plus in the film is the downplaying of romance in favor of another form of bonding and fidelity. For that the partner of interest is not Bowen but a Mende tribe peasant fisherman, Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou).Vandy's village and family have been torn asunder by the RUF, who kidnap Vandy's young teen son Dia (Kagiso Kuypers) and turn him into a killer. An RUF cadre leader, nicknamed 'Capt. Poison' (David Harewood), serves as Dia's mentor and father surrogate, supplying political guidance and, ironically, almost tender approval for Dia's increasingly brutal soldiering. Vandy himself is indentured by the RUF and supervised at gunpoint working on a crew of prisoners busily extracting diamonds from a jungle patch to finance the RUF cause.Vandy escapes, he and Archer are unexpectedly thrown together, and, when Archer learns that Vandy has buried a gigantic diamond back in the jungle, he becomes Vandy's best buddy ever, vowing to lead Vandy to his family and the diamond, profits from which they will split. The trio of Archer, Vandy and Bowen plunge into an intensely contested battle zone, and the action sequences commence in earnest.It's a match made in Heaven: Vandy and Archer, that is. They manage their characters' roles and increasingly interdependent relationship with great skill. I think DiCaprio has been growing lately into a first rate adult actor, based on his work here and in the recent Martin Scorsese film, 'The Departed.' He's bulked up physically and seems to have matured into manhood in his last two films.At age 31, when these recent films were made, he's no longer the troubled kid of 'Basketball Diaries,' the unconvincing slick operator kid in 'Catch Me If You Can,' nor does he seem miscast as an adult, as he did in 'The Aviator.' Granted, his characters in 'The Departed' and 'Blood Diamond' have much in common: in both DiCaprio is four parts whip smart toughness and one part tender vulnerability. But the point is that he has grown into such roles and performs them with aplomb.The film suffers towards the end when Archer single-handedly takes on a huge RUF contingent plus a government attack force that Archer himself had called in on the rebels' stronghold. It's a page from Sly Stallone's book of go-it-alone guerrilla warfare. Having worked so hard and effectively to build a credible character capable of moral transformation, DeCaprio doesn't deserve this fatuous Hollywood fate. I do suppose that this one-man-standing-against-the-world-of-evil baloney sells theater tickets and DVDs. Sigh. Beyond this insult to our intelligence, the film is edifying, exciting and believable.

Pride & Prejudice," It may not be recognizable as Austen's work, but it's a good enough movie
","Competently crafted period movie by British first time feature film director, Joe Wright. Jane Austen's novel was adapted for this production by Deborah Moggach, with additional uncredited rewriting by Emma Thompson. Overall, the acting and the photography are good, and the movement of the story proceeds briskly enough that the 2 hour-plus running time does not feel tediously long.I am not well versed on Jane Austen, so I leave the question of fidelity to the text to the more knowing hand of critics like Jonathan Rosenbaum (writing for The Chicago Reader), who finds that this adaptation has 'hopelessly mangled' Miss Austen's work. Be that as it may, the movie holds together reasonably well. The costumes and production design are good. The scenes at the ball are especially well done, with good camera movement and a stimulating mix of details and broader shots.Donald Sutherland is highly pleasing to watch as the patient, wise English country squire, Mr. Bennet, who, though he aspires to marry off all of his five daughters in order to ease the burdens of his old age, wants them nevertheless to be well and happily matched, not just gotten rid of to the first bidder, as his well meaning but overly anxious wife (Brenda Blethyn) tends to want to do. Matthew MacFadyen is frightfully dour as Elizabeth Bennet's love interest, Mr. Darcy. But then his longstanding betrothal to the mentally disturbed daughter of Lady Catherine de Bourg (Dame Judi Dench) is reason enough to make a grown man down in the mouth.Keira Knightley is a pleasant surprise here as Elizabeth. I hadn't expected her to carry much weight in a serious role. But, apart from one bad habit, she does a reasonable job throughout, holding her own opposite the grave Mr. MacFadyen. The habit is a wretched, squirrelly little grin: it's more of a grimace, really, all closed teeth framed by thin, squared off lips, a grin like a car's grille, an unbecoming facial gesture that I hope some drama coach eventually will convince her to drop. Simply openinging her teeth would do wonders. My rating: 7.5/10 (low B+). (Seen on 12/19/05).

The World's Fastest Indian," Formulaic docudrama; a star vehicle for Anthony Hopkins
","Formulaic docudrama about Burt Munro (Anthony Hopkins), an aging New Zealand eccentric who dreamed of setting a land speed record for small motorcycles. In 1967, he got his wish, journeying to the Bonneville Salt Flats with his jerry-rigged 1920 Indian motorcycle, where he did get the record he coveted. Munro returned to Bonneville for the next eight years, setting additional records, at least one of which still stands.Unfortunately, this overly long movie is awash in nostalgia and lacking in suspense. It also features a dreadful supporting cast, either indicating a budget set too low, faulty directing, or both. We have here nothing other than a star vehicle for Mr. Hopkins, and he does a nice job, getting the accent right and showing plenty of pluck. But the movie is too much of a burden even for his broad shoulders. My grade: C+ 5.5/10.",5,2,10,2 June 2006
The Fountain," Cheesy mysticism and an implausible love story make for mediocrity
","Aronofsky's long awaited third feature is a bloated, ungainly, pretentious excursion to nowhere in particular. The film is billed as a love saga about the same two people (Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz), played out in three stories spanning 1,000 years ¬ñ past, present and future. That's quite a laugh, since there's plenty of evidence that Jackman's character, Tom, is only capable of self love, pushing his agenda of violence, inattention to his wife, and bullish pursuit of his research, playing by his rules alone.Tom's misbegotten roamings into time travel, parallel worlds and reincarnation are overwrought and largely incomprehensible, especially scenes from the future story in which Tom sits lotus style alongside a gnarly old tree, inside a giant bubble, floating around outer space among lurid animated montages, as if part of some New Agey detergent ad.The proceedings in 'Fountain' recall films like 'The Illustrated Man' and Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey.' But those films at least were adapted from works by good storytellers: Ray Bradbury ('Man') and Arthur C. Clarke ('2001'). Unlike 'Fountain,' 'Illustrated Man' is a convincing love story. '2001' is¬Öwell, I'll resist going off on that tangent for the moment. 'Fountain' was written by Aronofsky and Ari Handel, and the screenplay is not well constructed. (A graphic comic book version, written by Aronofsky and illustrated by Kent Williams, was in fact spawned by the film.) Why is it that otherwise sensible people can sometimes be so thoroughly bamboozled by the cheesy, showy varieties of mysticism served up in films like 'Fountain?' We see this in the enduring cult adoration of Kubrick's film. More recently we saw it again in the acclaim given to 'What the Bleep Do We Know?', a sophomoric infomercial for a religious cult up in Yelm, Washington. Are we simply curious about the paranormal? Or does our materialistic, overly politicized culture breed a hunger for the spiritual and mystical? Conversations with smart friends who fall for these puffed up films convinces me it is the latter.Aronofsky's first film, 'Pi' (1998), was brilliant: the taut, claustrophobic, plausible story of a mathematician's descent into delusion and paranoia. His second feature, 'Requiem for a Dream,' was messier. An aging woman gets addicted to diet pills trying to become more attractive, while her son and his girlfriend live a heroin junkie life together (in a fashion derivative to earlier, better works like 'Drugstore Cowboy'). Aronofsky's definitely not proceeding in a desirable direction.The best two things in 'Fountain' are certainly not the principal actors, whose turns are undistinguished (though Aronofsky favorite Ellen Burstyn does a nice cameo as Tom's research supervisor). Nor is it the high tech, high cost animated montages making up the nebula in which Tom's detergent bubble floats about.One good thing is a brief, stunning dance scene in one of the flash forwards to the future, when a dark figure makes slow movements against a starlit but otherwise blackened sky. The other is the pock marked, ferocious Mayan Chieftain in 1535 who looks and acts every inch an ancient bigshot. (In English & Maya) My grades: 5/10 (C) (Seen on 12/22/06)",5,4,9,24 December 2006
The Departed," Scorsese in familiar territory: guerrilla warfare in the urban jungle. Terrific acting except for Nicholson's lazy turn
","Martin Scorsese returns to the milieu he knows best: guerrilla warfare in the urban jungle, only this time the setting is south Boston ('Southy'), not New York City, and it's Irish ghetto dwellers, not Italians, that claim his attention. All of which is vaguely amusing in light of the fact that Departed is a remake of a 2002 Hong Kong crime flick, 'Infernal Affairs,' adapted from the original script by William Monahan, a Boston Irishman himself.The plot line is as reminiscent of John LeCarre as of Mario Puzo. It's all about spying. The Boston city police suspect that Southy gang lord Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) has planted a mole inside their criminal division. At the same time, Costello's people have been tipped that the police covert crime unit might be running a spy, an undercover agent who has infiltrated their gang. In fact, both rumors are true, as we learn early on. But wait a minute. Things aren't THAT simple: there seems to be a spy behind every other lamppost in this shoot 'em up thriller. And Scorsese pays all due respect to the Hong Kong provenance of this story by liberally splashing blood and knuckle sandwiches around like holy water.Scorsese has also gathered a fabulous cast, and for the most part he orchestrates their turns to great effect. Matt Damon (playing Colin Sullivan) and Leo DiCaprio (as Billy Costigan) are the principal spies, and both sizzle: they're tough as shoe leather, quick as tigers. This is the best work I've seen from DiCaprio in ages: he's maturing, he's bulked up, he's convincingly tough yet just vulnerable enough to be intriguing, as well. Scorsese makes more than sufficient amends here for miscasting him as Howard Hughes in 'The Aviator.' Another wonderful surprise is Mark Wahlberg's strong work as the garbage mouth, in-your-face Sergeant Dignam, aide de camp to the chief of the undercover unit and Costigan's leader, Oliver Queenan, who is more than ably played by Martin Sheen. And that's not all. Alec Baldwin also shines as Ellerby, chief of the crime unit, Damon's boss. Then there is Brit bad guy extraordinaire, Ray Winstone, never more menacing than he is here as 'Mr. French,' Costello's right hand man.That leaves us with only a couple of less admirable turns to confront, one of which, I regret to report, is presented by Jack Nicholson, who sleepwalks through this film playing the role of, yes, himself, Jack Nicholson. We get the shambling gait that has attended his increasing corpulence in recent years. The rolling up of the eyes, the arching of the brows, the acid toss off comments, the devilish, naughty little smirks that can explode into either a violent attack or a hearty guffaw.But it's all old hat: Pr√™t-√†-Porter, off-the-shelf, stock Nicholson. And for that reason I find his turn here distracting, like, how did this aging, frumpy, lovable Hollywood actor become enmeshed in a taut crime story¬Öhe better watch out, he could get hurt. He doesn't need a hip fracture at his age. I defended Nicholson in 'About Schmidt,' when a number of critics said he was too big a star to play such a character role, i.e., too much Jack, not enough Schmidt. But I can't defend him here. Come on, Jack! You can do better. Start surprising us, for Heaven's sakes. Earn your money. Be a dog that is willing to learn new tricks.However canned his performance is, you can never accuse Nicholson of offering a weak turn, but you can sure indict Vera Farmiga on this charge. Her Madolyn is a psychiatrist who ends up having professional and unprofessional contacts with both young spies, Sullivan and Costigan. The screenplay demands that she face a hopeless fate: as a lover, she is ambiguous and lacks passion; and as a shrink, her sense of boundary issues approaches that of an amoeba. As the lone woman among this pack of seriously felonious cops and crooks, she all but disappears. If I were Ms. Farmiga, I would replace my current agent within the next 30 minutes, before he steers me into another suicidal casting blunder.This rough and tumble gangster stuff is done in the stylish, grand Scorsese manner; he's at his best directing entertainments like this one (think of 'Mean Streets' and 'Goodfellas'). And if the moral point seems to be that there isn't much difference between cops and criminals, why that's hardly news. For years psychological researchers have demonstrated such an affinity in the personality makeup of these two groups of adversaries. Like any good Hong Kong crime movie, this one may not teach us anything we don't know already, or transport us to any new destination, but it's sure a thrilling ride.

Glory Road," Classic sports flick: underdogs triumph and strike a blow against southern racism
","Fine feel good docudrama about the Cinderella team that shocked the collegiate sports world in 1966 by coming from obscure underdog to win the NCAA basketball championship against the legendary Adolph Rupp's heavily favored Kentucky team. The important subtext here is that in building his winning team, Texas Western coach Don Haskins was the first coach in the South to recruit black players.His team came from inner city ghettos in Detroit, South Bronx, and so on. In the championship game, he fielded a starting lineup that was all black, against Rupp's all white players, a first in college basketball history. Of course, in the north, things had been different for years: Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain had dominated college basketball in the 1950s and led the pro sport in the 60s.But in the deep south, and Haskins and his players had to endure one hate-filled encounter after another. All of this, plus other problems (players' personalities, health and academic woes), are depicted here. Josh Lucas is splendid as Coach Haskins. Lucas appears to have graduated from the Paul Newman School of Acting. His face in profile is like Newman's, especially the bridge of his nose, but, even more, Lucas's head tilts, confrontive stares and manner of touching his face with his hands are about as Newmanesque as you can get.But that's all right. Lucas makes these gestures his own in a good turn. With a very old looking Jon Voight as Adolph Rupp. Be sure to stay through the end credits to learn the fates of the players and coaches. This film is a purely formulaic sports success movie, but it is very well done indeed. My grade: low B+ 7.5/10",7,2,4,1 June 2006

He is an extremely hard worker, having participated in 66 film and television acting projects over the past 25 years; and in that span he has produced and directed films as well. Among his performances, I highly esteem his Charlie Parker in Clint Eastwood's 1988 docudrama, 'Bird,' for which he won a Best Actor award at Cannes, and his role as a self styled Samurai assassin in Jim Jarmusch's 1999 film, 'Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai.' Splendid as those performances are, they pale in comparison to his personification of the Ugandan dictator, Idi Amin, in this docudrama about Amin and his relationship with a young (fictional) British doctor, Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy).Amin, a fatherless youth from a dirt poor family, became a Ugandan Army officer trained by the British and later President from 1971 to 1979. If you wonder how megalomaniacal a character Amin was, just dig the title he is said to have once bestowed upon himself: 'His Excellency President for Life, Field Marshal Al Hadji Doctor Idi Amin, VC, DSO, MC, Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Sea, and Conqueror of the British Empire in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular.' He idolized Scotland, often wore kilts, and also dubbed himself with the title used for this film (also the title for the novel written by Giles Foden upon which the film is based.Regarded in the West as a buffoon, Amin became an increasingly dangerous and destructive tyrant over the years, perpetrating ruthless oppression against various ethnic and religious groups, Asians and Jews in particular. Estimates of the numbers slain by his regime vary from 80,000 to 500,000.But Amin was not a simple fellow, certainly was no fool, and his initial rise to power seemed to derive from genuine populist sentiments and ambitions. Power, however, as we well know, corrupts. Amin's conduct in office darkens over time, and we see the changes. Whitaker's interpretation has Amin by turns eloquent, charming, visionary, ebullient, and, increasingly, arrogant and paranoidally hostile. If Amin was a man of extreme passions, appetites and mood swings, then Whitaker has nailed the man cold. It is an incredibly energetic, astonishing performance.I wish I could say as much for the rest of the cast and narrative subtexts. But strip away Whitaker, look at the scenes and subtexts in which he is absent, and there's little to see but a soap opera. The Garrigan character is based a real man named Bob Astles, called 'Major' Bob, a former British soldier who, according to Foden, inveigled himself into Amin's favor and became part of his apparatus of repression. British newspapers used to call Astles 'Amin's White Rat.' After Amin's fall, Astles was imprisoned for ten years in a Kampala jail.James McAvoy is a charming, impish, natural comedian. He was terrific as a mischievous paraplegic in the irreverent 2004 comedy, 'Rory O'Shea Was Here.' McAvoy's strength as Rory is his downfall here: he's a bright eyed comedic twit miscast as a seriously ambitious and substantial personality. He's not believable: it defies all sensibilities that Amin could take him seriously, much less make him a close adviser.And, like Rory O'Shea, McAvoy's Dr. Garrigan is easily distracted by attractive women he has no business chasing. He tries valiantly to seduce the Medical Director's wife at the health outreach clinic where he's originally assigned. Later he manages to bed and impregnate Amin's youngest and most attractive wife, Kay (Kerry Washington), right under Amin's nose. Yeah, sure. I'd almost say Garrigan got what he deserved in the end. Not a good idea to cuckhold a murderous African tyrant. Who would be so stupid as to try? My grades: 6.5/10 (low B) (But an A for Whitaker's performance.) (Seen on 01/25/07)",7,1,4,28 January 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," Zany story built of nonsense that is very funny if you don't analyze the plot
","A delightful confection made of pure nonsense, this romantic comedy features an outrageous screenplay, by Zack Helm, that rivals the zany imaginings in Charlie Kaufman's scripts for 'Being John Malkovich,' 'Adaptation' and 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.' Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) is a gangly, nerdish bachelor IRS agent who is obsessed with numbers (his favorite word is 'integer'), a math savant who can solve complex arithmetic problems instantly in his head. His most prized possession is a hi-tech wristwatch. Every one of his daily routines involves split-second timing to save up the minutes for¬Öwell, nothing in particular, since his life is utterly sterile, devoid of friends and interests.One day Harold's pristine world is invaded¬Öby a voice, a woman's voice, a voice with an English accent that narrates his every move as he makes it. Try as he might, he cannot shake the voice. He consults a shrink (Helen Hunt, in a fine little cameo in which she assures him he has schizophrenia); he takes a vacation, but nothing works. Finally he consults a literature professor, Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), after someone suggests that he may somehow have become a character in a novel being written by the woman whose voice has begun to ordain his conduct. Hilbert asks a bunch of questions to try to discern a pattern that would allow him to accurately peg the identity of such an author.In fact the notion that he is a character in a novel proves to be true, and the novelist in question is the celebrated Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), who has been suffering through an agonizing case of writer's block in pursuing her new manuscript about¬Öyes¬ÖHarold Crick, of course, the bachelor IRS nerd. She's stuck trying to find a way to kill him off (the protagonist in every one of her highly successful books dies). The publishers are so concerned as Eiffel falls further and further behind the deadline for completion that they send over their in-house special assistant/baby sitter for blocked authors, Penny Escher (Queen Latifah), who tries to soothe the agitated, chain smoking Eiffel and pull her through to success.The other pivotal character in this crazy yarn is the woman who becomes Harold's unlikely love interest: Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a casual, tattooed, New Agey bakery owner who at first glance seems to be everything Harold is not. He only meets her when her case of underpaid taxes comes up for audit and is assigned to him. They form an intense mutual dislike at first, but all of that gradually changes.So how is this weird predicament going to be resolved? Where does life leave off and fiction begin? Life emulating art emulating life, and so on. Is Harold inexorably doomed to whatever fate Eiffel has in store for him, assuming she can break through her block to have anything at all in store? I'll leave you with these existential questions to mull over. If you see this film, prepare yourself in advance by repeating at least 100 times: 'I will not suffer trying to make any sense of this story; I will simply yield to its pleasures.'

The Good Shepherd," Superb, intense account of the inception and early years of the C.I.A.
","Superb pseudo-docudrama using fictitious characters and narrative to represent a more-or-less accurate account of the origins and early operations of the Central Intelligence Agency (C.I.A.). Matt Damon assumes a role against type here, as the carefully meticulous, self-controlled, colorless protagonist Edward Wilson, who is a pivotal higher up in the CIA in the 1950s and 60s. His devotion to family and to his job inevitably leads him into crises of priorities and conscience for which there are no satisfactory solutions.The other subtext of importance is the pervasive sense of distrust that overtakes Wilson and everyone else in the agency. Who's spying on whom? Who in the agency is a double agent? Is the Russian spy who flips actually the fellow he claims to be? Damon offers a brilliant turn, one in which he sheds the whip smart cockiness we saw in his characters in 'The Departed,' 'Good Will Hunting,' and 'Rounders,' among other roles, in favor of a plodding, depressive, burdened yet resolute character, just the traits one might expect in a principled man who carries the shame and responsibility associated with his father's suicide years earlier.The rest of the superb cast are also fascinating to watch, including fine turns by Alec Baldwin, William Hurt, Michael Gambon, John Turturro, Billy Crudup, John Sessions and DeNiro himself. Mr. DeNiro can take credit for evoking these uniformly excellent performances. Angelina Jolie, as Edwards' wife Margaret, is left behind in this fast company, adding only ornamentation to the proceedings. My grades: 8.5/10 (A-) (Seen on 12/29/06)",9,3,6,3 January 2007
The Queen," Here's a film for my all-time top 200 list!
","It's still early innings, but Stephen Frears's The Queen is definitely going on my short list for best film of the year, and it will stay there. It's a flawless, burnished production, a virtually perfect film. This glowing, suspenseful docudrama retells the story of the days of upheaval in London and elsewhere, in 1997, shortly after Tony Blair had just won for Labor, by steering clear of trades unions and welfare statism, while flogging his 'let's modernize Britain' program, window-dressing for his Clinton-like political shift to the right.Then, on August 31, Princess Diana, recently divorced from Prince Charles, was killed in a high speed auto accident in midtown Paris. The film's story turns on how various echelons of British society reacted following Diana's death. Dramatized are many vignettes that bring together the major personalities at the center of the highly public dilemma that unfolded in the few days following Diana's passing.Helen Mirren was, as they say, born to play Queen Elizabeth II. In every tableau, in every body movement, in every nuanced shift in feeling she conveys to us, with or without words, she is simply majestic. But this movie is far more than a showcase, a star vehicle, for Ms. Mirren. Each of the major supporting players, portraying some prominent person, is superb. Besides The Queen, we have The Queen Mother (Sylvia Syms), Prince Philip (James Cromwell), Prince Charles (Alex Jennings), Mr. Blair (Michael Sheen), and their respective retainers, playing out at close range their responses to one another, within the framework of a taut cultural and political crisis, one that is, above all else, a threat to public support of the Monarchy.This drama takes place in an enervating, though also suppressed, emotional atmosphere, the tension level constantly ratcheted up by the principals' responses to pressures from the public and the press. (Of course the accuracy of the depictions is open to some question at least, and, in addition, there is the insurmountable problem that no one knows for sure the full truth about many of the rumored conversations -discussions that might or might not have transpired among these people - that are dramatized here. It is fair to say that the actors have magnificently sculpted their characterizations to fit the common perceptions of these celebrities in the public eye.But there's more: I haven't yet touched on the main reason that I think this movie will be considered a classic decades from now. That is it's overarching subtext, not about individual personalities, but about a deep change in the very fabric of social custom signaled by events after Diana's death, especially in Britain, but also in the U. S. and other 'anglophilic' 'developed' nations. The point is made crystal clear in the film: Elizabeth's seemingly callous aloofness from the public in the wake of Diana's death is the result of her conviction, based on her upbringing, that duty must come first, that stoicism is the face one shows the world, while personal feelings are an entirely private matter, hence not to be aired in public. One must soldier on. Stiff upper lip. The English way.According to this film narrative, Queen Elizabeth makes a serious miscalculation when she fails to consider, or perhaps even to perceive, the fact that the terms of public discourse - perhaps especially with regard to the open expression of personal sentiments - have changed radically around the world. Frank disclosure of personal feelings and issues once considered taboo for public consumption, emotional 'witnessing,' and even mass catharsis, have for many become the norm, displacing public stoicism, in response to poignant events. We know this from many lines of evidence, of course: confessional literature and film; the outpourings of personal tragedy and conflict on 'Oprah' and a host of clone television and radio shows, and so on. But the Royals' cloistered existence very probably has always shielded them from accurately gauging the pulse of popular societal changes.Never in recent times had there been such a worldwide wave of acute public grief over the loss of a single person, perhaps not since John Kennedy's death, as was the case of Diana, whom so many admired, revered, indeed, loved, even if from afar. The Queen documents with brilliance and power this major sea change in societal conventions, a shift that historians will undoubtedly look back upon as one of the most important and influential quakes in the tectonic annals of civil conduct.

Tombstone," Too few good turns, too few good moments, in this long, long film
","The Earp brothers take on the Clanton gang, redux, in this muddled, overly long remake of 'Gunfight at the OK Corral.' The classical themes of old west lawlessness and threat of death are well displayed, but intruding upon these is an updated psychologizing theme that seems out of place as well as boring.Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp spends a lot of time staring blandly into space. He is dignified, give him that. But he looks too much like a preacher and not enough like a killer with a badge. Burt Lancaster was better cast. Ditto for the Clanton gang, all tricked out here with red sashes, like some step dance troupe. Give me John Ireland and Dennis Hopper √Ç‚Äì both were Clantons in 'Gunfight' - any day over the acting ensemble playing at bad guys here.On the plus side, Val Kilmer is superb as the dying, mannerly Doc Holliday, way better than the perpetual ham, Kirk Douglas. And Sam Elliott is picture perfect here as Wyatt's brother Virgil. There were production problems on this film. Cosmatos was brought in to direct a month before the shoot, after Kevin Jarre, the screenwriter, who was supposed to make his directing debut here, was sacked. And Jarre's screenplay is dull, too inactive, too long, especially the second hour. (Gunfight, on the other hand, moved well and was written in part by the great action novelist, Leon Uris.) My rating: 5/10 (C). (Last seen on 11/12/05). If you'd like to read more of my reviews, send me a message for directions to my websites.",5,3,7,19 November 2005
Casino Royale," Daniel Craig can be a good tough action character, but as James Bond, he's no Sean Connery
","The highly capable actor, Daniel Craig, certainly shows here that he's got the chops to be a brute of an action character. He belongs in a French noir gangster flick. He's wasted, or, perhaps more accurately, miscast in this bloated, overheated remake of the original James Bond movie. The 1967 version of Casino Royale starred David Niven: too urbane and fragile. Craig is raw and rough edged: he can take anything and dish it out as well, but suffers from lack of suavity. Sean Connery effected a proper balance between acting the thug and the worldly aesthete.I grew weary after 90 minutes watching this film. It isn't so much a bore as an insult to the intelligent viewer. It offers scenes in two modes: (1) mile-a-second action, with over the top, not to be believed, inchoate chases set to wild orchestral paroxysms with added loud percussive thumps. It plays like an action comic strip. When this mode is inoperative, we instead get static close encounters between characters that are burdened by banal, dull dialogue.Sean Connery was never banal. He had a knack for injecting a flicker of humor or sexual arousal at just the right moments. The problem here is perhaps in part bad writing and in part Daniel Craig's take, playing Bond for the heavy. With Mads Mikkelson and Isaach De Bankol√© as bad guys, Dame Judi Dench as M, Giancarlo Giannini as M16's man in Montenegro, Jeffery Wright as Bond's CIA counterpart, Felix Leiter, and Caterina Murino, Eva Green and Ivana Milicevic as glam interests.

Munich," Failed opportunity to illuminate Palestinian terrorism; instead we mainly get James Bond redux
","Docudrama about the Israeli-sponsored counter-terrorism team assembled (with the blessings of Golda Meir, Israel's Prime Minister at the time) to retaliate against the Palestinian terrorists and their co-conspirators responsible for slaying 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team and staff at the 1972 Munich Olympiad. The screenplay - by resident Broadway genius Tony Kushner and Eric Roth, who also wrote 'Forrest Gump,' 'The Horse Whisperer' and 'The Insider' - is based on a book by George Jones, entitled 'Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team.' Ever the entertainer, first and foremost, Steven Spielberg gives us no insights about the causes of Palestinian or Islamic terrorism, but, rather, a high intensity, slick action movie on the order of the James Bond flicks. We even have a bomb maker who creates too cute, one of a kind, overly gimmicky devices tailored unnecessarily for each assassination, just like the lethal toymakers in the Bond stories. (Maybe it really happened that way; my point is, why did Spielberg dwell on such techie details when there were more weighty issues to address?) The pace is fast, and as the team take out one anonymous, one dimensional bad guy after another, with ingenious methods and plenty of risk-based tension, I could not resist being caught up in the excitement of blood sport on display here.As for more serious geopolitical subtexts, we do get misgivings expressed about the whole notion of revenge embodied by this team - an eye for an eye, Talion Law, the Code of Hammurabi, the raison d'etre for their lethal mission. Occasional doubts about the mission do furl the brow of the serious minded Avner (Eric Bana), recruited from within Mossad, Israel's CIA, to lead the team, but only in passing. His ambivalence seems easily patched up. The bigshots behind the mission ¬ñ people like Mrs. Meir (Lynn Cohen) and the team's Mossad supervisor, Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush) ¬ñ have no doubts at all that history and God are on their side.The other four team members are an interesting lot, but we really don't get to know them all that well, even in the expanse of 2 hours, 44 minutes film running time. The chief trigger man, Steve, is played by a coolly psychopathic, baby blue eyed Daniel Craig (Ted Hughes in Sylvia; the latest actor to be anointed for the James Bond series role). Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz) is the bomb maker, recruited for this task because of credentials that are at best equivocal: he was formerly a toy maker and bomb dismantler. Turns out that some of his devices are too powerful, causing collateral damage. Carl (Ciaran Hinds) is an expert in obliterating evidence, traces of the team members' identities. Hans (Hanns Zischler) is a master document forger. The group wine and dine their way around Europe in elegant circumstances between assassinations, another Bond-like touch, however true it may have been.A fascinating side story here concerns a Paris-based Mafia-like family that indulges in espionage and other dirty tricks for hire. Avner contacts a son, Louis (Mathieu Amalric) and pays handsomely ($100K per person) for information on the whereabouts of people the team wants to take out. Louis eventually takes a blindfolded Avner to meet the family's leader, Louis's father, called simply 'Papa' (Michael Lonsdale), a stout avuncular fellow who takes a liking to Avner that stirs jealous sentiments within Louis. The world of this amoral French crime family would serve as excellent fare for expanded treatment, perhaps in some other film.Just in recent months we have witnessed an rapidly emerging and maturing cinema of contemporary terrorism ('The War Within,' 'Paradise Now,' 'The Friend,' 'Syriana'), to which 'Munich' adds something, but not a lot. To be sure, the violent practice of Talion law still dominates relations between Israel and Palestine. And, at one point in the film, Louis plays a fiendish little trick on Avner and his mates. They are put up in a safe house in Arab territory, Yemen as I recall. Late in the evening, in troup another gang also instructed to use the same safe house. They are Arab terrorists. A long, tense, guns-drawn moment ensues, but the situation is defused when Avner's team passes itself off as a leftist German terror cell (think Bader-Meinhoff or Red Brigade). An intriguing discussion between Avner and the Arab team leader follows, about the historic inevitability of their causes. The Arab leader says that Islam will prevail against the West, even if it takes 100 years.This is one of the film's best scenes. But much of 'Munich' seems like a throwback, a film that would have been more timely in the 1980s perhaps, but less so now. The hit team's targets are people we never meet or learn about only superficially. We don't know why they did what they did to contribute to 'Black September.' It is unfortunate that with the immense resources at his disposal, Mr. Spielberg could not have reached for something less showy, more edifying to our understanding of the dynamics of contemporary terrorism. My rating: 7.5/10 (low B+). (Film seen 01/09/06). If you'd like to read more of my reviews, send me a message for directions to my websites.",8,2,3,22 January 2006
