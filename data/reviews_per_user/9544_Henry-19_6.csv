Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," About what I expected
","To us old time S.F. fans the joy of the first Star Wars film was to see on the screen what we had read about in books for years at last visualised. At the time we were blinded by the stunning effects which set a new standard. Now many years later, after so many special effect movies we have perhaps become jaded with just SFX and look for a film that contains a good storyline allied with good acting. Unfortunatly The Phantom Menace was not this type of film other than the stunning effects the film in general dissappointed.There were so many flaws that mounted up to spoil ones enjoyment.
1. George Lucas' direction was very poor. It seems that he is more concerned with the technology behind the film than such incidentals like acting and pace. Maybe it would be better if he stuck to producing and let someone else handle the more artistic side.2. This leads to my second crib, the acting. Never have I seen such poor performances in a major film. Liam Neeson seemed to treat the whole thing with contempt and just went through his lines without any expression or feeling. Ewan Mcgregor spent all his time trying to sound like Alec Guinness that he forgot to act. As for the rest of the cast, with the possible exception of Ian McDairmid, they didn't register at all.3. The humour was forced and unfunny. The audience I was with barely chuckled. 4. The Aliens, very well done I admit but still unconvincing. Jar Jar (Hate Hate) looked and acted like Goofy. In fact I thought most the Aliens looked like Disney characters.5. Did we really need another Death Star, or substitute, to blow up at the end?6. The sad underuse of Darth Maul who seemed to be disposed of so easily after all the buildup. He could have been a classic character like Darth Vader.Enough flaws, did I like it? In a way I did, the Pod Race was superb though clearly based on the Chariot Race in Ben Hur and there were some stunning visuals.For the future though, I think that George Lucas should stick to producing and SFX, get actors who don't treat the thing with disdain, don't over rely on SFX, and don't pander to the kiddies. Also try and cut down on the hype and merchandising. I'm getting a bit fed up with Star Wars characters facing me everywhere I look when I go to the Supermarket.",6,0,1,8 August 1999
Aliens," Performance in the film and behind the scenes
","This is a wonderful film because it was directed well, had an excellent story and a brilliant cast.  Bill Paxton and Michael Biehn brought out their best for this movie.  It was full of action and it always has everyone on the edge of their seats.  This also is the best Alien film because Ripley is shown as a stronger and more caring character.  10 out of 10.",10,1,2,25 October 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Saving Private Ryan, almost a masterpiece.
","Over the last 20-odd years Speilberg has provided us with some of the most memorable moments in the cinema. From Jaws through Close encounters, E.T. Indiana Jones and most of all Schindlers List. Now he has added another milestone, Saving Private Ryan.This film in the first half hour must come as close to showing the full brutality of war as anything ever seen before. Despite an occasional soggy middle section, in the opening sequences he fully makes up for any short comings that the film may otherwise  have.With his track record now, I await the time when he makes his true masterpiece and ditches his more saccharine elements. In the meantime there is still plenty to appreciate.P.S. I liked Amistad as well!",9,0,0,14 October 1998
Groundhog Day," Deja Vu
","I,m sure I've seen this film before. It was even better the 2nd time, the 3rd time, the 4th time and on and on and on.HAPPY GROUNDHOG DAY!",10,0,0,1 February 1999
The Truman Show," Rave
","Marvellous. As a Jim Carrey hater, I found his performance in this  film to be a revelation. I doubt if he will ever better this performance and will sadly return to his normal sort of role. Praise to Peter Weir for his inspired direction. Definitely my film of the year.",10,0,0,13 October 1998
Gladiator," Great
","Loved this film, but then I would as I used to do  (almost)all the films set in the ancient world that, I saw many years ago, when I was a lad.
I know there are a lot of historical inaccuracies inthe film, but that didn't bother me, after all this  is a movie not an history lesson. Anyone interested in the period and the real events can find plenty of books that will shed light on it.The plot was basically a remake of 'The Fall of the Roman Empire'(much underrated)with elements taken from 'Ben Hur'(hero loses everything and is thrown into slavery) and 'Spartacus'. Despite this the film works, due to the  superb visuals,the incredible action sequences, the fine acting, and the inspired directing of Ridley Scott.May this heralded the return of the Epic Film!",9,0,0,8 January 2001
