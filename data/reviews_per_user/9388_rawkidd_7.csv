The New World," Too less
","I was looking forward to that movie. Not only because Colin Farrell is playing some sort of character he really handles well, also I hoped to lose myself in a sweeping story and picture.First of all: The real annoying soundtrack. It starts in the opening scene, where these discoverers are arriving. Goodness, who decided to put this weirdo-sound into this movie ? I think it is one of the worst sound i've ever heard in a movie.The story respectively the dialogs are brain-dead stupid insomuch. Although i've tried hard to sympathise with any character, i didn't make it. I just couldn't. There is nothing personal in the story, nothing captivating. The pictures look not bad, since they often return some kind of hidden mystery, but it is too less.It is boring, annoying and just a dumb waste of time and money.",3,1,5,20 March 2006
Iron Man 3," What Special FX can do
","Well, one thing must be said: The Trailer fully served the producers goal: Drag as many as possible people into the theater.Like a lot of people already said: Iron Man 3 is fully packed with CGI, VFX, XYZ but has everything else than a compelling story or such. I don't want to spoil anything but come on, this is all you can do with a fantastic cast? By the way: Robert Downey Jr. needs to go over the books when it comes down to choosing the next movie roles because while making a fortune with these popcorn movies he dangers himself by losing role credibility. Why? In my opinion these kind of movies don't require acting skills very much this is Downey Jr.'s 4th appearance in the Iron Man series (Avengers included) so I tend to think he's choosing roles or movies that make him tons of money but don't challenge him as an actor.Anyway, I think you really have to be an Iron Man fan in order to spend your money on this. I went to see this because of the horrible weather on a Sunday afternoon. And this is, what the movie does best: it distracts you from something annoying.",3,1,3,26 May 2013
John Wick," I'm disappointed big time
","It's good to see Keanu back on the silver screen but unfortunately this film wasn't his best choice. If you're into shooting, killing or 'one man against the rest of the world' then this is for you. The movie reminded me of 3rd person shooter game, not only because John Wick moves like a game figure, also because there's seems to be a certain range of skills he uses to bringing the bad guys down.If you're into thrill, story or dialog: simply forget about it, there's nothing like that in this movie. The plot is so weak, I think you hardly can call it a plot. It's rather a 'cause and effect' thing. You did me harm, so I'm gonna do you harm too. That's it.What I liked the most about the movie was it's cinematography and style and that actually kept me watching until the end. The CGI is OK, although in some scenes (shooting from close range) too obvious.All in all, I found this movie very disappointing and I think it's more a huge budget B-Movie.",3,18,38,14 January 2015
Hotel Rwanda," So Great
","Besides the story is so well told, it was Don Cheadle's acting which makes the film so great. Watching this film is witnessing mankind's virus of hatred. But nevertheless, real hero's don't wear a red cape with a golden S on their chest. Or costume themselves in red/blue body-tights with spider design. Nor they command young people to a country to bring them western democracy or peace. Hotel Rwanda is shaking, thought-provoking and mainly great piece of filmmaker work. Which does not mean, that this picture should be seen as entertainment, because it's simply not.It's really hard for me to write about technique, screenplay or storyline, because the movie almost is a documentary about those horrible happenings down there in 94. Bravo, Don Cheadle ! Bravo, Sophie Okonedo ! Bravo, Terry George !And everybody who gave their best in this movie to make the world a little bit more clear, that we cannot turn our eyes away or consume just news on TV, as it were just a show.",9,0,0,4 January 2007
Clash of the Titans," Just ridiculous
","Yes we're living in times of the 3D hype. Animated flicks made the start a few years ago, then Avatar dragged it to the top and now a bunch of wanna be 3D movies use this hype. Having said that let's go back to Clash of the Titans.I don't want to start comparing this remake with the original one because I think that every decade has it's advantages and disadvantages and a comparison does no good. But let me tell you this. CGI is not everything in a movie and Hollywood has to comprehend this finally. This movie has awful dialogs and the story is super porous. I mean come on a guy who was fisher all his life fights like a superhero. OK you might say he's the son of Zeus and a demigod but then again, why couldn't he save his family from drowning in the beginning. Sam Worthington surely is the Shooting-Star after having appeared in blockbusters like Terminator and Avatar but if he isn't careful in his role choices he'll end up where all these wanna be action stars from the 80's have been categorized. You know I don't even want to list all the leak of this film but after 20 minutes I was bored to death and regretted badly I spent my money on this waste of time. Clahs of the titans is the worst movie I've seen this year so far. I definitely do not recommend it.",1,4,5,12 April 2010
Into the Wild," Storytelling by pictures
","This movie is a great piece of work and art. I was so touched by the story which mainly is being told by the pictures, I enjoyed the dialogs between Chris and the characters he meets during his way to Alaska. Especially the friendship between him and the old man (Ron) is very moving.What I liked most on this picture was this clear, non-Hollywood point of view. And this makes INTO THE WILD very real. And at the end of the movie, when the real Chris (photo) is being showed you're getting closer to him and feel sorry (for him), anger (against his stupid Dad) and think, 'oh man, this can't be true'. But it is.Sean Penn and his people did a great job and have my respect once again.",8,2,5,25 March 2008
Sherlock Holmes," What a disappointment
","I've been a Sherlock Holmes fan since my childhood days. I've read the books and watched the movies. I won't be telling you which movie or book was best etc. I just wanna say, that this film just ain't about Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. In this movie you're going to watch two men, one is very eccentric, most of the time some sort of tiddly, a fighter and wanna be brilliant mind, the other is snobbish, violent, vain and some sort of male model of those days. Now, here's the question: Does that sound like Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson ? I'm sorry to write these lines but they transformed these two characters into action heroes, trapped in old London and put them in a long-winded story. I really like Downey Jr. and Law a lot and they do a good job but the movie is total waste of time and money. It is too long and the pace is too slow. Boring, dinky and spare.",3,3,8,1 February 2010
