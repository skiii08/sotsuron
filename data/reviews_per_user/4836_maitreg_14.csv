The Blair Witch Project," first 50 comments vs the rest
","The most unusual thing about these comments is that almost EVERY one of the first 50 are very positive, while 99% of the rest are very negative. Strange phenomenon.  It's also strange that the vast majority of those first 50 are by users who have not commented on any other movies.  Users with only one comment are very rare and for the majority to be represented by them throws up red flags all over the place.  I sense a conspiracy here, not by IMDB, but most likely by individuals who stand to profit from the success of this piece of garbage.  Will this comment ever make it to the comments page? Time will tell :)",1,4,9,20 June 2000
Casablanca," Overrated
","I'm not quite sure why so many people like this movie.  It must be from decades of being told by the media that it's a great movie.  But it's very hard to 'enjoy' it.  I could not connect on an emotional level to any of the characters.  I got the feeling the director was trying to create sympathy for Bogart's 'Rick' but it's hard to feel anything for a self-abusive, chauvinist, murdering, adulturer who never sees the error in his ways.Every character except Peter Lorre's 'Ugarte' is a cliche and overacted. Hollywood could only have gotten away with this in 1942.  If anything this silly was produced today, it would be laughed right out of the theatre and onto video in a just a few weeks for being so unbelievable and ridiculous.And what does 'Here's looking at you, kid.' even mean?  It's just another stupid, catch-phrase that has no real meaning.Maybe this movie's popularity was related to the anti-Nazism of the time.  I don't know.  I wasn't around then.  Whatever it is, I don't get it.",5,8,19,16 January 2002
Erin Brockovich," Julia Roberts' best movie
","This movie may have changed my opinion of Julia Roberts.  I have never like her acting, and the media's portrayal of her as some sort of beauty queen in the 80's (and she has never been a very attractive woman) only made it worse.  But she did an excellent job in this story, seemingly portraying the real Erin Brockovich with perfection.Great story, maybe a little hard to believe though if you didn't know it was true.  But everything was very well done.  All the characters were good. One bad thing is that they seem to have cut some scenes out to speed it up? Some of the scene transitions were downright bizarre and there was no logic behind.  But other than that, no real complaints.One thing I'd like to point out to people before they watch this is that Erin Brockovich is not a very likable person.  She's profane, crude, obnoxious, rude, and treats everyone around her, especially those who are better educated, like garbage.  She always had trouble finding and keeping a job and she always blamed it on her lack of education and experience.  That wasn't it.  It was her attitude.",7,7,9,19 February 2001
Meet the Parents," Some of it is funny
","Some of this movie is very funny, but most of it is just plain cruel and doesn't deserve a chuckle.  Ben Stiller plays Greg, the soon-to-be fiance of Pam (Teri Polo), who's just meeting her parents for the first time.  Her parents, especially her father (Robert De Niro), not only reject him, they treat him like a piece of unwanted garbage.  Personally, I would have just walked out after the first five minutes with the parents and never would have seen her again.  I wouldn't WANT to marry into a family as arrogant as that.  But anyway, Greg spends an entire weekend with the in-laws where NOTHING goes right for him.  This is an obvious take on the the first sequence of 'There's Something About Mary'.  It's wasn't remotely funny in 'Mary', and it doesn't work here either.  If you have the mentality of a 12 to 16-year-old, you may enjoy it.  But for the rest of us, it just tries too hard to be funny.  It doesn't flow very well, and most of the situations don't make a lot of sense.  They just sort of 'happen' for no reason, hopelessly trying to get a few laughs.",4,4,6,4 April 2001
Shakespeare in Love," Undeserving of 'Best Picture' award
","How this movie beat out the likes of 'Life is Beautiful' to win the Best Picture academy award is baffling.  It has its moments, but this thing is FAR too long.  45 minutes of this movie is continuous recitation of the characters' lines in the play.  'Titanic' was the most overrated movie of all time, but this is pretty close.  Gwyneth Paltrow was superb and may actually deserve her Best Actress award.  Rupert Everett (Christopher Marlowe) was fantastic as well and probably would have performed the role of Will much better than Fiennes' minimal attempt.  The scenery gets a good grade too, but there's nothing else in this movie that deserves a decent comment.  It may have deserved a Best Picture nomination because the year gave us such a poor collection of decent shows, but it definitely did not deserve to beat out 'Life is Beautiful'.  I give it a 6/10.",6,2,4,21 March 2000
The 13th Warrior," dumb movie
","This movie is so dumb.  It's sort of a cheap quickly made mix of Braveheart and Seven Samurai.  The story isn't believable at all.  Spaniard Antonio Banderas is absolutely horrible at portraying an Arab.  The directing was very inconsistent.  In the first 20 minutes of the movie, everybody spoke his native language and it seemed realistic.  Then all of a sudden, everybody started speaking English.  Strange phenomenon.  Even the fight scenes were bad.  Don't waste your time.",3,0,1,16 March 2001
The Mummy," where's the plot?
","This movie was pure crap.  The previews made it look good, but there was nothing there.  This was simply another 'He's got the power to destroy the world with the blink of his eye, but he cannot defeat his human enemy in a FIST FIGHT!!!'  Geez.  Special FX were pretty good, but the acting was bad and the script was worse.",7,0,0,7 October 1999
Sleepy Hollow," marvelous costumes and scenery
","This was the best 1800 scenery and costumes I've ever seen in a movie. Combined with the clever use/lack of color, they conjured up an image of precisely what we would think 1800 New England would look and feel like.The worst thing about the movie was the music.  It was quite dreadful and lacked any sort of synchronization with the ongoing plot.  Mystery music continued through the comical scenes so much that it confuses the watcher and almost hides the comedy itself.  It did very little to strengthen the plot and most of the scenes could have done without music entirely as the scenery, color, sound, plot, and acting were more than capable of sustaining the movie's quality.I really didn't know what to expect when going into this.  Some critics bashed it for not sticking to the book and others praised the costumes and scenery.  I don't see the veering from the book's plot a weakness at all. In fact, it was much more entertaining and satisfying than the original.I was a bit confused about Ichabod Crane's character and personality. Although Depp appeared to play what was directed, the character itself seemed to lack the intelligence, experience, and couth you'd expect from the character in the original story.  But alas, this is a rewrite, so I probably should not criticize for this.Christina Ricci (Katrina) definitely shows promise although she appeared to lack enthusiasm.  For that much money, you would expect her to be able to 'fake it', but it was still a decent job.  Miranda Richardson (Lady Van Tassel) had some good moments, but she also lacked enthusiasm and seemed very distant at times.  She has proven worthy with perfect performances in 'Merlin' and 'Alice in Wonderland'.Fabulous performances by all of the members on the town's council, but Jeffrey Jones is still stuck in my head as 'Charles Deitz' in 'Beetlejuice'.Christopher Walken was absolutely incredible and easily stole the show!! Don't worry, you won't miss him.  He was a perfect choice for the role and will be the face to remember the movie by (Sorry Johnny).",9,0,0,10 July 2000
The Thing," one of the best horror films ever
","This is clearly one of the best horror films that has ever been made.  This movie excelled in acting, screenplay, sound, script, etc.  There really was no weak point in this movie.  When writing a horror film, the primary thing that sets apart the great horror films from 'the rest' is the ability to capture true human fear.  This movie does it.  The worst fear known to all of humanity is to not know who or where your enemy is.  This is what the movie is all about.For all fans of this movie, be sure to hunt down the X-Files 1st Season episode 'Ice'.  This is a remake of 'The Thing' and done extraordinarily well.  This is available on VHS and DVD.  Find it and buy it.  You won't regret it.",9,0,1,26 June 2000
U-571," Great action!
","Great entertainment.  Fantastic acting and action.  Superb special effects. Matthew McConaughey gives the best performance of his career.It takes place in the Atlantic in WW2.  A German U-boat is attacked by an allied battleship and almost completely disabled.  It doesn't have enough power to return home so it becomes a sitting duck.  The sub, however, is carrying an enigma machine, a priceless piece of communication equipment that encrypts/decrypts German messages.  In the hands of the Allies, it could be the difference between losing and winning the war.An American sub is immediately sent out to retrieve the enigma from the German sub.  But the Germans are aware of it too and are trying to reach it from the opposite direction before the enemy can get their hands on it. What follows is a non-stop thrill ride.",9,2,6,16 March 2001
The Shining," another overrated Kubrick film
","I don't understand why so many people like this movie.  The minimal plot is so lame, they seemed desperate to fill in the holes with meaningless scenery and scenes.  Scatman Crothers, who played the chef Dick Hallorann, seemed to think he was in a completely different movie than the rest.  Talk about not having chemistry.  This was the extreme.  The intensity and over-dramatized fluctuations in his lines sounded like he thought he was giving an infomercial sales pitch.  He stood out like a sore thumb and just his presence is very questionable, as if they only added him later to fill some sort of socio-political gap, if you know what I mean.The entire story was very weak.  They tried to explain Jack's random insanity by suggesting the hotel was haunted with the spirits of past guests whom I assume were murdered or died there.  And he was supposed to be falling in the footsteps of a previous caretaker who went on a murderous rampage, killing his entire family for no apparent reason.  Say what?It didn't work.  There were too many different ghost and horror elements thrown in for it to many any sense.  That's all it was: just a bunch of elements 'thrown in', nothing more.  As hard as they desperately tried to scare me, I just became more bored.  In some of the 'scary' scenes, I found myself chuckling at the absurdity of it all.  It has to at least be a little believable.  It falls way short.There are much better films out there to try to pass off as great horror films.  But like most of Kubrick's work, the legend of this film exceeds the quality by miles.  Another example of the most overrated director in Hollywood history.",5,1,3,8 April 2001
Titanic," One of the most over-rated movies of all time
","I still don't see why anyone thinks this is one of the best movies ever. This is a good movie, not a great one. The screenplay was simply ridiculous. It doesn't even look like the inside or outside of a ship. It actually LOOKS like a stage!Leonardo was terrible. He made no attempt at playing a young punk. He simply played himself. He was magnificent in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, but hasn't done anything since worth watching. He's simply a pretty-boy who cannot play this type of role.This film is filled with lots of good actors in pathetic roles. Kathy Bates is one of my favorites, but her character in this was horrible. It represented absolutely nothing, had no substance, and was completely fictional.Fictional...that's what this movie was. From the start, the 'foggy' appearance of the movie, which was supposed to give you the illusion of the early teens, just made the movie look like poorly-drawn animation. This was obviously an attempt at making a classic. This is a recipe for disaster. Classics were never meant to be classics. They were meant to be movies. Try making a good movie, and it might become a classic. Try making a classic, and its lack of substance will cause it to break apart into tiny little pieces.The good thing about the movie was the final scene in the water. This was a marvelous job by DiCaprio and Winslet.Unfortunately, this was just another example of the public being sucked into an extremely high-budget, over-publicized pathetic movie.",Null,2,3,12 April 1999
The Sixth Sense," Best movie of the year!
","I don't get excited about movies too often, and this year I've been thoroughly disappointed, having shelled out the bucks to see Star Wars, The Mummy, and American Pie--all big duds!  This is the best movie on the big screen since Saving Private Ryan, a true winner.  Bruce Willis puts on his best show, possibly of his entire career.  Osment is the best child actor I've seen since Tatum O'Neil in Paper Moon (1973).  His ability to capture all of the idiosyncrasies of a frightened boy with the '6th sense', those characteristics we the naive would never think of, is unheard-of in a child actor.  This movie has it all!  It's a thriller, horror, a little comedy, romance that will make you cry.  It's like Ghost (1990), taken to another level!  It is WELL worth the overpriced tickets!!",10,0,0,9 August 1999
Rear Window," One of Hitchcock's best
","This is one of Hitchcock's best movies.  It is very original, and extremely well-acted by three of the best actors in history.Jimmy Stewart plays a magazine photographer who's stuck in his apartment while his broken leg heals.  He spends his days peering out the rear window of his apartment into the open windows of the apartments across the courtyard.  He sees lots of life stories, parties, arguments, sex, just about everything that happens in real life.One thing in particular catches his eye though.  He sees what he thinks may be a man (Raymond Burr) trying to clean up and hide evidence after murdering his own wife.  He doesn't witness the murder itself, so he spends the next few days, with the assistance of his Park Avenue girlfriend (Grace Kelly) and his hard-nosed nurse (Thelma Ritter), trying to find enough evidence to prove it.This move is a must-see for all Hitchcock and mystery fans.  Clearly one of the best ever!I gave it 9 of 10.",9,0,2,8 January 2001
