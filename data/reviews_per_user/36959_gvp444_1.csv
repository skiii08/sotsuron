Requiem for a Dream," The Worst film I think I have ever seen
","I have never seen such trash in my life. I watched this film back in 2002 and one thing I will say is that the memory has stayed with me since, for all the wrong reasons I'm afraid. Yes it highlights the drastic measures some take to get drugs and the risks that go with it and maybe some of it should be shown as drugs education to youngsters which will certainly put them off, but all in all I really have to say it is the worst film I have seen. I think if people want a film that gets inside their heads and makes them think about drugs and the effects it has on peoples lives and flicks between stories then this is for you but if you want a good story line that runs continuously throughout a film and don't want to be left feeling ill then stay away.I was left with a headache and the feeling I had wasted a couple of hours of my life watching it.",1,1,3,1 February 2008
