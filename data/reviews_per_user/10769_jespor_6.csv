",Wow. This is actually an incredible movie in which Gyllenhaal delivers an Oscar worthy performance.It's kind of an emotional rollercoaster which gives you the best of the two different worlds in boxing and drama. A comeback story at its finest. The father-daughter relationship gets me the most.I've seen this movie more times than I can count and it still amazes me that Jake Gyllenhaal didn't even got nominated for this one - he is outstanding!,8,20,22,31 May 2019
