Blade Runner 2049," Tedious beyond belief
","I loved Blade Runner and watched the movie at least 3 timesI loved the Computer game and must have played it through around 3 timesToday Amazon has just delivered the DVD of Blade Runner 2049 we purchased. Tonight we watched it eagerly.2 hours later having fought off wave after wave of fatigue, I realised I'd just gnawed my left leg off.This has to be the most ponderous film ever made. Tedious, boring, stilted, unnecessarily obscure were words that sprung to mind - and that was just the acting.I have left the TV and came to IMDB to see if others thought this boring film a new masterpiece. From the comments many appeared to feel the same as myself.I couldn't give a bleeping bleep what happened at the end. I will never know and when they make Blade Runner 2069, 2089, and 3999 I will be giving them a miss as wellSave a life. Watch a real film !!PS With all 1 out 10 marks this film has been given - can someone please explain why IMDB has a relatively high overall score? Surely there hasn't been a crowd-funding campaign to make this piece of dross appear to be a great success - has there?",1,5,9,23 June 2018
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," An Unexpected Treat
","This was meant to be a 'stocking-filler' - just a movie on a cold Christmas holiday afternoon. A children's story from over 50 years ago - probably with so many anachronisms and cuteness it might even be kitsch.Having already suffered the appalling massacre of JK Rowling's 4th book, I knew I could manage anything. However, when 'Disney' came up in the opening credits I settled down for a good snooze. Definitely this was not a film this 'Grumpy Old Man' could possibly enjoy!! Well how wrong I was!!! The cast was excellent. All credit to the 4 children, great young actors. The animation was stunning and the scenery, wow!! I was enthralled right from the start.There were a few tongue-in-cheek pieces of 'modern' dialogue - but I found them to enhance the believability rather than the opposite. I would have to be a real old *** to find fault at all.Reading a couple of the (very few) negative reviews for this film  I wonder just what those critics expected from Narnia. This was a superbly-made children's fantasy!!",10,6,9,29 December 2005
Troy," What happened?
","This film had everything - a great director, a great cast, a great story and a great budget. So what on earth happened?Having missed the film on its short run, I have just watched the DVD. It was a hell of an effort. The dialogue was hysterical, the music was painful, the actors were wooden or unbelievably hammy and the story, having survived for 3000 years, had been turned into a TV soap opera.Afterwards I switched on the computer to read IMDb reviewer's comments. I came across a couple of critiques nominating this film as 'the Best Film of 2004'. Surely the writers were being tongue-in-cheek because if Troy really is their idea of a great film, I feel sorry for them - they are far too easily pleased.This was one of the biggest wastes of talent I have ever seen 0/10",1,3,8,29 October 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," This could have been a great Disaster Movie - but .....
","*** Very Minor Dialogue Spoiler ***When will the Hollywood 'Disaster' movie makers realize that 'Special Effects' alone will not make a great film? Every single big-budget film of this genre follows the same pattern · Character (or situation) warns of disaster ahead · Suspense-filled prelude to the disaster occurring · Disaster occurs · Incredible special-effects of the aftermath of disaster · Heroic, indefensible actions in the face of titanic odds · Sacrifice of several lovable characters · Cheesy ending · (and speaking as a Brit) God Bless America!!!This film should have been a classic. · The premise was plausible (watch the Discovery Channel) · The cast assembled was good · The special effects team were superb · The direction was passable. · The film looked great.BUT · Why were the scriptwriters allowed to create such appalling storyboards and scripts? · Why did we have to endure such farcical, paper-thin, cliché-ridden characters? · Where were the two nuns whose role is always to comfort a dying child - they were sorely missed?I did however manage two guffaws - · the first when it was suggested that Mexico had decided to allow refugees across their borders as a result of the USA cancelling their debts to American banks · the second when there was an announcement that Third World countries would happily welcome the influx of millions of refugees.Despite all this - I did enjoy the special effects within this film. They are probably among the best I have seen.However - Score 4/10 Not good enough  must try harder!!!",4,0,1,8 June 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Like the Curate's Egg - Good in Parts
","In my view 'The Prisoner of Azkaban' is J K Rowling's best work. From what I had read, I expected that Alfonso Cuaron would scrap the 'Hollywood' style and his film would reflect the darker nature of this story.He certainly did achieve that. The film was beautifully filmed and was genuinely eerie in places. His animation of the Hippogriff was fantastic - most believable.Of his actors - David Thewlis as Lupin was not as I pictured the character but did an admirable job. Gary Oldman as Sirius however was woefully under-used. Michael Gambon was an excellent replacement Dumbledore and all three central characters turned in fine performances.Nevertheless I left the cinema feeling disappointed. I had a feeling that the POA should have been a great film - but wasn't!! If I hadn't read the book, I think a number of scenes would have completely baffled me.My prime objection was that I felt I had just been watching a 4 hour film in Fast-forward mode. Every scene was pared to the bone and over in 90 seconds or less. With the exception of Harry, Hermione, Ron and Lupin all other characters were reduced to mere 3 line cameos.Also what happened to the continuity? - 'The Leaky Cauldron', is now presided over by 'Igor the Truly Terrible' and has been transported next to a railway terminus. A landslide has caused Hagrid's cottage to end up at the bottom of a hill. Lakes appeared to expand and contract from scene to scene.Because of Cuaron's mad rush to produce a shorter film from a much longer book, many essential plot items disappeared. Did I miss an explanation of the Marauders Mapmaker's names? That surely was essential to the story. Harry needs to know this to believe his father saved him by using a Stag Patronus. Another key element of the book was Hermione's need to obtain the Time Turner so she should get to all her lessons. The film barely touched on Hermione's impossible school timetable.Obviously a scriptwriter's job must be to condense - but I felt the essential feel of the book was lost somewhere in the translation. With this in mind, I am certainly not looking forward to seeing any slimmed-down version of the next couple of books. I might just give their films a miss.I hope that the distributors will follow the LOTR example and the fully-extended 4 hour version of this film will shortly be available on DVD.Score 5/10",5,1,2,2 June 2004
The Pianist," Beautiful film but OH! - so very hard to watch
","I wanted to see this film when it in the cinemas - but thought it might be difficult to watch.When the DVD was released, I bought it but still found reasons to leave it till later.Finally I viewed it in two halves. It is a magnificent piece of work - desperately sad, perfectly acted and made with infinite care.It is profoundly unsettling to ponder on the behaviour of humankind. Why are some capable of such monstrous inhumanity while others behave with unbelievable selflessness to total strangers in need?The few reviewers who thought this film lacked action and was boring, can I respectfully suggest they stick to less demanding fare in which no thought process is required at all.For others who have not yet seen this film - please do so - but be prepared to be very moved by it.Adrien Brody will surely never surpass his brilliant performance in the role of Wladyslaw Szpilman. Roman Polanski has made the movie of his career. 10/10",10,3,7,8 June 2004
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Another missed opportunity
","GOF, like the last 2 films in particular, has left me feeling disappointed and extremely annoyed. The directors and screen writers are moving further and further away from the books. They feel they must create Hollywood-style blockbusters - high on spectacle and special effects but low on plot and characters.Harry's first task involved him being chased by a dragon around Scotland demolishing castles in the process. This was almost as ludicrous as the flying car and train sequence in Chamber of Secrets (or the incredibly tacky ending when Hagrid returned to the school).OK, I know some settings were very pretty - the Yule Ball and Underwater 2nd Task particularly so. However it is paramount that the audience had thoroughly read the book - otherwise many parts of the film would be absolutely meaningless.From start to finish the film appeared to be a race against time with subplots and characters disappearing by the score. The Quidditch World Cup was a non-event (Who won? Who cared!). Barty Crouch Junior suddenly appeared in what looked like a battlefield and apparently had devastated everything himself. Did Harry actually tell Dumbledore that he had just found Barty Crouch Senior hurt/maimed/dead in the forest or did Dumbledore just rush out the office on the off-chance? I am not naive enough to believe that every line from the book must be preserved. But the concept of 'I am the the director and know better than the author' has gone way beyond the acceptable here. Little of JKR's wording has been retained. Worse still the characterisations have been drastically altered.Dumbledore is no longer the solidly dependable guardian figure who believes in Harry and Harry's destiny. The wonderful character of Rita Skeeter could have been omitted from this film for all the effect she had. The goofs and omissions surrounding Sirius Black were appalling. None of Voldemort's Deatheaters seemed interested in his resurrection - let alone being scared to death. Where was the snivelling Wormtail at the rebirth of Voldemort? The Peter Pettegrew in the film could have passed for a TV chef.The humour of all eccentric characters has been eliminated and their appearance in the film serves just to provide cheap laughs.Book 4 is the pivotal book of the series. Its central characters are now young adults full of teenage angst. Evil has been let loose upon the Magical World which stands at the brink of catastrophe. Little of this comes across in this film. This movie ended with Hermione telling the boys to write to her over the summer????I know that we shall soon hear that this is the nth highest grossing movies of all time and everyone associated with will be nominated for Oscars. There is such affection for JKR's books that this is inevitable - no matter how bad the movieThe HP films are just travesties of what they could have been. It is a crying shame that Peter Jackson didn't tackle this project",3,0,1,28 November 2005
War of the Worlds," A Wasted Opportunity
","Great, a film remake of one of my favourite books. I was quite looking forward to see what Steven Spielberg would make of H G Wells' famous tale.As the final credits began to roll, I was filled with an overwhelming relief. Not, I hasten to add, because of an end to the tension but because the sheer tedious banality of the screenplay was finally over.Technically the film was brilliant. The sound, special effects, lighting were all up to Spielberg at his best.The actors also acted their parts with panache. However due to the dialogue they were required to utter and the emotions they were forced to portray, I quickly wished aliens had selected them as the first victims.What is it about Hollywood screenwriters - particularly the ones that mangle the majority of 'Blockbusters'? It is obvious they wouldn't recognise a cliché if it bit them on the ***. Please, please can someone convince them to try to make their characters two-dimensional at least.Well the film only cost £3 in a second-hand DVD shop so I can't really complain. I suppose I better just empty my sick-bag and settle myself down to the next offering",3,2,3,7 October 2006
