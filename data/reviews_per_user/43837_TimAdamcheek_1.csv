Vertigo," Excellent drama with perfect atmosphere
","Since I started with old films - Chaplin, Hitchcock, Kubrick, I just found something like a second home. Almost all of them have special atmosphere that at least works at me. But Vertigo is different. I didn't expect much of it, but that was the point. You play the film, expect nothing, and it's masterpiece! Alfred kept us during the film in suspense, expectations, and of course many questions. But in the end, Hitchcock answered all of (at least my) questions, and completed my expectations. What's so special about this film? It does make sense, it makes you ask yourself questions or create combinations why this happened, and so on. Definitely worth watching, even because of it's length - 2 hours 8 minutes 26 seconds. Since I saw this film, Alfred Hitchcock is my favorite director, and I can't wait watching his masterpieces.",10,2,3,29 March 2016
