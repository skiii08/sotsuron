Scarface," Extraordinary performance from Al Pacino !!!!!
","Just watch it for Al Pacinos performance.One can wonder what such talented actors are capable of given a meaty role. Al Pacino dives deep into the character as Tony Montana the immigrant from Cuba who has been lured by the lifestyle of the riches, gets in the act of becoming rich on whatever the given choice of work, overcoming any kind of obstacle obstructing his vision. One can feel the humane side in him when he cares for his sister so much like a little doll, when he exhibits his uncomfortness and anger on knowing that he is going to bomb the car that has the targets wife and children and his respect for Maama. The scene where he yells at Manny warning him to stay away from his sister, his telephonic conversation with Sosa are some scenes where his powerful acting can be witnessed.As a whole , a great movie and one can only understand actors like Al Pacino and De Niro are definitely the inspirations and encyclopedic reference of acting for actors to come by for generations !!!!!!",9,2,4,17 September 2015
The Hateful Eight," Awesome !!!! Transformer Avengers style fans stay away please !!!!
","First of , thanks to QT for not getting spoiled by modern era cinema making of a movie filled with Huge larger than life characters, Unbelievable stunts and wasting a lot of money on CGI and other unnecessary stuff. This is that movie which is sure to take you slowly through an entertaining chain of sequences that are cleverly acted, scripted and well directed by the master QT. You will be surprised with how the movie unfolds towards the last hour and is sure to give you all that's worth your money spent on ticket and pop corns. In an era where only movies with heavy CGI keeps topping the charts, a movie like this is a pearl out of a seabed full of weeds..Great acting by the entire team ....Samuel Jackson and Kurt Russel just rocked and others did their part well too !!! Please stop criticizing the movie and just watch how the reality unfolds !!!!! The beauty and creepiness of Wyoming is well captured as it would have been what it was in the 17th century !!!!!",9,2,10,15 January 2016
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Super cool movie !!!!!already watched it twice in theater !!!!
","Just go for it..high entertainment value..Tom cruise and his team is super cool.. good humour in the movie ..excellent action scenes...gripping scenes ...very nice locales....racy screenplay...Liked it much better than MI 4 when I started to feel the series was dying. MI 1 was raw, MI 2 had typical John Woo style action scenes which I liked it actually, MI 3 was super fast intense and brilliant, MI 4 was good, MI 5 has again rised the interest level in the series and certainly super good benchmark action scenes..looking for the next in series :) .already watched it twice in theater and not regretting for that !!!! Just watch it and enjoy !!!!",9,0,3,14 September 2015
