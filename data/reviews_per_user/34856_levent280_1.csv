The Blair Witch Project," Terrible amateur video masquerading as a movie.
","If one can call this a movie, it is truly awful.  The movie description is misleading.  It does not make mention of the fact that the entire 'movie' is actually an amateur video with an incredible amount of profanity.  It received an unjustifiable amount of praise.  If the video footage was used as the core of a real movie it would have been much better.",1,2,4,29 January 2000
