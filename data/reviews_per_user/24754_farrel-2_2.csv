Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Flawed in conception.
","After twenty years, I like many was disappointed. I can't fault the acting on anybodys' part and the costumes and planets were beautiful. However...The first thing that disturbed me was Jar Jar. He and the Gungans are straight from the 'Full House' school of acting. Comments like 'how wude' are sickeningly unfunny and out of place.The second was the use of CGI. I know that CGI is now, but in all reality, the creature shops of old were so much more gritty and real. CGI is still at a stage where it reminds you that you are watching fantasy. It is too bright and flawless for creature creation and should be used for enhancement.Third, how American the aliens sounded. The worst offenders were the pod-race announcers. What happened to the growled pseudo-languages from Jabbas palace, accompanied by more appropriate subtitling. And so many Americanisms like the word nuts or pasted. Blew suspension of reality.And Midichlorians and evil asian trade federations? Don't get me started.5 out of ten",Null,0,1,12 April 2000
Pearl Harbor," American Blockbuster
","Sigh. Yet again, the American blockbuster machine massacres history and entertainment. And yet again it is with the subtlety of  a brick to the head. Every hero shot and `memorable moment' are spelt out explicitly and along with the patriotic speeches, come fast and furious. Pick one of the many and shed a tear. The director apparently doesn't give his audience enough credit to be able to recognize a heroic moment by the action itself. He must resort to trailer-made tricks such as stirring music, slow motion shots and that steely-eyed stone jawed look that suggests the actor is in an arm wrestle instead of a terrifying fight for his life. In our world, not all acts of heroism are in slow-motion and blurred. Sometimes Japanese people (or any given enemy) laugh. Not every sentence a person says is laden with a message/moral. We sometimes discuss the trivial and in doing so, show our humanity. And not every hero has a touching and poignant death scene, expressing their best wishes. (For a stunning contrast, compare these points to something like Saving Private Ryan, or even better, a British movie) On top of this, much of the true drama of that day is merely brushed over, such as the fate of the flight of B-17s and the heroism of the crew of the Nevada in their efforts to save her. The fate of a dog is however a guaranteed heart-jerker.Don't be fooled, this isn't the fitting tribute to the brave fighters on both sides of the war. This is pure and shameless propaganda for reminding Americans that their country is great.",4,0,0,15 June 2001
