The Blair Witch Project," Disappointing(no spoilers i don't want to ruin it for you ...,the movie will do that itself .
",I was looking for this movie everywhere and i spent Â£5 on this and i wouldn't of if i knew . loads of my friends where like ooh its crap don't bother...They were right. The beginning is very slow and boring then when the 'scary' bits on the first few nights arnt scary because you cant really see whats happening . then when the person goes missing (i cant remember his name) and you hear his scream (a trick from the witch its not actually him hes dead) and they go looking for him and they see some 'scary' stuff but the camera doesn't even show it ! when they are actually in the cottage its again very confusing and the ending is pointless and does not make sense. but i wont say what happens cause if u actually want to watch .overall its a terrible film with no good story line .,4,2,3,9 May 2012
