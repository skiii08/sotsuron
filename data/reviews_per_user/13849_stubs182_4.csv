Iron Man 3," Not perfect but risky and enjoyable throughout
","Ever since the release of the first installment back in 2008 I've been a big fan of the series, I caught the first flick on the big screen 3 times and it's sequel twice, so my anticipation was high. I'd intentionally avoided most of the trailer, TV spots and early reviews as I tend to find too much exposure to pre-release hype diminishes the actual viewing experience, but I had a general idea of the direction. I'm also a big fan of director Shane Black and specifically Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, an action/comedy/buddy flick, set at Christmas featuring Robert Downey Jr, so I also had a general idea of what to expect in terms of artistic tone and I was not disappointed with what I saw. Easily the best Iron Man movie so far, the movie finds itself in an unusual position, not only is it the direct sequel to Iron Man 2 it also follows the events of The Avengers which plays a big role in the character development of Tony, who finds himself suffering from severe panic attacks which is understandable for a guy who just flew a nuclear weapon in a giant worm hole in the sky above New York opened by an army of evil intergalactic space aliens. So how do you create an appropriate threat for the man of Iron now that he's fought Avengers level threats? The answer is to cripple Tony's confidence, take him back to basics, essentially fighting himself back out of the proverbial cave with a bunch of scraps. What Shane Black has achieved is the funniest Iron Man movie that also features stunning action sequences, something that was somewhat lacking in the previous installments. As always the dialogue is witty and expertly delivered by Downey, but what really had me laughing out loud was a particularly inventive sequence featuring a not quite complete Iron Man suit.The big third act finally has been pretty much spoiled by every single trailer they put out but it still manages to deliver in terms of sheer 'ZOMG' awesomeness. I loved the relationship between Tony and the little boy and was genuinely touched by the heart warming ending. I've seen a few reactions by people wondering how Tony will feature in future installments specifically Avengers 2 now that he has removed his chest piece and destroyed all his suits, I would point out that it the chest piece isn't required to use an Iron Man suit, War Machine uses one, Iron Monger used one in IM1, Whiplash used a suit in IM2, Pepper Potts uses the suit briefly, so Tony will still be able to use an Iron Man suit when required. As to the destruction of his entire arsenal, He's Tony Stark, come on, of course he's gonna make more suits. He even says right at the end of the film, I am Iron Man. And essentially I always will be no matter what happens to me. And in case you had any doubt at all, the movie even spells it out for you in the end credits, Tony Stark will return. Speaking of end credits the stinger, the amount of people who stayed glued to their seats in anticipation of the now famous Marvel stingers was really a testament to their appeal. I really enjoyed this one, the relationship between Tony and Bruce was something I really enjoyed in The Avengers and I'm really glad they've decided to build upon that. Now just as few things I do have an issue with, The Ten Rings? As revealed in this movie The Madarin was nothing more than a tool used to manipulate the public, created by Aldrich Killan, that in itself I have no problem but it does raise one important question, what was going on in the first movie when the Ten Rings kidnapped Tony? Are we to now believe that Aldrich Killian was behind it all along? Or has Shane Black just created a pretty sizeable plot hole in the entire Iron Man series? That being said I really dug the movie and I'm super excited for the future of the Marvel cinematic Universe.",8,29,42,26 June 2013
World War Z," Not the book but still a great movie
","When I first heard that WWZ was to get the big screen adaptation I as many people I assume felt a mixture of feelings, excitement and skepticism. Excitement because there are several cinematic moments in the film, The Battle of Yonkers for example and skepticism because the narrative layout of the film is extremely un-cinematic and does not lend itself to the traditional 3 Act structure of Hollywood movies. As the movie fell into such difficulties during shooting my skepticism only grew but then the first audience reactions hit on twitter and hope was restored. Yesterday we went ourselves and saw the movie in 3D, going in my expectations weren't through the roof they were somewhere in the middle. I knew from reading a few reactions not to expect the book and just to embrace the movie for what it is which I did and I actually really enjoyed it.World War Z is worlds away from the book, which I think was inevitable but that doesn't stop it from being an excellent, fast paced, thrilling zombie movie. Brad Pitt nails it, predictably, in the lead role as Gerry Lane the retired U.N warzone investigator who is sent on a mission to find patient zero in an attempt to find a vaccine to the devastating zombie outbreak. To say there is nothing shared between the book and the movie but the title, as people on the internet have done, is actually unfair. There are glimmers here and there but it's fair to say that it's a very loose adaptation. The main similarity between the two is that they both use the zombie outbreak to examine the socio-political landscape on a global level: The North Korean 'solution', The Israeli Wall. Tied altogether with incredible big budget action sequences and special effects, there's a lot to enjoy in this movie.If there is a complaint to be made it would be in the movies third act, which actually goes against the grain in terms of big budget Hollywood action movies. Instead of turning up the speakers to 11 and blasting the audience into submission with a balls out finale, WWZ dials it back and goes for a slower yet still nerve wracking sequence.All in all I thoroughly enjoyed World War Z and would highly recommend it. Can't wait to watch it again on blu-ray and the inevitable sequel JOh and I was actually in Glasgow when they're were shooting the opening outbreak sequence, so yeah :P",9,1,6,26 June 2013
Man of Steel," Ruined by TV spots
","Too many TV spots, wayyy too many. After about the 7th TV spot I felt like I had pretty much seen the whole movie already and as it turns out, I had. All the best moments had been spoilt for me. But despite all that I really, really wanted to love this movie, when they first announced it would be Zack Snyder directing and Chris Nolan producing my head practically exploded with excitement. The dream team I thought to myself, Snyder's eye for epic, super powered action sequences and Nolan's dramatic, grounded story telling. How could this possibly fail? Well not that it failed exactly, but I certainly wasn't totally blown away in the fashion that I was sure I would be. Obviously my impression is massively tainted by the sky high level of anticipation I had for this film, but to be fair I was in the same state of mind when I saw The Dark Knight in the cinema and I walked away from that experience having had my high expectations absolutely blown through the roof, with Man of Steel however I left feeling just slightly mehNow having said all that I will say that this is easily the best Superman movie to date, it totally blows the rest of them out of the water. The action scenes, as we've all seen from the trailers, are the truest depiction of Superman's true power and the other great strength of the movie is the relationship between Clark and Lois, which is absolutely nailed this time. But other than that I found it pretty hard to care about a lot of the other characters. I wasn't overly impressed with Zod as I thought I would be, a lot of the obvious dramatic moments fell flat for me and a lot of the movie really felt by the numbers and predictable.They actually gave most of the best sequences to Faora and she displayed most of the best moments of Kryptonian abilities, shockingly I found myself more interested in watching her than I was in Superman. I was sure this was to set up Supes in the last act to start truly kicking some ass but no, the flip never happened. Obviously Superman wins but not in any spectacular fashion, he just sort of wins.In the final showdown Zod asks the appropriate question, if he was born and trained to be a warrior and on Earth he has all the same powers as Kal-El than what chance does he; a farm boy realistically have? And there is no answer for this question proposed. There real question then becomes why did they have that line in there when it's only purpose is to make the audience say to themselves, Yeah Zod really should have won.That's just one of the little things that really irked me, and the point is if I'm taking the time to actually pick that apart and get annoyed by it then the movie's not doing something right. Man of Steel is movie with serious ups and downs and unfortunately did not live up to the hype that surrounded it and having now had some time to analyse it I really don't know if there's anything DC can do to bridge the ever expanding gap between themselves and Marvel. And unfortunately for all the fans out there dreaming of a Justice League movie to knock Avengers off the top spot, this really doesn't bode well for it. To be fair if Man of Steel had dropped before any of the Marvel stuff had been set in motion I probably would have looked far more favourably upon it, but it didn't. And the landscape for comic book movies has changed so much in the last few years it feels like DC will forever be lagging behind which is really unfortunate.I don't want to end on such a down note, so I will say that there is the definite possibility for a successful Man of Steel sequel but I think there has to be a major change up, lose Zack Snyder.",6,0,2,26 June 2013
Gone Girl," Another classic Fincher movie
","Gone Girl - Review (Spoilers)Gone Girl is the latest directorial outing from David Fincher starring Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike in the leading roles, based on the Best Selling novel by Gillian Flynn who also penned the screenplay for the film. Fincher, like all great directors there are a few things we can assume about any project he's attached to before seeing even a single shot. The tone, the look, the atmosphere of the film. Fincher is truly a master of the craft and Gone Girl is yet another great entry into his filmography. Much like Fight Club and Girl with the Dragon Tattoo before it, Gone Girl once again represents a perfect marriage of source material and Director. A common aspect that underpins all these movies is shared theme of social introspection, a study on the darker sides of the human psyche. Where Fight Club explored the futility a male machismo in modern society, Zodiac presented the dangers of our cultural obsession with the macabre, Gone Girl is very much a twisted view of contemporary relationships, the violent clash of male and female ego. The plot of Gone Girl cannot be properly examined without going into spoilers which will be expressed from here on, you have been warned. Gone Girl as is depicted in the trailers revolves around the disappearance of Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) and the following media circus that revolves around her husband Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck). Nick and Amy as displayed in various flashback have the perfect relationship. They are both intelligent, good looking, affable young people living in New York when they meet and we view their ongoing partnership in stages as it progresses via entries in Amy's diary. They fall on hard times, Nick loses his job, Amy's parents have financial difficulties, Nicks mother gets cancer which leads to them moving back to Missouri, a point of contention for Amy. Nick is unwilling to work on their problems and Amy's attempts to fix their relationship are only attempts to fix Nick himself, she does not look inward for any hope of solving their ongoing issues. One day Amy is gone and the resulting police investigation paints Nick in a very unfortunate light and we are lead to believe that he is the worst kind of man. He was having an affair with a younger woman, he paid little to no attention to his wife outside of sexual conquest, Nick got lazy and is punished by the media accordingly. Eventually it seems there can be no other explanation, Nick definitely killed his wife. Only he didn't. Turns out Amy felt that as Nick was no longer pulling his weight in their relationship she would take matters into her own hands and frame her husband for her own murder and she took elaborate steps to ensure that Nick would be convicted. So we have an underachieving husband who does not appreciate his better half and a wife who takes extremely disproportionate action in response. You see where I'm going with this right? Now although it would be fair to say that both parties are at fault here we do end up leaning toward Nick, unless you're the type of person who thinks being a bad husband should be a punishable offense with the possibility of the death penalty in which case you would be squarely on team Amy in this instance. Amy who as it turns out is blatantly a complete psychopath, played flawlessly by Rosamund Pike. Honestly I would put her performance right up there with fellow big screen psychopath Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins, Silence of the Lambs). Affleck also turns in a brilliant performance and carries the film on his absurdly broad shoulders (here's looking at you Bruce Wayne) Believe it or not there are actually still a few twists and turns throughout the film but unlike most movie adaptations of book thrillers this is not a story built on twists it's built on characters and excellent work of Gillian Flynn shines through and goes to show the advantages of keeping the original writer on board for the film version. The story like all great books is built around a novel concept which places the characters into impossible situations and then seeing how those characters deal with them. I loved this film, like all great Fincher movies it stays with you long after the end credits, not just a throwaway piece of entertainment but a truly thought provoking experience. ☆☆☆☆☆",9,0,5,27 December 2014
