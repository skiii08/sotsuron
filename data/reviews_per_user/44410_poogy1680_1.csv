The Ring," Easily the best horror contender this year
","Well, where to start...  First off, I must insist that if you are ever given the opportunity to see the Japanese version, PLEASE see the American one first.  There is much to behold in the US release, especially in a visual sense.  The cinematography is phenomenal, and the tension was superb, as well as a great sense of shock timing.  Now, see the Japanese one, titled 'RINGU', and let your jaw drop.  I recommend seeing them in this order only because the American one is to be appreciated on its many great merits, but if it is seen after RINGU, you can really unfairly find THE RING lacking. I honestly was much more visually pleased at the horrors of the US release, but RINGU will have you clenching on to the edge of your couch.  I hate closets.",Null,1,2,21 November 2002
