The Blair Witch Project," hype never had it so good
","The effect was weak, at best.  I saw it while the hype was still a buzz, during its first week of release at the arthouses and well before it shot into Multiplex City.It's been compared to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which, in spite of the schlocky production, is genuinely a much scarier and more disturbing film. Where we had an overweight man wearing a grotesquely hewn leather mask, placing screaming girls on meathooks and sawing through brush after his last survivor, Horror Redefined now has us shaking in our boots from bundles of sticks and circles of stones.  I suppose that means that in the new world of what is scary, a circle of visciously screaming bumpkins trying to force the corpse of their dead patriarch to drop a hammer on a bound and defenseless girl's head is no match for casual-drug teens spewing language that would make Lenny Bruce blush.Unfortunately, the 'innovation' of horror and fright coming from the unseen had been developed long since-- and, as in Maupassant's stories of anguish (1887-90), expressed more eloquently.The cinematography gives rise to either motion sickness or boredom, and the production is so vapid as to be beyond belief.  It is certainly a promising student film effort, but hardly one that deserved such attention.In sum, the most frightening thing about The Blair Witch Project is that a considerable portion of the film cognoscenti seemed utterly convinced that it was a groundbreaking cinematic achievement.",Null,0,1,30 July 2000
Fargo," a great example of realism
","I first saw Fargo in a grand, opulent, and beatifully restored 1920s movie theatre, now used for 'special screening' films and the more accessible arthouse flicks.  Seeing Fargo was my first time in this theatre, and I return on a semi-regular basis.  I am glad to have had such a wonderful introduction, both to the theatre and to the film.  In both respects, Fargo is classic cinema: worthy of being seen in the palatial grandeur of the best movie houses, and the kind of movie that is well-remembered when discovering such wonderful old places.  Like the best output of the Coen Brothers, this is a remarkable character study relying on dark humor and cold realism (no pun intended) in creating a complicated and troubled scene of human emotions, troubles, and motives.  Its greatest success is in attributing each of its characters with a complexity of characteristics: each one can be liked in his or her own way, and each is presented with such realistic vision that the viewer is suspended in his predicaments.  The ability to capture the viewer is one attribute of a film that makes it great, and Fargo brilliantly displays that ability in the most subtle and quietly profound ways.",10,0,0,2 September 1999
