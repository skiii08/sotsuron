Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," what did you expect?
","OK, I've been out of the loop.  I didn't see the trailers, and I didn't read any of the critics' reviews.  I happened to see the first showing, but only because my girlfriend and I heard that there were still tickets left on the radio at about 11:30 Tuesday night.  So, I really didn't know what to expect.I think that helped.  I have to say that I enjoyed this movie as much as any I have ever seen.  The special effects and the action scenes were awesome, and the fight between Darth Maul and the two Jedi Knights was nothing short of inspirational.  Sure, the plot was a bit weak, and there were some cheesy moments, but I think the pure fun of Anikan's pod race more than makes up for that.  In short, I think people were expecting a life-altering, philosophically deep movie.  That's not what this is.  It's an action-filled special effects showcase, and it's really just a whole lot of fun.",7,0,0,28 May 1999
The Sixth Sense," Great movie, even if you know do know the ending....
","This movie definitely deserved a 10.  Somehow, it managed to be terrifying and surprisingly sweet at the same time.  And it's not like some movies, where you feel like they're 'constructed' rather than written because they pull at your emotions so much; this movie just managed to fit everything together perfectly.  There was even some humor, although it did little to ease the tension.Kudos to the actors in the film... I have to admit, I'd never considered Bruce Willis much of a dramatist before I saw this one.  And, while I'm usually skeptical of movies that have small children in them (I'm always afraid they're just in for 'cute' value), Haley Joel Osment was actually very, very good.  One performance that I'm sure will be overlooked is Cole's mother, played by Toni Collette.  I was very impressed by the realism she gave her role.The only thing that I didn't understand about the movie was the 'surprise' ending.  I figured it out a good 15 minutes into the movie, and was sort of amazed at all the people going 'what?' and 'oh my gosh' when they revealed it; I kept expecting some other secret to pop up.  That might be why I respected this film so much, though--even though I knew the secret, it still kept me on the edge of my seat the whole way through.  In fact, it's very hard to type this without my fingernails.  :-)",10,0,0,19 September 1999
