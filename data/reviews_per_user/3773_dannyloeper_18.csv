Minority Report," Minority Report (8.2) (82%) - Everybody Runs
","<ul><li>I've been going through Netflix and Amazon looking to watch old movies that I have never seen. I was told that this movie was a good one, so I came in with pretty high expectations, which is always risky when it comes to reviewing movies!</li><li>This film follows John, a lead officer as part of the Precrime program, a program dedicated to stopping murders and killings before they happen. John can see visual images of the crime happening, gaining clues as to where they reside. John is silenced and confused when he sees an image of himself committing a murder, and his name pops up as the perpetrator. John, now on the run, must find out who he is to kill, and how he can prevent it from happening.</li><li>This movie is an absolute joy ride, and may be one of the best sci-fi films out there, and it was made in 2002!!! Of course the visuals are not as perfect as they could be now, but the originality of the story really delivers on so many levels, and this is Tom Cruise at his best. This movie like all others has flaws, not too many, but they are still there. The biggest issue I had was what in the world happened to Sean?! We are never shown or told about an actual kidnapper and are just left to interpret. Seeing that Seans disappearance had such a large impact and John and his wife, it would be nice to know what really happened. All in all this is a classic, and would definitely re watch!</li></ul>",8,1,1,24 July 2019
Zodiac," Zodiac (9.5) (95%) - Invested from the start
","<ul><li>I've been trying to go back and watch more films made in the 2000's, as I have missed a lot of good ones and just need to take a break from modern cinema. I think it's safe to say that my favorite genre is thriller/mystery films, as I feel like I am more a part of the movie than any other genre. I was beyond invested into Zodiac, from it being a true story, to the eeriness and suspense throughout its course. Being that this is a true story, I tend to rate it in a different way, as what we are seeing is based on true facts. I tend to pay more attention to the overall acting and chemistry between the cast</li><li>The cast is stacked for this film, and they all deliver compelling performances. I never dove to much into the story of the Zodiac killer, but I've heard that the movie does a great job of presenting facts and actual details of the crimes committed. I have also heard that there is a whole other world of knowledge on the crimes, and I intend to investigate and learn even more as the movie was beyond interesting for me! I felt so invested in this movie from the very start and feel that everyone should watch it.</li><li>This film focuses on the Zodiac killer, a serial killer that would kill his victims and proceed to taunt the media by sending notes to the press containing his confession, as well as cryptic clues to let them know he is truly the one who committed the killings. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Robert Graysmith, a comic artist with a serious obsession with puzzles. He takes it upon himself to try and 'unmask' who the killer really is, and the whole movie documents his strategies and determination to solve this. 2 of the other main stars include RDJ playing Paul Avery, a writer for the post, and Mark Ruffalo (one of my favorite actors of all time) playing Dave Toschi, the main investigator on the case.</li><li>The main chunk of this film focuses on Graysmith being determined to unravel the different killings that happen, and connect the pieces, much like a puzzle. Toschi loses hope of ever finding out who the killer really is, as do many others, but Toschi comes around to a final proposal of the killer near the end of the film, but to this day, the killer was never 100% identified. I feel like I can't do to much more analysis until I read more about the case, but from a movie standpoint, I was never not watching and recommend to any film junkie!!</li></ul>",9,2,3,3 March 2020
Ready Player One," Ready Player One (8.6) (86%) - Everything I want in a gaming movie!
","<ul><li>Coming from a very passionate gamer, this movie is one that I can watch over and over and continually find enjoyment in! The concept isn't too original, and some of the character arcs are predictable, which is were I doc points for my score. That being put aside, the design of this movie is very satisfying and fresh. I like the whole idea of being able to escape the real world for a digital and more enjoyable one (also kind of a cliche). The cliches are pretty strong in this movie. Mother who chooses all the wrong boyfriends, living in a lower class society, a love interest that starts as an opposite of the main character, and a villain who wants to take control and run the show. Seems that it is harder and harder to find original concepts for modern movies, so I try to not punish scores too much. I still give this movie a higher score as I really enjoy the overall bridge from the real world and the digital one, as well as my general love for video game movies!</li></ul>",8,0,1,22 July 2019
The Hateful Eight," The Hateful Eight (7.7) - Definitely a Tarantino Film!
","<ul><li>This movie to me feels like a game of clue, with a more thought out story, and way more gore (classic Tarantino). I am a little indifferent about this one, on one hand I love the story and the plot, but I also just feel like it's so randomly placed, just pieced together as well do. I understand why the bounty hunters killed Minnie in a sense, but it almost feels avoidable, especially since Mr. Warren is know for being a very intelligent bounty hunter, as he defuses the situation at hand. We also are introduced to Jody, but he gets barley any screen time in this VERY long flick. I actually enjoyed Tatum's character, but it is short lived and underwhelming for sure. This all being said, it is still a great Tarantino film and I gave it just under an 8 for the reasons listed above!</li></ul>",7,0,1,23 August 2019
Shutter Island," Shutter Island (10) (100%) - My personal perfect movie!
","<ul><li>Where do I even start, this is my one and only perfect 10/10 movie! Everything from the story, the suspense, the twists and turns, just perfect!</li></ul><ul><li>in my opinion, this is Leo's best role, and I know that is a bold statement but I will stand by it! Teddy Daniels is a federal Marshall sent to Shutter Island, a mental institution for the criminally insane. He is joined on with Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) to investigate a missing persons report, one of Rachel Solando. Since minute 5 I was totally hooked on the story, Teddy lost his wife to a pyromaniac who just 'happens' to be held in this very same institution! Not only does Daniels want to help with finding the missing Ms. Solando, but also track down the man that set his apartment complex up in flames, the flames that consumed his wife Dolores. That mans name is Andrew Laeddis.</li></ul><ul><li>This film contains so many different elements that I love. One of my personal favorite things to do when watching movies is think, think of how I think the story is playing out, and with Shutter Island, you will always be thinking. I don't want to get to much into the story because you just need to see it to be immersed as I am every time I re-watch it! I can confidently say i have seen this movie over 10 times, and I will continue to watch it as it is a beautiful masterpiece!</li></ul>",10,0,1,19 July 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (9.6) (96%) - Simply Brilliant
","<ul><li>This Spider-Man movie is unlike all others, exploring a world we're there are more than one individual that has been giving these powers from radioactive spiders. We follow Miles, a young kid who has in fact been bitten and slowly learns that he is just like his idol, Peter Parker. Miles has to deal with a couple of conflicts this movie. Hiding his powers from his Spider-Man hating cop dad, learning this new found abilities, saving his dimension and others from KingPin, and dealing with an loving uncle that is also working for the bad guy. A lot of these can be considered cliches, but this movie stands out from the rest, especially from and animation standpoint.</li></ul><ul><li>This animation does something that most others don't, and that's balancing aspects that make a movie good. This movie is so funny, and has a such unique sense of humor. There is a scene where miles throws a bagel at a bad scientist, and when it hits him a text comes up. This text just says 'bagel' above his head, and it made me laugh so hard! The comic book feel of hand drawn animation is so perfect, and the most brilliant thing is in the frames themselves. While Miles is learning to hone his powers, he is quite bad when it comes to web slinging and using his abilities. This being taken into consideration, he is a lot slower than Peter. The animators didn't only show him falling behind, but actually animated him at 12fps instead of the normal 24. This not only gives a sort of slow feeling to Miles, but as the movie progresses he gets faster and faster, eventually getting to 24 frames.</li></ul><ul><li>Just a glorious movie, treat yourself to it if you have not yet!</li></ul>",9,1,2,22 July 2019
The Machinist," The Machinist (8.1) - An original and interesting plot
","<ul><li>I've never seen a more dedicated transformation for a role than what Bale did for this part. Trevor is a sleep deprived industrial worker who is struggling to deal with something of his past as well as his present. Trevor is haunted by Ivan, a recurring figure that to all others does not exist. Not only does Trevor have a lack of sleep, he in fact has not slept in over a year, rendering him exhausted and vulnerable to his own mind playing tricks on him. Trevor slowly starts losing trust in everyone who has given him hope. Then, he eventually cracks, to the point of no return.</li></ul><ul><li>This genre of movie is one I tend to gravitate to, as i like a film that allows me to interpret the plot from beginning to end. Bale's performance is so deserving of an individual award. This movie has a slow build up, but I never looked away as I knew some big twist was always coming my way. This is a treat of a movie and I suggest it to anyone!</li></ul>",8,1,3,16 August 2019
Ratatouille," Ratatouille (9.9) (99%) - A Pixar Masterpiece!
","<ul><li>By far my favorite Pixar movie to date, and to think it was originally released in 2007 is just crazy!</li></ul><ul><li>Brad Bird once again shows his world class directing ability with an amazing story driven by motivation and gusto. Many people don't look at the inner meanings of films and a simple animation like this really demonstrates this, with a story of a 'low class' rat that has dreams to be something more! Not only is the story brilliant, but the imagery and movements used in this movie are so breath taking. Character development is a key factor in almost every movie, and the relationship between Remy and Linguini is handled perfectly, demonstrating the ups and downs of the duo. Whenever I want to relax or put a movie on in the background when I work, I choose Ratatouille!</li></ul>",9,0,0,19 July 2019
Saving Private Ryan," Saving Private Ryan (8.4) (84%) - One of the best war movies
","<ul><li>I would like to think everyone has seen this movie, and for good reason. I do not know a lot about WW2 history, so I don't know how historically accurate this movie holds. That being said, this film is a masterpiece and demonstrates the brutality and sacrifices US soldiers make. No punches are held throughout this movie, starting right from the start as the soldiers charge on the beaches of Normandy. This movie really jerks your around and does not hold back, so be prepared for a journey. This is one of the higher rated movies on IMDB, and most people know why. I have heard that this is a movie that a lot of veterans choose as there favorite, weather that be due to the similarities or the accuracy of the execution of the story. A must watch for sure!</li></ul>",8,1,2,22 July 2019
Good Will Hunting," Good Will Hunting (9.7) (97%) - A gem of a movie
","<ul><li>Matt Damon and Robin Williams are the perfect pair, and for a movie that was released in 1997, it really holds up!</li></ul><ul><li>This story hits home for me specifically, which is why I give it such a high score, but is definitely not the only reason I rated it so. One of the best examples in film of well executed character development, not only in the role of Will Hunting (Matt Damon) but also for Sean Maguire (Robin Williams). Will is a unknown genius, working as a janitor at a local university. He suffers with many different problems that are focused on throughout the film, building beautiful connections with other characters. The intensity in some of these scenes are just breathtaking, creating almost a sort of discomfort, but in a good way if that makes sense. This movie centers around emotions and feelings, which is something that I really appreciate and connect to. Highly recommend to watch this if you haven't!</li></ul>",9,2,3,19 July 2019
Ex Machina," Ex Machina (9.8) (98%) - An eerie and suspenseful journey
","<ul><li>At first, i was very skeptical about this movie. A plot based around an AI/robot displaying emotions and feelings towards human counterparts feels like a very overdone story, but the way director Alex Garland manipulated the viewer with a more concise feeling left me speechless.</li></ul><ul><li>I'll be honest, I knew how this would end, or had a strong idea of how it would end, but the beauty of this film is that 10 mins in i was not even thinking about that, and before I knew it I was shocked by how the timeline progressed. A movie generated around the idea of emotions, and then being the forefront of the story, really creates a different sort of feeling than others do. This film was so so so good and I suggest it to anyone who has not seen. Also, give my boy Oscar Isaac an award for this performance!</li></ul>",9,0,1,19 July 2019
1917," 1917 (9.2) (92%) - An intense and riveting movie
","1917 really blew me away, and i came into it with high expectations due to the numerous nominations and awards. The fact that the whole movie is manipulated in a way to seem as a seamless continuous shot really helps with the delivery. The connection between lance corporal Blake and Schofield seems so natural, and we are truly following these 2 for a good chunk of the beginning until we lose Blake to a downed German solider. The raw emotions of this film in my opinion outclass a lot of other war movies, as this is built on a true relationship that is tested and broken. There was also an eerie feeling to this film, and i was quite tense throughout it not really knowing what to expect next. The pacing is quite slow overall and this is not a movie you go and see if you expect a lot of action. It to me was more of an adrenaline rush and a patience game, as we are following only 2 soldiers that are trying to get past a multitude of defenses. Lone Survivor is a movie i felt like i could relate this to, but again 1917 is a lot slower and has more 1 on 1 battles that show the real emotions of war.
This movie is truly a treat and will be a top of my favorites for 2020, as i was late to the party on seeing this in theaters.
A real masterpiece.",9,0,2,2 February 2020
The Dark Knight," The Dark Knight (9.9) (99%) - Heath Ledger in the driver seat
","<ul><li>Everyone says it, and of course it's true, this is by far the best joker and one of the best solo performances we have been gifted with. Heath Ledger is a mastermind, and all we can say is RIP. His role in this movie will never be forgotten, and he shattered my expectations for this film.</li></ul><ul><li>The individual performances in The Dark Knight may just be the peek of the last decade. The characters of the DC world, or any comic story are some of the hardest roles in the industry, having the most critical audience. Not only are we giving the phenomenal performance from Ledger, but we also get Christian Bales amazing Batman, as well as other side roles. Like the title suggests, this movie is driven by Heath Ledger, and how he transformed into the crazy and psychotic Joker. I would talk more about how amazing this film is, but I would rather just have everyone experience it for themselves. Outstanding.</li></ul>",9,1,2,19 July 2019
Joker," Joker (9.4) (94%) - The hype delivered!!
","<ul><li>Without a doubt the best movie of 2019, and I'm not done seeing movies ( that's how confident I am ). No movie has ever gone this deep into a characters development then Arthur. From start to finish I was hooked, and unlike other movies that fall short when it comes to endings, Joker thrives!</li></ul><ul><li>A believe getting a Joker origin film was heavily needed, and a break from the disappointing DC movies that we have gotten prior. Arthur is a struggling middle aged man, still living with his mom, and pursuing a comedic career. Arthur has a condition where he laughs uncontrollably and can't seem to stop, to the point of being in pain. Not only that, but he always seems to laugh at the worst possible times. Arthur deals with day in and day out, being fired from his job, getting picked on and beat up by higher class Gotham residents, getting made fun of by his idol talk show host, and the breaking point, finding how he was adopted and abused by the one person he thought he could trust the most.</li></ul><ul><li>This movie shows the decrease in mental health for our main character, to the point where he eventually snaps. After murdering 3 high class boys, Arthur sees the city recognizing him and idolizing the image of the killer as being a hero, a true hero. He slowly starts to embrace the image of the joker, a masked killer who stands up for the lower parts of the city. After Arthur finds out the truth about his 'mom', he takes her life, seeing it as a justified kill to relieve the pain from his previous life. He starts an up roar in Gotham, gaining followers and supporters. Near the end of the movie, he takes the life of his old idol that made fun of him on live tv, and then chaos takes place all around the city, resulting in Bruce Wayne's parents being murdered in the up roar.</li></ul><ul><li>The ending of this movie created a lot of fan theory's, as we end with Arthur in an asylum with a psychologist, that he then 'kills'. I have my own theory as many others do. This movie delivered on so many levels and will remain to be my favorite of the year, and one of my favorite of all time.</li></ul>",9,0,1,4 November 2019
WALL·E," WALL-E (8.9) (89%) - Pixar does it again!!
","<ul><li>Pixar you dirty geniuses! This is by far there most creative and outgoing story in the universe, showing the future and what consequences can do. This movie has the signature Pixar charm, but also shows a more realistic view of what us as humans can do to the planet if we aren't careful. The characters are so lovable and have such original designs behind them. This movie can teach so much, and the brilliant idea behind WALL-E and he is designed. Please watch this if you haven't and enjoy it!</li></ul>",8,0,0,24 July 2019
Arrival," Arrival (9.2) (92%) - So GOOD!!!
","<ul><li>This movie is so good, it's hard to even summarize this review. Unlike other alien movies, this one takes a unique approach in which the life forms that have entered the universe are not here to take over or destroy, but to inform the main characters of there future, piecing together clues that we as viewers saw as just screen time. One thing I always harp on is how much I love movies that have some sort of twist or skewed perspective on the plot, much like shutter island (my favorite movie of all time). This is definitely the case here with Arrival.</li></ul><ul><li>Seeing the characters interact with the octopus like creatures is very, well unsettling at first, as we don't get to really see them for a good portion of the movie. This movie focuses way more on the interaction and adaptation of both the aliens as well as the main characters, and how they develop a</li></ul>way to understand the creatures way of communicating. The overall approach to the story we are given makes this movie worth it, but add in the amazing acting and character development, and you get yourself one of the best alien focused movies, in my opinion of course :)",9,0,0,4 October 2019
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Kingsman: The Secret Service (9.1) (91%) - Guilty Pleasure
","<ul><li>This is just everything I look for in an action/adventure movie. While I did enjoy The Golden Circle, the first installment of Kingsman just hits different.</li><li>The whole idea of a secret agency that deals with crime and affairs is so much fun, and the way it's handled in a sense feels more real than I would of though. Taren Edgerton is such an amazing actor and he plays this role almost perfectly. Is this movie filled with Cliches throughout? Yes! But for some reason the comedy mixed with the elaborate fight choreography makes for an exciting action thriller. The whole concept of Taren slowly become more accustomed to his new spy life is a joy to watch unfold and the comedic bits of relief really bring this movie to another level.</li><li>If you are at all interested in spy action movies, this is for you, and make sure you watch the second movie as well!</li></ul>",9,0,0,3 March 2020
Braveheart," Braveheart (8.2) (82%) - FREEDOM!
","<ul><li>It's been a while since I've seen this classic, but I definitely remember it and it is one of the most iconic movies in today's day. I originally saw this movie back in high school, in my history class and was blown away by how upfront and emotional this film is. It's not one that I have revisited, but is a genuine and revenge filled tale. Also, this movie holds an award for on of the most iconic scenes of all time! FREEDOM!</li></ul>",8,0,4,24 July 2019
