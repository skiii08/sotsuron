Hereditary," A game changer
","Hereditary is scary as hell. Its transformation from social conflict to the supernatural is mesmerising. Tony Colletes' riveting performance is Oscar worthy especially after Charlie's death. Damn, you should watch this movie.",10,0,4,18 October 2019
The Irishman," 9.7/10
",Another Scorsese masterpiece. Damn he never disappoints. All of his movies were fantastic and there's know doubt that he nailed it with The Irishman.,9,3,5,18 February 2020
1917," A hollow spectacle
","It looked good.....and uuuh......that's it. The cinematography is impressive, Roger Deakens did a fantastic job. But that's pretty much it. Everything else is bland.",6,2,5,18 February 2020
Joker," 11/10
","Bruh......
Seriously one of the best movies I've ever seen. The combination of the Acting, Direction, Music and Cinematography makes this movie a surprise triumph.",10,5,8,18 February 2020
Parasite," 9.5/10
","Wow this is a masterpiece. One of the best films of 2019. Boon crafted such a beautiful world, with writing that seamlessly blends together with every scene.",9,3,7,18 February 2020
Marriage Story," 5.6/10
","Dissapointing from Baumbach. It's all just a big ball of meh. The acting is great, the score doesnt make any sense considering the theme of the movie, supporting cast is bad, really awkward and cringy moments.",5,2,7,18 February 2020
