Minority Report," Spielberg is getting like Kevin Smith
","Spoiler Alert Just as Kevin Smith's films presume a thorough knowledge of recent films (especially, of course, the Star Wars films), Spielberg, both in A.I. and now Minority Report, is beginning to make multiple references to other films. The ones I had noticed that weren't in the trivia section were:1)The umbrella scene outside the mall, which brought to mind not only Hitchcock but also the wicker basket scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark.2)Tom Cruise being set upon by the jetpack precrime officers in the alley was like Dorothy and the flying monkeys in Wizard of Oz.3)The scene in which Det. Witwer explains the unsolved crime to Director Burgess and gets shot for his trouble is almost a scene-for-scene reshoot of Jack Vincennes explaining his unsolved crime to Capt. Dudley in L.A. Confidential.",10,0,0,11 August 2002
Spider-Man 2," Ethnic slur
","After all the complaints Lucas got for Episode I about ethnic slurs that harked back to films of the 1930's, I am amazed that no one has focused on the obvious one in SM2. I do not think it is a spoiler to reveal that Peter Parker's landlord is portrayed as a money-grubbing, grasping Eastern European Jew. I found these scenes very distracting and disturbing for that reason and I felt such a slur was entirely uncalled for. Other than that glaring problem, I agree with the other comments that this film is far better than SM1. The Jonah Jameson scenes are always the best part of the film, IMHO, and he is fortunately given far more of them in SM2.",Null,0,0,15 August 2004
