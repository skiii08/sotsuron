The New World," Well executed
","I am taking a History through Film class at school and this was the first film we watched. Terrence Malick tells the story of Pocahontas that people may be more familiar with. Although not historically accurate, it's a well-known take on the story. This film tells the story of the journey of John Smith in Jamestown and all the trials that came with it, along with Pocahontas. We get to see both sides, from the settlers with John Smith to the Natives with Pocahontas. This enabled us to see the background in the two groups interactions and how the relationship between John Smith and Pocahontas intertwined in it all. Other than Disney's 'Pocahontas' (1995), this was the only other movie I'd seen that depicts this story of Pocahontas and I did end up enjoying it. I thought the film was beautifully shot, especially the nature visuals throughout the movie. I also thought the soundtrack was great and fit the film well. It was well casted and I thoroughly enjoyed all the actors performances, especially Q'orianka Kilcher. I liked how the story extended past Jamestown and we were able to see Pocahontas' arrival with John Rolfe back to England. We got to see her in a new environment with a completely different culture and I thought Kilcher did an excellent job at showing those emotions she was feeling. One part that was probably my favorite was the final sequence. It shows the moment of Pocahontas running through the courtyard with her son with a brief narration from her, which then cut to John Rolfe's voice-over of a letter to their son stating her sudden death. Malick was able to stunningly piece together the final moments in her bed, to the moments where she was running around outside and enjoying the world around her. The score by Richard Wagner, I think, is what ties it all together. The music builds as we see the final shots before it abruptly stops and we finish with shots of nature and it's surrounding sounds. This ending reminds me of the way the more recent film 'Arrival' (2016). Both movies ended in a similar way, with an assortment of different shots and a complementary musical score of a bittersweet moment that bring the whole thing together. Although I can see how some people may not like this film, I really did enjoy it. I probably with look more into Terrence Malick's other work.",8,2,2,4 September 2018
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Stream South American Getaway
","I enjoyed this movie much more than I thought I would. I don't usually like western-type movies, but this one actually did. This movie was released in 1969, so I was expecting parts of it to be boring, there weren't any parts where I lost interest. I thought it was shot really well and the intense zoom-ins made it even more amusing. I especially liked the witty dialogue between the two which added to the characters. It' s cool to see actors I know now when they were younger. The montages throughout the film were also great along with the soundtrack (which is full of bops). The only thing I would question is the ending because I've heard many different things about how the two died.",9,2,4,2 November 2018
The Alamo," Stream Deguello De Crockett
","I watched this movie for my History Through Film class. This movie is about the Battle of the Alamo and the defeat of Santa Anna's army. The Battle of the Alamo was lost, but those with Sam Houston were able to gain independence from Mexico in honor of those who died at the Alamo. I'd watched this movie a couple years ago in my Texas History class so I was able to have some background knowledge on the actual history while watching. I think that I enjoyed it much more the second time around. The movie was historically accurate and I was surprised at the detail that was put into it. I also thought the actors, for the most part, were really good and portrayed the historical figures well. I wish there was more character development in the movie because if you're not familiar with the historical figures, you don't really know much about the main character in the film. However, I do see why they wouldn't feel the need to as this movie is a retelling of a well-known event. Originally, I thought this movie was going to be boring, but I actually enjoyed it the whole way through. I have seen a couple of John Lee Hancock's films that he directed and I did enjoy them, but I don't think I will seek out to watch any others.",8,2,3,15 October 2018
Wonder Woman," Amazon icon
","I really enjoyed this movie and thought Patty Jenkins did an amazing job. DCEU movies in my opinion haven't been that great, but I think this one is a lot better than the others. It was cool to finally see a good female superhero movie. Even though Gal Gadot's acting isn't stellar in my opinion, I think she's really charming and fit the roll nicely. I watched this in a history through film class for WWI, so we looked at comparisons during the battle scenes with gases, trenches, etc. Although their isn't a magical pill you break open to give you super-human strength in real life, some of the other stuff was pretty accurate. I haven't seen other work directed by Patty Jenkins, but I'm hoping the next Wonder Woman installment will be just as good.",9,16,31,13 December 2018
Cinderella Man," Russell Crowe snapped
","I hadn't heard of this movie until I watched it, but I really ended up enjoying it. The beginning was kind of slow and I feel it took a while to pick up. Once the story started progressing, it became really interesting. Despite the slow parts, I think the acting made up for it. Russell Crowe and Renee Zellweger's performance was great. We also get to see a look inside how some people lived during The Great Depression and how people had to get by to survive. I'd never heard of James Braddock before so it was really interesting to learn his story. I've seen a lot of Ron Howard's films and this is probably one of my favorites.",10,1,1,4 December 2018
