United 93," Brillitantly realistic and respectful to those who died on 9/11
","This movie must be watched every September 11th. Paul Greengrass, the director of the movie has portrayed the events of the crash of United 93 so realistically, you'd feel like you're actually in the movie. The movie uses no-name actors and realistic, un-cinematic camera techniques. It doesn't even feel heavily fictionalized compared to Oliver Stone's World Trade Center which came out the same year as this one. You also get a perspective on the hi-jackers on what their mission is. You can clearly know that they have been brainwashed but just as scared as the passengers are. The movie also takes a lens on various air traffic control centers around the area and watch their reactions to the horrific events of 9/11. Again, like the scenes on the plane, the acting in the ATC scenes are very realistic.It is an absolute must watch.",10,0,1,1 November 2014
World War Z," What kind of zombie movie is this?
","Oh boy. About time Hollywood made a big-budget zombie blockbuster. It's a genre that has been succumbed by the crappiness of low-budget horror. Unfortunately for the former, Hollywood failed bring uplift the Zombie genre. Instead, Plan B Entertainment has given us a cliché-ridden, CGI heavy zombie blockbuster that had nothing to do with the source material except for the title and the fact that the protagonist is a UN employee.It took a while for World War Z to get finished. Re-writes, re- shoots. I thought all those delays was just the work of a masterpiece in the making. I thought wrong. Over 200 million dollars have been wasted on this. The movie is just like any other summer CGI blockbuster. Except that there's CGI zombies this time. Not only that, the zombies act like a swarm of bugs when they are bunched up on each other. The protagonist Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) isn't interesting and all the bloody zombie violence you would expect is dumbed-down for a PG-13 rating to cater to younger audiences. There is one good thing though that World War Z brought that is worth noting. It is one of the few movies to watch a zombie epidemic happen on a global scale. It's a globe-trotting movie like any other but it is quite interesting. World War Z has the potential to be one of the greatest zombbie movies of all time. The source material was perfect for a movie, or a TV show at the most. But Hollywood screwed it up and we got a generic blockbuster instead.",4,1,2,29 November 2014
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," A reboot done right!
","Being a fan of the original Planet of the apes series that first starred Charleton Heston, I was somewhat excited and worried when there was news about the new reboot known as Rise of the Planet of the Apes.When I got the chance to see it, I was blown away on how faithful it was to the original movies. There were many nods and references throughout the reboot but the strongest factor in ROTPOTA was the character development of Caesar (quite a bit rare in your typical Hollywood film these days).James Franco as Will Rodman may be the top billing actor but Andy Serkis as Caesar is the key main character in this wonderful reboot. As we see Caesar's life grow, we get to see how he is becoming aware of himself and his consciousness all because of his enhanced intelligence of a drug that genetically engineered his mother in the beginning of the film.One downside of the film was that it did not have the same social commentary as the original Apes film did. But maybe that will be saved for the next sequels. ROTPOTA was only the beginning of a new series. I did think this movie had a lot to say about animal abuse and does remind us that apes and other animals may not be as intelligent as humans, but they are still sentient creatures like us. I highly recommend this to fans of the original Series and I will say this is 100 times better than the Tim Burton remake back in 2001.",8,2,3,4 July 2014
Django Unchained," Tarantino Awesomeness in Historical Fantasy
","There's a reason why I'm attracted to the works of Quentin Tarantino. You can recognize the personalty in every movie he makes. Django Unchained is one of them. As an enthusiast in American history, I have an appetite for this kind of film. I knew this was gonna be historically inaccurate from the jump, but when was the last time you've seen a movie like his?Django Unchained is set in 1858, two years before the American Civil War. A German bounty hunter Dr.King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) frees a slave named Django (Jamie Foxx) from Texan slave traders. They work together as bounty hunters to hunt bad guys in exchange for Django's freedom and eventually finding his enslaved wife. Through- out their journey in the Deep South, they come across Mississippian Plantation owner, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) who owns Candyland. Right here is one of my favorite performances by DiCaprio. Candie also has a second-in command. House Slave Stephen whom is played by Samuel L. Jackson. Throughout the movie, you get a lot of the typical Tarantino stuff. Great dialogue, music pieces, high-octane bloody random violence, etc. Speaking of the violence, there's a quite a few unique gun battles you won't usually see in other movies. It's highly rewarding and entertaining once you experience them. My one problem with the Tarantino's latest movie was it's racist undertones. The main character Django says a line 'Kill white people and they give you a reward, what's not to like?'. First, he said that right next to a White German that showed him kindness and gave him freedom. Second, why would a movie portray such a subtle message like that? As one-dimensional as the movie was, it's really putting an Us vs. Them mentality on the whole race thing. However, this can sort of he made up when the movie has a 'White good guy' (Dr.Schultz) and a 'black bad guy' (Stephen). So it isn't trying to portray all people of a race as bad or good.Django Unchained is like any other QT flick with the exception of that this one tells the story with a a more linear plot. It's a lot of great fun and has a lot of personality as said before.",8,1,3,29 November 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," Good, but not great
","Guardians of the Galaxy must have been a very hyped Marvel Superhero movie of 2014. At first, it was questioned that a movie depicting a band of lesser known superheroes would ever make financial success on the big screen. When it was released on August 1st, throughout a few months, it was successfully huge. This was worth noting that audiences do have an appetite for something a little unusual.When I watched Guardians of the Galaxy from beginning to end, I wasn't entirely amused. It was enjoyable no doubt. But it had a lot of flaws in my opinion. I really hope the sequel in 2017 will bring some improvement because this sub-franchise of Marvel has a lot of potential.I'll start with the bad parts first. The plot is overall weak and too simple. The villain, Ronan wants an orb that has power and the heroes have to make sure he doesn't get it. I mean this movie is obviously based on a comic book and is supposed to be more light- hearted and less serious, but it really felt like a Saturday morning cartoon episode that is expanded to a full-blown blockbuster. Another downside of GoTG is that pop culture references = comedy/Humor. I don't get what's funny when a song from the 70's/80's is being played every 30 minutes throughout the movie. In fact, I'm already sick of the 1980's nostalgia that is prevalent throughout not just this movie, but other ones. It's becoming too cliché in this decade now. We get it. The 80's was cool for people that were kids at the time. We don't need this kind of pandering throughout every fun film. Guardians of the Galaxy also should have focused on less action and more character development. I really wanted to know more about Rocket Raccoon (which was my favorite) and more dynamic backstory on Gamora.Now the good parts of GoTG was the chemistry between the characters. Chris Pratt plays Starlord well and may become a Sci-Fi icon in the future. The world-building is also great. The GoTG franchise can really stand against Star Wars if it wants to.Guardians of the Galaxy is really a film that didn't not live up the hype, but it wasn't terrible or fairly decent either. It was good, but not great.",7,0,4,3 December 2014
Elysium," Great Sci-Fi action, but could have been better
","After the greatness of District 9, I was anticipated for the next project by Writer/Director Neill Blomkamp. Years later came Elysium and was somewhat amazed and disappointed at the same time. The movie is set in the year 2154 where Earth is overpopulated and all the wealthy elite have fled to a space station called Elysium. It's essentially a ring-world that harbors a natural habitat filled with grassy fields, reservoirs and beautiful mansions. Unfortunately for the folks down on Earth, Elysium is hard to get to let alone live there unless you were born in a rich family. The story focuses on former criminal Max DaCosta (Matt Damon) whom is destined to make it to Elysium one day. After getting in a radiation accident at work, he is forced to undergo surgery by a ragtag group of thugs that give him an exo-suit to wear. The plot eventually follows a data heist which will get them to Elysium.The best parts of Elysium has been the cinematography, special effects and the action. The not so best parts is the writing of the story. There's not a lot of character development, the plot is too quick and thin, and some of the acting by Actress Jodi Foster isn't too good. My real problem with the movie is it's heavy-handed political message that's it's trying to force audiences to submit to. Elysium wants to be relevant. It wants to explore immigration and healthcare issues that America is facing currently. The execution of the socio-political commentary is done so poorly. It's explained through stereotypes. There's a good guy/bad guy. No gray areas. Throw in some action and you get the message by the end of the film. It failed to explore those issues in a complex manner. Another poor execution in Elysium was it's worldbuilding. It's set in the year 2154 yet feels very much like 2013-2014 with a few technological advancements. We see highly advanced guns, robots and some vehicles. Not to mention, Elysium itself but that is really it. Everything else felt too contemporary from the clothing of the characters to the overall atmosphere and the setting.In the end, Elysium is a a Science Fiction film that really could have been better. it had so much potential. The final product isn't bad, it just didn't meet up with Blomkamp's first feature, District 9.",7,1,2,29 November 2014
Lucy," Pseudo-scientific nonsense, A waste of time
","This is a huge disappointment for a Luc Besson film. The director of The Fifth Element and Taken. Lucy is a movie with a really dumb premise that has already been de-bunked. What if you can use 100% of your brain? Even if we only used 10% and somehow achieve maximum usage, we would very likely not be doing what is depicted in this movie. The main character is an American student named Lucy (Scarlett Johansson)living in Taiwan who manages to get herself in a drug trafficking operation as a drug mule. The drug that is put in her is experimental. After the drug package breaks inside her body after a physical incident with a trafficking henchman, the drug gives her the ability to do anything you could imagine by the time she achieves 100% usage in their brain. That's pretty much it. Morgan Freeman co-stars as a Scientist who is basically in the movie to explain the whole '100% of the brain theory' like a Science Channel program. I'm not even kidding about this. This goes alongside an action-adventure as Lucy finds out what is going on with her as the Korean gang that made her a mule tracks her down. The movie itself is short with a gimmicky, stupid premise put in with some action and even sprinkles of philosophical dialogue about humanity that's also present. LUCY may not be as bad as a DVD rental but I wouldn't waste time buying it.",4,0,2,29 November 2014
The Purge," A decent home invasion flick with an implausible premise
","It's got masked killers wanting to invade a home and it has an interesting backdrop. Set in the near future, A new regime known as the New Founding Fathers of America have allowed one night a year to be a legalized crime spree which includes murder. It's simply referred to as the Purge. In the real world, something like this would get shot down quickly but we are going to have to accept this for the sake of the movie.The social commentary behind it after all is quite interesting. The main character played by Ethan Hawke is a wealthy man living in a wealthy neighborhood. He supports the Purge and not only that, but makes a profit off the event by selling people home defense systems. Therefore, the rich are more likely to survive the Purge than the middle or lower class. The plot of this movie is simple. The main character's son allows a stranded homeless man in after a group of masked, college educated killers that have a hatred for the impoverished want to kill him. The killers want the homeless man and give the main character a chance to live by giving him over. There is also a minor subplot of another person that infiltrated the house before lockdown but I don't go into details to avoid spoiling the entire plot.With only a 3-4 million dollar budget, the movie does so little around this interesting but implausible premise. The best it can do was to tell a home invasion story, similar to The Strangers around this premise.It's an entertaining film by all means but don't expect anything too special.",5,0,0,1 November 2014
