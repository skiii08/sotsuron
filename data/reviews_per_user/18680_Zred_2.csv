Requiem for a Dream," Not all it's hyped to be
","I just watched this movie last night after reading all the great reviews on IMDb. I didn't think it was a very good movie in any way, not one I would bother mentioning to my friends.The fast motion sequence is downright annoying and wrecking to the movie. The audio is awfully annoying - especially towards the end when I found myself having to turn off the stereo and watching the rest of the movie on the less dominating TV speakers. It had too much sex and nudity. I never came to identify with the characters and thus their fates at the end didn't touch me emotionally. The movie did manage to do one thing right: Illustrate how psychotic you can become even from popping pills subscribed by a doctor. The scenes with the exploding fridge are good. The acting performance of the mother-character is downright awesome. But the movie as a whole = big waste of 1 hour and 40 minutes.",4,3,6,23 June 2007
The Hunger Games," Sigh...
","First, I haven't read the book. I was lured into watching the movie with little more information than the tag line and IMDb rating. This movie, while technically well executed, suffers from having a totally boring, predictable and unengaging plot. There's no doubt that I would have changed the channel had I not been stuck in the cinema.This title may be popular with 13-year-old girls. If you don't belong to that group, there are better movies to spend your time on. If anything, it made me want to revisit The Truman Show - a decent 'dome TV show' movie.And I never did figure out why it's called 'The Hunger Games'.",5,25,44,2 April 2012
