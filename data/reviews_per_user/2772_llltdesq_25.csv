Despicable Me 2," Good sequel which develops Gru as a character a bit more thoroughly
","This film was nominated for the Academy Award for Animated Feature, losing to Frozen. There will be spoilers ahead:This film more or less picks up where the first one left off (though you can watch it even if you haven't seen the first one). Gru is no longer a super villain, instead opting to raise the three girls (Margo, Edith and Agnes) he's adopted and going into business making jelly and not being all that successful.His assistant, Dr. Nefario, takes another job, preferring the old evil ways to the new ones. Gru is recruited by Lucy Wild, an agent for the good guys, the Anti-Villain League, who brings him in after tasing him ('lipstick taser!') and essentially kidnapping him. Gru turns them down at first and then decides to accept.Gru finds that he and Lucy have been teamed up undercover at the mall, running an operation out of a cupcake shop (Lucy has more and cooler toys than James Bond). They meet two suspects, one man Gru is convinced is one-time super villain El Macho and one named Floyd Eagle-san. Gru and Lucy break into El Macho's Mexican restaurant and run afoul of Macho's chicken security guard, Lucy ultimately foiling the bird and the two making their escape.Lucy and Gru hit it off after she rescues Gru from his blind date from hell and it sets up a beautiful sequence utilizing the song 'Happy', showing Gru as just that-happy, because things are going so well with Lucy. But events intervene.Eventually, the AVL finds evidence that Floyd is who they're seeking and they shut down the operation, with plans to drop Gru as an agent and send Lucy to Australia. So Gru deflates, starts moping around and winds up at the Cinco de Mayo celebration at El Macho's restaurant because Margo is infatuated with Macho's son Antonio. Gru learns that he's right, this is El Macho and he's the super villain AVL was looking for. Dr. Nefario is working for El Macho now and has taken (Minion-napped?) a huge number of Gru's Minions (who are all over this film) as part of his scheme, which I won't spoil here.Ultimately, Gru winds up a hero by derailing El Macho's plans. The resolution of the subplot with Lucy is perfect and there's room for a Despicable Me 3 (not to mention a financial incentive, given the success of the first two films and the most recent prequel's success at this writing, Minions, a film featuring the Minions).This film is available on Blu Ray and DVD and is worth watching.

Love and Death," One of Woody Allen's most entertaining and amusing comedies
","Woody Allen films fall into different categories-his early films verge on slapstick while still being bitingly satirical (Sleeper, Bananas, Play It Again, Sam, among others) while his later works generally fall into one of two categories: contemporary social satire or nostalgic period pieces, generally set in the 1930s or 1940s.  Love and Death is probably the most cerebral of the slapstick films and what I suspect a collaboration between Woody Allen, Ingmar Bergman and the Marx Brothers would have looked like had one ever taken place.  Sight gags abound along with the philosophical discussions Woody Allen films have as a matter of course.  It's a hilarious film that spoofs Bergman, the military, patriotism and, of course, love and death.  Most highly recommended.",10,51,60,1 August 2001
Casablanca," Everybody comes to Rick's.
","This is one of the greatest films of all time. There will be spoilers ahead: I doubt that there's anything I can add about this film which hasn't been said before (and likely said better than I'll say it) but I'm going to throw mt two cents in the pot in any case.There are many ways to comment on a film. One can discuss the storyline, summarize the plot, talk about the filming techniques/technical aspects or just say what you love about the film. It becomes both harder and easier when you're discussing one of the most widely seen films of all time.You can watch the film and notice the clichés, but then you should remind yourself that most of those clichés are clichés because of this film. I choose to discuss some of the supporting cast in this review, because Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, Sidney Greenstreet and Claude Rains have undoubtedly been justifiably praised to the skies enough already.This film is peppered with supporting characters, some of whom have notably sized roles, like Peter Lorre as Ugarte, S.Z. Sakall as Carl, Leonid Kinsky as Sascha (the last two providing much of what comic relief there is in the film) John Qualen as Berger, Marcel Dalio as Emil and Conrad Veidt as Major Strasser, the serious heavy of the film.Then there are bit characters-there's a pickpocket early in the film, there's Rick's girlfriend Yvonne (almost the only other female role of consequence in the film) and two married couples, an older couple who have a nice scene with Carl which is hilarious and a young couple, who are Bulgarians basically trapped in Casablanca without an exit visa. Their vignette permits the audience to see Rick's softer side and offers a nice bit of character development.All of the characters here have their moments and the only performance which just misses the mark is Sakall's as Carl. For me, the scenery-chewing Sakall does here is just a bit too much to completely work for me. Even then, he still does a serviceable job.Last, but by no means least, there's Sam, played by Dooley Wilson. Sam more properly belongs in the significant players with Bogart, Bergman and the rest, as he's probably been highly and frequently praised, as he should be. But I just had to say a few words about Wilson's performance as Sam. It's extraordinary. Most of Wilson's scenes are with Bogart and the two work together marvelously. The musical numbers Wilson performs are highlights of the film, particularly 'Knock On Wood' and 'As Time Goes By'. Wilson's supporting performance makes the film stronger.This film is available on DVD/Blu-Ray and is well worth watching. Most recommended.",9,1,2,18 August 2015
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," One of the best, if not the best, animated features of all time
","I absolutely love animation (not to be confused with anime) and Who Framed Roger Rabbit? is my favorite.  With Disney and Warner Brothers characters appearing in the same film for the first time, and Betty Boop weighing in as well, that would be enough.  But there is also a new cast of animateds in addition-Roger and Jessica Rabbit, Baby Herman and the weasels, et cetera. It's toon heaven on earth.  There is a very intricate plot that works as a comedy and as a mystery, characters who grow and that you care about and great special effects.  But what I love most about the movie is the action on the fringes.  I've seen the movie at least a dozen times and I always catch something I've never spotted before.  The movie comes flying at you a hundred miles an hour and there's so much going on in most of it that you can't catch everything the first time.  For some people, Toy Story is the best animated feature of all time and for some it's Snow White or Fantasia and there is a case that can be made for each.  But for my money, Who Framed Roger Rabbit? is the champ so far.  My highest recommendation.",10,1,1,2 October 2000
As Good as It Gets," 'You make me want to be a better man.'
","How Titanic beat both this and L.A. Confidential for Picture is unfathomable.  There is more romance in the line I quoted from As Good As It Gets in the subject line than Titanic has in the whole of the movie.  This film has more (and better) quality performances from its cast (even the bit roles), a better script, equally good or better production values (save for special effects) and will likely stand the test of time more solidly than Titanic.  Jack Nicholson chews the scenery (so what else is new?), but the character is off-the-wall in the first place.  Helen Hunt gives the performance of her career.  The script is intelligent, funny, tender and biting-a solid piece of work.  Big overblown epic beats solid character study most of the time, sadly.  Well worth seeing.  Most recommended.",9,4,8,18 December 2003
That Thing You Do!," Hackneyed, cliched, trite-but somehow, it works and you can dance to itt
","This movie is really, on the face of it,  collection of well-worn characters, plot devices and cliched, old scenarios and it should really just sink to the bottom with only a gurgling sound or two.  But, amazingly enough, it works just well enough to be worth watching.  Most of the performances are at least good and some are very good.  Liv Tyler does the best of the principal cast, but three of the supporting roles give it life and one of them all but steals the movie.  Bill Cobb as a jazz musician and Rita Wilson (Tom Hanks' wife in real life) as a waitress have very good parts and shine in their scenes.  But Obba Babatunde as Lamarr, the hotel doorman is great and all but walks off with the movie.  The music is very good all through the movie, with the title track getting an Oscar nomination.  It's played throughout the movie and is infectious.  It's got a beat and you can dance to it.  I give it a 77.",8,1,4,24 October 2000
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Still a most remarkable film after fifty years or so
","I just watched this film again today and I'm still impressed. There will probably be mild spoilers ahead: Frankly, with more than 700 reviews/comments on this film as I type this, there probably isn't a whole lot left unsaid about this film. But I watched it again today and just felt like making a comment here about this in any case.Most likely every fan of this has their own favorite scene(s) and I'm no exception. But what most impresses me about the film is the performance of Peter Sellers. He gets to chew the scenery with the best of them in his portrayal of Dr. Strangelove and he plays the milquetoast president with sublime perfection, but I actually like his basically deadpan reading of of Group Captain Lionel Mandrake most of all. He more than held his own opposite the dry yet still overheated and hilarious performance of Sterling Hayden as Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper. Sellers strengthens Hayden's performance exceptionally well without losing any ground on his own. My favorite scene in the film (by a hair) is Mandrake's exchanges with Keenan Wynn. I know the dialog almost by heart.A magnificent piece of work, with virtually nothing out of tune. Well worth watching and most highly recommended.",10,1,4,21 January 2014
"Monsters, Inc."," Beautifully animated, with excellent character design and development
","This is an animated feature produced by Pixar. There will be spoilers ahead:There's a great deal to like about this film. The animation is wonderful, the characters are well designed and the characters mainly have strong, well developed personalities, particularly the two leads. The voice work of John Goodman and Billy Crystal as Sully and Mike is perfectly meshed, the two working together to make their characters come alive.The premise is that monsters are simply doing their job when they scare children (monsters in the closet, under the bed and so on) and the power which runs their city comes from screams. Sully is the champ and he and Mike are a team. The chief villain, more or less, is another monster and Sully's main rival, Randall, a chameleon voiced perfectly by Steve Buscemi. There's an interesting, probably unintentional, resonance back to another film and role for Buscemi in what happens to doors to children's rooms when the children are no longer sufficiently frightened by monsters. But I'm weird, so I would make the tenuous connection.The monsters are actually more terrified of children than children are of them and most of the movie turns on this, with a small girl named Boo (naturally) coming through her door into the monster's city. Much of the film is concerned with Sully and Mike trying to return Boo to her room.The action is fast and furious, the plot is well crafted and executed and it's a fun ride. The ending is perfect.This film is available on DVD/Blu-Ray and is well worth watching. Most highly recommended.",10,0,1,9 December 2014
Duck Soup," Possibly the funniest film of all time!
","I am tempted to just put in the summary and go on about my business, because anything I might say about this gem of a movie will do it precious little justice.  But if this isn't the funniest movie ever made, it's in the top three!  The mirror sequence, the running gag with the motorcycle and the side-car, Groucho's song outlining the 'rules' of his administration-I could go on and on and I haven't even quoted my favorite line!  The Marx Brothers were comedic geniuses.  I love this movie to death!  Greatly, highly, certainly recommended.",10,0,3,29 September 2000
Edward Scissorhands," If Tim Burton never did anything else, this film would be enough to call his life worthwhile
","There is absolutely no way I can view this film in even a remotely objective manner, so I won't even try.  Like eveything I've seen by Tim Burton, this film is at one and the same time, warm and frightening, tender and heart-wrenchingly evil, uplifting and dark.  The good and bad in humanity are shown in stark relief quite clearly for everyone to see.  But in the final analysis, the most important message the film has to offer is this: Love truly does make the world go 'round and redemption and just living to see another day is a kind of victory.  There will always be bullies, just as there will always be kind souls who actively try to make things better (and who sometimes make things worse through their efforts).  The most important thing is to be true to yourself, treat others as you wish to be treated and that if the bad guys win, we all lose-including the bad guys.  Excellent cast, fine script and just overall a worthy effort not to be missed.  One of Vincent Price's last performances, if not the last.  I love this film!  Most highly recommended.",10,278,325,31 October 2000
The Princess Bride," A satiric comedy with humor and sadness, dark with the light.
","This film is an intelligent, sardonic send up of several genres that pokes fun (affectionately) at fairy tales, swashbucklers, love stories and basic conventions of film.  One of my favorite scenes is where Inigo Montoya first confronts his quarry after years of searching.  His adversary does the unexpected-and what most villains in real life WOULD do under the same circumstances, with hilarious results in the scene.  Basil Rathbone probably whirled in his grave!Not by any means Citizen Kane (we already have one of those, anyway) but a champ in its weight class, with a perfect score, a fine script and good performances.  Far more true to the flavor of the original fairy tales that it spoofs than even the best of Disney's takes.  I loved it the first time I saw it and love it more now.  Well worth watching.

Frozen," The Mouse's take on 'The Snow Queen' works exceptionally well
","This is an animated feature done by Disney Animation Studios. There will be spoilers ahead:Disney has been making animated feature-length films since 1937, with more than 50 done by the Disney Animation Studios through Frozen, in addition to now owning Pixar and having distribution on others. In recent years, Disney Animation Studios, while doing fairly good work, has been overshadowed by Pixar and Studio Ghibli. Frozen is the best animated film DAS has done since probably Aladdin in 1992.With Frozen, DAS takes Hans Christian Andersen's 'The Snow Queen' and gives it the Disney treatment. Frozen is incredibly successful on so many levels. It works as a full-blown musical, with a fine score and a very catchy hit song, 'Let It Go'. The animation is fantastic, it's the funniest animated film the studio has done in years.The characters are mostly well-designed and the voice work (spoken and sung) is equally exceptional for the most part. Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel, as Anna and Elsa respectively, are the leads and the heart of the story. It's essential that they do well or the film will sink. Their performances are fantastic.Beyond the two leads, there are a couple of romantic sub-plots and a couple of characters set up to be the comic relief. One of the love interests, Kristoff, has a reindeer named Sven and their interactions are fairly funny for the most part. Olaf the snowman is okay. He works better for kids than he does for me.Anna and Elsa are sisters who are also Princesses (naturally-this is a Disney film, after all). Elsa, the older sister, has the power to produce snow, ice and frost, which is a two-edged gift. After an accident, she and her sister fall apart, largely due to Elsa's fears that she will accidentally harm Anna.On Elsa's coronation upon her coming of age, various problems rear their heads and Elsa flees the palace, determined to exile herself. Anna pursues her sister, equally determined to fix whatever has come between them and make things whole and right, like they were when the girls were close.Through various travails and setbacks, the bad guy(s) are exposed, the sisters regain their close relationship and various mysteries are resolved. All the elements Disney films typically have are present, with a script strong enough to carry it all to a satisfying conclusion.I must admit that I like The Wind Rises a bit more than I do Frozen, but that's like saying I like chocolate ice cream more than I like fudge ripple. Both are wonderful, as is Ernest and Celestine. Those three, along with Despicable Me 2 and The Croods, form the nominees for the Animated Feature Academy Award, with Frozen winning.This film is available on Blu-Ray and DVD and is well worth having.

Lincoln," Lincoln is a movie, not a non-fiction text or documentary
","This is a film directed by Steven Spielberg. There will be spoilers ahead:This film is based in part on the book Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln. It is not a historical documentary, it is not a non-fiction history text. It is a film made for entertainment purposes first and foremost. Therefore not all events depicted should be expected to be the absolute and complete truth.You have a two and a half hour film trying to cover a period in history four months long. Did two black and two white soldiers speak to Lincoln, with one black soldier berating Lincoln about the treatment of Negro soldiers and then have two of them recite portions of the Gettysburg Address back to him? Probably not as depicted. But Lincoln spoke with troops regularly, particularly in the field. Could a soldier, particularly a Negro soldier have recited the Gettysburg Address, in whole or in part roughly a year after its delivery? Most certainly, given that the memorization of speeches was common in those days, the speech was reprinted in newspapers in its entirety and soldiers got newspapers in the field.Getting to talk to the president back then was much easier than it is now, in part because, up until Lincoln, no one had ever shot one. Lincoln was literally besieged by office seekers, because the president did, in fact, hand out patronage himself. Lincoln did walk down the street, he did cut a comic figure in the saddle, he did haunt the telegraph office and his cabinet was often hostile.Members of the House did, indeed, call each other buffoons, idiots and so on-on the House floor. After Preston Brooks caned Charles Sumner on the Senate floor, House members began carrying guns and knives on the floor. So much of what you see here is a realistic depiction of behavior at the time. End of sermon.The film itself is really an actor's movie. Daniel Day Lewis shines, but I must confess that Tommy Lee Jones stole the film as far as I'm concerned. Thaddeus Stevens was actually a much meaner and much less charming and affable as he appears here. Jones softens him somewhat and does a magnificent job. Sally Field is marvelous as Mary Todd Lincoln and David Strathairn delivers a magnificently understated performance as William Seward. Lee Pace does admirably as Fernando Wood, a New York Congressman and 'Copperhead' (a Democratic politician sympathetic to the south).The vote in the House is dramatized and most likely a bit too long, but fairly accurate for the most part, with some compression.This film is available on DVD and Blu Ray, with Blu Ray looking marvelous.

The Nightmare Before Christmas," Textbook example proving the old adage, 'The grass is always greener in someone else's yard.'
","This film, while far from Burton's masterpiece, is a delightful musical that in the end shows that, sometimes, we have things far better than we think we do and the other side of the fence sometimes looks better just because it's different, but that doesn't make necessarily wise to pursue someone else's dream because we mistakenly think we may like it more.  Tim Burton's fingerprints are all over this film.  Excellent casting of vocal talent, the score is great and the animation is marvelous.  A very good film and worth watching more than once.

Big Hero 6," I want my own Baymax!
","This is a feature based on a Marvel comic book and produced by Walt Disney Animation. There will be spoilers ahead:The descriptives for this film are legion. It's exciting, funny, poignant, sweet, charming, breathtaking and delightful. I had some doubts when I first heard about this movie. I thought it looked iffy. I was happily wrong.There are two brothers, living with their aunt, both technical wizards, the younger one (named Hiro) a 13 year old, super smart but at loose ends taking part in robot fights and getting in some tight spots. His brother Tadashi, wanting his brother to have some direction, tricks him by taking him to his school and getting him interested in getting into the same place.This introduces most of the other characters into the film, including Tadashi's friends, all of them technical wizards as well-Go Go, Wasabi, Honey Lemon and Fred-as well as a tech legend, Robert Callaghan and the most important and enjoyable character in the film, Baymax, who is Tadashi's big project, a medical diagnostic tool which is very empathic, capable and childlike.Hiro has to enter a competition to get in and comes up with a micro-bot which has enormous flexibility and range. It's an incredibly impressive thing, attracting both the attention of an industrialist named Krei and an acceptance letter from Callaghan. Hiro takes the letter and rejects the financial arrangement from Krei.Tragedy strikes and throws Hiro into a tailspin until two things happen: he re-encounters Baymax and finds out someone is using his micro-bot technology, which he thought was destroyed. This is where the film starts taking off. Hiro puts some additional coding on another chip into Baymax, adding more skills and making him more than just a medical diagnostic machine. The four introduced earlier form a superhero team with Hiro and Baymax, which ties back into the title.The film is at times reminiscent of the film The Avengers, which isn't surprising, given the source material for the film. The visuals here are great, particularly the look of San Fransokyo, the city this is set in. It's breathtaking.I really don't want to go into much more on the last part of the film, so I just have two observations left. One, I fully expect there will be at least one sequel coming in the next few years and, two, when you watch this, watch all the way to the end of the film, end credits and all. It's most definitely worth the time. The art under the credits is excellent and there's something nice at the end.This film is out on Blu Ray and DVD and is well worth watching on Blu Ray if you have that capability.

Toy Story," An affectionate love letter to toys and film
","This was Pixar's first feature-length film, the first full-length computer-animated feature film and the first film in the Toy Story series. There will be spoilers ahead: I could just say that this is a phenomenal film, a ground-breaking film and a must watch if you love film in general and/or animation in particular and leave it at that, but this comment would be rather thin if I did so, so I'll do a bit more here.I don't really need to discuss the plot, because, chances are, if you're reading this, you've probably seen this already. I'll do a brief sketch: this concerns a boy named Andy and his toys. Lifeless when humans are around, the toys come to life when none are in the room. Woody is the leader of the toys, but his place is threatened by a new toy, Buzz Lightyear. Andy and family are preparing to move. Through a series of mishaps, Woody and Buzz wind up being lost and must make their way back before the family leaves or be separated from Andy forever. After a series of adventures, they make it back and get on board before the family is gone.That's a simple story. The parts of the film are each so excellently crafted that it takes a simple story and creates gold. The animation still holds up, even after 20 years, which is an eternity in computer animation. The script is marvelous and the writers clearly show that they possess a love for both toys and film. The toys showing up in here are a mix of new (Woody and Buzz) and classic (Mr. Potatohead, Etch-a-Sketch and green army soldiers). There are gags referencing films as diverse as Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Wizard of Oz. Pixar also references the various shorts they'd made up to that point and TV shows like Star Trek and The Simpsons.The voice casting is spot on. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen nailed their parts. Don Rickles and Jim Varney were inspired casting choices and John Ratzenberger began an association with Pixar which continues today. The score and songs by Randy Newman are perfect, particularly the song, 'You've Got a Friend In Me', which goes to the heart of the film. It's just an exceptional film.The attention to detail is incredible. Even minor characters turn out to have a significant influence on things, like the mutant toys in Sid's bedroom (Sid and his dog Scud are the villains here, Sid being a rather twisted kid next door). The look of everything is astonishing, though it has aged in 20 years.This film is available on DVD/Blu-Ray is is well worth getting. Most highly recommended.",10,0,1,22 September 2015
Singin' in the Rain," Great film, with wonderful performances and a good script
","There will be spoilers ahead:This film has rightly become a classic, proving that the Academy Awards are quite fallible. A good case can be made that this was more deserving of a nomination for Picture than three of the five films nominated-including the eventual winner, The Greatest Show on Earth. That Jean Hagen lost out to Gloria Grahame can be chalked up to the fact that Grahame had three prominent supporting roles that year and won for the most dramatic of them in The Bad and the Beautiful. Hagen's turn was, in my opinion, the best of the year. Oh well.This film is so well known that I doubt I need to discuss the plot much, so I'll give a brief outline. A silent film star and his leading lady have their careers jeopardized by the advent of sound and the reality that her voice isn't ready for prime time and would sink them and probably the studio. He cannot stand her, while she's convinced she's God's gift to the world. His love interest dubs her voice for the star's in order to save everyone.Sounds clichéd and dull. Without the songs and the performances, it would have been forgettable. But Gene Kelly as the star, Debbie Reynolds as his love, Donald O'Connor as his best friend and collaborator and the incomparable Hagen as Lina Lamont, horrid voice and all, as the iceberg to the studio's Titanic, elevate the story and make the film magnificently fun! Hagen steals every scene she's in. Lina is crass, vulgar, crude, obnoxious, arrogant, vain, self-centered, mean and dumb-and those are her good points. Watch for Rita Moreno in a small role as Zelda, Lina's friend.Cyd Charisse has a significant dancing role in one of the major musical numbers and O'Connor has the funniest musical number in the film, with 'Make 'Em Laugh'. But the film belongs to Kelly and Reynolds, who shine in their leading roles. There's a chemistry between them which makes the whole movie believable.This film is available on DVD and Blu-Ray and is worth watching. Recommended.",8,1,3,28 July 2015
Toy Story 2," Fine sequel, if not quite as good as the original
","This is the second film in the Toy Story series of films produced by Pixar. There will be spoilers ahead: Given the success of the first film, a sequel was all but inevitable. The second film is almost as good as the first. Visually, it's a shade better, because the technology is more effective.Though the plot is probably familiar to anyone reading this, I'll give it a quick run-through here. Woody is excited to be going to cowboy camp with Andy, but gets damaged and Andy doesn't take him. The dreaded 'yard sale' takes place while Andy is gone. Discarded items, including toys wind up on tables for sale. Andy inadvertently winds up in the yard sale after he rescues 'Wheezy', a new character (a toy penguin with a busted squeeker).The first of three villains winds up stealing Woody when Andy's mom says he's not for sale. Al, who runs 'Al's Toy Barn', recognizes Woody as a vintage toy he's sought after to complete a set. When the other toys see Woody taken, Buzz insists they form a rescue party and go after him.Woody learns he's part of television and toy history. He meets the 'Roundup Gang'-Jessie, Woody's horse Bullseye and Stinky Pete the Prospector. Al intends to sell the set to a toy museum in Japan and he needs Woody to complete the set.The rest of the movie has dual threads-following the gang as they try to find and rescue Woody and the plans to take the 'Roundup Gang' to Japan. There are chase sequences, a sub-plot where Buzz winds up sidetracked and a different Buzz toy (who still labors under the delusion that this is real) goes with the other toys. New toys are encountered and Woody is rescued in the end.High points are the introduction of 'Tour Guide Barbie' at 'Al's Toy Barn', the entrance of Zurg as the second, rather minor, villain as Buzz's nemesis and how the songs are used. Hearing Robert Goulet's voice coming from a toy penguin is worth the price of admission all by itself!There are movies references and there's a wonderful cross-connection with the Pixar short, Geri's Game, which I loved. Just in case any of you haven't seen the film, I won't name the third villain, but I will say that, in true Toy Story fashion, the villains all have very appropriate payback for their behavior.This film is available on Blu-Ray and DVD and is well worth watching.

Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Still a magnificent achievement after almost 80 years
","This is the first animated feature length film produced by the Walt Disney Productions. There will be spoilers ahead:This is, in my opinion, the greatest animated film of all time. It is certainly the greatest animated film ever produced in the US. It's a remarkable piece of work and, for its time, a monumental undertaking. It was in production for over three years and cost close to $1,500,000, a massive amount at the time. It was a smash hit when it was released and won a special Oscar from the Academy. While it was nominated for its musical score, none of its songs were nominated in the song category.The story is quite familiar at this point, so I'll briefly summarize it here. Snow White is a princess whose stepmother is a vain and vindictive woman, jealous of her step-daughter's beauty. When the queen's mirror declares Snow White 'the fairest one of all', the queen plots to have her killed. The plot fails and Snow winds up coming to live with seven dwarfs, winning them over and taking care of them.The queen learns that Snow still lives and decides to take matters in her own hands, poisoning Snow with an apple which puts her in a deep sleep. The queen is killed and Snow is awakened by her true love.The animation is breathtaking and still looks great even after all this time. The songs and the score are catchy and memorable and the characterizations are excellent. This is a first-class achievement in all respects.This film is available on DVD and Blu Ray and is well worth having. Most highly recommended.",10,2,2,26 May 2015
Despicable Me," Funny and charming take on super villains
","This is an animated feature produced by Illuminations Entertainment for Universal. There will be spoilers ahead:This film features an interesting variation on the whole super villain concept. For one thing, the super heroes don't seem to exist. The story revolves around Gru, a super villain who hasn't really been terribly successful at his calling. His mother, banker and assistant take great pains to remind him of this as often as possible.A younger super villain named Vector steals Gru's thunder (and a pyramid) causing Gru's bank loan to be called. Who knew being a super villain was so challenging? Gru has cash flow problems, a lot of employees (most of them little yellow critters called Minions) and a deadline on his next project-stealing the moon, which has been a dream of his since he was a little super villain.Enter plot twist, namely three orphaned sisters selling cookies. Gru turns them down. Then through a series of events, he decides he needs their help getting a shrink ray from Vector, so he visits the orphanage where they live, 'charms' the rather obnoxious harridan running the place into letting him adopt them (a knowledge of Spanish makes one joke particularly good) and off they go to deliver cookies to Vector.The girls stay with Gru long enough to grow on him and for them to become fond of him in turn, until the harridan takes them back. Much of the rest of the film deals with the stealing of the moon and a race against time to get to the girls' dance recital, which Gru has promised he would attend.Vector manages to grab the three girls, demanding Gru give him the moon in exchange. There's a thrilling rescue of the girls by Gru and Vector's fate is most satisfactory, given that he's an arrogant twit. The ending of the film is rather touching and funny. I won't spoil it here.This film is available on DVD and Blu Ray and is well worth watching. Most recommended.",9,0,0,7 July 2015
The Iron Giant," One of the best animated films of the last fifty years
","This combination hand-drawn/computer animation film was the directorial debut of Brad Bird. There will be spoilers ahead: This is an extraordinary mix of two different animation techniques and it manages this amazingly well. Based on an excellent novel by Ted Hughes, though it was critically acclaimed (deservedly so) it performed poorly in its initial run at the theaters, probably because the marketing left much to be desired. It's managed to find its audience through home video and word of mouth and it now gets the appreciation it deserves.I'll just to a basic synopsis of the plot and discuss the technical aspects a bit. Set in 1957, just after Sputnik's launch, a huge robot crashes just off the coast of Maine. It comes ashore and eventually meets a young boy named Hogarth. After a series of misadventures and the robot's near destruction and recovery, Hogarth starts teaching the robot various things through reading him comic books. The robot is impressed with Superman.Needless to say, the crash of the robot and his actions draw the attention of the authorities, represented by a smarmy jackass working as an FBI agent and an Army general. Hogarth tries to hide the robot, which, given its size, is no easy task. He gets the help of a proto-hippie/beatnik/sculptor who runs the junkyard (this comes in handy, because the robot eats metal).The FBI and the military become aware of the robot eventually and through a series of misunderstandings and outright lies, the military moves to destroy the robot, even to the point of setting up a nuclear strike from a sub. The jackass government agent sets in motion certain destruction of the town, only to have the robot perform an heroic act to save everyone. The ending of the film is perfect.The technical aspects of the film are great, from a top-notch script through great voice work, magnificent animation, a perfect score for the film and the timing is excellent. The film won a good many animation awards and was lauded by critics at the time. It's a fantastic film.This film is available on DVD and was released on Blu-Ray this year (2015) in a 'Signature Edition', which I have yet to see. Regardless, this film is most highly recommended.",10,1,2,15 December 2015
Shrek," Not perfect, but quite good and hilarious quite often.
","This most assuredly is not a perfect film, but it is a marvelous send-up of the fairy-tale genre and the script is great.  This has romance, humor, a talking donkey, no car chases and makes fun of The Mouse.  What more could you ask for?  Movie spoofs and karaoke?  It has those too.  Most harrowing performance by gingerbread?  You betcha!  The voicework is spot on and even Eddie Murphy is enjoyable.  Great fun is had by all (except Michael Eisner-I'd love to have been a fly on the wall in Eisner's office the morning after this copped the Oscar for Animated Feature).  Very entertaining and well worth your time.  Most recommended.",8,9,13,15 September 2003
The Croods," Visually beautiful animation with an average script
","This film was nominated for the Academy Award for Animated Feature, losing to Frozen. There will be spoilers ahead: This is a very good film. It says something for the year in animation when a film like The Croods is, for me, the fifth best film in a very good field. The visuals on this are magnificent.The main problem I have is with the script. After about the fourth or fifth time we have the point that the father is completely and totally afraid of everything that's even remotely unfamiliar, I thought to myself, 'Okay, I get it! He's scared of anything that's unknown! Get on with other things'. This was probably 15 minutes into a film more than n90 minutes long. It detracted from the film for me.Essentially, this is about the Croods, a prehistoric family. It's narrated by Eep, the daughter of the above-referenced father. She's, if anything, more exasperated by her father's fears, no matter how well-founded they seem to be (her recounting of why they have no neighbors at the start of the film is gruesomely hilarious.Eep sneaks out one night, in defiance of the rules and meets Guy, a thinking caveman. She proceeds to wipe the ground with Guy, being stronger than he is. He tells her that destruction is headed this way and everyone has to head to safer grounds or be obliterated. When she declines his invitation to come, he gives her a shell to call to him with.Through various events, the entire family of Croods find themselves caveless and traveling 'with' Guy (in a running gag involving Guy and a log). Grug, the father, dislikes Guy immediately, for lots of reasons. Guy gets the upper hand and winds up in charge, which irks Grug enormously and it becomes a sort of competition between ideas and muscle.The family and Guy have lots of brushes with the danger they're running from and lots of funny moments along the way. Their introductions to fire show that father and daughter are a lot alike. The ending of the film is nice and permits a sequel, which is scheduled for released in 2017. I'm looking forward to it as I type.This film is available on Blu-Ray/DVD and is well worth getting. The Blu-Ray is particularly nice.",7,1,2,8 December 2015
Sweet and Lowdown," The type of film Woody Allen does very well
","In my opinion, there is more than one type of Woody Allen film.  There is the antic lunacy of films like Bananas and Sleeper, the serio-comic 'serious' film with 'meaning', like Annie Hall, Husbands and Wives and Deconstructing Harry and then there are what I think are Woody Allen's 'love notes', if you'll bear with the expression, films like The Purple Rose of Cairo, Bullets Over Broadway and Sweet and Lowdown, films as a general rule that are period pieces (generally the '30's or thereabouts) that are basically mash notes from Allen to something Allen particularly cares about, such as jazz in Sweet and Lowdown (specifically jazz guitar and Django Reinhardt).  The score is great, which is typical for a Woody Allen film. Allen does these little films vey well and they are almost always worth watching.  Sean Penn plays a self-centered, egotistical creep with talent. I will leave any further interpretations regarding the preceding statement to the Gentle Reader.  Why he was nominated for an Oscar escapes me. Samantha Morton, on the other hand, gives a sweet, if almost one-note, performance, which basically sums up the movie: worth the time and effort to watch, but a one-note film.  If you like this side of Woody (and I do), this is worth seeing.",8,52,60,2 October 2000
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," The person who wrote this review will be sacked! (No sub-titles-I promise!)
","There probably isn't much I can say that others haven't said already and at some length, I suspect, so I'll say this: what Rocky Horror Picture Show is to a great many people, this film is to me.  I know most of the dialogue, the songs the minstrels sing, the timing and so on.  I have probably seen this film more than any other and it never gets old for me.  Sheer antic lunacy on a par with The Marx Brothers and glorious fn all round (I feel happy, I feel happy! <Whap!>  Most stupendously, wonderfully, delightfully recommended. (When you're King, you have to know these things.)",10,2,3,26 September 2001
