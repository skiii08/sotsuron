Catch Me If You Can," Wonderful sense
","love the relationship between the father and the son -lio-. the color was amazing in most scenes, I remember the first time I saw it , felt sad and happy at the same time , thank god he become a good man at the end :) this made me have closer with this picture , there is some jocks that are very funny , knock knock .. who is there F** u, its not that smart but made me chuckle the 70's theme is breathtaking, i cant get enough of it. the music was epic too, loved how it was handled. loved also the attention to the details. the actress was very good at the role of naive girl. the near sink dance by the older couple was very cute at the end I concur :)",9,2,3,22 March 2015
Avengers: Infinity War," In Saudi Arabia!
","First announcement of releasing Avengers I was excited especially with the unbelievable rating -almost 9!-, but it's no different then any other super hero movie except this time it's 'to be continued'.
anyhow it's worth watching for a no brainier no emotion time, I still refuse to watch the guardian of the galaxy and captain America and Avengers require to know these character in advance.
I'm so exited for opening movie theaters in Saudi that's why I felt generous with the rating.
If I could make an exception, defiantly Tim Holland, will done!",6,0,9,14 May 2018
