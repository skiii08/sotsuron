Walk the Line," Excellent movie
","First of all I'd just like to say that this movie surprised me by being absolutely outstanding.Last year I took an American biography class and learned quite a bit about Mr. Cash. When 'Walk the Line' first came out, however, I wasn't very interested. To be honest, I watched because of Joaquin Phoenix (Johnny Cash) but realized throughout that this movie was going to be great, and it definitely was.Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon (June Carter) both give accurate portrayals of their characters. The movie begins when Cash is only 12 years old, quickly building up his character and his love for his brother, his determination to marry his long-time sweetheart, and play music. The trouble between him and his wife Vivian and family is heartbreaking, as is his growing addictions as he also rises to fame and tours with his band and June Carter.It's really hard to describe this movie in a way that will give it all the credit it deserves. The music is excellent, and it's amazing to find out that both Phoenix and Witherspoon played and sang all of Cash and Carter's song for the movie. If you are a fan of Cash or even just want a movie to watch and enjoy, this is definitely the movie for you. Cash's journey through all the hard times in his life and back to the top is truly inspiring.I give this movie a 10/10, no hesitation.",10,0,1,5 February 2006
She's the Man," Kinda corny, but very funny!
","I thought the previews were funny, so I went to see this movie, and it definitely lived up to what I thought it would be. It was corny at parts, but funny all the way through. I went with some friends and there were many, many times when we couldn't laugh hard enough! If you liked Mean Girls, you'll probably like this movie. It's drama-induced amongst all the girls, all the guys are attractive, and then there's the unusual twist of Amanda Bynes pretending to be her twin brother: it's what sets this movie apart from other funny, cheesy movies I've seen.If you're looking for a light-hearted comedy, you should definitely watch this film.",7,2,5,17 March 2006
