The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," Beautiful...
","Beautiful, beautiful film.  Every frame is a work of art.  Personally I feel that this director had one of the best eyes in the business.  His Three Colours trilogy another example.  But this film is just magical in its atmosphere.  Sheer beauty.",10,9,14,9 May 2003
