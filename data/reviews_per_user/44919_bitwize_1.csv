Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Simply an Awsome movie
","I think everyone who likes Starwars needs to see this movie.Admittedly, it had some flaws. It's not a perfect 10 movie. However, I don't feel it was designed to be a perfect movie in itself. I think it was MEANT to be an introductory movie for Episodes 2 and 3. There was some character development that I missed, but I have faith that episodes 2 and 3 will solve most of that. Lucas is taking one story and spreading it across 3 films.Over all, I would have to give the movie a A-. It's not a perfect A, but it's close!",Null,0,0,3 June 1999
