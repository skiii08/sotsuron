Skyfall," Average Thriller, nearly no Bond included
","i went to the cinema with high expectations (althought i was disappointed by Quantum of solace) and the movie started very well... good action szenes, cool bond (acted very well by daniel craiq) but in the szene bond dies (or seems to die), die whole movie died too.after the opening the movie was boring, with huge plot holes and very predictable.if you would replace Bond's name with Agent X or whatever this movie would have a rating about 5 or less.the only good thing (and the last piece of hope for this franchise) are the hints, they will go back to good (office setting like in the former bonds with miss moneypenny waiting for him).this whole movie has only one reason..replace M... and that is done by a very weak story, mostly 'borrowed' by the dark knight but without any flair.some examples of bad plot? Bond got shot by the enemy (and later used the shrapnel from it to locate the villain).. and then got shot again by an other agent (although he heard through his earphone, that there is someone going to shot at him..).. but he has only one wound.. or bonds masterplan to take M as 'hostage' an bring her to an abandoned house in the middle of nowhere.. without taking any guns or equipment with him.. and there isn't any sender or something else to call for help (although he used a sender to call the MI6 in an other szene). So his masterplan is, that the villain knows the location of M and will come there with a small army..and the MI6 is doing nothing.. great plan and succeeded with the death of M (as i said before..it semms to be the only reason why they made this movie..)",1,27,54,2 November 2012
