Blade Runner 2049," Dissappointing
","For those who were spellbound the iconic Ridley Scott original with Harrison Ford about the distopean future set in ChinaTown and the monolthic headquaters of the Tyrell Corporation. Donot watch this film .... it has nothing of the originality, atmosphere or beauty of Blade Runner. The characterisation is weak compared to the amazing performances of the original with Ford as leading protagonist - Dekker...a blade runner forced back into work hunting down replicants (synthetic humans) with Rutger Heyer, Daryl Hannah and Sean Young as the key androids. The film also lacks the mesmerising and iconic 80s electronica score by Sakamoto 'Do androids dream of electric sheep?' There is none of the Promethean like ending of the original between Hueyer and Tyrell .... between android and creator a metaphor perhaps borrowed from and explored by Mary Shelly's Frankenstein ....for Man's relationship with God.Disappointing Hollywood Remakes of successful films that cannot be improved are a colossal waste of money and usually end-up going pretty much straight to DVD, this is no remake and like the recent Star Wars sequals even contain Harrison Ford but films that attempt to add sequals or prequels to try and make successful movies into a franchise decades after the success of the original often suffer the same fate ......as the dreadful Star Wars prequels demonstrate. (One possible exception may be Mad Max Fury Road which although lacks the now aging Mel Gibson was always intended for release and is very much in the same vain as the original 80s trilogy, the Star Wars sequelswith their original (ageing) cast are also better than the prequals. If you have never seen either Blade Runner film watch the original then the sequel. The difference in quality is apparent. 
Sometimes it is best to leave well alone.",1,8,14,29 July 2018
