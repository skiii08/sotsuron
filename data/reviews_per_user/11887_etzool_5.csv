Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Very poor follow-up.
","As far as the general storyline, this film is OK, nothing surprising, and certainly not a disappointment.However, after the very good editing that made volume 1's swordplay enjoyable and relatively convincing, the martial arts scenes in this movie are difficult to watch.Yes, this is obviously in large part a spoof on martial arts movies. Yes, it takes some of the stock characters from such films and makes some great plays on them, and yes, it integrates this well into the story (even if it is amazingly cheesy).However, to watch Uma attempt to look proficient in hand-to-hand fighting is truly an unpleasant thing, and takes away significantly from the movie. I didn't realize until seeing this movie how well-edited vol. 1 was -- watch it again. You won't notice how incredibly awkward she is, because the cuts are so good that all you see is quick action, not her swinging that katana. In vol. 2, you see all of that in-between, and it turns out it's a VERY good thing we missed it in 1.Were it not for that, this could have been an acceptable conclusion. As it is, if you have any kind of background in martial arts -- or even martial arts movies -- you will probably find this film very hard to take seriously, even as a parody.Extremely overrated. Watch at your own risk; you may end up with an aversion to the first one as well, as I did, which is very unfortunate.",3,3,7,16 June 2006
Silent Hill," Disappointing, but not a terrible movie.
","I usually try to avoid getting drawn in by trailer hype, but I found it hard with this movie -- the trailers made it look like they really, actually had translated the game into a movie very well.This was, overall, not the case. The movie does a few things well, but retaining the most important aspect of the game -- its tension -- simply is not one of them.Silent Hill itself is very well-done. The environments, with few exceptions, were very well-rendered; this is the area that really shines as far as bringing the game to the screen. With the exception of a VERY poorly-rendered intro shot (panning around the main character), the outdoor 'day' scenes are very effective. The interiors are also very reminiscent of the games.Unfortunately, Silent Hill suffers from several problems which keep it from being a very good film.One is the acting. While it's not bad overall, there are a couple surprisingly poor, ham-fisted performances, and not from the actors you'd think. This might be the fault of bad direction, but either way, it's there and it takes away from the movie.Another is character development. You just don't get much of it beyond 'this is what's happening and this is who it's happening to.' All good stories are character-driven, and while this one is, it does not give you much at all to flesh them out. You will get about five solid minutes of backstory for the most important character in the movie... and you will get it right at the end. Not impressive, not effective.A minor point, and one that will probably only jump out at people who have experienced the games, is the minimization and poor presentation of pyramid head. You see very little of him, and at no point is he scary.Which leads to this movie's biggest problem. There is no tension here. It does not grab you the way the games did -- it probably will not grab you at all. There are 'woah, that's strange' and 'wow, that was shocking' moments (not many, but they are there), but it absolutely does not deliver on the games' main selling points -- the suspense, the tension that came from sitting in a dark room with the volume up, running around in the dark, knowing there's something out there that probably doesn't like you.a A movie theatre is a dark place... the volume is always maxed... and it's been years since I even saw the games. Even with these things going for it, though, Silent Hill the movie fails to deliver any sort of suspense.If you loved the games, you might not enjoy this movie. If you haven't played them, you have a better chance of having fun with this one.",5,1,4,23 April 2006
The Bourne Ultimatum," Ridiculous.
","I cannot believe this film has scored so highly. It's not terrible, but it's absolutely not worthy of an 8, and while I've seen a lot of really strangely rated movies here, this one's really hard to believe.1. It's the SAME MOVIE. Have you seen the first one? It was good. The second one? Decent. This one? NOTHING NEW.2. Did you watch the camera? Apparently the budget couldn't support TRIPODS. Even cameramen who weren't either on speed or suffering severe withdrawal were apparently nowhere to be found. There's something to be said for using the camera to affect a mood; it can't be said here, though, with a straight face.Such an uninspired movie with such a predictable plot should be enjoyed with popcorn and plenty of salt, NOT hoisted up with the top-ranked movies on this site.",3,2,7,1 October 2007
Ghost Rider," Painfully predictable.
","Right off the bat, I have never read the comics, so I have no idea how close this was to anything that's actually canon.Taken by itself, this movie hurts; I don't know if reading the comic would make it better or worse. It's certainly not the worst I've seen, and it did have some very funny moments.Unfortunately, the melodrama was laid on disgustingly thick, the acting was terrible (Cage was decent, but the rest of the cast was either completely inept or having a bad year), the special effects were sub-par considering the quality most CG-based movies are attaining now, and the plot was just generally uninteresting.The worst thing about this movie, the one that really drags it down and keeps the entertainment value low, is the complete predictability of every character and situation. Stock characters abound, and you never see anyone doing or saying anything inspired, interesting or even remotely insightful. Basically, the plot as well as the characters lack depth.A prime example is the beginning of the climactic fight (which, by the way, you'll see coming a mile and a half away). It's painfully scripted and (even in context) pathetically unrealistic.This is a popcorn flick -- not a good one, but a popcorn flick. Watch it for the no-talent eye candy and the amusing lines and deliveries by Cage, but do yourself a favor: Wait until it hits the dollar theatre.",3,1,6,17 February 2007
300," You will enjoy this much more if you ignore the hype.
","Well, I just saw this, and in two words and a contraction: I'm not impressed. Unfortunately, I don't know a thing about the story this is based on, so I'm not saddled with any preconceptions there, and I'm judging this movie COMPLETELY on its own merit, which I found really lacking.I went expecting a big ol' bloodbath with some witty quips, lots of freaks, badassery all around and no story to speak of.What I got was a flick that tried WAY too hard for the one-liners, a story that would've been bearable if it the narration hadn't been so forced, and characters that were painfully predictable. I wouldn't even mention that, but yes, this film DID try for plot, and it tried a lot harder than I had been led to believe by other people's reviews. I wish it hadn't; I would have enjoyed it more.The battle scenes were just vaguely amusing chaos with two notable exceptions: When they actually used the phalanx, it was cool, and when they were fighting that giant dude, that was pretty well-done. The rest of it was just dull repetition of uninteresting scenes; OK, a limb there, a limb here, lots of blood, woohoo. But wait! We can do slow motion! We can do slow motion! We can do slow motion! We can -- WE GET IT, STOP WITH THE SLOW MOTION. It works sometimes for dramatic emphasis. It was overused in this movie to the point where it actually interrupted the action, and that's all this movie had going for it to begin with.Another thing I wasn't impressed with was the cinematography. I don't know why people are so impressed. There are a few shots where it's obvious they were going for some kind of art-film appeal... mostly, though, it's just adequate. Not bad, but certainly not great. The mood was cool; I love the whole monochromish color thing, but aside from that... there wasn't much there.Bland choreography, hokey dialogue, uninteresting visuals... this movie just has so little going for it. It completely failed to engage me, which is actually pretty hard to do; that's a serious disappointment.",3,8,18,24 March 2007
