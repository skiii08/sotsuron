Blade Runner 2049," Time to settle the score. It was decent.
","I had no problem with length. I'm a fan of long movies like Stalker, but Satantango which is another movie that I like was really long, 9 hours.Big fan of the original Blade Runner and the book is my number one favorite.
Why 7. The characters were one-dimensional. Visuals at this time of age and post-Avatar can no longer be the foreground for a film, to me the visuals were too forced, spoon-fed 'look how pretty this film is'.
Ryan Gosling has no range, he always has the same facial expression throughout the film, he's good at playing psychopaths though.
The first two acts of the film were intriguing but the last third act fell flat, it was empty, just escalation, just confrontation, the 'good guy has to win' 'we're over budget time to wrap up' trope.
It lacked wildness, the bravery of the original.So to me this movie is not a masterpiece and I don't believe it will become a cult classic.
It is a decent film however. However I liked Villeneuve's Sicario better, and Arrival again fell flat in the third act. He has the vision but he's not an actor person and not and not as clever as Verhoeven or Cameron, when it comes to dystopian movies.",7,0,10,25 January 2020
10 Cloverfield Lane," Old school but works
","From the guy who directed playtest in black mirror, if I knew that before I would never hesitated to watch it. Thanks to positive reviews I did. It starts as an annoying old school psychological horror flick, with a mysterious music to boot hitchhock style. At times too old school, like scenes where a character can't find the right key to open the door to escape and so on. Then things get darker and the horror turns into terror as imagination of the viewer starts to run wild. The ending really messes with your expectations but in the end it works as you weren't hyped in the first place. It's not one of those films that was hyped to be great so you can't help but dread the thought that it might not, or worse it turns out to be the opposite. It's one of those films where you go to see it to find out what is it about with no expectations. It's low budget but production value is very good, think Moon.",7,0,0,5 March 2018
Avengers: Endgame," IT MADE NO SENSE. Sorry, it made no sense.
","They made it that way on purpose, so that most people would have to say 'yes, we think we understand, yea...' so not to look like a bunch of idiots. There's power in the denial!
But go watch it for the laughs, I'm not a type of person to cringe over a cheesy joke, but whoever was responsible for comedy relief this time around has gotten to me! Was it RDJ? He a genuinely funny guy.I rate this sci-fi fantasy:
6/10
-1 for over the top CGI,
-2 for deus ex machina,
-1 for trying to make me feel for too many characters! Because I can't do lazy writing.
and -1 for shameless AUDI plug but I won't go below 6.",6,6,10,30 April 2019
1917," Peculiar aura of nationalism over this one, lopsided, like it was funded by the army itself.
","I don't know maybe I have evolved or rather became disillusioned with my patriotic aspirations. I blame the internet, as it showed me that the enemy is within.The movie is well shot and the music is haunting, the first half of the film is expository with few words in between, truly mesmerising. I would also add that I can't imagine anyone in the role of Schofield other than George MacKay.But the plot, the script in general, and the ending felt like I was watching a cheap conservative hallmark channel drama on an extremely generous budget.The cameos meant nothing to me, oh look there's Colin Firth - we will never see him again, oh look there's Benedict Cumberbatch and his scar as you were, then that other guy in the end. Good acting overall but too scripted!Should you watch it? If anything it is only worth your while on a big screen, actually the movie has a surprising amount of jump scares ha! There's one moment in the film where I guarantee you will make you jump. So yea go watch but don't expect The Thin Red Line.",7,0,1,11 January 2020
The Martian," Cast away in space. Formulaic and sterile. Decent watch.
","I haven't read the book nor was the movie made for those who did. Also I know that lots of things were changed, or omitted altogether. So I write this review with no relevance to the original source.The movie consists of 1 part mars scenes and 2 parts people talking and looking at monitors. But that's okay, the movie had only 100ish mil budget, you got to feed the stars right?The movie ends like a fairy tale with cheers, hugs and applause... Have a nice dinner afterwards to complete the evening, call your parents and invite them for Christmas or something, because the elation simply won't last.The movie has a very positive vibe to it, you never feel that the main character is in any real danger, even when he humbly declares that he broke his ribs.The acting is rehashed from other movies and is not convincing, I assume it is how they got their roles in the first place, with Damon and Chastain coming straight from the Interstellar set, with not much else changed aside from scenery and the plot. I think I got used to Damon's fake tears by now, he does it good, so good that you realize he does it exactly the same every time.Cue in the visual explanation clich√© of a complex plot device, complex for you of course. Yes similar to the one in the Interstellar.Overall a very smooth, formulaic and sterile space drama with very little memorable scenes, at least not an hour later.No Sean Bean was harmed in this movie, they even let him to play golf in the end. 7/10",7,3,4,8 March 2016
