Mission: Impossible III," M:I3 was supposed to be a sure hit - sadly it was J.J. Abrams' own Battlecruiser that got sunk.
","Philip Seymor Hoffman is a great actor and Tom Cruise still has 'it' - the in-your-face -kind of a screen presence. Yeah, the cast is a good one but the movie leaves you completely hanging when it comes down to the plot - or rather the absence of one.Ethan Hunt goes on a rampage to save his wife but why the wife has been kidnapped, I do not know. Something about some important stuff Ethan has to steal for the bad guy... don't really know or care.Somehow the film really left me empty and not in any good sense of the word. The film just flashed on and off the screen; a couple of explosions and some shooting, some tech-jargon (Simon Pegg does a really bad role as the nerdy tech guy/comic relief) and trying-too-hard -to-be-witty -dialog.M:I3 was supposed to be a sure hit - sadly it was J.J. Abrams' own Battlecruiser that got sunk. 2/4",5,2,5,26 May 2009
Coraline," Great story, amazing visuals
","Coraline Jones (Dakota Fanning) feels that she isn't living the happy family life she should be with her parents (Teri Hatcher & John Hodgman). The family has just moved to a new area against Coralines wishes, the parents are all caught up in their work and there's not much to do for Coraline in the new, alien and secluded surroundings she's put in. She feels unappreciated by her parents – and she's more than delighted when she finds a secret door inside the house which leads to a different kind of reality where all her wishes seem to come true... Then the buttons come into the picture and everything goes haywire - you'll understand when you watch the film.Coraline's (2009) a stop-motion animation (with some CGI-thrown into the mix) and it looks amazing. The characters and the sets are well designed and brought to life with a great attention to detail. The characters are well animated and the voice work for each and every one of them is just right. Especially Dakota Fanning as the titular Coraline deserves extra praise – if she hadn't done a great job the whole film would have fallen flat along with her performance. Luckily for the film she's great in the role. What I also really liked about the characters was that even though how bizarre or 'over the top' they were, or regardless how few minutes of screen time for some of them was given – they all seemed to have something more than just the first and the most obvious 'layer' in them, something going on 'behind the scenes'. It brought that much more life into them and into the story itself.The film's look is very much alike with the one of The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) – and it's no wonder, the films share the same director: Henry Selick. The design is very Gothic- and dream-like and looks spooky and amazing at the same time. Along with some creepy design, the story isn't all kid-friendly either. There's nothing scary in it but in some of the scenes the tension does build up a bit.The storytelling get's into motion a bit too slowly and it get's overwhelmed at first by the amazing visual look. But still, Coraline (2009) has a great story to tell and the whole film is a fine example of a 'family movie' anyone can enjoy. 3/4",8,2,4,27 July 2009
Blade," Cheesy fun
","Blade (1998) is an entertaining action film that looks and sounds good - or should I say ”cool” because that surely has been the aim with all the sunglasses, swords, camera-run gimmicks and whatnots. Wesley Snipes plays (and growls his way through) the lead – a vampire hunter called Blade – and does it rather well. A lot of action set to the heavily tecno/hiphop -based soundtrack is what the film is all about, with some humour and drama thrown in time to time. Kris Kristofferson (Whistler), N'Bushe Wright (Karen) and Stephen Dorff (Deacon Frost) support in the cast. The film's opening scene is a great one and it's rather sad that the rest of the movie doesn't quite manage to stay on the same level – we've seen the best the film has to offer after the first ten minutes or so.Blade is kinda cheesy fun, a guilty pleasure of some sort. It's over the top in in a lot of ways (starting from Wesley's growling, continuing with the often ridiculous use of music and ending with the endless sunglass-related jokes) and does it shamelessly too. You might not love the movie or anything but somehow you take a seat on the sofa every time the film's on TV. 3/4",6,3,5,2 October 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," stealing people's money since 2009
","X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) is exactly what the title of the movie says: an origin tale for the character of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). It's a shame the film's so blatant, uninspiring and generic as it is because there surely were enough ingredients to make the story and the visual aspect of it in a much more compelling and intriguing way. I'm not a fan of the superhero genre or the Marvel comics and don't know much about the character of Wolverine but still there had to be more potential to the character than presented here if the character's supposedly such a pop cultural icon. The finished film is just an rush through the many meaningless and dull action scenes, throwing in ”familiar faces and characters” from the previous films like there were no tomorrow and keeping up with the tradition of poor dialog in the X-Men -movies.Hugh Jackman is a decent actor but he doesn't have much to do in the film other than constantly keeping a menacing or troubled expression on his face and showing off his trained upper body. Liev Schreiber supports as much as a guy running on four legs with extremely long and powerful fingernails can – so not that much. Rest of the cast slumbers their way through the flick, or at least the two or three minutes they each get ”on screen time”.The action is as mentioned above very uninspiring and something seen so many many times before: a lot of CGI and slow motion, not much imagination or creative effort. And when there isn't much in the film besides the action, you ponder what's really left; lousy dialog, dull camera-work and set design, poor acting and ridiculous story progression...Come on movie people, put some real effort the next time you try to steal the people's money. 1/4",2,2,6,9 August 2009
Terminator Salvation," Terminated...
","Fot the fourth installment of the Terminator franchise, McG took the director's reins and steered the series towards something new. Terminator Salvation (2009) brings the story into the future war between the machines and the remaining human ”resistance” (or terrorists...) - an event which the previous films have all flirted with but something we haven't yet fully seen on screen. It could've been great: a post-apocalyptic world, people trying to survive in any means they can, machines hunting them day and night without a break, intense atmosphere etc...But sadly it isn't great, it isn't even good or passable but very poor. There's plenty of action in the film; big explosions, big machines, big everything... but that's all there really is. The film, without a stop, jumps from another scene packed with action to another – and that would be just fine (like in the previous Terminator films) if the scenes or the action were imaginative and interesting or that there was an intriguing storyline being told in the process but Terminator 4 hasn't got any of those aspects in it.The lack of a real or interesting story is what brings the film down. I could take the poor action and even the lousy performances from the cast if the story was right but now everything just has gone south. And it's a bit odd because I thought the principle idea of the story was great and something not seen in the Terminator -universe before but from the very first minutes of the film you'll find out that something has gone terribly wrong in the writing process (or with the executives..?) and the story filmed here is lousy, full of plot holes and shallow characters, cheesy dialog and so forth.The cast (as I hinted above) isn't doing the best they can either; especially Christian Bale (John Connor) was a disappointment, Sam Worthington (Marcus Wright) not being that much better – and they're the two leading stars you could expect a good performance, no matter what the script was like.Terminator Salvation is (sadly) a generic action rampage without any thought. The great post-apocalyptic setting is waisted alongside with the legacy of the three (or two...) previous films (a great source material by the way, though used ridiculously poorly) so badly that it's criminal. I know they're making a fifth one but I've lost interest. 1/4",2,10,18,2 October 2009
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Hellboy 2
","When you have a hulking, bright red -coloured devil or rather a harbinger of destruction as the leading character and at the same time supposed to have comedic elements in the storyline, it's tough to make the film work. Guillermo del Toro and Ron Perlman made it back in 2004 with the great Hellboy – now they do it even better with the sequel, Hellboy 2: The Golden Army (2008).The film starts with a CGI puppet show – from the first minute you know you're in for something unique – recapping the legend of the golden army that once unleashed will bring the humankind to a quick and painful end. When a Prince (Luke Gross) of some sort from the Magical World starts to seek the means to control that army, it's up to Hellboy (Ron Perlman) and his team of extraordinary characters to put an end to his quest - and save the human race.Ron Perlman is Hellboy, there's no doubt about that. Underneath the thick layers of plastic and make-up, he's able to bring about a solid and rich performance as the titular character. The film of this sort lives and dies with it's leading character – it's Ron that carries most of the film's weight on his shoulders. The rest of the cast do as much as they can to support him; Doug Jones does again a great performance as Abe, Jeffrey Tambour is another highlight – the only one that really feels off is Selma Blair who seems to slumber her way through the film.The film is visually outstanding. The sets are highly detailed, the creatures look good and the CGI is (especially in some of the scenes) very nicely done. The art direction is great – it really surpasses the first film, which already looked great. The tooth-fairies early in the film are a great example of the imaginative creature-design that the film holds through-out.The film's packed with action, humour, great acting performances (for an action/adventure film) and great scenes – especially loved the 'guys night out' -scene. What else is there to ask for? 3/4",7,1,2,26 May 2009
The Beach," ...is best served during the icy cold winter days...
","The Beach (2000) has a bad name of some sort, not all seem to like it and many think it's a poor film based on a great novel. I disagree, I liked it. No, it's not perfect and the glorifying approach towards 'backpackers' what once might've been the coolest thing ever feels cheesy and awkward a decade later, but the film still has some great things to offer.The film manages to convey the relaxing though occasionally threatening atmosphere of the life in 'paradise' quite nicely, Leonardo DiCaprio (Richard) does a good role in the lead, the film looks visually great and has some imaginative tricks in it's sleeve and the soundtrack fits the mood of the film very well.That's the good, then the bad: the story isn't as engaging as you'd expect or hope - the story doesn't feel consistent and has some misteps along the way and doesn't seem to go anywhere in the end. The film starts out promisingly and constantly hints that something great is waiting around the corner but that never comes true; you feel mostly disappointed in the end. Not every performance from the cast convince either, especially Virginie Ledoyen (Francoise) and Guillaume Canet (Ètienne) were poor.The Beach is best served during the icy cold winter days when the sun barely rises above the horizon - it takes your mind to somewhere warm and beautiful for a couple of hours, though it's story might not really charm you. 3/4",7,1,2,10 January 2010
Collateral," Tom Cruise at his best
","Two lives intertwine on a night in L.A. where Vincent (Tom Cruise) is going through a hit list as a cruel and professional hit-man and Max (Jamie Foxx) as his unwilling cab driver. As the night progress and the tension between the two builds up, they surprisingly find some compassion towards each other regardless the situation.Tom Cruise does his best and most convincing role to date, he's the unquestionable founding stone of the whole movie. Jamie Foxx, Jada Pinket-Smith and others do a fine job too. The script is good (it has some missteps in it but it works well in all), the production values are in order and the soundtrack is a hit-on but what really makes the movie stand out is the beautiful and realistic cinematography; L.A. is represented as a lonely and distant city but also as something very beautiful and interesting to look at.The script isn't as solid as you'd hope: there's some easy and unimaginative steps taken here and there but as a whole, the script does work.Collateral is a fine film with a lot of thought and feel, a perfect showcase of Michael Mann's brilliant mind and eye as a film maker. 3/4",7,1,1,26 May 2009
Aliens," a great film.
","James Cameron had some big shoes to fill back in the mid 80's; Ridley Scott's Alien (1979) had been a huge commercial and critical success and James' job was to create a sequel to this film that was almost an instant classic in the industry. How to beat the first film and live up to the expectations set up so high by the first film and it's growing fan base? James' answer was to take the film into a completely new direction. The sci-fi horror was replaced with action (and even bits of humor), though still maintaining the scares and the suspenseful atmosphere of the first film. The combination of these elements turned out to be very much a working one and Aliens (1986) in my books is the definite 'Alien -experience' of the franchise. The film took the original idea and developed it into something even more interesting and thrilling. The film can be held responsible of creating a set of pop-cultural benchmarks that still stand sturdy and defining the way action and sci-fi was represented on the film screen for decades to come.Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has to face the alien race again when the connection to an outer space colonial settlement gets cut off. She unwillingly takes part in a rescue mission with a team of space Marines – scares, gunfire, screeches and some bits of laughter ensue.The movie's a brilliant packet: the visual style, the story, the dialog, the special effects, the sound and music – every aspect of it is able to stands on it's own (in a sense) but combined it sums up to something very cool to look at and listen to. The film has aged gracefully and still looks great though some of the effects look a bit too obvious and 'old' in todays standards but it's nothing that could hurt the over-all experience.The cast is great and it (along with the visual style and design) is what makes the movie stand out. Sigourney is brilliant in the leading role and she and the alien creatures are together what the whole franchise is all about – in Aliens the character is on her best, both on paper and in Sigouneys performance. Michael Biehn (Hicks), Bill Paxton (Hudson), Janette Goldstein (Vasguez) and Al Matthews (Apone) are all great in their roles as are the one's not mentioned here except Carrie Henn (Newt) who fails to live up to the role that probably was too demanding for the very young actress. She doesn't destroy the movie in any means but in some of the scenes her performance breaks the 'movie magic' and makes you very much aware that you're watching a kid playing a kid, not a kid being the character.Aliens is one of the most iconic movies in the history of the industry and it still lives on strongly. It's thrilling and entertaining and I've been rambling about for way too long. A Great film. 4/4",9,1,2,6 August 2009
Quantum of Solace," The film's one big action scene...
","The 22nd Bond -film Quantum of Solace (2008) continues right where the previous one, Casino Royale (2006) left off. James Bond (Daniel Craig) want's to find justice and reason for the loss of his love – and does everything in his powers to get to that point and reveal the people who are pulling the strings behind the scenes.The film's one big action scene with some brief story moments in between; what sounds horrible on the paper actually works really well on the screen and Quantum of Solace races itself above all the previous instalments of the franchise – and seriously competes against other action/thriller movies, which is something unique and marvelous for a Bond movie to accomplish. Though I have to say that it doesn't hurt if you watch the previous film in advance or at least read through the plot synopsis of it to get into the movie's story from the get-go – but you'll do well also without it.This is the second time Daniel Craig steps into the shoes of the legendary English secret agent and he really does a good job with it. As an character actor he's in a whole different level than the previous actors who have played the role before and in here - in some of the more mellow scenes - he get's to show those skills of his a bit. The role is still the same but he really has brought something different and refreshing into the character and it shows on the screen. And it's more than his blonde hair and blue eyes... Yeah, the movie is very different in all – and the director and the producers are the ones who call the shots – but still Daniel has found the best elements of the character and manages to make the movie that much more interesting.The supporting cast is good. Olga Kurylenko (Camille) does a solid performance, as does Jeffrey Wright (Felix Leiter) and Gemma Arterton (Strawberry Fields) is a great flash of the old Bond girls from the 60's although she actually really isn't playing one – but she looks and acts the part. Judi Dench (M) is great as always – balancing nicely between the caring and malignant mother -figure. The bad guys are a bit of a let-down, I'm especially getting a bit bored of the ordinary looking, non-threatening master minds like Dominic Greene (played by Mathieu Amalric) here, he resembles Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) from Casino Royale a bit too much and I hope they go after another kind of an approach in the next film – before it get's too repetitive.Also have to mention the great soundtrack: from Jack White's main theme to the scores for the most vicious action sequences, it all sounds good. This the first time I've ever said this about a Bond movie.The film's a bit scarce when it comes down to the story (and it's lack of depth) but the great action sequences and performances from the cast make up for it. Also they've kept the running time just right; the film's a great ride to sit through. James Bond is for the first time really heading into the right direction. 3/4",7,2,5,26 May 2009
District 9," 'We have everything but a good script. And that's A-okey.'
","The hype around District 9 (2009) was big a few months ago and I also in a way was taken by it: from the first released pics and teaser trailers I 'already knew' that this would be a great one. I wanted it to be something original and different, maybe even a modern classic of some sort. Sadly, the finished film isn't any of those things.The film's premise is an interesting one (minus the multiple plot-holes), presenting a very obvious reference to the apartheid and people's common intolerance towards anything 'alien' (and that being real aliens in this case), but the story that follows is a downslope from a somewhat good first half of the film to an unimaginative action rampage that destroys everything the first half had managed to accomplish.The film is presented mostly in a documentary -style but the feel of supposedly watching one is lost very early on in the film. It wasn't solely the plot-holes, the far-fetched story elements or such but the way the film was shot and edited – it's not a documentary I'm watching. Also, the beginning feels a lot like an extravagant episode of the Office (with all the goofiness and quirky characters presented) or something like that, rather than a seriously taken story of man who loses everything.The star of the show, Wikus Van De Merwe (played by Sharlto Copley) feels more like an unused 'white collar office worker' -caricature from some sketch -show, than a successful government agent leading the relations between the human race and the extra-terrestial refugees. Sharlto does decent job with the character even though the character's arc from a quirky pencil pusher to Rambo 2010 is everything but believable – or interesting.The film looks good; the CGI is decent, the hand-held camera style fits the events and the South African slum setting is well put together (though in parts unbelievably racist: the way the Nigerians are presented in the film is a very odd and miscalculated step in my opinion). Technically the film is OK but the story and the script possess all the elements that keep District 9 from rising above the sea of mediocriticy; heavy thematical underlining, lousy story elements, poor character development, unimaginative dialog and so forth. The premise offered an endless array of great stories to tell, it's kind of sad that the most boring, the most easiest and the most obvious one was selected. 3/4",6,2,7,21 October 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Epic proportions
","(I watched the extended cut) The middle part of the Lord of the Rings -trilogy, The Two Towers (2002) managed to balance nicely between the intimate character driven moments of the first film and the massive (and long) battle sequences and 'epic' atmosphere of the third film. The film also added a well crafted CGI-character to that mix, along with a wonderfully bleak story and a great soundtrack. The result was that Two Towers is somewhat the highlight of the trilogy; not bouncing so much around from scene to scene as the first or the third film and rid of the boring story moments of the The Return of the King (2003).The fellowship has broken and the film follows the three somewhat separate story lines of the remaining characters of the Fellowship of the Ring (2001), while adding new ones from left and right. Elijah Wood (Frodo) and Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn) are again the strong points of the cast, Bernard Hill (Theoden) also a positive surprise. Andy Serkis does great work along with the effects team at bringing 'real' life and emotion to the CGI -character of Gollum.The action scenes are fun to sit through, the drama keeps you interested and the definite battle scene is well build-up from the first words of warning to the last swings of swords and whatnots – the film's good fantasy entertainment. Like the other films of the trilogy, it lacks the deeper and more'humane' approach of the books the films are based on, concentrating more on the 'heavy on drama and action' -scenes but I understand the thought process behind that decision. I'm not so much of a fan of the books, myself so that's not a 'big question' for me.Peter Jackson (the director) managed to keep the multiple and branching story lines well in place, the film also looks great and contains a great otherworldly atmosphere throughout. It has some issues (I didn't find all the story lines interesting enough, the CGI in places is pretty awful in comparison to the best the film can offer, runs for a tad too long) but is a great movie experience to sit through. 3/4",7,0,1,23 August 2009
Taken," Neeson's show
","A former spy Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) travels to Paris where her daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) has been kidnapped and forced into the slave trade. Using his set of spy skills he tears down the city to find her before it's too late.Taken (2008) is written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen and directed by the formers protégé Pierre Morel. The film has the same kind of 'Besson' -vibe in it that there is also in the other projects he's been involved with and the film in that sense feels very homey and safe to sit through; the theme and plot of the movie on the other hand are far from homey or safe. The plot though is very thin and clichéd (especially in the beginning) and the characters are very narrow and one sided but the film's not really about neither one of those aspects: it's all about the thrilling atmosphere and Liam Neeson kicking some serious butt.Liam Neeson is great in the leading role and he's the best the film has to offer; if it had been some one else than him in the role I probably wouldn't have been interested about the film. He's convincing as an aged former spy, beyond his best years but still more than capable in killing and torturing people. He's not a good guy, just a troubled father who goes as far as it's required to find what he's looking for. The supporting cast does a decent job but the film lives with Neeson's performance.Pierre Morel does OK job directing the flick; along with Neeson's great performance, the film has a nice, fast pacing and the action is well filmed and brutal enough to fit the bleak situation the characters have to face.This is Liam Neeson's show whether you like it or not, there's no question about that so it helps if you like the guy. It may be tough if you don't because the films assets are very much limited and Liam being the biggest one in that bunch. 3/4",6,0,0,1 August 2009

Nice to see him in a lighter and more funnier role for a change, not i.e. eating brains or mentoring some rookie agent with an iron fist.Wouldn't expect this kind of 'free-roaming' humour from a story which sounds very conservative and 'righteous' on the paper. A real gem actually, I don't want to spoil the surprising story-elements of it.The film follows the based-on-a-true-story-ish tale of one Burt Munro (Anthony Hopkins), a Kiwi who want's to build the fastest Indian motorcycle in the world.

Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," This time the robots transform to a ball of waste.
","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009) is a perfect example of a movie that's sole purpose is to make mo'money for the studio (and that's exactly what the film did). The film gave the audience everything that was already seen in the first film, this time just in a much more bigger scale than before – it was like an updated version of the first Trasformers (2007) with no original ideas to add.Where the first film was OK brainless fun, this one is not; the jokes, the action, the story – everything feels very much forced and pre-calculated, there's no surprises or any signs of imagination or real effort. I consider Michael Bay to be a decent director and great in making what he does best; cheesy Hollywood action movies (like The Rock (1996)), but Transformers 2 just feels so tedious and breathless that it was even a bit of a surprise considering who was holding the reins.There's not much to the story: Sam Witwicky (played by Shia LeBeouf) goes off to college, comes across with some important information about the Transformers' ancient past and then get's chased by all kinds of shape shifting robots... A lot of explosions accompanied with cheesy music ensues. The rest of the cast from the first movie makes a return, though most of them having little if anything to do on the screen, Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) being the most obvious example. The cast does a decent job but the enthusiasm found in the first film was all gone, the often ridiculous dialog possibly being one reason for that.Transformers 2 lacks a real script and real effort which made the film unsalvageable even by the good visuals the film has to offer through-out. The explosions and the robots all look good but made hollow by the mindlessness of it all: the film's like a picture gallery or a showcase of what's possible to do in today's CGI with no meaning beyond that point. I had a horrible experience with the film. 1/4",1,4,12,24 October 2009
Defiance," Could have been a lot better
","Defiance (2008) tells the story of the Bielski brothers who constructed a community of their own in the Belarussian forests during the Second World War and fought against Nazi Germans in the process. The film is based on a true story which I'm not very familiar with but I'm sure the Hollywood studios have had their hand in the mix because the finished story here has a very overly 'heroic' theme in it and the story feels very one-sided and 'simplified for the masses'. There's multiple scenes which try to show different sides to the story and the events at hand and try to throw some shades of gray into the otherwise black and white way of seeing the world but all those scenes suffer from a heavy underlining and they only scratch the surface of the issues that should have been explored more deeply - like the tension between the campers, the nature of the Nazi soldiers, the nature of the Jews etc. This all ends up to the fact that the story told here is a very shallow one and feels through-out very 'Hollywood-ish'.It's no surprise that the story feels so shallow: Edward Zwick's (director, co-writer) isn't the most gifted man working in Hollywood. He seems to do the same movie over and over again; The Last Samurai (2003), Blood Diamond (2006) and Defiance feel very much the same when it comes down to the theme and nature of the stories and the films. The films even have the same gritty look that admittedly works.The cinematography, editing and the visual look (with sets, wardrobe etc.) are the film's strongest sides. Everything looks appropriate and the editing grabs you along for the ride. Edward knows how to make interesting looking Hollywood films, I just wish he would give as much attention to the story and the dialog as he gives to the visuals.Because the dialog and acting (along with the story) were the things I had the most issues with. The dialog is horrible: why, oh why did they decide to make the characters speak bad English with a heavy 'East European' -accent? Why not make them speak English right or make the whole film with the other languages and put some subtitles on it? I mean, they speak horrible and barely understandable English to each other – does the accent bring some value to the film? Does it make the film feel more original or what's the point? Or were they just hiding their lacking writing skills by producing simple and horrible sounding dialog? At least it's a nice way to get a way with it...Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber as the Bielski bros. make the best they can with the bad dialog written for them and they manage to do a decent job with it, the rest of the cast doesn't really deserve any praise.Defiance is a very mediocre and uninspiring film that lacks any real thought or emotion. It looks good but it doesn't have anything to say or comment on anything – it just 'is'. The short action scenes aren't very interesting and the CGI used in them won't be bringing any awards home. The film relies heavily on drama and the interaction between the characters which all is ruined by the garbage they call dialog. Could have been a way better film. 2/4",5,33,60,20 August 2009

","...is a perfect comic book adaptation though it made almost a shot-to-shot transition from the paper to celluloid. It's noir, it's cool, it's brutal, it's sexy - it's black and white, with dashes of colour.Sin City brings together three separate story lines, each of them as interesting as the other - and forms a working combination with three different kinds of characters, with three different kinds of an approach to the world of sin. It's a great ensemble of a cast, Hollywood's biggest names filling the screen and pulling it off - Bruce Willis, Benicio del Toro, Michael Madsen, Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy etc. - though Clive Owen has always been a really big question mark for me when it comes to his acting talent. Elijah Wood and Rutger Hauer in their small roles deserve extra praise. All them aside, the real star of the movie is undoubtedly Mickey Rourke as Marv, the hulking thug. Even from under all that make-up and plastic, Mickey is able to deliver the best and most solid performance in the whole film. He's truly believable as a comic book caricature - which is something marvelous to accomplish.The movie excels visually - the black and white world with some coloured highlights is a refreshing approach - the play between light and shadow is a beautiful thing to look at and I especially loved the very 'comic-bookish' - all black character figures against the pail white background - segments. The angles, the sets, the camera-work - it's all good and really separates this as a comic book filmatisation rather than a film based on a comic book. Sin City was filmed against a green screen from start to finish with very little real set props to be truthful visually towards the source material - and it occasionally shows pretty obviously as the CGI and the real life characters don't always blend as good as you'd hope.Still, Rodriguez and Miller have done something really astonishing with their film and I'm ever so eager to see a sequel. 3/4",7,0,0,26 May 2009
