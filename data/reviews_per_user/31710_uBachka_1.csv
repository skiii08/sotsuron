Hereditary," well crafted and unsettling movie
","This movie is very well crafted and has extremely good acting from both Toni Colette and young Milly Shapiro. First half of the movie has incredible emotional depth and also some very disturbing imagery. But when the plot starts to unravel, it becomes conventional horror movie and it loses much of the tension that made first half so good.",7,1,2,9 September 2018
