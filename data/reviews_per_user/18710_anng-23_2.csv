Hereditary," How do I say I loved this film without sounding deranged...?
","I have nothing but love for Ari Astor. I saw this film before Midsommar was released, and read Ari's brief discriptions of the themes for the two films only after watching the latter. Hereditary is discribed as being a 'family drama', where Midsommar is discribed as a film about a 'break-up' . And nothing could be more accurate in both cases...and THEN some!As with Midsommar, I read a lot of  reviews slating this film as garbage. As with Midsommar, I can't help but feel a bit of pity for those who saw this film, and neither understood nor appreciated it for the true, deep-seated terror it can conjure.Although I am a huge fan of the traditional jump-scare and gore horror genre, I am pleased to come across films like this, in that the slow, atmospheric story telling brings to mind films like Rosemary's Baby with an extra helping of melancholy and hopeless dispair.And the fact that the true horror does not necessarily lie in the supernatural (which there is a sufficient degree of), but in the roots it holds in reality and the issues humanity deal with in the real world. That is, for better or worse, where true horror lives; it comes from within us, more than without.I never felt the need to register for membership until now, after having seen this film and Midsommar. I felt obligated to join in order to weigh in on these films; these are under-appreciated masterpieces, deserving of a better, more emotionally intelligent audience to judge it than some of the one-dimensional minds that could not appreciate it for what it is worth.An amazing director; an amazing cast, both of whom fully succeeded in conveying the story being told and leave you reeling for months.",10,3,7,21 October 2019
Midsommar," People saying this movie sucks have ZERO perspective or depth...
","So, I'm truly horrified by the amount of people wanting to negative-score this film... It's your opinion and prerogative to dislike it, but noting this as 'garbage' is overstating by a long shot. I think if that's the first reaction this film draws from you, you clearly don't understand what you've experienced and don't have the emotional maturity and intelligence it takes to appreciate this Ari masterpiece. Needless to say, this film is disturbing, moving and mortifying on so many levels that you can't help but be blown away by the narrative and it's after-shocks; especially since it burns slow in such a way that, even if you see the punches coming beyond the normal sense of anticipation, it remains punches that knock the wind out of you in spite of itself.And what's even more terrifying is that the horror therein lies in its solid footing in reality. It almost all takes place in broad daylight, which is also scary as hell.Yes, my stomach churned more than once due to the less often gore there, but, as a Bi-polar myself (it playing a small but significant role in the story), this is a film that sent my mind racing from the get-go.Realistic, psychological terror and dispair you cannot look away from. This one will stay with you and may even haunt you a little if you let it.For my part, I love this film for probably all the wrong (or maybe right) reasons.",10,13,21,21 October 2019
