Mission: Impossible III," This is the best action flick ever, and is way better then the first two!
","This movie is definitely a must see! Way better then the first two and is just full of action, it will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat! The movie actually starts out with a scene from the end and then goes back to the beginning of the story and has the movie normally. I think this was very affective and the start scene is very dramatic and leaves you wondering how did it get that point. Cruise once again portrays the character perfectly, and none of the other cast disappoints. The dialog is good and has no corny lines, i thought the end was really cool, but i know that lot's of people were disappointed with it. if you are only going to see one action flick this year make it this one!",9,2,4,20 May 2006
Transformers," Transformers is amazing!
","I walked into the theater wondering about Transformers, I knew that it would either be one of the worst comic-book movies of all time or one of the greatest. It turned out to be the latter. The sound effects were awesome, and the special effects were top-notch. Combines, they made a very realistic effect, and after the first ten minutes I knew I was in for something really special. The storyline was even better. I wasn't a huge fan of the original series (I am only 13) but I know a lot about it, and although I admit that some of the robot designs were dramatically changed, I think that it was for the best. Overall, I recommend this film to anyone who has any taste for good movies. I can't wait for the sequel!",10,1,6,3 July 2007
