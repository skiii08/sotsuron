The Blair Witch Project," Excellent
","Very offbeat horror movie. And it has the touch of realism - so much so that when it first came out, people weren't sure if it was real. I see ots of people griping about it here. Maybe they prefer the slasher things that Hollywood churns out. Me, I hate modern Hollywood movies and modern Hollywood acting. This one is unusual...and terrific!",10,2,3,22 December 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Bored Of The Rings
","I really wanted to like it. It could have been great. It had goodacting, beautiful scenery, and no politically corrected racial andsexual messages.The problem was that it was way too Hollywoodized. Non-stop BS action- scenes, fight scenes, war scenes, stuff blowing up, doopy littlehobbits and dwarves beating up entire armies, one after the other,taking no casualties, very predictable, very boring (the book hadsome of these problems too). The camera constantly moved very rapidly over complex overly immensecomputer generated images, hard to focus on, hard on the eyes,ultimately rather meaningless.The charm of the book wasn't there, the hominess of Hobbiton, thewarmth of Bree, no Tom Bombadill, there was virtually no characterdevelopment. Basically it was one predictable overly loud and melodramatic battleafter another.Too high a decibel level - my complaint about most modern movies -are constant movie goers all deaf by now? - especially the pre-filmcoming attractions advertising the latest twisted Hollywoodpropaganda monstrosities.Yeah, it could have been really really good if they slowed it waydown and quieted it way down...Love those elvish women!P.S.  *Bored of the Rings* is a hilarious parody of Tolkein's *The Hobbit*.",3,1,3,5 January 2002
Titanic," What a waste!
","The special affects were awesome! The acting and script were a disgrace. Sort of a juvenile Stalinist propoganda piece. Watch 'A Night To Remember',1958, to see a GREAT movie about the Titanic, a movie suitable for those older than age twelve.",1,1,5,27 April 1999
