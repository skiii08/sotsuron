Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A very mixed bag--of garbage
","Regarding one British reviewer who commented that Borat reveals 'a society just brimming with hate' or whatever, just once, just once I'd like to see some film maker put the damn shoe on the other foot. Preferably a European fed up with his culture's random snobbery, maybe he'd find credibility with old world audiences. Any asshole (like his eminence Michael Moore, for example) can play around with allegedly off the cuff documentary footage to construct his own ugly picture of any society-and I do mean ANY society. How many shots, I wonder, did Mr.Cohen need to take to arrive at his contrived assemblage of supposedly representative vignettes of US manners and mores? Actually, some of Borat's victims seemed enormously tolerant of his bizarre provocations. But interviews with intelligent, pleasant folks wouldn't make for a very funny film, would they? I'm sure there are plenty of brilliant intellects out there (you know who you are, you've never even been to the US, just like your culture hero LVT) who would say that all of us were as dumb as the rodeo guy, since they value their own preconceived ideas about us more than any form of actual observation or interaction. Such persons, when they do actually encounter US visitors, are often wickedly skilled at doing and saying things that will only make these encounters fit into their preconceived notions about what proper transatlantic relationships should be. So many seem to believe that THEY know the true realities of life --they possess the truth with a capital T, and we are only allowed to worship their sacred opinions from afar, never to question, only obey, like good little colonials. I know these things--I've traveled in Europe several times. I have never ceased to be amazed at the sheer arrogance, the rudeness and the supercilious, vicious snobbery I've encountered as an American. In Europe I learned what it felt like to be treated like a minority--such behavior is never excusable, by politics or anything! I do not behave like the stereotypical ugly American. Plenty of Americans do read books, do object to the war in Iraq (isn't it obvious?) and some of us (such as myself) actually know where Kazakhistan is! Its in Central Asia, its a very large country, and the people there don't look like Caucasian Romanians, or European gypsies, either! Cohen is a talented performer who seems not only to be chronically lazy with the cheap laughs-he is also unaccountably addicted to potty humor of the lowest type. He is capable of much more, but perhaps his own issues (being Jewish and foreign, perhaps) prevent him from accessing any 'higher' levels of creativity (higher than the anus, I mean). Having said all this, there are some clever ideas here which get flushed down the drain about 20 minutes into the film. Some of the grossness is actually amusing (even the awful nude wrestling scene, I confess). But the potty humor dilutes the film's satiric impact, and all the random story threads (making fun of absolutely everyone at all times, for example) make the whole deal look like a giant spit wad, composed of bits and pieces of all things good, bad or indifferent. As I said before, Cohen is a talented performer, given the right material, which this certainly isn't.BTW, if this post sounds like a diatribe (yes, yes I do know what that big word means), it is! This particular innocent, when abroad, was never impressed with old world 'wisdom' or whatever you'd call it. Not that I didn't have pleasant experiences, but somehow the bad stuff always stays longest in the memory.....",5,6,11,11 July 2007
Les Mis√©rables," A real snooze-fest
","Like some of the other posters, I cannot believe some of the good reviews this film has gotten. Based on the classic novel by Victor Hugo, the entire story is told with music - and spectacularly boring music it is, at that. Any high school kid (with or without a music background) could come up with stuff like this. Anne Hathaway sings well, Russell Crowe (famously) does not. He has the range of a bull moose snorting angrily through a foghorn. Most of the cast try really hard with this material, but major plot points are obscured (or ignored) by poor writing. It is never a good idea to render an entire story, with all its dialog, in music. If you don't want every detail shouted at you in feverish pitch, avoid this thing like the plague. I kept waiting for this to get better - and it never, ever did. The production values are OK, but the whole thing seems endlessly long, and by the end, I was just waiting for the whole mess to be over! Don't waste your time - see the wonderful 1930s version (no music there, thank God) with Fredric March and Charles Laughton (as the evil inspector). A true classic, that was.",1,3,8,10 August 2015
