The Blair Witch Project," Fear is in the mind
","Not since Hitchcock have directors realized that fear and thrill are not the same. People attending Blair Witch with the anticipation of chainsaws, bloody knives, and a jump a minute will be gravely disappointed. Fear is the gnawing in the pit of your stomach when your boss tells you in the morning he wants to see you at quitting time. Fear is when your usually-punctual child hasn't come home, and it's well after dark. Fear is what you can't see and don't know. Fear is what Blair Witch serves. In spades. I saw it twice. The second time was as nerve-wracking as the first. I won't see it again. This movie will be a classic.",10,1,2,11 September 1999
The Matrix," What monster is the Internet, shambling forth to be born?
","Shakespeare it ain't, but if you're a fan of the Die Hard or Terminator series, you'll love this movie. The special effects are outstanding, and worthy of Oscar note, the acting is solid, and the storyline is credible. For those moviegoers who have ever pondered the question of what =is= real, this film's dysutopian look at what is to come will provide food for thought. My computer is continuously online, as are millions of others around the planet. Can it be long before =something= wakes up?",Null,0,0,15 September 1999
