Angels & Demons," Definitely better than 'The Da Vinci Code,
","Started watching this movie, i personally had expectations of thrill and unfolding mystery in the offing. It sure did justify itself on all those grounds. It is starkly different from its predecessor 'The Da Vinci Code' which was too much information in very less time. It would not be wise to go for theatrical version of it and I would highly prescribe renting a DVD and do a 'sit back and watch'. Also, this would not take much of 'rewind and replay' as The Da Vinci Code demanded. In short I would say; its a good whodunit and you would enjoy watching it.One thing i could not digest; In the movie, it was told that antimatter explosion could create explosion and consequences similar to that of a nuclear explosion. But in the end when explosion actually happened, though it was very high in the air, it did not do much.",8,1,2,28 August 2009
Se7en," End was not enthralling
","USP of the movie: Basic story line Worst part: Though many viewers would not concur with me, but movie ended like a damp squib. It was more like an M Night Shyamalan movie, which ends and sort of nobody knows that it ended; till you get the closing titles ;)This movie revolves around a psychotic serial killer, who is shown inspired by Dante's (Mythological) act of punishing doers of 7 deadly sins, by using their own sins as the means of mutilation.The whole plot was brilliant and this is one of those movies which leaves indelible memories in the viewers mind. Nothing wrong in the end though; well i myself could not think about a better ending from hindsight but candidly it gave me the feeling that end could not live up to my expectations. Though, there would be people who would strictly be of different opinion. It would have been a brilliant brilliant novel, but showing it on the screen has taken patina off.Though, this movie certainly is worth watching. But please complete it in one sitting. I would give it 7 on 10.",7,0,1,19 September 2009
City of God," Must watch!!!
","This title would sure send tremors down the spine. If you get your hands on the original reel ( which you should ), its very fast paced and does not matter at what point you start watching it, you would certainly find it intriguing. Though, I would certainly tell everybody to watch it from starting. Here are a few points which would tell you more about the movie: Interesting plot. Brilliant Screen play. Fast paced story, gives less time for audience to get out of the trance. Good amount of graphic content. Backed by fair enough acting. Dramatic events. Kinda motivational. watch it for yourself. I rate it handsome 9 points and recommend highly as a must watch.",9,0,1,8 July 2010
Saw," One of the best thrillers
","Though I saw it pretty late, the best thing was; i had 'Saw 1' through Saw 5 all the titles with me and was able to see it as a daily soap for ten odd days. One thing very interesting about Saw is the Plot. Lot of conversation in the closed room and only a couple of characters; Still I guarantee that you would not feel bored. Viewer would for sure see something new in the movie, never seen in other commercial thriller movies. Movie contains gory scenes with a lot of graphic detail making it not so obvious choice for underage and persons who barely can take blood.The story primarily revolves around a couple of characters in a packed room trying to find their way out. Thrill is they have limited time and clues are really hard to find by. You as a viewer would be biting your nails most of the time during the movie. Though the plot used is highly unrealistic, you would not have time to think about that part. Movie is fast paced and gives very less time for emotions and drama. Everything in the movie is related to plot and its less wastage of screen time. It certainly is kind of movie which you would want to discuss with your friends. and i would rate it as a very good thriller. And yes, you may want to try watching it at night; best time to enjoy this movie.",9,0,1,9 September 2009
The Shawshank Redemption," This movie not only had a good story but the story telling also was commendable.
","This movie not only had a very good story line, but also the way story was told to the audience was commendable. i have not seen many movies which you want to watch again, but this sure was. After you watch the movie and know what Andy actually was upto, you would want to actually watch it again to see how good actors (especially Andy) acted in those scenes. Movie revolves around Andy who is a hot shot banker, convicted for his wife's murder and subsequently sent for two life sentences back to back in Shawshank Prison. Andy who by his level of education and IQ gets gifted with both friends and enemies inside the walls, gels up well with Red, who gets a lot of things done for Andy. Warden also is impressed with Andy and starts a scam with his help to launder money into his pocket. In between, the brawl with 'gang of sisters' the homosexuals who try to assault Andy and Reds group, with who Andy starts to get along with pretty well, play a very important part in the story.After twenty years, a young boy who somehow knows and could testify Andy's innocence comes to Shawshank Prison for committing some felony. Warden gets him killed and covers up the crime with 'that boy trying to break free' story. By this time Andy gets ready for his revenge with Warden and his final step. Story unfolds.I would like everybody who watches this to watch this movie twice, so that they can understand the true essence of storytelling. Must tell you that, I was more thrilled when I watched it for second time, as I could understand things which were puzzling me for the first time. Brilliantly told, Meticulously Acted and Highly Recommended.",9,0,0,30 September 2009
