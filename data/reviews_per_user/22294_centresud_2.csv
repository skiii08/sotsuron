The King's Speech," Good entertainment, great acting from Colin Firth but overrated.
","Good entertainment, interesting story and great acting from the cast. This being said, this movie is certainly nowhere near a masterpiece. I didn't find the story gripping in any sense of the word. The relationship between the main characters is endearing but the storyline is sooo predictable. Please do see the movie. It's good clean family entertainment that appeals to a wide audience but in doing so it's not very challenging or innovative. Best Motion Picture of the Year, I think not, but considering that the competition included 'Black Swan, 'The social network' and 'Toy story 3' not surprising. Very competent and also very forgettable would sum up my rating.",7,1,2,6 September 2011
The Matrix," Good sci-fi movie
","I'm surprised by many of the extremely negative reviews of The Matrix. Rating this movie a 1, really? Almost seems like there's a cabal. I rate an 8, and minimum a very strong 7. I viewed it 20 years later with my 10-year-old son and his friend, and the FX certainly stands the test of time, since they were both impressed. Even with everything that's out there today.Obviously, if you hate sci-fi or tech, stay away from this movie. Unless you're a tween, you're not going find much philosophical enlightenment either. Having said that, at the time, it did create a standard for the genre and remains a entertaining movie.As for the story line, in 1999, we hadn't reached the ten-year mark of the popularization of the internet, so the themes certainly struck a chord. Still does today.Relax and enjoy.",8,1,1,12 December 2018
