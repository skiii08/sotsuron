Lucky Number Slevin," Trying to be too clever....
","I don't know about you, but i thought the writer must have watched a couple of Guy Richie/Tarantino films and thought i can do that.... But the big difference is, The quick witted, fast paced comments were cringe worthy compared to their quotes. i thought the film was OK and had bags of potential. Hartnett shined amongst an awesome cast. I'd probably say my 4 is a little harsh, and i don't regret watchin the film. But, i just think that the script made itself seem poor from trying to be too clever. Verdict - watch it because Lucy Liu is gorgeous.Kc",4,2,6,24 July 2006
