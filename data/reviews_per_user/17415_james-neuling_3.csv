The Ring," Does what it set out to achieve
","Great film.  It does exactly what it set out to achieve - scare the living hell out of you. If you want to sit around the house and be scare to go upstairs alone, and have your heart racing at every second sound, then this film does it for you. No gore, no tacky blood, just pure and simple scare. Relatively unknown actors also do their part to keep the film flowing, and the music score is what you would expect from a horror film. Great film for late night viewing, effect is doubled. And if you rent the DVD, bet you don't watch the 15min film !",10,0,1,7 March 2004
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Childish
","We spent years growing up with Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back.. and waited for the super finale. Then Spielberg releases this junk clearly aimed at an audience 8-12 yrs. Cute cuddly creatures beating up on trained soldiers??  Gimme a break.",4,16,30,28 May 2003
Man on the Moon," Boring
",The most boring film I have ever seen.  I watched it because of Carrey's ability to turn anything into fun.. I waited and waited.. it never came. Simply awful. Do everything you can to avoid this film.,1,11,24,28 May 2003
