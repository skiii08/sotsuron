War Dogs," A couple of gun runners get what they deserve
","The US military needs guns and ammo, dammit! Where does it all come from? Corrupt arms dealers, of course! Two Jewish guys decide they want a slice of this hot bullet time action, and hilarity ensues as they bungle their way from one deal to the next.It's all going well until they try to fill an order for 68 gazillion bullets, which requires an ill fated trip to the vile, backward hell hole of Albania, where the filthy Albanians have been stockpiling Cold War era 7.62mm ammo for the best part of a century. Suddenly everything goes to shit. Good times!Languages spoken: American, English, Albanian.I rate War Dogs at 26.64 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a hilarious 8/10 on IMDB.",8,1,3,4 July 2018
Gravity," Unashamedly heterophobic
","I expected to join this movie more than I did. And to some extent that was actually true: I did enjoy it more than I did. But in other ways I felt it could have been so much more, and if it had been, I would have enjoyed it as much as I'd expected to.The plot itself is very thin: we start with a disaster which segues into another disaster, which segues into another disaster... etc... until finally we run out of disasters and all of a sudden everything's OK. Which is a bit of a letdown to be honest.Nevertheless this was an excellent science fiction film, with the most realistic depiction of gravity-free space in the history of cinema. The interior of the Soyuz capsule was painstakingly accurate, perfectly reproduced right down to the last switch and button.But it's easy to get lost in the visuals and forget that they merely constitute a vehicle for the message.Gravity is replete with potent symbolism. I was impressed by its complex exploration of social identity, consciousness, environmental issues, economics, and human sexuality.The last of these was the most obvious; phallic imagery everywhere, except in the scenes with George Clooney (who stars in a role better suited to Ben Affleck). That was a massive clue, and once I picked it up I could see exactly what the director was saying.There are constant references to 2001: A Space Odyssey. This is more than just a homage; it's a complete remake of Kubrick's epic film. The mystical 'star birth' sequence is replicated with elegant sensitivity.As the men die off one by one (*cough*misandry*cough*) Bullock's character questions herself constantly. She has no idea what she's doing there, any more than we do. Her monologue is halting and reluctant, as if she's reciting lines she has rehearsed beforehand.Is she really a mother? Does she know what being a mother is? She seems to believe she has a daughter, yet we never see the daughter. What does the daughter represent? The obvious answer is 'lesbianism' (remember, all the men are dead! big hint!) but perhaps that's too obvious? As in real life, the tension of this existential dilemma is never quite resolved.Many critics have identified 'Gravity' as unashamedly heterophobic, and I can't deny that. As a heterosexual man I did find it very challenging. Yet I still felt it spoke to me as a film-goer, but more importantly as a human person. It was an enriching experience.I rate 'Gravity' at 26.64 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a solid 8/10 on IMDb.",8,3,6,27 March 2014
Fight Club," Existentialism and eroticism in a stylish package
","A brilliant existential thriller, in which Edward Norton's brutally masculine character dominates an effeminate Brad Pitt.Despite its heavy-handed homoeroticism the movie is a powerful celebration of contemporary heterosexual manhood.Trapped within his corporate prison, the protagonist slowly undergoes a shocking transformation into the ultimate Nietzschean Ãœbermensch and destroys society in a final act of triumphant nihilism.Meat Loaf makes a brief appearance as the bisexual Mormon who has lost his testicles to cancer (some extrapolation is required here).Helena Bonham Carter is also present in certain scenes.I rate 'Fight Club' at 26.64 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a solid 8/10 on IMDb.",8,0,1,2 April 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Pert and perky like home baked potatoes!
","After suffering the train wreck of the previous prequels, I expected Rogue Force One: A Star Wars Saga Story to be more of the same. Incredibly, it was not.This is the darkest Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back, and unlike the other prequels it didn't feel like a kiddy flick. I was pleasantly surprised, and even impressed.Standout performers: 'Mad' Mads Mikkelsen, Alan Tudyk, Orly Schuchmacher, David Sobolov, and that black guyThe use of CGI to recreate Grand Moff Tarkin and Princess Leia was absolutely jaw-dropping. I hope they do more of this in future.I rate Rogue Force One: A Star Wars Saga Story at 26.64 on the Haglee Scale, at which works out as a flirtatiously pert 8/10 on IMDb.",8,1,3,27 March 2017
Public Enemies," Gripping... violent... immoral... and that's just Marion Cotillard!
","In this disturbing post-feminist morality play about violent men and the women who love them, Johnny Depp stars as the troubled young man with a damaged relationship and an on-again/off-again moustache.Marion Cotillard shines as the cynical girlfriend with a fur fetish.Christian Bale (in a role better suited to Ben Affleck, who left the production citing 'unspecified concerns') delivers a brief cameo performance as misogynistic cop Melvin 'The Perv' Purvis, but struggles to convey the emotional nuances required by this deceptively simple role.Roger Ebert described 'Public Enemies' as a thrilling period drama with vivid social metatextuality. It is difficult to find fault with this analysis.I rate 'Public Enemies' at 23.31 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a solid 7/10 on IMDb.",Null,0,1,2 April 2014
Alexander," Stone should have left this sorry mess on the cutting room floor
","Oliver Stone's controversial and deeply flawed 'swords and sandals' epic.This clumsy 3.5-hour example of historical ignorance and directorial ineptitude is an insult to anyone who has actually studied the life of Alexander the Great.Contains good battle scenes (albeit inaccurate), some of the worst dialogue ever seen on the big screen, acting so wooden you could build a house from it, and a mixed bag of mediocre green screen work. The Macedonians all have Irish accents (?) except for Alexander's mother, who seems to be trying for some vague approximation of an obscure East European lilt (??), while the Persians don't even sound remotely Persian (???)When Alexander is not screwing his wife or an assortment of young men (Stone's Alexander is a heterophobic bisexual; the real Alexander was simply homosexual) he spends most of his time sulking or staring into space for no apparent reason.I rate Alexander: The Final Cut at 13.32 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a predictable 4/10 on IMDb.",4,2,4,10 June 2016
The Hateful Eight," Is that a letter from Abraham Lincoln in your pocket, or...
","Kurt J.J.M. Russell and that black guy (no, not Morgan Freeman, the other black guy) star in this torrid tale of lust, revenge, and a young man's dreams. Eight mildly unpleasant people find themselves sheltering from the winter storm in a claustrophobic cabin. As tensions between the travellers become unbearable, tempers flare and insensitive language is used. Kurt Russell calls the black guy a n****r. Then Jennifer Jason Leigh calls the black guy a n****r. Then Tim Roth calls the black guy a n****r. By the time we're halfway through the movie, even the black guy is calling himself a n****r (I wasn't sure if this was racist or not).Finally violence erupts and guns are drawn. Somebody gets shot in the testicles. Somebody else starts vomiting blood for no apparent reason. And so on, and so forth. Good times!I rate The Hateful Eight at 26.64 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a moderately bigoted 8/10 on IMDb.",8,1,5,18 August 2016
We Were Soldiers," A paint-by-numbers war movie
","Mel Gibson's buttock-challenging 138-minute Vietnam War marathon is a B-grade movie with all the usual Yank stereotypes, though it stops short of triumphalism.Surprisingly, Gibson (starring in a role better suited to Ben Affleck) sees fit to include a grudging nod to the heroism and brilliance of the Viet Cong, who successfully defended their homeland against the imperialist American invaders despite being outnumbered 2:1.The movie ends on a pessimistic note which foreshadows the humiliating defeat America would eventually suffer in 1975. I found this deeply satisfying.WWS is worth watching at least once, if you're into war movies. Alas, no role for Neville Gorman this time.I rate 'We Were Soldiers' at 16.65 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a solid 5/10 on IMDb.",5,2,5,27 March 2014
Justice League," Mediocre!
","Every time I am disappointed by a Marvel movie, I watch a DC movie to remind myself just how much worse it could have been. Justice League: Dawn of the League of Justice is a case in point. If you're looking for great scriptwriting and good quality CGI, you won't find it here. DC really is the bargain bin of superhero movies.Superman is dead, having succumbed to the fatal wounds he received from critical reviews of Batman Vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice. Wonder Woman is sad, because Superman used to be her boyfriend.Batman (the useless character nobody even wanted) is forced to admit-twice in this movie!-that he has no superpowers whatsoever, which completely discredits his ludicrous claim to be a superhero.MerMan is a raging alcoholic whose general attitude towards life can be summarised as 'Fuck the lot of you' (I really liked this guy!) The Dash is a moody autistic kid with ADHD.Victor Doom is now a black man (for some strange reason?!) and somewhere along the line he's traded in his hooded cape for a boring hoodie that looks like it was stolen from Walmart. His powers also seem to be very different from what I remember, but perhaps that's just me.Together they face Steppenwolf, who is arguably the most interesting and relatable character in the entire DC universe aside from Blackheart. (When are we going to get Steppenwolf Vs. MerMan? I'd watch the hell out of that!)Somewhere along the line, Steppenwolf has lost his three magical Rubik's Cubes, which will allow him to destroy the universe if he can just find the bloody things and stick them back together. Batman says this would be a very bad thing, and wants to stop Steppenwolf himself, but can't because he's not a real superhero. Wonder Woman is sad, because Batman used to be her boyfriend.Anyway, the various superheroes do their thing in predictable fashion, and for the most part it's an absolute cringefest.Batman wants to resurrect Superman using magic Krytponite goo and some other stuff that is never clearly explained. The Dash agrees to stop Steppenwolf as long as it doesn't involve fighting, saving people, or exerting himself in any way at all. Wonder Woman is sad, because that guy from the other movie used to be her boyfriend. Victor Doom is having some kind of existential crisis. MerMan literally has no fucks to give.A special mention goes to Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa, Jeremy Irons, and CiarÃ¡n Hinds, who all worked hard to salvage this hot mess from the dumpster fire it so richly deserves to die in. I thoroughly enjoyed their performances. Everyone else can bite a grenade.I rate Justice League: Dawn of the League of Justice at 16.65 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a paint-by-numbers 5/10 on IMDB.",6,0,2,22 July 2018
Aliens," James H. Cameron's Aliens: Special Edition
","It is rare for a sequel to eclipse the original, but that's what happened when Aliens hit theatres in 1986. Six years later, Cameron released James H. Cameron's Aliens: Special Edition, which he introduced as follows:'What you're about to watch is the special edition of Aliens. I actually prefer this version to the released version, because, as it's been best described by one of my friends, it's 40 miles of bad road. I think it's a longer, more intense and more suspenseful version of the film. The conventional wisdom then was: don't make the film too long. But at two hours and 37 minutes, this is the ride that we intended you to take. So, enjoy it.'The Special Edition of Aliens holds the unique distinction of being the only alternate edition in the Alien franchise considered canonical by 20th Century Fox. It also contains all the smoking scenes, where we discover that everyone is still using regular 20th century tobacco products in the year 2179.For example:* Ellen Ripley (cigarettes)
* Carter J. Burke (cigarettes)
* Members of the Weyland-Yutani Corporation review board (cigarettes)
* Gunnery Sergeant Al Apone (cigar)There is also a suggestion that Ripley's cat (Smokey Black) chews tobacco leaves; this is audible during one of the early scenes after Ripley leaves the Holodeck.While Cameron had very little creative control over Alien, the sequel was a very different matter. Here he was responsible not just for direction, but also the screenplay and story. Cameron's Xenomorph design remained true to the original Geiger-inspired vision from which later sequels would radically depart. For visual effects, he hired the brilliant Skotak brothers.Aliens was produced at the height of the so-called 'homosexual panic' of the 1980s, when it was feared that gay people would flood North America with their deviant ways, and eventually reduce heterosexuals to a persecuted minority. Cameron took note of this, and shaped his subtext accordingly.The Xenomorphs are predominantly male, and aggressively phallic. They represent an ideological and existential threat to the explicitly heterosexual colonists of Acheron LV-426. Their means of reproduction (oral rape) reflects a longstanding myth that homosexuality is contagious.The Acheron Queen is a symbol of the feminised masculinity that was widely believed to comprise an essential aspect of the homosexual psyche. It does not represent lesbianism, as many commentators have suggested.Ripley, Hicks, and Noot represent the traditional, all-American nuclear family, offering the best defence against homosexual invasion and conquest. By contrast, single males (e.g. Hudson) and masculinised females (e.g. Vasquez) are quickly overwhelmed.Despite being a Hispanic character, Vasquez was played by Jenette Goldstein, a freckled, pale-skinned Jew with blonde hair and blue eyes. This required Goldstein to perform in 'Latintoface' (brown contact lenses, and full face/body makeup) which was acceptable in the 80s, but considered 'problematic' today.It is noteworthy that most Hispanic and Latino people praise Goldstein's portrayal of Vasquez, while those who are outraged by it tend to be middle class whites of a certain ideological persuasion. At any rate, Goldstein received a Saturn award for Best Supporting Actress Pretending to be a Hispanic Person, and Vasquez is still one of the most popular characters of the entire Alien franchise. I personally rate her as equal with Ripley for sheer awesomeness.The dialogue in this movie is superb: gritty, sparse, and intense. The one-liners and comebacks are some of the best you'll ever seen in the popular and well established sci-fi/action/family adventure/thriller/socio-political/post-capitalist/drama genre. The tension and action ebb and flow in exactly the right way. The colour pallette is flatter than you'd expect, but this works surprisingly well.The visuals are highly evocative, and deliberately so. The M41A Pulse Rifle was inspired by elements of the M1A1 Thompson, Remington Model 870, and Franchi SPAS-12. The UD-4L Cheyenne Dropship was inspired by the the Apache AH-64 attack helicopter. The Kushan Assault Frigate of Homeworld and Homeworld Cataclysm was subsequently inspired by the U.S.S. Sulaco.I rate James H. Cameron's Aliens: Special Edition at 29.97 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a cracking 9/10 on IMDB.",9,0,6,16 March 2019
The Fast and the Furious," Shoddy remake of the 1955 classic
","Never watched any of these before so I thought I'd give it the old college try.Oh dear. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. This cinematic abortion looks like it was made in the mid-90s with a mid-80s cast, a mid-70s plot, and a mid- 60s colour palette. Unmitigated cretinosity. Contains many memorable lines, including:'This doesn't feel right.' 'Aaaaaah, my arm!' 'Yeah, it's funny how that works out.' 'I like the tuna here.' 'Let's go for a little ride.''He went to the car wash.'Move over Shakespeare, the pros have arrived! I rate The Fast and the Furious at 6.66 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a predictably dull 2/10 on IMDb.",2,2,6,10 June 2016
Captain America: Civil War," Quick, to the Starkmobile!
","It's Captain America versus Captain Business, as the Avengers tear each other apart while trying to figure out why the plot is so frustratingly aimless.As the Winter Soldier rears his ugly head again, Captain America is torn between old loyalties and an understandable desire to smack the **** out of Tony Stark. All your Marvel favourites are here: Micro Man, Psycho Girl, Archer Boy, Side Chick, Spank Machine, Inscrutable, the Flying Black, and Chadwick Boseman!With the Winter Soldier proving to be the weakest and least troublesome villain of all time (seriously, everyone in the entire movie gets a go at throwing him against the nearest wall—even the unaugmented humans with no superpowers) the Avengers must fight amongst themselves for two and a half hours in the hope of making their way to a post-credits scene.I rate Captain America: Civil War at 16.65 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a desultory 5/10 on IMDb.",5,9,18,4 August 2016
Get Out," A sensitive exploration of transracialism
","Written by Jordan Peele. Produced by Jordan Peele. Directed by Jordan Peele. Stars Daniel Kaluuya as Jordan Peele.What are we going to do about the negroes? Nobody's quite sure, but Jordan Peele--himself a former negro--presents an intriguing solution in this controversial thriller about a young black man struggling to find his place in a white transracial community.I rate Get Out at 23.31 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a mildly discomforting trans-7/10 on IMDb.",7,3,8,1 May 2017
The Mist," Another dunger from Steve King
","Laughably poor! It's based on a Steve King novella, so I wasn't expecting much, but even by this low standard it was full of epic fail.The plot (painfully predictable from scene to scene; you could spot the twists from miles away), the acting (more wooden than a Christmas sale at Bob's Wooden Wood Barn for Lovers of Wood during 'Wood Week'); the dialogue ('It appears we may have a problem of some magnitude'; 'Don't go out there! There's something in the mist!')... oh dear, it was all so horribly awful.Even a B movie would blush to be this bad.And I swear: if Toby Jones hadn't shot Marcia Gay Harden when he did (which was STILL at least an hour overdue) I was going to fly over to the States and do it myself! I rate 'The Mist' at 6.66 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as an appropriately humiliating 2/10 on IMDb.",2,0,3,2 April 2014
Hotel Mumbai," Feisty shenanigans at Hotel Mumbai!
","Everyone's hanging out at Hotel Mumbai, and it's all pretty cool until a bunch of filthy Pakistani terrorists attack! Staff and guests are slaughtered in their thousands as the rabid nutters sweep each floor, while the hopelessly outgunned local police stand outside like a bunch of second hand turnips.Most movies of this sort focus on the battle between terrorists and authorities, but Hotel Mumbai is all about the hostages and their desperate bid for survival. There's even some guy in a turban, which I thought was very exotic!Based on the 2008 Mumbai attacks, and with high production values made possible by a generous grant from Deutsche Telefunken, this controversial Indian/Australian collaboration punches well above its weight.Stars Kohli M'gohli, Dhoni M'ghoni, Shami M'ghami, and Sharma M'garma.I rate Hotel Mumbai at on 26.64 the Haglee Scale, which works out as a rampaging 8/10 on IMDB.",8,2,12,21 August 2019
Midsommar," Robin Hardy rolls in his grave
","The latest attempt at a 21st century incarnation of The Wicker Man. It fails spectacularly, because the last person who knew how to do what Robin Hardy did in 1973 was Robin Hardy, and nobody ever had the decency to ask him. Also, he died in 2016.Let's start with the good points: (a) cinematography; it's visually stunning, and Florence H. Pugh looks gorgeous; (b) music; it's bold, evocative, and atmosphericNow the bad points: everything else.There is no plot. Some people go to some place, some stuff happens, and then the movie ends. If you're looking for narrative, you won't find it here. Why? Because **** you, that's why.'Plot' holes, poor characterisation, and general inconsistencies are glossed over like the eighth layer of varnish on your grandmother's piano. Why? Because **** you, that's why.No attempt is made to develop a coherent belief system for the members of the Swedish cult. Why? Because **** you, that's why.The cultists' religion is never presented in any systematic way. Its rituals and traditions are entirely arbitrary, and seemingly unrelated to each other. Looks like the scriptwriter said 'Let's just make them do a lot of weird stuff. The weirder the better, so we don't need to explain it.'Why did they do this? Because the rituals don't need any significance. And why is that? Because they're just a vehicle for the violence, the sole purpose of which is to shock the audience. But the turgid predictability of the screenplay kills any latent tension, so there is no shock at all, and the violence is just boring.The critical failing of this movie is its lack of a clear protagonist. The original Wicker Man had a powerful plot driven by a strong protagonist, an even stronger antagonist, and the clash between their respective worldviews.By contrast, Midsommar has... nothing. While its main characters do experience increasing discomfort, their worldview is accommodating to a fault, and yields at the slightest push. As the crazy mounts up on all sides, they continue to rationalise it away in the name of political correctness. This robs Midsommar of an ideological collision; the very motif that worked so well in Hardy's film.Apparently Swedish cultists use jazz hands instead of clapping, because of course they do. Let's borrow one of the dumbest idea from American social justice warrior culture, and shove it into a movie based in northern Europe. Great stuff.I rate Midsommar at 13.32 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a shockingly flawed and highly derivative 4/10 on IMDB (2 points for cinematography, 1 for music, and 1 for Florence H. Pugh).",4,3,5,8 October 2019
Avatar," Blue space monkeys in pro-environmentalist shocker!
","'Avatar' is loud and colourful. You get plenty of noise for your money and your eyes will be overloaded by stimuli. Visually, it's gorgeous. Graphics are smooth and elegant.The 3D is a mixed bag; it seems to fade in and out. Scenes with real actors look best; scenes with a predominance of CGI vary in quality.This is not ground-breaking, history-making stuff. It's just vanilla 3D with chocolate sauce, in need of some more beta testing.The CGI tended to disassociate me from the Na'vi (the blue space monkeys who inhabit Pandora).While I enjoyed the switch between Jake's two 'worlds', the CGI stuff never felt real and the graphics used to create them seem a trifle cartoonish. Consequently, Avatar looks like it's been pasted together with screencaps from a sophisticated MMORPG. Sadly, the strongest characters are all heterosexual and enjoy freedom to choose their own destiny, while the gay and lesbian characters are consistently disempowered.The Na'vi are shamelessly characterised via the classic 'noble savage' stereotype, and consequently I couldn't give a toss about their fate.A mixture of Native Americans and African Americans (two peoples enslaved and abused by white Americans, ironically) they are so dumb and hippyish that I couldn't take them seriously.During the rare times when they're not babbling pseudo-mystical nonsense at the humans, they play 'cowboys and Indians' with each other and hang around looking moody.They have no idea how to mobilise themselves against the humans. It takes Jake (a 'Great White Chief from the Skies') to unite the clans and get them doing what they should have been doing since before the movie even started.Only Jake can do this because--having spent all of several weeks on Pandora--he has magically become a complete expert in every aspect of their language, culture, society, politics and history. And how? Because he's a white American. Yes it's 'Dances with Wolves' on an alien planet. Huzzah! Avatar is replete with heavy overtones of cultural imperialism and white supremacy. The movie bizarrely subverts itself by embracing these concepts for the sake of the increasingly ridiculous plot.There is nothing egalitarian or Na'vi-esque about Jake's rise to power amongst the Na'vi. He's just the biggest kid on the block with the biggest weapon and the smartest mouth.He's the Great White Chief from the Skies who has to lead the noble savages to glory because they're not smart enough to do it by themselves. He's able to bond with the Toruk despite the fact that he's not even a real Na'vi and has only been on the planet a few weeks.Jake civilises the Na'vi by introducing human constructs to their society and empowers them by providing human technology. He is a Lawrence of Arabia for blue space monkeys. After all the 'nasty humans hurting lovely natives' business, the Na'vi ultimately find salvation in the very race which attacks them. Subtext: white men rule, OK? Jake accomplishes a 'once in a lifetime' feat which only five of the clan's greatest Na'vi have ever achieved in the entire history of Pandora. He then leads his new people to war, having become more of a noble savage than the noble savages themselves.Which we knew he was going to do because the movie blatantly telegraphed it at least an hour beforehand. As it did with all of the plot's crude developments.Movies based on stereotypical plot elements and stereotypical characters are horribly predictable because everyone already knows what to expect from the stereotypes.Avatar slavishly adheres to this tired old formula which is why the story just isn't very interesting. It wastes new technology on old cheese.Some have suggested Jake is successful because he has a different outlook to the Na'vi (e.g. more pragmatic and ruthless), and inside information about the humans' plans. But is this correct?The Na'vi are already pragmatic and ruthless. They're not all sitting around in communes smoking weed. They attack humans on sight (not to mention each other), hence the need for the Avatars. The only 'different outlook' that Jake has is the one he steadily loses throughout the course of the movie!Is Jake's 'inside information' a deal-breaker? Nope.The humans already know where the Na'vi clan are living (Sigourney Weaver's character has been running a school there, remember?) Sigourney Weaver's character also knows the humans are straining at the leash and might attack at any moment; she could have told them this herself.From the moment the first bulldozer tries to roll over Jake, it is obvious to everyone that the humans are heading for the tree.So what exactly did Jake tell people that they didn't already know or couldn't have figured out for themselves? Nothing that I can see. It's just weak scriptwriting.Some characterisation is quite good. The Muslim scientist guy is a case in point. Sigourney Weaver plays the lesbian doctor convincingly. But it's not enough to rescue this stinker.I've barely touched on the plot holes. Examples could be multiplied. There were also some dizzying leaps of logic.I was checking my watch at the 90 minute mark, yawning after 2 hours and wishing I could grow a third buttock for extra coccyx support by the time we entered the final 20 minutes.That's when I wasn't laughing loudly at the atrocious acting and cringe-worthy dialogue.In fact there were quite a lot of laughs in the cinema, and when the movie finally ended everyone just sort of shrugged and walked out. Like me, they were simply glad it was over.I rate 'Avatar' at 16.65 on the Haglee Scale, which works out at a solid 5/10 on IMDb.",5,1,3,2 April 2014
Sicario," The movie Norman Chipotle wished he had made
","Set in Mexico but filmed in Nicaragua because of the Muslims, this gritty tale in the popular and well established CIA/FBI/gangland thriller genre brings us face to face with the kingpin of the infamous Mexican paellas and their deadly drug trade.Inspired by the 1995 Spanish hit of the same name, Denis Villeneuve joins forces with Basil Iwank to deliver a stunning cinematic spectacle augmented by the musical genius of Jóhann H. Jóhannssonson. This is a bilingual movie, but subtitles are provided when Mexican is spoken.Keep your eyes peeled for a neat little cameo by Raoul 'Sol' Trujillo!I rate Sicario at 31.65 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a breathtaking 9.5/10 on IMDb.",9,0,3,26 May 2016
Joker," A well crafted piece of cinematic genius
","Heath Ledger set the benchmark for Joker movies in 2008, and in the 11 years which have passed, nobody's come within a long country mile of his performance.Until now.I am not a fan of the DC universe, and I tend to find DC movies pretty laughable. But this dark origin story for the Joker is easily one of the best films I've seen in years.Joaquin Phoenix is utterly convincing. If he doesn't get some kind of award out of this, I'll be frankly astounded. His performance is absolutely consistent from the first frame to the last.We are shown the real Joker as he was originally intended to be, before Hollywood's lazy depictions warped him into a cheap imitation of the comic book villain.Most important of all, we finally learn the Joker's true origins.Batman's dad is a complete *******, just like Batman will grow up to be. He had an affair with the cleaning lady, which resulted in the birth of the Joker. This means the Joker is Batman's older half brother, which explains the animosity between them.The cleaning lady is fired, and forced to sign a confidentiality agreement. She lives in poverty with the Joker, who knows nothing of his connection to Batman.The Joker eventually finds out and is understandably aggrieved. He visits Batman, but doesn't get a chance to explain their relationship.The Joker becomes disillusioned with society. He does some stand up comedy, and manages to get a spot on the Murray Macklemire show, where he takes his revenge on societyBatman's parents are murdered by a bunch of clowns because screw rich people.I went into this movie with low expectations, and they were blown right out of the water.Supervillain films usually follow the 'bullets and explosions' formula, but this is nothing like that. It's a well crafted piece of cinematic genius that delivers the most authentic portrayal of the Joker ever produced for the big screen, and (at long last!) the canonical story of his twisted origins.To me, the ultimate significance of Joker is twofold: it's the first movie to rehabilitate the Joker as a sympathetic anti-hero with an official backstory, and it's the first movie to establish Batman as a canonical character within DC's Dark Extended JokerverseI rate Joker at 29.97 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a stunning 9/10 on IMDB.",9,2,7,20 December 2019
Downfall," A tribute to the Russian saviours of Europe
","Words can barely describe the power of this film. I have a strong constitution for depictions of violence and emotional trauma, but 'Der Untergang' was utterly harrowing in its intensity.There was a certain scene involving Magda Goebbels which made me want to leave the room and hug my baby daughter. Those of you who have already seen the film will know what I'm referring to.I am in total awe of Ganz. His depiction of Hitler is utterly believable. I have read that he spent four months studying Hitler's mannerisms and accent in order to achieve perfection in the role. This is true professionalism.When the Russians finally arrived they looked and sounded incredibly 'foreign' to me (more so than they would normally, if that makes sense) and I struggled to understand why.I finally realised it was because I had spent so much time immersed in the world of the Germans that I had begun to identify with them. Consequently, I found myself viewing the Russians through 'German' eyes.I don't know if anyone else had this experience, but it struck me as a testament to the brilliance of the cast, their acting, and the superb combination of direction and cinematography.I rate 'Der Untergang' at 29.97 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as an appropriately Teutonic 9/10 on IMDb.",9,0,3,26 March 2014
Kong: Skull Island," A wasted opportunity to make a decent R-rated Kong film
","I watched this movie for what it is; I judged it according to its genre. It was still terrible.2005 Kong was better. Yes it was corny, yes it was silly, but it knew what it was, and it didn't pretend to be anything else. That's why it worked. Pacific Rim was big, and dumb, and proud of it. That's one of the reasons it was so enjoyable.Problems with Kong: Skull Island:Generic script; generic, stereotypical characters; poor casting; poor editing; poor pacing; tonal inconsistencies; lacklustre acting by actors who clearly don't give a crap; death by numbers; inconsistent and totally unbelievable behaviour from characters; seismic detonators that explode like giant fire bombs for no good reason; journalist takes photos with the same lens throughout the entire movie (long distance shots, close shots, shots that would require zoom or telephoto; doesn't matter, she gets them all with the same tiny 35mm lens!); helicopters continue to fly close to Kong for no apparent reason, even though they've already seen him smack several choppers out of the sky; bloodless wounds and deaths, no matter how violent; laws of physics casually ignored whenever they're too inconvenient for the plot; plot elements introduced and abandoned arbitrarily; inconsistencies of scale.I could go on and on.The 1970s setting was pointless, and added nothing to the movie; it was just an excuse to drag in some unnecessary Apocalypse Now references.I went into this movie expecting to love it. I was sorely disillusioned. John C. Reilly is the only person who emerged from the wreckage with his dignity intact, and that's only because he played a character that was tailor made for his shtick.I rate Kong: Skull Island at 16.65 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a pedestrian 5/10 on IMDb.",5,0,1,26 June 2017
Prometheus," Astounding revelations at every turn!
","Good points: Prometheus is the best Ridley Scott movie since 'Barry Lyndon', which was not a Ridley Scott movie but should have been. The plot was seamlessly woven into the fabric of the other Alien films (particularly the first one but you could see echoes of the other three as well); this was a very nice touch.Utterly gripping; how could we have guessed what was coming next? Astounding revelations at every turn! Patrick Wilson totally carried the first half of this film; I am so pleased to see him getting solid roles again. Cliffhanger ending: will Shaw reach the Engineers' planet and save Earth from destruction? Not necessarily! Duration was ideal; anything less than 2 hours would have been a waste. Superb characterisation; no need to guess motives or rationale. Plot was logical, believable, and easy to follow.Bad points: Too many aliens. OK, I understand that they're on an alien planet in a facility created by aliens who probably created other aliens, but why so many aliens? I just don't understand the focus on aliens.Michael F. Assbender didn't look like an android; this was very unrealistic and spoiled the character for me. Far too much was explained; I wanted mystery and unanswered questions! Kate Dickie was miscast in a role clearly written for Aitana Sánchez-Gijón. Visuals were poor.Overall, a big thumbs up. I'm looking forward to the sequel.I rate 'Prometheus' at 26.64 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a magnificent 8/10 on IMDb.",8,1,9,27 March 2014
Taken 2," This zany advertisement for Mercedes Benz taxis will delight and inform viewers of all ages
","An American family struggles to survive on the mean streets of Istanbul!This deeply xenophobic 'thriller' fails to match the high standards set by its prequel but ticks all the right boxes for the ignorant USA-based audience at which it is obviously aimed.Those of us who have actually visited Istanbul will know the city was unfairly and inaccurately portrayed as some kind of Egyptian slum rather than the majestic, culturally and historically rich capital it actually is.Taken II was heavily sponsored by Mercedes Benz, hence the prevalence of MB taxis throughout. Again, those of us who have actually visited Istanbul are fully aware that the yellow taxis there are predominantly Fiats.Liam Neeson stars in a role better suited to Ben Affleck, who was forced to withdraw from the production citing 'creative differences' and 'scheduling conflicts.'Critics are sharply divided over the director's use of filters. The music score is dramatic but otherwise unremarkable. Tracking shots were very good.I rate 'Taken II' at 16.65 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a solid 5/10 on IMDb.",5,0,0,26 March 2014
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," How about killing Ben Affleck? That would be the dawn of justice!
","What a disappointment this movie turned out to be. I watched it after seeing X-Men Apocalypse, which was indescribably awful in every possible way, so my expectations were reasonably low.Credit where it's due: the opening scenes were very powerful, and quickly established that the quality of Batman Vs Superman was going to be far ahead of Apocalypse. But by the time the first act was over I could tell it would be downhill all the way, and sure enough that's what happened.Superman is now even more of an emo than Batman. Batman is still unable to overcome his fear of guns, and still refuses to kill people. He's also stuck with some kind of weird unresolved mummy issues.Batman needs to wear a mask and speak in a silly voice to disguise his identity. Superman only needs to put on a pair of glasses that do absolutely nothing to disguise his identity but somehow make him completely unrecognisable.Lex Luthor is now a giggling halfwit (I must be one of the very few people who thought Jesse Eisenberg actually made this work) yet still capable of running a vast high tech multinational corporation.Wonder Woman is supposed to be a super-strong Amazonian warrior, but she's built like a stick insect with the body mass of a flea. She doesn't bother to disguise her identity at all, because nobody cares.Batman wants to kill Superman because he's jealous and Gotham lost the football game against Metropolis.Doomsday is indestructible, unstoppable, and more powerful than Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman put together. Despite this they manage to kill him because something something the power of friendship.The only person who emerges from this dire performance with any shred of dignity intact is the magnificent Jeremy Irons, whose Alfred is far more credible and relatable than the grovelling cockney 'cheers-guv'nor-'av-a- good-'un-at-Wayne-Manor-tonight-you-won't-'ear-a dicky-bird-out-outta-me- if-you-bring-a-bit-o'-fluff-'ome-at-3am' cretin played by Michael Caine.I watched the ultimate edition in the hope I would get more than I bargained for. Alas, it was not to be.I rate Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of Justice at 13.32 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as an insipid 4/10 on IMDb.",4,2,11,3 July 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," George Lucas is a sellout and J.J.M. Abrams is a cinematically illiterate toss monkey
","As far as I can tell, the planning stage for Force Awakens went something like this:Lucas: 'So, do you have any original ideas to spice up the next episode?' Abrams: 'None whatsoever. Not a single thing. I don't see the point really, we could trot out any old ******** and they'll still buy it.' Lucas: 'Well that worked for me in the last three films.' Abrams: 'Hahaha!' Lucas: 'How about recycling 90% of the plot from IV, with a few scenes from VI?' Abrams: 'Brilliant! I'll do it!'The movie starts well, but quickly descends into a mess of clichés. With the exception of Daisy Whatever, everyone looked like they were just phoning it in. Chewbacca gave the impression that he would happily sell his own backside to get off the cast, but unfortunately he had to stay until the bitter end.Emo Ren is the weakest, least convincing villain I have seen in cinema for many years. He has no personality whatsoever, and we know virtually nothing about him. Equally useless is his mentor, the evil Severus Snoke.This movie is essentially a rewrite of the original Star Wars, and they even admit this when somebody points out that the new megaweapon is just another Death Star ('No it's not!', says somebody else, 'Because this one is bigger!') And yes, the new totally-not-a-Death-Star has the same old weakness that everyone knows about, which is easily accessible because no attempt has been made to protect it. And the rebels—who were previously cursing the Empire for blowing up planets—praise themselves after blowing up a planet.The token black guy was so irrelevant he might as well have been an extra. The stormtroopers followed their well established tradition of shooting in every direction except where the heroes are, with all the military skill of a cross-eyed donkey with four wooden legs. Meanwhile, the heroes are equipped with auto-aiming weapons that guarantee one shot, one kill.Blah blah blah, stuff happens, who gives a toss. Oh, and something something Luke.I rate Star Wars: The Force Awakens at 9.99 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a humiliating 3/10 on IMDb.",3,37,44,21 June 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Bigger, badder, and madder than ever!
","I went and saw this with Mrs Sankari last Thursday. We bought tickets for the 18:45 showing, and I expected the place to be packed. It wasn't. There were probably 12 people in the entire theatre (including ourselves) so we scored perfect seats.Two people walked out after the first half hour. I still have no idea why.MMFR has rather idiotically been described as a feminist movie, and so-called 'Men's Rights Activists' have reacted to this with the well practised impotent rage for which their tribe is notorious.Needless to say, the whole thing is a manufactroversy. Just off the top of my head:* the prevailing culture is unequivocally partiarchal * the only known matriarchal tribe is on the verge of extinction, with less than half a dozen members left * nearly all of the fighting is done by the men * when the women fight the men they are invariably overpowered * Furiosa spends most of her time driving, while Max spends most of his time fighting so that she can stay alive long enough to keep driving * five of the main female cast members are helpless sex slaves * the remaining members of Furiosa's tribe don't even have names (or did I miss them?they were interchangeable characters anyway) * all of the women end up being rescued by men * by the end of the movie, men are still in charge of everythingIf that's a feminist movie, I'm Natalie Portman.So anyway... this is one huge knockout blockbuster; a hell of a ride with all kinds of crazy shizzle. Miller's direction is superb. Within the first 10 minutes he uses broad strokes to paint a complete picture of his post-apocalyptic world, and by the 15 minute mark you're fully immersed.Everything feels real and utterly believable. The deliberate use of practical FX (including fully driveable vehicles) places this film in the upper echelons of cinema, leaving CGI-heavy wannabes like Avatar in the dust. The main characters were extremely well drawn, and properly fleshed out. My personal favourites were Max and Nux, with the latter particularly impressive due to his development throughout the film.I could go on and on, there is just so much to describe and appreciate. It is hands down the best film I have seen in years and I will definitely be seeing it again.I rate Mad Max: Fury Road at 29.97 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a jaw-dropping 9/10 on IMDb. I got so much more than I bargained for, I had to share some with my wife.",9,5,17,10 June 2015

13 Hours," The secret story of Obama's heroes!
","Michael Bay is famous for his superbly accurate war films, and this documentary style retelling of the Benghazi siege will go down in history as the finest work he ever produced.The story is as follows...US Ambassador Chris Stevens was sent to Libya, which is where the Muslims come from. He did whatever ambassadors do, and apparently did it well. Concerns were raised about poor security at the consulate and the nearby CIA outpost due to years of neglect under George Bush. Barack Obama's repeated attempts to improve defences at both sites were constantly blocked in the Senate by hostile Republicans, who claimed it was a waste of money at a time when the USA should be completely withdrawing from Libya.In the second week of September 2012, CIA agents noticed that the Muslims were even more angry and unpleasant than usual for that time of year. The head of the CIA compound was in a chronic state of denial, refusing to believe what his eyes and ears were clearly telling him.Minutes before the consulate came under attack, its security detail—a bunch of poorly trained Muslims with a random assortment of firearms—fled into the night like bitches on heat. Moments later, the consulate was crawling with Muslims. There were hundreds, possibly thousands of them. Some say millions. Muslims always move in large numbers.The consulate contacted the CIA compound for help. A crack team of CIA guys (known today as 'Obama's Heroes') volunteered to rescue Stevens and his bodyguards, but the CIA chief refused to let them go. (In the film he repeatedly orders them to 'stand down' on his own authority. Eventually he contacts the White House to inform POTUS, by which time the consulate is on fire).The White House tried everything they could to send help, but their strongest forces were too far away to reach the scene in time, and the cowardly CIA chief refused to deploy his own men.The Muslims tore the consulate apart in a furious search for the Americans, screaming and chattering in that language they speak, which sounds like a donkey fellating a camel. Chris Stevens took shelter in a safe room with his bodyguards, but they were eventually smoked out by the Muslims. Stumbling through smoke filled rooms, Stevens was separated from the others and later died in hospital from smoke inhalation. His bodyguards were massacred by the Muslims.Under intense pressure from Obama and Clinton, the CIA chief finally agreed to let his super-troops attack the Muslims. Sadly they arrived too late to save their fellow Americans, but they did manage to escape with a bunch of old typewriters and other secret consulate stuff, which they successfully saved from the Muslims.The CIA troops battled their way back to the CIA compound, fighting off hordes of screaming Muslims in every street. The Muslims switched their attention from the consulate to the compound and hit it with every kind of Muslim weapon imaginable (e.g. AK47s, RPGs, mortars, etc.) The CIA troops fought back, killing many Muslims. This went on for 13 hours (hence the title of the film).By dawn the compound was littered with bullet cases, dirt, debris, and the corpses of Muslims. Some Americans had died as well. Humiliated, the few remaining Muslims ran away.Another bunch of Muslims arrived; but these were good ones, imported from Tripoli. They had been trained to defend Americans, and successfully rescued the survivors at the CIA compound. Everyone went home, including the rogue CIA chief who had issued the 'stand down' order in defiance of his government.It was a good film. I learned a lot about the Muslims.I rate 13 Hours at 26.64 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a magnificent 8/10 on IMDb.",8,0,7,6 June 2016
Princess Mononoke," A Miyazaki classic
","This haunting tale of two young hearts trapped in a world gone mad will linger long after you've turned off the TV.The art style is classic Ghibli: fluid movement, realistic proportions, a strong moral component and the traditional clash between noble protagonists and immoral antagonists.That said, it's also pretty dark. Mononoke Hime revels in scenes of wanton violence, involving severed limbs, decapitated heads, copious amounts of blood, and that old Japanese favourite, the orifice-probing tentacle. Perhaps the boldest aspect of the story is its lack of a clear victory for the hero. Resolution is achieved, but it comes at a terrible cost. The most powerful character—a nature god—is presented as benevolent, yet seems almost indifferent to the plight of the forest creatures that worship him. His goals are clear, but his methods are harsh. He shows no interest in evening the score between oppressor and oppressed; he simply seeks to restore the balance, without any regard for the price that others will pay. There is no sense of fairness here. The deer god is an wild spirit; an animist's god from the ancient times. He does not issue judgement; he simply does what needs to be done. 'Justice' is a luxury for the gods of theists.I rate Mononoke Hime at 29.97, which works out as an orifice-probing 9/10 on IMDb.",9,1,1,15 July 2017
The Martian," Matt, you're not making this easy
","This tedious family adventure film is the latest contribution to the popular and well established 'Where Are We Rescuing Matt H. Damon From This Week?' genre.I like Matt H. Damon, I really do. But he's been making it very difficult recently, and this 2+ hour marathon just doesn't help.Damon plays an astronaut accidentally marooned on Mars by a storm that literally could not happen because Mars lacks the necessary atmospheric conditions, where he must somehow survive with nothing but an unlimited supply of electricity, an unlimited supply of water, an entirely self- sufficient artificial habitat, half a dozen spare space suits, multiple land vehicles and probes (all in perfect working order), food supplies intended for half a dozen people, and a large quantity of magical potato seedlings that grow to maturity in just a few days despite a complete absence of soil nutrients.Since the first act establishes that Damon is so well set up he doesn't actually need rescuing, Ridley Scott fabricates a second act 'emergency' in a vain attempt to raise tension (it doesn't).Damon keeps in contact with Earth via a magical transmission technology that provides full HD streaming with no latency whatsoever, allowing him to have real time conversations with NASA headquarters, where everyone does and says whatever they want because there is no chain of command even though it's ostensibly run by Jeff Daniels (played by Jeff Daniels).His fellow astronauts remain hovering above Mars, beaming their own HD stream to NASA by the use of a magical camera that automatically homes in on Damon regardless of where he is on the planet.NASA builds a brand new rocket from scratch in less than 14 days so they can send Damon a fresh load of unlimited supplies. It explodes immediately after takeoff because Ridley Scott still has another hour to fill. Meanwhile Damon accidentally blows up his potatoes.NASA's lone Chinese employee suddenly remembers that his uncle has a private rocket he's never got around to using, so they phone China and ask if NASA can borrow it. The uncle agrees so the Chinese government sends it into space immediately, where it is instead caught by Damon's astronaut colleagues, who nick all the supplies.Meanwhile Damon is travelling to the other side of the planet, where he intends to escape using a previously unsuspected bonus rocket that just happens to be lying around the place in perfect working order. Damon can't carry his unlimited supply of water and only has enough room in his vehicle for a few sandwiches, but by a remarkable stroke of luck it turns out that his body is capable of indefinite peak physical performance despite minimal hydration and a complete lack of nutrition, so that's OK. Also it turns out that the gravity on Mars is exactly the same as Earth's, so he hasn't lost any muscle tone.Damon arrives at the bonus rocket and is told by NASA that it's actually too heavy to lift off the planet despite being designed for that exact purpose (???) The only solution is to remove the nose of the rocket, which is actually easier than it sounds because the entire spacecraft is made of Lego and can be easily disassembled by a single undernourished man with no tools.With the nose of the rocket removed, Damon risks being killed by the extreme physical pressure generated by takeoff. NASA points out that a simple tarpaulin is strong enough to protect him, so he finds a spare one from... somewhere... and straps it on.Damon's fellow astronauts pair their ship with his rocket using Bluetooth, and take over the controls. Damon is almost crushed to a pulp as the rocket leaves Mars, because it turns out that tarpaulin isn't as strong as industrial steel after all.Somebody on the astronauts' ship blows something up because of reasons, and this somehow makes it easier for one of them to rescue Damon, who has jumped out of his rocket and is now flying towards their ship with the aid of a hole in the finger of his space suit and an unlimited supply of pressurised oxygen.NASA is helpfully streaming this heroic rescue to the entire planet using their magical realtime HD stream, because of course they are.Damon and his fellow astronauts arrive home safely just a few hours later, and Damon is rewarded with a free pair of glasses. Henceforth, everyone must call him 'Doctor.' Because doctors have glasses.I rate The Martian at 13.32 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a mediocre 4/10 on IMDb.",4,102,186,10 November 2015
Furious 7," A surprisingly effective reboot of the original franchise
","So I finally got around to watching this, and I actually got more than I bargained for. F7 reboots the franchise and fixes the chronology, which now looks like this: The Fast & The Furious, Tokyo Drift, Furious 7.All continuity errors are now solved, and the remaining films are no longer canonical.F7 was notable for its broad audience appeal. Box office figures showed that it was the first film in the trilogy to be enjoyed equally by gays, blacks, Muslims, and normal people. Vin Diesel attributed this success to the richness of its cross-cultural references and the broad diversity of its cast (heterosexual whites, heterosexual blacks, more heterosexual whites, and some other heterosexual whites).I personally found F7 to be the most rewarding and realistic of Vin Diesel's F movies.I rate Furious 7 at 16.65 on the Haglee Scale, which workes out as a generous 5/10 on IMDb.",5,1,18,10 June 2016
