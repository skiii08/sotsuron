Come and See," Review
","This movie was very sad to me. It really brought out the true colors of the Nazis during WWII. I felt that most war re-enactments are too scared too show the gruesomeness that this movie showed with ease. The main character shows a true character arc. He is timid in the beginning. He is naive and scared, but after witnessing with his own eyes the destruction and death that has been brought over his people. He becomes obsessed with the fact that he feels revenge is the only way to get even against the Germans.Not to mention he looks like he aged about 30 -40 years through out the movie. Over all this movie is not for the faint of heart but if a person is looking for a movie that clearly depicts the horrors of WWII, this is the movie for them.",Null,1,1,12 December 2010
