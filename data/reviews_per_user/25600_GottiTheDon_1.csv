Scarface," Great Gangster Movie
","Pacino was perfect for the role of Tony Montana for director Brian DePalma's look at a Cuban immigrant who comes to America for a slice of the American dream, only to find drugs and money are what make you big. DePalma tells the whole truth about the drug game. Nothing lasts forever, and no drug lord retires with a house on the hill. Ever since New Jack City portrayed this movie as an inspiration for drug dealer Nino Brown, Scarface has become a symbol of what makes a great gangster movie.",10,0,1,2 November 2002
