The Avengers," i am very impressed.
","This was an excellent superhero movie. I personally don't believe that the 'rumored' justice league movie of 2013, starring superman, batman, the flash, wonder woman and green lantern, will have an easy time living up to this film. The special effects were great and the 3d was very impressive. I think the hulk was an amazingly animated character and defiantly stole the show with his comedy, action and overall awesomeness. This film is defiantly worth the watch, especially in 3d. I so hope that there will be a sequel, with many more heroes joining the avengers, such as ant-man, black panther, the fantastic 4, spider-man or wolverine.",10,3,8,4 May 2012
The Hunger Games," hmmm.... poor adaption.
","I found the Hunger Games to be a great movie, but i am not impressed with the adaption from the book! the book was defiantly the better of the two!! The movie has missed out a lot, such as peeta's fake leg, the origin of the mocking bird pin changed, the spear not being removed from rue... changed. It also used a slightly blurred clip for the bloodbath at the beginning of the actual games, so it didn't give you the intensity like the book did!! If you haven't read the book or seen the film yet, then read the book first! if you have seen the movie then read the book and find out for yourself how it is such a poor adaption!! i hope that for Catching Fire and Mocking jay, the adaption is a lot better!!",7,2,5,4 May 2012
