Howl's Moving Castle," An overrated work
","In this film, director Hayao Miyazaki overly focused on the design of the romantic plot. In addition, the expression of the anti-war theme is not entirely based on the script, and it is somewhat self-talking.
Therefore, although the movie is full of various visual wonders, due to the relatively immature handling of drama conflicts, all this lacks a platform that can truly release emotions. In the end, this story full of narrative ambition and various complex metaphors ended up in a random private reconciliation of several major characters. Compared with Miyazaki's best work, what the film lacks is really deep thinking and brave expression.",6,1,5,6 June 2018
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Very Entertaining
","Steven Spielberg shows his historical view undisguisedly in the film, which makes the film look like a satirical Nazi comedy.
Some of the famous shots and some types of settings are certainly worth writing into history, and the action parts and comedy details perfectly guarantee the narrative's getting better and better. However, the use of paranormal endings actually undermines the shaping of heroic images and legends.",7,0,1,1 July 2018
Coffee and Cigarettes," Jim Jarmusch's Poetry and Philosophy
","Although it appears to be a simple collection of short stories, it is actually well considered and designed by the director. Like the rest of his work, Jim Jarmusch's thoughts come from the trivial of everyday life. The seemingly unrelated chapters slowly but effectively make up the emotional of the film, culminating in a wise and memorable ending. The meaninglessness of communication and the human self - camouflage are expressed correctly and wonderfully in the film.
At last, the world ended in stains of coffee and ash of cigarette, however, Jim jarmusch seemed to need only a one-and-a-half minute nap.",8,0,0,23 April 2018
Deadpool 2," Although it is a cliché, it is basically done properly
","The script is barely fluent, but the first half is too sluggish. Of course, this practice of letting jokes go beyond the script may also be the intention of director and screenwriter. Although it is not conducive to the integrity of the film, it does attract some audience.
In terms of the construction of the world view, the film is not as sluggish as the Avengers, but it is also rougher (and perhaps a stylized choice), and basically only takes care of a specific audience. This is also a common problem of all kinds of mainstream superhero movies.",6,1,3,27 July 2018
Ready Player One," Another Truism of Spielberg
","Although it has the incomparable implementation effect on visual effect, this film is still a typical truism of director Steven Spielberg.
The overwhelming visual spectacle filters all the drama elements that can create a deeper conflict, while keeping the audience's attention locked in an imposing mixture of popular culture.
As the story goes to the end, in order to build a traditional happy ending, a plain preaching killed all the possibility that could leads a further discussion.",7,0,2,1 April 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Is realism just an excuse?
","Maintaining the smoothness of entertainment and the integrity of the theme has always been what Spike Lee is good at, so the film's comedy tone is actually expected.
Therefore, the basic texture of the film is very similar to a more entertaining 'Malcolm X', of course, the latter focused on the individual, and the film focuses on the group.
One problem that needs to be pointed out is that the end of film can give the audience an instinctive emotional sublimation, but as a functional part of the film, the end seems to be slightly redundant. Or is this also a part of ridicule?",7,0,5,24 October 2018
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Too much is as bad as too little
","It can be seen that the director and the screenwriter are not satisfied with simply completing a fairy tale, but the world view is too limited.
The film was stuffed with too many dramatic elements, but the arrangement between the main line and the secondary line did not constitute a uniform style, nor did it have enough persuasive logic support.
The over-functionalized emotional flow rendering attempts to use 'coincidence' to compensate for the constraints of this play, but in fact has little effect. From this perspective, the setting of 'Fantastic beasts and where to find them' is both gimmick and cumbersome.",6,0,0,13 November 2018
Gone with the Wind," Hollywood's peak
","After the elegant ruins were buried, what was left behind was a touch of innocence, a unique collection of American culture.
The powerful expression of visual language makes many of the slightly rough plots in the original work more convincing, so every time the story is about to become cliché, there will be an appropriate reversal.
Therefore, the cunning of being a craftsman and the sincerity of being a poet seem to have reached a near perfect resonance in this film.",9,4,6,12 November 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," An Opportunistic Fraud
","Given that Marvel studio has already abandoned the effort to build a world view in the any sequel film. Therefore, before that meaningless random massacre came, the film basically guaranteed an effective rhythm of storytelling to the fans.
However, after the construction of the story has been established, it is not appropriate to try to create a sense of tragedy with mechanical superposition.
It is not so much a breakthrough; it is more like an opportunistic fraud.",7,0,5,14 May 2018
Annihilation," Beautiful and Cruel
","The film reveals a transformation from sense of technology to sense of rite. However, Alex Garland, the director of the film, used a sly ending to keep the script from deviating from the traditional genre film too far.
Therefore, whether the expression of instinct self-destructive tendencies of human being, or the discussions of meaningless biogenesis, are both abandoned after an uncertain doubt.
As for the filming technical level, from cinematography to OST, and the performance of Natalie Portman, all this parts are quite brilliant. In addition, the mixture of cruel plot and holy atmosphere is unique and unforgettable.",8,26,53,12 March 2018
Jackie Brown," An Atypical Tarantino Film
","This film is basically a traditional love story.
Except for the reference of the popular music element, Tarantino's personal style is not obvious. 
And as for the completeness of the film itself, due to some branches of the story are not telling advisably and smoothly, therefore, the length of the film is too long, and its rhythm is somewhat sluggish. 
If the film can be simplify some, completely give up those unnecessary dialogue with Tarantino's personal style that looks like imposed by himself, made it into a 120 - minute film, it will turn into a better entertaining story.",7,0,3,11 March 2018
The Nice Guys," Unexpected Great
","Unexpected Great
The script is designed smoothly and very entertaining. Director Shane Black perfectly restored the cultural atmosphere of the late 1970s.Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling offer a surprising and outstanding comedy performance.
In this film, reflection of realism and the style of romanticism do not contradict each other; therefore, the movie finds universal resonance in an indifferent attitude. That is also the reason why whimsical origins of the story and the crazy details of the details are natural and appropriate.",8,0,1,11 April 2018
