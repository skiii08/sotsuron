Iron Man 3," Least favorite of the 3
","Definitely my least favorite of the 3.While I love the slapstick humor of Tony Stark, they went overboard trying to make this more a comedy rather than a quality action movie. Would really like to have seen more fights with Tony in the suit, rather than just controlling it remotely.Also very disappointed with the Mandarin. What should have been the best villain by far was a total flop.Suits were also a let down....not nearly as stunning visually as past movies.Overall: Is it worth the $10? Yes, but a let down compared to the first 2.",4,6,12,3 May 2013
