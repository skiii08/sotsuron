The New World," Extraordinary picture!!
","Quite possibly, the most beautiful film I've ever seen. Certainly, there's never been anything like it. I would suggest familiarizing oneself with the story of Jamestown, Capt. John Smith, and Pocahontas to appreciate the film all the more. Terrence Malick (Harvard Rhodes Scholar, Professor of Philosophy at MIT, etc.) naturally assumes the story is already well known. Anyone who might have missed that day in school will probably miss a lot in the movie and assume it's somehow incomplete in it's exposition. Assuming the audience already knows the true story allows the director to go in a different direction with the film. An incredible experience! I was moved beyond words and expect numerous Academy Award nominations for this one.",10,11,24,23 December 2005
