Iron Man 3," Awesome
","This film is the best Iron Man film because it's unpredictable, it's funnier than the others, and Ben Kingsley is in it. He plays the 'villain' in the film but is hilarious, giving an excellent performance. Robert Downey Jnr is, as usual, the quick-witted, sarcastic Iron Man but this film focuses on his weaknesses: his relationship with Pepper is declining as he's spending more and more time in his work; his house is not as safe as you would imagine the country's hero to be; and old ghosts return from the past.This is a great film with a lot of laughs and explosive action, definitely a film the Iron Man fans won't be disappointed with.",9,0,4,11 May 2013
