Vertigo," Hitchcock's VERTIGO: My all-time favorite movie and a simply one of the best movies ever made.
","Rating: **** out of 4. Scottie: 'I hope we will, too.' Madeleine: 'What?' Scottie: 'Meet again sometime.' Madeleine: 'We have.' Many films in his career have proved his title as 'The Master of Suspense', but VERTIGO reveals a different side of the Master, digging deeper into his darkest obsessions and revealing them with a kind of perverse beauty. No wonder this movie wasn't so well-received back then! At the time, some critics were still classifying Hitchcock as just another filmmaker, not quite yet the artist we consider him to be (Though he already has gained the affection and interest of French critics who were taking film criticism into new heights at the time). Time was certainly kinder to Hitch, and time came that he would be considered one of the most artistic filmmakers of all time, and VERTIGO was finally seen as the true masterpiece that it is. 'Did he train you? Did he rehearse you? Did he tell you exactly what to do, what to say? ' - ScottieThis movie is not just another suspense thriller from Hitchcock (another factor as to why people didn't quite embrace it at the time); this is an even darker dream-like melodrama that reveals some of the Master's own dark obsessions. The more you know about what happened behind the scenes in VERTIGO, the more the movie will make sense to you. Originally, Hitch wanted Vera Miles to star in the film, but due to pregnancy she had to decline. This disappointed Hitch, so he had to pick a different actress for the role. This led Hitch to pick Kim Novak for the role. After the film did poorly in the box-office and was heavily criticized, Hitch partly blamed Novak for delivering a bland performance; clearly Hitch wanted to bring out something from Novak that he felt Miles already had in her. Obviously, he was modeling both Novak and Miles to his most preferred blonde muse: Grace Kelly. The parallels to Hitchcock and Miles/Novak and Scottie and Madeline/Judy are undeniable. 'The gentleman certainly knows what he wants!', says a saleslady in the film, and same can be said to Hitch and the way he tries to bring out that certain performance he wants to his latest in a long-line of icy blonde characters. It's perverse and chillingly interesting. 'Anyone could become obsessed with the past with a background like that!' - Scottie(Warning! This summary may contain a few SPOILERS) After a dizzying, nightmarish opening sequence, backed-up by Bernard Herrmann's most haunting and memorable score (alongside his TAXI DRIVER, another great score that takes us right into the heart of its main character), we are plunged into the dream-like world of San Francisco, this time at night, where an unknown man runs for his life from rooftop to rooftop, pursued by a cop and a detective; the detective is John 'Scottie' Ferguson, played by James Stewart in a performance that wipes him of his Capra-esque nice-guy image. While pursuing the unknown man, Scottie slips down a rooftop and dangles for dear life. When he looks down the ground below, he starts getting dizzy and the height itself seemed higher. The cop goes back and tries to save him but he himself slips and falls. What an inconvenient time to discover you have Acrophobia. After the fatal accident, Scottie decides that he quit detective work as he feels compelled to blame himself for the accident. 'It wasn't your fault.', convinces his close friend/ex-fianc√©e Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes); this early scene in Midge's apartment will be just some of the few moments of touchy-feel Hitchcock humor as the film descends into somber tragedy as it goes along. Scottie is then recruited by an old college mate named Gavin Elster (Tom Hellmore) to trail his wife Madeline (Novak) who may have either gone insane or possessed by a dead ancestor. Scottie agrees to follow the wife around a maze-like San Francisco, where Madeline makes several stops to buy flowers, then to visit the cemetery, then visit a small motel, then the museum at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor, then finally a Golden Gate Park, where she stands perfectly near the crashing waves... and jumps to her death. Luckily, Scottie jumps in just in time to rescue her. At this moment, Scottie will find himself looking for a love that he may never find. After a failed second attempt to save Madeline, Scottie finds another woman named Judy (also Novak) to assume the role of Madeline, obsessively dressing her up with the same clothes and dyeing her hair with the same frozen blonde hair. The movie starts out as one thing and takes a twisted turn and becomes something else, but this is all part of what Hitch had planned all along. He never really wanted to do another suspense movie with something as personal as VERTIGO. This is an even more powerful story with a deeply compelling look at obsession as only a true artist can do. Jimmy Stewart's performance is so deeply tragic and twisted that it may just rank as one of his best. There's also no need for Novak to apologize with her performance, which captures both the mystery shrouding Madeline and the tragedy of Judy trying to want a man to love her by assuming the identity of another. This is one of the most tragic tales of unrequited love ever made, and a truly powerful motion picture that's perfect in almost every way (cinematogrpahy, music, EVERYTHING). A true triumph meant for multiple viewings.",Null,1,6,18 February 2011
Black Swan," Perfection
","Every time I see a film I absolutely love, it's hard for me to put into writing my show of affection. Oh sure, I could apply the usual words like 'masterpiece' or 'pure cinema' like I always do, but the more I get the opportunity to see movies like BLACK SWAN, it's pretty hard for me to apply all the usual praises ad naseum. You just got to talk about the unique visual style, the direction, the superb acting, the poetic imagery, the music, and everything else. BLACK SWAN is that kind of film; a film that I'm truly wild about. This is definitely one of the best of the year.Darren Aronofsky has never been the formula guys; he's one of those directors that are always there to surprise us and restore our faith in a cinematic world where spoon-fed formula is always the order of the day. Films like PI, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, THE WRESTLER, and even the underrated THE FOUNTAIN are works of an artist to watch, and with BLACK SWAN, he has proved once again that he's a true filmmaker. After a more conventional but still outstanding work with THE WRESTLER, Aronofsky returns to the surreal style of his earlier films in this dark, beautiful, grotesque, and absolutely amazing work. Like what it said in some of the reviews, it's THE RED SHOES meets Polanski's REPULSION, with elements comparable to the works of Cronenberg, De Palma, Hitchcock, and even animator Satoshi Kon (whose 1998 anime PERFECT BLUE is numerously referenced here), but the film is still purely Aronosky's, with his trademark visual style and camera angles, as well as the resurfacing of themes in his earlier works; like the characters in REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, Nina (Natalie Portman) slowly loses her grip with reality and her dreams as she becomes obsessed with 'perfection' and slowly descends into madness. Like one of the best thrillers, Aronofsky understands the importance of visual clues; a manner of showing rather than telling (The endless use of mirrors, for example, imply a dual personality). Aronofsky also gives the film a more natural feel like his previous THE WRESTLER, which means it requires natural performances, and the actors deliver.Natalie Portman deserves all the praises she got portraying Nina, a goody-two-shoes ballet dancer who gets the lead part of the White Swan in their company's audacious reimagining of Tchiakovsky's Swan Lake. But to be able to truly nail the role, she must also play the character's mysterious and looser alter-ego, The Black Swan. Mila Kunis plays Lily, Nina's understudy who may or may not be driving her crazy so that she could get the role. Vincent Cassell is terrific as the commanding artistic director Thomas Leroy, who tempts his young performers so that he can get the performance and grace he wants from them. Credits should also be given to bit role performances by Barbara Hershey as Nina's domineering mother who watches anxiously as her daughter lives the dream she left behind, and Winona Ryder as Nina's predecessor and professional ballet dancer Beth, distraught by getting replaced.And as usual, I've applied all the usual praises to a film I know I loved WAY more. I just simply can't do justice to this superb masterpiece. It's just, well, perfect. The beautiful choreography of the ballet sequences (backed up by Clint Mansell's brilliant recapturing of Tchiakovsky's original compositions) are gorgeous to behold, as well as mysterious and dream-like. The movie also has the feel of a waking nightmare where the lines between what's real and what's a hallucination have been blurred out; we feel Nina's slow descent into madness as we see things as she sees them.Is BLACK SWAN the best of the year? A bit of a stretch, but it's still unlike any movie I've seen all year.",10,1,4,27 January 2011
Iron Man 2," Pretty good the second time around.
","Rating: *** out of 4.If the first IRON MAN was the origin story, than naturally its sequel would throw in the consequences. That doesn't make it a better film; in fact it's too much of it actually. But with the right balance of humor, thrills, special effects gimmicks, and more of Robert Downey Jr. as the narcissistic Stark, IRON MAN 2 is an adequate follow-up, even if it goes wildly out of control as it makes like SPIDER-MAN 3 and throws in as many subplots than it can handle.But unlike the latter, director Jon Favreau and writer Justin Theroux (TROPIC THUNDER) keeps things better in balance and some of the sub-stories don't come quite as pointless as the one's in SPIDER-MAN 3. Still, if your gonna put Mickey Rourke as a cool bad guy named Ivan Vanko, you might as well give him better use than a filler for the grand finale. Vanko is the son of a disgraced Russian physicist who once collaborated with Tony Stark's father. Now, Vank demands revenge to lift his father's legacy. But the movie seems more interested in Stark's own problems with his life as mankind savior. A US senator (played hilariously by Garry Shandling) argues that Stark should hand over his technology to the US Military. Stark declines, taking him one step further to competitor Justin Hammer, who has tried endlessly to apply his own technological breakthroughs akin to Stark's and failing miserably. He now recruited Vanko, who failed in his first attempt to assassinate Stark, to build him a new breakthrough that would rival Stark and shame him in his own 'Stark Expo' - Stark's annual unfoldment of his latest inventions. This gives more time for Rourke to play Ivan, not as a kick-ass bad guy, but as a comic relief spending time conversing with his pet Cockatoo. There's yet more plot: Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) gets a promotion as new CEO of Stark Industries, she gets a new assistant named Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson) who's really more than who she is. Plus Stark is being considered to be a part of the Avengers Initiative by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson, who extends his after-credit cameo in the first as a full-time role), and Stark's buddy Lt. Col. 'Rhodey' Rhodes (now played by Don Cheadle) gets his hands on one Stark's earlier Iron Man suit that gets a few modifications. Did I miss anything? Is IRON MAN 2 a crowded movie? Yes. It's not only over-plotted, it's cast reads like a who's who of who would people want to see in the latest Hollywood blockbuster (You want Scarlett Johannson in a tight rubber suit kicking butt? You got it!). But hey! In the heat of summer time, boredom can easily be cured by some explosive blockbuster fun, and IRON MAN 2 works fine. It's not as great as the first (which I never thought of as great as others think), and too much of it is a bid distracting (Stark is still front-and-center, but sometimes they tend to put him aside, then bring him back, and set him aside again), but it's a certified fun movie on a boring day.",Null,2,2,23 December 2010
The Others," Effectively bone-chilling, but there's more to it than that.
","Rating: **** out of 4.Sadly, there are fewer and fewer movies horror stories like THE OTHERS being made nowadays. Ask even some horror movie fans and they might pick SAW or Friday THE 13TH over THE INNOCENTS or DON'T LOOK NOW any day, and to an even lesser extent, some of the horror fans of my generation prefer the PG-13 junk to any of those classic 70's horror thrillers. Well, it's a good think that once in a while, great horror movies like THE OTHERS come out and bring us back to horror movie heaven where we truly belong.THE OTHERS is one of the better horror movies to have come out in years. I can't believe I have only seen it recently! Consider this one of the movies in my 'Should have seen it earlier' list. Director Alejandro Amenabar takes us on a psychological horror mind trip rather than the latest disposable PG-13-level release. It's scary but not in ways you expect. There are an occasional number of 'boo' moments, but Amenabar handles them better than most; taking full advantage of our expectations and than catching us when we least expect. The whole theme of the story too is far more mature than most films of the genre. Perhaps it ain't as thought-provoking as, say, THE INNOCENTS (a film THE OTHERS takes a few notes from), but it's brilliant in its own clever, mind-blowing way.Having only recently landing a role in MOULIN ROUGE as a playful, sumptuous Can-Can dancer, Nicole Kidman takes an opposite turn playing a dark, fragile character as Grace, a woman who lives alone with her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), in an old dark mansion while her husband Charles (Christopher Eccleston) is away at war. Grace hires a trio of helpers - housekeeper Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), a mute named Lydia (Elaine Cassidy), and gardener Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes) - to attend to the house. Then strange occurrences start happening, prompting Grace to believe that the house is haunted by 'intruders'. Anne starts seeing a boy she calls 'Victor', as well as an old woman she believes is a witch. Plus something may or may not be all right with the new help.THE OTHERS returns to the classic horrific atmosphere of those old-school horror movies - the candelabra-lit walks through dark hallways, doors being slammed shut by other things than the wind, and specters that look even creepier without the use of gruesome make-up effects. Even without the use of a lot of 'jump-out-and-scare-you' moments (though there are a couple here), Amenabar keeps us interested because, unlike recent throwaway fare, he has an excellent story and an interesting array of tragic, unstable characters, and an atmosphere than effectively (literally) keep us in the dark throughout the movie.Amenabar has not made an outright horror outing since (he did make TESIS prior to THE OTHERS, but nothing else after), which is sad. The genre needs more like him these days, one that can perfect the balance of good writing, performances, atmosphere, and scares and delivering a ideal entry in the much under-utilized genre.",9,2,4,12 March 2011
Salt," Outrageous but entertaining.
","My Rating: *** out of 4.Ridiculous. Implausible. Derivative. Way over-the-top. I'd be surprised if it wasn't! No one really goes to a movie like SALT expecting it would be moving or intelligent. They expect a good time, and in just the right time to beat the heat. SALT is a gloriously goofy but ridiculously enjoyable thriller. Not a great comic thriller like a James Bond movie or a serious chase thriller like any of the Bourne pictures, but it's fun all the same even if, with all the silliness that ensues, it could have at least had characters that would have cracked a smile just a little bit.Still, what it lacks in humorous and charismatic characters worthy of a James Bond, it more than makes up for it with the panache it gives to its action sequences. We've seen enough chases in action movies to last us a lifetime, and there's more than enough of those here in SALT. Not so much is added that it might as well establish itself as a remake/re-imagining of any other chase thriller or Cold War espionage plot ever made (which I think is what this movie really is). But to be fair, director Philip Noyce (a long-time action director) and writer Kurt Wimmer had me the moment Angelina Jolie suspects herself as a Russian spy and, tedious flashback sequences aside, never really lost me. Like so many other movies of its ilk, the plot is mostly a clothes-hanger which strings together a series of running scenes. And boy does Angelina run! And just to be dynamic, she jumps in a lot of things too, be it on the back of a passing truck (or three trucks) or an elevator shaft, Jolie's ankles must be aching with all the jumping she has to do in this movie.The plot is a belated Cold-War paranoia where CIA agent Evelyn Salt (Jolie) is suspected by a defector as a commie, raised in Russia (along with other children) to be sent to America as a mole. A-huh. Yes, the plot is preposterous (but to be fair, it might appeal to any conspiracy buff who felt that they might have missed out on this one), but I'll be honest I was with it all the way, even if I was only holding my laughter a couple of times. The action sequences, whilst predictable and nonsensical at times, are exhilarating, and at 100 minutes it doesn't let up. Sacrificing any dramatic depth in the process, the movie just keeps on moving. It ain't art, and not at all different from a dozen action adventure movies I've seen in a long time, but it does play its part as a summer movie: It gives you all the requisite bells and whistles without having to insult you in the process.",Null,3,6,31 July 2010
The Exorcist," Still one of the best horror movies ever.
","Rating: **** out of 4.THE EXORCIST is still one of the best horror movies ever made, not because it's still 'The Scariest Movie Ever' made as its now famous tagline suggests, but because it expresses the horror not present in most genre efforts today. Horror nowadays is misinterpreted as mere shock and scares, but some of the best horror movies out there are really about far greater horrors: The horrors of life, be it guilt, grief, or the simple study of fear.Despite the film's success, its director William Friedkin felt that the movie was misunderstood because he didn't really intend the movie to be an outright horror outing. He wanted to make a movie about faith; about the belief not just in God and The Devil but in what good and evil really is. Today, more open-minded moviegoers will look at the film as much more than a scare show or as a movie that turned pea soup into the most disgusting and horrifying special effect ever. Many will audiences will focus more on the story of its lead characters than its roller-coaster ride of gruesome special effects (although that was one of the reasons why the movie was memorable). The story of Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn, in an exceptional performance) in trying to restore her faith when her daughter Regan (Linda Blair, in the role that made her a star) goes out of the ordinary in her behaviour. Doctors throw in their theories of mental illness while a priest named Damien Karras (Jason Miller) believes that the Devil is within her.This is an even more intriguing film about the battle between good and evil and about faith in both than it is an outright horror movie. The performances are terrific, especially by Max von Sydow who only appears briefly on screen but is able to show his importance to the story. The creepy voice provided by Mercedes McCambridge (which was probably the one that got the Oscar's attention, but in the end actress Linda Blair got the nomination for her 'physical' performance of Regan) is memorable. Even some the film's shock effects have more potent power than the usual shock-for-shock-sakes moments in most recent horror movies. Now THIS is how horror movies are done.",Null,2,3,29 December 2010
Avatar," Not 'The Best Movie Ever', but one of the great movie-going experiences.
","It's the holiday season again, and I just got the 3-disc 'Extended Edition' of James Cameron's AVATAR as a Christmas present. I've just read that the set holds three versions of the film, the other two just adding certain scenes for the sake of the fans. You might call me a fan of the film (although I don't think it's worth building a religion on, ala STAR WARS), so this is a great DVD loaded with special features (more than the standard version) and it also includes the 'extended' and 'unreleased' version of the film that may not really be something you can't miss if you've already seen AVATAR or have it on the standard DVD already, but at least it makes my stay in Pandora just a little longer.AVATAR has its flaws, definitely. Even in its scale, there are certain elements that might still bother me, even after the nth time I've seen the film. But in the end, in spite of its occasionally cheesy dialogue and simple story, AVATAR is best judged as a whole movie-going experience. I loved it when I saw it on the big screen on 3D, but it grew on me even more the 2nd or 3rd or 4th time I saw it on DVD. It's like we are all avatars in a world James Cameron has created. It's a gorgeous experience; a new leap in movie-making technology built around the service of what is basically an old-fashioned storytelling. I'd choose the term 'old-fashioned' over 'trite' when describing AVATAR. The oft criticism that the story resembles those of DANCES WITH WOLVES and FERNGULLY don't come nearly as condescending to me. I love that the movie builds its entirely new world in the basis of an old-fashioned adventure story. Cameron take what makes these stories work (the characters we care about, the epic spectacle we crave) and throw them in with the latest in technological advancements.It may have just been a case of an unrestrained ego that Cameron called his AVATAR a 'game-changer' or 'new wave in filmmaking', but it's certainly a new way we can look at movies. The 3D technology here is not just another throwaway gimmick with a few scenes that pop out of the screen at our expense; Cameron uses it to serve the story. The impressive 3D used in AVATAR immerses us into the experience, right down to the beauty of the fictional Pandora universe to the very heart of the battle near the end. It's amazing how far the technology for making movies has come (but judging from the current and crappy use of 3D again nowadays, some lesser filmmaker have yet to use it wisely). The dynamo technology used for AVATAR may just be in the service of a big-budget Hollywood blockbuster, but in time (hopefully) other directors will use the technology to make something that would change movie-making for the better (no more of this 'shaky cam' nonsense please!).I have lived in a generation where shaky and headache-inducing movies like TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN get passed as entertainment, so it's fun to see a technically-impressive and yet old-fashioned and entertaining blockbuster like AVATAR, which restores my faith in what Hollywood blockbusters can do when they're done right.",10,2,5,29 December 2010
Drag Me to Hell," Drag me to horror movie-heaven.
","Rating: ***1/2 out of 4.Critics, audiences, and horror movie buffs are already torn between the consensus of Sam Raimi's return-to-horror-roots effort DRAG ME TO HELL; some critics declared it an instant cult classic while others, some horror movie buffs included, were skeptical. Me, I just thought DRAG ME TO HELL was the most fun I ever had in a horror movie in a long time. Is it a new classic? Only time will tell, but saying DRAG ME TO HELL is more fun than a bucket-load (or maybe even a shipload) of PG-13 horror remakes would be a dead give-away.At first, I too was very skeptical as to what makes Raimi's latest horror offering worth of high-praise. This not the first time since his EVIL DEAD trilogy that he touched a horror movie since he served as a producer to some crappy PG-13 horror remakes like THE MESSENGERS and THE GRUDGE 2; that's not really a good sign. But this is his first since in the genre both as a director and writer (along with brother Ivan), and finally mys distinctions of Raimi as a bit rusty has been proved wrong. In fact, seeing DRAG ME TO HELL kind of improved my affection for Raimi himself. I liked his earlier SPIDER-MAN pictures, but didn't hold any particularly high affection to them. Now that I've seen DRAG ME TO HELL (after missing out on it in the big-screen), I may have a higher appreciation for Raimi's style in his preferred genre and the manic energy in his earlier films. The EVIL DEAD series were gory, violent, but at the same time twisted funny and maniacally entertaining. DMTH throws us back to that era where Raimi's infant terrible sensibilities are at a high point.Alison Lohmann plays Christine Brown, a loan officer who longs for the position of an assistant manager position. She gives it her all, but her play-nice sensibilities puts him behind his scheming, butt-kissing competition Stu Rubin (Reggie Lee). It doesn't help when her unlikely position doesn't make an impression on the parents of her boyfriend Clay (Justin Long). Christine gets her chance to prove herself a tough decision maker when a old lady named Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) begs for an extension to her loan. Christine makes the decision to decline, making a good impression to her boss Jim Jacks (David Paymer, in an amusing straight-faced performance). But something's not right with the old Ganush crone, and after assaulting her in her car, Christine is cursed by the old woman to be sent to hell by demons within a few days.Like his earlier works, DRAG ME TO HELL pushes every jump scare and gross-out horror to over-the-top heights, serving it up with shock and equal amounts of sadistic humor, but playing it all with a straight-face (Don't worry about laughing during the scenes meant to be scary or solemn, Raimi and co. are laughing along with you). Like The Looney Tunes before him and Peter Jackson and Robert Rodriguez after, Raimi orchestrates his slapstick horror mayhem like a shameless prankster that he is, and there's also I kind of randomness to them; even at its most solemn, Raimi playfully throws in a scare or to unexpectedly. The special effects themselves look relatively low-tech but insanely playful, like the crazy Deadites of his earlier projects. Christopher Young's Elfman-esque score is loud and over-caffeinated, clearly playing those infamous jump-scare tactics of horror movies for laughs. The film may be PG-13, but pushes the envelope to the extremes with it; this is definitely the most fun PG-13 horror movie to date! Think Tourneur's NIGHT OF THE DEMON and THE EXORCIST played out as a Three-Stooges comedy and you got a clear picture of DRAG ME TO HELL.Lohmann is fun to watch (especially when she goes all tough when the spirits pushed her around too far), and a great sport considering the amount of disgusting, twisted hijinks she had to endure. Justin Long is hilarious playing what seems to be a needless role as the boyfriend, always standing around and 'believing in her', but doing very little to actually save her. Dileep Rao is even funnier in a straight-faced performance as the psychic determined to help Christine, but is either useless at providing procedures or conveniently giving them when it's almost too late. Adriana Barraza pops up near the end as the medium hell-bent (pardon the pun) to bring down the demon which she faced before many years ago. And then there's the goat...Not everyone will succumb to Raimi's stomach-turning craziness and the film is already getting some heavy backlash. but go ahead and just go see DRAG ME TO HELL for yourself. If you, like me, thought the movie is just the usual serving of perfunctory PG-13 horror, you might be surprised after a second look on DVD, and maybe bring a few friends over to have someone jump off your seats and laugh along with you.",Null,0,1,18 February 2011
Mission: Impossible," An intelligent action movie; not the best but fun.
","Rating: ***1/2 out of 4.Brian De Palma's MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE gets such a bad rap from both critics and fans of the series of its injustice to the source and for how the story is such a complicated mess. Even the cast of the original TV series had a bone to pick with De Palma's revision of the classic. If so, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE is best viewed not as the TV series revival but as a stand-alone movie, which it actually is pretty good.While MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE is far from De Palma's best works, and it is pretty mainstream from the usually independent director, but it does boast some of his signature styles. The split screens may be gone, but the use of long takes and Hitchcockian suspense sequences (the classic CIA vault break-in is something Hitchcock would have loved to see), as well as his love for Hitchcockian elements as double-crosses, espionage, plot twists, suspicious train rides, and seeing things that are not what they seem (actually, the last one was more De Palma than Hitchcock). In the end, while it is a Hollywood product, it's still very much De Palma.Now, stepping away from my obvious affection for De Palma's style, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE is quite a good action movie, even an uncommonly intelligent one. In fact, most of the action occurs momentarily and doesn't consume the storyline as it is often in Hollywood action movies. The film's terrific set-piece, a helicopter chase and a fight on top of a speeding train rolled into one, is saved for last. The plot takes full center in this one, which is about a an operation gone horribly wrong leaving IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) framed for the death of his teammates. The rest that follows will either be confusing to write down or would reveal some of the surprises that the story holds.The cast is quite great, but their not given all that much to do given that the movie is basically plot-driven. There's no romance in this one either which gives the film a 'no mushy business' directness but a lack of any human dimension, which is why the film's midsection is quite dull (until we reach the film's now-famous CIA break-in scene). And of Still, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE is great fun.",Null,0,0,29 December 2010
Rio," Nothing new, but look at that breathtaking scenery. Wow!
","Rating: *** out of 4. I usually don't like movies like RIO, mainly because they always end up being rehashes of previous movies; unless your talking Pixar, there's very little to no new things in animated movies nowadays other than their exquisite looks. So when I saw a special advanced screening of RIO a few days ago, my expectations were low, enough for me to expect that the film will fail. But hey, what a surprise! It's pretty good actually. So RIO ain't a new masterpiece-it's not at all much different with any Dreamworks or Blue Sky Animation effort that comes out every given year- but it was fun. The kids at the screening had a ball with it, but I can also hear older teenagers and adult audiences chuckling along with them. And I'm up there with them. The story isn't something you haven't heard before. Blu (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg) is a rare Blue Macaw raised in Minnesota by the bookish Linda (voiced by Leslie Mann). But being the last male of his species, Blu is requested to leave his Minnesota homeland and shipped to his real birthplace, in Rio de Janeiro, where a female of the same species is being kept in captivity. Blu doesn't warm up easily to the impetuous Jewel (voiced by Anne Hathaway), and certainly a rare bird such as her being kept in captivity like that doesn't help. It also doesn't help that Jewel wants to escape and Blu, being a total 'housebird' and all, can't fly. But what it lacks in a fresh new idea it more than makes up for in lively execution. This movie is just amazing to look at, boasting one of the most gorgeous looks of any animated movie since some of the Pixar films and the occasionally bizarre but lavish-looking BEE MOVIE. It may even be more beautiful since this is exactly what it wants to be and not much else. Director Carlos Saldanha, who helmed two ICE AGE sequels, and the rest of the crew have done just that. The eye-popping visuals are the moneymaker and one of the few films to come out once and a while that is worth paying extra money to see on 3D. Once again, the 3D ain't something groundbreaking, but it's exactly what comes to mind when thinking of 3D; the visuals are pristine and dynamic, with flying scenes that are just breathtaking to watch. I could almost feel the wind as a glider glides past the Christ the Redeemer statue. Rio itself looks gorgeous, from the 'Carnival' parades to the look of it during the nighttime scenes are just beautiful. If nothing else, it's a virtual tour of a beautiful portrait painted by Saldanha and his animators. The voice cast ain't bad either. Eisenberg is hilarious, and granted he'll be doing these kind of work sometime soon. The real standout is Jemaine Clement (from FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS), who lends an irresistible bad guy charm as a cockatoo named Nigel. Hathaway, George Lopez, will.I.am and Jamie Foxx all fulfill their roles perfectly. RIO ain't much new, but at least I enjoyed it for what it is. And I wouldn't mind going back to it during its official release and wallow in the dazzling scenery again. Here's a movie meant to be done (and seen) on 3D.",Null,17,28,8 April 2011
Titanic," Well, what can I say?
","Rating: **** out of 4.Well, here you go. Once the no. 1 box office champion of all time (beaten just recently by AVATAR, which was also directed by TITANIC director James Cameron) and a forerunner as the most popular movie of all time, there's really no way to sink this TITANIC from the popularity and relevance it has on modern pop culture. Did it deserve all the praise or was it an overrated piece of fluff? Doesn't matter what anyone says about it now. Like it or hate it, there's no putting it down now.But even with the multitude of backlash it got, TITANIC is still a great movie. Sure, it has its flaws (just as Cameron's new AVATAR has flaws). But counting them down would be irrelevant to the overall beauty of the film. Its sweeping wonder, spectacular scale, and unforgettable storytelling that pulled audiences in and it still does. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, the stars of the picture that eventually became household names during the film's release, got more serious with their careers and got more significant roles, and they owe just as much to TITANIC. Their performances as the star-crossed lovers Jack and Rose are believable enough to make us believe that they had something special. Many who diss on Cameron not being able to write a love story may have their points (there are some cheesy dialogue here and there), but you got to hand it to him; he knows how to establish chemistry between the two.TITANIC could have been done using the standard disaster movie format (multiple characters, silly subplots), but the addition of the romance adds that old-fashioned Hollywood feel to it reminiscent of those classic romances from the Golden Age of Hollywood. The supporting cast, including Frances Fisher, a spunky Kathy Bates, the wonderful Gloria Stuart, and others, are terrific. But the final touches to TITANIC is the titular vessel itself. Using the latest in special effects technology, Cameron is able to bring back the Titanic from its watery grave. Every detail is expertly crafted and further enhancing the experience of being in the Titanic.In spite of its very few flaws, TITANIC is an absolutely timeless epic.",Null,1,4,27 December 2010
The Fountain," You just have to see it again!
","Rating: **** out of 4.Darren Aronofsky's THE FOUNTAIN was such a disappointment on his part that, eventually, it's bound to inspire a few defenders who think differently from the not-too-impressed critics and audiences. You can include me there! I just saw THE FOUNTAIN a few days a go and thought it was great; a movie that may demand multiple viewings for it to sink through and you can count on it, I will see it again! One of the things Aronofsky wanted for THE FOUNTAIN, like its own main character, was for it to remain timeless. People might look at THE FOUNTAIN today and find it confusing, difficult, and rather odd, but art is sometimes like that. A work of art is not evaluated immediately; a true work of art stands the test of time and I think THE FOUNTAIN could prove itself to be a future classic. Right now, it's an immensely underrated but lovingly defended film for a more thoughtful and patient audience. It's certainly bigger, in scale and budget, that Aronofsky's earlier efforts, but it packs the same punch and is bound to find more audiences in the future as those films had.The story unfolds in three separate time frames. Dr. Tom Creo (Hugh Jackman) is a scientist desperately finding a cure for the tumor that's slowly killing his wife Izzi (Rachel Weisz), but too much time working sets him apart from his already dying spouse. Rewind a thousand or so years, and an almost similar tale unfolds with a conquistador (also played by Jackman) searching for the Tree of Life in a hidden Mayan temple for his Queen (also Weisz). Meanwhile, in the far future, a space traveler (Jackman--with a bald head) protects the Tree of Life concealed inside a space bubble, taking it to the Xibalba Nebula where, it is said, stars go to be reborn. So it's part historical epic, part sci-fi, and all love story, or at least a story about love and a quest to save it that spans across time.Jackman and Weisz may not be the most compelling couple ever, but they make their characters work and we believe that there is love between these two. Ellen Burstyn provides some excellent support (this is her 2nd time working with Aronofsky, after REQUIEM FOR A DREAM). Clint Mansell's score is alluring, mysterious and at time simply beautiful. The stunning cinematography and the use of lighting all play a significant part in telling the story, something that's best saved for more discussions to come.So if you haven't seen it yet, give this underrated masterpiece a shot. Never mind the critics on this one and judge it for yourself. You might be surprised at what you get here.",10,1,2,27 January 2011
August Rush," I'm no cynic, but...
","Now don't look at my like I'm someone who doesn't enjoy a heart-warming fairy tale! I thought AUGUST RUSH had the potential to be really good. The story was interesting, the movie looked decent, and the soundtrack was good. But wow! So much potential was lost in translation. The story follows the Dickensean adventures of a young boy named Evan (Freddie Highmore). He's an orphan, but like most orphans in movies he knows that his parents are still alive. He's also born with an exceptional, yet to everyone else (of course) unusual, talent in music. Feeling lonesome and neglected, Evan goes searching for his parents in New York, where their fates meet many years ago. Turns out his parents are alive, but are also separated from each other and doesn't even know he's alive. Along the way, Evan stumbles upon a streetwise monger named Wizard (Robin Williams) who takes him in but sees his exceptional talents as profitable (he also changes his name to August Rush at this point). He also stumbles upon a church where the people there are also at awe with his talents. The film builds up about as fast as that summary I just wrote. Too fast! And that's the problem. How can we invest our emotions on an admittedly decent story if we can't even spend enough time to. One moment Dylan/August is an ambitious little performer, then he's suddenly a little celebrity in the hands of Wizard. One moment he just stumbles into a church, then faster than you can say 'this phrase is so totally clich√©' he's studying in Juilliard! Slow down movie! Granted there are a lot of plot points this movie has to go through (another problem), but moving at an all too rapid pace doesn't help. It never does! Then the story of Dylan/August also intercuts with the story of his parents, Lyla (Keri Russell) and Louis (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), from that fateful night they met to a couple of years later until they realize that they actually have a son. And it does so pretty... badly. In fact, it actually becomes rather confusing in a while. So with so much happening in the movie but very little time to care about them, AUGUST RUSH feels like a Hallmark TV movie rather than a really good fairy tale which it could have been. I'm all for a movie that doesn't try to be realistic and just goes for an artistic sensibility, but it's hard to care about it here. Granted, the performances are good, the camera work is decent, the soundtrack rather good actually, and like I said, I kinda liked the story. If the movie actually spent much of its time developing the story rather than getting them over with and move on to the next, it might have been great. This is one of those movies where I actually don't mind if it ran for an hour or so more, as long as the story is engaging and well-developed. There's just so much potential in it that I started picturing a different movie in my head while watching it. OK, I'm not boasting that I can do a better job, but if the movie can make me think I could then it's loosing my attention. So AUGUST RUSH is not a bad movie, but it's a very maudlin, disappointing one. So much potential lost in execution.",5,0,1,10 May 2011
Inception," Summer movie perfection!
","My Rating: **** out of 4.The serving of brains in a summer movie is always a welcome surprise from the usual servings of empty-headed potboilers and explosive non-thrillers, and INCEPTION, the latest film in a continued winning-streak of DARK KNIGHT-director Christopher Nolan, is a perfect change of pace from disappointing releases such as JONAH HEX or THE LAST AIRBENDER. It's not just smart, obscure, visionary and mind-bogglingly exhilarating, it also has its share of action-packed thrills and chases to keep us hooked but to dwell on them would distance ourselves to the point of the movie. Nolan's take on a summer movie is far more challenging and in a way riskier: Instead of blowing stuff up, he blows our minds instead.Reportedly, Nolan has been developing the script for INCEPTION for over 10 years. That's pretty much like the scene in the movie where Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) asks his new architect/accomplice Ariadne (Ellen Page) to device a maze that Cobb would find difficult. And after 10 years, this year, Nolan has finished his. Finally, the finished product is obscure enough to keep our minds ticking and, sometimes, our patience tested. Nolan, like Ariadne, has taken all the previous possibilities and attempts and pushes it further to the point of obscurity, but in the end the theme stays the same. The answers to INCEPTION are in plain sight; Nolan was just the perfect architect at keeping us challenged and lost in his 'maze' for 148 minutes until the film finally lets us come to grips with what it truly is about. Like THE MATRIX, INCEPTION tries to question the very fabric of reality itself.Inception means the creation or beginning of something; an idea for that matter. Inception is the opposite of Extraction, which is the field of expertise of Cobb and his crew, including his long-time associate Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), master-of-deception Eames (Tom Hardy), his new architect Ariadne, and a chemist Yusuf (Dileep Rao). Extraction is entering the subconscious mind of another during dream state, and steal whatever value however inaccessible information or secrets. But a rich businessman named Saito (Ken Watanabe) approaches him with a proposal; he wishes that Cobb and his crew carry out Inception (instead of stealing an idea, they will plant an idea instead), the target being a young business rival named Robert Fischer, Jr. (Cillian Murphy). To reveal any further (pretty sure there are still a number of people haven't seen it yet) would be risky, though I doubt it would do much difference. Anything you might have already heard about the movie, no matter how crucial it is to the fabric of the story, would not be too much of a spoiler; whether or not it reveals anything, you still have to see the movie to see how it adds up. Even the trailers (the best I've seen for a movie this year) reveal only the basic idea of the plot, but not its deeper themes. It works of course, since now more than ever, people are too used to spoon-feeding plot descriptions; there are just too little surprises because the trailers show too much of its 'you've got to see this!' stuff and saves very little to the actual movie.It's funny how INCEPTION is about people invading the minds of geniuses, because after seeing the movie, I wanted to 'Extract' whatever made Nolan think of such heavy mind-bending ideas presented in the film, just as I wanted to know what goes on in the mind of Alfred Hitchcock when he made VERTIGO (which, upon closer inspection, actually shares a few common themes with INCEPTION). Is INCEPTION Chris Nolan's masterpiece? As in THE masterpiece? Who knows? Knowing what a successful and fruitful career the man has had with only eight films (most of which are instant classics) in his belt, more is yet to come. As of now, I'd say I'll see INCEPTION twice in the mean time, or more when the DVD comes.",Null,3,8,31 July 2010
Carrie," A poignant 'horror' movie.
","Rating: **** out of 4.Brian De Palma's career took of with the success of this adaptation of Stephen King's first novel (who also boosted King's own success) about a teenage girl with telekinetic powers, using it to enslave her high school bullies during the most unforgettably horrifying prom night in history. CARRIE was a box-office hit and became an famous entry in the horror genre. But surprisingly when I saw CARRIE for the first time, I enjoyed it for more than being JUST a horror movie. Have you ever seen a horror movie that is touching and heartwarming? Or a horror movie where the supposed monster or horror is depicted as a sympathetic outcast? Or a horror movie that, before descending into a bloodbath, is staged as a romance? CARRIE has it all. It's a horror movie as well as a send-up of one. De Palma knows that the movie isn't really much about Carrie's telekinetic abilities, but about Carrie herself.An icon of every high school outcast ever since, Carrie (played perfectly by Sissy Spacek) is depicted less as the violent monster she would eventually be and is depicted like anyone else who is bullied by popular kids in school and tormented by an oppressive parent. In that way, De Palma and Spacek is able to make us sympathize for Carrie as a nice girl who is pushed too far, making her now famous Greek tragedy-inspired finale all the more affecting. Piper Laurie is superb in an Oscar-nominated role (rare for a horror movie at the time) as Carrie's tormenting mother Margaret, who believes that her innocent girl is proof of her sinfulness. Laurie is both disturbing and devilishly campy, making her character one of the most memorable in the whole genre. Nancy Allen plays the notorious Chris Hargensen, a representation of the 'Most Popular Girl' in high school, while Amy Irving plays the opposite in the role of Sue, a character who feels guilty for treating Carrie like dirt. William Katt plays her sweetheart who asks Carrie to the prom as an informal apology from Sue to Carrie. Betty Buckley provides the nice teacher role (a much nicer character here than in the book) who takes young Carrie under her wing. Oh, and watch out for John Travolta as Chris' nothing-but-trouble boyfriend.I hate it when some audiences from our generation look back on CARRIE is a campy, scare-free 'horror' movie. Why, look for some cheap 'gotcha' moments that aren't there? CARRIE is more than just the now-usual treatment of horror movies; it's a mature and affecting tragedy of sorts. How many horror movies these days are portrayed with sympathy and warmth that CARRIE had in its smaller moments? In the end, the movie is something that may not be scary, but its rather poignant and sad. In fact, I think some of the horror elements of the film are portrayed as intentionally campy, but that's just me.CARRIE is also a visual tour-de-force, with some memorable use of color and other visual techniques to drive the story. De Palma's trademark split-screen makes an appearance here during the famous 'Prom Night' sequence. The film also has some underlying satire on high school life, during the 70's and even today. In fact, watching CARRIE today gives a few insights that probably wasn't a big deal back in the 70's.CARRIE is a masterpiece in the genre, and one of the most touching, funny, most tragic, and one of the most memorable horror movies ever.",Null,2,3,30 January 2011
Rear Window," Still one of the best ever! Hitchcock in prime form.
","Rating: **** out of 4.Hitchcock is really at the top of his game in the 1950's and REAR WINDOW might as well be his most successful. Here is a genuine Alfred Hitchcock movie sprinkled with suspense, humor, and romance unlike any movie of its time, and in fact, any movie today. While it's not as deep, dark and personal as his 1958 masterpiece VERTIGO, this is nonetheless his ultimate triumph in establishing his title; 'The Master of Suspense'. Has there ever been a more suspenseful moment in film history than the scene where one of our plucky characters brakes in on the suspect's apartment, while the suspect is just about to come home? Well, if there were, then it would have owed a debt of gratitude to this Hitchcock masterpiece.The story revolves around L.B. 'Jeff' Jeffries (James Stewart, in a role that's pretty much James Stewart in character), a photographer who gets wheelchair-ridden when he caught himself in an accident (Hitchcock did a much better job at telling you about Jeff's background in an early scene where the camera pans through his works and his camera, and eventually the last picture he ever took before the accident; a rear that was about the crash into him). Jeff, with nothing to do, basically does what every neighbor would do: look out the window and watch his neighbors' everyday lifestyle. Be it the ballerina, dubbed Ms. Torso (Georgine Darcy), or the hopeless romantic old lady, dubbed Ms. Lonelyhearts (Judith Evelyn), Jeff has seen 'em all, including a man named Lars Throwald (pre-PERRY MASON Raymond Burr) who one day stops talking to his demanding, invalid wife in the bedroom and starts cleaning up what seemed to be blood stains in the bathroom. Did Jeff see a murder happening just right across the block, or was it just a case of a Peeping Tom having delusions? Hitchcock occasionally puts aside this story and explores what many see as the core of the film: The romance. Jeff and his relationship to his high-class but spunky and stubborn socialite girlfriend Lisa Freemont (the irreplaceable Grace Kelly in her irreplaceable role) is one of the reasons why REAR WINDOW is one of the best. In fact, Hitchcock himself knew the importance of the love story in the movie, that he made sure that the whole plot revolved around it. The neighbors around Jeff's apartment, from Ms Lonelyhearts to Ms. Torso and a couple of newlyweds next door all suggest what might happen to Jeff and Lisa as time went on with their relationship. The Thorwalds represent the darker side of their relationship: the possibility that they would hate each other as an old married couple.This along with a dozen more elements (performances, music, atmosphere, direction, EVERYTHING) make REAR WINDOW the quintessential Alfred Hitchcock movie. It's funny, it's romantic, it's clever, and it's suspenseful as hell. That last act had me by the neck and it would never let go. Now that's suspense!",Null,0,1,29 December 2010
Saboteur," Not Hitchcock's best, but a fine thriller still. Great set-pieces.
","Rating: *** out of 4.Alfred Hitchcock was not on the top of his game in SABOTEUR, an Americanized version of his own 39 STEPS, littered with propaganda elements; like his superb thriller THE FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, this Hitchcock thriller was used to promote awareness of 'the enemy'. But even if SABOTEUR won't be remembered as his best work, and one that certainly won't be outdo its own prototype, it's still a fine crackling good yarn that occasionally lulls but mostly interests.Robert Cummings (who later would work again for Hitch in the arguably better DIAL M FOR MURDER) plays Barry Kane, an aircraft factory worker who is framed for setting the factory on fire, resulting the death of one of his own friends. Sadly, his friend and another fellow named Fry (Norman Lloyd), are the only witnesses, and one is dead and the other is on the run. Now, as any Hitchcock character would do, Kane runs out to find the true saboteur and along the way he picks up a blonde companion named Pat Martin (Pricilla Lane) who has no use but to trust him despite her doubts.There are a number of bizarrely humorous moments in the film, particularly in a scene where Kane and Pat hitches a ride with a couple of circus freaks (!). This probably has a lot to do with the fact that author Dorothy Parker is a collaborator. A number of memorable set-pieces give the film edge and excitement; there's a second attempt at sabotage on a ship setting sale, a shootout in a theater (that mirrors the film itself), and the finale on top of the Statue of Liberty (a fight for liberty, perhaps?).Overall, a pretty flawed but nonetheless engaging film.",Null,2,4,30 January 2011
