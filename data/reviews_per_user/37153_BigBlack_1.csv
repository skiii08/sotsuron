Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," disappointment
","I was extremely disappointed with this stupid movie.  I was expecting something along the line of one of the first three movies--was I wrong. The movie was made for ten year old boys, not someone who was 26 years old when Star Wars I came out.  I will probably see the next one--hope it is better that that piece of over-hyped trash. Has George Lucas lost it?",Null,0,1,13 June 1999
