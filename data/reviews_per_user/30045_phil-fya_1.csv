Skyfall," Terrible Movie, Period!
","I check out reviews here at IMDb for many years now and it really shocked me to read that critics and some fans here liked this bond movie! I have seen all bond movies more than once and after watching quantum of solace i said to myself that the bond series just cannot get worse, but after watching skyfall i am sorry to say that it just did, i have no idea how they made such a bad movie but they just did! You can just enter and read some reviews that people have written here at IMDb saying how awful it is, they are all correct! In general let me say that the movie is to long, the script is full of goofs (you don't have to be smart to notice them), there are just countless mistakes throughout the entire plot, and the worse thing is that it is not really a bond movie, there is no glamor, no finesses, no sophistication or imagination what so ever and the scene that ends the movie is just plain silly, not reliable even for a movie that's suppose to be A fantasy thriller, it's actually embarrassing how uncreative the production cast was. A last comment, I do not understand why craig is receiving so many compliments, i doubt that he himself believes it as so far he is arguably the worse bond there ever was, the worse! And that says much doesn't it?!",1,14,28,17 February 2013
