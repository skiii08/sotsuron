Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's an intergalactic Muppet Show
","This movie shows that Mr. Lucas is now rather a businessman than an artist. This film is for kids, a 2 Hour computer game, a feast of special effects. Do not have any doubts: this movie is about Money. That's all. Oh yeah, the podracer and the lightsaber scenes are cool. And what? There was a few cool scenes even in Soldier, but the film sucked. This film also sucks. It lacks the spirit that New Hope and Empire had. The commercialization of the whole Lucas Empire started with the Jedi, with all the silly ewoks and the monsters in Jabba's Palace. But even Jedi was a better film than Menace.In this movie, there are no dialogues, the better performance was delivered by Artoo Detoo. Jar Jar is simply childish. The whole movie is childish.",Null,0,1,20 May 1999
