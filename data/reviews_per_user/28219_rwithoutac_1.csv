The New World," I was expecting much more
","'The thin red line' is most certainly one of the best war movies ever : Terrence Malick has built a masterpiece by avoiding all the usual 'clich√©s' you find in any war movie. Sadly, he hasn't been able to do the same here : his Indians are man children, Pocahantas spends most of her time chasing butterflies and praying, and the movie suffers from a simplistic approach of the matter. In the end, Terrence Malick does not deliver the same smart, unusual, emotional work of art as he did with 'The thin red line'. We are left with beautiful pictures and landscapes, great music and undeniable poetry (some scenes are very close to 'The thin red line'), and a powerful end (I must admit). However, I was expecting so much more from this talented man.",5,7,11,21 February 2006
