The Ring," Awful!
","I'm a horror film fan from way back, and I love a good scare. I was really looking forward to this film. The trailer made it look great. Unfortunately the film makes absolutely no sense and isn't scary in the least -- unless you're frightened by images reminiscent of some old Nine Inch Nails video.I can't figure out why a great actress like Naomi Watts would do a film like this after her success with Mulholland Drive. Maybe they offered her a lot of money? I guess.The movie is terrible -- completely stupid. You want an example? A little girl is suffocated by her mother in the early 1950s using a plastic trash bag. Uh, like they had Glad Bags back then? And that's a small goof in a film full of them, though I won't mention any more here.Don't waste your time or money on this. Wait till it shows up on the SciFi channel or someplace like that to check it out.",Null,0,0,19 October 2002
Donnie Darko," MAD WORLD
","What an amazing film! Beautiful and frightening, funny and sad and deep all at the same time. Terrific performances, a haunting score, and most instrumentally, a thoroughly original storyline that blooms into multiple interpretations before your eyes. It's had a slow time making it into the public's consciousness but this film will undoubtedly become a major cult classic of the same stature as BLUE VELVET or BEING JOHN MALKOVICH. Kudos to all involved. I can't get that wonderfully icy cover of Tears for Fears's MAD WORLD out of my head! DON'T MISS THIS FILM.",Null,0,0,29 March 2002
