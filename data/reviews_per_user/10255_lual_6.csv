The Sound of Music," tacky dreck
","When I was an exchange student in the USA many years ago, my host-father showed me this film as being his favorite movie which he has seen in the cinema many times when it came out and still watches regularly ever since. I had never heard of that movie and since I am quite fond of musicals, I gave it a try.Now, I dearly love my host-father, but I really hate this movie. I have seen it twice so far, once with him to get to know it and once a few months ago when it was shown on German TV for the first time (!!). But the second time I only watched it to play Mystery Science Theater 3000 with some of my friends.The reason why this movie had never been shown on German TV before was because the German language track had been lost for many years and was only rediscovered by accident a while ago. But why did nobody in the German speaking region care to find the language track of this much beloved movie earlier? The main reason is that this movie, though it may have been successful in most parts of the world, was not so in Germany, Austria or Switzerland - and for good reason.Everything in this movie is just sooooooooooooooo terrible clichÃ©! The cinematography, the dresses, the way everybody behaves.... ugh! If this is the way Americans look at Austria (or Germany and Switzerland, since I have the feeling that many do not really know the differences between these countries) than we really have a lot to do to correct this picture.But there is another reason, why I don't like this movie. It is really insulting to one's intelligence. The whole thing feels like it was made for kids (and done badly), everybody is virtuous, smiling all the time, bouncing around happily running through the countryside just enjoying being alive. Above all they sing songs that could come out of Sesame Street. Actually I was expecting a song that teaches you how to count to ten to pop up any minute. Come on! This is not beautiful, it is just plain dumb!There was a German oder Austrian movie made in the fifties called 'Die Trapp Familie' and following its success, a sequel was produced later about their life in the US. The fifties in the history of German movies were notorious for the tacky 'Heimatfilme' (homeland movies) that were produced in this era portraying Germany and Austria as happy beautiful places where happy people lived who did nothing but smile and enjoy the countryside all day long. 'Die Trapp Familie' was one of these bad movies, but even this movie did not come close to the abomination that is 'The Sound of Music'. At least the former had some level, albeit small, of realism.I like Julie Andrews as an actress and singer, but this movie was not only not saved by her performance, but made even worse. I hope they put the German language track back on the dusty shelf where they found it and never show this movie in Germany again.",1,49,126,17 June 2006
Se7en," It stays with you
","Se7en is an excellent thriller. Sure, it might be a little bit over-stylized and the ending is not quite as logical as it seems to be at first, but none of that disturbs the experience of watching this film.Every aspect of it is superb, the writing, the actors, the editing, the sound, the music, the direction.I am not going to repeat the plot yet again.I just want to point out what makes this film so special: It stays with you. After the first viewing, the images are burnt into your head, the ending leaves you drained and broken and you will think about it for days. Even though the effect wears off after repeated viewing, you can always remember the way you felt after your first experience with this movie. it is so strong that you can even remember it if someone just mentions its name. It is the kind of movie of which you never forget where you saw it first, who was with you and what it was like. I watched it in a cinema 13 years ago and can still remember the exact mood of that evening.This, in my opinion, is the greatest accomplishment a film can achieve.",10,1,2,3 May 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," 'Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention pu-lease'
","I had been looking forward to seeing this movie for such a long time! Since it won't come out in Germany until February 12th I had to wait even longer than the American audience. Well, I finally got to see it and here is my review.First off, I think on its own terms the movie is extraordinary! Truly one of the greatest movies of the past year. When it started I was at first put off by the picture of the Tower Bridge (which did not exist an the time in which the movie is set) but I quickly got over it and just followed along.The whole look of the movie is incredible. The costumes, the production design, the wigs, everything fits together perfectly. This is probably, along with 'Batman Returns', the one where Burton captured his German-Exypressionism-Look best. Everything is just a little bit twisted and shabby yet somehow beyond all the filth there is something glorious about it.The actors are just as great. Helena Bonham-Carter makes for a very funny Mrs. Lovett, even though she decided to play it down a little bit from the usual hysterical stage version and make her a human rather than a complete maniac. Depp seems to be channeling Heath Ledger's 'Brokeback Mountain'-performance judging by the way he constantly clenches his teeth together. Because of this decision his singing often sounds like he is hissing the sounds through his teeth, but it fits just well with his performance. I like the decision to make the main characters not too exaggerated as they often are on stage. It might fit there, but here this portrayal seems so much more realistic and adds to the effect of the movie. Of the entire -wonderful- cast, there are only two characters who are completely overplayed: Timothy Spall's Beadle and Sasha Baron Cohen's Pirelli. But this as well adds to the movie and helps making these people characters you just love to hate, in the case of the Beadle perhaps even more than the Jugde.The gore-level is very high and the throat slitting seems to be the most real thing in the entire movie. This is a very courageous decision as it makes you squirm even though you are entertained. Whereas the stage-version is often darkly comical the movie is rather macabre and the viewer can feel how painful death can be (and still can't wait for the next death). This makes the movie very bitter-sweet and makes it stay with you a lot longer. I was actually surprised that Burton did not go all the way and decided not to show Toby's fate as it would have made the ending even more heartbreaking. But that would have been just the icing on the cake.And now the one thing that makes me take off one star of the movie: It really sounds like I am one of these elitists if I compare it to the stage version and I really don't mean to. In fact, if you don't know the stage version you will not miss anything at all. But since I have seen it I have to compare it automatically. Make no mistake, everything that's here is great, no complains. I just sometimes wished that some of the abbreviated songs had been intact in the movie. I know why Burton cut them and I understand his decision but since I think the choires are so integral to the musical I would have preferred it if he had kept them in a few songs, most notably 'God that's good' and 'Pirelli's Miracle Elixir'. Sometimes it simply felt like the songs were just hinted at instead of really performed. And for 'A little Priest' I would have preferred had Depp and Bonham-Carter made it just a little bit more lively. There is no need to make it the wild number it is on stage, but it is a sweeping waltz after all.. A little more than just staring out of the window would have been nice.But enough of that. I can only advise everyone, even non-lovers of musicals, to see this movie. You probably won't be disappointed - as long as you don't mind the blood.",9,0,1,15 February 2008
The Matrix Revolutions," just awful
","I never walk out of the cinema while a movie is still playing. Though I go to the movies regularly, I choose the movies I watch carefully and inform myself. I build up an expectation based on this and I have rarely been completely disappointed. Most of the time I like the movie I am watching, sometimes it falls below my expectation. But it hardly ever happens that I hate a movie when I walk out of the theater. But there have been two times when I hated a movie so much that I almost left the cinema. The first time was 'Boat Trip' (which was a sneak preview, I had no idea they were showing this, I assure you I would never have chosen that movie out of free will), the second time was while I was watching 'The Matrix Revolutions'.I liked the first Matrix film. i was never a geek or anyone who could talk about the 'meaning' in this movie all the time. Frankly, those people annoyed me and over time, it took a little of my enjoyment of that movie away. But I always recognized it as a visual milestone in cinema.When 'The Matrix reloaded' came out, I went to see it with quite high expectations. I thought it was OK, not as good as the first one, but after all, it was a sequel and those are hardly ever as good as the originals. I loved that it still felt like 'Matrix' to me. It had a lot of the original style and most new characters fit into that. What I did not like was all that heavy dialog. The things the Architect said made me mad. Listening to it, I got the feeling that what was actually being said was something completely banal but the Wachowskys wanted it to sound profound and to have people talk about it so they made it complicated. Still, a nice movie and after the climax, I wanted to know how it would all wrap up.What a disappointment this movie was! Whereas 'The Matrix Reloaded' still had a lot of 'The Matrix' in it, this movie has barely any of the 'Matrix'-feeling in it, but mostly the bad things of 'the Matrix Reloaded'. I never cared much about all this Zion-stuff. Zion to me was the ideal that was built up in the first movie, not that Star Trek -influenced termite hill of the second film. And yet, most of this movie is about that. To top it all of, most of the film is about defending this city, which is done by characters which were all added later while the main characters just vanish or become cyphers.Only two scenes of the movie take place in the matrix, one in the beginning and one at the end. The rest is just robot wars in Zion and trying to get to the Deus Ex Machina.Now, like many others, I also felt let down by the ending. i felt it was a cheap way out of all the stuff the makers of this trilogy had hinted at before. But still, the ending was just the thing that assured me in my overall impression. the entire film had been ruined for me a long time before during all these ridiculous and redundant fighting scenes in Zion.This third installment is so terrible, that it weakens the entire trilogy and even the first movie as a standalone work.The only positive thing that can be said about it is that after that, all that annoying geek talk about the matrix allegories stopped. It seemed like the Wachwskies wanted to give a wake-up call to all those freaks.",1,5,8,4 June 2007
The Mist," One of the best horror movies of all time
","Note: I have added the 'spoiler notice', even though I will not reveal the ending. I will mention its impact on me, though, which, for some, might already count as a spoiler.It is so difficult to get a horror movie right. Quite often, in my opinion, the idea of the horror subject is more frightening than the execution. This applies especially to haunted house stories. But here.... I have to confess, I have rarely ever felt horror as strongly as I did while watching this movie.I haven't read the novella on which the movie is based, but after watching the movie I listened to a radio dramatization and read some stuff on the net and from that I gather that the movie follows the story pretty closely, mostly deviating from it at the end by adding a coda.The story starts quickly, driving the plot forward and the tension builds up gradually. What I really like about the movie is that while there is the 'attack - pause - attack - pause'-rhythm that is typical for horror movies, there is no denouement here in the pauses. While the monsters 'plan' their next attack, it is the humans who drive the action further and in many ways, the story that unfolds here is much more frightening than the monster attacks. The monster stuff is there for the blood and gore, the human story provides the real terror that leaves you chilled. It is this rare combination of different kinds of horror that makes this movie stand out so much.The characters are also completely believable. There is only one scene in which a character seems to react the way he does because of the genre conventions. This is when Mr. Norton strictly refuses to go back to the warehouse to look at the remains of a monster. I felt this to be the only forced moment in the movie where the reaction was not natural, but had to be like this to keep the movie and the tension going.Mrs. Carmody is a pretty risky character that could easily have gone wrong. But with this script and especially through the outstanding performance of Marcia Gay Harden she remains credible and real. I can't believe how many people view this as bashing of religion or Christianity. Mrs. Carmody in my opinion is not a symbol of religion but of orthodoxy and radicalness. If a Christian is offended by her portrayal, I think he should probably check his own motives.Now, for the ending... What an incredible, courageous, terrifying, ruthless ending. When I watched the movie in the theater I couldn't believe what I was watching. This ending, while it is just the icing on the cake, is what will make this film be remembered for a long time. I can completely understand why people hate this ending. It goes against movie conventions (if you haven't seen the movie: don't worry, it is not an open ending, the story gets completely resolved) and will crush you on the floor without picking you up. This part you will have to do on your own. The point is, that this is not just a sad ending, but it stresses the unnecessarity of the actions the main character has taken. And by then giving us just a short look into the face of a woman who had taken a chance early on in the movie and was supposed to be dead but had instead survived, it makes everything even more unbearable.Usually, when a hero dies in the end or something sad happens to him, there is always some sort of closure that what he did was right or that he was a hero of some sort. 'The Mist' denies the viewer this feeling. Instead, it leaves us with a feeling of deep deep pain and uselessness. People who hate the ending and maybe feel betrayed by it, probably mostly hate the fact that they have been lured into identifying with the supposedly wrong character. This guy is not an everyman who goes out of the story with his head held high, but one who makes a mistake, an understandable mistake, that will ruin him forever.A great movie!",10,5,11,14 April 2008
The Dark Knight," I'm not a Batman geek or overexcited teenager, but I still liked this movie a lot
","I really don't like to jump on a band wagon like this. Though I had been longing for this movie for over a year and though I was expecting great things from it, this nerdy and geeky talk of comic book fans ('best movie ever') really got onto my nerves. Living in Germany, I had to wait until yesterday to finally watch the movie and I could watch all the craziness going on on the net from afar. I still wanted to like the movie, but I really feared that all this hype might ruin it for me.Well, now that I have finally seen it I have to say that my fears were to a large part unnecessary. the movie is great and I think it is as good as a movie like this can be. Though I still get annoyed by teenagers who yell that this is the best movie ever, I can understand where they are coming from. Every decade or so there is one movie that becomes a real phenomenon. And if you never experienced this than you become part of the group that says 'this is our movie and we won't let grumpy idiots take it away from us'. When I was at that age for me it was 'Jurassic Park' and later to a certain extent also 'Titanic' and I bet most of the kids who hype this movie have not been consciously around then.I thought the acting was great overall. Heath Ledger definitely stands out. Christian Bale is great, too. His work as the twisted Batman/Bruce Wayne character has to be a lot more subtle in this movie and he achieves that wonderfully. Unfortunately, due to Ledger's tour de force performance, Bale's work seems to go unappreciated by many here. I could go on and on. There is not a single weak performance in this movie (although the Mayor becomes a bit distracting because of his heavy eye-liner, but that's not the actor's fault).I love the scope of this movie. The main storyline is always in focus but there still is room for subplots here and there which are all set up perfectly and fit within the overall plot. And even though you might wish to see more of some characters (like Alfred) you nevertheless don't feel that they were underused. The pacing is great as well. You keep being interested the entire time and the movie flows so naturally that you never get the feeling that this action sequence here happens because there has to be an action sequence.So, is this the best movie ever? I leave that up to everyone to decide for himself. It is not perfect but no movie, even the best, is completely flawless. There are things in this movie that I didn't like too much. I wish they had done more with Two-Face and the whole bit about the cell phones seemed a bit gimmicky for me (I also didn't like Batman's eyes in these scenes).But there is so much to like in this film. One has to applaud the filmmakers for going against conventions by for example killing of characters not just at the climax of the movie but right in the middle. I also loved it that the movie does not end with the big machine of the villain that he has to start in order to rule the world (even 'Batman begins' fell into that trap). They found a perfectly neat solution to it all and though I think the ending is not perfect, I think it still is great as it is.The same thing can be said about the whole movie. I love it that the script of this movie is so smart that it even takes time to ask philosophical questions. Sure, it doesn't go too deep but it is mentioned in a way that most moviegoers will be able to think about this.I had a perfect time at the cinema and think that for what it is, this movie can indeed be called a masterpiece.",10,9,17,22 August 2008
