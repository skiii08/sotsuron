Lucky Number Slevin," wonderful!
","What an excellent movie!!! My boyfriend had to drag me to it, but it turned out to be great! We figured it out before the end... but sooooo much better then the other stuff out there from previous months. (He figured out half and I figured out the other half). Please add to the quotes section as there are lots of great ones! I was not looking forward to a Bruce Willis movie, but I got so caught up in the movie that I forgot it was him! Imagine that! Josh Hartnett also gave a great performance, with his co-star Lucy-Liu (I didn't notice the boobage that has been reported by others). Unsurprisingly, Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley were wonderful. A similar movie is 'The Usual Suspects.' with Kevin Spacey.",10,1,7,8 April 2006
