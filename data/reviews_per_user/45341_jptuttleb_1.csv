E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," E.T. - Definitely NOT Steven Spielberg's Best Work
","E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial displayed some amazing special effects on the screen for the time. However, some of the content and scenarios in the film are unnecessary and/or confusing. A good portion of foul language is used, including anatomical references. There is other crude visual content. There are some areas of the story that are vague and hard to understand, such as when a fully geared astronaut comes barging through a window. Also, inexplicably, the young main character is somehow connected to E.T. the little alien, as if together they are one entity. An adult briefly notes that the little alien appeared to him too as a boy, a very minor thing which is never explored further than the original comment. Multiple references to the Star Wars franchise (costumes, toys, and the like) are made in this movie. John Williams, the Star Wars musical composer, composed the scores for E.T. too. All considered, the film's story-line is pretty poorly done.",6,1,4,7 June 2017
