Skyfall," and... it fails!
","so, Bond is back and Sam Mendes made the brilliant job of cocking it up. Well, the script wasn't brilliant to begin with, but wtf? The only thing that is worth in this movie is the ending (which by the way is really good) but it's there to move you along to the other two Bond movies that Craig still has under contract. The rest of the film? Rubbish! the villain is bad, the girls? Well, (yes there are two) one is moneypenny and the other one don't bother to grasp why she's there because they didn't... So, you get an old Bond that drinks, takes pills and the 'mileage' is starting to affect him; he pretends to be dead then comes back for queen and country. Fails the field agent tests but gets to active duties nonetheless. Searches for villain (really boring part of the movie), gets no gadgets from a new Q (zero past character build on that one also) and finds the bad guy - a former 00 and a computer genius that can do whatever he wants on a laptop (so he claims). Objective? Kill M. Why did he let Bond get to him? Dunno! Why didn't he blew up M along with her office? (yes he blew up headquarters) dunno! Why not release the list of undercover agents and destroy M reputation quickly? Dunno! And there's more stuff like this. NO COMMON SENSE... Conclusion: back to Charlies Angel's type Bond. Highly improbable, no sense, far away from Connery and even really worse than the last two. Oh, and Barden was terrible in this film, seamed uncomfortable and kinda off balance with the character. This is why Bourne movies (the first two anyway) were everything Bond used to be. And why Bond was getting back on track. The problem is that they have to make a new one every two or so years and take any script that comes along. But go for it anyway. Go for a coffee and get inside at the middle of the movie: you catch it really fast and you don't want to miss the end. The rest is just a pile of bs...",5,30,61,2 November 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Terrible movie!
","The characters are void of purpose most of the movie; terrible explanation of why and who are the 'people' raising against the status quo; fighting scenes that are worst than Chinese B movies (knocking a guy out with a box is not acceptable anymore, or a dozen armed men choosing to wait those extra seconds just enough to fail and then trowing punches at the bat instead of using the guns in the first place), the whole bruce wayne goes to 'hell on earth' prison that ends up to be a hole with a bunch of old farts where all he does are some sit-ups... come on, it's just plane wrong. But the piece de resistance is when the bat tops the line 'a hero can just be the guy who puts a coat over a children's shoulders and let's him know the world is yadadada...'. I mean, after the dark knight with Ledger, pfffff, this is simply WRONG! Oh, and the end... why make a whole plan to get the bomb to a designated place with all the work involved if all you needed to do was grab a cable and lift it to the sea? I mean, this movie is right there along Charlie's angels and stuff like that. Where's the power punch of the first two? This sucks! Big time!",1,140,247,9 August 2012
