Blade Runner 2049," A 'keep it to the essential' review
","Is this a worthy sequel to one of the greatest films ever made? Yes.Does it achieve or surpass the brilliance of the original? No.Are there surprises compared to your usual Hollywood blockbuster? Yes.Are there surprises comparable to Villeneuve's Francophone films? No.Will this likely win Academy Awards for F/X, cinematography and camera? Yes.Will this likely win Academy Awards for any of the actors? No. Liev Schreiber and Robin Wright make a lot out of very little though.Why will some people love this movie? The optics. The sound effects. Nostalgia. There's nothing else worth watching on the big screen - don't wait to watch this at home, you'll probably be disappointed.Why will some people loathe this movie? The story makes very little sense. The plot holes are as deep as the Grand Canyon. It drags in the middle for about 30 minutes. The villains are comic book material. From a female perspective the women in here may seem written awkwardly.In short: It's definitely worth seeing, but not an epiphany. There's a chance for another sequel, but I hope they'll give it a pass.",7,2,12,5 October 2017
Black Swan," If you love your ballet - stay away!
","When a movie is being hyped to a substantial degree, there is always a risk that this is not exactly due to its merit, but rather part of an aggressive marketing campaign. Rarely has such a phenomena been so obvious as prior to the release of 'Black Swan': the media have been up and running about Portman's real-life romance sparked during its filming, plus pondering the chances of 'Black Swan' establishing ballet as a fashion trend. Still, having been partnered with a dancer for a number of years, I couldn't resist the temptation - as a result of which I have to side with those reviewers here who regard it as an utterly pointless affair.What bothered me slightly were the abundant factual errors in depicting a dance company, although that's where most of the action takes place. Even overlooking the myth of the all-powerful choreographer who can choose his lead at random and at any given time: to have the lead's antagonist being chosen as her substitute almost at the end of the film is a quite unnecessary blunder. Even the friend I was watching the film with asked me if such an important matter were not decided earlier on. Other incoherences were Winona Ryder's character - a lead isn't likely to be fired like that - and Vincent Cassel's character - a choreographer engaging in such rampant displays of sexual harassment wouldn't be likely to make creative director. Add the stereotypical career mom of Portman's stereotypically fretting artiste, plus the stereotypically venomous scheming antagonist, and voilà, there's your assembly of paper-thin characters in a papier-mâché world.What bothered me more about 'Black Swan' was the excessive use of special effects to drive its already not-quite-so-hard-to-understand message home: feathers growing out of scratches, talking photos and the much-used eye-liner-enhanced demonic expression of the transformed 'Black Swan' made me wish to metaphorically grab Aronofsky by the collar and scream: Enough of this already! I-GOT-THE-PICTURE!!! Stop goofing off and go ahead with the story, g-dd-mm-t! The problem with this being that, had the plot been as straight forward as in Aronofsky's much better 'Wrestler', the runtime would have hardly exceeded 30 minutes.However, what bothers me most about 'Black Swan' is its complete lack of respect for its subject matter. Hitherto all dance films have somehow attempted to grasp the particular mix of hard work and inspiration this art form demands and presents like no other. Yet although this issue is pretty much the crux of Black Swan's story, it fails to feature a full dance scene; instead, there are snippets of real and imaginary dance-inflicted wounds, and a steady-cam rotating around its star, thereby consciously ignoring the essence of ballet per se: its effect as an ensemble piece. Anybody who has ever seen 'Swan Lake' or any other ballet piece, for that matter, will probably concur that the interaction between dancers is at least as important as their individual talent. 'Black Swan' makes it almost seem as if a lead dancer is something like the star of a Las Vegas show. The only thing missing is Portman smattering a catchy tune out of her shiny black lips.One may argue that accuracy is not what the film is about, that it is a psychological thriller. But why make use of the black swan/ white swan metaphor of the piece, and then detach the whole story from the piece and the art that inspires it? Even those who liked the film should ask themselves: does this movie really address ballet in any way but that very metaphor? And isn't the whole story revolving around such an obvious analogy completely pointless? Another sign of disrespect to me is the investment of 'Swan Lake', which as a mainstay of classical ballet can be said to be a part of an unquestionable cultural heritage, with a highly cliché and passé Freudian repressed-sexuality-slash-schizophrenia gimmick. Not only is such an approach rather pompous and shallow, but it is also inadvertently funny; the means by which the lead character attempts to relieve herself earned quite a few snickers in the audience I was in. Imagine a 90-minute-film about the sexual symbolism of 'Hansel & Gretel', and you'll get an idea what to intellectually expect, and a conclusion which - I have to concur with a number of other reviews - is painfully easy to figure out.In short: the most over-hyped and annoying film I've seen in a long time. Definitely not for dance enthusiasts. If you're looking for a psychological thriller in the world of entertainment, try the anime 'Perfect Blue', which judging from Black Swan's style seems to be familiar to Aronofsky. And better dance films? Just pick any of them, from 'The Red Shoes' to 'Billy Elliot' - they all have more to say about the art of and devotion to dance than this one.",1,226,389,22 January 2011
Your Name.," if you know your anime, don't expect too much
","To be sure, 'Your Name' is now at a domestic B.O. of $140 million among the 50 most successful traditionally animated films of all time, it establishes Makoto Shinkai firmly as the new great hope of animated film, and it does feature the most brilliant lighting effects ever produced. If you don't know any previous works by Shinkai and his company Comics Wave, chances are you'll be blown away. If you are, however, familiar with his work, you may catch yourself wondering what all the fuss is about.There isn't anything new here - the intertwined time-lines were the main feat of his '5 Centimeters per Second' (2007), and the asteroids and fantastic themes dominated his debut feature 'The Place promised in our early Days' (2004), which I personally hold to be his best work.Why then this sudden enormous success? Well, Miyazaki has stopped directing, and Ghibli has been on hiatus for two years. The equally brilliant Mamoru Hosoda's films have topics more domestic to Japan, and because of this his latest film 'The Boy and the Beast' had only a limited US release. I'd still say that his 'Wolf Children' (2012) and 'The Girl who leapt through Time' (2006) are far superior to Shinkai because of their complex story lines, and because you can watch those over and over again. His style is also more reminiscent of Miyazaki.But right now, it's Shinkai's hour, and to be sure, it's well deserved that he finally gets so much international exposure. Only I very much doubt that he will be able to replicate this success, because the novelty first-time viewers may experience now will surely wear off if he sticks to his well-established themes.",8,10,19,18 October 2016
Argo," Decent film, horrible timing (for anything but the Oscars)
","While this is indeed an interesting retelling of a 'truth-larger-than-fiction' event during the Iranian hostage crisis, and while it's OK that it focuses entirely on the American perspective of the task of liberating six escaped embassy staff members, I cannot help but feel uncomfortable about the timing of this film.We're looking at the possibility of yet another war, after all, and the widespread hostility towards Iran as a nation is where the support for this film cunningly taps from. There is an introductory admission that the Iranian Revolution was the direct result of the US reinstatement of the absolutist Shah, who ruled via his suppressive secret police SAVAK. What's not mentioned, however, is that SAVAK was trained by CIA officers under the supervision of Herbert Norman Schwarzkopf, father of Norman Schwarzkopf who commanded Operation Desert Storm. So the rampant displays of Anti-Americanism are, as far as Iran is concerned, not without reason, and one would have wished that, in these sensitive times, the almost documentary style approach Affleck has chosen would consider this; after all, in the case of other countries (such as Chile) it is meanwhile generally accepted that such policies were crimes. SAVAK also has a special history with Germany (my country of residence), for their clashes with leftist protesters on the occasion of the Shah's state visit in 1967 was the starting point of the student revolution of '68, which eventually swept all across Western Europe. This event has been shockingly reconstructed in the first ten minutes of Uli Edel's 'Baader Meinhof Komplex' (2008).To be sure, it's a fascinating story, its pace and perspective are logically focused on the planning of the rescue and the plight of the persons concerned. However, Iranians are reduced to a backdrop of a fanaticized mob, and that must make anyone who's actually been there feel rather queasy. The only sympathetic Iranian character throughout this film is the (briefly shown) crew's guide; when the 'film crew' tours a bazaar there is a hostile altercation with an angry mob over the taking of a photograph; the Canadian ambassador's maid is a traitor... a little more balance or just one scene with dialogue for one of the Iranian characters could have relieved the feeling of this being a propaganda effort, but instead we get a lot of patriotic 'no-one-gets-left-behind' talk, and an unnecessary chase scene which evidently didn't happen.The way it plays, 'Argo' could well be interpreted as a rallying call for yet another war - AKA 'we've got every reason to bomb 'em for humiliating us 32 years ago'. And I was really hoping that Americans have grown tired of this, since it didn't work so well the last ten years. 'Charlie Wilson's War' (about financing Afghanistan's mujahedeen and then letting them slip out of control once the Russians were gone) was a lot more honest.In short, Iran is not the country you might think it is after watching this film, as last year's foreign language Oscar-winning film 'A Separation' perfectly illustrates. What these times need is a documentary effort about the thousands of Iranians living in the US since the Islamic revolution, and what their hopes and fears for the state and future of their country are. Update: now there is one, it's called 'The Iranian Americans', was screened on PBS and is available for free online streaming.",6,2,5,1 December 2012
The Danish Girl," Trite, sentimental waste of an important subject
","A non-biographical biopic, 'The Danish Girl' is one of the worst attempts at mainstreaming an LGBT-themed story I have ever had the displeasure to see. It takes far too many liberties with the real lives of its principal characters Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener, and reduces an interesting story and relationship to a superficial tear-jerker, albeit an excellently photographed one.As in the book, Gerda Wegener's sexual identity is completely neglected, and Lili Elbe's transition is initially portrayed less than identity awakening and rather than role-play. Redmayne as Elbe is thoroughly miscast - it's really, really time by now to have trans parts played by trans people. He plays the character like an effeminate gay man, and if you have trans friends, you will understand how untrue that is. Vikander is doing OK with an underwritten role which shies away from the less romantic real story - for instance, Wegener was not present when Elbe died. Whishaw's character is completely superfluous. Sebastian Koch owes his presence to a big German contribution to the film's budget - still, the most interesting part of the story, the reassignment procedure he is carrying out, is dismissed by a sloppy, predictable script.As some of you may know, there was an LGBT campaign to get 'Tangerine' nominated for an Academy Award. That film is low budget, features actual Trans actresses and (almost) avoids cliché. If it wasn't for that fact, I would probably rate 'The Danish Girl' a 4. But since it was actually nominated, it amounts to an insult of the LGBT community by an Academy consisting predominantly of white males in their 50s (there are also zero black nominees this year by the way). Some people seem to believe that any LGBT-themed movie is a good thing, even if it's as shallow as this one. But I see this kind of 'made for straight audiences award grabber' as ignorant of the people it's supposed to be about - like 'Stonewall', which forged a historic event to exclude trans women and drag queens. 'The Danish Girl' is just as annoying and obsolete.",1,33,65,16 January 2016
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Not as bad and not as good as it could have been
","As the other reviews said, it's goofy as to be expected, half of the jokes don't land, it's twenty minutes too long. But it is also a film that the world needs right now. Americans regard Eurovision as a horrible trashfest of bad music, but they also envy us Europeans for it because it is a festival of unity in the face of all that divides us. That's what it's for, and that how it works. The film brings that across quite well, especially in the singalong scene with former contest participants.The best part are the 'you stupid Americans' jokes- it's funny because it's true! We really don't like you, and we slurp Starbucks cinnamon latte - very good roast! We are such hypocrites! Almost as much as you are! The puns on Russia are also pretty good. The worst part is Iceland. Iceland is not Ireland, so why are Brosnan and elves in it? I know it's just a one letter difference but be careful when you rip on us Europeans. Because now we can say, haha, those stupid Americans want to make fun of us, but they can't even get the island right :-)",7,3,9,27 June 2020
Pacific Rim," some anime tips for those of you who are not J-nerds
","A lot's been said, personally I felt PR to be the most entertaining summer film so far. It was definitely worth the 3D extra charge, and should definitely be seen in a theater - without a first-class sound system and on a smaller screen, there's not much point in watching this.Since PR is Hollywood's first deep dive into the mecha (fighting robot) world, those of you who are not too fascinated by things Japanese may not know where much of the inspiration for this came from. So here's a few anime tips in case you got curious. In a way, the B.O. indicates that this kind of thing may work better with audiences in the animated form.Everybody in the world should be familiar with Evangelion. Then again, the original is from 1995-96, so some younger folks may not be. The 'Eva' mecha are the obvious inspiration for the Jaeger's design. Three visually updated relaunch movies have been released: 'Evangelion 1.0. You are not alone' (2007), www.imdb.com/title/tt0923811, 'Evangelion 2.0. You can (not) advance' (2009), www.imdb.com/title/tt0860906, and 'Evangelion 3.0: You can (not) redo' (2012), www.imdb.com/title/tt0860907. The films are less philosophical than the original 26 episode series. For that reason, however, it's the perfect introduction to mecha anime for anyone who's enjoyed PR, but found the story too flat/silly.Similar mecha anime with better stories would be 'Aquarion' (2005, 26 episodes, same 'fusion of mecha pilots' angle), 'Broken Blade' (2010-11, 6 OVAs, fantasy mecha battle epic with the same melodrama), the highly recommended 'Code Geass' (2008/2012, 50 episodes, alternative evil empire history with super powers), 'Gargantia' (2013, 13 episodes, similar monsters), and 'Macross Frontier' (2008-09, 26 episodes, similar monsters with space opera and singing).If you're looking for an anime currently airing which best defines the difference between this entertainment form and film, has an interesting story and is recklessly cool, try 'Attack on Titan' (www.imdb.com/title/tt2560140). Be warned, you may be hooked and become a J-nerd yourself. But don't resist the fun, go with the zeitgeist.",8,5,9,28 July 2013
Warrior," well if this isn't the American Nightmare
","OK, actually this is a decent sports drama, and I would rate it 6.5-7 if it wasn't for an utterly horrifying plot element that seems to have escaped most people: The main hero of the story is forced into foreclosure of his home by an arrogant banker who weaseled him into his loan in the first place, and now refuses to extend it. His only way out is to participate in a no-holds-barred fight tournament organized and financed by - an arrogant Wall Street banker! Just how sick is that? The people who force ordinary Americans into bankruptcy get the additional kick of watching said Americans get their heads bashed in - and be grateful for the wads of cash they may receive if they make it. Exactly like 'Hunger Games', only there it's criticized and in a SciFi setting, whereas 'Warrior' glorifies this state of things and is set in the present day! Almost as if the US today were some sort of Ancient Rome, where the impoverished should be thankful for their chance to prove their merit in the arena like the gladiators of yore.Other reasons for me to dislike the film were various plot gaps wider than the Grand Canyon: if a soldier goes AWOL in Iraq - how can he resurface in the US under a different name? Are we supposed to believe that US immigration turns a blind eye on disgruntled young men? Besides the fact that the feat, for which he is so celebrated in the film, is physically impossible (body submerged in water = no leverage).Then there's the 'Rocky' thing: below-than-average fighter trains for a big tournament and makes it against all odds. In 'Rocky', however, the whole story is about getting there, how to overcome the shortcomings of the body by willpower, and the final fight is a draw, not a victory - because in that film, the emphasis is on keeping it real, and that's what makes it a classic. 'Warrior', however, features totally unbalanced fight sequences; the only difference to wrestling would be the missing name calling, and that it presents itself as a real deal, where in fact anybody who's ever done a bit of martial arts can only shake his head and go WTF.On the plus side, there's Nick Nolte's great presence in a, however, highly cliché role. But aforementioned plot element, which I perceive as an assault on common sense and civil rights, prompts me to condemn this film completely. If there's anyone in this film who'd deserve a good thrashing, it's the organizer of the Sparta tournament!",1,91,203,4 August 2012
The White Ribbon," simply put - the most boring and pointless film of the year
","'The White Ribbon' deals with Michael Haneke's household issues, loss of childhood innocence (for which the title is indeed a cipher), and unexplainable violence. The latter subject makes for much of the appeal of his earlier works like 'Benny's Video', which feature a rather uneventful plot turned upside down by a chain of unexplained and therefore intriguing events. 'The White Ribbon' follows this formula so closely that one may be excused of thinking of this film as some sort of remake in a different historical setting.The difference is that this time, the story leads absolutely nowhere, This again is some sort of fixture in Haneke's oeuvre, not finishing the story and just ending the movie like that. But while this worked quite well in 'Caché' because it left the viewer with a sentiment of foreboding, this time it's plainly annoying, probably just because of the fact that Haneke has done this so many times before.As for the acting, it is worthwhile to imagine how the intended performance of Ulrich Mühe (the Stasi official in 'The Life of Others') would have changed this film. Given his vocal intensity and talent to express a lot with little gestures, 'The White Ribbon' may have been a less drab, unexciting experience, but the script leaves little room for the cast to add something interesting to it.Still, 'The White Ribbon' won the Palme d'Or in Cannes this year plus the European Film Awards and the Golden Globe, which illustrates how prizes are won these days: a household name, an established routine, a carefully orchestrated press campaign alluding to the symbolic nature of the story, black and white for a notion of art, and nobody dares to say the film is dull. Yet that's what 'The White Ribbon' is - boring. The longest two and a half hours of your life expect you.A tip on the side: The Jury Prize in Cannes this year went to Jacques Audiard's 'A Prophet', which is a good juxtaposition to this film: it also follows a formula, but with much more zest and brilliant acting.",1,37,96,30 December 2009
Inside Out," 8.4 for shallow techno new age gibberish going nowhere?
","A young girl's five emotions try to solve her identity crisis caused by moving, but when the wrong levers in brain's control center are pushed, things go awry. That synopsis made me push watching this further and further ahead to, but I loved Docter's masterpiece 'Up' so I had to watch this in a theater while I still could. Me and my partner thought, well, not really expecting much, so it will probably be OK. But oh what a disappointment it was. OK, I admit we are not teens. And love Japanese animation. And I do not appreciate Disney because of their marketing bonanza and ill-fitting gender stereotypes. But this film is so chock-full of fantasy-killing and misguided ideological messages that I am flabbergasted. It is beyond me how so little viewers find offense with the messages, and that these are thoroughly inappropriate for kids. Like for instance: 1) You are not in control of your emotions, your emotions control you. 2) Thought and reason have no influence at all on your decisions. 3) If you do not keep your emotions in check, you will lose your memories. If you lose your memories, you will become emotionally unresponsive. 4) There is only one good emotion (joy). There are four negative ones (sadness, anger, disgust, fear). That is it. That is what everyone feels. To hell with love. Or desire. Or curiosity. Or faith. 5) In order to grow up, your joyful memories have to become sad memories. Why? Good question. That is the climax of the movie and there is no explanation why this should be the case.None of this makes any sense. The whole plot is completely incoherent. These messages hold no educational value whatsoever. And strangely this seems to be more obvious to children than to adults - I heard a boy asking his parents what any of that was supposed to mean. This is obviously made and marketed for tech-savvy young parents who think they should take their kids to something more 'challenging' than 'Planes 2'. The parents look like what an ad exec at Disney imagines Google employees to look like - mom wears cute specs, dad a hipster beard and it is set in San Francisco on top of that. The whole thing is probably the most in-your-face marketing device posing for a movie that I have ever seen. And everybody seems to be literally buying it.Well, not everybody. Some of the reviewers here do have similar issues, so all is not lost for the human race. If you care for an alternative story about a girl away from home struggling to adapt, there is the fantastic new Ghibli feature 'When Marnie was there'. That film has everything 'Inside Out' has not: a story, believable characters, imagination, mystery, and most importantly: heart.",2,200,432,26 October 2015
The Lives of Others," overrated artificial kitsch, I'm sorry to say
","I must say that ever since watching this picture I felt that it was grossly overrated, mainly because of its artistic limitations and because I felt that it does no justice to its hype.While the Stasi investigation methods portrayed here are definitely correct and meticulously researched by the director for a period of (reportedly) 1.5 years, the characters come across as extremely shallow. It looks as if the director/script writer first picked up a certain Stasi lingo/ investigatory framework and then built his film around that, rather than working from existing characters. That gives the story a decidedly artificial feel.Therefore none of the figures really convinced me, safe Ulrich Mühe's lead of course. Yet this Swan-Lake-like performance of a brilliant actor who already knew that he was terminally ill at the time of the shoot may raise this film out of the realm of the ordinary, but it still has all the makings of a sophisticated TV movie rather than a theatrical release. Also, as someone who grew up (in part) in East Germany, I must say that the portrayal of a state-endorsed writer appears to be intolerably naive, and that in order to achieve such a rank, it would have been quite necessary to sell out on your colleagues way before this painful choice presents itself in the movie. And, pardon me, but Sebastian Koch is a TV actor, and a pretty bad one at that.Worst of all, the sappy soundtrack by otherwise fondly remembered Gabriel Yared transforms the already debatable historical drama into mere kitsch - the music feels like glue at times. It would seem that it was precisely this kitsch-cliché aspect which made this film such a success with American critics and aged intellectuals, but for German audiences (at least me and my friends) it added to a calculated shallowness that may serve to win an Academy Award, but doesn't really do justice to its subject. The director's follow-up 'The Tourist' has been rightfully criticized for pretty much the same reasons given here, so hopefully the undue support for this film will be reconsidered.",4,24,55,26 December 2008
Call Me by Your Name," Some clarity (perhaps) from a gay guy who grew up in the 80s...
","I've just seen this for the 2nd time after a festival screening last year where everybody loved it. In this screening and in the reviews here, there's a lot of division, so maybe I can add a few things to help some younger, straighter people out there to know what to expect.It's a novel adaptation from someone who grew up at the same time I did, and I can confirm that this kind of story is what we fantasized about back in 1983 - from the younger guys´ perspective. This is very much a gay fantasy, but unlike 'Moonlight', it isn't bent to straight expectations - if you ask gay friends what they thought about 'Moonlight', they'll very likely tell you it's utterly unrealistic, if you ask them about this, they'll very likely tell you that they wish it was true. A gay teenager in the 80s usually wasn't fantasizing about other teenage boys, because we considered them too immature, and because it was still quite dangerous to test the waters at school. The consequences could range from assault to social death. So we often had this ideal of a sophisticated 25-30ish guy like Oliver as a first romance, especially since 'Greek Love', which the film alludes to with the statues, was pretty much the only positive identifier for homosexuality available at the time. There was no internet, there were no films, porn and bars were yet out of reach. So the people here who think this has a pedo touch to it are totally off, it's the other way around. But I give it 9 instead of 10 because the age difference in the book is narrower. For younger people, the pace must be painfully slow - that's definitely the most courageous aspect of the film, it replicates the narrative structure of the book and allows its story to breathe and slowly grow on you. Many get that, there's no need to point this out expressly, but this is a very realistic approach to first love, for a long time nothing happens and then - boom. This is the reason why I cherish this film, it can make straight viewers understand that we're really not different in our feelings and choices, and that love is love, as Stuhlbarg says in his monologue - which could come across really awkward from a lesser actor.It's also realistic that Elio experiments with the other sex, most of us did, and as with the girl in the film that usually ended up OK, there were no hard feelings. In that respect, the 80s were probably a better time, interchanges among the sexes were really less forward, more playful, people judged you less harshly for what you were and looked like, the film brings that across really well. It strikes a perfect balance between capturing what the 80s were like for teens, a period of aimless waiting just like the summer, and a nostalgic fantasy of bygone days and a romance that never was. But it's not for everyone. Stay clear of this if your favorite film is 'Justice League'. No judgment, it's just not for you, wait a few years. And it's sometimes too subtle for its own good: many people will wonder why Elio is OK with Oliver's decision in the end, and why their story is so definitely over. Well, think about what the Star of David means, and of that scene with the grandma giving the guys water, and then they notice a portrait of the Duce... I only noticed that on my 2nd viewing, so I recommend watching it more than once to catch on to these drifts.",9,8,20,1 March 2018
Ex Machina," You know how it ends before you even start watching
","I believe in democracy. It's the only failure that works. It makes you understand that one's own opinion is not a cornerstone of this world. Not that it's not worth having one, of course. But it's important to be humbled by the reality of things every once in a while. So one cannot really complain about this film being seriously overrated. So let's focus on the facts.This is a film involving 4 characters in 1 research facility that also functions as living quarters (does this sound familiar yet?). It's about determining whether 1 of these is an actual living being (doesn't this sound familiar yet?). It contains prolonged Q&A's about the nature of intelligence vs. adaptability as a feature of life (really, that doesn't sound familiar yet?).It's perfectly alright to be a Sci-Fi fan and not to have watched any movies from before ten years ago. It's weird but OK. Still it strikes me as odd when Sci-Fi fans can't place the name Stanislaw Lem. Or when film buffs don't know who Tarkovsky was. And don't recognize the ?th remake/rip-off of 'Solaris' when they see it. Not even when it's this visually close to the George Clooney remake of 2002. It would be perfectly enough for me if more reviewers and voters for this thing expressed some bewilderment as to how predictable this movie is.So I guess many people like to watch films which end precisely the way they expect them to end, and rehash old classic novels and films without a shred of originality. I'm just not one of them. But I believe in democracy - in time, the rating of this piece will be more in line with its mediocrity.",5,5,12,25 May 2015
Inception," Shutter Island II, in a way - and a bit too much bang for my money
","OK, there are many raves as to how original 'Inception' is, and it's definitely to be welcomed that a film which works with so many layers should be such a success. And it's more entertaining than 'Prince of Persia', for sure. My fun was spoiled, however, by two factors.One, DiCaprio's role is so similar to the character he played in 'Shutter Island' that, if you know the film, you may get a good idea what's going on before the main plot has even started rolling. That could have been avoided by not using the same metaphors for remembrance (the children, the wife), but I guess it's just a coincidence. My boyfriend, with whom I've seen this and who hasn't seen 'Shutter Island', took some more time to figure out the plot, so I guess it does make a difference if you know that film or not.Two, there's too much kaboom in 'Inception' for filler, as in most of Nolan's other films since 'Memento'. That may be just me getting old, but when a film at first tries to intrigue me with a multi-layered concept, and then bangs away both visually and soundtrack-wise to distort your attention from any plot holes there may be, it's a bit of a let-down. 'Matrix' (well, the first one) worked with its own incoherences, and it still stands as a standard of the genre; I doubt that 'Inception' may, as time passes, outrank it, because repeat viewings of stretched-out gunfire and bomb blasts tend to equal each other in retrospect; it's the engaging moments that create a masterpiece - like Morpheus' breaking of the chains in 'Matrix', or Rutger Hauer's comment that memories vanish 'like tears in rain' in 'Blade Runner'. All the interesting metaphysical talk in 'Inception', as intriguing as it may be, cannot take root in my mind, as there's no character, no emotion, no pain to connect it to.Still, this is an entertaining way to spend an evening to be sure. Just don't expect a life-changing epiphany of sorts, as has been suggested elsewhere.",7,4,8,28 July 2010
The Big Short," Tells people what they want to hear but in a well done way
","One has to hand it to 'The Big Short' that it tries to package the financial crisis in terms that most people can understand. It successfully re-creates a variety of real-life characters who saw the sub-prime crisis coming, profited from it - and felt bad about profiting from it. Its strength is that it is very driven about its subject matter. Its weakness is that it takes an ethical stance that doesn't allow viewers to truly reflect on what they're seeing. The brilliant 'Margin Call' was all about the atmosphere of the crash. It didn't try to explain it all, it dwelt in the moment, and is therefore still the defining film on the subject. This film is about putting the blame solidly on the side of the banks. And it does so in sometimes annoyingly over-acting their ignorance and greed.However, everyone was and is greedy. The characters shorting the markets didn't do so just because they wanted to teach the banks a lesson. They did so primarily because it was an opportunity. A stripper who obtains five homes and a condo through sub-prime mortgages on speculation to resell them at a higher price is just a source of information here. But in fact, characters like hers were just as responsible for the crisis as the banks who were selling those loans. That aspect is completely lost in this film. If you take a 5% interest loan to buy stocks, can you really blame the bank if you don't make 5% returns? I'd love to see a film that calls for people to act responsibly in what they're doing financially. Without greedy borrowers, there could be no greedy lenders.From an investors' perspective, neither the book nor the film tell anything that was not previously known. One would presume that a crisis which cost virtually everyone money would be familiar to the general public to such an extent as to render lengthy explanations about what CDOs are obsolete. My biggest take-away from 'The Big Short' is that, apparently, it strikes a lot of people as ingenious when synthetic CDOs are explained by Selena Gomez at a black jack table. Most Americans are involved in the financial markets through their pensions, loans, insurances, properties and stocks, so this 'making it easy' should feel somewhat insulting to them. But it seems the author and film maker were right on the mark with that approach, and THAT is the worrying message to me - everyone is STILL in the haze and needs that kind of schooling.'The Big Short' is not a masterpiece, but the effectiveness of its storytelling makes it probably the most important film among this year's Oscar contenders.",7,0,2,16 January 2016
Son of Saul," In spite of all the awards, this is Holocaust porn
","So this won the Cannes Grand Prix and the Golden Globe and Oscar for foreign film. So this must be a truly excellent film, especially since so many people here seem to be of that opinion, right? I admit: technically, this is a new approach to the theme, in which the face of the protagonist reflects all what is happening around him, and in which an excellent, well-thought sound design carries over the horrors that remain at the edges of the frame. And yet, I'm one of the handful of reviewers who are rather disappointed.I admit this is because of my partial Romani heritage. At this point, especially with what's been going on in Europe (and particularly Hungary) over the past years, a film that manages to give passing reference to gay and Soviet Auschwitz inmates - and STILL ignores the presence of Sinti and Roma - isn't just unconsciously overseeing the issue. Romani organizations weren't happy with 'Schindler's List' back in the day, pointing out that the realistic approach Spielberg chose eradicated an essential part of Romani history. I thought that critique too harsh - 'Schindler's List' is a masterpiece of storytelling and it would not have been part of the story to include references to Birkenau II. This film, however, could have easily avoided this negligence, and if you find it hard to understand why anyone should be mad about that, I suggest you watch another Hungarian film, 'Just the Wind' (2012). That one gives you an idea of the perpetual hell of Romani existence.Yet like a number of German critics also pointed out, what really gives me the creeps about 'Son of Saul' is the frame composition, with ample use of naked bodies out of focus, and an extensive use of nudity as a symbol of helplessness. I cannot help but agree that this constitutes Holocaust pornography. The images are carefully constructed to elicit shock, yet do not contribute to the story - as was the case in 'Schindler's List'. The film is carried by the structural idea, which is not at all an original one, but reminiscent of classic Hungarian cinema - particularly 'Red Psalm' (1972) by Miklós Jancsó and the work of Béla Tarr, whom this director assisted.The story, simple as it is, is in fact unrealistic if you go by the memoirs of Roman Frister or Lucie Adelsberger (to name just a few) since there was no freedom of movement corresponding to what you see in this film. The pointlessness of the protagonist's actions, clear to all around him as well as himself, also run contrary to what I've read from survivors, who very clearly describe what animated them and what the dynamics within the inmates were. So if you've not read any books and haven't watched any testimonials or documentaries, I'm afraid this film can easily misguide your perceptions of what the Holocaust was, and deliver and imprint so strong that it may be hard to challenge by more factual depictions. Yet this is of course an extremely important work in the negative sense, in that it shows just how easily content can be styled to elicit a specific response and garner an avalanche of awards.Perhaps my judgment would not be this harsh if this wouldn't ring so close, and if Hungary wouldn't have the human rights record it has under Orbán. But considering the film culminates in an uprising - if you've devoted some time to the study of Auschwitz, you may understand why I cannot help but wonder when, finally, will there be a film about May 16th, 1944 in Birkenau II. It's very much needed, and the story is so powerful that it wouldn't require as much technical finesse.",5,8,14,15 December 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," In brief: same old, but who cares?
","Let me keep this to the essentials.Is it worth seeing? Yes.Will it change your life? No.Is it better than Eps I-III? Yes.Is it better than Eps IV-VI? No.What's particularly awesome? Han Solo, super fast pace, retro chic, sound effects.What's particularly lame? Kylo Ren, British accents galore, lazy story, too much deja-vu.Totally worth the ticket and tons of fun if you don't expect the time of your life.",7,7,21,17 December 2015
Cloud Atlas," Epic bonus, but something's missing...
","I love epics, but they can be a drag - if you have to wait too long for the resolution of a story you can make a good guess at, the pleasure of watching a well developed story can turn to pain. 'Cloud Atlas', however, never runs into this dilemma because it presents six movies bundled up into one, set in time-lines from 1849 until a dystopian future. What could have been confusing is held together quite nicely by the overlaying theme of reincarnation and - perhaps more importantly - purpose: no individual effort, as hopeless as it may seem, is ever in vain, as it transcends the time to influence the actions and feelings of others, like music does (the title-giving 'Cloud Atlas' sextet).The way the stories are edited to meander into another is definitely the most interesting aspect of this largely German production - it's kind of rewarding to see about a hundred million of our tax dollars spent on an honest artistic effort, rather than the bottomless pit formerly known as Greece. And still, notwithstanding the great ensemble acting, some of the stories work better than others, which suffer from a bit of oversimplification and predictability. Top of my pick would be the present-day set retirement home escape plot featuring a brilliant Jim Broadbent, because it's keeping to the essentials and still features quite a few surprises. The Hawaii-set post-apocalyptic bit is also impressive due to a somewhat logical (if from my perspective pessimistic) conclusion. And this story also features Hugo Weaving's best part.Less convincing to me, however, was the futuristic part; the replicant, pardon, fabricant played by Doona Bae - who does a great job reminiscent of her part in 'Air Doll' - too strongly recalls 'Blade Runner' topics without devoting sufficient character development time. And the look is way too similar to 'Matrix' - the Wachowskis would have been better advised to go for an unestablished style, because this way, you can't help trying to associate the story with 'Matrix', since you're visually coerced to do so. And because of this, the 'Messiah' aspect of the story feels overplayed and out of sync with the more lyrical parts of the movie. The composer bit set in 1931 also felt a little shallow, kind of like 'Let's add a bit of Merchant-Ivory E.M. Forster flair here for contrast'. Too much focus on style, not enough focus on acting credibility, as is mostly the case in Tykwer's international oeuvre. But all in all, it's definitely one of the more intelligent and yet entertaining outings this year: It's never boring, and it's never dumb. It's just not quite a masterpiece. As far as anti-progress stories are concerned - and you'll notice that all six stories in 'Cloud Atlas' are in some respect anti-progress -, nothing beats Mel Gibson's 'Apocalypto' in my opinion. As far as time jumps are concerned, 'Mr. Nobody' by Jaco Van Dormael is far more elegant - a must watch if you liked this film. And as far as opulent visual style is concerned, 'The Fall' by Tarsem is far superior. Still, watch it on the big screen while you can, because epics are rare cinematic pleasures these days, and usually the German Film Fund doesn't have this kind of money.",8,0,3,1 December 2012
In the Land of Blood and Honey," Much ado about nothing, or some better films about war
","This has to be the first time that I see a film just because of the controversy it has incited here on IMDb... and, well, having seen it, I'm wondering: What is all the commotion about? This has all the faults one could expect from an outsider's view. I understand how annoying this must be, but in all its naivety, I find 'In the Land of Blood and Honey' rather too insubstantial to merit concern. After all, there are lots of films from ex-Yugoslavia which deal with the war in a more sophisticated way and have a lot more punch...'Grbavica' AKA 'Esma's Secret' (2006) dealt with the topic of war rape in a sensitive, understandable and yet unsettling way - and it didn't even pass a blame, it just described a woman's specific story. Jolie's mistake is to try to show rape in all of its brutality, which is highly disrespectful of women who have undergone such a trauma. A more skilled director would have avoided to show the actual fact and leave it to the viewer's imagination - the barrel of a gun is more menacing to see than the bullet in the head.'Cabaret Balkan' (1998) was a random sequence of episodes happening during one night in Belgrade, with the war never being shown but in a constant, overshadowing presence affecting the lives of all characters. With the stories being so short, the characters' problems had to be interpreted by the viewer. The result was emotional confusion and the realization that there is much to the war that outsiders cannot understand. Jolie's mistake is to focus on one story between two characters, which allows the viewer to find them more and more unconvincing, and dismiss the story.'Pretty Village Pretty Flame' (1996) dealt with the madness of war between brothers on the terrain of their childhood, and managed to portray all sides in equally disturbing characters. While made in Yugoslavia, it didn't take a one-sided jab at the other war party. Right until the infernal finale, everyone - including a Western journalist - gets to share the blame. Jolie's mistake is to take sides in an ongoing conflict where reconciliation is essential. It's like making a film about the West Bank in which all Israeli soldiers are ruthless killers, or all Palestinians terrorists in disguise. It adds oil to a fire which needs to be extinguished.'Incendies' (2010) dealt with the personal aftermath of civil war in the guise of a highly stylized personal tale - while avoiding to mention that the country in question was Lebanon. It's a masterpiece because when you watch it, you don't think about war, you think about the leading woman's story, which is so terrible that it gives you a much better understanding of the terror of war than the sight of pillaging and bloodshed. Jolie's mistake was to choose the specific setting of the Yugoslavia war, instead of keeping the location open. She should have shot this with English actors, dealing with a conflict in an imaginary country. That would have been less offensive, and the numerous historical inaccuracies would not have mattered that way.Still, I cannot dismiss this film completely even though it's a failure in many ways. For any movie which inspires so much ire, and therefore prompts so much discussion, achieves its goal by a different path. In a way, it's a good thing that 'In the Land of Blood and Honey' is so bad, because you have to think about WHY it is so bad. And, who knows, maybe it's all intentional, and Jolie in some crazy, artistically suicidal way never intended to pull off a masterpiece, but to have her efforts ripped to pieces as it has indeed been done.",5,3,15,5 September 2012
