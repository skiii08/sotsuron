Scarface," My favorite movie so far
","Perfect from the beginning to an end! Unlike The Godfather (which without a doubt is a great trilogy), it's not boring even for a minute. Tony's way from the bottom to the top is rapid and exciting, without boring talks here and then. Al Pacino did an excellent job portraying his character.
Definitely a must watch, if you haven't seen it yet :) - but it does get brutal at some moments, so it's not for everyone.",10,0,1,21 June 2019
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Great movie. Very different from others.
","I personally loved this film. Yes, it was a little long (2 hrs. 40 min.), but it didn't bore me even for a minute. The movie beautifully depicts how a short time happiness can be worth the whole life. It shows the life and death in a very different way and makes you ponder about the fact, that everything we hold dear, everything we love, will eventually disappear, and that the we have to get over it - simply to let it go.Through Benjamin's eyes we can see different angles of people's lifes and get a picture of it. The house of the elderly - their last moments, their wisdom and their weak moments, when they become like children again (with Alzheimer and other diseases). The sailor's life on the sea, their adventures, struggles, the enjoyment they pursue - brothels and alcohol. The life of young talented dancer, who dedicates her whole life to it and yet, gets into an accident after which her career ends. The life of a young couple in love, who unfortunately know they don't have much time together. And finally, the sacrifice which Benjamin makes for his love and his daughter, so that they can live happily, even if he doesn't. And of course, the love of Daisy towards Benjamin - when she takes care of him in his outmost difficulty.This movie makes you understand, that all of us are pursuing the same end, yet in a very different way. Nothing lasts forever, and you have to simply live the moment. Fully enjoy the little good time you have.To whom didn't see this masterpiece, I strongly recommend to do so. But prepare that not much action actually happens, it is the simple things of an extraordinary life, directed and portrayed perfectly - the reflex of real life, just backwards :)",9,0,0,25 July 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," One of the greatest movies of all times
","'Some birds are not meant to be caged, that's all. Their feathers are too bright, their songs too sweet and wild'A phrase that I memorized and even used couple of times in my life, after hearind it :DWithout much talking, do watch it if you haven't seen it yet.",10,0,1,21 June 2019
