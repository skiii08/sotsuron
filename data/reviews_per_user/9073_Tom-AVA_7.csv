Lucky Number Slevin," One of the best films i've seen recently
","OK, so it is the summer of 2007, as a movie lover you would expect me to be at the cinema watching one of this years summer blockbusters that people have been going on about for a fair amount of time. However, aside from the fact that I've already seen all this years summer blockbusters (excluding Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix which isn't yet out), you have to realise that this summers films haven't quite been as good as we expected.So this evening, i sat down, turned of Sky Movies Premiere and watched Lucky Number Slevin. I'll be honest, i really thought this film was gunna be bad, which was the main reason i hadn't bought this film on DVD or even watched it in the cinema last year. But for the first time this summer i was truly blown away by a film, and this one wasn't even a summer blockbuster.This film us truly phenomenal. Its pacing is fairly quick and it always keeps you interested. The characters are all brilliantly played, especially Slevin by Josh Hartnett. He is a truly great character and really well acted. His small, one liners will really make you laugh, but when you see him being a lil' bit serious, he is serious. The story of this film takes many twists and turns and through the whole film you will sit there trying to think of what could happen next and what he twists are going to be. The killings are brilliantly done, perhaps even Tarintino-esquire.I highly recommend that this summer, if your bored of the rubbish summer blockbusters and you haven't seen this film before, maybe you should, cos its just brilliant and one of the best films i have seen in a long time.",10,6,12,23 June 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Unmissable!
","I loved the origonal Pirates of the Caribbean, it was brilliant and i watched it over and over again. I then waited 2/3 years for the second one. When it finally came out i went to see it as soon as i could and i can honestly sat that it truly lived up to the hype..... and then some.The plot is sort of confusing, i got mixed up with who wanted the treasure for different reasons, but that might be because i went to the toilet half way through. So Jack is now captain of the Black Pearl and he does all these mental quests in between the first and second film that don't really bring back any proper treasure. But they do in fact add up to finding Davey Jones' heart, which Jack needs because he promised Davey Jones his soul but Jack doesn't want to pay up. Meanwhile, Elizabeth ( who looks absolutely stunning in the film) and Will are supposed to be getting married but they get arrested by this guy because they helped Jack escape. So Will has a deal with this guy and agrees to get Davey Jones' heart for him so he can control the sea and so Will and Elizabeth can be free.The plot is as i said, very complicated, but very absorbing. The film also delves right into it so that we don't have to sit through 15-20 minutes of explanation about the first film. The character development is brilliant and we some interesting changes in some characters. Johnny Depp is absolutely amazing as Jack, he keeps you on the edge of the seat with the amazing action and makes you laugh until your sides hurt. Kiera Knightley is fantastic as Elizabeth and shows how ruthless she can be. Orlando is brilliant as Will and gives a great performance.If you liked the first film then you will really really enjoy this one. The 2 and 1/2 hours seems to fly by and the film leaves you on a huge cliffhanger and makes you feel really bad that you are going to have to wait a year to see the next one. This one is probably my second favourite of all the summer blockbusters and is one that you really cannot miss.",10,2,5,27 July 2006
Spider-Man 2," The greatest film I have ever seen!
","I watched this film on the opening weekend as i always do with Marvel comics films. I had to go in with high expectations, especially after the first Spiderman film. I mean, you couldn't not like it.I came out of the film with a massive grin on my face, and i knew that i had witnessed the best comic book adaption ever. This film had it all, incredible acting, incredible special effects and an enticing storyline. Each character played the part to perfection, and Alfred Molina was incredible as Doc Ock, who was one of my favourite villains in the comic books. Harry, Mary Jane, Aunt May and J-Jona Jameson were all fantastic in their big or small roles. And of course Tobey Mcguire was sensational as Peter Parker/Spiderman. You could feel every bit of emotion he was going through, and yet when it switched to the action, he was just as amazing.I challenge you to watch the film and not like it. It is impossible not to like it. And anyone who says its not good doesn't know anything about films.",10,0,1,7 July 2006
Spider-Man 3," Is it good??
","On so many levels could this film have gone wrong. The 3 villains in it could have confused the storyline, they could have got caught up with the special effects and just made it a showcase of that. They could have crushed everything that was built up over the last two films. But they didn't!No, they didn't forget the formula that made the last films so great. They didn't forget the balance of the love story and drama in the films with the action scenes and the special effects. They didn't forget all the reasons why we loved Spiderman 1 and 2 and that for me is why this film is so great. I have to tell you that it all worked perfectly. The 3 story lines worked around each other and you never got lost and then all came together for one amazing finale. The characters were all awesome. Each one played their part so well, it was like finally seeing a comic book on the screen the way it should be done. Kirsten Dunst was amazing, as always. Topher Grace was a brilliant Venom/ Eddie Brock, Thomas Haden Church was brilliant as Sandman/ Flint Marko and James Franco was just great as Green Goblin MK2/ Harry Osbourne. And then there is Tobey McGuire as Spiderman/Peter Parker. What can i say. It was a genius performance. This was he Peter Parker from the comics, this was the Spideman from the comics. He was a character you could understand what he was going through, understand everything that happened to him, you went on his remarkable journey with him. There were just so many small bits in this film that all came together and that really made it brilliant. However, in spite of what i said above, this film does have its flaws, and some major ones at that. The script isn't all that great but there are some good moments in there. There are some scenes where you wonder, why the hell did they put that in there/ why didn't they do that in the last movie? Some of the dialogue between characters can be just shocking, but hey, its a comic book movie. But one of my major problems with the movie was that fact the this film was way over-hyped and so people expected a lot more than they got, and this is the reason for all those idiots out there saying that this film is either too dark or too cheesy (please make up your minds which one it is because it cant be both).But do you know what, in the end none of this matters because it really is a great film, with some classic scenes. Sure its not as good as Spiderman 2, but that was a difficult act to follow. When you see this film, just sit and enjoy it for what it is. This film will make you laugh, it might even make you cry, but i promise it will have you on the edge of your seat.So don't listen to all the stupid Spideman fan-boys, don't listen to the critics, go and see this movie for yourself, make your own opinion on it.",10,5,9,4 May 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Its really good..... just needs a directors cut!!
","I was really excited and pumped up about going to see this movie as i loved the other two films. I finally managed to get to my local cinema to see it and i watched in awe.My first thought was, what the hell have they done. Then i began to ponder on it, i began to think of the jaw dropping special effects and the spectacular acting. The story was excellent and 36 hours after seeing the film, i eventually had my true thoughts on it.It is fantastic film to watch and you can truly feel the emotion of the characters. Hugh Jackman is legendary in this film and the only man who could have played Wolverine like he did. Ian Mckellan is, as usual, perfect. He does wonderful work as magneto. The rest of the cast is brilliant.HOWEVER!!!!!The movie just did not have the X-factor that the last film had. It did not retain the awesome action, or the perfect running time. Which brings me onto my next point. The film could have had another half an hour in it, at the very least. In fact you could have stretched that storyline on for another hour. That is what bothered me the most, the fact that it was so short..... and it could have been longer. I am now pleading Brett Rattner to please please please make a directors cut on DVD. I am sure that lots of people would buy it.So once again, a fantastic film, it just should have been longer. I came out thinking i was robbed of half an hours worth of film and with a horrible feeling in my stomach.",7,0,1,7 July 2006
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," The Summer is Saved
","Thank you 20th Century Fox and Marvel, you have saved the summer for me. So we kicked off the summer with Spiderman 3 which was one of the most anticipated movies in history, and it was such a let-down. Next to take the plunge was Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, which i just couldn't sit through. And in quick succession was Shrek The Third and Oceans 13. Now while Oceans 13 wasn't all bad, Shrek The Third was just not great. So as i walked into the cinema today with all my friends i was hoping and praying that Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer could save the summer from all these huge let-downs. Walking out of the cinema i felt very elated, because this film is phenomenal. It wasn't too long, the story wasn't too complicated, the characters were all brilliantly played, the action was awesome, the special effects were great as well, the list just goes on. However there was one thing that made this movie so great, and that was the fact that it felt like a summer blockbuster. I was sat in the cinema thinking to myself, this exactly what it was meant to be like watching Pirates of the Caribbean and Shrek and that makes this film the bar for this summer. So lets all thank the Fantastic Four and the Silver Surfer for saving the summer for finally entertaining us and giving us something that was worth going to the cinema for.",10,20,41,16 June 2007
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Utterly fantastic!!
","First off, i am a huge Harry Potter fan. I read the books constantly and i love watching the films, i am one of those strange Pottermaniacs. So this film was very important to me as it was one of my favourite books.I managed to persuade my mum to take me to the first showing of this on the release day. I booked the tickets several weeks and i then spent the rest of my time wondering what the film was gong to be like. From the moment the lights went down to the end credits, i was mesmerised.So the basic storyline is that Harry has to compete in a special tournament (The Triwizard tournament) when his name comes out of the Goblet of Fire, which is a big cup full of fire. The trouble is, Harry doesn't know who put is name in it, because he didn't. The tournament has three tasks which test the witches/wizards.The film has jaw-dropping special effects, the likes of which i have never seen before. The dragon in the first task is truly amazing. The book was done to great accuracy, but a lot of key moments were missed, the Quidditch world cup match wasn't shown which was a disappointment. Every scene that did appear though was very much to how i imagined it. The actors were all superb in their big or small roles, especially Brendan Gleeson as Moody.The film truly grabs your heart and your mind and takes you on a ride like no other Harry Potter film before it. It truly lived up to my expectations. However......there is one problem. The directors seem to be making the films at a length so that they are durable for smaller children. This can destroy the point of adaptions and ruin a franchise. The films need to be made longer, and if need be, split into two parts.But don't let that ruin this completely spellbinding film, because it is fantastic and that is coming from a true Harry Potter fan. You really must see this one.",10,1,2,16 July 2006
