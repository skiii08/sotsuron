Minority Report," The most insultingly stupid blockbuster ever.
","SPOILERS INCLUDED.It's hardly a revelation that Hollywood's been dumbing down practically since movies were invented, but the sheer verve in putting out a movie as mindwrenchingly stupid as this has to be applauded.Sure, anything involving seeing into the future is a plot minefield, but when even the most basic premise of the film is an impossible paradox (the only reason the murder happens at all is that it is foreseen, because that's what causes Cruise to go off looking for the guy, except how can it have been foreseen, when it wasn't going to happen *unless it was foreseen*?)But even if you bend over backwards and try to forget that such a piece of idiocy is the central plot of the film, the movie treats its audience with such staggering contempt that it's a wonder Spielberg didn't actually come and take a dump in everyone's popcorn personally.Example #1 of 654,399 - Cruise sees himself commit a murder. He knows it will take place in 36 hours. Does he (a) lock himself in a room for the next 37 hours, hence ensuring the murder does not take place and solving the entire problem? Or (b) Run off on a ludicrous two-hour chase sequence, whose sole purpose is to place himself in the murder location with a loaded gun?Take your time.And the feelgood ending? One man pays the price for a crime, though that crime saved the lives of thousands of innocents, and though his paying the price can't bring back the victim. The result, however, is that thousands of killers are released onto the streets, and an infallible murder-prevention program is ended, doubtless leading to the deaths of thousands more innocents. Great.Anyone who voted this more than 1/10 must surely still be getting their dinner spoonfed to them out of a little jar. If you tolerate something this idiotic, and it seems that most people do, you have no right to ever complain about dumbing-down again.",Null,0,0,29 June 2003
