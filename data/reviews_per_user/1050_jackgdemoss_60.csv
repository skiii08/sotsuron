The Rock," Michael Bay has controlled the space to the point that his old films look cliche
","My movie bucket list gift continues to expose my intrinsic negative bias towards old movies! It is clear to me that The Rock was wildly entertaining upon its release. Audiences must have been captivated by its shot changes every 1-4 seconds, its magnificent vehicle explosions, and its big name actors. But viewing it in today's light exposes it as such a meme. Perhaps it is the fault of Nic Cage, because everything he has touched has been memeifyed. Perhaps it is the fault of Michael Bay, for being so revolutionary in the space that enough copy cats emerged to make your original product look cliche. Whatever it is, watching The Rock in 2020 is like watching the most basic action/adventure imaginable, with the exception of the magnificent shower scene.",6,1,3,12 January 2020
Ford v Ferrari," Bale is superb, but the content wasn't for me
","Going in, I knew this film had no shot of being a 10/10 for me. I am about as far from a gearhead or racing fan as one can be. With that being said, I was still intrigued throughout the entire 2.5 hour run time. Christian Bale dominated the screen with his performance. I expect great things from him, but he really did outdo himself by portraying the oddities and ego of his character. If you are a fan of cars or racing, I imagine you will love Ford v Ferrari.",7,13,26,12 December 2019
Hereditary," Not a film for the faint of heart
","The horror genre is moving in the right direction, with films like Get Out, It, and A Quiet Place doing so well. I'm happy to see that many studios are taking note of this and breaking away from the cookie cutter horror formula, and taking risks. In Hereditary, the risk was in making your audience truly disturbed. If anyone went into that movie expecting the classic suspense to jump scare combo, they left completely shook and distrusting of any future horror films. Hereditary kept me guessing between two possible outcomes the entire time. Truly horrifying.",8,3,7,19 June 2018
A Star Is Born," A powerful retelling of a classic story
","Cinema can serve so many purposes. It can make the audience laugh or cry. It can bring people together with their family and friends. It can shed light on pertinent issues our society has faced or is currently facing. The central theme to all of these things is cinema's ability to make us feel. A Star is Born owned this, making me feel empty, fiery, uncomfortable, and even hopeful, all in its 2 hour run time. It tells a gripping story that is relatable to every person in one way or another. I highly recommend this classic story, as retold by Bradley Cooper.",9,3,6,24 February 2019
Unbreakable," A boring but necessary predecessor to Glass
","Split (2016) and Unbreakable are the two films that come before Glass (2019). Split is currently my 9th favorite film of all time, so naturally I am excited to see Glass. In this excitement, it seemed only fitting that I view Unbreakable so I can understand all of the plot elements at work. While I admit that it is likely necessary to view Unbreakable to fully enjoy Glass, it is a bit of a snooze fest. Aside from the classic M. Night ending, Unbreakable has nothing going for it and feels more like an average television episode of a low-budget crime thriller.",6,2,4,30 January 2019
Train to Busan," An engaging and suspensful zombie thriller
","Train to Busan is hard to put a pin in. Half of the time it plays like one of the most developed and enthralling zombie films to date, but the other half it plays like a B movie. Act I is rock solid through and through. The rules of the virus and the world it is in were laid on the line clear as day, following a respectable amount of time spent developing our main characters. The rest of the film is plagued by inconsistency with how the virus and the characters behave, which ultimately cripples the film. Even with this hindrance, Train to Busan is not an action film to miss.",8,3,6,9 June 2019
Captain Marvel," Put the pitchforks down. Brie Larson is sexist; Captain Marvel isn't.
","I love to tote my torch and pitchfork just as much as the next person, but I will always try to rate films in such a way that the reviews are written strictly about the film itself. Brie Larson may be sexist and racist, but Captain Marvel does not reflect those views and feels more empowering than anything.Many have criticized this film as complete garbage and many have sung it to be the best of Marvel. Both are far from the truth, and stem from the external drama surrounding the lead actress' bigoted statements. I am here to tell you that Captain Marvel is a good movie, and an average Marvel origin story. The visual effects were some of the best the studio has put together to date, which is saying a lot. There is an upbeat but ultimately forgettable score. Many of the supporting actors/actresses crush their roles, and the pacing was fair for how much information they were trying to get across. My primary gripes with the film were two fold: its lack of characterization of Captain Marvel which led to me feeling unattached to the character, and her disproportionate power level in comparison to the rest of the heroes in the universe. The latter would not be a big deal if I was not so invested in the story that Marvel Studios is telling with Thanos. This is a non issue until Avengers: End Game releases, however. Ultimately, Captain Marvel is worth your money if you have already seen Alita: Battle Angel this month. Check it out.",7,4,16,13 March 2019
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," 10 Years Later, Jason Segels comedy strikes hot
","It is a travesty that I allowed this movie to simmer 10 years without sitting down to enjoy it. Being a huge How I Met Your Mother fan, and more specifically a Jason Segel fan, this was a treat. Segel's awkward charm is perfect for the narrative, and I hope another film finds space for a character like that sometime soon, though I doubt it.",8,16,23,13 July 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A well-acted classic
","The two absolute stand-outs about the show are the score and Jack Sparrow. Firstly, the score is all it is hyped up to be. I had never seen the Pirates movies before but the second that thrilling piece started pumping during the first sword fight scene, I felt that I had known it forever. The music makes you want to rush into battle with the characters just to cheer them on. At the end of the day, what really carries this film to the heights it reached is Jack Sparrow. The combination of some of the best make-up/costume design ever done and top tier acting makes this character unforgettable.",9,1,1,16 April 2020
Us," Weak in comparison to Get Out, but a strong showing for new director Jordan Peele
","Jordan Peele is going to be the man to watch over the next 10 years. Few directors hurdle the sophomore slump as well as Peele does with Us. Although it can't hold a candle to his directorial debut, Get Out, it still packs quite the punch and is a thoroughly entertaining thriller. The societal message Peele tries to get across is not quite as clear cut as Get Out, where right off the bat there are small racial tensions that build onward. Us serves you the message frozen, and it takes a dialogue with a friend or reading a review for you to thaw it out properly. The film was rock solid in its pacing, building and breaking of expectations, and score. For those that are queasy with jump scares you can rest assured that Us doesn't rely too heavily on them.",8,4,11,22 March 2019
Knives Out," Mentally stimulating without throwing the audience way off the scent
","Daniel Craig leads an absolute rock-star cast in this classic who-done-it film. Nothing really makes Knives Out unique when compared to it's murder mystery peers, but it just performs so much better. This is attributed to it's solid pacing in the first 2 acts, it's phenomenal acting, and it's fairly cheery attitude. Knives Out is one that the whole family can follow and enjoy.",9,3,11,30 November 2019
The Irishman," Watch with an intermission
","3.5 hour runtime. Holy crap. I love that this film had enough to say that it needed that long, but by the end it felt like I was marathoning a TV show. This was compounded by the fact that it lacked any noticeable 3 act structure. Major downsides of The Irishman were its failure to fork some extra money over to CGI when it counted. I can remember a scene where a glass window breaks and it looked awful. Positives included a palpable sense of inclusion and family that comes with an Irishman being accepted into the ranks of the Italian mafia. We all long to see and feel this inclusion so it always seems to be an intrinsically good thing. Also, I appreciated the inclusion of that empty feeling elders must get when their stories and life tales fall on the deaf ears of youth. The theme of finality manifests as a cold and lonely finality for our main character.",8,5,8,15 December 2019
Aquaman," The DC universe is back!
","The DC universe has been doing pushups in the shadows while Marvel boasted in the spotlight. As a Marvel fanboy I am ecstatic to see that DC has officially entered the competition by coming out swinging with Aquaman. If you are skeptical as to whether or not you will like this film, please just watch the first few scenes. Aquaman maintains masterful storytelling and gripping action throughout the entirety of its 2.5-hour runtime, with the exception of the last 15 minutes. Cinematographer Don Burgess allowed the 160-million-dollar budget to work at its full potential, facilitating jaw-dropping fight scenes and making the audience feel the power behind the strikes. I have high hopes for quality DC films in the future!",9,3,5,25 December 2018
Deadpool 2," Ryan Reynolds reprises his role with a movie that does it right all across the board
","A sequel that surpasses the hit original, Deadpool 2 is laugh out loud funny the entire way through. The comedy is very similar to the first and is certainly not kid friendly. It is positively brutal in its action at times, with hysterical call backs and meta references. A must-see comedy.",9,3,4,19 June 2018
X-Men," It can't hold up to today's hero standards at all
","X-Men is the perfect example to showcase the gaping flaw in my reviews: older movies have a lower chance to be good, on average. Regardless about how much they progressed the industry or how new the concept was at the time, some older films have been severely outclassed by newer. X-Men was probably great in 2000. Superhero movies weren't dominating the screen, and some of the effects probably looked great. However, now that big budget hero flicks are the mainstay, X-Men looks like silly childs play. It doesn't hold up to today's standards, and whoever tells you it does is fanboying a bit too hard.",6,2,6,5 January 2020
Cloverfield," The found footage film strategy has not aged well
","I am seeing this after seeing The Cloverfield Paradox and without seeing 10 Cloverfield Lane. This film was rather disappointing because I am usually a sucker for films involving paranormal possibilities putting normal human beings in bizarre situations. The third cloverfield installment didn't hesitate to wander into complex and strange territory, while this film just played more like a higher budget found footage clone.",6,2,2,2 July 2019
Ready Player One," A heart-warming tribute to gamers with a cinematic experience only Spielberg can provide
","Let it be noted that I, as a lifelong gamer, had a strong positive bias for this film before I even sat down to view it. With that being said, I was blown away. I could not even begin to keep up with all of the references, hidden or obvious, to games, movies and pop culture. Spielberg out did himself with his creative vision of this retelling of the novel, and the visuals were positively stunning. For any gamer, this is an absolute must see. For any non-gamer, still a great watch. The only issue with this film is that its references will become more and more obsolete as time passes, as will the movie itself.",9,5,10,16 June 2018
Shutter Island," One of the most memorable plot twists of this decade
","I originally saw this film when it came out but couldn't remember it well enough to give it a rating or write a review, so a rewatch was in order. I viewed the film through the lens of already knowing the plot twist, which made it a whole different experience. The ending will be remembered throughout film history as one that showed just how viciously a well written script can flip an audience over. This really is a film you should see twice.",9,32,37,22 July 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Bad relative to budget doesn't mean bad through and through
","I'm a bit finicky about Star Wars because neither the original trilogy nor the prequels left a lasting impression on me. This leaves me in a peculiar position where I am fairly immune to the nostalgia hooks that Disney tried to live off of in the newest trilogy. The Rise of Skywalker is not as bad as some are making it out to be, and certainly not as bad as The Last Jedi. Fans across the world are so disappointed in this movie because they expect more in a finale. If this was a stand alone film it is decent, but it closes Star Wars out with a whimper.",7,4,8,26 December 2019
"Monsters, Inc."," The animation even holds up at times.
","I was recently gifted a '100 movie advent calendar' for Christmas. When you are ready to watch a movie you scratch one of the boxes off and it tells you what to watch. The first draw was Monsters, Inc. I haven't seen this classic for over 10 years, but my wife was pulling quotes out verbatim. The opening 10 minutes are executed to perfection. The characters are introduced nicely, the plot and obstacle to overcome laid out, the world built, and the comedic timing perfect. The compilation of Mike training Sully with scare exercises had me rolling. The movie does lose steam after this first 10 minutes but it certainly never sputters out. Monsters, Inc. is a classic for a reason, and is a must see.",9,2,2,29 December 2019
Léon: The Professional," Portman's proving grounds
","Leon thrives on its ability to maintain intrigue while constantly casting a slightly odd vibe. Breaking down the film into components makes me think it just shouldn't be very good, but I had a great time watching it. Portman is a rockstar and makes the film work by countering Jean Reno's 'Tommy Wiseau' vibe.",8,1,2,16 March 2020
Bird Box," Anyone who says this film is like A Quiet Place needs to take their blindfold off
","Bird Box is a Netflix original that shines in its telling of two interesting stories that converge in the final act. My biggest fear going into this film was that I wasn't going to be immersed into the world. Thankfully, the script focuses almost exclusively on past world building after explaining what is going on to our protagonists in the film's present day. The ever-ominous presence of the antagonist is thrilling, and I could just feel the frustration of having to stay blind folded while trying to survive. There wasn't enough going on to warrant any amazing rating for me, but it has been awhile since I have seen a film with a run-time over 2 hours long that has been able to keep my attention the entire time. If you have a Netflix subscription than check out Bird Box.",8,14,30,23 December 2018
Burn After Reading," Maintained a dark comedy feel even through the darkest parts
","Burn After Reading is my first run in with the Coen brothers, so I am completely unfamiliar with their style. What they seemed to have on their side from the get go was a rockstar cast filling all lead and character roles. Even some of the unknowns gave fiery performances. This film felt most similar to Requiem for a Dream both in theme and story-telling. I look forward to catching up on more Coen films in the future.",8,12,15,22 August 2019
Cast Away," Less harrowing than expected, and more whimsically adventerous.
","Cast Away was the 6th film unlocked on my 100 movie bucket list gift I received. Its greatest strength is in its pacing. Whenever I was beginning to get bored of what I was seeing, the plot would jump into a whole new segment and recapture my attention. Hanks gives a great performance as usual.",7,1,2,27 January 2020
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," The BEST depection of Spider-Man yet!
","This film was phenomenal for so many reasons. First and most importantly, it was the most visually impressive film I have seen to this day. The animation style alone had such a mystical and wonderous quality to it. The animators didn't stop there, however. They added so many little fun details that made me feel like I was watching some sort of blend between comic and movie. In addition to the gorgeous visual nature of Spider-Man, I was impressed by both the humor and the meta references. The reference to the cringey Spider-Man 3 scene and the post-credits meme reference were my personal favorites. There were tons of little details that I am sure I never truly appreciated because I have never been a consumer of comic books, but I have to imagine that this film is even more special to Marvel comic fans. The only gripe that I have with Spider-Man is that it failed to keep my attention in act 3. It was longer than it should have been, and it would have benefited greatly by cutting down 10 minutes. With that being said, this is the best movie I have seen in a few months and I hope that my review reaches someone who was not going to see it and urges them to reconsider.",9,23,40,17 December 2018
Spirited Away," I can't speak for the original or sub, but the dubbed version is a bad movie
","I went in expecting that this movie would have a chance of being one of my all time favorites. I couldn't have been more wrong. This is just a bad experience. The character and world design was great but the motivations and plot were snooze inducing. Take this review with a grain of salt, however, because I watched it dubbed. From what I have read, watching it dubbed completely changes the experience for whatever reason, so hopefully I can get back around to watching it correctly sometime.",Null,1,1,16 March 2020
Avengers: Endgame," A nearly perfect ending to an unprecedented movie-going journey
","Avengers: End Game can't compete on its own against the likes of The Godfather, Citizen Kane, or The Dark Knight, but the Marvel Cinematic Universe has never been about competing on your own. The MCU parallels it's own characters in the sense that it's strength lies not in each individual, but rather the sum of their parts. Avengers: End Game is a thrilling and satisfying conclusion to the seemingly untouchable Infinity Saga, whose 10 year presence has changed cinema forever.",9,4,8,26 April 2019
No Country for Old Men," A complex and relentless antagonist is the key to great cinema
","This film had been on my watch list for a year before I finally got around to seeing it. I was most impressed by the Coen brothers' ability to use the typical story arc for protagonists, antagonists, and supporting cast, and flip them on their head. I jaw dropped from surprise multiple times in the first act. This classic is a great watch.",9,3,3,11 September 2019
Toy Story 4," A fun film, if you ignore its gargantuan roots
","After watching all of the Toy Story movies over the past week, I can confidently come to the conclusion that the hierarchy goes 3>1>4=2. Toy Story 4 falls into that animated movie category where you feel like you had a decent time but the story will never stick with you. Like all of the films in the series, the characters discovered new and interesting things about themselves and there was an overarching lesson to be taught, but Toy Story 4 is ultimately much more forgettable than previous installments.",7,5,8,25 July 2019
The Favourite," The most masterfully created standalone film in 2018
","Where do I even begin. There is not a single aspect of cinema that this film did not tackle well. I was drawn into the world quickly and powerfully. The characters were potent, ambitious, and relatable. The themes were clear and intriguing. The cinematography and costume design were second to none. The performances by Emma Stone and Olivia Colman were stunning. This film was damn near perfect. From a film appreciation stand point, I would even argue that it may be the best I have ever seen. The reason that I am not giving it a perfect score is because it didn't quite scratch that ever-present itch I have for plot twists and betrayal in cinema.The Favourite is a story about manipulation, perseverance, elder abuse, and gaming the system. I highly recommend everyone see it.",10,7,14,21 February 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," A film that capitalized on the 10 years of characterization that preceded it
","Avengers: Infinity War is a spectacle to behold to the general audience. To the avid Marvel Studios fan, however, it is the epitome of movie going. It spends next to no time explaining the close relationships some characters share, and instead, builds the most memorable villain since Heath Ledger's Joker. If you have watched all of the other Marvel movies up to this point, you will be delighted, debilitated, and craving more.",10,4,6,28 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," The more you appreciate cinema as an art, the more you will like this film
","I would like to preface this review by expressing that I didn't particularly love this film as much as I expected to. Like many others, Tarantino is one of my favorite directors. I respect his fundamental consistency and his creative license above all else, and he lets both of those aspects shine through brightly in his 9th undertaking. It was this particular flavor of storytelling that he used this time around that I wasn't fond of. There was nothing difficult to follow about it, but it just didn't want to piece itself together into any coherent arcs. I can certainly appreciate that this was the feel Tarantino was going for, but it was not one I could appreciate during my viewing. With that being said, the story wraps up into a bizarre, unique, and satisfying conclusion that reminded me why I will always be in theaters for this director. What makes Tarantino so great is that he maintains such sound film fundamentals when taking on these strange and creative projects. His actors blew their roles out of the water, his cinematographer enhanced their potent performances further, and his set/costume decorators crafted a world of immersion. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is not a film everyone will love, but it is a film everyone should see.",9,274,472,30 July 2019
Drive," Boring characters but a fairly gripping story
","I was advised to watch this film by my friend who's movie taste I trust most. Maybe it was having such high expectations based off of his opinion, but Drive just didn't pack that oomph that is in any great thriller. It had brutal violence but to no plot progression. The brutality felt like it was just for the sake of realism and brutality, which is fair, but I would love for it to feel more reasonable for the characters. Drive doesn't have a convoluted enough plot or clever enough writing to sit amongst the kings of thrillers.",8,2,3,7 December 2019
Aladdin," Will Smith's Genie is legendary
","As many movie-goers know, live adaptations of animated films rarely fair well. Thankfully, Aladdin is an exception. One of the biggest question marks coming in was how Will Smith could possibly fill the shoes of Robin Williams. I think it is safe to say that they have been filled and expanded, because Smith's genie was phenomenal. The entire 'You Ain't Never Had a Friend Like Me' scene had me glued to the screen in awe and wonder. I have to imagine a quarter of the budget was dropped in that 2 minute window. The only thing better than the effects was the costume design, which I believe is deserving of any number of nominations. The one gripe I had with the film, albeit a minor one, is that it could have stood to cut 10 minutes out by eliminating the 'Speechless' songs. It ultimately added nothing to the story and the second song felt like I was watching some weird fan flick. Don't count this film out!",8,10,18,12 June 2019
Room," A story of human perserverance and frailty
","The heart of Room lies in its portrayal of believable human reactions to a horrific circumstance. Director Lenny Abrahamson pulls the audience into the room that our protagonists are in, making us feel like we are stuck their with them. Once in the room, Jacob Tremblay and Brie Larson's performances win me over to their side and have me audibly rooting them on as they figure out an escape plan. Room is solid all around and will not leave you feeling bored because of its interesting choice to shift tone halfway through. Check it out.",8,3,7,27 February 2019
The Lion King," Shockingly realistic visual effects take away from emotional expressivity
","For only rating this movie as a 7/10, I sure feel like I have a lot to say about it. The vision of the film was clearly to make the most realistic version of the classic tale as possible, and it succeeded spectacularly in that way. The wildlife and natural scenery were bar none in the world of CGI grounded in realism. This also happens to be its greatest downfall, however. By creating ultra-realistic lions, they sacrifice a huge part of what made the original lion king so special: emotional expressivity in the faces of the animals. So now we have reached an interesting point in our movie-tech, where we can create animation that looks worse but portrays human emotion well, or we can make things hyper-realistic. I look forward to the day we can have both. The voice acting cast was phenomenal. Specifically, John Oliver, Donald Glover, and Seth Rogan came out to play. Beyonce and Glover were interesting to hear sing together, with Glover holding down the lower, constant melodies, and Beyonce controlling the song. There were times that it felt Beyonce was going a bit too far and the character no longer felt like Nala, but rather, Beyonce.",7,5,9,25 July 2019
A Quiet Place," Truly one of a kind.
","This was the single most bizarre theatre experience I have ever had. I went to watch it on a Tuesday night with my friends. The showing was on the biggest screen, and every seat was filled with an undergraduate. Now as many could attest, college students aren't always quietest when out with friends in the evening. Que the start of the movie....and THE ENTIRE MOVIE being completely dead silent with little to no score, and only 10 lines of dialogue. Nobody so much as reached into their popcorn. If it wasn't for the movie creating such a strange atmosphere, I probably would have docked its rating a bit. Watching this film out of theatres would likely inhibit the experience a fair amount. Brutal at times, and immersive, I am proud of Krasinski for taking on this project and performing so well as director.",8,5,9,16 June 2018
Ex Machina," Touching, thought-provoking, and haunting
","Alicia Vikander's performance as the A.I. was breathtaking. Cold deliveries while still managing to express enough human-like emotion to pass a Turing Test. Ex Machina will keep you hooked through every minute, before finally culminating in a jaw-dropping final act.",9,4,7,15 July 2018
1917," To be shown to film students when they study cinematography
","At the time of writing this, 1917 is up for 10 Oscars, fresh off the high of winning best drama at the Golden Globes. I haven't poured into exactly what it is nominated for, but I know that it is up for best picture and best cinematography. Unfortunately, I can't say I agree with the academy on it being a best picture contender. That being said, this is some of the most brilliant cinematography I have ever seen in my life. For the uninitiated, the film is shot in such a way that it seems like it is all done in 1 or 2 scenes. I know some big name films have done this before, but this is my first experience with the style. When you combo that 1 take with the brilliant picture and color that 1917 provides, you end up with a stylish and enthralling story that would have otherwise felt lackluster. Definitely worth a watch and a cinematography Oscar.",8,14,22,15 January 2020
Children of Men," Interesting action shots and memorable characters
","Children of Men finds greatness in two distinct ways; characterization and cinematography. The latter of the two I am historically a sucker for. My being drawn to the excellent character building in this film was a surprise to me, however, because it did not accompany an interesting and developing plot. I view character building as secondary to plot building. I cannot think of a film off the top of my head that I applaud without an interesting story. Children of Men is truly lacking in narrative, but it gains back a fair bit of ground by making the audience feel like they are with the characters. I believe this feeling is partly because the characters are so well crafted and acted, and partly because the wildly drawn out action shots make us feel like we are following the group. One action shot is held for 5+ minutes without any camera break. This style of cinematography really works in war movies or gunfights, and I hope to see more of it in the future.",8,2,5,25 November 2018
Midsommar," The horror genre is changing for the better
","My mind is blown. If the 2010's are not remembered as the horror film renaissance I will be surprised. Midsommar proves that you do not need shocking and clever twists to create a phenomenal film. It's strength lies in its sound design, cinematography, and chilling score, which all serve to highlight the truly unsettling moments that director Ari Aster creates. None of these aspects is nearly as potent without the other. As an example, let us look at the scene where our female lead is kneeled on the ground crying, surrounded by handmaidens. Director and writer Ari Aster can be credited with creating the situation which has our protagonist in so much pain, but also with working the actress to convey the most realistic agony and grief I have ever seen on screen. Lead actress Florence Pugh is to be given credit for this amazing performance, but it cannot be coincidence that both leads in Aster's films have shown heartbreaking performances. There simply must be some method he is using that no other director does as well, to get his actors to portray pain so well. Now that the scene is set, music by The Haxan Cloak envelopes the audience in a sense of urgency and dread with their score. As the music plays and Pugh's character runs into the housing unit with maidens in toe, the camera pans brilliantly with a perfectly timed 180 cut that will set up a truly iconic moment. This scene isn't particularly brilliant from a cinematographic standpoint when compared to other moments in the film where Pawel Pogorzelski controlled the scene with his camera work. Finally, we find Pugh's character crying out in agony over and over again on the floor of the bunkhouse. What makes this scene so chilling and memorable is the 8 or so maidens surrounding her attempting to comfort her by matching her emotions. As Pugh cries out, each maiden cries out in unison, not in tune or pace at first as they try to get the hang of it. After 30 seconds or so, they are in perfect pace and it almost seems as if they are mocking her, but it is absolutely haunting. Midsommar is one of the best horror films ever created and is not for the faint of heart.",9,19,45,5 July 2019
The Last Samurai," Run of the mill solid movie
",Tom Cruise is entertaining and plays his serious role well. The action is well-choreographed. The costume design is intriguing. There really isn't any glaring weakness in this film but nothing is particularly stand out. A fun popcorn film for a weekend evening.,7,2,5,16 February 2020
The Shape of Water," Shaped up to be a good film
","Ignoring its roots in fantasy, The Shape of Water is one of the most emotionally human films I have seen this year. The bonds between our protagonist and her friends (human or not) were prominent, even with characters who had less screen time. One improvement that could have been made was with our antagonist, who seemed quite forced and undriven. Was the film deserving of 4 Oscars, including best picture? Probably not. But that shouldn't stop you from spending a quiet night enjoying Guillermo del Toro's golden egg.",8,4,7,15 July 2018
The Departed," Twist endings and Leo, name a better duo
","Nicholson, Damon, and Dicaprio make for an absolute powerhouse trio in this classic film. I have had this on my watch list for quite some time, and although it wasn't as rock solid as I was expecting, it's ending was right up my alley. Aside from the phenomenal acting and the satisfying conclusion, I was only impressed with the simplicity of which a complex double-rat story was told. I never felt lost trying to keep track of who worked for who and who was spying on who, because the filmmakers laid it out so clearly for me.",8,5,8,2 July 2019
Joker," What makes the perfect villain?
","Heath Ledger showed us that a truly terrifying antagonist can't be reasoned with. Joaquin Phoenix now shows us how anyone can even reach such a point. Joker is a character study of the clinically insane and wildly unfortunate comedian/clown looking for a break in Gotham.The film's primary strength is the first-rate performance by Joaquin Phoenix, but it is further bolstered by a number of interesting creative choices and sound fundamentals. Sound is putting it modestly. The prodigious score by Hildur Guðnadóttir marches the plot forward as cinematographer Lawrence Sher always seems to find the perfect shot. This all comes together into a fantastic whirlwind of surprise and jaw-dropping disbelief as director Todd Phillips plays with audience and character perception like puppets on a string.Joker is relentless in its character building and storytelling. It is without a doubt, film of the year.",10,3,5,4 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Far too long for its own good
","I have always been an advocate for long films. If I see that a film has a 3 hour run-time, I am usually thrilled. That is because I believe a truly great story needs time to develop characters and commit the viewer to the experience. It Chapter Two is a prime example of a film that boasts a long run-time without using it properly, and it becomes a real drag. Many times the stunning visuals and costume design in combination with a gut-wrenching performance by Bill Skarsgard would have me at the edge of my seat, only to slowly sit me back as all momentum slowly burned out. It also dawned on me that the horror if IT is best viewed through the lens of a child protagonist. Some moments with a full adult squad just felt disingenuous.",8,14,25,6 September 2019
Parasite," Unconventional and terrific
","The Academy Awards are in 5 days and Parasite is nominated for 6 Oscars, including best picture. I thought that the most simple comparison to make is between this and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Both films are entertaining throughout the entire run-time, but really blast off in a bizarre fashion in the final minutes. Parasite is at its best when it uses haunting imagery and compelling character relationships to drive the plot forward. This is one to root for at the awards.",9,18,28,5 February 2020
The Big Short," A dramatic documentery, or a documentory-like drama?
","The Big Short is carried almost exclusively by its massive star power. When stripped down to just the story, cinematography, and artistic style of the film, it sinks quickly. Fortunately, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale, and a cast of supporting actors drenched in star power are able to make this Wall Street story an interesting one. The 4th-wall breaks also help to keep it fresh.",7,2,5,25 June 2019
Marriage Story," As potent and real as a story can be
","I vow to see more Drama films in 2020. Marriage Story surprised me on multiple accounts. Firstly, it solidified my predilection for well-acted drama, which I have been leerily pushing aside for a year now. Secondly, it proved Adam Driver to be the phenomenal actor that I have been told he is, and was unwilling to believe. What a waste of his talent Kylo Ren was! Marriage Story is the first film to make me tear up from sorrow or empathy rather than overwhelming emotion in 2 years. A must watch.",9,9,13,6 January 2020
Black Panther," A high budget superhero film with great action. Clears the floor, non-abrasively, for a dialogue about racial issues in America
","I was skeptical entering Black Panther. Not because I was worried it would be a bad film, but because I was worried it would attempt to enter a political dialogue where Marvel Studios simply doesn't belong. I was pleasantly surprised to see that, although it did touch on serious issues in America, it did so in a respectful and humanistic manner. It wove these issues into the motivation for our antagonist, who joins the ranks of a new breed of villain in cinema; a villain who the audience can relate to. I look forward to this trend continuing, and not only in superhero films. The highlight of this viewing for me was the phenomenal hip hop score led by Kendrick Lamar.",8,3,7,15 June 2018
Toy Story 3," New animation tech, same ole' Toy Story
","I wanted to view all of the Toy Story movies in preparation for Toy Story 4. I had seen 1 and 2 as a kid so the rewatches were nice, but Toy Story 3 was fresh and I loved it! The call backs to the previous two films were great. The three highlights were those that we have grown accustomed to in all Toy Story movies: A delightful and cheery score, phenomenal voice acting, and an interesting story that teaches a moral lesson. Looking forward to the fourth installment tomorrow!",9,4,4,22 July 2019
Midway," Solid cast giving it their all
","Midway has starpower and an absurd amount of naval and aerial combat. Unless you absolutely love planes, WWII, Nick Jonas, or battleships, this is just going to be an okay film.",6,5,7,24 November 2019
50_50," A hard film to hate
","Watching this movie 8 years after it released has made me realize Anna Kendrick doesn't age and Seth Rogan is well past is comedy prime. 50/50 is your generic feel good story that will give you a chuckle, a disheartened frown, and finally, a lingering smile.",7,5,5,4 August 2019
Green Book," No rising and falling action. Just captivative excellence all the way thorugh.
","I haven't seen a film like Green Book in quite some time. A film that doesn't have long-winded exposition followed by a dramatic resolution, but that is still satisfying the entire way through. I liken it to Forrest Gump in the sense that the captivation does not come from a place of waiting to see what comes next, but rather, it comes from being in that moment with the characters. Viggo Mortensen's performance was astonishing as a firmly rooted New Yorker. It certainly helped that Director Peter Farrelly pulled me into the 60s about thirty seconds into the opening scene. Green Book is a character driven film in which the characters are complex enough to remove certain aspects of predictability that we expect from most films. This was one of the best I have seen from 2018 and I recommend anyone give it a try.",9,8,15,12 January 2019
Annihilation," The strings didn't quite tie together but I liked it anyways
","Ex Machina and Annihilation are both directed by Alex Garland, and both dissect the delicate relationship between man and mystery. While Ex Machina investigates the relationship between mankind and machines, Annihilation investigates man and nature. The parallels between the two films are striking, but Annihilation falls short in comparison, despite having two strong legs to stand on. Some of the scenery felt cheesy, but the story was satisfying.",8,2,5,12 August 2018
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," A bizarre classic that is still worth a watch
","Surreal humor, or absurdist humor, was a brand new experience to me in a full feature presentation. I was constantly caught off guard with The Pythons' jokes and scene progression. That part was rather enjoyable. The film will likely go down in history as having the longest legs of any absurdist comedy, with many quotes and jokes being told now 30+ years later from folks who may not even know they are quoting it (I am guilty of this). Ultimately, however, the film was meant to be a comedy and it didn't get me to laugh all that much.",7,3,6,21 March 2019
Incredibles 2," A fantastic movie, if not compared to The Incredibles
","A very good animated film that resides in the shadow of The Incredibles. Incredibles 2 pales in comparison to its predecessor, even with technological advances in animation. The story was not nearly as memorable or interesting, but there are some laugh out loud moments and, ultimately, a great message. Great film for the whole family.",8,4,5,19 June 2018
Moon," A tragic and surreal tale of a man questioning everything he knows
","Advertised as a cerebral and mind-bending thriller, Moon fails to deliver on its promised premise. Despite this, it has an interesting story to tell about human morality and frailty. There is not many twists that are going to shock the audience, but the small surprises are capitalized on.",7,3,4,31 May 2019
The Nice Guys," Unique filmmaking compounded by strong leads
","Crowe and Gosling positively captivated me with their dynamic throughout the entire film. There never seemed to be a dull moment thanks to director Shane Black's ability to catch the audience off-guard at any second with a unique and/or bizarre bit. The villain and their motives are a bit hazy and some action scenes go a bit too long near the end, but these small negatives pale in comparison to the positives the film brings to the table. It is hard to put into words exactly why The Nice Guys is so good, but I assure you if you watch the first 15 minutes you will find out.",9,6,8,2 July 2019
The Martian," Isolation even greater than what COVID can cause
","This is a space nerd's movie. This is a problem solver's movie. When you are in space you don't get emotional. You figure out what the problems are and you solve them one at a time. If you solve enough problems, then you get to come home alive. The Martian does a great job of displaying the loneliness of the situation its protagonist is in. I really appreciated that it doesn't keep you constantly worried about what the next unexpected disaster would be. It is an easy ride that introduces challenges just as swiftly as our characters solve them. The theme of isolation fit nicely into this quarantine lifestyle we are living.",8,2,2,16 April 2020
