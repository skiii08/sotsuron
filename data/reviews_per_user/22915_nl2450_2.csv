Mission: Impossible III," When other films talk 'Non-Stop Action' MI3 delivers!
","Well, OK, not truly non-stop but definitely enough to keep the action junkies out there happy. Still, there is a little too much 'collateral damage' for my taste (stuff that really should not have been destroyed) Oh well. I'm not in charge of the movie. Plus I really hated M:I II's chase scene, way to much collateral damage there. J.J. Abrams does a respectable job in this, although it at times (especially in the Vatican) seems a little too much like Alias. The story was a little on the weak side, but there were some pretty funny moments like when they exchanged 'rings' (little dogs on a ring) The gadgets, like the other films, were pretty cool, from the Kodak camera Ethan gets his mission from to the make-up mirror digital camera/face replicator and the micro-dot chip. There were some sad moments too like when Lindsey dies with 1 second to go on the defib machine. As far as best, I'd say it's just behind the original but way ahead of M:I 2. Anyone who has played the N64 MI game will recognize one of the musical pieces played early on in the film. (The other system releases probably are the same but I've only played the N64 title)",9,1,1,12 May 2006
Cars," Very good!
","Excellent movie, another Pixar classic! All of the characters are well modeled and voiced, with very good specular details (reflections), and there are also very heart-touching moments, like when they divulge that Radiator Springs was bypassed when they built the big interstate, and also learning that Doc Hudson had won several Piston Cups but was 'deserted' because of a crash. They also apparently studied a lot about NASCAR because the race scenes were pretty much spot-on. The sound design was also excellent, from the gravel underneath the tires to the crashes and engines. As mentioned before, voice-acting was very good. I really liked Larry the Cable Guy doing Mater. He even does his GIT-R-DONE! catchphrase. The scene where Mater and Lightning were scaring the farm tractors was very funny. I'm definitely getting this when it comes out on DVD.",10,3,4,19 June 2006
