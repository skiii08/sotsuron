","I was really surprised how well this movie came out. I think most people (me included) were thinking that this movie wouldn't be able to do that day and that flight justice. And that it would either be cheesy and lame or political. Instead it came out very real, very touching, and extremely well made.One thing that I liked was that they didn't use any recognizable actors. I thought that this helped the realism. All of the actors did an excellent job of capturing the events. I think it is an excellent tribute to the men and women of 9/11 and United 93. I would encourage everyone to go and see this movie.-David",10,1,3,26 May 2006
