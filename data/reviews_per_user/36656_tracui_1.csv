The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," janifer lawrence needs to be trained how to act
","Katniss criticized her sister went back to save her cat and said the cat was stupid cat, her sister can do whatever she wants. I really hate her with no mercy with animals, and acted like she was kindhearted in the movie, such a hypocrite. Jenifer Lawrence's acting was awful, for example, at the beginning when she step on the skull, that is not how a person will act in real life, face expression is more complex than just cover your mouth and shred a tear, for people who are more emotional unstable they would even hold their fists so tight and tremble, but her character does not fit in this category and she has experience of seeing dead, so all she needed to act is complex face expression.",1,23,33,7 February 2015
