The Blair Witch Project," Not worth wasting your money on!
","I doubt if many films over the years have seemed as much of a waste of money when they are finished as this overhyped and virtually suspenseless film which can certainly not be called horror. If the footage had been real then it would have been scary, but instead it is relentlessly predictable and quite often unconvincing from beginning to end. Nobody would keep filming whilst they are in the middle of fighting someone in an hysterical frenzy themselves. The dialogue was alsoo abominable with the F'word used to the nth degree. The woman's voice was also very irritating. One of the actors gave a fine performance (not Joshua Leonard)and there was some originality in the filming etc and the final scene was quite clever, but there is absolutely nothing else to recommend it. The story was very thin and the camera technique used may have been different but it also limited the potential of any plot development. I also think that very little imagination was shown in the few suspense sequences present in the movie. It does not even come close to frightening the viewer for even a second. All in all its just a pretty boring thriller which would certainly have work better if; -a). It was just shown on TV, and b). It only last for sixty minutes.Its definitely not worth wasting your money on.",Null,0,0,4 November 1999
