Miracle," Disney does it again.
","Disney has now fallen into a new category.  They are now a movie company that can take a good movie or event and once again destroy it.  If you have ever had the opportunity to see the original movie about the 1980 team, `The Miracle on Ice,' you will find that the original showed more coach and player interaction.  The wonderful world or Disney decided to show a family being torn during the training of the team and then the family bonding. That is great, but they could have played off more on the players.  For example, Jim Craig.  He story was a great story to milk from (not going to tell you about it for you may not have seen it).  What about the relationship Mike Cruzione really had with Brooks?As for the decision to show the hockey games in action, they were not well done at all.  They did not show enough of the games where as a person who watched the Olympics that year saw the team mold more as a team as each period unfolded.  In the original they had shown actual clips of the actual games, and in my opinion brought back fond memories of the moment!Please don't let my opinion take away from what our players and coaches did back in 1979 and 1980.  They were a true miracle that this country needed. Even though I thought the movie was very lack luster, it is one that people should see to feel how important one event can help not only a few men, but a whole nation!  Thank you Herb Brooks and the other 20 players who made the team.  Thank you for not only winning the Gold medal, but thank you for helping this country!",3,2,10,1 February 2004
Alien vs. Predator," Not happy with the movie
","If you are one of the only people alive who have not seen any of the Alien movies and you plan to see this movie, you should enjoy it. However, for those who have seen all of the Aliens and Predator movies wait for this to come out on DVD 5 day rental.The director and writer of the movie, Paul Anderson, who claims to be an avid lover of both series has found a way to destroy the basis them in this movie. He forgot some of the most basic of elements of the movies while doing the movie. This movie did not really even come close in grabbing the audience nor did it even scare you. WaitÂ… there was once scene without either the Alien or Predator that was scary. Alien Vs. Predator? There were 4 confrontations with the Alien(s) and Predator(s). The movie should have been called, 10 humans running around with heads chopped off in a building with some Predators and Aliens. You can probably tell what my vote was for this movie (6). The reason it was so high is due to the fact that the few confrontations with the 2 stars, they were not that bad.If you decide to see the movie in the theaters, don't expect to be blown away with excitement.",6,0,0,14 August 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," Wait for it to come out on ABC
","This is probably the biggest letdown for a major motion picture in the past 10 years.  Without revealing any scenes from the movie, can you say deja vu and vu and vu.  They tried to force this one upon us.  This movie will probably be ranked next to Star Wars episode II for being very poor movies which did not live up to the hype.  If you decide that you must see this, wait and see it at the dollar show and save your money.",1,0,0,15 May 2003
