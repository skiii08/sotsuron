Scarface," a great rags to riches epic under the palm trees
","'scarface' is probably the best movie i've ever seen. with that said, i can only try to justify my words. even though i'm not a big de palma fan, he really stood out with this revision of the 30s classic. however, instead of chicago, we are set in miami as tony montana arrives from cuba as a criminal, and tries to sneak into the drug business to make big bucks. now the performances on this one are A-M-A-Z-I-N-G especially, of course, al pacino's who plays tony montana perfectly and delivers a rather strange cuban accent when he speaks spanish, but in my opinion, that only adds a sense of uniqueness to the character. all the other actors are great as well, especially stephen bauer and my much hated michelle pfeiffer. as in 'the godfather' this long movie moves on from classic situation to classic situation leaving no room for breath to the spectator. i don't want to give any details about any scene so i don't spoil them up, but i cannot put enough stress on how much i liked this movie. i'll just say one thing: 'say hello to my little friend!!' totally recommended. 10/10",10,0,1,19 March 2004
