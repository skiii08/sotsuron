The Lobster," Amusing, but kind of empty
","Dystopian sci-fi with an extremely absurdist twist. Single people are brought to a hotel where they are forced to pair up. If they don't, after a certain amount of time they will be physically transformed into an animal of their choice. Colin Farrell, the latest arrival, has chosen a lobster. This film is enjoyably odd. I especially loved the characters' robotic dialogue, which is sometimes just very funny. However, I had no real connection to it and, in the end, it didn't seem to me to be much else but weirdness for the sake of being weird. The characters and situation are so far removed from actual humanity, you'd have to work hard to find that it has anything particularly insightful to say about society, or even its more closely examined subjects like singlehood or relationships. Other recognizable actors include Rachel Weisz, John C. Reilly, Lea Seydoux and Ben Whishaw.",7,1,6,5 June 2016
The Avengers," Excellent, though they could have done better with the bad guys
","Loki has come to Earth and stolen an ancient artifact that will give him unlimited power. S.H.I.E.L.D. gathers a group of superheroes, which they call the Avengers, to defeat the evil. Okay, the villains and their goals are kind of lame (disappointing because Loki was a great villain in Thor - although, I must say, Tom Hiddleton is still very good in the role), but the focus of this film is mostly the superheroes. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, the Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye - with all of these guys, this movie should be a total mess. But the screenwriters (Joss Whedon & Zak Penn) have handled it beautifully, meting out dozens of great moments for all of them, not letting any one of them take over (although the Hulk almost does just because he's so awesome - funny, as he's never had a successful solo movie) nor fall behind, and never seeming too hard like it's trying to do that. There are times when the film is too thick with exposition, but the characters and the actors are all so good that it rarely drags (there's one long sequence where a bunch of characters are fighting amongst themselves that I thought felt a tad forced). The heroes' personalities and histories are utilized in impressive ways - I especially love the way they use Captain America's datedness (one particularly hilarious gag - and Whedon does a great job with the comic moments - has Captain America feeling overjoyed at finally getting a reference when someone refers to The Wizard of Oz). That this movie is anywhere near as good as it is is something of a miracle. It's pretty much the perfect summer movie - everything else this summer is going to have a lot to live up to.",8,1,4,6 May 2012
Changeling," Very good
","I have to say, I'm shocked at the mediocre critical reaction to this film. It's the kind of perfectly good, middlebrow flick that they usually bend over backward to praise. Any other year, this would be the frontrunner for Best Picture. Personally, I'm never that impressed with the usual films that make newspaper critics' top ten lists. Sometimes I downright dislike them. This isn't one I disliked. I rather did like it. In fact, it's my favorite Eastwood-directed film since Mystic River. I think it's a lot less flawed than Million Dollar Baby, and a lot less lifeless than his two WWII films from a couple years back. Angelina Jolie plays a single mother in 1928 Los Angeles. One day, when she is forced to work overtime, her nine year old son disappears. After a five month investigation, the police find and return her son – only it's not her son. In fact, it's another boy who looks somewhat similar, but he's three inches shorter and circumcized. Most of the film follows Jolie's desperate and futile attempts to fight the police force, who refuse to accept her story. The film is based on a true story, one that dragged out for quite a while. I think a lot of critics felt that the film is poorly paced because of this, but I thought screenwriter J. Michael Straczynski did an admirable job of keeping it moving. Jolie is fantastic. I also very much liked Jeffrey Donovan as the corrupt police captain. On the other hand, I thought Jason Butler Harner overplayed his role. The thing that Eastwood always excels at is the look of his films, and everything here, from cinematography to costumes to production design, is perfect.",8,4,7,2 November 2008
Frost_Nixon," Excellent all around
","Gripping account of Richard Nixon's first television interview after resigning from the Presidency. It was conducted by a man who was strictly an entertainer, Englishman David Frost, who believed it would be a great way to become famous in America. At the beginning, he has no real convictions, but the researchers he has hired (Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell) motivate him to attempt to give Nixon the conviction he never received from the American justice system. When the interviews begin, it turns out to be a David and Goliath story, with Frost unable to compete with Nixon. The strongest point of the film are the performances. Langella in particular hits a homerun, giving perhaps the best fictional performance of Richard Nixon yet in cinema. Much like in The Queen, which was also written by playwright Peter Morgan, Michael Sheen holds his own against a powerhouse performer. Also great are Kevin Bacon, playing Nixon's former Chief of Staff, now a defeated, hurt man desperately trying to redeem his boss, and Sam Rockwell, as Frost's most passionate researcher. Though based on a play, Frost/Nixon almost never betrays that origin. It's intimate, but open. I don't know how much you can credit director Ron Howard with the film's success  I imagine that its success belongs more to the actors and Morgan  but it is by quite a distance the best movie he's ever directed.",9,3,6,14 December 2008
The Incredible Hulk," No better than Ang Lee's version, but if you want action, you'll get action
","A 'reboot' of the series, following Ang Lee's disastrous (performance-wise) Hulk. I'm one of those who thought that film wasn't that bad. I'm not one who thinks it's great, either, but it was entertaining. I don't think The Incredible Hulk is any better, and I'd probably rank it a tad below Lee's film. This one is more action-oriented, although I honestly think the percentage of running time the action lasts is similar in both movies. The Incredible Hulk wraps its thin story around three giant action sequences, each better than the last. It's a lot of fun during those parts. Other parts, eh, not so much. It's fine, but it's the kind of movie where you keep thinking, 'Okay, blow something up already.' I still have the same major problem with this one that I did with the last one: CGI. Yeah, I'm beating a dead horse, if you're familiar with my point of view already. I especially don't think CGI works when the animated characters are supposed to be humanoid. When the Hulk is standing next to Liv Tyler, to me it's no more convincing an interaction than when Mary Poppins dances with cartoon penguins. I liked the nods to the TV series, including a hitchhiking scene, the sad piano music and a cameo by Lou Ferrigno.",7,3,7,15 June 2008
Lucky Number Slevin," Fun, if a tad predictable
","This suffers somewhat in comparison to Brick, which I watched for the second time right before I saw Slevin. Like Brick, it's a noir / crime flick that attempts stylized dialogue. The dialogue in Slevin succeeds at being clever and entertaining. Unfortunately, the film itself never feels as weighty as Brick. It shoots only for coolness, where Brick has more of a soul. Still, that doesn't mean that Slevin is worthless. Far from it. It's actually very entertaining. Josh Hartnett makes up for his terrible 2006 performance in The Black Dahlia. He's very good here; people who don't believe he has talent should see this. Lucy Liu is gorgeous, and she delivers her dialogue with appropriate slickness. A lot of the pleasure comes from her and Hartnett simply interacting. Bruce Willis, Stanely Tucci, Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman are all good, too. The twisty story is fairly predictable. It's still fun, though.",7,1,3,2 October 2006
Sucker Punch," A disaster
","A crime against the cinema. It's too bad. I honestly have enjoyed Zack Snyder's films in the past, besides that crappy owl movie he made last year. I'd classify them more as guilty pleasures than actual good movies, but I found them entertaining and neat to look at. Sucker Punch, though, combines all his worst traits and adds a script that he himself wrote (along with co-writer Steve Shibuya). His previous films were all adaptations, three of picture books and one a remake of a George A. Romero classic. He didn't have to think much himself to make those neat images. Sucker Punch demonstrates that he just doesn't have the ability to think of things himself. It's a movie that combines mental hospitals, burlesque shows, giant samurai warriors, half-mechanical zombie-Nazis, mech suits, orcs, dragons, killer robots, and atomic bombs, pretty much every cool thing one can think of.And then one might guess that the problem is overkill. It isn't (well, that may be a smaller problem). The major problem is that there's not a single thing we haven't seen before here. Also, the plot is created in the worst possible way. The skeleton of it is pretty much identical to Inception. While this film had to have been conceived beforehand, so you can't blame it for ripping Nolan's film off, that's just one more strike against it. Emily Browning plays a girl who accidentally kills her sister while trying to defend her from her rampaging stepfather. She's sent to a mental hospital, where she hides behind two levels of reality. In the first level down, she's the new girl at a burlesque house/whorehouse. Snyder inserts a very video game-esque premise: she and her hooker friends (Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens and Jamie Chung) are basically sex slaves, and they must find five objects to help them escape. Now, up to this point, the film is tolerable. It's not good, but it's watchable. The girls are very attractive, and the visuals are kind of old-fashioned and nice to look at.But here comes the third level: whenever the girls are about to steal the next thing they need to escape, they all descend into a fantasy world which is about the most video game-like thing to ever appear in a movie. Well, kind of. There was Scott Pilgrim vs. the World last year. That one actually used video games in a clever, metaphorical way, and it did it with its tongue in its cheek. Snyder really thinks we want to watch people play video games on the big screen. The worst thing was, after I experienced the abject horrors of how boring this could possibly be the first time, I realized I was going to have to sit through this same thing four more times. Oh, these sequences are beyond awful, with these girls fighting through dozens of not-very-great-looking CGI Nazis, robots, orcs, whatever. This is the worst parts of every event movie of the past decade mashed into never-ending sequences. There's nothing logical about the existence of these sequences. The funny thing is, in that second level of reality, while these fantasy sequences are going on, Browning is dancing sexily in front of whomever the girls want to distract. I think Snyder had to have known that the premise that this girl is such a sexy dancer that anyone watching her would be so utterly distracted that the other girls could steal from them was laughably ridiculous. But, watching the movie, I'm not so sure he was smart enough to realize this. He's also not smart enough to realize that the audience this film was intended for would probably rather be watching the girl dance sexily than watch these hot girls play video games in front of us.While these video game sequences are some of the worst cinema I've ever experienced, and about the worst bit of narrative, as well, Snyder isn't done completely screwing up. He completely miscalculates which characters the audience gives a damn about. He also doesn't make any sense of the connection between the first and second levels of reality (we'll thankfully forget about the third), and characters whom we met in the second level but not in the first aren't able to connect to the audience when we meet them there. The film ends with a character whom we don't know and don't give a crap about. And then I stand up and flee the theater, and it's all I can do not to start a riot in the lobby.",2,157,324,27 March 2011
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Cliché
","Mostly a trite and clichéd high school picture. Logan Lerman is miscast as a moody high school freshman (who looks like he' at least 16) who befriends a group of seniors (Ezra Miller, Emma Watson and Mae Whitman chief amongst them) who help him come out of his shell. That's not too unbelievable, but it becomes increasingly silly when Whitman becomes romantically involved with him, and Stone, on whom Lerman is crushing, would probably be game if she weren't already involved. This plays out like a fantasy, not reality. If you've ever been in a high school as an adult the maturity difference between freshmen and seniors - Hell, freshmen and sophomores - is hugely pronounced. Even among alterna-kids, no 18 year old girl is going to even think about dating a 14/15 year old. I couldn't quite get over that, but that's hardly the only flaw. Ezra Miller is definitely the stand-out. His homosexual character is a bit cliché, but I was happy that they actually weren't afraid to give him a sex life (though not graphic, I'm surprised it didn't land an R-rating because of it).",6,53,112,25 December 2012
3:10 to Yuma," The original is in general better
","I guess you can't complain too much that they remade 3:10 to Yuma. After all, the original is a pretty shameless rip-off of High Noon. As much as a rip-off as it is, though, I thought it was better than High Noon. And, while Delmer Daves' original is fantastic, it's not like it's perfect or anything. It can be improved upon, I suppose. Unfortunately, James Mangold's remake doesn't improve upon it, except for maybe one bit, which I'll get to in a minute. The remake adds over 20 minutes, but it doesn't bother to flesh out the characters. In fact, the roles are flatter here than they were in the original. The extra plot points are unnecessary. They should especially have excised an entire sequence in which Luke Wilson makes a cameo. Not only does that sequence have the distracting, 'Hey, look! That's Luke Wilson' factor, it just doesn't add anything. It has been a while since I've seen the original, but, as I recall, it was pretty close to a real-time thriller, with Dan Evans guarding Ben Wade until the 3:10 arrives for most of the film. This is only a short portion of the new one. It is the best portion, though. It doesn't solve the problems of the original, although I don't personally consider the characters' actions too problematic in either version, as many people do. The reason that the remake might be worth seeing is the ending. It's quite a bit different than the original (unless I'm misremembering), and it brings the story to a higher level than the original achieved. As for the acting, it's mostly passable. But again it pales in comparison to the original. Both Van Heflin and Glenn Ford have some great movies and performances to their names, but I think 3:10 to Yuma was the peak of both their careers. I'm not a huge fan of either Christian Bale or Russell Crowe, but they've both done better. Crowe is great in that final sequence, however. As for the other actors, most are not worth remembering. I did really like the kid who played Dan Evans' son, Logan Lerman. Watch for him in the future. And Ben Foster can add his name to the list of the classic superbad henchman characters in Westerns. He was wonderfully evil. I probably sounded like I didn't like the film much. That's not true. It's just that it's not as good as its predecessor, which, to me, means it doesn't have much reason to exist.",7,1,2,30 September 2007
Source Code," A fine sci-fi thriller
","Entertaining sci-fi thriller by Duncan Jones, whose debut film was the mind-bending Moon a couple of years ago. Jake Gyllenhaal plays a military man who is part of an experiment where he can enter the mind of a dead man for an eight minute span. He's made to do this by his superiors so he can scope for evidence in a crime, here the bombing of a train in Chicago. At first, Gyllenhaal is disoriented and does not understand his purpose. He becomes attached to a woman on the train (Michelle Monaghan), but, after those initial eight minutes, his superiors (Vera Farmiga and Jeffrey Wright) inform him that everyone on that train has already died, that he cannot change that, and that his only purpose on this mission is to figure out who is responsible so that the authorities can prevent a second terrorist attack. He goes back and re-lives those same eight minutes - and then he does it again and again. Much like in Moon, there are some major weaknesses in the story. In particular, it sets up rules that it pretty much ignores as it nears the end. And I was never quite as attached to Gyllenhaal's character as I was to Rockwell's in the previous film (though I will complement Gyllenhaal on a fine performance). But I still found the film very gripping and breathlessly paced. The plot may remind some of the television show Quantum Leap, as it must have Jones and company: he casts Scott Bakula in the role of Gyllenhaal's father (who is only heard on the phone). It was even more similar, in my mind, to the underrated 2006 film Deja Vu, which I might slightly prefer to Source Code even though, God forbid, it was directed by Tony Scott.",8,0,3,31 July 2011
Skyfall," Good action flick, but hardly a masterpiece
","I'm not a Bond fan, but I did like Casino Royale quite a bit (the less said about Quantum of Solace, the better). Skyfall got reviews like you wouldn't believe, far surpassing anything in this series before, so I was excited to see it. It is, I must say, pretty good, though the praise seems a tad ridiculous. It's good for a Bond flick. It's nothing special beyond that. In fact, I think I liked Casino Royale better (neither is a film I'd ever bother rewatching). Skyfall is very entertaining, but there's nothing here putting it above the average blockbuster. The story is thin and rather silly, all kinds of clichés are hit upon and there are plenty of completely unbelievable stunts. Laughable moments include Bond using a terrible CGI Komodo dragon as a step-stool and characters desperately trying to escape the bad guys flipping around a flashlight in the darkness like a homing beacon. Javier Bardem gives another good baddie performance, though he comes off as kind of a Batman villain here - he's able to convince hundreds of faceless henchmen to die for his very personal cause for, I don't know, money, I guess. I hope their families got paid, anyway. I seem pretty negative, but it's only because I think it's overrated, not bad. One thing I absolutely loved was the look. Filmed by Roger Deakins, it is one of the most beautiful blockbusters I can think of.",7,2,7,16 December 2012
The Hangover," It's okay, but if you've been bombarded by the ads you've mostly already seen it
","I was wary of seeing this, because I've really disliked Todd Phillips previous films, which include Starsky & Hutch and Old School. I just find them tremendously poorly written and directed. And, yes, that does matter, even in a comedy. Timing is everything, and Phillips hasn't any timing. The reason I did go see this movie is for one of its actors, Zach Galifanakis, one of the funniest comedians of today. Bonus points for Ed Helms, who was probably the best of his generation of Daily Show correspondents. Galifanakis is one of the most oddball guys around, with a low-key style that's definitely a breath of fresh air in an industry now lead by Dane Cook. So does he overcome Phillips general horribleness? Yes. Well, he does. He runs away with the movie without trying. The movie doesn't triumph in the end, though. I have to admit, that's due a lot to the fact that the ads for this film have been relentless. The first trailer gives away about 70% of the movie's best jokes. And I was watching The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien most of Friday morning on Hulu, and the ads there filled me in on about 15% more of the jokes. So, yeah, they gave away about 90% of the jokes in the ads. And of the remaining 10%, there's only maybe one gag that floored me. This movie will definitely play best to those who haven't heard anything about it. Trying to judge it objectively, as if I hadn't seen all the ads, I'd still say that a ton of jokes fall flat anyway. Like I said, timing, and Phillips doesn't have any. He likes to continue on for too long a lot of the time. I also greatly disliked the movie's lead, Bradley Cooper. I guess it's not too big of a problem, as Galifanakas is never upstaged by him. Nor is Helms, even if he doesn't get the best material. Cooper is there, I think, to draw in women. He's the kind of guy women love and men hate. In short, he's great looking, but a total jerk. The film tries to play him off as a semi-sensitive man when all is said and done, but I never bought it.",6,4,12,7 June 2009
Stop-Loss," Too many clichés, but it's hard not to be moved
","The long-absent director of Boys Don't Cry returns with her sophomore feature, an Iraq War drama. Ryan Phillipe plays a Texan who returns home from a terrible tour in Iraq to find that the Army has 'stop-lossed' him, meaning they have re-recruited him, though he was supposed to get out of the service. He decides to run and try to fight it. Channing Tatum and Joseph Gordon-Levitt play two of his buddies who fought beside him and also live in the same small town. Truth be told, I wanted to see this movie mostly for Gordon-Levitt, and he delivers the best performance in the film. Phillipe is good, too, but he does not affect a very good Texas accent, which gets annoying. The film is unfortunately created pretty much entirely from clichés. Think 'redneck soldiers' and you can write a lot of the scenes yourself. Plenty of scenes where guys in cowboy hats and boots shoot at stuff with shotguns from the back of pickup trucks. And we get the old Vietnam vet cliché of the guys mistaking Texas reality for the horrors of war, complete with echoes of gunfire and helicopters in the background. It also suffers from MTV-style editing, and, in fact, it was produced by MTV, which is a difficult stigma to overcome. The opening sequence in Iraq, which haunts Phillipe for the rest of the film, is edited too much like an action sequence, in that it's meant to elicit feelings of excitement rather than horror. Peirce has said in interviews that she was influenced by the videos real soldiers were making in Iraq, and it's kind of unfair to dismiss this kind of film-making. These soldiers, after all, are certainly influenced by MTV themselves. Still, the MTV aesthetic always tends to make things seem plastic and distanced. It might be true that the soldiers' videos are a way for them to distance themselves from reality, although that's getting away from any subject the film itself wants to explore. But, even with the clichés and the bad film-making, the film ends up succeeding, at least a little. It brings to light the whole stop-loss issue, which is not discussed enough in the media (it is, as the film says, just a back-door draft), and it gets the audience to think about what is happening to soldiers and to empathize with them. I'm sure we all say we have great empathy for their situation, but, those who don't know anybody who is fighting this war don't ever have to deal with it on an emotional level. Even when we watch the news, we tend to engage with it in a more intellectual manner than we would with a story. And I think it is partly because most of us in the voting populace dealt with the Iraq War mostly on an intellectual level that we were never able to prevent it or bring it to a close.",7,11,22,30 March 2008
Minority Report," Good, but very, very flawed
","Steven Spielberg has made a couple of clunkers in his career, that's for sure. When sitting through Hook or The Lost World: Jurassic Park II, it's difficult to believe that the same man who made Jaws or E.T. or Close Encounters had a hand in them. Most of Spielberg's output, though, has been fantastic. Despite the occasional 1941, his films, even when flawed, soar above the average film. Minority Report falls into the category of fantastic and soaring, yet deeply flawed.Minority Report is, above all else, an enormously entertaining film. I personally like actioners and thrillers and sci-fi, and Minority Report fits well into all these categories. There are a couple of action set pieces that are simply amazing, like the chase through the car factory or the spider scene. Unfortunately, in the idea department, the film is kind of a dud. Critics have immediately pointed to the politics of today to show how prescient Minority Report is, but no matter how large and powerful the intelligence industry gets I seriously don't believe that we'll ever live in a world where, even if it were possible to predict crime, law enforcement could arrest someone for a crime they were about to commit. And then, without a trial, apparently, they not only imprison the pre-perpetrators, but they encase them in suspended animation goo, apparently forever. At least they never say whether these prisoners are ever to be released. I mean, what happened to correctional institutions! And, what's worse, almost every perpetrator chooses to murder for reasons of passion since everyone knows that it's impossible to commit premeditated murder. That means that a man who was about to stab his wife and her lover with a pair of scissors - a horrific but understandable crime - is doomed to never see the light of day again (apparently). And I haven't even mentioned the time frame: this story takes place in just over 50 years from now. It specifically states that the ACLU still exists. Perhaps if the film took place a hundred and fifty years from now and the ACLU had been disbanded or something (with some heavy explanations in that department), I may have bought the story. The screenwriters never come close to making the situation believable.And even if it weren't so unbelievable, the film has dozens of flaws besides that, and several poor, not very well thought out scenes. For example, the crimes are predicted by three psychics whose origins are dubiously explained. Part of the plot of the film is that this Pre-Crime department is supposed to expand nation-wide. The three pre-cogs are supposed to be the only ones alive, so where are they going to get others to predict the murders of every other city in the United States? These three only cover Washington D.C. I assume they aren't going to now cover the entire country (and soon, the world!). Okay, so maybe more exist. Perhaps I misunderstood that part of the exposition (which is generally very bad in this film). But if these three cover a populace only as big as the capital, they're going to need hundreds if not thousands of pre-cogs, and the three that they show in the movie seem to be so important and irreplaceable that the logistics of the project seem completely unfeasible. Then there's a scene where Tom Cruise kidnaps one of the pre-cogs to help him avoid the murder that he is accused of having been about to commit. First of all, you must know that the three pre-cogs are kept in a sort of sensory-deprivation chamber where they are suspended in a vat of liquid nutrients that is supposed to foster their psychic abilities. So Cruise kidnaps Agatha the pre-cog and escapes from the authorities in a ridiculous manner (there's apparently a drain in the bottom of the pool big enough for two people to slide down; the Pre-Crime division must have a hell of a time preventing the pre-cogs from accidentally being flushed in the first place!). Agatha, for the first time in a long while, begins to exist in the present. Then there's this scene in the mall, where she is able to protect Cruise by predicting every second of what's going to happen. She couldn't even do anything near this in the nutrient bath, and even there she could only see one thing: murders; but outside of it she sees every single thing that's ever going to happen. It just doesn't make any sense. And then there are the poorly calculated scenes. The scene with Peter Stormare (Fargo) as a black market surgeon makes little sense. It's completely ridiculous and also rather foul. The writers set up a whole history for this character, but don't follow up on it at all. And Cruise's whole backstory is very lame. Has every single individual who works for any law enforcement body had a child or wife who was murdered?
All the good stuff in Minority Report is technical. It's often beautifully done. Spielberg's direction is often fantastic. The set designs are miraculous - it would be insulting if it didn't get nominated for an Oscar in this department - as is the cinematography (a very beautiful, bleached look). The acting I would rate as merely adequate. Tom Cruise's character is not developed well enough, and therefore the performance isn't anything special. Max von Sydow, as nice as it is to see him in a summer blockbuster, has a very stereotypical role. Tim Blake Nelson (O Brother, Where Art Thou?), as Gideon, the warden of all the criminal tubes, should have been axed. Nelson is totally wrong for the movie. The only great performance in the film comes from Samantha Morton, who plays Agatha. She is amazing at times.Many critics have praised this, saying that it's a great rebound after the failure of A.I. That's so incredibly insulting. A.I. is by far the superior of the two. Overall, Minority Report is a fun movie when you're watching it, but the more I think about it, the more my opinion shrinks. I give it a 7/10. Good entertainment, far too many flaws to even count. I think I could go on for days pointing them out.",7,9,16,18 July 2002
Lifeboat," Tallulah Bankhead is TERRIBLE!!!
","I can't believe that so many people thought Tallulah Bankhead was great in her role in Lifeboat. In my opinion, she drags down what could have been one of Hitchcock's greatest masterpieces. She chews up every scene with her over-the-top acting style. It becomes tiresome instantly. Her character is by far the least compelling of the group. I know Hitch made the film for her, more than anything, but it would be interesting to see someone remake this film and subtract that character. Why remake Psycho? It's perfect. Remake one that is somewhat flawed. The rest of the cast is outstanding, however. I love Hume Cronyn. He's also great in Hitch's Shadow of a Doubt, and, of course, everything else he was ever in. I am not familiar with most of the other actors, but they're all great. Besides acting, Lifeboat is one of Hitch's most interesting films in every aspect. First off, it is historically interesting. For one thing, there is an ad at the very end of the film telling you to buy war bonds in the lobby! If you've read the Truffaut interview book, Hitch explains how angry Americans grew over this film because of its depiction of the German vs the depiction of the Allies. This film is actually incredibly brave in this way. It definitely is not anti-Ally in any way, as some interpreted when the film was first released. There are plenty of references to the inhumanity of the Germans and just a lot of general enemy-bashing. But the film also criticizes aspects of our culture, especially materialism. In the best scene of the film, the Allies form a mob, or a pack of wolves, as Hitch himself has said, and kill their enemy. It is an incredibly great moment. The ending is also one of Hitch's most complex, although he was especially gifted for creating incredible endings. Anyhow, see this film, even if you are not a Hitch fan. It is in no way his standard fare (the typical Hitchcock film being, in my thought, Ti Catch a Thief). 8/10, -2 for Tallulah Bankhead's mega-ego and terrible performance.",8,4,17,14 December 2000
In Bruges," Exceptional!
","This is McDonagh's first feature, and it's a sure bet that he's a writer/director to watch in the future. In Bruges was advertised as a straight comedy featuring gangsters who like to shoot at each other, so the three-dimensional characters and emotional depth come as a nice surprise. Colin Farrell, who, if he hadn't already convinced me he was a great actor, certainly wins that title now, stars as a green hit-man with a short attention span who messes up his first job by killing an innocent bystander. Things seem to be okay with the boss (Ralph Fiennes), who sends Farrell and his partner, Brendan Gleeson, to the beautiful Belgian town of Bruges to wait for their next instructions. The fact is, Fiennes plans for Gleeson to snuff out Farrell. That's the basic set-up, and it would be criminal to reveal too much more. McDonagh's script is a thing of beauty, quick-witted, smart and frequently touching. I did think that the final twists were a bit overly clever. Jordan Prentice, who plays the dwarf Jimmy in the film, began his career as one of several dwarfs inhabiting the Howard the Duck costume in the film of the same name.",9,4,10,20 July 2008
Kung Fu Panda," I suppose it's wrong to compare it to Pixar's work, but it is a decent little flick
","Decent animated entertainment from Dreamworks, the poor man's Pixar. Except for Shrek, which I despised, Dreamworks' animated films have been rather enjoyable, if unremarkable, and Kung Fu Panda continues this trend. Jack Black voices Po, a fat, clumsy panda who dreams of kung fu while working in a noodle shop. One day, he is chosen by a kung fu master to be the next dragon warrior, the one who will defeat über-villain Tai Lung (Ian McShane). Will he embarrass himself, or will at some point realize that, if he believes in himself, he can accomplish anything? Only the stupidest children can't figure that one out. Other voices are provided by Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, Seth Rogen, David Cross, and Michael Clark Duncan. Jesus. Just think about how much money Dreamworks wasted on all these people. Jackie Chan, for instance, has possibly one line in the entire movie, and probably made a million dollars for it. The movie itself is enjoyable, especially during the action sequences, which go by a little too fast but are well choreographed. The storyboarders had their work cut out for them. The artwork is probably the best looking Dreamworks has yet conceived, but compare it to the visionary WALL-E and it's clear that this studio is just for kids.",7,0,0,9 November 2008
To Be or Not to Be," Good flick, but a little uneven; 7/10
","To Be or Not to Be is an interesting WWII era film about actors in Poland who lead a resistance against the invading Nazis. It is mostly a comedy, but there is a dramatic side to the proceedings. The acting is good, especially Jack Benny. Most of the rest of the actors don't do anything particularly special, except for maybe Robert Stack. Unfortunately, as good as this film is, it has a difficult time reconciling its dramatic angle with its comedic angle. First of all, most WWII movies that were made in America during WWII are a little weak because the makers could only guess at what was really going on in Europe before the US entered the war. The best example of that is Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator. Chaplin himself said that he could have never made that film if he had known what was really going on. Ditto To Be or Not to Be. After having seen the atrocities which happened in Poland in a film like Schindler's List (although I believe the massacre I'm thinking of from that film happened in Krakow; I have not seen it for a long time) really ruins you for a film like this. However, even if it were not weakened by the actual history, the film still has problems reconciling. Robert Stack's role is never really resolved, for instance.",7,5,15,10 June 2001
Erin Brockovich," Hard to recommend...
","I think Steven Soderbergh has grown to be a very great director, one of the best living Americans in the business. I loved Out of Sight, and The Limey was really great, too. Traffic was also quite good. Now, only a couple of nights after seeing Traffic in the theater, I got to watch Erin Brockovich. Unfortunately, it was not great. I didn't really expect all that much while watching. I had heard from numerous people that Soderbergh did it just so he could make movies that he preferred to make. I don't think that that attitude is bad. If a good director has to sell out a little in order to make a great film, I say go ahead.Now Erin Brockovich isn't anywhere near a complete failure. There's a lot to like about the film. Its main problem is its extremely formulaic story (I thought Traffic had a formulaic story, too, but not on this level). Also, the fact that the action becomes repetitive is no help. At first, Brockovich's shtick (i.e., someone p***es her off (when it shouldn't, usually), so she becomes so angry at them that they eventually back off; this happens again and again and again in the film) is entertaining, albeit, not very believable (I did not feel too sorry when she is fired), but after the fifth time, the act becomes frustrating. This is especially true with the final scene, where Brockovich gets paid for a job well done. Tell me that you didn't see the joke coming from the second Albert Finney enters the room.So let us talk about acting. First, Aaron Eckhart's gentle Harley dude: I like Eckhart in Neal LaBute's films, In the Company of Men and Your Friends and Neighbors, but I don't know if he works here. Maybe it's not him in particular, but the script. His character is kind of boring. He's not well developed, and he is never interesting. In fact, I think Brockovich's whole domestic situation gets kind of boring as the narrative moves more towards the lawsuit (it begins quite compellingly). The scenes with Eckhart and the Brockovich children are almost all very cliche. None ring true, at least for me. The meet-cute between Brockovich and George (Eckhart) is quite irritating.Albert Finney: he is quite good in a pretty poorly written role. His character is not complex, but Finney manages to bring energy into the role. I liked him, and if this film is considered for some Oscars, which I doubt it will receive (except for maybe Roberts' role), Finney probably deserves a nomination for Best Supporting Actor.Now for Julia Roberts. To speak the truth, I think Pretty Woman is the only other movie I've ever seen her in. I try to avoid her movies. She is so unbelievably beautiful that it is difficult to take her acting seriously at times. And herein lies the difficulty of my rating her performance. I could never take my eyes off of her (and it was not her breasts at all, as others have claimed that they were a great distraction, but rather her face, her lips, her eyes especially). I think Roberts did a pretty good job in the quieter moments of the film. The best scene of the film is when George tells Erin about her youngest child's first words, spoken while she was working. There, I can see that Roberts can act. Also, when she is lying to her children about having eaten near the beginning of the film. She's quite good there, too. And there are plenty of very good scenes where Brockovich forms relationships with her clients, and this becomes quite touching. The problem elsewhere is that Brockovich is written over the top. First off, she is written as if she were a Saint, or at least a Pope, since she seems to be infallible. We as the audience are lead to identify with her at every point, even when she is obviously being rude or cruel for no reason, or just when she behaves stupidly. This is being too kind to Erin Brockovich as a real person, and thus it becomes difficult to take her character or the film seriously. When she would flip out, I would begin to hate her. Her attitude ceases being funny very quickly and just becomes tiring. But I say, although my own heart is with Bjork (Dancer in the Dark), just give Roberts the Best Actress Oscar. Then she will have won one, and she won't have to do serious movies anymore. This film was, after all, produced basically to get Julia Roberts and Oscar.Soderbergh does three things worth note in this Hollywood: he uses plenty of jump cuts, by which an American audience would normally be disturbed. They are mild, and perhaps they serve to teach the regular moviegoing population about their purpose. Also, it is filmed entirely with a handheld camera. This is good for the same reason that jump cuts are good. And, most thankfully, the musical score is very underplayed, which is rare in dramas nowadays. There is a very good scene near the end when Brockovich tells a sick woman how much money she has won in the lawsuit. Usually, this scene would have been overwhelmed with musical score. But here, there is no music. That is wonderful. It is not missed at all. The only thing we have to suffer through is a terrible Cheryl Crow pop song attached to the end credits, almost certainly shoved in by execs.This film I give a 6/10. Decent, though it could have been more. It did not offend my sensibilities for the most part.",6,2,5,8 January 2001
Unbreakable," a good follow-up to the smash hit The Sixth Sense
","MAJOR SPOILERSThe fundamental flaw of Unbreakable is that Shyamalan clings tenaciously to the structure, pace, themes, characters and mood of The Sixth Sense. That film was the surprise blockbuster in August of 1999, so it only makes (financial) sense for him to emulate it, and the studio to approve it. Alas, although Unbreakable made a large chunk of money at the box office, that success was far below analysts' estimates and was technically a flop.
I had planned on seeing it, but a couple of friends had told me that it wasn't as good as The Sixth Sense. One friend told me that it was the worst major motion picture that he had ever seen and begged me to swear an oath never to see it. I told him that, just based on the artistic success of The Sixth Sense, I had to see it no matter how bad it was. I promised I wouldn't 'waste my money' at the theater and waited until it came out on DVD. Heck, I didn't even rent it myself, but watched it after my brother had rented it.
And I found it rather good. Like I said, its major flaw is that it wants to be a second The Sixth Sense in every way. I wish the style would have been altered a bit. I would have especially liked it more if it were not so self-serious, for, unlike The Sixth Sense, which was easier to take seriously (my imagination can accept ghosts without much problem), Unbreakable is about the real-life existence of an invincible man, a super hero. I may have liked it even more if it were a bit more clever about its absurd reality. David (Bruce Willis) is an ordinary man, and his burgeoning super-hero identity is interesting to watch. It gives his character layers. However, Mr. Glass (Sam Jackson) is such an eccentric individual that it is hard to accept him in the sort of realistic setting Shyamalan puts him in.
I'd like to talk about the 'surprise ending' in this paragraph. This is another misstep of sorts for the film. I think that the surprise ending of The Sixth Sense both clinched its success and harmed the artistic integrity of the film. Most of the audience couldn't give a damn about artistic integrity, let alone plain old integrity, and most of them rushed home to tell all their friends that they never saw that surprise coming and that they have to go see it again to figure out what they missed the first time. I knew a lot of people who thought that that film was bad on subsequent viewings. That is because, despite the makeup of the audience (and despite the presence of Bruce Willis), The Sixth Sense was actually an art film. It was very slow-moving compared to your average blockbuster (consider the only film that beat it in the b.o. that year: Star Wars, Episode One: The Phantom Menace), and the focus was on the characters and their relationships. In Unbreakable, unlike in The Sixth Sense, the surprise ending is so clearly telegraphed that you would have to be completely not paying attention to miss it. However, I did not disapprove of it as much as I did the ending of The Sixth Sense. Unlike that ending, it doesn't force you to go back over everything. That film even had a montage sequence showing earlier scenes. In fact, I was sort of disappointed at the loss of an excellent opportunity with the ending Shyamalan chose. It is sort of like Primal Fear, where Richard Gere stumbles outside, dumbfounded. What I think should have been done here was to actually elevate it to the level of a comic book, actually make Mr. Glass a real super villain. It's as if Shyamalan had no clue what to do here. And all I've talked about was the story. Shyamalan more than proves his worth as a director. His style is perhaps even more polished here than it was in The Sixth Sense. I really loved how he did the climactic sequence, especially the scene where David fell into a pool. I hope that he'll stop trying to ape his one hit and move onto more original projects. Lord knows he has the talent. 7/10",7,0,0,29 June 2001
Star Trek," Star Trek for people who don't like Star Trek. Basically, it's Star Wars.
","The Star Trek the Trekkies have been fearing since this was announced: a dumbed-down Star Wars clone. As such, it's okay. It's a fairly entertaining space opera. It's fast paced and exciting. What it isn't is Star Trek. Star Trek is about man encountering the unknown and dealing with it with science and philosophy. There is weird stuff going on in this one - time travel, in particular, which in the original series was discovered early on and which served as the basis for many episodes and a couple of the movies - but the situation is urgent and the characters have no time to think about anything. It's just rush rush rush. The film does get most of the characters right, thankfully. Except for one instance, which I'll discuss shortly, the casting is brilliant. Zacahry Quinto in particular makes a perfect Spock, and I absolutely loved Simon Pegg as Scotty. Likewise, John Cho of the Harold & Kumar movies was a great choice for Sulu. Chekov doesn't belong, of course, because he wasn't on the Enterprise until later, but they got that wrong in The Wrath of Khan, too, so I guess I can't complain too much. The one exception to the excellent cast is Chris Pine as Kirk. He's excruciatingly bad. I'm certainly not asking him to impersonate Shatner - God no. But he doesn't capture any of Kirk's intelligence, or even charm. He's not quite as bad as, say, Hayden Christensen in the Star Wars prequels, but he's in the same category. He's just a brash youngster whom you certainly wouldn't want captaining a vessel. The movie spends a heck of a lot of time showing how cool he is. Even when he's doing something smart, like outsmarting the Kobayashi Maru program, they never really depict him as being smart. We don't see him changing the program, as he infamously did, and it never feels like he believably could. There's some fun to be had here, but only dumb fun. Maybe they'll improve the formula some in the inevitable sequel. I'll definitely give it at least one more chance (the series that is; I have no desire to rewatch this film).",7,34,70,15 May 2009
Fury," Holy crap, this is cool! *high fives frat brother*
","More dudebro j.o. material from director David Ayer, given an air of respectability by its WWII subject matter. Really, it could have just as easily been the third G.I. Joe movie. Or maybe not. It's far more violent than that. You can really tell Ayer is getting off on the violence. He films it so lovingly, trying to pass it off as 'the horrors of war.' Yes, I'm sure war was this awful, but you're rolling around in it, dude. Brad Pitt stars as the commander of a tank crew. Logan Lerman stars as his new recruit - for many years now, Pitt hasn't lost a man, but now he finally has and Lerman is the unfortunate replacement (as Lerman arrives at the assignment, he's forced to peel the old guy's face off the inside of the tank). Shia LaBeouf, Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal round out the tank crew. Lerman is a newbie, and when he bitches out during the first big action sequence, the other men, who are already mean to him, are forced to make him a man by having him execute a P.O.W. and then get him laid. The action sequences are pretty good, truth be told, but this is WWII from the point of view of someone who's a big fan of Call of Duty, not from someone who has anything to say. The acting is acceptable, but nothing special.",4,3,10,1 December 2014
Akira," This film should be taken more seriously
","Too often, Akira is thought of as the typical anime. It's thought to be action, gore, and nudity packed. I think far too few viewers see the enormous amount of detail the writers put into their characters. These characters are very well developed. I think the conflict between Tetsuo and Kaneda is a very compelling one. How many of us can sympathize with Tetsuo? I'm sure nearly all of us can. He lives his life as a cronie, a short and insubstantial punk whose friends treat him like a joke. Then he gets these super powers, and like so many, he lets his power control him.
Kaneda begins the film as just a punk, but as the film progresses, he realizes that only he has the power to help. He thinks, and I can see him think in the film. It's all very well done.I also love the three children with super powers (I don't recall their names). Their situation, along with Akira's, is very tragic and quite affecting. The most impressive scene in the film, where these three accost Tetsuo as giant toys, is among the best scenes in film.
The only problem with this film is that it can be overly complicated at times. It took two viewings to understand Tetsuo's past (and I'm still not entirely sure that I got everything). anyhow, 9/10, a near masterpiece. Much better than the derivative American film The Matrix, of which Akira was a precursor (and the filmmakers have admitted to having seen and loved it).",10,3,7,16 March 2000
Akira," Upon the fourth viewing
","I have already written a review for this film, written after the second time I saw it (actually, a long time after my second viewing); I suggested a different way of looking at it, an approach more directed at the human aspects of this film (explored even further later in this review), and handed it a 9/10. It's greatest flaw, I stated, was that its story was far too complicated and difficult for its own good. Although by the second time I had understood it a lot more than the first time, many parts were still undecipherable. On my third viewing, on the new Pioneer Special Edition DVD (VERY highly suggested; you can't get the edition with the collector's tin anymore, but a plastic, and actually a better box is still available), I finally got to see it in widescreen and finally in Japanese. The Japanese (or the subtitles rather, since I don't speak the language) reveals more of the political level of the story. On my fourth viewing, the first one when I watched it entirely alone, I connected the story a little better, but many questions were still unanswered. But now my attitude is this: who cares?Few doubt its visual mastery; only Princess Mononoke is comparable in the level of detail. I would say that Akira is still, even compared to Mononoke, on a level all its own. It's something that most people tend to look over when they're examining animation, but the techniques of the direction are actually highly developed. The techniques of direction in animation are still far behind those of live action film because the medium is not taken seriously. The Japanese are solving this problem, but Akira is still its peak.I have previously talked about its more human side, trying to shut those up who accuse it of being nothing but spectacle. Here, too, comparing it with Mononoke, which stands as the most universally liked anime film in America (despite what Disney thinks; btw, if you think I'm ragging on Mononoke Hime, I do love it. Check out my user comment on it, although I don't quite like it as much as I did upon my first viewing), I think the emotional and human values of Akira are greater. There has been a constant fuss about the ambiguity of Mononoke's characters. 'There're no good guys or bad guys,' is a popular phrase that I think even I used to describe the characters in the film. If there are no purely good guys, then what is Ashitaka, for instance? Akira's characters are actually much more ambiguous. I bizarrely chose to compare Ashitaka with Travis Bickle, the crazy taxi driver from, well, Taxi Driver in describing how complex I felt his character was. I'm embarrassed that I said such a silly thing; not that Ashitaka, despite his good- guy ethics, isn't a complex character; it's just that comparing him with Travis Bickle implies something that it oughtn't to. Now Tetsuo can be fairly compared with Travis Bickle. As Roger Ebert once said about Bickle, Taxi Driver is a great film because we can all identify with Bickle, even if we would never go as far as he did.Tetsuo is the same way: there is an enormous amount of pathos in that character. Caneda is just as well developed. To see just how well written this script is, follow Caneda's developement throughout the film. He is not the same person at the end. Kaori, Yamagata, Kai, the Colonel, Masaru, Kiyoko, and Takashi have quite a bit of depth, too. Perhaps the only characters who come off a little thin are Kei and Ryu; this is because of the difficulties the screenwriters had in developing that particular aspect of the film, the revolution. I'm not sure, for instance, why they were smuggling Takashi away at the film's beginning. Maybe a fifth viewing will reveal more of those aspects. Of course, the politics are only supposed to be working as the background to the struggle between Tetsuo and Kaneda.On this fourth viewing, Akira reveals itself to be one of the best science fiction movies ever made, one of the best Japanese movies I've ever seen, maybe the best (and I have seen a lot), and easily the best animated film I've ever seen. It also stands now, in my opinion, as one of the greatest masterpieces in cinema.

The Maze Runner," Some big problems, but it's pretty entertaining
","The newest YA fantasy adaptation, I went to see this because, one, I hadn't seen a movie in theaters for about a month now and, two, because the trailer set up an intriguing enough mystery that it got me interested. A bunch of teen boys awake without memory to find themselves prisoners in a small glade surrounded by gigantic walls. Beyond the walls lies a maze, and when the doors to the maze close at night, monsters come out of the wall to kill anyone who has remained in the maze. The boys believe there may be an escape in the maze, but are unable to find it as they search throughout the day. When a new kid (Dylan O'Brien) arrives, he is a bit braver than the rest and enters the maze at night, which ends up changing all the rules of the boys' society. This movie offers a bit of fun and excitement, for sure. There are more questions raised than answered, and there seem to me to be some fairly big plot holes. The characters aren't particularly well developed, and, as it moves towards its conclusion (as much as it has one - of course it's a series of novels), it kind of reveals itself to be much closer to The Hunger Games than you might have originally thought. But I did enjoy myself, and I'd recommend it if you like these kinds of movies. It'll play well enough on video.",7,0,1,21 September 2014
Memento," Truly, utterly brilliant
","I had grave doubts going into this one. Its fans seemed to me to be the same people who like a lot of the movies I really hated over the past five years or so, movies like The Matrix, Run Lola Run, Fight Club, and many others. I avoided it for a long time, though I always thought I had to see it no matter what. And when the chance to see it for free came along, I jumped at it. Fortunately, Memento lives up to the hype. It's one of the few movies that can. Seriously, I wouldn't doubt that this movie will one day be counted as one of the best ever made. Perhaps not the ninth best ever, its current position on the imdb top 250, but it will certainly have its place in the history books.The main reason for this is its unique narrative structure. Add this one to the ranks of Citizen Kane for its high level of narrative innovation. What it does is it tells its story backwards. It will give us one large chunk of narrative information, stop, and then rewind to the last place Leonard (Guy Pearce) began his small chunk of memory. You see, Leonard has this condition where he has little short-term memory. After a few minutes, he forgets everything that has happened to him since a serious injury. He reminds himself of his purpose every time he wakes up in a new chunk of memory through hosts of photos and notes that he has written to himself. His purpose: to avenge his dead wife. She was raped, and her rapist knocked poor Lenny on his head. This condition, which is the foundation of the narrative structure, is clearly false. You just have to suspend your disbelief as you watch, and, I promise you, you'll see something very unique.The best thing about this film is that it gives you some real mental exercise. It asks you to remember a large amount of information. Add to that the fact that not everything is trustworthy, and that truth and memory and facts and everything that we take for granted are constantly being questioned and warped, and you've got yourself an enjoyable uphill battle.
The rest of the film is equally commendable, which ought to be remembered as long as you can retain it. The acting is quite good, especially Joe Pantoliano, so good in Bound, and Carrie-Anne Moss, with whom I was quite unimpressed in The Matrix. Here, she shows that she can play a complex character and that her main assets aren't her T&A. Guy Pearce is also quite good, though he was perhaps better in L.A. Confidential. I think someone else might have brought a bit more depth to the part, but perhaps not. One of the most difficult things about his role is the fact that he really has no complexities - he's a blank slate. One could honestly call him simply a tool of the plot. However, someone who would say that would be missing the fact that he is often being used as a tool by other characters. Christopher Nolan is not just a master scenarist, he's also an excellent director. Also great is the cinematography, sharp color with some spatterings of black and white.Perhaps there are some plot holes, but I didn't notice them. This is truly a masterpiece, a film to remember. 10/10.",9,4,9,25 November 2001
Coraline," Gorgeous and frightening
","Every bit as good as Henry Selick's masterpiece, The Nightmare Before Christmas. Like that one, the film finds a perfect balance between beautiful and creepy. I would describe it as a children's horror film. In fact, I think this might go down as one of the scariest children's films ever made. The story is about a young girl, Coraline, who finds an odd doorway in her new house that leads to a mirror-image world, where her parents pay attention to her and give her anything she wants. It's wonderful, but odd Â– everyone has black buttons for eyeballs. Coraline's first few trips to the alternate world are fun, but soon her 'other mother' insists that she get her own buttons. The story is familiar. It reminded me a lot of Pan's Labyrinth and Spirited Away. The plot also takes a couple of obvious shortcuts that don't make a lot of sense. Fortunately, these things are hard to notice when you're watching Selick's eye-popping design. Pixar's got its work cut out for it if it wants to win Best Animated Film at next year's Oscar ceremony. It also has one of the most amazing musical scores I've heard in a while, by Bruno Coulais.",10,0,1,8 February 2009
Shakespeare in Love," Overrated? Heck, it's terribly Underrated!
","I can't believe somebody could rent this movie and find it to be a bad film. I didn't see it until a day or two after it won Best Picture, but when I did, I smiled and affirmed that they had picked the best film of the year. A year, I will remind you, that in July it already seemed that Saving Private Ryan would certainly and very unfairly win itself the Best Picture award plus 10 more. The fact that so many people felt that Shakespeare in Love robbed SPR of its Oscars proves further just how sad this country is. People are extremely easily won over by cheap sentiment and commercials which tell us that SPR was 'deep.' SIL's Oscars were blamed on the Academy's forgetfulness.Truth be told, that is exactly why SIL won and SPR lost. A film came along that impressed them late in the game, and that clinched the award. Plus, it was pushed up by Miramax's soft money campaign. Heck, if SIL didn't exist, Miramax would have tried its hardest to get Life is Beautiful that Best Picture Oscar. It would have even had a chance, a foreign film. No, if indeed SPR had come around in, say, October, it would have certainly won the Best Picture Oscar. Why? Well, look back to the 1998 awards show, where Titanic took everything and its mother. Very few people would affirm that Titanic was a worthwhile Best Picture. I don't know about you, but I was pretty embarassed to be an American after I aw Titanic (of course, afterwards, it swept the entire world, so I guess it's just our species). Titanic was sappy and obvious with its meanings and emotions, as was SPR. It would have won if not for their forgetfulness. Luckily, SIL conquered it.Okay, the reason I like this film so much: it is extraordinarily well written and it has everything. Let's start with the everything notion right away: action, romance, comedy and drama. All of those are here in full force. It was perfect in all those aspects. Now, for the great writing, which many people are apparently missing:to adapt a play as great as Romeo and Juliette and make it even more compelling than the original is a feat that almost no one can achieve. More compelling? Did I actually say that?!?!?!?! SACRILEGE! No, I truly believe that the play garners more meaning as we see it develop throughout SIL. We see Shakespeare's inspirations to write the play, we see him lovingly rehearse lines from the play with the woman whom he loves. Plus, in a developement so ingenious that it makes me clap, Viola, his love interest, is Romeo and Shakespeare is Juliette. It is just beautiful, and I have to give this movie a 10/10. It's terribly underrated, because I believe the idiots at the Academy, as well as a huge amount of cynical self-described film buffs have regretted its initial success. Some people will never know how good movies can get.",10,2,4,29 July 2000
This Is the End," Very funny
","I wouldn't be too surprised if this turned out to be the funniest movie of 2013. It's kind of shabbily plotted, and its final half hour is a tad weak, but who cares when it's as funny as it is. The concept is pretty brilliant: a bunch of dopey Hollywood actors (everyone playing caricatures of themselves) barricade themselves in James Franco's house during the Biblical apocalypse. The six who are left alive: Franco, Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill and Danny McBride. Tensions start to rise when McBride, the defacto villain, basically in full Kenny Powers mode, starts eating more than his share of food and wasting water. The film is at its funniest when the guys are just screwing around. At one point, when they're all bored out of their minds, the guys film an impromptu sequel to Pineapple Express. There are some pretty nifty, cheap-looking but fun special effects. The six main actors are all fantastically funny. It'd be hard to pick one out of any of them as the best (well, Baruchel kind of has the straight man role, so one might call him the least good, though he's still plenty funny). Michael Cera, who pops up at the party at the beginning of the film, might be the highlight playing a coke-snorting, woman molesting a-hole who gets his comeuppance in a particularly horrible way. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have built up a nice little career as writers (let's forget about The Green Hornet and The Watch). This is the first time they take the helm as directors, and they do a pretty good job. You definitely have to be a fan of these actors to like this movie, but if you are, you'll definitely enjoy yourself.",8,4,18,16 June 2013
Iron Man 2," I enjoyed this even more than the first
","I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this superhero sequel. I wonder, if I had seen the original in a better theater, would I have liked it as much as I did this one? I don't know. I've never had a desire to rewatch it and, as much as I enjoyed part 2, I'm not sure I'd ever rewatch it, either. But I'll be there for part 3. What most impressed me about this one is that they added a whole host of new elements, but didn't let them drag the film down by making it overlong or overcomplicated. The whole Avengers thing is deftly handled. I actually find that whole concept pretty funny, because it banks on the fact that all the other Marvel franchises are going to be just as successful as this one when we already know that they won't be (see the last Hulk movie - are they going to have to reboot it again in order to work it into the Avengers movie?). The Iron Man movies just have a lot of things going for them. First off, the cast is just amazing. Robert Downey Jr. is a big part of the success here. Gwyneth Paltrow, while not as good an actress as she was a decade ago, holds her own nicely opposite Downey. Don Cheadle replaces Terrence Howard as Lt. Col. James Rhodes. Both are strong performers, but, for sentimental reasons (i.e., Boogie Nights), I prefer Cheadle. The sequel adds Sam Rockwell as Tony Stark's chief rival. Mickey Rourke is a Russian physicist/gangster who comes after Stark. Sam Jackson is in the sequel a lot more (his only appearance in the original was post-credits). Scarlett Johansson plays a mysterious intern hired by Paltrow. She clearly has some secrets. And Jon Favreau himself is great as Stark's bodyguard (well, Iron Man doesn't really need a bodyguard, I suppose; maybe Happy Hogan is his assistant?). Favreau is a pretty good director. I especially like the way he integrates humor into the film without going overboard with it. Downey's subtle hilarity helps a lot in that respect, but there's a spirit of improv to a lot of the dialogue that's just a lot of fun. Justin Theroux, whom you may remember as an actor in Mulholland Dr., actually wrote the screenplay for the sequel (his only previous screenplay being Tropic Thunder, which netted Robert Downey Jr. an Oscar nomination), so he gets a lot of credit for keeping it all together. The film doesn't actually contain a ton of action sequences - only three really big ones (and they all deliver), so it's quite impressive how entertaining the film is from beginning to end.",8,0,3,9 May 2010
World War Z," The movie's okay, but I can't wait for Hollywood to give up on zombies
","An okay zombie movie. I think the film's main fault is that it does nothing new with the monster. These are basically the same zombies we saw in 28 Days/Weeks Later, except they kind of drop the whole virus angle fairly shortly in and just admit they're dealing with the undead. The plot has a U.N. operative (Brad Pitt) traversing the world trying to figure a way out of the crisis. Pitt is excellent. There are some fantastic set pieces, and the film moves extremely quickly. I'd call it more suspense than horror here - I do think the PG-13-ization hurts the film a bit. I'm not a huge gore guy, but the constant cutting away from any violence starts to get old after a while. I wonder if there'll be an R-rated director's cut on video - that might be a better film. The actual solution to the problem is pretty lame, and not especially believable. I must say, Marc Forster does a fine job here as director. After Quantum of Solace, no one in their right mind should have let him near an action movie again. He proves himself quite capable, though. I'd recommend this, though maybe not that strongly.",7,7,14,15 July 2013
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," A sweet and lovable delight
","Judd Apatow's latest production follows a formula similar to some of his other films, but it still works quite well. What Apatow and his crew bring to the table are more fully developed characters, an emotional core and a refreshingly adult sense of humor. Kids can have their Meet the Spartans; I'm perfectly happy with this. Jason Segel stars and wrote the screenplay. Kristen Bell is the actress who broke up with him. Russell Brand plays her new boyfriend and Mila Kunis the new girl whom Segel meets. Pretty predictable plot-wise, of course, but the laughs are frequent and I actually cared about the characters. It's great to see the film not resort to making Bell and Brand outright villains. They feel like genuine people. The real treat of the film is the wonderful supporting cast and their lovable characters, including Apatow mainstay Paul Rudd as a stoner surf instructor, Jonah Hill as a guy obsessed with Russell Brand's rock star character, Bill Hader as Segel's supportive step-brother and Jack McBrayer as a sexually frustrated newlywed (his wife played by Maria Thayer, who played Tammi Littlenut in Strangers with Candy). It's not the funniest movie I've ever seen, but it's quite satisfying.",9,3,8,21 April 2008
Zootopia," Smart, funny and beautifully animated
","Disney's latest animated feature is smart, funny and beautifully animated. It might look like your standard talking animal fare, but it has a lot going on, with some smart metaphors and a complex story. Zootopia is an enormous city full of anthropomorphic mammals who have evolved to live together in a cooperative society that consists of both predators and prey of every sort - they have long since given up on being enemies. Ginnifer Goodwin plays Judy Hopps, the first rabbit to make it onto the Zootopia police force - though all mammals have supposed equality, prejudices kind of rule their society, and such a small creature has never been able to be in such a position before. Judy is initially given simple duties, but she insists on being more and eventually finds her way into a major investigation of disappearing citizens. She teams up with a con artist fox (Jason Bateman), and the two search for clues. The film introduces a lot to think about; it definitely could get young ones considering things like prejudice, stereotypes and racism, and without ever seeming obvious or preachy. The characters are great and the animation wonderful. I did think the story resolves itself way too easily, like, at a certain point, the filmmakers either hit a wall and decided they had to take a shortcut to the end, or perhaps they were thinking a young audience would be getting bored so they just hand the protagonists the answer to hurry things along. The film still may be above younger audience members' heads - the smallest kids in my theater seemed to grow tired of it quickly. All in all, it's a good time and a fine addition to the Disney canon.",8,6,16,6 March 2016
The Impossible," Starts great, but the resolution is perhaps too easy
","This film starts off outstandingly, but kind of falls apart as it goes on. It's about a family vacationing in Thailand in Christmas of 2004. When the tsunami hits on Boxing Day, the family is separated. The mother (Naomi Watts) is gravely harmed. Her eldest son (Tom Holland) is with her. The father (Ewan MacGregor) is with the other two, younger sons, but he decides he must leave them with strangers while he searches for his wife and other son. The tsunami part is so harrowing that the rest of the film is bound to be at least a bit less interesting. At first, the fight for survival and frenzied searching is involving. Unfortunately, the final few sequences are fairly poor. First, for a father to leave his two youngest children, ages 7 and 5, with total strangers in a foreign country that has been devastated by absolute chaos seems truly bonkers. I sincerely hope that the film was just simplifying things and this guy in real life wasn't this stupid. Second, the big sequence where all separated members of the family find themselves at (or around) the same hospital and almost miss each other. The whole thing seems too cutesy, and also, in the end, way too easy. We're constantly reminded that everyone around this family is still desperately seeking their loved ones, many of whom we know have died, and these people find each other out of pure luck in what seems like less than 24 hours. In the end, it doesn't feel like these people suffered more than a minor inconvenience, especially when compared to what everyone else around them is going for. Really, this is the story of the luckiest family on the entire planet. There are plenty of good bits, though, even after the tsunami. I loved the long sequence where Tom Holland is trying to help other people who have lost their loved ones. Holland is really the MVP of the cast here. MacGregor and Watts are both good, but neither are award-worthy (Watts in particular is incapacitated through a large portion of the film, so I don't know why she got an Oscar nom for it).",6,2,5,13 January 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Surprisingly great given what I had heard
","It boggles my mind how down the critics were on this. It's at the same level as the first one, which everyone seemed to love. Yes, there are some things to complain about, mostly that there's just way too much going on. Characters from the first one that, if you last saw it when it was in the theaters (as I did), you won't remember pop up at regular intervals. There are several separate plot lines going on at the same time, and once in a while one character will be away on his or her own adventure for a long time and then come back to the main plot line without explaining where they've been or what they've been doing, and requiring no explanation for what has happened with all the other characters. But, really, so what? There's more than enough exposition elsewhere, and as long as the audience understands what's going on, it doesn't matter too much. The story may be overcomplicated, but it's generally very good. The bottom line is that the movie is a hell of a lot of fun. Of all the movies this summer, this is the one that doesn't disappoint at all. It's a thousand times better than Superman, that's for sure. Where Superman was slow and dull and ponderous, Pirates' action never stops (which I'm sure will annoy some) and it doesn't aspire to be anything more than a really fun ride. There're a lot of cool monsters, too. If you liked the first one, definitely don't miss this while it's still on the big screen.",9,3,8,17 July 2006
Argo," Certainly it's okay, but hardly one of the best films of 2012
","Kind of a big disappointment for me, though it's certainly a pretty good movie. Affleck's direction is excellent, it's beautifully shot and it feels like a really good film, but, honestly, I think the story is kind of thin and never very interesting. You can tell that the screenwriter had to add dozens of moments of fake tension to the real story to make it filmable. None of the characters really pop out as interesting people, and it'd be a shame if someone like Alan Arkin was nominated for an Oscar just for getting a couple of chuckles. Affleck himself probably gives the best performance in the film, but it's of a blank kind of person, a CIA spy who is meant to be that way. The movie's perfectly entertaining to watch, but it evaporates immediately. It'll certainly be the kind of movie the Oscars go for, but, I'm calling it right now, no way it wins Best Picture (it might very well, however, win the Best Adapted Screenplay award, though it's totally undeserving of even that).",7,1,2,11 November 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Extremely exciting
","I had several major problems with J.J. Abrams first Star Trek movie. Just briefly, my big three complaints: it's too action-oriented, where Star Trek is supposed to be a little more philosophical; it moves too fast; they've really screwed up the character of James T. Kirk, and Chris Pine is by far the weakest actor in the movie. The sequel, unfortunately, retains most of those problems. I guess, though, that I've just come to accept that this is what a J.J. Abrams Star Trek movie is going to be like. The fact is, I quite enjoyed this film. The one major improvement is Pine's acting. He definitely seems more comfortable in the role. All the other actors, as with the previous installment, are excellent, particularly Zachary Quinto as Spock. This one also has stronger, more memorable villains than the previous installment (it was Eric Bana, I remember, but I don't recall what his deal was). The pace here is, again, breathless, but, for the most part, it's really well plotted. The action sequences are gripping as Hell, and the character work is so excellent it's all really involving. I definitely recommend this if you're at all interested.",8,5,10,19 May 2013
Stripes," Shockingly bad. I can't fathom how people found this funny
","In some circles, this is considered a classic of 1980s comedy. I'm something of an aficionado of 80s comedies, having grown up in that decade (though admittedly 1981 is a bit early for me). I must say, this is no classic. It's a boring piece of crap. Bill Murray is somewhat charismatic as a bum who joins the Army along with his best friend, played by Harold Ramis. Together they lead a rag-tag group of losers under the command of Warren Oates (who died less than a year after this film was released). Among them are John Candy and Judge Reinhold. John Laroquette and Sean Young also appear. There's barely a laugh in the picture (Candy made me chuckle once in a great while), and the heroes are such unlikeable douches you almost can't wait to see them courtmartialed for their 'hilarious' antics (of course it ends with them receiving medals for actions which, I imagine, would have begun WWIII in 1981). Just awful.",4,12,21,29 April 2011
The English Patient," Underrated
","This movie has suffered from an undeserved Oscar backlash. It is truly a powerful film experience. The writing, direction, and acting are all perfect. All the passion of this film is overwhelming! What did this film do wrong to anger so many people? Was it the complexity of the characters and the situations that they were in? Was it some anti-British sentiment? No, I'm willing to bet that it is just plain stupidity. So get a life and watch this masterpiece again.",10,4,10,21 March 2000
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Really well done
","A shockingly intelligent, adult romantic comedy. Steve Carell, in his best film role, stars as a man whose wife (Julianne Moore) admits to having an affair. She also wants a divorce. After a couple of nights of loud whining at a bar, super-stud Ryan Gosling decides to teach Carell how to be a man - that is, pick up women. And it works! But that only seems to ruin Carell's life more in the long run. Meanwhile, Gosling, always the cool cat, falls for the one girl who is too smart for his schtick, Emma Stone. Stone is the best thing about the movie. She's so utterly charming and intelligent. She can elevate a mediocre movie like Easy A. In an already good movie like this one, she raises it to a whole other level whenever she's on screen. I also loved the subplot about Carell and Moore's son, Jonah Bobo, and his crush on his four years-older babysitter (Analeigh Tipton), who herself has a crush on Carell. The film also co-stars Marissa Tomei, Kevin Bacon, John Carroll Lynch and Beth Littleford (Carell's real-life wife). About the only thing I didn't like in the film: Stone's sassy Asian friend (Melissa Tang), who apparently has no sex life of her own. Apparently we've moved away from the gay best friend stereotype and moved into the Asian best friend. But besides that one tiny element, we really don't get that many comedies with this level of writing. It's a gem.",8,3,6,4 December 2011
Green Room," Fantastic thriller
","Jeremy Saulnier showed a ton of promise with his previous film, Blue Ruin, and his follow-up is even better. This is one of the tautest, nastiest thrillers in recent memory. If you like wincing at movies and watching them through your fingers, this is definitely for you! A nobody punk band calling themselves The Ain't Rights (Anton Yelchin, Alia Shawkat, Joe Cole and Callum Turner) is a long way from home and their 'tour' has hardly given them enough money to live, let alone buy gas (they siphon). A fan sets them up with a gig at a secret skinhead bar, and it would hardly be punk to turn such a thing down. They quickly find themselves over their heads when they witness a horrific crime and try to call the cops. Cops aren't welcome, and soon the band finds themselves locked up in the club's green room, along with the murder victim's best friend (Imogen Poots) awaiting probably murder. They're smart, though, and attempt a defense, but they're hopelessly outnumbered. Patrick Stewart plays the skinhead ringleader. Other recognizable actors include Macon Blair (star of Blue Ruin) and Mark Webber. It's always great to see real talent behind genre films, and I deeply hope Saulnier keeps it up.",9,14,31,7 May 2016
Public Enemies," Putrid
","Incredibly lousy gangster yarn. On a technical level, it's one of the worst releases I've ever seen. The film was shot on digital cameras that look like they were bought at Best Buy. It's murky and downright hideous to watch, dark as Hell with laughable, anachronistic hand-held camera work. The audio has a lot of problems, as well. That all might be tolerable if the movie was otherwise good, but it's far from it. Many critics have written that the film wants to de-mythologize the '30s gangster yarns. This film's idea of de-mythologizing John Dillinger (played by Johnny Depp) is to make him a complete bore. The actual story sets him up as a kind of tragic hero, so in no way does it actually try to 'de-mythologize'. It's all into the myth. The G-men are also de-glamorized, and likewise are completely boring. None of the actors bring much to the proceedings. Depp and Marion Cotillard are extremely boring as the central couple. None of the other gangsters pop out at you. If you gave me a line-up with all the gangster characters in the film, I couldn't tell you who the Hell was playing, say, Baby Face Nelson. It's pretty bad when Christian Bale gives the only halfway decent performance in your film. He brings the same methody crap to this one as he does to every movie, and is as bad as ever. But at least his character has a little bit of life to him, unlike everybody else in the movie. This was an absolute disaster. I'm not a big Mann fan, but he's made a few good to great movies. This is by far the worst he's ever put his name on.",4,0,0,24 January 2010
The Babadook," Might be one of the best horror films of recent years, except they felt the need to tell you up front exactly what was going to happen and what the central metaphor is
","A solid horror movie which was, for me, a little disappointing. I kept hearing it was the best horror flick in a long while, and I just can't agree. The set-up feels a little cliché, first off. The biggest flaw is that the central metaphor (and pretty much the whole plot) is laid out in such a hamfisted way, I was just watching it play out exactly the way they said it was going to. The monster, the Babadook, is a shadowy entity that's haunting a single mother and her poorly behaved six year-old son. Early in the film, the child finds a strange storybook and has his mother read it as a bedtime story - it's this book that tells us the whole story up front (more its second appearance a little while later than right away). As unsurprising as it, it's still fairly successful. There are plenty of nice chills to be had. Essie Davis, who plays the mother, is absolutely fantastic, actually giving one of the best performances of the year. The son, Noah Wiseman, well, let's just say you're going to want to strangle him from the outset. That's exactly the reaction Jennifer Kent wanted, and thus his casting is beyond perfect.",7,4,12,18 January 2015
Balls of Fury," God awful
","I can never wrap my head around the careers of Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant. On television, their work is some of the best comedy of the past couple of decades: The State, Viva Variety!, and, their triumph, Comedy Central's Reno 911. But when they write movies, the results are well nigh unwatchable. I had thought in the past that they were just defecating cheap movie scripts so that they could make money and continue producing fine work on television. I mean, The Pacifier, Herbie: Fully Loaded and Night at the Museum smack of the kind of audience-despising material you might expect from smart writers deliberately trying to dumb down their work for some cold hard cash. Add to that the fact that their movie version of Reno 911, which was released early in 2007, was pretty good. But then, later in the year, they made this film. It's a cheesy little comedy, and it has a lot of potential to be decent, if unremarkable, fun. This is their genre, unlike the children's flicks. There's no conceivable reason to hate your audience here, since presumably they'll be pretty close to the same audience that watches Reno 911. Dan Fogler plays a former child prodigy and Olympic table tennis player. Now he's a loser, but he's being recruited by the FBI to infiltrate an underground ping-pong tournament, hosted by an international criminal, played by Christopher Walken. The premise, reminiscent of other recent underground sports comedies like Dodgeball and Beerfest, doesn't have a lot of promise, it's true. But all a comedy really needs is some good jokes, and it'll fly. Or at least you'd think it would. The problem with Balls of Fury isn't exactly its jokes. They're funny enough, for the most part. It's the delivery. The actors have little ability in comic timing (what halfway decent comedic director would willfully hire George Lopez to be in their movie?), and Robert Ben Garant often fails to sell the jokes, even when they are potentially amusing. Even when the comic performances are good, as is the case with Walken and co-writer Thomas Lennon himself, the editing is so poor that the gags almost never hit. It's all quite maddening. Reno 911 is particularly brilliant in its editing. I really don't see how the same people could produce such a laughless comedy. I guess TV is just their medium, but I don't understand why film-making should prove so difficult for them.",2,2,7,23 December 2007
Ted," Very funny at times, but not that well written
","I was a huge fan of Seth MacFarlane's Family Guy early on, and even quite liked it for at least the first two or three years of its return, but, man, has it ever gotten tired since then. I was hoping this new project would rekindle some talent, especially given its success with both audiences and critics. Frankly, though, this just feels like more of the same. There are, I must admit, some huge laughs in the first half or two-thirds of the film. The gags are very Family Guy-like, and it's about as ramshackle as your average episode of modern Family Guy, but, still, it's funny. The Giovanni Ribisi subplot especially just doesn't work in any way whatsoever, and it completely takes over the film in its final thirty minutes. The relationship plot line that drives the rest of the film is better, but it's not great, either. Neither Mark Wahlberg nor Mila Kunis ever feel like real people, and Ted himself gets old pretty quick. I won't say there wasn't some enjoyment - in fact, if you're interested at all, I'd say it's definitely not painful or anything - but it's pretty weak.",6,0,0,19 November 2012
Coffee and Cigarettes," Mediocre and pointless
","A slight film by anyone's standards. It's not terrible, though. I liked about as much as I didn't like. There was nothing here to love. The film consists of eleven conversations over the title substances, and the characters are real people more or less playing themselves, for the most part. Sometimes it's about two (or more) celebrities meeting each other randomly, sometimes there's a little skit. Some of these people aren't really celebrities, but most seem to belong to the film industry in one capacity or another. For example, in one of the more forgettable sequences, a girl named Renee is bothered by a waiter. Renee is Renee French, who has worked on a show, Fishing with John, on which Jim Jarmusch appeared in the past. The waiter is played by E.J. Rodriguez, who was a musician on Jarmusch's Down by Law. There are other bigger celebrities, like Bill Murray, and Cate Blanchett, who has one of the best scenes playing herself as well as her less famous, lookalike cousin, Shelly. The best scene is probably the one between Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan. Molina, yet to hit it big with Spider-Man 2, sucks up to Coogan, a celebrity more in Britain than in the U.S., as he excitedly reveals that he discovered through geneological research that they are distant cousins. I also liked the sequences with Iggy Pop & Tom Waits, Joseph Rigano & Vinny Vella (and Vinny Jr.), and the final sequence with William Rice & Taylor Mead. The first two sequences are horrible, especially the second, starring Spike Lee's siblings Cinqué and Joie, as well as Steve Buscemi. Buscemi's never been nearly this awful, here playing a Memphis waiter who theorizes that all the bad things Elvis Presley did were actually perpetrated by his evil twin. Buscemi would be wise never to attempt a Southern accent again. And I found out after writing the rest of this that this film was made over a 17 year period. Wow, what a waste of 17 years! 5/10.",5,5,11,23 September 2004
Spider-Man 2," I prefer Spider-Man 1
","Good action movie, but I much prefer the first installment. 2 has arguably the greatest comic book villain of all times, Doctor Octopus, which kind of makes the movie a disappointment since, after him, it's rather forgettable. It really should have been better with such a cool bad guy. Unfortunately, it really drags during the dramatic segments. The film makes no points that weren't made in the first one: can Peter Parker exist without becoming Spider-Man? Will his being Spider-Man always put his loved ones in danger? We've been over all this before, so, at its worst, 2 seems like a simple retread of the first, which I actually found fairly poignant at times. Besides the action sequences involving Doc Ock, there aren't any images as memorable as those of the first, which we are reminded of by a nice opening credits sequence where those famous images are presented as drawings. There are some pretty great comic sequences, fitting well into Raimi's varied career. Bruce Campbell has a hilarious cameo, and, once again, J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson gives the best performance in the movie. 7/10.",7,1,3,30 June 2004
Black Book," Exceptional flick. One of the best 2007 releases.
","Stunning, gripping WWII thriller that plays like a pulpier version of Jean-Pierre Melville's Army of Shadows. That's not something that should be criticized, I think. There's nothing wrong with being entertaining when dealing with serious subjects, as long as the film stays respectful of its subject. And Black Book is respectful. It's tense and exciting, but it always made me understand that these were real people who were undergoing real suffering. I was both extremely entertained and involved in the situation of these characters. Carice van Houten stars, and is brilliant as a Jewish girl who escapes several near-death encounters to end up working with the Dutch resistance movement near the end of the war. She infiltrates a Nazi headquarters by seducing an officer (Sebastian Koch of The Lives of Others). While the film starts off as a very black and white, resistance vs. Nazis flick, things get more and more complicated and, after a while, no one can be trusted. You never know what will happen next. The film-making is very classic, and nearly perfect. Verhoeven has always been an interesting filmmaker, but his work is plagued by sloppiness in both direction and writing. Black Book exhibits few flaws (I might have rethought the opening, which assures us immediately that the protagonist will survive the war). It's one of the most satisfying cinematic experiences I've had in a very long time.",10,1,2,1 October 2007
"I Love You, Man"," Mediocre comedy
","I could easily sum up my feelings on this one in three words: Not Enough Laughs. But I'll go a little further, 'cause I know that's hardly satisfying. Paul Rudd is a newly engaged man who realizes that he doesn't have any male friends. Where his future wife has seven brides maids, he hasn't a groomsman to his name, let alone a Best Man. The film plays like a romance, except it's about a guy looking for a guy friend. It even ends with his guy friend rushing to the wedding. The guy he finds is Jason Segel, who, for the first time, gets Rudd to act like a guy. Which, of course, ends up upsetting his wife-to-be. Everything's very predictable here. But, I'll say it again, it would all be forgivable if there were laughs. There are some, but never big ones. I might be more forgiving if it weren't for the bevy of fantastic comedies we've had in the past few years. Last year alone there was Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Step Brothers and Pineapple Express. Those three are enough to keep you laughing for weeks, and you remember the laughs. So many laughs, in fact, that after I saw each of those films I forgot many of those laughs. Not because they were forgettable, but because other big laughs replaced the first laughs! Nothing at all like that here. For the first time in a while, at least among the other films made by the actors featured in this film, almost all of the good moments were in the commercials. And, I must add, this film must set a record for the biggest waste of a great cast: Jaime Pressly, Jane Curtin, J.K. Simmons, Andy Sandberg, Joe Lo Truglio and Thomas Lennon appear. Most of them get a joke or two (except Curtin  why cast Jane Curtin and not give her one gag?), but with all those great comedians, you want more.",5,5,14,29 March 2009
Batman Returns," Gross and dumb
","I don't think I've seen this all the way through since it was in theaters when I was 13. I don't remember liking it much then, but I've long been thinking of re-watching it. It's developed a cult because of its excessive weirdness. It is that excessive weirdness that keeps it watchable. That, the awesome production design, Danny Elfman's score, and Christopher Walken. Without those elements, though, honestly, I don't know that this is all that much better than Batman & Robin (I'm not about to re-watch that one, but I did pick up Batman Forever on Blu Ray very cheap along with this - probably both will be a waste of money). If nothing else, it certainly plants a lot of the seeds that would grow into the monstrosity that was B&R. The script here is just awful, first and foremost. It's all just a mess, with all kinds of nutty crap thrown on the screen for little to no reason. It's terribly grotesque. Penguin isn't a rich man in a tuxedo, he's a mutant, and Catwoman is a zombie. It has a really dirty sexual streak. It gets really gross watching Danny DeVito perv all over everyone. It's chock full of terrible one-liners that sound awful even coming out of Michelle Pfeiffer. Batman is more or less forgotten for most of the film. Even when it's being aggressively weird, it's mostly boring. Walken really livens up the film whenever he appears - his murder of Selina Kyle is by far the highlight of the film. It's a shame he disappears for a long stretch in the second half. The first Burton Batman holds up pretty well. This one, not so much.",5,70,121,22 August 2016
Superbad," One I think that people will be watching over and over again
","Hilarious and smart teen comedy, without a doubt one of the funniest of the year. Michael Cera and Jonah Hill play two high school seniors who are best friends. When invited to a cool chick's party, they try to get their über-geeky friend, played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse, to use his fake ID (on which he is now infamously renamed 'McLovin') to get them some alcohol. From there, everything goes awry. It's really a laugh-a-minute movie. The previews and commercials ruined a few of the best jokes, but there is no shortage of laughs anywhere in the movie. It also manages to be fairly touching, without devolving into schmaltz (a problem that the film's producer Judd Apatow has yet to solve in his own films). The awkward dialogue is wonderfully convincing, and completely recalled high school for me. Very enjoyable, and one that I hope to enjoy very often in the future.",9,3,13,19 August 2007
The Great Dictator," Pretty good Chaplin film with extraordinarily powerful final moments
","I once caught about a 20 minute portion of this movie on Turner Classic Movies about 6 months back. I thought every minute of what I was watching was gold, and, because it was somewhere in the film's middle and I didn't want to spoil the whole thing if I were to watch it from the start, I decided that I would rent it immediately. Well, the video store which I frequent did not have a copy, so it took me six months to finally go somewhere else and rent it. I had previous to that experience only seen some Chaplin shorts, funny but not greatly artful, but after I saw the snippet of The Great Dictator, I checked out three of his other films, City Lights, The Gold Rush, and Modern Times (City Lights was great, I found the Gold Rush a little overrated, but still worthwhile, and I found Modern Times to be one of the funniest films I've ever seen (second funniest, behind Keaton's Sherlock Jr., more exactly).Finally, the whole of the Great Dictator. Well, to be honest, it had its moments, both of comedy and of drama. But these moments don't always mix well. Chaplin's comedy worked well when mixed with melodrama (City Lights is the best example of this), but it didn't always work with social commentary. Plus, the fact that there was dialogue lessened the impressiveness of Chaplin's talent. Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie as a whole, but I thought it of little consequence. I would have given it a solid 7/10 on the ratings scale...if not for the ending. The final speech that the Jewish barber gives is enormously powerful. Yes, it is adressed to the tempora et mores of 1940, but his message is perfectly applicable to the world today. The speech brought me to tears, and I consider it one of the best endings I've ever seen. Final score: 8/10.",8,13,19,16 September 2000
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Nooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","Way to start the summer, Marvel. This is a prequel to a series of mostly decent comic book movies - I'd rank the second one, X2, as maybe the second or third best comic book movie ever. It concerns the origin of the series' most popular character, Wolverine. Well, that's kind of a lie. It's not really that concerned with anything. It's an indifferently created action movie that goes through the cliché plot line ploddingly. Dialogue is flat, as is the acting. The film is overly violent but completely bloodless - I hate when they edit an R-rated movie into a PG-13 rated movie. At least it's sometimes laughable. Try not to giggle every time Wolverine is on his knees, hands (and claws) spread, screaming 'NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!' That happens four times in the story, and the movie flashes back to one of those times at least once, as well. There's hardly a good thing I can say about it. It's a stinker, probably the worst summer blockbuster since Van Helsing. Sorry, Mr. Jackman. I have nothing against you, but these two movies are beyond abysmal.",3,20,48,3 May 2009
Hot Fuzz," Not as good as Shaun of the Dead, but still fun
","Kind of a disappointment after Shaun of the Dead, but still worthwhile. It certainly is entertaining, after all. Wright's and Pegg's previous film took on zombie films, this one takes on cop movies. The creators follow much the same formula as they did with Shaun of the Dead: they hit upon all the clichés, but add extra layers to the characters and the situation that allow an audience to appreciate it as more than just a comedy. I just don't think this one is as successful. The friendship (again between Pegg and co-star Nick Frost) is fairly poignant, but the rest of the plot is so silly that the emotions don't register nearly as well. Plus, these characters, unlike Shaun's characters, didn't strike me as real people trapped in an absurd movie plot. They're silly characters, albeit with a little more character than the normal comedy (or cop movie), stuck in a silly movie. Don't get me wrong, though, the film has some hilarious comic moments. The over-the-top climax, which plays like a Sergio Leone film, is a lot of fun, and the solution to the mystery that is presented is especially clever. Once again, Pegg and Frost give wonderful comic performances. A lot of the supporting performances are good, too (unlike Shaun, which has a couple of useless characters and a couple of just plain annoying characters), including Timothy Dalton as a creepy grocery store manager.",7,5,11,23 April 2007
The Others," A good way to spend an evening. 7/10
","SPOILERSThis has potential to be as big a hit as The Sixth Sense on account of its nature - it is clearly trying to copy its success and its formula (not to mention its release date - I think they both opened in the exact same week, two years apart). It is nowhere as good as that film, but, if you did like that, you're going to probably like this. I doubt anyone will like this one better, though.Technically, the film is superb. In this aspect, it probably surpasses The Sixth Sense. The editing and especially the cinematography are often breathtaking. The acting is decent. I don't particularly care for Nicole Kidman - she harmed Eyes Wide Shut significantly, in my opinion, but her bizarre style of acting worked fabulously in the purposely campy Moulin Rouge. Here, as a constantly paranoid, possessive, and protective mother, she is more than adequate, though not deserving of any award or special hurrah. The three servants are well played by Fionnula Flanagan, Eric Sykes, and Elaine Cassidy - they have a certain air about them. The best performances come from the two children (another echo of The Sixth Sense, although the adults in that one were also marvelous) - James Bentley as the perpetually frightened Nicholas and Alakina Mann as the intelligent Anne. Mann is in fact wonderful and I hope to see her in other films in the future. There are just a few actors after these principals, and I commend the filmmakers very much. This saves a ton of money, and makes the film more intimate and frightening, which is exactly what this film calls for.Like always, almost all of the film's problems exist in the script. The screenwriter (who is also the director) realizes that his savvy audience will guess that this is a descendent of the immensely popular The Sixth Sense, so he is always attempting to trick us. What are these strange servants up to? A few times, we experience the narrative from their point of view, and what they say drives us wild with guessing. And what is wrong with the father, who had disappeared in WWII (this is set in the 1940s) and then mysteriously reappears in a frightening fog? We know that there are surprises, and these tricks work to confuse us and lead us away - good old McGuffins. I guessed right away, correctly, the father's situation, which kept me from seeing the forest for the trees. What the script forgets to do, or at least forgets to do well, is develop the characters. The children are well developed, but Amenabar relies too much on the inherent creepiness of the three servants for their effect - they almost become silly by the end; anyway, there were several moments when I laughed at their actions, although it might have been intentional. Grace (Nicole Kidman) is Amenabar's biggest failure. Her main character trait is a severe neurosis - her husband has been lost in battle and she has been left alone in an enormous mansion with only her two children. Those children have a severe light sensitivity - they break out in hives when they come into contact with light (no, they aren't Gremlins or magwies). For most of the film, Kidman's character is built up, but the revelations at the end don't ring true. One of the reasons that the ending of The Sixth Sense worked so well was because the final revelations revealed a lot of hidden facets about the characters and their actions in the events which happened beforehand. The revelations here, while very unexpected and clever, don't exactly follow what Amenabar was building.Amenabar also has a problem with suspense. He gives himself all these little peculiarities to deal with - the kids are allergic to light, for instance. But he never really uses that to create suspense. One morning, the children wake up to find that all the curtains in the house have been stolen. It would have been better, perhaps, if we were allowed to watch the curtains being slowly removed at night. The suspense nearer the beginning, when we don't know very much, is quite good. The first set piece is excellent. A lot of the other scary scenes are also quite good, including the climactic one, where the secrets are finally revealed. Still, the film uses too many stingers (sharp rises in the music). That may make us jump, but for a dishonest reason.",7,1,3,10 August 2001
Troy," Don't listen: It's great! PART 1
","All film buffs spend a good deal of time imagining what movies they would make if they only had a chance. For years, I've been thinking up various cinematic adaptations of The Iliad, which is probably my single favorite work of literature. I would not have come up with the same film Wolfgang Petersen has, but I am satisfied with it. In fact, regarding its reception by critics, both amateur and professional, I would say that my expectations were wildly exceeded. I quite loved the film. Yes, it is far from perfect, but it succeeds beautifully. I was especially pleased and impressed with the impeccable casting. I think I'm the only one who feels this way, but there is not a single character, not one, who is miscast. Yes, that includes Achilles, played by Brad Pitt. Pitt has received all kinds of flak, but he is as good an Achilles as I could imagine. I don't even like Pitt as an actor generally; the only other performance of his I like is in Twelve Monkeys. That, although it served its purpose well, was a performance of twitches. This performance shows more maturity than the actor has ever demonstrated before, and perhaps suggests that he might someday be a truly formidable actor, instead of the pretty boy star he is always dismissed as. You can just feel the violence oozing off of Achilles' body as he charges into battle after deadly battle. Pitt has the presence to make Achilles the lion that he says he is. But it's not only the presence that Pitt has. He also successfully demonstrates Achilles' existential dilemma throughout the picture. I really do think Pitt gives an Oscar-worthy performance.Eric Bana plays the film's second lead, Hector, and the film works just as well under his performance. Bana is definitely an actor who will figure prominently in the years to come. He was fine in last year's Hulk, but here he doesn't have to compete with a CGI version of himself for dominance. Orlando Bloom, who is also suffering a lot under the critics, is Paris, and, in my opinion, is perfect. His fight scene with Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson, one of my favorite current character actors) is the film's greatest moment. Brian Cox, who never disappoints, is Agamemnon. Peter O'Toole is fine as Priam, and, although I didn't think he was given quite enough to do, his confrontation with Achilles near the end of the film is as powerful as the scene in the Iliad. Rose Byrne plays Briseis, a character who figures more prominently in this film than in the original poem. This works well, and Byrne's scenes with Pitt are excellent. Sean Bean (Boromir from The Lord of the Rings) gave my favorite performance of the film as Odysseus.Perhaps the only real disappointment is Diane Kruger's Helen. A German, she makes the classic acting blunder of fluctuating in her accent. She seems like an American at first, but then her German accent starts slipping in from time to time. Kruger may have fared better if the screenwriter, David Benioff, had handled Helen's character better. As far as the characters go, Helen is the only one who isn't handled very well in the script. It's easy to see how Helen could get lost in the proceedings; after all, she's a difficult character to figure. Even the Greek authors after Homer had a difficult time dealing with her. They never really understood her role in the story, nor her intentions. Of course, that's not true when you're actually dealing with Homer's two epics; I think Helen comes off as a very strong character in both The Iliad and The Odyssey, and her character is consistent between the two. *continued below*(further comments were destroyed by jackass IMDb editors)",9,7,13,22 May 2004
Dead Poets Society," Quite dull. I don't get the love.
","The only Best Picture nominee from 1989 that I hadn't yet seen. It was a real bad year for the Oscars, I think. Of the five, I like Born on the Fourth of July a lot. Or at least I used to like it. I haven't seen it in years and I'm not sure it would hold up that well. The other four are quite mediocre, with one of the most mediocre winners of all time, Driving Miss Daisy. If you can extrapolate the general IMDb voter's opinion, Dead Poets Society should have won. It's the highest rated of the five, and has about 140,000 more votes than the next most voted on title. That's pretty amazing, really. I don't get it, frankly. Dead Poets Society to me was probably the worst of the five, just complete sludge. The film is about a group of rich white boys at a boarding school who become enamored of their free-spirited teacher, Robin Williams, who teaches them to 'carpe diem,' or 'sieze the day.' The boys (who include Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard) form the Dead Poets Society, where they meet at night in a cave to read poetry. This is, for no reason in particular, highly looked down upon. And woe unto you if you ever want to act in a Shakespeare play, as Leonard eventually does. His father, Kurtwood Smith, does not approve of such frivolities. The final act of this film is pretty ridiculous, with Robin Williams incurring blame for something that clearly had nothing to do with him. The ending, which is supposed to be uplifting, just feels extremely unsatisfying. The performances are actually quite fine. Williams certainly didn't deserve a Best Actor nomination, though. This is clearly category fraud. There is no clear lead, but both Leonard and Hawke probably have more screen time than Williams, who seems like he's barely in the film for it being such a well loved performance.",5,0,1,17 February 2014
Spotlight," Pretty bland
","Mmm, might make my top 50 of 2015. It's a perfectly good movie about investigative journalism, and it's interesting to see the process of journalists, but it's extremely pedestrian filmmaking and has like zero insight into the subject at hand (which is the cover-up of priest molestations). Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams and Brian d'Arcy James play the Spotlight team at the Boston Globe. They're all good, but, except for one big moment with Ruffalo, none of them do anything exceptional. The Globe's new editor, Liev Schreiber (somewhat more interesting, but not much), decides to follow-up on some earlier stories about the subject he thinks are incomplete. The best performance in the film belongs to Stanley Tucci, who plays a lawyer for victims. The second best belongs to Neal Huff as the leader of a victims' organization. Both Huff and Tucci are angry that the Globe is just now getting interested in the story. I think even critics in Boston know that Mad Max: Fury Road is a better film than this. Maybe some day the Spotlight team can uncover that conspiracy.",7,16,31,5 January 2016
Terminator Salvation," The action sequences are great, even if the film isn't
","Most seem to have found this a disappointment, but personally, among the big three action flicks that have been released so far this summer (the other ones being Wolverine and Star Trek), it is the one I enjoyed most. Okay, obviously it's better than Wolverine. Anything would be. I can't really argue that Terminator Salvation is a better movie than Star Trek. It's enormously flawed in its writing, and the lead actor, Christian Bale, is every bit as terrible as Chris Pine was in Star Trek. Yeah, I hate Bale. I have since Batman Begins, and he is definitely a hindrance to my enjoyment of any movie he's in. But the highs in TS are far higher than the test-marketed-to-death Star Trek. First off, I should say that I'm a sucker for post-apocalyptic sci-fi. This film takes place in the future, after Judgement Day but before John Connor has become the great leader he is destined to become. He is now a lieutenant. After a battle, from an underground base Connor has attacked arises a disoriented man named Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington). The last thing he remembers is being executed for murder in 2003. He doesn't know why he's alive (though it's pretty obvious, especially if you've seen the commercials). Wright wanders into the destroyed city of Los Angeles and meets up with a teenage Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin, who was also Chekov in Star Trek and will definitely be a huge star). Reese, of course, is the man Connor will send back in time to protect his mother from the terminator in the original film. He has not yet met up with Connor, who is himself looking for Kyle (remember the tape that Sarah Connor was making at the end of the first movie). That's the set-up anyway. Not that there're many surprises as the film goes on, but it's not a bad story for the most part. It does get bad in its logic, though, sometimes. The final sequences are just stupid. However, the action sequences are generally fantastic. I loved the scene with the gigantic, laser-wielding bot. This is certainly not a must-see, but it's not the embarrassment that many are making it out to be.",7,6,11,31 May 2009
500 Days of Summer," Trying so hard it only occasionally works
","Hipster romance/break-up flick starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel. At its best, it can be either sweet and insightful or downright heartbreaking. Too bad its best comes around only rarely. Most of the film is made up of wannabe clever moments that make it come off as overly cutesy. Among the aspects the film should have dumped to the wayside: the precocious little sister, the completely useless and unfunny best friends, the constant references to indie music and attempts to win indie cred, the Hall & Oates musical number (an ironic wink to the same people who will swoon over the rest of the soundtrack), the quirky greeting card company and, probably most notably, the final sequence. After excising all that, the film would only run about 45 minutes. About the only bit of cleverness that works is a split scene sequence where, the first time Gordon-Levitt is meeting with Deschanel after their big break-up, his expectations play out in real time against what actually happens. That could have backfired, as so much of the rest of the film does, but Webb directs it so well that the end result is devastating. This happens near the end of the film, and for a while it felt like it was jettisoning cutesiness for real emotion. And then comes the final sequence, which is the worst in recent memory. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has given three of the greatest performances of the current decade in Mysterious Skin, Brick and The Lookout. His character here isn't especially well written, and I think he tries to overcompensate a little. Deschanel, playing the title character, is fairly two dimensional. Webb clearly based the girl on a real ex-girlfriend, and it would have been nice to have this film feel more personal. Instead, it feels like a distant, overwritten indie flick, not too far removed from junk like Juno.",5,11,22,2 August 2009
Juno," Too cutesy by half
","When I saw the trailer for this film, what seems now like seven months ago now, I cringed. It came off as if the screenwriter was screaming 'Aren't I quirky? Yay!' I was hoping, even praying, after the hugely positive reviews hit the street, that the trailer was just trying to sell it as a quirky indie flick, and that it was really just a heck of a lot better than that trailer, which, by the time it opened in the Twin Cities, whence screenwriter Diablo Cody hails, I had seen about a thousand times. Alas, no. Not only is it as bad as the trailer made it look, the trailer shows bits from just about every sequence in the film. It doesn't give away one of the movie's big twists, but it does give away about 75% of the jokes. What's truly pathetic is that only about one out of five jokes were funny anyway. And I wasn't the only one who thought so. The theater was packed (Twin Cities residents can't help but flock to any movie that even mentions the state of Minnesota, and the audience got excited at mere references to St. Cloud, Stillwater and Mankato), but not once did the audience collectively find anything uproarious. You'd hear some laughs at most of the jokes, but it was never everybody, and it was only ever sporadic. And the film had its fair share of gags that completely bombed, the audience entirely silent. The plot is incredibly shallow, and completely uninsightful about the issue of teenage pregnancy. Apparently, it's only a condition that requires belabored dialogue and a constant barrage of twee-pop songs to make it out okay. To make it worse, a large portion of the audience was made up of teenage girls. Between this and Britney Spears' sister, I predict teen pregnancy to be all the rage in 2008! Seriously, the whole film sometimes comes off as Diablo Cody making an embarrassing scramble to prove her indie cred. The Stooges! Dario Argento! Belle & Sebastian (okay, I love Belle & Sebastian, too, so sue me). For the most part, the characters are two-dimensional and come off as disconnected from any recognizable reality. For an instance, would an ultrasound technician express her satisfaction that a teen will not be raising the baby so audibly? Would the receptionist at Planned Parenthood treat a patient so cavalierly? The only characters who come off as anything close to three-dimensional are Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner. Garner in particular is outstanding among the actors, and, with this script, you can put all of the credit with her talent. Her scene in the mall is a knockout (perfect for an Oscar clip, yes?). Really, the performances in general are pretty good. As soon as I saw Ellen Page in X-Men 3, I knew she would be a star. I hate the fact that I think X-Men 3 is her best movie so far, despite the two others she's had that garnered some critical acclaim (Hard Candy and the film presently being discussed). I do wish they'd given Michael Cera, so funny in Superbad, a little more to do. I'd like to propose that we stop Diablo Cody before she strikes again. This script CANNOT win Best Original Screenplay. If I start the hunger strike now, I should be able to get some media coverage. Oh, who am I fooling",5,53,107,1 January 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Moves along a bit too slowly to be as good as the first two
","A disappointment, although definitely pretty good. Certainly better than Spider-Man 3. But that ain't saying much, now is it? Basically, At World's End carries over Dead Man's Chest's major problem of too much plot, but loses its virtue of breathless pacing. At World's End is far too slow at times, and it can be easy to get bored between setpieces. Which aren't, I should say, as good as those in either of the first two films. But, all in all, it isn't bad and it's still a lot of fun. Johnny Depp is as great as ever, and he, Geoffrey Rush, Naomie Harris and Bill Nighy's CGI face take part in an enormous ham-off. Personally, I think Rush won. As for the setpieces, the surreal, Being John Malkovich-inspired sequence in Davy Jones's locker is a lot of fun, and the climactic battle aboard the Flying Dutchman, though definitely a little too busy, is cracking.",7,0,2,27 May 2007
Don Jon," Love JGL, but, man, did I hate his character here
","Joseph Gordon-Levitt makes his directorial debut. He's probably the best actor of his generation, and he proves to be more than a competent director, but, I have to admit, I could never get over my initial hatred of his character here. A meathead guido is just never going to do anything other than repulse me. The truth is, this is a film about a jerk who grows into a better person by the end of the movie, but I just could never get over the initial jerkiness. JGL plays a stud who can bed any woman he wants, but he actually finds watching internet porn more stimulating. After an excruciatingly long courting period with his new girlfriend Scarlett Johansson, JGL instantly ruins it when she catches him watching porn. Johansson is good in her role, but she's every bit as despicable as JGL's character. Later in the film, JGL becomes involved with an older student in one of his classes, Julianne Moore, who helps him get over his addiction. Tony Danza is pretty good as JGL's father. Good enough where you can see that one other good role could redeem him as an actor. Brie Larson, who really broke out with Short Term 12 this year, has a Silent Bob-like role as JGL's sister. I swear I didn't even notice she was in the film until she spoke about 3/4 through.",5,1,3,26 January 2014
X-Men," Why does this have such a high rating? 8.2? That's utterly ridiculous.
","X-Men is a decent but a thoroughly sloppily put together motion picture. The special effects are used so much that the film becomes a joke. The mutants and their powers were so unbelievable that my suspension of disbelief was broken almost instantly. Batman and Superman work as movies, at least somewhat, but when a live actor can control the weather or shoot lasers out of his eyes, it just becomes too hard to believe. Now I was  never a fan of comic books, but I was a big fan of the television cartoon series that was around several years ago. I loved that show, and besides Batman: The Animated Series, there wasn't a better cartoon series around. Super powers, when used by real human actors, seem incredibly fake. Used by cartoon characters on the other hand, and they seem more believeable. Also, as a television series, the cartoon allowed characters to develop. The film tries to do this while also being a summer action extravaganza. It doesn't work all that well. 5/10",5,0,0,5 August 2000
Spider-Man 3," Welcome to Summer '07!
","This is first giant blockbuster of the year, and like most of them, it's not very good. Unfortunately, it follows two pretty good Spider-Man films, so that's kind of a disappointment. If you've seen the previews, you can probably guess what goes wrong: too many villains, and too many characters in general. If you thought Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest was sloppily written with all its stories going on (and I didn't myself), this one's going to look like Hell. They have to cut between Peter and MJ, Harry Osbourne, Flint Marko (aka Sandman), and Eddie Brock (aka, at least late in the movie, Venom). A million things happen, and the screenwriters (only three listed, but my guess is there were dozens) have a difficult time keeping it together. They seem to forget characters' motivations at times, and they forget to explain some things, or explain them so quickly that, when they're referenced later in the movie, you have to backtrack and figure it all out. My favorite is the whole relationship between Eddie Brock, Peter Parker's photographer rival, and Gwen Stacy, a classmate of Parker's who becomes Mary Jane's romantic rival. Gwen serves as about ten different plot points at once; it becomes pretty amusing. And she's played by Bryce Dallas Howard, most famous for her extremely bizarre turns in M. Night Shyamalan's last two movies (and to a lesser extent her excellent performance in Lars von Trier's Manderlay). It's just weird to see her as the blonde bombshell type. Gwen and Eddie's relationship is briefly mentioned twice early in the film, with the two barely making contact in the two scenes they share. Later, once Brock is Venom, he is apparently angry at Spider-Man for stealing his girlfriend. This whole thing just made me giggle. Oh, and don't even ask about Harry Osbourne's butler, who magically appears at one point and delivers the stupidest deus ex machina in recent movie memory. Okay, so the movie's badly made. Doesn't mean it isn't entertaining, though. The action sequences are fun, even though a couple of them are so fast you can't tell what's going on. There are a couple of comic sequences which are amusing, even if they feel weird in the context of the film. Particularly funny is the scene where Peter Parker struts down the street wearing the evil black Spider-Man costume under his clothes (it amplifies his aggression, or some such swiftly explained nonsense). And, hey, although it's bad, it's never boring, and I'd even say it's close to entertainingly bad. I mean, I can't hate a film too much that has a climax where Tobey Maguire fights the mechanic from Wings and Eric Foreman.",6,8,20,7 May 2007
Resident Evil: Extinction," First film I saw on Blu Ray. Hi-def doesn't make it any better
","If nothing else, this movie will be a landmark in my film viewing life: it was the first movie I ever saw on Blu Ray (a buddy bought a Playstation 3). If not for that, I'm sure it'd be one for the dustbin of my memory. Granted, it's hard to judge fairly when I never saw the first two installments of this based-on-a-video game trilogy, but Resident Evil: Extinction can only barely count as a movie. It's a post-apocalyptic zombie movie where a genetically engineered woman with excellent fighting abilities (model/musician Milla Jovovich  I refuse to acknowledge her as an actress) helps a ragtag band of survivors escape to Alaska, while she herself infiltrates the underground layer of the Umbrella Corporation, which created the virus that zombified the rest of the world. The plot is mostly nonexistent. I kind of like the set and costume designs (sci-fi being every set and costumer designer's favorite gene), and the movie's watchable when it focuses on the scenery. But it's an action movie, and, for God's sake, the action sequences are dull. CGI looks even more fake in high definition. The director and/or editor cut madly during these sequences, inducing headaches and making it impossible for you to tell what's going on. It's a pretty worthless film, and let's leave it at that.",3,2,5,6 January 2008
Midnight in Paris," Pretty good
","An enjoyable, if slight, Woody Allen comedy. I probably would have enjoyed this more on video than in the theater, however. I don't think there has ever been a film that invited more forced laughter than this one. It's funny, but rarely laugh-out-loud funny. But you wouldn't know that from the audience, who guffawed at the mere appearance of Henri Matisse. The one person in the audience besides me to have heard of The Exterminating Angel made sure to let me know by her laughter during the film's very unfunny Marvin Berry moment. Of course, everyone cackled loudly when Salvador Dali popped up. So everyone by now knows the story: Owen Wilson, playing the Woody Allen surrogate, plays a Hollywood writer entranced with the city of Paris during his trip there. He's annoyed by his stuffy future-wife (Rachel McAdams) and her even stuffier parents (Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy). During a midnight walk through the city, he gets picked up by an old automobile and transported to Paris of the 1920s, where he meets F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston and Alison Pill), Ernest Hemmingway (Corey Stoll), Gertrud Stein (Kathy Bates), Pablo Picasso (Marcial di Fonzo Bo) and other famous figures from the era. He also meets Picasso's current girlfriend, played by Marion Cotillard, and falls for her. Not surprising how quickly he would leave McAdams, who plays such an awfully detestable shrew it's hard to believe anyone even remotely like Wilson's character would put up with her for over two minutes, let alone propose to her at some point. McAdams and her parents are so awful that any sequence that takes place in the present are borderline painful. Fortunately, the sequences where Wilson visits the past, as annoyingly congratulatory as they are, are quite delightful. Wilson ain't half bad, and Cotillard, as always, is enchanting. Most of the historical figures are kind of fun to hang out with. Who wouldn't want to hear Ernest Hemmingway talk about hunting lions all night long? Of course, it helps that Paris really is beautiful, and Allen films it with a fine eye.",7,4,6,21 June 2011
Youth," Probably not for everyone, but I loved it
","I'm not sure if the parts of this film make a great sum, but all the parts sure are fantastic! I quite loved this bizarre little film from the director of The Great Beauty. In fact, I liked it more than The Great Beauty, which I also liked a lot. Michael Caine stars as a retired composer/conductor who is spending a week at a ritzy Swiss spa. His longtime best friend, Harvey Keitel, a still-working film director, is also there. There isn't a strong plot here, more a series of vignettes, but much of Caine's plot revolves around an emissary from Queen Elizabeth II trying to get him to come back from retirement to play a concert for Prince Philip's birthday. Keitel is working on his new film with a slew of young, hipsterish writers. Other subplots involve Caine's daughter, Rachel Weisz, dealing with her husband's leaving her, and Paul Dano plays an actor who's a little peeved he's best known for playing a robot in 'that robot movie.' There are other little subplots, although I'd more call them just weird characters wandering around the spa. Sorrentino obviously wants to be the heir to Fellini, and he's doing a pretty good job of it. This film doesn't feel as much like Fellini as The Great Beauty did, but he has Fellini's eye for casting wonderful weirdos to populate his movies. In particular, I'm totally in love with Caine's masseuse, the gal with the braid and the braces, played by Luna Zimic Mijovic, whom we get to watch dance along to a video game a couple of times and it's just heavenly. Both Caine and Keitel are wonderful. Weisz gets to steal the film for one big monologue, though she's great for the rest of it, too. I don't know if I entirely get it, but I loved it, and it's one of the best of the year.",9,6,11,5 January 2016
Zodiac," Great flick. Can't wait for the special edition DVD!
","Although I've pretty much despised every film David Fincher has made up to this point, I'd always readily admit that he was a pretty good director. If only he had decent material. Zodiac is a super-detailed account of the Zodiac murders that occurred in California in the late '60s through the mid '70s, one of the most famous unsolved cases in American history. One would expect, given the director's previous Se7en, that the film would be horrifyingly gory and unrelentingly nasty. The big surprise is that it isn't at all. We do witness several of the murders, but Fincher doesn't attempt to gross the audience out as he did in Se7en. This is all done in a matter-of-fact way, in the manner of a procedural. It's amazing the way that Fincher and screenwriter James Vanderbilt, as well as Robert Graysmith, who wrote a book on the subject and is one of the key participants in the story (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), construct the screenplay. They feed us just tons of details, but it doesn't at all feel like a dull list. The story also skips ahead in time constantly. Every few minutes, there's a new subtitle, telling us that this is '4 months later' or whatever. It's easy to lose the mood with such a fragmented structure, but Zodiac works perfectly. What's really amazing is how the details build. They're absorbed by the audience. There's so much there that, by the end of the film, everyone looks like they could be the Zodiac. It's a great film, one of the best procedural films ever done, and one of the best, so far, of 2007.btw, rent, don't buy, the first, bare bones edition of the DVD. The studio was desperate to release it, but Fincher has been working on a director's cut and tons of extras. The better DVD should be along sometime early in 2008.",9,0,3,26 August 2007
Milk," Utterly powerful
","I'm usually pretty lukewarm on the kind of movies that are generally considered for Oscars. I expected to not think all that much of Milk, but it exceeded my expectations. Gus Van Sant's first mainstream film since Finding Forrester is about the first gay man publicly elected in San Francisco, Harvey Milk, a gay rights advocate often referred to as the Mayor of Castro Street. Sean Penn dominates the film as Milk, and gives perhaps the best performance of his career. I haven't seen Mickey Rourke in The Wrestler yet, but my initial reaction to Penn's performance is that there is no way he'll not win the Oscar. From the previews, I was kind of thinking Penn's performance would end up seeming like a caricature and impersonation, but, while watching the film, I felt like he instantly faded into this character. It's a cliché, but I really felt like I was watching Harvey Milk, not Sean Penn. The rest of the cast is fantastic as well, especially Josh Brolin as Dan White, Milk's fellow city council member and frequent rival. And eventual assassinator. The relationship between these two men is one of the best aspects of the movie. This story is overwhelmingly powerful at times. There were little things I didn't care for, like the framing structure (Milk is narrating it from one of the last days of his life), but they hardly put a dent in the movie. Gus Van Sant's direction is good, if not as good as in his recent art films (I would rank his direction in Paranoid Park, which currently ranks #10 on my 2008 list, above his direction here). But I commend him greatly for finally, after years of trying, getting Milk's story up on the big screen. It's a movie that must be seen.",9,3,8,14 December 2008
The Prestige," Lacks substance, but is so much fun you won't care too much
","Not as good as Memento or Nolan's first film, Following, but thankfully much better than last summer's Batman Begins (never saw Insomnia). Nolan goes back to the mystery / suspense genre with this tale of two rival magicians (Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale) who compete with each other, sometimes viciously. The film lives on its twists and turns, so it's not a good idea to spoil any of the plot. I thought the movie was pretty entertaining. It's always fun, and I always was eager to see what came next. The twists and secrets are generally pretty good, though one of the story's biggest secrets becomes painfully obvious too early on. I think most of the audience will begin to recognize Nolan's very obvious attempt at sleight of hand whenever a particular character's face is on camera for more than a handful of frames. That doesn't harm the entertainment value too much. What I would have liked, and what I think would have made the film much more memorable, is a bit more emotional involvement. The characters are universally two-dimensional here. They're all just a cipher for the plot. The movie had absolutely no thematic complexity, either. Neither one of these things that it lacks is particularly far from its grasp. And without complex characters or themes, the film is just a 'Wow, this is cool!' rather than a 'What is it that I just experienced?' I know that, to so many in the IMDb community, that's the same thing, but it really isn't. I do think Nolan succeeded at finding depth with Memento, but he certainly hasn't here. Still, I'm satisfied with it just being a cool popcorn movie.",8,0,3,23 October 2006
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Amazing to behold, but the script is mediocre
","The ads for Guillermo del Toro's Hellboy sequel declare the director 'a visionary', and I honestly can't argue that at all. Pan's Labyrinth contains some of the most gorgeous imagery of any fantasy film. Hellboy II, I would argue, goes even bigger, with its undoubtedly much bigger budget. For once, here's a summer special effects movie that makes me think 'WOW!' There are a lot of fantastical creations to be seen, from giant trolls to fearful demons with eyes on their wings. Unfortunately, much like my reaction to Pan's Labyrinth, all the gorgeousness is pretty much for the purpose of nothing. The script is very formulaic when you boil it down, and it occasionally hits points that make little sense. For instance, there is a classic comic book moment where Hellboy helps a crowd of human beings but is then accused of being the villain when it couldn't be more obvious that he just saved everyone's life. It didn't take me too long to realize that, aside from the awesome character design, I wasn't identifying with these characters much at all. I would still highly recommend the film to people looking for some dazzling visuals and some good action sequences.",8,7,14,13 July 2008
Cloverfield," Bland yuppie characters don't make me care much that they might die. But the monster is scary!
","I've been thinking of this movie as the Blair Godzilla Project for months now, and I was pretty much entirely correct on what to expect. It's a good concept. I mean, everyone decided to hate The Blair Witch Project after it opened wide, but it was an excellent idea, and an effective film. It didn't work more than once, but that first time packed quite a wallop (for me at least). Cloverfield has the same flaws as that film. You spend a lot of time wondering why the character with the camera wouldn't at least set the camera aside some of the time (they do attempt to make it more believable than BWP did, but it's not always convincing). Also as in BWP, the characters are bland, vapid and not much worth caring about. They're all very TV-style good looking (in fact, most everyone involved with the movie came from that medium), and you'd certainly stare at the girls' butts if you saw them on the street. But on TV or in the movies, they're average. Does any real-life woman actually find the scruffy, unshaven look sexy? Hollywood has been shoving that look upon us for years now, and I don't think I've ever known of a female who wants her face ground down by stubble every time she gets close to her guy. Two of the male characters look so much alike I was relieved when one of them bit the dust. At least I wouldn't be confused anymore. But, oh yeah, there's a monster. And it's pretty scary. And the filmmakers are smart enough to hold back on what you see (although I should mention that Korean director Bong Joon-Ho made a much better monster movie last year in which the monster is seen in toto almost immediately). All in all, Cloverfield is a moderately entertaining monster movie. If you didn't like The Blair Witch Project, I would definitely avoid it. But if you did like BWP, and like Godzilla, it's not a bad way to spend 90 minutes. Make sure, if you do see it, to sit through the credits sequence. There's a lot of buzz about an impossible-to-hear mumble that is audible right before the studio logo comes up, but the real reason to stick around is to hear Michael Giacchino's bombastic and hilariously unnecessary closing overture and what it's called. It makes the movie.",7,2,12,20 January 2008
Once," If you see this on a date, you might expect to get married in the near future
","A musical romance that offers simple pleasures, but they are genuine and intense. A street performer (Glen Hansard) is confronted by a girl (Markéta Irglová) who likes his song. The two strike up a relationship based on music. There's not much story, per se, but the emotions of falling in love are communicated gorgeously through the songs the two write together. The setting and characters are working class, and the film is shot on hand-held video cameras. Between this and the songs, the movie has a beautiful handmade quality that perfectly captures the passion and love that went into it. This is definitely one of the best films I've seen this year, and I'm sure it's one that will be fondly remembered, perhaps even adored by all who see it.",9,5,7,17 June 2007
The Adventures of Tintin," Fantastic!
","This is probably Spielberg's best adventure film since Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and he demonstrates how awesome motion capture animated films can be. He takes to the medium like a fish to water, and the whole thing is just an awesome spectacle. It almost seems like the film is populated with human actors wearing cartoon costumes. Its odd, but not at all offputting. The performances are uniformly good, but once again we have a motion capture performance by Andy Serkis (here playing Captain Haddock) which is just outstanding. Not only the physical acting, but the voice acting, which he also performed, are absolutely wonderful. Jamie Bell plays Tintin. The character's an institution in Europe, but pretty unknown in the United States (thankfully I used to watch the British animated series, which aired on HBO in the early '90s - I vividly remember the subplot about the pickpocket that appears here from that show). Perhaps people will catch up to Tintin and be there more for the two sequels (which will be directed by Peter Jackson, who consulted with Spielberg, who has owned the movie rights since the '80s, on this one).",9,0,5,17 January 2012
Fast & Furious 6," I don't get how this and the previous installment were so well received. They're utterly stupid.
","A rare film that I saw in the theater and barely remembered I saw it just a few hours later. Honestly, I had no interest in it, was just with family over Memorial Day weekend and had a free ticket anyway. Still, what a waste of time. Who cares about the plot? Whenever the characters are talking between action sequences, it's pure torture. Who gives a crap what these people are saying? The action sequences themselves are somewhat amusing, but they aren't really that good. Too much editing, leading to occasional confusion. Physics are completely ignored. Momentum, inertia, gravity: fuhgetaboutit. When I watched the fifth F&F movie, which I did because it actually got very good reviews somehow, I thought to myself, eh, maybe I disliked it because I was watching it at home alone, which is clearly not the right environment. But hanging out with family and seeing the sixth one with an audience, yeah, I think they really do suck (though, truth be told, I remember enjoying the first one, which I saw on video with my brother when it came out).",5,7,15,2 June 2013
The Expendables," Big and dumb, but it delivers exactly what it promises
","Sylvester Stallone enjoys his old age Renaissance with this amusing throwback to the cheesy action movies of the 1980s and 90s. It's dumb as Hell, and very poorly directed (by Stallone himself), but it does pretty much deliver. Stallone and Jason Statham lead a team of mercenaries, which also includes Dolph Lundgren, Jet Li, Terry Crews and some other tough guys. They're hired by Bruce Willis (who appears in one scene alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger) to infiltrate an island nation and assassinate the bloody general who has taken it over (David Zayas, who co-stars in the show Dexter). Stallone discovers that the general is really unimportant, and that the real villain running things is Eric Roberts, with former professional wrestler Steve Austin his second in command. Stallone doesn't really want to get involved in this crazy business, but is ultimately inspired to go through with it because of a rebel woman he meets there (Giselle Itié). The plot doesn't make a lot of sense, but there's a lot of explosions and beatdowns. It delivers what it promises, even if I did forget that I even saw it by the next day. Mickey Rourke has a nice small part as a former member of the Expendables, and Charisma Carpenter (of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel fame) has a nice part as a chick who dumps Statham.",7,6,11,22 August 2010
MASH," Great, but takes a stupid turn near the end that harms the overall product
","I loved nearly every moment of MASH. It balanced its drama and comedy quite perfectly. The acting was great and the characters were well developed. This is also one of the few episodic movies which works well. Episodic films usually become tedious. Every episode in MASH is entertaining and works towards developing its characters and its mood. My only complaint, which was originally going to be a small one, but as it went on and on and on, it became a big enough problem to knock the film down a notch in my opinion: the football sequence. This sequence goes on for nearly twenty minutes, and occupies most of the last moments of the film. Before this, the film kept getting better and better as it went on. Then, with the football game, it hit an insurmountable wall. The one thing this film did not need was  a sports finale. Everything seems to depend on the game, even though absolutely nothing does depend on it. I was interested in the characters, and during the game, I couldn't even tell which one was which. Therefore, I could have cared less about what was happening here. I became terribly bored, almost to the point of fast forwarding through this sequence. To boot, Hot Lips becomes insufferably annoying and uncharacteristically bimbonic as she dresses up as a cheerleader. We were told in a previous scene that Hot Lips rebuked the others for playing football, so it seemed unlikely to me that she would turn into a cheerleader.I was praying that the film would not end at the end of the game, and luckily, it didn't. It does have a rather classy ending, as I would expect from Altman. The credit sequence is very unique, kind of like the end of Welles' Magnificent Ambersons or Altman's own opening credits for his greatest masterpiece, Nashville. I still give MASH a 9/10, but it should have been a 10/10, because it was going that way the entire picture.",9,4,9,5 August 2000
Pan's Labyrinth," It's good, but nowhere near as good as the reviews would have you believe
","I had unsurmountable expectations for this one, and, alas, they remain unsurmounted. It didn't even come close. It is an entertaining film, but, as a whole, it feels half-baked. Near the end of the Spanish Civil War, a little girl, Ofelia, is taken with her pregnant mother to an old mill, where her new husband, a sadistic army captain, awaits. At the mill, she meets a fairy who leads her to a faun, who asks her to perform three tasks so she might take her place as princess of a magical kingdom. It's less a fantasy film than a fairy tale. In that way, I suppose I'm obliged to forgive that its fantasy world goes completely unrealized and remains paper thin throughout. Honestly, except for a couple of sequences, there really isn't a fantasy world. Most of the film takes place in the real world, where the Captain is trying to rid the area of some pesky rebels and Ofelia's mother is struggling to survive her difficult pregnancy. What is much harder to forgive, though, is that Guillermo del Toro extends the two-dimensionality to the Spanish Civil War setting. The Captain is a completely cartoonish bad guy, and the situation is seen completely in black and white. I mean, we're talking about a real conflict here where many people died. It's kind of insulting. If this were an American made film, people would be railing against it. It's also insulting to Spirit of the Beehive, on which del Toro has said he based the film. Where Spirit is a gentle yet effective study on the nature of human cruelty, Pan celebrates human cruelty with extremely violent sequences which are meant to be enjoyed as they are in action films (the director did, of course, previously make Blade II and Hellboy). Wow, it sounds like I hated this film! I didn't, really. I have some ideological problems with it, obviously, and I wish it were better than it is. But it is an enjoyable little horror/fantasy film. You could do better, but you could do worse, too.",7,132,229,21 January 2007
Blade II," Big, dumb, and forgettable
","Blade II isn't terrible. I, in fact, like it a smidgen better than the original. That film suffered from a very uninteresting love interest (who doesn't come back) and a dull villain. It had its moments, though, and so does Blade II. The visuals in both films are excellent, with a marvelous eye towards the set designs and costumes. II contains more computer animation, with several scenes using far too much computer animation. It tries to hide that a few times by setting the sequences in the dark or whatever, but you'd have to be mentally challenged not to notice. Because of this, its action sequences don't carry as much weight or energy. It steals liberally from The Matrix and, even moreso, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. It's slightly better than The Matrix, pretention incarnate, but can't come close to the physical beauty of CTHD, whose action sequences did not rely on computers.Blade II steals its plot wholesale from Aliens, which is a common action film to steal from (it's probably the best ever made at this point, over 15 years old now). The villains are pretty cool, but they're a direct combination of Max Schreck (of Nosferatu fame) and the aliens from Aliens. They're still pretty brutal. A lot of the supporting cast is simply terrible. The film employs a ton of uber-predictable twists and betrayals. You'll see some of them coming and you'll wonder why the writers even bothered with others. 5/10.",5,4,8,27 March 2002
Knocked Up," Very funny, as well as touching. But it has some problems.
","Sweet-natured romantic comedy about a one-night stand that results in pregnancy. The two reluctant parents are Ben (Seth Rogan), an unemployed stoner, and Alison (Katherine Heigl), a newly hired reporter for the E! cable network. The film follows their experiences and their rocky relationship. We also spend a lot of time with Alison's sister and brother-in-law (Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd), as well as Ben's roommates (too many to mention, but is Jonah Hill Chris Penn's love child or what?). The film runs a tad over two hours long, and with all these characters, it feels rushed. I liked the characters, but wanted to know them better. I think Alison especially gets short-changed. Writer/director Apatow's experience surely lies with Ben, and it feels like we spend a lot more time with him. I didn't feel like I understood Alison's choices. A career-minded 20-something Los Angelina gets knocked up by a chubby, pot-smoking under-construction porn site running loser. Yeah. I honestly never believed that this character would have a baby. The film addresses the abortion issue, but in a flippant manner. Joanna Kerns pops up in one scene as Alison's mother, and advises her to get an abortion. It's clearly just there so a conservative audience can hiss at her. Sorry, folks, but people like Alison have abortions every day of the week and twice on Sundays. Without a little more background, I don't buy it. I'm also left perplexed at the absolute plethora of pop culture references. What purpose do they serve other than to date the film immediately? They talk about going to see Spider-Man 3, for Christ's sake! Despite those grumbles, the film is quite enjoyable. I liked Apatow's previous film, The 40 Year-Old Virgin, but felt it could have been funnier. Knocked Up succeeds a lot better in its comedy. It does rely a bit too much on the stoner roommates, and a scene where Rogan and Rudd take mushrooms during Cirque de Soleil is not nearly as funny as Apatow seems to think it is. But, heck, I laughed a lot during the film. And I was touched to a certain extent. Very worthwhile, though I'd definitely recommend Waitress over this.",8,7,18,3 June 2007
Begin Again," Wonderful! Nearly as good as Once!
","John Carney's follow-up to the enormously popular Once is really pretty similar to Once. This might have annoyed me if it hadn't been a few years since Once, but I didn't mind that much at all. The music isn't quite as good, and he's mostly working with Hollywood stars this time instead of musicians, but I ended up thoroughly charmed by it. Keira Knightley, playing the up-and-coming singer/songwriter trying to get over her recent heartbreak, is just luminous. She is just so damed lovable and sweet. She has a pretty good singing voice, too. Not something you haven't heard before, but it's nice. Mark Ruffalo plays the down-and-out record producer who discovers her. As cliché as the two parts may be, the actors add a lot of personality to them and they come off as real. The film also co-stars Hailee Steinfeld and Catherine Keener as Ruffalo's daughter and ex-wife. Musicians Mos Def, Adam Levine and CeeLo Green also co-star (Levine is the only one who is a decent actor; he plays Knightley's ex-boyfriend, who's becoming a mega-rock star). As I said, the songs aren't quite as good as the ones in Once. They are a lot poppier. But I wouldn't say they're any less heartfelt. The film may not have a 'Falling Slowly' level song, but the one Knightley sings as a voice message to Levine is almost as good.",9,2,5,27 July 2014
Alien," The Purina Dog Chow company will expand and make a big mistake!
","Ridely Scott is such a minimalist in Alien that many sci-fi nuts find it slow and unexciting. So many people prefer Aliens, its sequel, to this one. I think Aliens, directed by James Cameron, is another sci-fi masterpiece (and maybe the best action film ever made), but I think Alien is much better. In fact, I would say that it is among the best films ever made, in sci-fi, only second to 2001. The plot absolutely lacks contrivance. All the plot points develop how they would naturally. And there are great surprises throughout the film. Even if you haven't seen the film, you know about the chest-bursting scene. You probably saw it parodied dozens of times. But watch the scene where Ian Holm reveals his secret! That is one amazing scene! I actually saw the sequel first, so I kind of knew that secret, too, but it still shocked me. It was so well directed.Notice how the dialogue works. It never particularly draws attention to itself. It actually reminds me of Robert Altman, how he directed such movies as Nashville, where many characters are speaking at the same time, and nothing seems more or less important than anything else. It is just like real life. Alien is one of the most realistic, documentary-like sci-fi films ever made. Also notice the setting. The Nostromo's design is so believable that I feel that I'm actually seeing a real space vehicle. The alien ship also beams with its spookiness.The characters are also extremely believable. They are so well written that even the first character who dies is completely developed. If you get the DVD, they actually created dossiers about each of the crew members. It also has extra scenes which round out the characters even more. I think Ripley is one of the most endearing characters in film history. Even in the last two sequels, which were visually interesting but not very well written or directed, Ripley held my interest. I teared up when she died at the end of 3. If they made a fifth one, I would go, no matter how terrible I knew it would be. The acting is also top-notch. Ian Holm, a great actor, gives one of his best performances here. I love the last scene that he is in. Truly a master. And of course Sigourney Weaver could have just as easily been nominated for an Oscar for her performance here as she was for Aliens. I wish she would make more movies. She's so talented.The most important part of a film, in my mind, is the mood. And boy, does Alien have one of the most genuinely spooky movies I've ever seen. Make sure you watch it after the sun has gone down. Also, watching it alone will help. The special effects are kind of cheap, but Scott knows this well enough. He only shows the alien for seconds at a time. Besides keeping us from seeing the shoddiness of those puppets, this technique makes the alien seem all the more creepy and mysterious. 10/10, no doubt at all (BTW, the symbols all over the Nostromo are the same insignias as those of the Purina Dog Chow company)",10,140,196,6 April 2000
Blades of Glory," Forgive the clichÃ©, but I laughed until I cried
","If you're looking for great film-making or thoughtful satire, definitely turn around. On the other hand, if you're looking for a funny comedy, you're in the right place. Will Ferrell plays a character that would stand perfectly well next to all of his SNL characters, which, I know, is kind of a backhanded complement. But he's funny, God bless him, and the writers (Jeff and Craig Cox, as well as several others) give us plenty to laugh at besides him. John Heder was starting to suggest that he had nothing in him besides Napoleon Dynamite, but he's pretty funny here. Amy Poehler and Will Arnet are great as the villains, and Nick Swardson, a Minneapolitan whose stand-up act I'm going to see in June, has a great role as Heder's stalker (stick around for the end credits to see a hilarious bit with him). There are so many great comedy moments, but the climactic chase sequence between Ferrell and Arnet, which starts out funny enough on ice skates but gets about ten times funnier when they reach dry land, has to be one of the funniest sequences of all time. This is the rare movie that I was sad to see end, because I just enjoyed it so much.",9,1,5,9 April 2007
Horrible Bosses," Uneven, but Day and Aniston are hilarious
","I almost want to recommend this comedy, because at times it can be absolutely hilarious. The problem is that it's so uneven. So many jokes just completely flop. Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day star as three guys who can't stand their bosses. Bateman's is Kevin Spacey, a control freak who basically tortures him all day. Sudeikis has Colin Farrell, a cokehead who undeservedly runs the company after his father (Donald Sutherland, briefly) has a heart attack. And Day has Jennifer Aniston, a dentist who sexually harasses him throughout his shifts as her assistant. The three buddies get together and decide to do a Strangers on a Train thing. Now, the big thing is that the Day/Aniston storyline is far, far more hilarious than the other two situations. If you don't know Charlie Day, you should, because he's one of the funniest people on Earth. He's best known for his role on It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. He probably doesn't have a lot of range, as his character here is just a less stupid version of his Charlie Kelly from Sunny, but who cares? That character is great, and Day is hilarious here. Aniston, too, matches him with her cougar act (she particularly likes to talk dirty while she operates on gassed patients). Its her best role in years - she can be so damn good it's depressing that she's always in such crap. Bateman and Sudeikis are both fine, but they only really work well when Day is in the mix (the three of them together have good comic chemistry). Spacey and Farrell fare worst, as neither of them are given too interesting a character. Spacey has played this role better in Swimming with Sharks. Jamie Fox has a great supporting role as a guy named 'Mofo' Jones (except, obviously, the full word), whom the guys consult on their intended crime. Most of the funniest gags are Day's, and hopefully this will land him a leading role in a comedy film.",6,0,1,20 November 2011
Battleship Potemkin," I don't give a darn that it's been said a million times before: Battleship Potemkin simply IS one of the greatest films ever made, like it or not
","I did something a little daring tonight when I watched this movie. I attempted to wean myself from silent movie scores. Sure, when this film originally was distributed, a piano score was probably played with it. Oftentimes, the director would choose the score himself (Charlie Chaplin often composed the scores of his later silent films). But most of the music you hear on VHS tapes over silent films is in no way the same music that was supposed to be played when the film was first released. And, then again, there were plenty of silent films that were played without a score. I do not know the history of Potemkin's score, so I decided to watch it for the medium this piece of art was produced within - film. Soon after I turned the music off, unaided (or should I say unimpeded) by the musical interpretation of the emotions on screen, I became utterly attached to the film. Visually, it is easily one of the most stunning of all films. Eisenstein was a master of composition. The editing, possibly the cinematic technique Eisenstein is most famous for (montage), is extraordinary. The mood of this film is anger, and it stirred my passions violently. It takes a lot of effort to enjoy a silent film, especially a drama, but films like Battleship Potemkin prove that this effort is entirely worth it. Come on! You owe it to yourself to watch this film! Your education is incomplete without it.",10,13,27,20 January 2001
Elf," Ferrell tries his best, but the writing is unambitious and mediocre
","So-so film with a few really funny moments. It always seemed like the comedy could have gone two steps further than it did. There are tons of missed opportunities and jokes that are built up without payoff (the news broadcast at the end of the film is a perfect example). Elf earns points for being a decent family film in that it has almost no objectionable content  one very long belch is about it. It's nice that it doesn't resort to gross-out humor, but it could certainly stand to be less lame a lot of the time. Will Ferrell, a former Saturday Night Live actor, stars as a human who is raised by elves until his enormous height compared to the other elves makes this fact all too obvious. When Ferrell finds out that his father (James Caan) lives in New York City, he goes out and finds him. It becomes a standard fish-out-of-water comedy. The writing is half-hearted, so the weight of the movie ends up resting wholly on Ferrell, who does his damndest to carry it on his shoulders. I've always been a fan of Ferrell, even if he did create a couple of truly obnoxious characters on SNL. He actually does a fine job in Elf, playing a truly manic but sweet idiot. The filmmakers should have trusted Ferrell more, because it really shoots itself in the foot when it begins to concentrate on a very cheesy and unbelievable crisis in the elf's newfound human family. Ferrell has run away from home, and Caan and his family think they can find him in New York City  which, of course, they do. And Ferrell (along with his family and his girlfriend) have to convince the people of NYC to have faith in Santa Claus so his sleigh can fly. They do this by having the girlfriend (a very cute Zooey Deschanel, who might look a bit too much like Reese Witherspoon to become a star) sing 'Santa Claus Is Coming to Town' on the news. I was enjoying the film, but this kind of formulaic garbage just ruined it. It's nice to see Bob Newhart, Charles Durning, and Andy Richter. One of my favorite comediennes, Amy Sedaris, was also there somewhere, but I must have missed her (was she one of the elves?). 5/10.",5,12,34,8 November 2003
Shutter Island," The lame twist at the end does little to detract from an otherwise great ride
","For those who complain that Scorsese, in the 2000s, spent a decade trying to win a Best Picture Oscar, Shutter Island might be for them. It's essentially a B movie, an insane asylum-based thriller adapted from a novel by Dennis Lehane. You'll probably guess the film's final twist within a matter of minutes, but it doesn't matter too much. It's a heck of a ride. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as a Federal Marshall from Boston visiting an island asylum for the criminally insane after one of their patients mysteriously vanishes. He has an idea that there might be something more sinister going on on the island. Mark Ruffalo plays DiCaprio's partner, Ben Kingsley the head psychiatrist of the institution and Michelle Williams is DiCaprio's deceased wife (in frequent flashbacks, dreams and fantasy sequences). They round out the main cast. The supporting cast includes Max von Sydow, John Carroll Lynch, Elias Koteas, Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson, Ted Levine and Jackie Earle Haley. Everyone in the film turns in an excellent, heated performance (Ruffalo is a tad more laid back than the rest). Some of the movie plays out like a first-rate horror story, especially DiCaprio's entrance into the dreaded Cell Block C, which contains the most violent criminals in the institution. As I stated above, it's pretty easy to guess at what this is all leading to, and, when it gets there, Scorsese spends far too long explicating everything. But the very last moment of the film is quite good. All in all, it's a worthy film in the Scorsese canon.",8,3,7,21 February 2010
Full Metal Jacket," This film's divergent halves confuse too many people
","People just refuse to use their brains. They love the first half of Full Metal Jacket, and then basically give up on the second half. It is depressing. Don't you think you should at least try to understand why the film is split up like that? In fact, despite what so many people think, Full Metal Jacket is a perfectly structured opus - one of the most original pieces of art ever created. I am not going to get into it, but I will just say that it is YOUR JOB AS A VIEWER to figure out the connection between the two halves. 10/10.",10,44,86,9 July 2001
The Grapes of Wrath," Note Perfect
","There's probably nothing new I could say about this film - just the regular and much deserved praise: John Ford's direction is perfect, perhaps only surpassing it in The Searchers, as well as Greg Tolland's cinematography; the next year, he would photograph Citizen Kane, and his work there is just the slightest hair better than his work here (which, of course, means that this is one of the most impeccably photographed films ever made). And then there's the acting. Henry Fonda was, no doubt, one of the greatest actors of all times, and this might just be his best film (other great roles of his include The Lady Eve, made the following year, and Hitchcock's underrated The Wrong Man). John Carradine has his shining hour here - too often he was cast in B-movies. Even in Stagecoach, his role was kind of, well, cheesy (I'm not a big fan of that particular Ford film). That scene where Tom Joad meets him in the tent is excellent; Carradine is brilliant (and so is Greg Tolland; man, look at the lighting job!). I do, however, wish he had kept his mustache. It's hard to picture him without it! But even with those two masterful actors, a viewer's attention will always shift to Jane Darwell, who plays the Joad matriarch. She won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar, perhaps the most justly won Oscar in the Academy's history. There is a scene near the beginning of the film in which, as the Joad family is just about to flee their home, Mrs. Joad finds some old earrings. She puts them up to her earlobes and looks in the mirror. How long has it been since she was young or beautiful enough to wear earrings? The past is past, and it will never come back.",10,3,8,5 November 2001
Pacific Rim," The action is fun. The characters are bland.
","Guillermo del Toro aims straight for the big summer blockbuster with this giant robots vs. giant monsters (actually referred to as kaiju in the movie) flick. I have to admit, I find del Toro's films a little undercooked most of the time - I kind of wish he'd return to his earlier, simpler stuff like Cronos and The Devil's Backbone. Even Pan's Labyrinth, in my opinion, lacks personality. The big problem here is with the characters. The lead, Charlie Hunnam (the star of Sons of Anarchy), is about the dullest protagonist in recent memory. Idris Elba, who gave an all-time great television performance in The Wire, is quite boring. About the only two actors who register are Rinko Kikuchi - mostly because she's an adorable Japanese girl - and Charlie Day (of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, a show on which Guillermo del Toro once appeared as an actor), who brings the same manic energy he usually has, and perhaps comes off as a bit too much. Ron Perlman also has a nice little role, little more than a cameo. When there aren't giant monsters on screen, the film can drag. It mostly makes up for that, though, when the action starts. The good, old fashioned monster smashdown does not disappoint. I'd give it a slight recommendation.",7,2,8,15 July 2013
American Sniper," Intense
","Clint Eastwood adapts the autobiography of Chris Kyle, a Navy SEAL who had the most confirmed kills in the Iraq War. The film pretty much takes the same tack as The Hurt Locker in examining how war effects a man. There's obviously a lot more combat here than in Hurt Locker, and it's very much a war action movie. I didn't find it exploitative, though. Unlike the recent turd Fury, the combat sequences are intense, not 'fun.' The violence is wince-inducing, and you're just hoping to get through it. The film does question, just a little, the purpose of the war, but the protagonist never does. He never did. He was a soldier, and this was his job, to protect his men, and he was good at it. The film hinges on the performance of Bradley Cooper, and he is very good. Sienna Miller has the unfortunate role of the wife who worries and begs him to come back (all this material was done far better in The Hurt Locker).",8,34,68,18 January 2015
The Devil Wears Prada," Even though I wish it were less formulaic, it's still pretty enjoyable
","Not an especially interesting movie narratively, but the performances are so good that it's very watchable. Anne Hathaway plays a frumpy girl (Hollywood frumpy, that is  only in Hollywood could Anne Hathaway be repeatedly referred to as fat) who gets a job in the fashion industry under the cruelest exec in the biz, played by Meryl Streep. Streep has been getting pretty much all the credit for the movie. It's not entirely fair. She is indeed excellent  you just want to strangle that bitch. But the film would be utterly worthless without a strong central performance, and Hathaway supplies it. Even when the film is at its least engaging, Hathaway makes it engaging. More her presence, I suppose, than her performance. I mean, damn, she's an attractive young woman. You'd think her smile could cure cancer, or at least bring dead puppies back to life. Emily Blunt and especially Stanley Tucci also deserve a lot of credit in the main supporting roles.",7,1,2,18 December 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Almost good
","For the first two thirds of Attack of the Clones, the film ranges from total mediocrity to passable entertainment to horrific boredom. The dialogue is rather awful, the plot developed in a hackneyed manner. A couple of the early action sequences are fun, especially the one involving Jango Fett, whose young clone is named Boba (Boba Fett fans will be given their money's worth in this one!). The love story with Queen Amidala and Anakin Skywalker is truly execrable. I wouldn't dismiss Hayden Christensen as many have already (Portman is actually the film's weakest link). Just by chance, I saw about 2/3 of Life As a House the night before I saw Star Wars, in which Christensen stars as a troubled teen, much as he does in Attack of the Clones. He's not a bad actor, really. I would more blame the inadequacy of the character on the writing. Lucas has no clue how to develop emotions on screen, at least in this character, without shoving it into the dialogue. The only success that Lucas has in the character is in an homage to The Searchers, where Annie (they really need to stop calling him this; he'll turn into Darth Vader just because everyone keeps insulting his manhood!) goes off into the deserts of Tatooine to rescue his mother from a group of Sand People. Lucas even quotes some of Ford's best shots.After this sequence, Anakin and Amidala are forced to run off to save Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor, who is, btw, much better here than he was in Ep. 1). There is a decent, but somewhat confusing action sequence involving Amidala stuck on a conveyor belt in a robot factory. Amidala and Anakin are captured and thrown into a colosseum and are forced to fight three giant monsters. From this point, Attack of the Clones can do (almost) no wrong. In the most impressive mid-film change of quality that I've ever seen, Attack begins to equal the best sequences in the first trilogy, and perhaps beat most of them. 45 or 50 minutes of straight excitement bring Attack of the Clones to a close, with C3PO's awful action movie one-liners being the only distraction. The obligatory lightsaber duel between Count Dooku and Obi-Wan and Anakin had me gripping the armrests in excitement, and the now infamous lightsaber duel between Dooku and Yoda had me clapping and laughing at the same time. Yoda still ranks as the best character in the series (he's especially great in this film). And then comes the final shot, which will make any Star Wars fan cringe in horror (but this time in a good way!). Fans who hated Episode I will appreciate the fact that Jar Jar Binks is the indirect cause of the Empire's rise to power. I still can't forgive the weakness of most of the film. It pulls itself together so well that it's tempting to let the whole film pass, but I have to give it, at the most, 6/10.P.S. On a second viewing, right after I saw the final installment of the series, Attack seemed quite a bit better, so I raised my score a point.",7,1,4,19 May 2002
Gone Baby Gone," Has its flaws, and some big ones, too, but still achieves something near greatness
","Ben Affleck's directorial debut, based on a novel by Dennis Lehane, who also wrote Mystic River. Affleck's direction is more than adequate. I'm sure he's aping Clint Eastwood's film version of Mystic River much of the time, and there's one scene that's way too reminiscent of Se7en, but he shows a lot of skill. He's great at capturing his hometown of Boston and the people who live there. The story revolves around the investigation of a missing girl. Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris are two of the major investigators for the police. The aunt of the missing girl hires Casey Affleck and his girlfriend, played by Michelle Monaghan, to do private investigation on the side, because they can maybe find some secrets that the girl's mother (Amy Ryan) might be hiding. It's a gripping mystery story, and it arrives at one quite satisfying twist. But then there's another twist. The second big twist is completely stupid, and then the previously excellent film starts to fall. This isn't unlike Mystic River, where, when we finally found out why Tim Robbins has been acting so strange all the time, I just had to slap my forehead. Gone Baby Gone is able to pull itself up a bit from its head-slapping plot revelation in its final moments, but I was still left feeling cheated. I also have to complain that Monaghan, as cute as she is, adds very little. Would Affleck's character really put his girlfriend in such dangerous situations all the time? I'm sort of glad we're spared the whole cliché schtick where one of the two lovers fears for their significant other's safety, but bringing the hot chick into a powerful drug dealer's den sounds like a hostage situation waiting to happen. Casey Affleck delivers his second fine performance of the year, though it isn't as good as his Robert Ford, which I think might some day be considered iconic. Ed Harris is a sure thing for an Oscar nomination. The guy is such a master at his craft. It's a credit to Affleck's direction that the film can still be considered so good after some should-be fatal flaws.",8,4,7,22 October 2007
"Monsters, Inc."," Pixar's glowing reputation takes yet another step forward
","First came Toy Story. It was cute, but lacked bite. The technology was new, and Pixar was still experimenting. Next came A Bug's Life. It was remarkable. Then came Toy Story 2. Even better! Now here is their fourth feature: Monsters Inc. I'm not sure that it's better than Toy Story 2, but at the very least it's equal. It doesn't compare with that film in terms of hilarity. Toy Story 2, in my opinion, is one of the funniest films of the past several years, if not the funniest. However, Monters Inc. has a couple of advantages over TS2 (and, I promise you, it is at least as funny as any other film from 2001). First, the animation is even better than TS2. What? What did you say? Shrek? Ugh, don't even mention that waste of hard-drive space. Monsters Inc. is simply gorgeous in its color schemes. And the movement of the characters is so smooth it looks almost as if it were just the best stop-motion animation ever created. In the film, there is a Japanese restaurant that the monsters go to that's named after the great stop-motion master Roy Harryhausen. I'm sure he'd be stunned at the accomplishment. Second, it has a couple of the most exciting sequences in animation history, especially the climactic sequence in the door room. That's a scene that'll go down in the books. And, third, it's perhaps the first Disney film since Dumbo to be touching, but not cloying. Although some people have told me that the one song in TS2 made them cry, I personally was cringing through that number. There's a scene in Monsters Inc. that honestly made me cry. Generally, that's not much. I'm easily moved. However, I don't fail to notice if a film is emotionally manipulative. That's not the case here. The only other Disney moment that really touched me that deeply is the 'Baby Mine' song from Dumbo. I think that the only people who don't cry during that song are convicts on death row. I really loved the characters in Monsters Inc. The relationship that develops between Sully and Boo is truly touching. It's developed in a very natural way. And it certainly helps that Boo is easily the cutest kid in the universe, even if she's not real. There were a lot of 'aww's in the theater, but they were coming from college students, not maddening parents trying to get their kids to pay attention. Oh! And did I mention that the film's villain is one of Disney's best? He's a chameleon-like monster named Raymond, voiced by Steve Buscemi. Sure, his motives aren't all that interesting, but I love the way he moves. It's amazing. And his face is so expressive, but not too expressive like the characters in, say, ahem, Shrek.As much as I would love to, I can't say that Monsters Inc. is a perfect film. There are a couple of flaws. The first fifteen minutes or so, basically until Boo wanders out into the monsters' world, are pretty boring. By this point, though, I was so amazed at the beauty of the artwork that I hardly cared. Also, most of the monsters aren't very interesting looking, that is, besides the colors. Raymond and the big boss of Monsters Inc., who is a spider-like creature, are the most interesting. Also, Billy Crystal's girlfriend in the film, a Medusa-like creature, with snakes for hair that copy her emotions, is very cool. Most of the other monsters are so cute that it's a wonder that they can scare children at all! (That's how they get fuel, by the way; children's screams power the monsters' world). Sully, for instance, who is the main character, more or less (the commercials concentrate on Billy Crystal's character more, for some reason; the logic must be that Billy Crystal is a bigger box office draw than big, fat John Goodman, a pretty insulting thought). Anyhow, Boo comes into the monsters' world because she thinks he is a giant kitty! We can't blame them too much for this, though. You know Disney would never produce a film that didn't have an ability to push their line of plush toys. Some of the monsters, though, are kind of boring. This is especially true with Mike, the little green cyclops ball played by Crystal. Sully could become a classic hero, and Raymond a classic villain, but it's doubtful Mike will stick in your head for as long. Crystal is, however, very funny in the film (and that might be the only time I'll ever say that!). He'll never be as boring as Shrek, nor as painful to listen to as Eddie Murphy as the donkey in Shrek. The story of Monsters Inc. is full of cliches, which is unfortunate. As I've been trying to point out, most everything else about the film is so inventive that it's not too noticeable, but it will never be unnoticeable. You'll see the revelation that the monsters have at the end two hours before the movie starts. Your youngest child might not figure it out, but anyone over eight will know as soon as it's humanly possible. There's also the kind of betrayal that's popping up so often now in animation, well, in all movies, really, that you can almost take it for granted anymore. And, heck, I would've predicted it myself if I weren't being so enormously entertained! If it weren't for these cliches, Monsters Inc. might have ended up earning the title as one of the best movies I had ever seen. Still, I'll never forget it! Now, what can Pixar possibly do to surpass this? 9/10.",9,7,13,18 February 2002
21 Jump Street," Quite funny
","Totally pretty good. No, it's never going to win Best Picture, but it's an amusing comedy. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are both great as dumb rookie cops who are sent back to high school undercover as students. Tatum screws up and exchanges his popular kid role for Hill's nerd, and both find out how the other half lives. Dave Franco (James' younger brother) is good as the environmentally-conscious villain, and Brie Larson (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World) is good as Hill's love interest. Rob Riggle and The Office's Ellie Kemper have nice roles as teachers (Chris Parnell, on the other hand, feels wasted) and Ice Cube and Nick Offerman (Parks & Recreation) are great as the officers' superiors. Sure, it's pretty sloppy, but it's funny and clever where it counts.",7,2,3,10 April 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," Pretty good
","Another quite good comic book movie. Like this summer's Thor and X-Men: First Class, it's far better than it needs to be. Captain America is one of the cornier superheroes, and the film does a good job of playing with that. Chris Evans is good (though I do miss the cleverness he exhibited in Fantastic Four, in which he was about the only good thing) as Steve Rogers, a 90lb weakling (created through some good CGI effects) who undergoes an experiment to make him a superman. Although he immediately exhibits heroics, no one knows what to do with him, so they just use him as a war bond salesman. He feels kind of worthless about it, especially at USO shows where he just ends up as the butt of jokes by weary servicemen who would rather just see the dancers come back on stage. Soon enough, he gets another opportunity to be a hero, and, after that, he becomes a full-fledged soldier with an elite team to fight Hydra, a secret Nazi scientific organization working on super-powered weaponry (Hugo Weaving and Toby Jones are great as the villain Red Skull and his lead scientific mind). The film is quite respectful to the era and WWII (it easily could have come off as insulting), while still being an exciting and fun modern action flick. Hayley Atwell is quite good as Evans' love interest. Also co-starring Tommy Lee Jones and Stanley Tucci.",7,0,1,6 November 2011
American Hustle," A great Scorsese imitation
","David O. Russell does Scorsese, and he does it pretty damn well. Christian Bale stars as a con artist who, along with his girlfriend, Amy Adams, is forced by FBI agent Bradley Cooper to work for him. He wants to use their talent at scamming to rope in bigger targets, and he sets his eyes on Camden, New Jersey mayor Jeremy Renner, who wants to get gambling legalized in New Jersey. Bale and Adams have little choice but to go along with it, but waiting in the wings is Bale's loudmouth wife, Jennifer Lawrence, who keeps trying to horn her way into their shenanigans and ruin the whole plan. The story here - which is based on real events, at least somewhat - isn't the greatest, but the film is an absolute tour de force, bolstered by some truly brilliant performances and an assured hand behind the camera. There isn't a better cast this year. In addition to the four I've listed, comedian Louis C.K. is just brilliant in the deadpan role of Cooper's disapproving boss. The film is funny and just plain fun. I think the final twist is kind of predictable, and it kind of limps to the end, but this is great stuff.",9,4,11,31 December 2013
Top Secret!," Underrated Comedy Classic
","Top Secret seems to have little place in the Zuckers/Abraham/Zuckers team's career. It does not seem to be as successful as other films of theirs. In fact, it seems wedged right in between the extremely well respected Airplane! and its sequel and the Naked Gun series. Everyone has seen all five of those films, but only those who have caught it on Comedy Central seem to have seen Top Secret. I don't know why it occupies such a low tier. I believe that it is at least as funny as the classics Airplane! and The Naked Gun, if not a bit above them. There is one hilarious sequence after another with a few misses, but what are you going to do? All of these types of films hit and miss with their jokes, and Top Secret hits with about 90% of its jokes. Who could forget the Skeet Surfing song at the beginning? Who could forget the bull sequence? Or how about the ballet sequence? The underwater cowboy fight sequence? Oh, and, probably its most well remembered sequence, the backwards-Swedish sequence, a marvel in film history. I give Top Secret a 9/10, the same that I gave both Airplane! and The Naked Gun.",9,1,3,27 July 2000
Rush," Exhilarating
","Chris Hemsworth stars as James Hunt and Daniel Bruhl (whom you may remember as the lovestruck Nazi soldier in Inglourious Basterds) as Niki Lauda, two Formula 1 race car drivers in the 1970s who had a fierce rivalry. It's the classic clash of psychologies setup: Hemsworth is a fun-loving womanizer who races for the thrill, while Bruhl is the strict disciplinarian. There's nothing really surprising or deep about this movie, but, my lord, is it excellent. It's just a great example of straightforward, Hollywood filmmaking, perfectly put together in every way. The racing scenes are exhilarating, but it's really the great lead performances that impress the most. You almost have to hate Hemsworth. How can anyone be as handsome as he is and as good an actor? Bruhl gave perhaps the most undervalued performance in Inglourious Basterds, and this movie proves he ought to be a huge star.",9,4,6,29 September 2013
Nightcrawler," Fantastic, with a brilliant, brilliant lead performance
","Man, this year is giving us some extremely entertaining films. Nightcrawler follows a Los Angeleno with no conscious (redundant?), Jake Gyllenhaal, as he finds his professional calling as a 'stringer,' someone who films accidents and violent crimes and then sells the footage to the morning news. Man, is Gyllenhaal a scumbag in this movie! One of the biggest sociopaths in film history, the film is mostly amusing because it's just a blast to watch this slimy bastard work. This is not only his best work, but probably the best lead performance from an actor I've seen so far this year. As he gets better at his job, he gets bolder and bolder and thinks nothing of manipulating crime scenes (if he can get away with it) to get the better shot, and even the better story. Rene Russo plays the news director he directly deals with. Kevin Rahm (of Mad Men fame) plays the only person at the station with any conscience, so of course he is completely ignored. Riz Ahmed is also excellent as Gyllenhaal's assistant and protégé - kind of a goofy idiot, but it's fun to watch Jake bounce off of him. Any flaws are very, very minor, and I'd easily call this one of the great films of 2014, so far my second favorite (surpassing Gone Girl but not The Grand Budapest Hotel).",10,7,16,2 November 2014
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," A lot of fun
","Amusing mockumentary in the vein of Spinal Tap. Andy Sandberg stars as vapid pop star Conner, who came to popularity through a hip-hop group he founded with his two best friends (the other two members of Lonely Island and the directors of the film, Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone) but who has recently gone solo. Taccone has stayed on as his DJ, but he mostly just plays music through his iPod at concerts. Schaffer was infuriated with Conner's behavior and has gone rustic and become a farmer. The film is very silly and a lot of fun, with plenty of great gags, hilarious songs, and entertaining cameos. I do think it runs out of steam as it nears the end - it has to wrap up the plot and becomes semi-serious, and it kind of harms the momentum. I must beg AMPAS to recognize 'I'm So Humble' and/or 'Equal Rights' for Best Original Song next year.",8,7,24,5 June 2016
The Aviator," Great work by Scorsese and his cast
","Well directed biopic of Howard Hughes that's probably too ambitious and original to be called a biopic. This is simply the story of Hughes' early, gigantic life where he imagined giant movies, glamorous women, and futuristic airplanes, but was crippled by an obsessive-compulsive disorder. Sure, this isn't Scorsese's most personal film, but I never quite thought of him as a straight auteur. A lot of his films do share common themes, but there's always Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, The Age of Innocence, and After Hours. I think of Scorsese first and foremost as a master of the medium, an especially skilled director, and I think The Aviator is one of his greatest directorial triumphs. He is a master of developing the mood of the picture and controlling its pace. It flows beautifully. The film boasts some of the very best acting of the year, too. Leonardo DiCaprio is just coming into his mature period as an actor, and this is his best performance to date. It's definitely Oscar worthy. Cate Blanchett is a marvel playing Katharine Hepburn. At first I wasn't sure if she was just doing a crass imitation, but her character really develops nicely. Cate disappears and we then have Kate. Just try to keep her from carrying home the statuette! Another Kate, Kate Beckinsale, is also very good as Ava Gardener. She's not a great actress, but she holds her own here. Add to them fine supporting performances from John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, and Ian Holm. Also Jude Law, in his fiftieth film appearance of 2004, plays Errol Flynn and is so good that I wanted a lot more. I love films about Golden Age Hollywood, and I like trying to spot the references. One of the best and most entertaining movies of 2004 thus far. 9/10.",9,3,8,27 December 2004
Burn After Reading," Very weak for the Coens
","I was kind of hoping for another brilliant one-two punch after No Country for Old Men, like Fargo and The Big Lebowski, but Burn After Reading has the feel of being written and made quickly and without much refining. Structurally, it's most like Lebowski, in that it's about a bunch of people mixed up in stuff that is beyond them, mostly nobodies finding themselves in a convoluted spy plot. The joke is that no one really knows that it's all much ado about nothing. The story has Frances MacDormand and Brad Pitt finding a CD with what they think is sensitive information on it. They think they can blackmail John Malkovich, to whom they believe the CD belongs. Meanwhile, George Clooney is screwing around with both Malkovich's wife, Tilda Swinton, and MacDormand, while being married to another woman entirely. Unlike Lebowski, Burn After Reading never bothered to involve me, or be very funny, for that matter. Brad Pitt is the only one who really gets laughs. His meeting with Malkovich, most of which you'll have seen in the commercials, was pretty great. Besides the goofy plot, there's nothing here even resembling the Coen Brothers; no stylish cinematography, little repeatable dialogue. Even Carter Burwell's score feels like it was written in an afternoon, and it sounds a lot like an earlier Coens score, I think Barton Fink. It's most likely their least memorable movie, with the possible exception of The Ladykillers.",8,14,29,14 September 2008
Watchmen," Very good adaptation
","This might be the only movie that interested me so much with its previews that I read the book on which it was based before the movie was released. I had always heard about Watchmen, and, though not a comic book guy, I checked it out. It was good, quite good, though I balk, more than just a little, whenever anyone refers to it as great literature. That it was included in Time magazine's top 100 best novels of the 20th Century seems ludicrous to me. I found it rather sloppy overall and so in tune with its non-literary medium that I don't think it was an especially good work of literature. But I did like it. Now I've finally seen the movie. And I liked it. Very much, in fact. I thought it was a cracking adaptation of the comic book, and it moved along seamlessly. Its screenplay is surprisingly well adapted. Many of the film's flaws are inherent in the source material. There are some incredibly stupid scenes, like the sex scene and Dr. Manhattan's interview. Both are identical in the book. I might complain that the violence is a little more in focus in the movie. I wonder how well someone who hasn't read the original would understand this. The friend I saw it with said he had no problems, so maybe it's just in the details that it becomes obscure. The end of this film is far better than that of the original work, which comes out of left field and makes little sense. Actually, I did kind of like that, because it was enjoyably weird, but the film version works much better. As for the cast, I was surprised by how well Patrick Wilson played Night Owl II  I didn't think he had it in him. As everyone seems to agree, the weakest link was Malin Akerman as Laurie Jupiter. Akerman comes off as kind of a bimbo, at least with how she speaks, which is nothing like the book's Jupiter.",8,1,4,22 March 2009
Hot Rod," Utterly hilarious
","I had flirted with the idea of seeing this film when it was in theaters, then again when it hit DVD, but somehow never got around to it. I don't even remember why I put it up at the top of my Netflix queue. Must have seen it referenced somewhere and my interest was renewed. I'm ecstatic that I finally caught up to it, though. It's hilarious! This generation of Saturday Night Live is pretty dismal, but one of the few good things about it is Andy Sandberg and his digital shorts. They aren't always great, but they're weird and frequently inspired. He stars in this movie about a man who wants to follow in his dead father's footsteps and become a stuntman. In a very common plot for SNL players, Sandberg's stepfather is going to die if he doesn't get a heart transplant. That'll cost 50 grand, and Sandberg thinks that, if he completes one awesome stunt, he'll make the money needed. Much as all of the movies like this (e.g., Dirty Work, which starred Norm MacDonald), the plot is very secondary. Jokes are first. And jokes about the lameness of the plot are hugely encouraged. In fact, Sandberg only wants to heal his stepdad (Ian McShane) because he wants to kick his butt just once in a fair fight before he dies. Isla Fisher plays Sandberg's love interest, but his desires are thwarted by ultra-windbag Will Arnet, one of the funniest men on Earth. He brings this stereotypical character to ridiculous heights of meta-comedy. Danny McBride, Bill Hader and Jorma Taccone co-star as Sandberg's wacky crew. McBride and Hader have become sure-fire signs of a great comedy. There are so many great bits in Hot Rod: the crazy dancing Asian guy, Bill Hader's calm recollection of his acid trip, a fight between a taco and a grilled cheese sandwich, Sandberg 'punch-dancing' his rage out. Little of it comes close to being describable. It's weird and wild, and sure to be something of a cult comedy classic.",8,1,5,22 March 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," If this is the Star Wars of my generation...
","and Harry Potter is the Wizard of Oz of my generation, then my generation is truly pathetic.Okay, it's not like FotR is a bad movie. In my opinion, the first two hours are flawed but very entertaining. It is the third hour where it gets really clunky, repetitive, and nonsensical. First off, I have not read the books. I claim that as an advantage, since I cannot criticize the filmmakers for skipping my favorite parts. No one else should be doing this either, but it is inevitable. But my first major criticism has to do with the novels. This film has the same setback that all fantasy novels do - too many characters. It works better in novels, to be sure, but it certainly is a disadvantage to a film. I knew only about three or four names among the main characters by the end. Also, character development is impossible here. I knew only two characters by the end of the movie: Gandolf and Bilbo. You wanna know why? Because the actors who played them, Ian McKellen and Ian Holm, are masters. Their characters are not developed in dialogue, but by acting. Elijah Wood is almost there. None of the others comes close, although Liv Tyler didn't seem too bad (her character was too small here to judge well). It's also true that none of the situations were at all well developed. The whole film feels rushed, which we might expect in a movie based on a long novel. That still isn't forgivable. A lot of references get thrown out in the air with little explanation, and I heard several groups of viewers talking amongst themselves to see what was going on.But that's not all. There's plenty to criticize elsewhere as well. The story itself is lame. Let me guess: another uber-evil villain wants to control the world. How uninteresting can you get? I guess these novels may have started that trend, although I doubt that. Still, it was lame when Tolkien invented it and it's still lame in fantasy novels today. Then there's the cinematography: it's repetitive. The novel's structure is basically one of an endless parade of locales, and the basic shot is an aerial view of the umpteen good guys walking in a straight line across whatever locale they've reached. Peter Jackson must have spent at least half of the 16 months it took to make these three films sitting in a helicopter! Also, the battle scenes are ridiculous. Anyone who complains when the rebels live in the battle scenes in Star Wars, or how the Storm Troopers always miss is going to laugh themselves silly when they see these nine fellows, four of whom barely fight (the hobbits), dispatch hundreds of drooling orcs in a matter of ten minutes. So what did I like? Well, some of the action sequences are awfully entertaining, despite their ludicrousness. I especially like the special effects of the troll, and his fight with the group. That was very exciting. To further criticize the poor structure, I felt that the Balrog sequence was quite boring after that. It looked far too much like the devil from Fantasia's Night on Bald Mountain number. The Balrog in the Ralph Bakshi cartoon looked much cooler, actually. The showdown between Balrog and Gandolf was rather lame considering. I also liked the lovingly created and detailed locales, except for the Shire, which is boring. But most of everything else was great. The Ring Wraiths were pretty cool. I especially liked the way everything looked when Frodo puts on the ring.
Other than those scant things, this was a huge disappointment considering the recent imdb fiasco. This truly is a blight on our great site. Embarrassing to the highest degree. 6/10.",9,3,11,26 December 2001
Cast Away," I'm raising my vote to 10/10
","I have commented on Cast Away before, so, if you actually want to see my opinion about this film's content, see my previous comment. Right here, after the third time I've seen the film, I just have to say this: not for at least the past twenty years has a more emotionally and artistically satisfying motion picture been made in Hollywood. If I should ever meet Tom Hanks or any of the other artists involved in making this film, I would just have to hug them.",10,2,4,16 June 2001
Cast Away," Very impressive
","I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. i kind of assumed it would be a melodrama not unlike Forrest Gump. And that is how it began. I thought it was going to be a very formulaic movie about a man who survives for a while on a desert island, escapes, and then reclaims his love. Fortunately, it is much more complicated than that.Zemeckis and Hanks take a lot of risks in this film. There is a great lack of dialogue. This will alienate a large portion of the audience who is used to inane dialogue. They do find a way around it after a short while, by making a volleyball into a nonspeaking character with whom Hanks can converse. This does not particularly help the majority of the audience to get more involved in the film. In fact, to most people, it provided comic relief. There were many in the theater who laughed whenever the volleyball, Wilson, made an appearance. To a certain extent, it was supposed to be funny. actually, there were several parts that made me laugh. To a certain other extent, they were completely serious.****************BIG TIME SPOILERS******************several important critics have claimed that the last segment of the film is anticlimactic, where Hanks is rescued and has to reconcile with Helen Hunt, the love of his life, after a prolonged period of mourning and supposedly false hope married another man. Roger Ebert expressed his dislike for this section of the film. I don't think he or any other critics with similar criticisms were paying any attention. Yes, the survival stuff on the island was very exciting and interesting to watch, but the final sequence anchors the film and makes it truly special. Hanks' meeting with Hunt is so overwhelmingly powerful that it brought me to tears. For God's sake, the only thing that kept him alive on the island was her picture. Don't you realize that to leave us without a resolution on the most important plot point is going to disable the film profoundly? The scene where they meet is masterful. It is extremely realistic and subtle in its emotions. This must be Tom Hank's best performance, and probably Hunt's also (although she was masterful in As Good As It Gets, too). She is not in Cast Away for very long, but I think she should be considered for an Oscar. And since Hanks has won for far less good roles (i.e., Philadelphia, one of the most terrible pieces of garbage ever made in Hollywood), to not nominate him would be sad, and I am usually a Hanks detractor (I like him, but find him too unaffecting usually).The finale of Cast Away has been equally debated. In my opinion, it was a small, symbolic, but tacked-on event: the delivery of a package that he decided not to open on the island because it had angel wings drawn on the side of the box. I don't care how symbolically the character interpreted the wings as being, that package could have contained something very useful and it would be ridiculous not to open it. I am very glad that the film did not end with Hanks trying to get the woman in the truck whose package he delivered. The real ending is actually quite beautiful. Roger Ebert calls the final moment of the film, a smile, 'forced whimsy.' I did not notice a smile. I did not interpret his expression as a smile in the least. Instead, it was a look of farewell. His character is now letting go. He is choosing to no longer try to run his own fate, but just allow himself to be taken along where the world takes him. Through his ordeal, he knows that it is foolish to try to control fate. The final decision he has to make is which of the four ways to go. It ends quite beautifully.********************END SPOILER**************************I do have a couple of complaints: the film begins very poorly with some very silly and formulaic scenes that establish Hanks' businessman ethics. If you ever find yourself on your knee outside of a car window about to propose to your girlfriend mere minutes before you step on a plane, stop and think about it. You are obviously setting yourself up for an imminent death. Please avoid this situation at all costs. The movie plot gods will strike you down, I promise you. The biggest pain in the neck in this movie was the CONSTANT, NEVERENDING stream of product placements in this film. It should have had a large credit at the beginning of the film: Producer - Fed Ex. Tom Hanks' character is a Fed Ex exec, and the beginning of the film spends an outrageous amount of time telling the audience how good Fed Ex is. '87 hours? We might as well be the U.S. Mail.' I once ordered something to be delivered by Fed Ex. They came four days after the company had told me they had shipped it. They came to my door, rang the doorbell which I cannot hear in my room, and walked away without even knocking at the door. I later found a note on my door that said that they would try again on the next delivery day, Monday, three days later, between the hours of 8am and 4pm. The U.S. Mail generally arrives at my house approximately 3 days after a company ships it, and even on a saturday. The only other problem is an annoying third act speech, the sort of speech that reveals the point of the movie, even though everyone in the audience should have already figured the meaning out already. I still give this film a 9/10. It is the best Hollywood film of the year, and is the only Oscar type film to deserve even consideration for most anything.",10,0,0,28 December 2000
The Thing," An equal to Alien
","This stands next to Alien and Invasion of the Body Snatchers '78 as one of the great horror/sci-fi hybrids of the era. The film takes place in an American research base in Antarctica. A Norwegian helicopter chases an escaped sled dog into camp, shooting at it with a rifle. When the shooter wounds one of the Americans, they kill him in self-defense. It's probably not the smartest move, seeing as how insanely the Norwegians were trying to kill it, but the Americans take the dog in. Little do they know it's not a dog at all, but an alien life form mimicking a dog. Soon it reveals its true form  kind of  and is burned to death. Unfortunately, it's a crafty organism and has likely infected one or more of the men. But how could you know? It's a perfect mimic, pretty much undetectable until it's too late. The film features some of the best special effects of its time  they have not dated a bit, and are every bit as creepy and nasty as they were in 1982. The monster, when it reveals itself, is a true Lovecraftian thing that takes on all kinds of forms, probably an amalgam of the different organisms it has mimicked over its lifetime. Put the monster aside, though, and there's this great, intense study of paranoia. 'Nobody trusts anybody' as star Kurt Russell puts it. Reminiscent of perhaps The Big Sleep, if you closely scrutinize the series of events, the plot makes no sense. There's no conceivable way the persons who eventually end up as the thing could have become it. But this lack of logic itself is part of why the movie is so horrifying. You never can tell who is or who is not an alien. Carpenter wisely never lets the audience see anything. Kudos to him for that. And also kudos to him for including two black characters who don't die in the first ten minutes of the movie, an almost unheard of feat for an African American person in a 1980s (or '90s or even '00s) horror movie! A masterpiece of the genre.",10,13,18,9 March 2008
The Revenant," Gripping but overlong
","Some of the best cinema of the year, but it goes on for too long and starts crumbling by the end. It's a simple revenge flick mixed with a survivalist tale. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as a frontiersman with a half Indian son who has been hired to guide a group of trappers. After suffering an attack by Indians, DiCaprio is mauled by a bear. Unable to travel further, two men, Tom Hardy and Will Poulter, along with DiCaprio's son, stay behind to care for him until he dies, as they assume he will. Hardy doesn't really feel like it, though, so at the first opportunity he murders the son, tells Poulter (who didn't witness the murder) that the Indians are nearby, and buries DiCaprio in a shallow grave, still alive. DiCaprio eventually digs his way out and goes after Hardy to get his sweet, sweet revenge. The film is at its best when its in its you-are-there, in-the-actors'-faces phase, making you feel like part of the action. Its at its worst when it goes into flashbacks and DiCaprio's highly symbolic dreams. The final act is pretty silly, too. Domhnall Gleeson, who has really earned a vacation at this point, also co-stars.",8,3,8,11 January 2016
American Psycho," Great, except for the end
","For most of this film's run, I was in agreement with those who have named this one of the films of the decade. It's just exuberant, hilarious, gripping and spot-on. I'm very vocal in my dislike of Christian Bale's acting style - it feels way too old fashioned to me (if he had been acting in the '50s and '60s, he'd definitely be among the best actors of his time, but nowadays, it just comes off as ridiculously methody), but American Psycho is pitched as a cartoon, and he fits in well. Most of the set-pieces are tremendous, most notably his axe murder set to Huey Lewis' 'Hip to Be Square'. I love every time he goes into the super-long descriptions of the music and artists he's listening to. The problem is, after the climactic sequence, the film takes the kind of twist that was all too prominent between the late '90s and today. Suffice it to say, it's not much more interesting than, 'It was all just a dream'. It flops to the floor like a dead fish and then ends. Definitely disappointing in that way, but I can totally dig the bulk of the movie.",8,2,5,6 December 2009
Little Miss Sunshine," What the... Terrible!
","I don't know where to begin with this one. It starts off well enough, and goes on that way for fifty minutes or so. Never great, I'd say, but it's a perfectly acceptable little indie comedy. Alan Arkin and Steve Carell are both excellent, and Toni Collette and Greg Kinnear are fine, too. But then it takes a majorly wrong turn (think grandma from National Lampoon's Vacation, miscalculated at an astronomical level), follows that up with some incredibly forced bits and ends up at one of the most outrageously appalling climaxes I have seen in a long time. I went from moderately enjoying it to downright hating it. It's too bad, too, because I do like some of the things it's trying to say, some of the things it's trying to do. But what a disaster! I guess I'm the only one who feels that way, though. My movie-going companion (whose opinion I respect, I should add) was enamored with the picture all the way through, even laughing uproariously at what I thought were some of the most cringe-inducing moments in some time. It's already ranked on IMDb's top 250, though that's hardly a sign of high quality. Oh well. I'm happy enough in hating it. Easily the worst I've seen so far this year.",3,47,102,28 August 2006
Knowing," P.O.S., but stylishly directed by Proyas
","This movie has been in production for several years, so it isn't too surprising that it retains the Bush-era old time religious overtones, comparable to a film like The Exorcism of Emily Rose. Knowing really is only one step away from Christian dreck like the Left Behind series (that one step would be the casting of Kirk Cameron). That's really only a small objection. One can easily ignore or laugh away that stuff. The real crime of Knowing is that it's just plain dull most of the time. It takes forever to get anywhere. Nicolas Cage steps into that old canard that is the atheist who became so after his wife died (wanna bet he'll find his faith again by the end of the film?). He's a single father now, and a complete non-believer. But his belief in science is challenged when he comes into possession of a note from a time capsule. It is just a long string of numbers, but he starts to notice a pattern. Many of the numbers announce specific dates on which enormous disasters occurred. When he has it all figured out, he makes sure to experience the next couple of disasters firsthand. The final numbers on the note indicate the apocalypse that will take 'everyone else'. Intriguing enough, but the film is bogged down by endless expository dialogue and some ridiculously obscure, villain-ish people who stalk Cage's son (as well as a little girl they meet later on; not really worth getting into). The film does have one thing going for it: director Alex Proyas. The guy really seems to have had only one film in him, 1997's awesome Dark City. He wrote that; he didn't write this. But a crappy movie like this at least demonstrates he has some major talent. The film looks great all the way through. The two least boring parts of the film are the two disasters Cage encounters, one a plane crash and the other a subway car derailing, are two of the most vivid disasters ever caught on film. I object to both of them morally, because Proyas seems to delight way too much in people burning to death and being squished by the train, but they are definitely exciting and well done (the dream sequence with the flaming forest animals, not so much). All in all, it's a stupid, ugly movie, but at least it doesn't feel like it was made by an idiot, like X-Men Origins: Wolverine or Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen.",4,2,5,12 July 2009
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Falls short of the first two in intelligence, but it's excellent summer fare
","It doesn't quite reach the levels of the first two installments, and, indeed, it often seems like little more than a quick cashing in on those films, but Terminator 3, for everything it's not, proves to be one of the most entertaining summer blockbusters in recent memory. The action sequences are a lot of fun; they are unbelievable and preposterous, but that doesn't detract from the visceral entertainment they provide. The Terminator and his enemy, the T-X, get the hell banged out of them as they are hit by numerous vehicles, are thrown about, and live through enormous explosions. The T-X does lack the menace of Arnold Schwarzenegger's original Terminator and the liquid terminator of T2, but, heck, I'm all about sexy terminatrices. Kristanna Loken is not a good actress, but she's sexy. She gets to wear red leather through the whole movie, and she can even increase her bust size on command. This film has a great B-movie quality to it in that way. An element of humor has been added to this film. In a way, I like the seriousness of the first two films. Terminator is a study in narrative economy, and it doesn't take time out to joke. Terminator 2 sticks to its convictions, however paranoid, and that was refreshing for a film of its type. Terminator 3 is a little smarmy with its humor, but, for the most part, its jokes succeeded in making me laugh. I love how he gets his leather jacket in this movie is very funny. I could have done without the endless parodying of Schwarzenegger's famous lines from the first two films, especially `I'll be back,' which has a dozen variations here. As for the acting, not much is required, of course. I'm very upset that Ed Furlong isn't back for this one. What better did he have to do? Nick Stahl is a poor replacement, and this is probably my major complaint with the movie. Clair Danes is a weird creature. I've always been biased against her ever since she starred in My So Called Life. She isn't a particularly good actress, but she's been improving, however slowly. What's especially odd is that she's actually getting more and more gawky as she ages. She was beautiful as a teenager, and, while still very attractive, I'd take the younger version. I suppose it's unfair to critique her looks. Her performance is fine. Nothing special, as with the other actors. The script generally writes itself (it's more or less a constant chase, much like the first movie), but it does have an inspired third act. If you enjoy action movies, jump into a matinee, enjoy the air conditioning, the popcorn, and the explosions. 8/10.",8,1,2,5 July 2003
The Orphanage," Good, but not that good
","Good, but I was expecting better given the reviews. It's about at the same level as, say, The Others. Belén Rueda plays an adult orphan who now lives in her former orphanage with her husband and adopted son. Her son speaks of imaginary friends, which she and her husband find normal. But these imaginary friends, it starts to seem, may really be ghosts. One day, the son vanishes, and Rueda thinks the ghosts may have something to do with it. The film is quite spooky, but I think the eeriness is pretty much ruined by an overzealous musical score. This really needed to be more subtle. The script has a couple of great twists, but, in general, it's fairly poor. It contains scenes where characters sit around and spout out endless exposition. Home movies are discovered which provide endless clues to the mystery. The most annoying flaw is that police and detectives are brought in to solve the case, and they find nothing. Later on, Rueda discovers all kinds of obvious clues that police searching for a missing child wouldn't have left uncovered. The final twist, I think, is particularly brilliant, but the movie lost me again with a lousy, sentimental ending.",7,0,3,25 May 2008
Doctor Zhivago," Good but very flawed film
","This isn't one of those classics that you just have to see. In fact, you could live the rest of your life very happily without ever having seen it, even if you are a major film buff. There are plenty of other films you could see in its stead, and, with the time you would save by skipping this 3 hour and 20 minute opus, you could watch two better films. SPOILERSStill, Doctor Zhivago is worthwhile. It is very well directed, as you can only expect from David Lean. The score is justifiably famous. The cinematography is also quite glorious at times. I wish I could say the same for the writing. The film's dramatic angle revolves around an affair between Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif) and Lara (Julie Christie), a woman, not his wife, whom he meets and grows to admire during medical services for WWI. Unfortunately, the film never really develops their relationship. I never felt any dramatic weight when the two were separated or when they found each other after long lapses. I am a definite weeper when it comes to romantic epics, but I didn't come anywhere close to shedding tear one during this film. In fact, I was always disappointed that the screenplay (or novel, really) kept pushing Yuri away from his wife, Tanya (Geraldine Chaplin), who always seemed better to me. Besides, as I have said, there really is never a reason why Yuri would abandon Tanya.Most of these feelings come from the poor character development. Yuri himself is developed decently, but some of his decisions seem unrealistic and forced. The two women in his life are the biggest problem Tanya seems left cold by the writers, and I suspect she is this way just so we end up not sympathizing with her, or at least so we end up wanting Zhivago to go to Lara. But Lara is not well developed either. Her situation at the beginning is very interesting, but after we meet up with her again during WWI, she doesn't really seem the same. Worse yet, the man whom she originally married, Pasha, is swept away during the war to live a different life. We meet up with him a couple of times along the way, but he is only a plot device. Lara never seems affected by his loss. The two characters who do register are supporting ones, Yevgraf Zhivago (Alec Guinness) (Yuri's half-brother whom he hardly knows and only meets a couple of times) and Komarovsky (Rod Steiger). A lot of the difficulty in character association is the fault of the actors, though. Omar Sharif is good as Yuri, but not great. Geraldine Chaplin, a very underrated actress indeed (she was the daughter of Charlie Chaplin, and, if you wish to see her act in a film, see Nashville, made a decade later), is cruelly underutilized. It is her remarkable acting skill that allowed her character to live at all and that made me identify with Tanya rather than with Lara. And Guinness and Steiger steal every scene they are in, both great at playing characters with ambiguous morality.In fact, I have to lay a lot of the blame on the general failure of the film on Christie. She is a great actress elsewhere, but she fumbles here. Big time. She plays Lara as someone with deep stares. But those stares, meant to exhibit longing or profundity or whatever come off more as blank and thoughtless. Christie clearly doesn't know what to do with the part. I don't know how early this was in her career, but she was definitely not ready for it. Her character, though underwritten, could have at least seemed passionate towards Yuri, but there is never an ounce of chemistry involved. If you want to see her as a mature actress, catch Robert Altman's McCabe and Mrs. Miller, where she plays the titular Miller. She's riveting there.Besides these major flaws, I'd still recommend it to anyone who loves David Lean or epics or even Alec Guinness or Rod Steiger. It is worth watching just for Guinness' subtle performance. But be prepared to sit for a prolonged period of time. If it gets boring, just concentrate on the pretty pictures and music. However, if you want to skip onto some of its descendants, see Warren Beatty's Reds or Philip Kaufmann's The Unbearable Lightness of Being. They both have some similarities in theme and setting with Doctor Zhivago, and they are much more thought out and beautiful. 7/10.",7,1,7,18 July 2001
American Beauty," Great, but certainly no masterpiece
","I am shocked at the great reception American Beauty has gotten on the IMDB. #2, only behind the Godfather!?!? Come on! It was great, to be sure, but all of the film's sentiments have been expressed before, and better. The decaying family relationships were stated in the better film The Ice Storm. The idea that even in terrible situations, life is still beautiful was brilliantly shown in (what else!) Life is Beautiful! The one thing that the film did succeed in doing extremely well is the composition of shots. Watch the scene where the neighbor boy records Thora Burch with his video camera. We see the boy on the far left of the screen, staring at her offscreen. Burch stares out at the audience from the television. That is one perfect shot! There are several great scenes like this.The part of the film which truly bothered me, though, was the way they handled the inevitable shooting. Throughout the film, we watch every important character talk about killing Spacey, and we see them all next to guns. This set up reminded me of the 'Who Shot Mr. Burns' episode of the Simpsons. I don't know about the rest of you, but I thought it was rather obvious who the killer was going to be. I think Mendes put way too much emphasis on the murder which he set up at the beginning (and by the way, did he have to tell us all this at the beginning in the first place?). No one could have screwed up the amazing payoff at the end of the film though. i believe the main reason this film touched so many people must be the last scene. It is truly remarkable to behold!",8,1,3,15 November 1999
Warrior," Clichéd sports movie with some good points
","A very cliché sports story, with so many corny moments that you'll have seen in six dozen other films that it becomes ludicrous long before its end. Yet, in some ways, it's pretty well done, and it nearly overcomes those clichés. Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy play two brothers who parted ways way back when they were teenagers. Hardy went away with his mother and later joined the Marines after she passed away. Now he has returned to his father (Nick Nolte), a former drunk who drove his family apart. Edgerton didn't like his father much, either, but chose not to go with his brother and mother because he was in love with the woman he would eventually marry (Jennifer Morrison). Both brothers are skilled fighters and have their eyes set on the big prize in a mixed martial arts tournament. The film somewhat succeeds because it's very low-key. Most of the time, it's hard to notice how melodramatic and predictable the story is. The performances help, too (Joel Edgerton was my favorite of the three big characters). After a while, though, we get stuff like a wife who refuses to watch the fight impatiently pacing behind her cell phone, on a table in the foreground, waiting for a call to tell her her husband has won a match. And Hardy's story is beyond ridiculous - he gets invited to the tournament after beating up a trained MMA champion in a local gym - never mind that Hardy, at best, was just a trained wrestler many years ago in high school. Being in the Marines does not give you superpowers. That's just the start of the ridiculousness that ends up, obviously, with the two brothers fighting in the ring (with Edgerton's wife, at this point, of course watching from ringside). I should probably call Gavin O'Connor one of the best directors of the year, because, as over-the-top as all this stuff is (and, believe me, I barely scratched the surface - the movie runs for 2 hours and 20 minutes), it generally doesn't feel that way. If one doesn't look too closely at it, I could imagine it seeming great. But it's not.",6,65,122,9 February 2012
Salt," Dunderheaded action picture
","It almost seems as if it were scheduled to make up for the headiness of Chris Nolan's Inception (yeah, I know, it wasn't THAT smart, but compared to the vast majority of American blockbusters...). It's pretty much a Bourne rip-off. It stars Angelina Jolie as a CIA agent who is exposed as a Russian sleeper agent by a Russian defector. Whether she is one or not, her bosses (Chiwetel Ejiofor and Liev Schreiber) decide to keep her under wraps. She'll have none of that, though, as she fears for the safety of her spider expert husband. So basically, like Bourne, it's about a defecting agent running from her employers while simultaneously trying to foil the bad guys. The film does have a couple of semi-clever twists, but it also contains a metric ton of stupidity. There's no real set-up for Jolie being some kind of Bourne-like superwoman, yet as soon as the action sequences start she's either MacGuiver or Jackie Chan. Weighing in at about 95 pounds (seriously, Angie, eat a burger) she's able to beat the everloving crap out of every trained CIA, FBI or Secret Service agent who gets in her way. The filmmaking is reminiscent of Bourne, but, unlike Bourne, the choreography is confusing and implausible. Very little of the plot makes any sense, from the reason for the initial exposure to Jolie's motivations to the final sequence. Any moderate examination reveals the film to make no sense whatsoever.",5,116,188,25 July 2010
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Slight but occasionally hilarious
","After seeing The TV Set earlier this week, I was especially interested in seeing the followup film from director Jake Kasdan and producer Judd Apatow. The biopic is definitely a genre in much need of a spoofing, and I figured Kasdan and Apatow, with the often brilliant John C. Reilly in the lead, would produce a spoof with perhaps a little more depth than other films of the genre. But, alas, Walk Hard walks about the same line as the Hot Shot movies, somewhat below The Naked Gun and somewhat above Scary Movie. It's funny for the most part, but painfully two-dimensional. It does have some nice jokes concerning the history of pop music that might bypass the younger generations. I especially loved when Dewey Cox went through his Brian Wilson period. The recording session of his Pet Sounds-like album is just great. 'I need an army of didjeridoos!' Perhaps the funniest joke of the film are the various music stars of the era whose personae are occupied by celebrities in cameos. I actually wish they had gone even further with this, covering as many musicians as they could. The moment of the film that made me laugh the most is when Frankie Muniz, the kid from Malcolm in the Middle, appears as Buddy Holly. The casting is truly inspired, and I just love the way every phony celebrity is called by both their first name and last name every time they are mentioned, like, 'Well hello, Buddy Holly' or 'How are you doing, Paul McCartney?' The entire sequence where Cox meets The Beatles in India had me holding my sides. That could have gone on for longer. There are a lot of other jokes that cracked me up, as well. The entire first sequence, where we see the obligatory tragedy that sets Cox's life in motion, is hilarious. The recurring joke where, whenever Dewey gets especially upset, he finds the nearest bathroom sink, rips it out, and smashes it on the ground is one that is close to my heart. It seems that there are at least two Oscar clips of actors or, more commonly, actresses, smashing dishes on the ground when they are angry. And, if you want to see something extremely rare, Tim Meadows is hilarious in another recurring joke, where Cox walks in on him doing drugs in a back room (a direct parody of Ray) and then joins him. So, yeah, there are some great gags. But then there are long dry stretches. And, as I said, the film is very shallow. It's content to be just a spoof, so, in the end, it's not all that memorable. But it's well worth watching if you're looking for some quick, easy laughs.",9,3,7,23 December 2007
We're the Millers," Starts off hilariously, but then kind of fades
","A disappointment. It's not that I went into it thinking it was going to be great or anything. I was only hoping for a decent comedy with a few laughs. It's that it starts off so great but then kind of fades into nothingness over the course of its runtime. Jason Sudeikis plays a pot dealer who, after losing his stash to muggers, is forced to travel to Mexico by his employer (Ed Helms) to pick up 'a smidge' of marijuana for him. Stymied by the task, Sudeikis eventually comes up with a plan: recruit three misfits he knows to pretend to be his vacationing family, in the hopes that the border patrol will overlook it. There's his nerdy next door neighbor (Will Poulter, who several years ago starred in the excellent film Son of Rambow), a runaway teen girl (Emma Roberts) and a stripper (Jennifer Aniston). The four misfits bond and become more and more family-like. Problem is, all the best jokes occur in the first half hour. It really runs out of steam. After escaping Mexico, the Millers accidentally pair up with a DEA agent (Nick Offerman) and his family (Kathryn Hahn plays his wife). I love Offerman and Hahn, but the film never knows what to do with them (Offerman does get a couple of awesome moments). The film also never really knows what to do with Aniston or Roberts (there's a decent subplot near the end where Roberts falls for a carny and her 'parents' try to stop her). Sudeikis starts off really well, but as the film runs out of steam he seems to be working overtime to get it back on track. Helms is probably the most consistent of the actors. He's great in all his scenes. This film isn't too bad a way to waste time, but I wish it were better.",6,0,1,31 December 2013
Monsters vs. Aliens," Kind of fun, but the gags rarely work
","Pretty much par for the course for Dreamworks' animated features. It ain't bad, necessarily, but it's little more than a diversion. I'd rank this one relatively low among their films, though. Actually, when it's doing action and sci-fi stuff, it's pretty fun. I especially loved the whole sequence where the giant alien robot chased the giant girl (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) through San Fransisco. The big problem with this movie is that it is almost never funny. It tries really hard - Seth Rogen in particular tries really hard as a semi-sentient blob of goo - but all the jokes land with a thud. I should say I kind of liked Stephen Colbert, as well, as the president. The animation is quite good, though nowhere near as good as anything Pixar has produced. The movie originally played in 3D in most theaters, and it opens with the most clichéd 3D image imaginable: a ball and paddle game. I think it might have been a joke, but it's a good example of how flat all the jokes fall here.",6,0,0,28 December 2009
Dreamgirls," The year's big 'if'
","It's a crowd-pleaser all right, and I usually object to those. But I have to say, this member of the crowd was rather pleased with the film. It's nothing deep, I'll say right off the bat. It's no cinematic masterpiece that will be a beacon for films to come. What it is, however, is an absolute ball. It's the only film I think I've ever seen that really captures the experience of seeing a great musical in the theater. It's fun, it's rousing, and it just made me feel good. The music is outstanding and surprisingly comes off as stuff that might really have been recorded during the eras depicted, with maybe just the right tinge of Broadway to them. The vocal performances are just outstanding. Of course by now everyone knows the standout is Jennifer Hudson, who will be unstoppable at the Oscars this year. Her acting is quite good, but she'll win it for the singing. I would also be perfectly happy to see Eddie Murphy take home a statuette. He's excellent in both comedic and dramatic moments. Much of the rest of the cast is good, too, including Beyoncé Knowles and Anika Noni Rose. The story is of course based on that of the Supremes, and in that way, I felt a little Susan Alexander Kane / Marion Davies situation going on with Deena Jones / Diana Ross. While the Dreams are supposed to be only like the Supremes, the film kind of does imply that Ross was not an extremely talented singer, which is of course patently false. Anyway, small quibble. No, Dreamgirls is no masterpiece, but I like it about as much as I liked Chicago, probably a tad more, and I wouldn't be too ticked off if the Academy went with it for Best Picture. I do prefer it slightly to The Departed. I just don't think Scorsese's fourth best movie about organized crime should be crowned. Definitely recommended, as long as you know what you're getting into.",8,58,116,1 January 2007
Being John Malkovich," The screenplay is a little screwy...
","And I don't mean that the movie is weird. I like that. Everyone should appreciate the freshness of this movie. What I mean is that the screenplay is a little uneven. When I first saw this film (on opening day, luckily), I liked it a lot but felt that there was a major problem. It took me months to figure out why I felt this way, but I did finally figure it out, and I have confirmed it on subsequent viewings. The first half hour or so, all the screen time before the portal is found, contains an entirely different humor than the rest of the picture. And this humor is mostly childish and unfunny. The secretary and the joke about her being an expert on speaking disabilities was very unfunny. I feel embarrassed when I watch it it's so bad. The video about why the 7 1/2 floor exists is also extremely unfunny, as well as the 7 1/2 floor itself. I didn't find any of these things funny, and there were even more than that. I did like the puppet show that Craig gave on the street corner, I did like Dr. Lester's sexual rantings (although dirty old men jokes are really commonplace), and I laughed a lot when Craig was guessing Maxine's name.
Fortunately, when the portal is found, the childish humor pretty much completely vanishes. The rest of this movie is very intelligent. Every joke hits. There are no misses like there are in the first half hour.But what is really special about this film is how smoothly it becomes a compelling drama and character study. It is so well filmed. Watch how the Craig, Lottie, and Maxine dolls are used all through the film. I really felt it when Maxine was covering up the Lottie puppet. I actually teared up during the chase through Malkovich's subconscious, which I think is probably the single best scene that appeared in a film in 1999. And I also wept at the very, very, very beautiful ending. The second time I saw this in a theater, they cut out the beginning of the credit sequence where Emily was swimming, and I absolutely screamed, telling everyone in the theater about the sham that had been pulled. And I found the ending even more startling on the third viewing because I hadn't realized what actually happened to Craig at the end on my first and second viewings. I love this movie, so I am very hurt by the childish humor in the first half hour. It does embarrass me. It detracts from the whole film. Overall, I have to give it a 9/10.",9,5,9,15 June 2000
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Has heart, but it's only moderately funny
","Reminds me of the Farrelly Brothers' last few films. It's a comedy that wants to come off as really touching and thoughtful, one that doesn't want to use its pathetic characters for laughs, but then forgets to be especially funny otherwise. The 40 Year-Old Virgin is funny often enough to make it worth seeing, but the laughs are rarely belly laughs. I just never felt satisfied even after its best jokes. It seemed to be pulling some major punches. Scenes go on for a long time without payoff, and other scenes that seem to have golden setups get cut way too short. For example, in one sequence the title character's friends set him up with a prostitute. It becomes obvious from the outset that it's a man, but as soon as that's established, the movie cuts to the next scene. We don't see the virgin try to get out of the situation. We don't see the hooker try to do anything. There's a lot of potential for great comedy there; it doesn't have to be that dirty, either, to be funny. God knows we don't need a second Deuce Bigalow movie in the theaters this weekend. Steve Carell is very good, and all the characters are quite well fleshed out. I wish they would have done maybe a little more with Catherine Keener. She seems like she might be more interesting if we knew more about her. The movie's worth seeing, but wait for video.",7,4,14,22 August 2005
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Hard to dislike, but thoroughly mediocre
","While it has an interesting story and a very good performance by George Clooney in it (every bit as good as his Oscar nominated performance in Up in the Air), The Men Who Stare at Goats is imminently forgettable. And that's just disappointing in itself. Ewan MacGregor stars as a reporter who meets up with Clooney, a supposed psychic who has worked for the Army in the past. He was part of a hippie/supernatural-inspired Army research project, the New Earth Army, and is now in Iraq (the year is 2003) on a secret mission. The film has many flashbacks to the 1980s, during the New Earth Army days. Jeff Bridges was their leader. Stephen Lange is a General who is fascinated with the supernatural and gets Bridges his funding. Kevin Spacey plays Clooney's main rival. Somehow, with this pretty darn interesting material, Grant Heslov makes absolutely nothing of it. It's never bad, per se, but it just sits there not doing much. Ewan MacGregor does drag the film down a little. He seems cast just because the constant references to Jedi (the members of the New Earth Army call themselves Jedi). It's a joke Heslov never makes work. MacGregor has a terrible time perfecting an American accent. I rarely notice when foreigners feign American accents, but MacGregor seems like he's about to have an aneurysm much of the time.",6,1,3,2 May 2010
Spider-Man," Rare summer blockbuster that not only lives up to expectations but surpasses them
","Frankly, a serious, realistic film version of Spider-Man is an impossibility. How, pray tell, does one make a movie with a character like The Green Goblin or Dr. Octopus without making the audience laugh? That's why Sam Raimi was the absolute perfect director for the Spider-Man movie. He's got the most uncanny ability to entertain the heck out of the audience while they are laughing at how tremendously silly the whole thing is. This comes from the Evil Dead section of his career.Now, from the more recent side of his career, like The Gift and A Simple Plan, Raimi brings the ability to people Spider-Man with good characters. Some of them are straight from the comic book, sure. Rosemary Harris' Aunt May is a perfect version of that character. And Willem Defoe's Osbourne/Green Goblin. He's so cartoonish, well, let me reserve a special place later on to talk about Defoe's performance.Now, Peter Parker, Mary Jane, and Harry Osbourne (Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco respectively) are amazingly well realized. I did the same double take that everyone else did when they heard that Tobey Maguire was cast as Spiderman. Huh? That kid from The Ice Storm? Well, he's been very good in several movies (he was also poorly cast in a few movies, too, especially The Cider House Rules), and Raimi obviously cast him because of his acting skills. He could have went for the kid from Dawson's Creek or something, but he was right to get someone who could actually act. Kirsten Dunst may be the most underrated actress out there right now. She's been in some for-the-money projects, surely, and this is another one that'll pay her big. But in the meantime she lands some great roles, things like The Virgin Suicides and Crazy/Beautiful. Even the weak stuff she improves simply by her presence. Spider-Man isn't one of her best performances, but she's good. I like the early stuff, her problems with her terrible parents. It's actually kind of disappointing that they leave that character baggage almost completely behind Mary Jane after they graduate and move into the city. She is more or less relegated into the role of damsel in distress at that point. James Franco, who plays Harry Osbourne, is exceptional. I believe that his character becomes a super villain in the comic book, and that suggestion is left with us at the end of this film. He projects a lot of personality, more than his character actually has in the script.Now for Willem Defoe. No, he's not bad. Exactly the opposite. This is where the film goes way over-the-top, deliciously so. The Green Goblin is a great villain. He's nearly at the same level as Jack Nicholson's The Joker. Willem Defoe has a ton of great scenes, both as Osbourne and as The Green Goblin. I love the seen where he has a conversation with his evil mirror reflection. Critics are kind of complaining about Defoe's performance, but I think it's perfect for the film.Another great comic-book performance comes from J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, the newspaper publisher with whom Peter Parker sells his Spider-Man photographs. His scenes are the best in the film. Hope he has even more next time!My only real complaints about the film are the generous steals from the first Tim Burton Batman film (the balloon parade attack) and The Matrix (the fire sequence). There are so many inventive sequences that it's unfortunate that they couldn't come up with two more original ones.Spider-Man, despite its small flaws, is the perfect example of summer entertainment. I am seriously considering seeing it again in the theater, something I never do for this kind of film. It's probably the only time that I walked out of the theater wondering why the sequel was taking so long to make!Word to Raimi fans: both Bruce Campbell and Ted Raimi. They both have hilarious cameos.",8,1,2,5 May 2002
The Machinist," If you can't figure out the mystery before it's revealed, you might think it's a good movie
","Christian Bale stars as an insomniac factory worker who begins to lose his sanity. This is the kind of movie that has a mysterious character, unknown and unseen by all except the protagonist, pop up. We know pretty much instantly that this mystery person doesn't exist, and, given the hundred other movies of the last decade where it has happened, we assume that it's a manifestation of the protagonist's psyche. In The Machinist, it's particularly easy to guess it all, because we're told from the outset that Bale hasn't slept for a whole year. We know he's probably hallucinating, so we know that everything we see him experience is possibly not real. This is also the kind of film where images and actions are repeated, so we can figure that these things are involved in some kind of major event that happened before the story started (perhaps the time Bale stopped sleeping, eh?). If we can stick it out to the end, we'll know the whole story. Brad Anderson's direction is pretty good, I'll admit, but we've seen The Machinist a hundred times since the beginning of this decade. If you've seen films like Memento, Mulholland Dr., Takashi Miike's Box, Fight Club, The Sixth Sense, Stay, or The Secret Window, you've already seen The Machinist.",6,2,6,9 September 2007
Ratatouille," Keep in mind - I liked this movie, but my criticisms are mostly negative because I expect more from Pixar
","Good, but not at the level that I expect from Pixar. It's always fun, but it's often in danger of feeling slight. Besides the awesome setpiece of Remy, the gourmand rat, entering Gusteau's kitchen for the first time and the wonderful climax, there is little that is memorable. The characters are also pretty generic, except for food critic Anton Ego, voiced by Peter O'Toole, and Colette, voiced by an unrecognizable Jeneane Gorofolo. Remy is dull, as are a lot of cartoon heroes (they're hardly ever the most memorable characters), and the other rats don't have enough screen time to make an impression. The villainous chef is a dull bad guy, and Luigi, the human who is helped by Remy, is never redeemed by the script. Even in the end, that character has taken advantage of Remy. He admits that to the other characters, but doesn't do much to make up for it. I would actually have ranked Disney's CGI film, Meet the Robinsons, above this, but the climax is so wonderful, and the aftermath so beautiful, that I ultimately felt very pleased, despite only being moderately so for the other 90 minutes.",8,2,8,8 July 2007
The Amazing Spider-Man," Unnecessary, though not necessarily bad
","A re-boot of a series that only started a decade ago, and ended just five years ago. As such, it feels unnecessary and probably a tad rushed. It has to go through all that origin story stuff again, and, in my opinion, that's almost always what kills comic book movies, especially ones where I'm already familiar with the origin story (Batman Begins, despite being very well liked, has never worked for me either for the very same reason). It also doesn't help that James Garfield, who has proved himself a really fine actor elsewhere, feels weak as Peter Parker. He just never seems like he could be a super hero. Tobey Maguire really surprised me as being capable in the role, but Garfield doesn't. The film does get better as it goes on, especially after the super-villain, the Lizard, is created (played by Rhys Ifans). Before the classic accident that turns him into the Lizard, Ifans is kind of dull, but the actual Lizard monster is truly an imposing villain and actually kind of frightening. The action sequences are pretty good, though both Spider-Man and the Lizard are CGI creation. It thus amounts to simply watching cartoons fight, but it's well done for what it is. Emma Stone has good presence as the girlfriend, Gwen Stacy. Dennis Leary plays her father. Martin Sheen and Sally Field are Peter's Uncle Ben and Aunt May. Sheen's good when he's around, but Field has no presence as Aunt May.",6,4,9,11 November 2012
Aliens," Probably the best action film ever made, and one of the best sci-fi films
","This is James Cameron's best film. He used to be an action auteur (but I think he threw that completely away with Titanic). Aliens is a masterpiece of thrills. The set is so claustrophobic, it makes me shiver just thinking about it. The reason that this movie becomes so great, though, is the mother/daughter relationship between Ripley and Newt. This is such a realistic relationship. And the actress who plays Newt was one great child actor, every bit as good as Haley Joel Osment from The Sixth Sense. Like I said in my review of Alien, Ripley is a great character played by Sigourney Weaver, a great actress. Her suffering becomes ours. Also, notice how every scene takes place from her point of view. In the special addition DVD, though, there is a scene added where we see the colony (actually, Newt's father) find the aliens. This is used to introduce the colony's situation and to introduce Newt, but it was an enormous mistake to reinsert this scene back into the film. It breaks the rhythym quite terribly. It is a particularly long and clunky scene in the first place. It was enough when Paul Reiser told us that there has been a colony on that asteroid for many years. The audience knows right away that something is going to happen there with the aliens which will make Ripley have to go there. Now, with this scene having been reinserted, when the soldiers enter the colony and find a single life-form moving around, we know it is Newt (since that first scene kept focusing in on her). There is no surprise as their used to be. It should have just been left as a supplemental scene. Bad, bad mistake. Of course, that scene could not ruin this great film. Only really perceptive people who have a huge understanding of the language of film will ever notice it. But those of you who read this review, pay attention to that scene. I give this film a 10/10 because originally Cameron was smart enough to take that scene out. He must have reinserted it after he made Titanic.",10,6,9,6 April 2000
The Fast and the Furious," A lot of fun (SLIGHT SPOILERS)
","The Fast and the Furious is not a great movie by any means, but it is very entertaining. It's definitely a turn-your-brain-off-for-two-hours flick, a nice popcorn flick. The plot is your basic undercover cop conflicted by his attachment to those he is infiltrating kind of thing. No real surprises here. The acting is quite good. I'm putting my money on Vin Diesel becoming the next Arnold Schwarzenegger. Michelle Rodriguez, who was just amazing in last year's Girlfight (she is why I saw this film), is extremely sexy in it. Oh yeah, she gives a good performance, too. I hope she gets some great roles after the success of this movie. The other performers are all relatively good. There aren't any weak spots. The action, which is why most will see The Fast and the Furious, is very good. Although one might wonder why it takes five minutes, even in slow motion, for cars that go 150+ MPH, to travel a quarter of a mile, it doesn't hurt the flick too much. I generally don't like car chase movies. The Mad Max films and this are probably the only exceptions. I was clenching my teeth during several action sequences. 7/10.",7,1,1,4 January 2002
Now You See Me," Dumb but fun
","Big, shiny and dumb. It's also moderately entertaining. Four great magicians are chosen by a mysterious benefactor to become the Four Horsemen. Their goal: to astonish with spectacular tricks and, Robin Hood-like, rip off the criminally rich. Their first big trick involves robbing a Parisian bank from a Las Vegas stage. This puts detectives Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent on their tails, along with famous magic debunker Morgan Freeman. Very little in this film makes much sense, and I think it makes zero sense after the huge twist it ends with. It moves along so fast it's hard to care too much. Director Leterrier is a very good action director, but this isn't really an action movie. The movie's best sequence, though, is an action sequence and involves Dave Franco, one of the Horsemen, using his magic to dodge and trick the cops who are after him. The Horsemen (besides Franco there are Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson and Isla Fisher) get very little characterization and they probably have less screen time than Ruffalo, Laurent or Freeman. Michael Caine also co-stars. There's a lot of talent here and it's all wasted. Still, not a bad time waster. I saw it because I thought the trailer for the sequel looked even better. I'm not convinced by the first installment, but if reviews are good enough I may partake. I'll probably do so on video at any rate.",7,0,0,29 May 2016
Tropic Thunder," They really need to cool down with movie trailers! Felt like I'd already seen the movie!
","Very amusing big budget comedy about a bunch of superstar actors who think they're making a movie when they're really lost in the jungle and being pursued by machine-gun wielding members of a drug cartel. Ben Stiller plays a huge action star trying to break into drama. Robert Downey Jr. plays a method actor who goes so deep into character that he doesn't break it until the DVD commentary. And Jack Black is a star of fart-themed movies who is addicted to heroin. I laughed a lot at Tropic Thunder, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd hoped I would. Part of it is that they've had so many previews and commercials for the movie, and they've been airing them since April or so, and I've pretty much seen the whole movie. But that might not really be the whole reason, because even the jokes that I hadn't seen - and there were plenty - weren't always making me laugh. And even when I was laughing, I never laughed big. And maybe it's because two other comedies released in the past month, Step Brothers and Pineapple Express, both made my sides split. Yes, even Step Brothers, as stupid as I will admit it was. While I would recommend those two even more, I would also say Tropic Thunder is well worth seeing.",7,1,5,18 August 2008
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," I loved it
","Witty, silly and tons of fun. Michael Cera plays a bass player for a rock band who falls for an ultra-cool alterna-chick, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who just moved to town. Unfortunately, her seven evil exes have formed a league to destroy any new love interest, and Cera finds himself in frequent Street Fighter-style combat against them. The movie is very heavily influenced by video games, and it appeals mostly to those of us who grew up on Nintendo. Even if you're not one of those people, the film really doesn't completely rely on these references to survive. Edgar Wright, the writer/director of two of the funniest movies of the last decade, Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, is a great comedic director, and the film is full of great comedic timing and detail. The movie is also blessed with a fantastic cast, almost overstuffed with great performances, really. There are so many great characters in the film, some of them get short shrift. My favorite character was the girl whom Scott dumps before moving on to Ramona, Knives Chau (Ellen Wong), a Chinese, Catholic high schooler who obsesses over him for the rest of the movie. I also loved the sarcastic drummer from Scott's band, played by Alison Pill. Last year's Oscar nominee Anna Kendrick also co-stars in a far too small roll as Scott's younger sister.",10,8,29,15 August 2010
Enchanted," Slight but quite amusing
","Not a great movie, but a delightful one. It's nice to see Disney playing with their own formula, even if it is with kids' gloves. So many other films and TV series have ripped it apart quite meanly, but few have done it as well and as poignantly. Enchanted still wants to rely in the happily-ever-after thing in the end, but at least they acknowledge the real world here. The lead actor plays a divorce attorney, for instance. He's a single father, and for the longest time I was expecting the story of how he became a widower, but then it's revealed that his wife left him. And it's nice to see the traditional princess and damsel in distress, played by Amy Adams, become the hero during the climax. Adams is the main reason to watch. She's such a charmer. James Marsden is also quite funny as the prince who has come to rescue her, and Timothy Spall has a nice, hammy role similar to the one he also played in Sweeney Todd last year. And it's nice to see Susan Sarandon turn into a dragon. It's about time she revealed her true form to the world.",7,1,4,23 March 2008
Inside Out," Tremendous
","Amazingly complex animated film that builds the inside of an 11 year-old girl's mind as a fantastical world of wonder. Five basic emotions, Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust, live inside the mind of Riley and are in control of her attitude and memories. Joy (Amy Poehler) has done a good job of leading the emotions up to this point, but when Riley's parents drag her to San Francisco for her father's job, Sadness (Phyllis Smith) becomes more powerful, much to Joy's chagrin. The metaphors Pete Docter and Ronaldo Del Carmen have created in this girl's mind are insanely clever. Very quickly you get a bit ahead of the film, understanding Riley's emotional responses and the inner workings of her mind before we see her, in real life, react. It actually gets so abstract at times I think I wouldn't recommend the film for younger children - it probably is meant more for children closer to Riley's age, and their parents (and adults in general) will probably get more out of it than any child will. There's a bit of a slapstick element, and, honestly, sometimes it feels a bit out of place. As one might expect, the animation is wonderful. The fantastical world is beautiful, but for me it was the characters who really stood out. Joy in particular is one of Pixar's all-time greatest characters, and she's perfectly performed by Poehler. This is definitely one of Pixar's best movies.",9,26,63,21 June 2015
Quantum of Solace," Poor
","The second movie of the new Bond franchise, following the very successful Casino Royale. It's pretty clear that I'm not at all a Bond fan. I kind of like the modern Bonds, the Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig ones, as mediocre action movies. That's all I see them as. I see the old ones as mildly amusing camp at best, completely inept Hitchcock rip-offs at worst. Casino Royale was a slightly above mediocre action movie. Quantum of Solace, on the other hand, is just a plain bad one. It's ineptly directed by a man who's never been close to an action picture before, and its editing is some of the worst I've ever seen. For the life of me, I could barely ever tell what was going on in the action sequences. I don't know if I like Craig as Bond, even in the last one. He's too brutish and nasty. He lacks the suaveness that is supposed to define Bond. There are a couple of things I did like about Quantum of Solace: 1) The theme song is the best one since GoldenEye. I'm a White Stripes fan, and very much liked Jack White's song. Alicia Keys' presence was unnecessary, however. 2) I like the Bond girl, Olga Kurylenko. Not only is she very hot, but I like that the women of the last two Bond movies had a little more substance than the objectified Bond girls of the past. 3) The bad guy, played by Mathieu Amalric: I never connected to his character in The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, because he struck me as a sniveling scumbag. In Quantum of Solace, he plays a sniveling scumbag, so he fits the role perfectly.",5,3,7,16 November 2008
Gone with the Wind," Yuck
","Probably the most overblown, overrated classical film there is, GWTW fails in almost every account, acting being the biggest. The screenplay is poor in every respect. There are about three scenes that work, all in the first half (all the ones that are particularly famous), but the second half is nothing but dreck. Scarlette O'Hara is perhaps the most selfish, most annoying character ever committed to celluloid, and Rhett Butler is not much better. I sympathized with him, though, because his rudeness came about when having to deal with HER. And about the racism: you may attribute the casual racism to the era in which GWTW was made, but I feel this is unfair. Sure, people were racist at the time, in the North and in the South, but few in the 1930s would have argued against emancipation. This film is NOT just trying to depict how things were in the 1860s, but is actually arguing for slavery. And against the 15th amendment (? maybe 14th; blacks' right to vote, anyways). There is a scene where carpetbaggers are shown as cowardly, evil people as they try to convince black men to vote. How evil this movie is.For comparison, read the novels of William Faulkner. It would be wrong to deny that he was racist, but, unlike GWTW, he writes about similar events with intelligence. In his novel The Unvanquished, there is a scene that is cognate to the carpetbaggers' trying to get the black men to vote. He does not, however, depict the carpetbaggers as caricatures, but depicts the pathos of the situation.So the question arises: why does this Margaret Mitchell crap still exist when we as Americans have William Faulkner's insightful novels? It's just the stupidity of this country, I guess.",5,8,25,13 July 2001
The Butterfly Effect," The critics really dropped the ball and turned a cold shoulder on a fine film here
","(note: this is a review of the director's cut of the film, which has a completely different ending than the theatrical release)The Butterfly Effect was either ignored or ridiculed by most major critics. Most minor ones, too. In reality, while it has its flaws, and some rather big ones, too, it is one of the best films to be released so far in 2004. It is already being rediscovered by audiences, and I think it will find a home amongst the lovers of gimmick films such as Memento and Donnie Darko. I am a fan of all three of these films, and it's not because they're based on clever gimmicks. Plenty of films have clever gimmicks and completely fail. I like these three particular films because they're intelligent and have strong stories that move them beyond their central gimmicks. The Butterfly Effect is about a young man (Ashton Kutcher) who experienced severe blackouts during traumatic moments when he was a child. As an adult, he discovers that he can travel back to these forgotten events and change their outcome. Unfortunately, every time he changes things for what should be the better, some individual always gets the shaft. Besides himself, the major players in the story are his mother (Melora Walters), his girlfriend, Kayleigh, her brother, Tommy, and their friend, Lenny. The story is gripping. It's hard not to imagine situations in your own life that you'd want to change, so the appeal is universal. As Kutcher changes time and time again, he starts to lose grip of reality. His desperation grows deeper each time he changes the past. The movie does lose its footing as it nears the finish. One can imagine how hard it must be to end a story like this. It looked as if they were going to go with the 'It's all just a dream' ending, which really p***ed me off. Then they cheated their gimmick a little, which, as annoying as that was, it wasn't as annoying as the previous option. Then came kind of an ugly ending which really angered me, and which upsets a lot of what happened in the film in the first place. After a bit of time thinking it over, though, it didn't seem quite as bad as it first did. There are still some major holes this way around, but it made sense thematically. As for the technical feats, The Butterfly Effect is very well done. The writers/directors, Bress and Gruber, may not get everything right, but they have delivered an ambitious and thoughtful film. Better yet, they delivered it right to a multiplex audience who doubtless went in expecting escapism. What they'll get is something ten times more challenging than anything else they'll see this year. The look of it is good, it's well edited, and there's really good use of music and sound. The final question has to be this: so, can Ashton Kutcher deliver a dramatic performance? The answer is yes, but not an unqualified yes. Truthfully, the protagonist of the story could have been improved. He's more of cypher than anything, and a lot of the emotional value comes from the side characters whose lives he effects. Kutcher isn't asked to do too much. Still, he holds his own in plenty of scenes. He was quite good, for instance, in the sequence where he goes to prison. I wonder if all the pans this film received came because it was a drama starring that goofball from Dude, Where's My Car? I think, in the long run, if Kutcher wants to become a dramatic actor, he could pull it off. He's a handsome guy with a lot of charm. 9/10.",9,134,182,6 July 2004
No Country for Old Men," Almost a horror movie at times, this is one fantastic thriller and one of the Coens' best
","I'm not sure one viewing can do this film justice. It leaves a lot to think about, and I spent a good portion of my Sunday reading other people's views to see if I can come to some sort of conclusion about it. But I can't yet. Well, I can come to the conclusion, in any case, that this is a fantastic movie. There's no doubt about that. The Coens go back to their darker, noir-inspired sides, making the barren Texas landscape feel as cold as the Minnesota winter. The central story has a Vietnam veteran, played by Josh Brolin, finding a bundle of cash on the scene of a drug deal gone wrong. Meanwhile, a methodical killer by the name of Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) hunts him down. On the sidelines is an aging sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) who works something like a Greek chorus, commenting on the main action but never able to have any effect on it. Looked at as a simple piece of film-making, No Country is brilliant. The Coens create a couple of the best setpieces they've ever done. They crank the tension up so high that I  along with the entire audience  was holding my breath. This is the closest thing the Coens have ever made to a horror movie, too. At times, it reminded me of a slasher, where we're waiting to see Chigurh dispose of his next victim in a gruesome way. But unlike your common director of a slasher movie, the Coens know how to make movies. It's not enjoyable when someone gets killed here. It feels all too realm and frankly it was scaring the hell out of me at times. Bardem plays the most memorable movie monster of the current decade. The character even sees himself as a monster, of sorts, as a hand of fate. In that way, Chigurh reminds me of another movie character, Ryunosuke Tsukue, Tatsuya Nakadai's character in Kihachi Okamoto's Sword of Doom. The two films share some similarities (surely unintentionally), for example the almost Brechtian dodge of a conventional climax that forces us to reconsider what  and who  the films are actually about. I think one big question that I've come up with is whether the film sees Chigurh as a force of nature, or whether it is just Chigurh seeing himself that way, and that he is as much subject to the forces of nature and fate as anyone else in the story. No Country started to lose me a little when it went after some big themes at the end. I feel like I didn't absorb everything there was, and maybe I just didn't 'get' what the authors (the Coens and Cormac McCarthy, with whose work I'm entirely unfamiliar outside of this film) were going for. But I also have a sneaking suspicion that the big themes get a little lost, that the Coens don't accomplish everything they set out to do. But I am eager to see this again  and again  to see if I can work it all out.",10,6,22,11 November 2007
District 9," Smart, exciting sci-fi from South Africa
","Newcomer Neill Blomkamp shows up every American sci-fi blockbuster of the last decade. It's not an extremely complex film, but it is coherent, has a decent amount of intelligence, a good idea behind it and fairly interesting characters. That's all you really need, isn't it? The premise: 20 years ago, a gigantic alien ship stalled over the city of Johannesburg, South Africa. Inside it were about a million aliens, starving to death and unable to fix the ship. They were brought down and allowed to live in the slums of the city. The human inhabitants dislike them, and want them to be removed from their society. The story: Sharlto Copley plays a bureaucrat in charge of moving the population of aliens, known as Prawns, into a refugee camp some distance from the city. Obviously, with a population now numbering nearly one and a half million, these creatures aren't easily moved. Some of them even have some tricks up their sleeves. The story obviously has parallels to South Africa's own apartheid situation, which gives the movie a little bit of heft. I also thought Copley's character was quite daring, because he's the protagonist but he's really quite an unlikeable little snot for most of the movie (it also supplies a more identifiable alien character, named Christopher Johnson). The little flack the film has gotten from critics involves its basically turning into an action flick in the second half (the first half is actually done in documentary form, which works for the most part). While I admit it's a little more predictable in its second half, I don't see why we should complain that it's an action movie when it's a good action movie. We actually care when the characters are in danger. With all the garbage that has been released in the summer of '09, a good action movie is more than welcome. One complaint I would make, probably the thing that holds the film back from being a masterpiece, is the completely bland villains, led by a dull corporate CEO and a sadistic military leader.",9,3,8,16 August 2009
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," One of the best so far this decade
","This almost defines the oft-used term 'elegiac Western'. It has some of the well-worn themes of Westerns, such as the creation of Western myth vs. the cold, harsh realities. But for some reason, it never feels like anything else I've ever seen. It has a style more reminiscent of Michelangelo Antonioni than any of the great Western filmmakers. It's slow and likes to surround its characters with enormous landscapes that almost swallow them whole. But it's also not averse to close-ups. Director Dominik, who has only made one other film, Chopper, and it's been seven years since then, loves to concentrate on facial expressions, as well as body language (don't know if I've ever seen a film with this level of attention to body language, or maybe it's just not something to which I've ever been lead to pay much attention). The cast is uniformly brilliant. Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck are the titular leads, and neither has done as well. Affleck is a revelation. The supporting cast includes Sam Rockwell, Mary-Louise Parker, Jeremy Renner, Garrett Dillahunt and Paul Schneider. Andrew Dominik is the star, though. There have been plenty of successful Westerns over the past couple of decades, but I'd be hard-pressed to name a single one out that so beautifully and completely re-invents the genre. 3:10 to Yuma may well be the big money-making Western of the year, but I think history will recall it as being the year that The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford was released. It is the best film of the year so far, and will be hard to top.",10,159,229,16 October 2007
Batman Begins," Mediocrity
","A nice effort, I suppose, but a failure nonetheless. I actually prefer the first three installments of the 1980s & 1990s Batman franchise, though none of them are great movies, either. Tim Burton  and even Joel Schumacher  brought at least some vision into their Batman worlds. Nolan attempts to do this realistically  that was the original idea, anyway  but he is bogged down by screen writing and action movie clichés. There weren't half as many explosions in all four of the 90s Batman films combined. Batman Begins does little to deepen the story, as some critics have claimed. The backstory was told perfectly, and with great economy, in 1989's Batman. There was no emotion lost. Nolan takes nearly an hour to tell it, and he doesn't make it any more interesting. They didn't find a better actor to play Batman. Christian Bale is as dull as Keaton, Kilmer, and Clooney. The villains are uninteresting. Ra's Al Ghul (which is mispronounced throughout the film) has always been my least favorite of the Batman villains. Dr. Jonathan Crane, aka 'the Scarecrow' is wonderfully played by Cillian Murphy when he's out of his mask, but he is supremely uninteresting when he's in it (doesn't help that Nolan resorts to stupid distorted images and noise pollution whenever he puts the mask on). Katie Holmes is a wonderful actress in small projects, but, like Natalie Portman, she doesn't translate well to blockbusters. Plus, Tom Cruise just ruined her for me. Gary Oldman and Tom Wilkinson are horribly miscast (Wilkinson as a mob boss?). They actually might have just switched roles and it would have been better. The only things the film gets excessively right are Alfred and Lucius Fox, played by Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman. But, really, while these two consummate actors bring an air of class to this kiddy pool, they out-act both the hero and the villains to such an extent that it warps the movie. I really should not desire more scenes with the butler. I should add Liam Neeson to that, as well. He's very good, and perfectly cast. Batman Begins is often a good actioner, but it should have been much better.",5,9,23,16 June 2005
Wreck-It Ralph," Tremendous
","The best American animated film of 2012, I think it's safe to say. Wreck-It Ralph (John C. Reilly) plays a video-game villain, a monstrous man who smashes a high-rise apartment every day while Fix-It Felix Jr. (Jack McBrayer), the hero, combats him and eventually gets him thrown off the building into a pile of mud. In the game's universe, this is just everyone's job. Ralph is sick of being the bad guy, though, and wants to win acceptance from the people who live in the apartment. The video game characters can leave their consoles and visit the other games, and Ralph decides to become a hero by entering a war game. Unfortunately, the havoc he wreaks there gets him thrown into another game where he wreaks even more havoc. This film is insanely clever, creating several different worlds with their own flavor. It's also just great at setting up plot points and twists without ever showing you its hand. Small bits that seem like only errant gags come back up later in surprising and brilliant ways. The characters are as well constructed as the plot. The two other most important characters are voiced by Jane Lynch and Sarah Silverman, as a sci-fi warrior and a pixie racer respectively. Silverman's character in particular is so wonderful, both adorable and annoying. Her character's relationship with Ralph becomes the emotional center of the film, and it packs almost as much of a wallop as Pixar's best works. The film is very much at Pixar's level throughout. It's really one of Disney's best movies, period. Huge congrats to Rich Moore, who follows in fellow-Simpsons veteran Brad Bird's footsteps in delivering a hugely satisfying feature film. Hopefully he'll give us another one really soon.",9,4,7,4 November 2012
To Rome With Love," Bland
","One of Woody's worst, probably my second least favorite after September (though I'll admit I haven't seen a lot of his films from the past 20 years). It's just so damned bland. Several plot lines, none of them interesting, play out with a mostly unexplored Roman backdrop (despite appearances by a few tourist attraction, this could have taken place anywhere in the world). The most notable one probably concerns Jesse Eisenberg, his girlfriend Greta Gerwig and her sexy best friend Ellen Page, with Alec Baldwin commenting upon them like a fly on the wall (we're never sure what exactly the situation is with Baldwin - either he's a Humphrey Bogart-like spirit like in Play It Again Sam or if he's the protagonist looking back on his own past). Another story concerns Alison Pill and her new beau introducing their parents to each other. Woody Allen annoys immensely as Pill's father (thankfully not her boyfriend) and Judy Davis is her mother. Allen, a former classical record producer, discovers that his daughter's soon-to-be father-in-law is a great opera singer, but only if he's in the shower. Thus plays out a hackneyed plot that I literally saw on the Pebbles and Bamm Bamm Show when I was a kid (I'm pretty sure). Two other, Italian language plot lines involve Roberto Begnini as a normal man who starts to get followed around by the paparazzi and a young couple who accidentally get split up and then end up with a prostitute and a movie actor. The Italian language plots I mostly lost track of after a while because I got bored of reading the subtitles for such an inconsequential endeavor.",5,2,5,3 February 2013
Bridesmaids," Hilarious
","Kristen Wiig stars and co-writes this Judd Apatow-produced film. It's billed as a raunchy, female-centric comedy, sort of a girly Hangover (which I'm sure was the original pitch), but it's far better than one might expect from that description. There's a real story here, with very well written characters. And, while it's absolutely hilarious when it wants to be, the pathos Wiig wants you to feel for the characters works. Wiig plays a hopeless woman in her mid-thirties. She has recently lost her bakery, as well as her boyfriend. The only attention she gets from men now is from a heartless prick (John Hamm) who just wants her as a friend with benefits. She's further hurt when her best friend (Maya Rudolph) announces that she's engaged.Wiig is chosen as the maid of honor, but she finds that she's in direct competition with Rudolph's other close friend, Rose Byrne, who is wealthy and can provide Rudolph with a lot of things that Wiig (who works as a saleswoman in a jewelry store) could not. The other bridesmaids are played by Wendi McLendon-Covey (of Reno 911), Ellie Kemper (of The Office) and Melissa McCarthy (of Mike and Molly). Their pre-wedding adventures generally end with Wiig screwing everything up. Chris O'Dowd (of The IT Crowd) has a nice role as a police officer who gets involved with Wiig. Yeah, it's a predictable romance, but O'Dowd's character is well written and he's very funny and charming. The romance actually develops quite naturally. Jill Clayburgh's final role is as Wiig's goofy but understanding mother. McCarthy, a very large and confident woman, is probably the breakout performer of the film. Everything she says and does in the movie is a riot.Wiig may be playing a character that she's played before on Saturday Night Live and in many of her film appearances, but it's still perfectly funny. And with the great writing backing the character, I'd say the performance is quite excellent. Byrne, who could easily have become a harpy, is given several small details that give us an insight into her character (most notably her two step-kids, who hate her). The film is almost cursed with too many great characters. McLendon-Covey and Kemper pretty much disappear at a certain point of the film, which is unfortunate. McLendon-Covey, in particular, is hilarious when describing her three foul-mouthed, chronically masturbating sons. There are also several non-speaking roles played by people comedy buffs will recognize, like Tim Heidecker (of Tim & Eric fame) as Rudolph's husband-to-be, Lynne Marie Stewart (who plays Charlie Day's mom on It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) as Rudolph's mother, and Nancy Carell (née Walls, Stephen Carell's wife and former Daily Show correspondent) and Melanie Hutsell (whom I haven't seen since the mid-90s when she was on SNL) play Byrne's and Wiig's tennis partners in one great sequence.About the only thing I didn't like in the film was John Hamm's role, which is far too two-dimensional compared to everyone else. He feels like he's in a much broader comedy (I think Wiig just wanted to share a goofy sex sequence with him; by the way, between this movie and MacGruber, Wiig is the queen of the awkward sex sequence). Director Paul Feig is best known as the creator of the classic dramedy series Freaks and Geeks, and he's directed for pretty much every great comedy series of the past decade and a half, including Arrested Development, 30 Rock, The Office and Parks & Recreation, so you should know you're in great hands there.",8,3,8,15 May 2011
Non-Stop," Silly as Hell, but quite entertaining
","Absolutely ludicrous Liam Neeson thriller (which is a genre now), but, frankly, it's just a lot of fun. I found myself smiling and giggling at the silliness of it all, but damned if I wasn't enjoying myself the whole time. Neeson plays an air marshal who receives a text shortly after his flight commences that, if a load of money isn't deposited into an untraceable bank account, a passenger will be killed every 20 minutes. The film is clever enough to make it impossible to guess - or, alternatively, you pretty much suspect everyone and hope like Hell they don't pull out the old Liam-Neeson-has-multiple-personalities-and-is-doing-it-himself twist. The film is hilariously convoluted with plenty of plot holes. When the villain is revealed, they say 'You'd never believe how easy it all was!' They are correct. I would never believe it. I still quite enjoyed watching it.",7,184,243,6 March 2014
Saving Private Ryan," Technically amazing, but the story is just okay
","Haven't seen this one since it played in theaters. I didn't think all that much of it then. It actually improved a bit on re-watch, though I still find that my problems with it back then have not at all disappeared. My main problem is (and was) that Spielberg really seems to think this film is some deep anti-war statement, some extremely important existential story, and it's just not. At heart, this is very much like the WWII classics The Story of G.I. Joe and Battleground (both directed by the great William A. Wellman), about a group of fairly stereotypical and not all that well defined soldiers who risk their lives for a greater purpose. Sure, they are constantly asking the question 'Is it worth it?', but Spielberg's (painfully corny) wraparound story, with Private Ryan visiting Arlington National Cemetery, answer that question with a resounding 'DUH!' Not to mention that the whole existential crisis (why should eight men be sent to die for one?) is a fabricated one, anyway, as it is, after all, fiction. And, during the film's release, we were told over and over again by everyone involved with the film and very gullible film critics that this was an anti-war movie (one of them who could see through that just saw fit to tell us how much more awesome Joe Dante's completely forgotten Small Soldiers was, so he seemed kind of like a crazy homeless person yelling at a wall). Yeah, it's so not that, either. The proof, twelve and a half years later, exists in the slew of WWII themed video games, all very clearly inspired by the film, that have ruled consoles in the past six or so years. I clearly remember Roger Ebert saying that this was the first film that did not make war seem fun, but damned if people aren't having a ton of fun shooting up Nazis on their TVs. I'd guess that Saving Private Ryan has done more to recruit new soldiers than any Army of One commercial ever has.So, yeah, it misses several of its main aims. However, while you can castigate Steven Spielberg for misunderstanding his context, you can't say a thing bad about his technical work on the film. Sure, the hand-held aesthetic that he uses in the battle sequences has inspired a lot of very dire copycats over the past twelve years (try not to laugh during the big battle at the start of Gladiator), but it was pretty brilliant at the time, and it really puts you right there. War might be fun, but it's also damn scary, and I found myself shaking with some tears in my eyes after the gigantic beach storming that opens the film (I try to forget the Arlington sequences exist) finally comes to an end. The slower, more personal moments aren't the best (partly due to the variable cast, which ranges from fantastic (Jeremy Davies) to acceptable (Tom Hanks) to terribly annoying (Edward Burns and Paul Giamatti)), but they're mostly fine, and always beautifully shot. I love some of the smaller moments of the movie, especially the slap that the little French girl gives her father when the G.I.s are able to hand her back to him, after the extraordinarily tense sniper sequence. All in all, while the film is kind of a mixed bag, I do think that the impressive moments far outweigh the overall ponderous nature of the movie.",8,2,3,6 December 2010
The Chorus," So Miramax
","This is the kind of stereotypically bland foreign film that the Academy loves to nominate in the Foreign Film category (I think they've gotten a bit better about it in the past several years). It's also a pretty stereotypical inspirational teacher story in the vein of Goodbye Mr. Chips. Gerard Jugnot stars as a kindly teacher who comes along to a boarding school for troubled boys. These kids are downright violent, so one would think this fat, balding, middle-aged man would have a lot of difficulty with them. He has a little, but they turn good pretty quick because he's nicer than the average teacher. Plus, he teaches them to sing, which is, you know, what the film is about. Jugnot is fine, and the children aren't bad actors. The music is really the saving grace. This is one of a small handful of foreign films that was also Oscar nominated outside of the Foreign Film category, this one in the Song category, Bruno Calais (who wrote one of my all-time favorite scores for the film Coraline) and director Christophe Barratier for the song 'Vois Sur Ton Chemin.'",6,0,0,1 March 2015
The Pianist," Good, but imdb voters are overrating it
","The Pianist is far from Roman Polanski's best film or his `most personal work,' as the back of the DVD case says. In fact, it's easily the least personal film I've seen from him; any director who has enough clout to secure the funding for the production could have made this film and had it turn out just as well. As a director, it is a small achievement. Likewise, the screenplay writes itself; in fact, it did write itself, as it's based on a true story. I must admit I have a bias against films dealing with WWII and especially the Jewish experience in Europe. Affecting the audience is as simple as snapping one's fingers. Or, more specifically, executing a Jew. Whenever the audience starts to get a little comfortable, all the filmmaker has to do is have a Nazi shoot a Jew in the head. It's all too easy. Any film with that subject matter is automatically deemed important in the minds of critics and audiences, which makes it difficult for anyone to propose any criticism against it. Truth be told, The Pianist is a very good film. It's well done, and, while I don't think it's Polanski's best work, he does a good job. But it's too easy, I think, to overpraise something like this. It was very entertaining that this movie caused so many upsets at the Oscars, but, after seeing the film, it doesn't surprise me. This is the kind of movie that impresses the Academy most, because it's easy. The three awards it won were not deserved, at least in my opinion. If I weren't so familiar with the Academy and their thought processes, it would really shock me that Polanski beat Scorsese, who made an original picture with verve and passion, and that Brody (I haven't mentioned him, and he is good) beat Daniel Day-Lewis, who, as I've just said above, creates a character that will live forever. As for the screenplay, Ronald Harwood (and/or Polanski) could have made the film much more than just one of ten thousand tales of survival. There are a lot of moments when more substance could have been found. I like how Szpilman has to constantly watch the action while locked up in a room, yearning to be able to do something about it, but always relegated to the spectator's role. They do do well when they introduce the character of the Nazi soldier trying to make good by helping Szpilman, but they don't do very much. Of course, I think part of the point is that this man appeared and disappeared without much pomp or circumstance. In fact, it would have been more powerful if they had never revealed that Szpilman discovered who this man was. Of course, that might have been disrespectful.I have now seen all five Best Picture nominees from last year, and I would rank them as follows: 1) The Hours; 2) Gangs of New York; 3) The Pianist; 4) Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers; 5) Chicago. That I rank the actual winner last shouldn't raise eyebrows, because, to tell you the truth, I don't rank The Pianist and The Two Towers that much higher. The first two were original, intelligent, and challenging. The last three were much simpler, and it's no big surprise that they are more beloved. 8/10.",8,4,8,6 July 2003
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Simply wonderful
","An extraordinary cinematic confection and probably Wes Anderson's greatest film. Ralph Fiennes plays the concierge at the Grand Budapest Hotel in the 1930s, which exists in a fictional European country in the Alpine range. He has a habit of keeping some of the old women who stay at the hotel company. When one (Tilda Swinton) leaves him the valuable painting Boy with Apple, Swinton's evil son (Adrien Brody) frames Fiennes for the murder. Fiennes' closest companion, the hotel lobby boy Zero (Tony Revolori), and his girlfriend (Saorsie Ronan) conspire to free Fiennes from prison and sell the painting for loads of money, hopefully enabling them to leave the country, which is being overtaken by fascists. The story isn't much more than fluff (though there is a nice tinge of poignancy), but it's enormously amusing fluff. The highly amusing trailer did give away many of the film's best gags, but this is a laugh a minute movie. The visuals are absolutely delightful. Sure, it's all nothing you haven't seen before from Anderson, but I found it his most perfect accomplishment. The film is loaded with great cameos and little roles (the woman behind me almost had an orgasm when Bill Murray appeared), but my favorite was Willem Dafoe as a toothless heavy.",10,50,83,23 March 2014
Seabiscuit," Best Picture my...eye
","Zetes' Dictionary defines `mediocrity' as the 2003 Best Picture nominee Seabiscuit, directed by Gary Ross. It's watchable, but it's a weak, uninteresting story that is poorly plotted and has a low success rate at tying said story into its historical context, as hard as it tries. I can take films about underdogs once in a while, providing that they're well done, but Seabiscuit wins, what, a quarter of the way through the movie and then its rich sponsor (played by Jeff Bridges) pesters the even richer owner of the Triple Crown winner War Admiral until he finally gives in, lest he be annoyed any further. The only actors who do anything nearing a decent job are Tobey Maguire as Seabiscuit's down-and-out jockey and William H. Macy, who plays a radio sports broadcaster. Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper, and that other uninteresting lady sleepwalk through the film. The film does boast some fine cinematography. 5/10.",5,1,3,2 February 2004
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Hilarious
","A brilliant horror comedy, probably the best of its genre since Shawn of the Dead. It'd probably surpass that film if it didn't stumble pretty badly in its final act, but it's still a ball. Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk (of Firefly) are two country boys visiting Tudyk's newly purchased cabin in the woods. Meanwhile, a group of preppy college students take them for psycho hillbillies. When Tucker and Dale save one of the students (Katrina Bowden of 30 Rock fame) from drowning, they take her back to their cabin to recover. Her boyfriend (Jesse Moss) and the other students think that she's been captured and attempt to save her, and generally behave as if they're in a slasher movie. And that's including the cast attrition, as every attempt to exterminate Tucker and Dale leads to the students' grisly demise, one after another. The concept only works to a certain point, and then it attempts to go for some further twists, and they don't generally work. But still, it's amusing even when it's not working, and absolutely hilarious when it is. Labine and Tudyk are both wonderful as the goofy, warm-hearted rednecks who cannot figure out for the life of them why these college students seem to be committing mass suicide around them. A true original, and one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in a while.",8,0,0,18 September 2011
Revolutionary Road," Well acted and made, but it's really just a turgid melodrama
","Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet star in this film about an unhappily married couple. When they met, they were idealistic youths, but when they arrive in the suburbs, he working in sales and she a housewife, life seems dreary. The film offers no new insights on marriage or life. It is set in the 1950s, so you might think it's like, say, Far from Heaven in that it attempts to exploit the inadequacies of an era so beloved by a certain group of our society. But, no, Revolutionary Road doesn't make much of its '50s setting. I think it wants to be more universally about marriage. It's set in the '50s, I think, so there's a better reason these two people who just plain dislike each other have to stay together. So, taking place in the 1950s actually dates the problems that these couple are having for the most part. The story just doesn't feel relevant to a modern audience. Or me, at least. The film isn't that bad in the end. The acting is quite good, especially from Kate Winslet. Though I am a big fan of Michael Shannon, I found his two scenes in the movie very poorly written, mostly concerning his character, who comes off as a mere plot tool rather than a real person. The film is very gorgeous to look at, thanks to Roger Deakins, and I liked Thomas Newton's score (he provided an even better one for Wall-E earlier in 2008).",7,2,7,11 January 2009
Foxcatcher," Exceptional
","Exceptional fact-based drama by workmanlike Bennett Miller, who directed Capote and Moneyball previously. Concerning the murder of a wrestling coach by millionaire heir John du Pont, the film examines what led to the tragedy. The major theme here is wealth and class in America, and it's one of the best films about that that has ever been made. The three major characters, du Pont and two brothers who both won Olympic gold medals, Mark and David Schultz, are beautifully written and plaid by Steve Carell, Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo respectively. Carell is a product of pure, American royalty, but having grown up relatively isolated from actual society, he's a giant weirdo. Tatum, the younger brother, lives only for wrestling and doesn't have much besides his older brother outside of that. When du Pont invites him to wrestle under his tutelage, he jumps at the opportunity. Ruffalo is content in his life with his loving family and at first refuses to join the team, though du Pont is very insistent. Of course, he can buy anything, and eventually does, spending an undisclosed amount of money to bring Ruffalo in. The action upsets Tatum, and the whole situation starts to go to Hell. The film is very cold, and quite slow moving, but I was deeply interested throughout. One of the films of the year, no doubt.",9,6,15,17 December 2014
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," I laughed more than anything else. SPOILERS
","Most people thought this was the biggest cinematic disappointment that they had ever seen, that is, until Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace was released two summers afterwards. I write this right after having come home from the third installment, Jurassic Park III, and I can safely say that JPII is the worst of the first 3 (apparently they're going to make one more, at least). Still, I didn't despise it as much as the majority of people.
The Lost World: Jurassic Park is the king of unintentional comedy. I've seen honest-to-God Godzilla movies that were less corny than this film. I had sat through the first half-hour, 45 minutes getting more and more irritated, but then came the scene where the trailer was dangling from a cliff. The characters are all hanging onto a rope on the inside of it, and, when it falls, everyone miraculously is able to hang onto the rope and keep it steady so that, say, a door didn't knock them off. My friend sitting next to me shouted 'Bull Sh*t!' I laughed. After that, it all became a laugh-fest. Whether it was Peter Stormare being devoured by tiny dinos or a little black girl (from the where-the-heck-did-you-come-from files) spinning around a randomly placed bar and kicking a raptor in the head (Jeff Goldblum's immortal unintentionally funny line: 'So you failed the gymnastics test, huh?'), I was almost on the floor at times. The best scenes result when, King Kong-style, the characters idiotically haul the T-Rex back to San Francisco, where she can munch on dogs and Japanese people (I've heard a rumor that the Japanese fellow it devours says: 'Why does this always happen to me?' in Japanese, although that sounds like a tall tale to me).
Yes, this is a terrible movie, but it is one that contains as many laughs as 90% of the comedy being released nowadays. 6/10. Heck, if it weren't for the fun-killing acting of Jeff Goldblum and Julianne Moore (easily the lowest point in her otherwise shining career), I would recommend this movie.",6,0,3,28 July 2001
It Follows," The hype is ridiculous, but this is a pretty good horror film
","Wow! I've never quite heard such angry grumbling over a movie when the lights came up before. The word 'horrible' was being thrown around generously, so much so that the teenage girl waiting to clean up the theater afterword commented on how angry everyone was. No, I'm not quite with these people (the theater was loaded at 11 AM, for the record), but this was a major disappointment. Much like the desperately overrated The Babadook, this is a somewhat clever horror movie that sort of bucks mainstream horror conventions. Just because it's better than most horror movies (and, believe me, I had to sit through half an hour of terrible-looking horror previews to see this movie - if you want a good laugh look up Unfriended on Youtube) doesn't make it anything fantastic.Maika Monroe (pretty but thankfully not boringly pretty like the protagonists in most horror movies) sleeps with her new boyfriend for the first time, and is in for a rude awakening. He knocks her out and ties her to a wheelchair. When she wakes up, he explains that some mysterious, murderous entity, in the guise of a random person, will follow her until it is able to kill her. She is advised to find someone quick and pass on the curse, although, if the next person is killed, it will come after her again. Monroe, her sister and their friends attempt to run away from the thing, but escape proves impossible.There is definitely some cleverness in the filmmaking. I love the way Mitchell makes you scan every frame of the film to search for the next follower. The film is never that scary, but it does raise some nice tension. There are some big flaws, though. The monster, when it appears, is usually pale with sunken, dark eyes, and it thus resembles a lot of modern horror ghosts and zombies (similar monsters appeared in three or four previews before the movie). The monster even hisses at one point. Lame. The film's biggest mistake is the climax, where the characters suddenly become total morons. My enthusiasm for the film fell a lot during the sequence. The characters in general are pretty bland, though they're perhaps a tiny bit better than your average horror film (I did quite like Monroe's performance). I loved the John Carpenter-esque score.",7,3,44,30 March 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," The apes are awesome, the humans are uninteresting
","The plot of this film is very similar to the recent horror movie Splice. Here, James Franco plays a scientist whose big presentation flops when his experimental chimp goes nuts and attacks a bunch of people. When ordered to destroy all of his experimental subjects, he steals a baby chimp to raise and experiment on at home. The ape, which his father (John Lithgow) names Caesar, is super-intelligent, but has his animal urges, too. This eventually leads to Caesar's discovery and imprisonment in a primate house. There he becomes a leader to the other apes, and, after he steals Franco's Alzheimer's vaccine, he makes them super-intelligent, too, which leads to an ape revolt. The movie is sometimes very well plotted, and at other times it's pure rote Hollywood filmmaking. The human story doesn't work as well as the ape story. John Lithgow's not bad as the Alzheimer's sufferer who inspires Franco's work, but Franco himself is fairly dull, and his love interest, Slumdog Millionaire's Freida Pinto, has absolutely not a thing to do. Whenever the apes are on screen, though, it's an excellent film. Caesar is created with motion capture technology, with Lord of the Rings' Andy Serkis performing. He's absolutely brilliant. Not an exaggeration at all: you can see every thought in that chimp's head. While the special effects are easily identified as CGI (I think every ape in the film is CGI, because the difference would be too bothersome if any real apes were included), they are about as good as that technology is ever going to get. There are a lot of references to the original film, some of which are terrible (two of the film's most famous lines are included and sound ridiculous), but some of which (like naming the orangutan Maurice) made me smile.",7,2,4,8 August 2011
JFK," Mostly great, with a few bad sequences that significantly harm the film
","I'm not especially familiar with all aspects of the Kennedy assassination (it was well before my time), but one thing's for sure: the Warren Commission's final word is more than a little incredible. I don't know how much of Oliver Stone's film is provable fact, how much of it is loony conjecture, or how much he just plain made up (he says none, but others have denied that). What I do know is that the film, even though it runs at 3 and a half hours, is engaging, exciting, gripping and suspenseful. I'm not a big fan of movies that follow investigations, but it's great here. And I especially hate courtroom dramas, but the final sequences of the movie represent an extremely tight tour-de-force. The film is at its best when it's exploring the mystery, and, confoundingly, at its very worst when it takes time to develop its characters. There are two scenes particularly when Jim Garrison's wife (played by Sissy Spacek at her very worst) accosts him for not spending enough time with his family. I'm thinking, 'HELLO! Most important investigation in American history going on here!' I think his kids would forgive him in the future for being a bit inattentive at the time. The second of these scenes, where Costner explains to his kids that he won't be leaving their mommy, almost had me throwing stuff at the screen it was so sappy. Kevin Costner isn't very interesting, and, besides, from what I've read Stone really softened the character of Jim Garrison, so any character development on that front is dishonest. Most of the best acting comes from the massive supporting cast, where almost anybody is liable to show up. I was quite happy when John Larroquette showed up, and even happier when Donald Sutherland appeared. And Brian Doyle Murray as Jack Ruby? Awesome. My favorite performance by far was Kevin Bacon. I always feel bad for the guy, because he's spent such a long career acting in middling roles. He really is a fine actor, which he gets to prove every so often. He only has five or six minutes in this film, but he's great.",8,3,14,29 May 2006
Gone Girl," Enormously entertaining
","I stepped away from horror for a few hours on Saturday to see this. I wasn't particularly eager to see it, but the reviews were too good for me to skip. I must say, it's amazing. I always say that Fincher is a good director, but he's completely dependent on the material he's given. Fortunately, the material here (a novel by Gillian Flynn, with a screenplay written by her) is excellent, and Fincher paces it beautifully. Also backing it up wonderfully is another great score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. The story shouldn't be gone into too much - though I knew the two major twists and still followed along with giddy enjoyment to every moment - but it opens with unhappy husband Ben Affleck discovering that his wife, Rosamund Pike, has gone missing. Evidence points heavily towards him, but he insists of his innocence. Soon the whole world seems against him. My favorite part of the film was the satire of the 24 hour news media. Missi Pyle is great as a loathsome TV news host obviously based on Nancy Grace. There are tons of excellent supporting performances, including Carrie Coon, Kim Dickens, Tyler Perry (yes, he's good!), Neil Patrick Harris, Patrick Fugit, Casey Wilson and Emily Ratajkowski amongst others. My second favorite film of 2014 so far and Fincher's best work ever.",10,7,21,11 October 2014
Drive," Excellent
","I absolutely despised Refn's previous film, Valhalla Rising, which was a ridiculous stylistic exercise that exhibited a great eye for photography but nothing else. Well, Drive is also mostly a stylistic exercise with great photography, but this one's a keeper. Ryan Gosling stars as a stunt driver/mechanic/aspiring racecar driver who moonlights as an uber-professional getaway driver for criminals. After getting emotionally involved with his neighbor (the drop-dead gorgeous Carey Mulligan) and her son, Gosling agrees to help her ex-con husband (Oscar Isaac) pull off a heist. It goes wrong, and Gosling becomes a mob target. So, yeah, the story's nothing new or special. And the performances are nothing to write home about, either. It's all in the direction, the cinematography, the sound and the editing. And, man, it's just a beautifully made film. It feels kind of out of place in 2011, more resembling a 1970s auteurist project. It's pure cinema, not unlike the other great English language film of 2011 (so far), The Tree of Life. Not quite as profound as that one, but, still, quite great. Also starring Albert Brooks, Bryan Cranston, Ron Perlman and Christina Hendricks.",10,4,10,25 September 2011
The Theory of Everything," Totally cliché, though also totally inoffensive
","A biopic of Stephen Hawking, mostly focused on his relationship with his first wife, Jane (the film is based on her own autobiography). It has little interest in what Stephen Hawking is about, except for very cursorily. I guess that's not a huge problem, but, frankly, I don't know that much about Hawking and wished I had gotten to learn more from this movie. It does deal a lot with his disease and health struggles, which I suppose many are more interested in. The film will surely be most notable for its two lead performances. Eddie Redmayne certainly nails the physical side of Hawking and projects a very clear character. Felicity Jones, though, does better work as the woman who has to work very hard to make their lives work. No one else really registers much (though David Thewlis and Emma Watson, among many others, are featured), but that doesn't really matter. The filmmaking is competent but not notable. James Marsh, best known for his documentaries Man on Wire and Project Nim, has done good work in feature filmmaking before with the underrated The King. Here he doesn't get much to register. My favorite thing besides the lead performances was the very pleasant score, by Johan Johansson. Probably worth seeing on video, but don't go out of your way.",6,130,232,16 November 2014
X-Men: The Last Stand," Not as good as X2, but still pretty good
","Worthy follow-up to the near-masterpiece X2, perhaps the best comic book movie ever. Ratner isn't as talented as Bryan Singer. The film is a lot clunkier and imbalanced. The plot is somewhat less clear and a bit slow-moving. But the story is good, and it is generally very entertaining. Several of the action sequences are exceptional. My favorite sequence was the one where Juggernaut chased Kitty Pryde through Alcatraz Prison (she can move through walls  he can smash through walls). I'm sure a lot of die-hard geeks will have plenty to say  some of their favorite characters are disposed of rather nonchalantly. A couple of the main characters  Cyclops and Rogue  have almost no screen time. I was a little bothered that Ratner and his screenwriters weren't able to wring the proper amount of emotion out of the deaths of some major characters. I won't say who, but several characters go away in one way or another. Two of the main villains have more powerful final moments than three of the main good guys. Of course, the title hints that this will be the last X-Men movie, but there is plenty more story to tell and I will certainly be in line for the inevitable X-Men 4: Give Us More Money.",7,2,3,29 May 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Huge improvement over the first installment
","I found the first installment of this series pretty good, but ultimately sloppy. It was just too repetitive, with the characters doing nothing but travelling forward, stopping sporadically to fight battles against forces of faceless monsters which ridiculously outnumbered them. The second installment, of course, picks up right where the first one ended, although it has broken into three narrative tracks. The cutting between the three makes the first half of the film rather uneven. The plotline of Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas defending the people of Rohan is especially slow, and there isn't enough exposition to explain what the heck is going on. I'm actually glad for that, as I'd rather sit through incomprehensible plot than have to listen to twenty more minutes of explaining who the heck these people are and what the heck is going on. I turned to my friend, a long-time lover of the novels, and asked him and he quickly caught me up. Pippin and Merry, the two Hobbits who were captured by orcs at the end of the first movie, escape and run into a sacred forest and are captured by a giant talking tree called an ent. This plotline is slow, too, but the tree monsters were neat enough to hold my attention.The third plotline, the one with Frodo and Sam, is by far the most interesting. Gollum, the former owner of the ring, now obsessed with it, attacks them and is captured. He soon becomes their guide when Frodo begins to sympathize with his downfall. Gollum is by far the most interesting character in the film, like Yoda in The Empire Strikes Back. This is the first computer-generated character to work completely. Except for his eyes, I'd accept him as a physical entity. And his story and performance are just so tragic that these parts were nearly overwhelming at times. It's too bad they don't award voice characterizations (and I can't find who did it on imdb). The special effects guys really, truly deserve to win an Oscar for their work here. He was so interesting, I wanted the whole movie to be based from his point of view for a lot of the film.Fortunately, the other two stories do begin to work after a while. There's a great, kinetic battle scene with some wolves that was apparently not in the novel, which, of course, angers all the nerds. This leads to some material about Liv Tyler's character which was also not in the book. My LOTR nerd friend admitted that these scenes were good, and, in my mind, that was the first real scene that got me to give the slightest care for Aragorn, who seems so important but, to me, seemed so uninteresting in the first movie and a lot of this one. The elf and dwarf also begin to come into their own, although the dwarf is often used solely for comic relief, and it's not especially funny. A lot of the movie focuses around a huge battle fought by these characters. They have armies now, so this battle scene is much less ridiculous than the ones in the first film. It's actually enormously entertaining. Pippin and Merry also become more interesting, although they're never going to be, I fear, as interesting as anyone else. The ents whom they hang around with are really cool, though. The ents' attack on one of the towers (I do have to admit that I didn't even realize there were two myself) makes for a very neat scene.My biggest complaint is about the same as my biggest complaint about the first film. Why are the villains so boring? The orcs and their kin are just dull, faceless villains. They're fodder for the good guys' armies. They run around and yowl, and that's about it. Why can't there be a few generals or something that have interesting things to say? Christopher Lee, who did make a bit of an impression in the first film, is totally shafted in this one. He does little more than sit in his tower and watch his troops march away. There's also a new villain, an Ozzy Osbourne-looking guy named Wormtongue, who is controlling the king of Rohan with magic. Do you really believe that they would allow a guy named Wormtongue to come into their palace, let alone advise the king?Despite this film's numerous flaws, I can't think of another film of 2002 that really entertained me more than this one. 8/10.",9,2,6,5 January 2003
The Mist," The short of it is, Marcia Gay Harden ruins it. But it's still pretty good.
","Another Stephen King story, this one about a group of people in Maine (of course) who hold up in a grocery store when a mysterious mist, possibly obscuring something dangerous, descends upon their town. The first twenty or thirty minutes of this movie promise one of the best horror movies of the past decade. And there's a lot afterward that would lend to that assessment, too. Unfortunately, The Mist has a couple of fatal flaws that nearly make it a bad movie. First and foremost, Marcia Gay Harden's ultra-religious nutbag character. You know exactly where they're going with this right away, but you don't hope it takes up too much screen time. But, lo and behold, it becomes a major plot point, maybe THE major plot point, and you're just praying for it to end with a bullet in her forehead. And then there's the unintentionally hilarious ending. I'm guessing that in the Stephen King novella, the characters stranded in the out-of-gas car wait for maybe more than thirty seconds before they decide to do something drastic (ETA: apparently the final image of the book is the characters driving off into the mist, the reader never learning what happened to them). These are, after all, people who have fought for their lives for the previous hour and fifty-five minutes. And then the predictable irony, with one character on his knees shouting like a dufus while gas-masked Army guys stroll on by. Yeah, sue me, I laughed. Still, I'd recommend it for the awesome set-up and a handful of excellent sequences.",8,0,1,4 November 2010
Stardust," Provides more fun than all of the summer blockbusters put together
","The 14 year-old in me is immensely happy that they're now able to make really good looking fantasy movies, and that they're all the rage, what with Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia making loads of cash at the box office. This year will see (and already has seen) several more, most notably The Golden Compass, which has the most exciting trailer I've seen this year. Stardust, based on a novel by Neil Gaiman, showed up in theaters this week with little more than a peep. I saw no previews for it, only a couple of commercials. The critical reaction is kind of blah. I wouldn't even have seen it if not for the fact that I have to wait on a friend to see The Bourne Ultimatum, and that nothing else interesting opened this weekend. Well, if you'll forgive the horrible pun, the stars must have been rightly aligned, because I went to see Stardust, and I loved it. It's not a huge movie like Lord of the Rings. The plot line is your very basic fantasy quest (the hero sets out to look for a fallen star) filled with obstacles. But within that basic outline, the story is lively and imaginative. It's simply aiming to be a lot of fun, and a charming little romance. And it succeeds wonderfully. There were a lot of big films this summer, but none of them were nearly as fun as this one. There's a lot going on, but the story is told well and is almost entirely coherent. It isn't a masterpiece, but it definitely can occupy the same kind of ground that something like The Princess Bride has (though I don't like it quite as much as the earlier film). A lot of fun to be had here if you're a fan of the genre.",9,290,333,12 August 2007
I Am Legend," It starts off pretty well, but then hobbles itself with its cliché baddies
","The latest cinematic adaptation of the Richard Matheson novel, and the first one to use its real name. The other two are The Last Man on Earth, starring Vincent Price, and The Omega Man, starring Charlton Heston. Haven't seen the Price version yet, but The Omega Man is a sentimental favorite of mine. Cheesy and fun, loaded with the trappings of its time (1971). Lawrence's version is more serious-minded. He wants to make the audience feel what New York City would be like if you were the only person there. And he succeeds very well. It looks brilliant. Will Smith is capable as the only survivor in NYC. This is more of a horror flick than The Omega Man, and it works well as that. My biggest complaint, though, is that this film really rips off 28 Days Later. The mutants of I Am Legend are pretty much exactly the same as the rage infected people of that film, mostly mindless zombies who roar a lot and hunger for human blood (The Descent also came to mind a lot, especially with the aversion to light the baddies have). With the monsters seeming so much like they did in that one, and with the post-apocalyptic setting being pretty much exactly the same, it feels more like a remake of that than it does of The Omega Man. And frankly, 28 Days Later didn't need to be remade. Not so soon, anyway. Heck, the sequel to 28 Days Later, 28 Weeks Later, did a much better job differentiating itself from its predecessor than this film does. Still, the film is quite entertaining, and one of the better blockbusters of the year.",7,2,5,16 December 2007
The Bourne Legacy," A worthy follow-up to the original Bourne trilogy
","Seemingly a cash-in to keep a popular series alive, The Bourne Legacy turned out quite a bit better than I expected it to be. Tony Gilroy (Michael Clayton) is a good choice to take the reins, and it connects well with the series' ongoing story. It's kind of a side thing rather than a true sequel. Jeremy Renner plays another super-soldier from the Treadstone program. After Jason Bourne's attempt at escaping his handlers, the Treadstone program is hastily canceled by the government, which basically means that their super-soldiers are to be terminated. Renner is the only survivor of that group. He's now out of the special drug the government gives him to keep him going, and he goes after Rachel Weisz, a doctor who has frequently worked with him in the past. Weisz was also targeted by the government, since she knows too much, and she and Renner escape together, fleeing to Manilla to search for the drugs. Meanwhile, a team at the CIA (including Edward Norton, Stacy Keach and others) are trying to find them and take them out. There are some particularly chilling sequences, most notably Zeljko Ivanek's freakout, which might prove hard to watch after recent gun violence in the United States, but that also makes it even more horrifying. The action sequences are just as well done as the previous movies (those who hated the Greengrass Bourne movies will be happy to know that Gilroy drops the shaky cam almost entirely - it's still hand-held, but barely noticeable). The film does get bogged down in some of the talkier sequences, which often seem to be filled with a bunch of techno-babble, but when it moves, man, it moves. Renner is a fine lead, and Weisz is very good, too.",7,4,9,30 December 2012
Dog Day Afternoon," Good but flawed
","Quite an intense experience. Lumet's direction is quite good, and this is easily one of Al Pacino's best performances. Seeing it makes me mourn for what he used to be. He really needs to fire his agent right now so he can land himself better material than The Recruit and S1m0ne. While Dog Day Afternoon is very entertaining and well made, it does have some major problems. I think its depiction of gay characters, the ones besides Pacino's, that is, is dated if not offensive. It's almost like you can hear Lumet standing behind the camera telling Chris Surandon to 'queer it to the max!' and 'get that wrist limper!' You know he actually got an Oscar nomination for that?! The hostages are all over the map, too. Sometimes they're as scared as hell and sometimes they're having a ball. It's never consistent, not even within individual characters. There are a lot of interesting social issues raised, but the politics are a bit murky. Still, Pacino holds the film together so well that these things, even though they are pretty big flaws, seem small. I can't see how the Academy could choose Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest over Al Pacino in Dog Day Afternoon. The two films are about equal in value, but Pacino comes off as a full character.",8,2,5,17 February 2003
Cars 2," Dishearteningly bad
","Pixar's Cars was easily their weakest feature, yet it certainly had a charm to it. While the car characters themselves looked a little cheap, the world they lived in had nice, pretty detail, and their Rocky Mountain hometown was lovely. Cars 2 not only replaces Cars as Pixar's weakest, it's actually dishearteningly awful. It jettisons every ounce of charm from the original, as well as the detail (probably because it was made as a 3D movie, so the backgrounds aren't going to be seen anyway), and puts Larry the freakin' Cable Guy in the lead (Owen Wilson's Lightning McQueen is barely even in the film, and would probably be like fourth billed if not for his contract). This film belongs on the shelf next to Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector and Witless Protection, not Wall-E and Up. The plot has McQueen and 'Mater (Larry's character, if you don't know) going around the world to a series of races so McQueen can prove he's the fastest car alive. 'Mater is mistaken for a secret agent by a James Bond-like Michael Caine-mobile and Emily Mortimer and has to foil an evil plot by someone or other. I really couldn't be bothered to give a damn about any of it. It's very busy, and I'm sure small children will like it, but it's vapid as Hell. It really feels like one of those Disney direct-to-DVD sequels, possibly even worse. Let's hope Pixar will learn its lesson from this one.",4,2,6,11 December 2011
Kick-Ass," Interesting and entertaining, if not entirely successful
","Troubling, as pretty much everybody has pointed out. But I have to applaud the filmmakers and their studio for making it an R-Rated movie. Sure, watching kids get the crap kicked out of them and shot at is more than a tad bothersome, but it would be so much worse if the film backed off of the blood and violence. Without being able to see the pain and nastiness of violence, you're making it look innocent and fun, and if this had ended up a PG-13 film, it would have been much more abhorrent. Personally, I think the film has two major flaws which hold it back from being anything great. First off, the kid who plays Kick-Ass, Aaron Johnson, is just awful. I could barely put up with him when he was on screen. It was mostly his high-pitched, whiny voice. I really didn't want to listen to him, and I could never give a crap what was happening to him. Like a lot of the audience, I was always eager to get back to Big Daddy and Hit Girl (Nicholas Cage and Chloe Grace Moretz, whom you may remember as the precocious (and horribly annoying) little sister from last year's (500) Days of Summer). The structure of the story was really quite excellent, keeping those two characters in the background for the first half of the movie or so, so I wouldn't want that to change. The film just needed a more charismatic, or maybe even funny guy in the lead role. The second problem is what the film becomes by the end. I think it makes some salient points about the whole super-hero fantasy, that in real life anyone who'd try it would just get their ass kicked, and, as I said above, the violence and blood really sell the idea that this would be nasty business. When Cage and Moretz go nuts on people, at least at the beginning, it's not awesome. You're watching two nutjobs, one just a child, kill people. So it is kind of disappointing that the final act descends into a full-blown super-hero fantasy, with jet-packs even! And the happy ending coda is even lamer. Despite its major flaws, I did end up liking the movie. And, yeah, I loved Hit Girl and Big Daddy. Those characters are just fantastic. I think Bad Lieutenant is going to mark the turning point in Cage's career where he's insane and he's never coming back. I don't even think directors try to restrain him anymore. I love that, when he's in his costume, he talks just like Adam West from the old Batman show. Director Matthew Vaughn (whose previous film was the excellent fantasy/romance Stardust) really shouldn't have let Cage do that, but yeah. It's amusing. Moretz is most certainly a talent to watch. Hopefully she won't go nuts in real life, robbing liquor stores in a Hit Girl outfit in a few years.",7,2,9,25 April 2010
Gran Torino," A mess of a film, with a lot of bad parts and a lot of good parts
","A confused and sometimes infuriating film, but also one that is undoubtedly entertaining and occasionally even touching. Eastwood stars as a grizzled Korean War veteran and widower with the worst family possible. Remember the family in Million Dollar Baby, so unbelievably crass that you just wanted to hit them, as well as Paul Haggis, who created the characters? The family here is ten times worse. Clint's teenage granddaughter attends her grandmother's funeral showing cleavage and her ample rear. And then her father complains that Clint is angry about the disrespect the girl is showing his dead wife! Even more confusing, Clint's son, both of his sons, actually, are dressed in suits and ties, while their sons wear football jerseys and daughters wear revealing clothing. If the parents are dressing up, wouldn't they force the kids to dress up, too? Who designed the costumes here? Who edited it? Who wrote it? And who the Hell directed it? Little of it makes any logical sense. The main body of the story is about Clint's dealing with his neighbors, a Hmong family. He becomes closer to the family after he unwittingly saves the neighbor boy, Thao, from his gang-banging cousin. Thao had previously tried to steal Clint's prized Gran Torino, and in exchange for his crime, as well as Clint's heroics, he agrees to help Clint out with chores and odd jobs. They become friends. Note to screenwriters: the Asian kids next door won't generally hang around you if you call them 'slopes' and 'zipperheads' to their face, no matter how much heart you have buried under a gruff exterior. Seriously, the racial epithets flow so freely, and are so often meant as comedy, that Gran Torino is going to face some major backlash because of it. There's even a memorable sequence in the film that claims that this is the way grown men speak to each other. Political correctness is, after all, for vaginae. Movies about racists aren't necessarily a bad thing, but Gran Torino crosses the line into offensiveness. This film hasn't opened in the Twin Cities yet, where the majority of Hmong people live in the United States, but I expect a slew of letters to the editor when it sees its release. So, yeah, the film has its problems. But I did find the relationship that arises between Clint and Thao, as well as Thao's sister, Sue, quite touching (if cliché). Eastwood gives a fine performance. I wouldn't call it Oscar-worthy, but it certainly beats the crap out of his performance in Million Dollar Baby, for which he was nominated for an Oscar. Its other Oscar possibility is for the title song, sung by Eastwood himself over the ending credits. It's simply awful.",7,2,12,23 December 2008
Hero," I think this is what God invented light for
","My mind is just so clouded with enthusiasm that I'm not sure I can judge Hero well, but I definitely had the feeling that I was watching a film that would instantly be one of my very favorites. I loved it, every damn second of it, to death. It can be compared to any number of films, directed by any number of directors around the world, but it comes out as something completely unique and amazing. The one reference I would like to emphasize, because I'm guessing that it hasn't been noticed (although I missed every previous conversation in the preceding two years surrounding Hero, and I'm doubtlessly wrong) is this: Hero reminds me a heck of a lot of Alexander Nevsky. Nevsky is a straight-out propaganda piece, aimed towards WWII audiences, and Hero veers late in the film towards a weird theme of Chinese national pride, which is certainly a kind of propaganda. But neither film is too interesting in that aspect, except from a purely historical point of view. Nevsky is constantly misunderstood by modern audiences; it feels archaic, and it's a deliberate archaism. Sergei Eisenstein invented an entirely unique style that, as far as I know, has never been copied. Similarly, Zhang's creativity explodes into something the likes of which I've never even imagined before. Hero is stylized beyond belief, with ridiculous theatrics in one corner, and visuals controlled with a color co-ordination controlled with an iron fist in the other. To me, the nationalist epic intention for Hero is moot. This is the invention of mythology, a mythology that we're never meant to believe anyway, but just to absorb. The complex narrative structure is reminiscent of Rashomon, but I think it's using its idealized, and often lying flashbacks in a different fashion. I'm guessing that some of the film's critics harped on this point, that many of these passionately told stories and miraculously eye-popping set-pieces are in fact invented by the characters on screen. This criticism, I think, is just when talking about, say, The Usual Suspects, but not with Hero. I haven't come close to plumbing the depths of this movie yet  just far too awed at what I saw  but I like the concept of these tragic, mythical heroes having story after story woven around them. For instance, the story of Broken Sword and Flying Snow is told at least four times. Each time, the plot differs slightly, with the events happening a bit differently, but always with the same results, and, more importantly, with the same emotions. It's like these characters are so well known, their story arises spontaneously from their character traits.This film was obviously made on the heels of Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. I absolutely love Lee's film, but Hero surpasses it by miles. I love watching Lee's film, feeling its emotions, watching its startling action sequences, which were so new to me at the time (they still hold up, of course). When I watch CTHD, though, as much as I love the tragic romance and the story of the cocksure teenager, I anticipate the fight scenes. As good as everything else is, the action takes center stage. In Hero, the action scenes are even better, more beautiful, more startling, and more inventive. And they are just the icing on the cake. My one and only complaint about the film has to do with CTHD: the music. It's far too close to the beautiful score of CTHD, almost matching it note-for-note at times. It perhaps should have been much more Chinese. Other than that, what is there left to say? A lot, I expect, but on subsequent viewings. I ought to say that I am in utter disbelief that I was able to catch this at my local multiplex. I was sure that it had been dubbed, though I had not heard that they dubbed it. As far as I know, it is the first foreign language film ever to play at that theater. I was sure I would have to wait for DVD. I wonder if it will stay there more than a week. I wish I had time to see it once a day. Hell, every showing. I haven't slept in 22 hours and I know I'm just babbling now, but I'm pretty sure that I have a new favorite for the current decade (and millennium, while we're at it). Perhaps it is the only recent film that may be able to break into my hallowed top 10. Okay, now I know I'm crazy! 10/10.",10,1,2,28 August 2004
The Hurt Locker," The suspense sequences are awesome
","War/action drama about an American bomb squad in the Iraq war. The film is extremely apolitical - the Iraq setting is almost incidental. The themes and incidents could, except for the technology involved and some of the elements of the suspense (notably that the fact that the enemy is made up of Iraqi insurgents, and it's difficult to tell the enemy apart from anyone else), this could just as easily have been about a police bomb squad or one in any other war. What makes The Hurt Locker special is its suspense sequences. God, it's been a long time since any Hollywood action director got suspense right. Bigelow takes the old Hitchcock maxim about the ticking of the bomb being more exciting than the explosion to its logical extremes. There are a handful of bomb diffusion sequences in the film, and they are all very tense (there's also a sequence where the group, along with some British allies, are pinned down by snipers, that is reminiscent of Ford's The Lost Patrol). It can be a very impressive film, and in a summer overrun by idiotic movies like X-Men Origins: Wolverine and Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen, it's not at all surprising that so many critics have declared this a masterpiece. It's not, though. The main problem is that the human story surrounding the action/suspense setpieces is nothing special. Jeremy Renner plays the new leader of this squad, with his two veteran assistants, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty. They lost their previous Sergeant through carelessness, and they are eager to protect the new guy. But Renner is an adrenaline junkie. He dares what no one else will (screw robots! I'll march right up to that bomb without a second thought!). There is a lot of tension between the three men because of this. Meanwhile, Renner wonders how he can ever return to normal life with his wife (Evangeline Lily) and young son without the excitement of the field. There's also a subplot about a young Iraqi boy Renner befriends who disappears. The stuff around the setpieces isn't necessarily bad, it's just not exceptional. I could also complain a little about the action sequences themselves. They are definitely exciting, but, if you think them through, they don't seem too realistic. For instance, in the opening sequence, when the first Sergeant is approaching a bomb, Geraghty sees a butcher across the street pull out his cell phone. Geraghty yells at him to put it down, but hesitates in taking a shot. Yeah right. This guy would be dead the second he pulled out that phone (and he should be; there's no room for mistakes in this kind of situation). You would really hope the real guys in this situation would be much more careful than Renner is. If these exceptionally trained individuals weren't that trained, you'd think they'd all be dead by now. And in the sniper sequence, when one British sniper gets waxed, Mackie grabs his gun and seemingly goes to the exact same spot to snipe. What? I won't at all be surprised to see a ton of technical debunkings of this film as it becomes more popular. I've already seen a few on the film's IMDb board. Technical problems don't bother me too much, though, and I still quite enjoyed the movie.",9,3,10,12 July 2009
Ex Machina," Well made but uninteresting and predictable
","The advancement of artificial intelligence to human levels has been a favorite subject for science fiction writers since the concept was invented, and it's been a popular subject for sci-fi movies for a long time now. Alex Garland's Ex Machina does little new with the subject, and contains very few surprises. Despite being fairly unoriginal, it's still an enjoyable piece of cinema. It survives on looks and the talent in front of the camera. Domhnall Gleeson stars (and is easily the least interesting of the basically four person cast) as a programmer who is selected by internet genius Oscar Isaac to test his new, advanced robot, Ava (Alicia Vikander). She is more than intriguing. She's gorgeous, and, against his better judgement, Gleeson becomes attracted to her as he tests her. Vikander is very convincing as a robot. Sounds like an insult, but her performance is very subtle in the way she emotes. Isaac is fun as always. The fourth person in the cast is Sonoyo Mizuno, who plays Isaac's Japanese servant - not difficult to figure out what her deal is, but I liked whenever she popped up. She and Isaac share a dance that's easily my favorite moment in the film. The movie's production design and cinematography, as well as its score, are all very good. Worth a watch, but I'd recommend waiting for video or streaming.",7,23,48,11 May 2015
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Twig-thin, pretentious garbage
","I should have known it was going to happen eventually. There's always one potential Oscar film that I absolutely hate, and in 2008 it is The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. To get it out of the way immediately: yes, the film is technically accomplished. It totally deserves to be nominated for all the technical categories, including score and cinematography. It is absolutely gorgeous at times. But so freakin' what? The film behind those technical accomplishments is just plain bad. The film is about a man who is born old and ages backward. He falls in love with a girl who is in reality the same age as he, but he has to wait for her to grow up and for him to grow down. Cool concept, yeah? I was aware of this story since way back when Spike Jonze was talking about doing it, around 2000. I've been waiting for it for the better part of this decade. But you know what? It's just a gimmick. I don't know what F. Scott Fitzgerald's original story is about, how he uses that gimmick, but Fincher and screenwriter Eric Roth do absolutely nothing with it. The backward aging thing doesn't provide any insight into how a life is lived. Ben Button the character has no insight, besides a few banal observations. The film has no historical point of view. Set in New Orleans from the end of WWI and ending, chronologically, at Hurricane Katrina, it has almost nothing to say about the 20th or 21st Centuries. This is particularly obvious when there are black and white characters interacting with each other as if no such thing as racial tension existed. Many of the film's critics note its similarities to Forrest Gump, which was also written by Eric Roth. Yes, there are many honest and insightful arguments against Forrest Gump, but at least it didn't turn its back on history the way Ben Button does (though it does, of course, polish it far too much). So little happens in the film, it's almost amazing that they were able to stretch it out for nearly three hours. The film just gives us bland sentiments, two dimensional characters whom I didn't come close to caring about, lots of talk about life and death but no real philosophies on it and no sense of time or place, except for the most generic sort possible. I haven't mentioned the actors yet. This disaster isn't at all their fault. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, both fine actors, are given little to do. I guess you could kind of praise Pitt's old man act, but much of the impressiveness of that is due to the special effects and makeup. Taraji P. Henson is getting a lot of praise for her role as Queenie, Benjamin's adoptive mother. She's probably the best actor in the film, but this kind of mammy role is below her talents. No black woman should have to waste her time in such a stereotypical role. The only performances I liked at all were those of Jared Harris, who is a lot of fun as a sea captain, and Tilda Swinton, who is always good. I blame most of this movie on Roth, whose script is so extraordinarily vapid, but Fincher is partly at fault. This just isn't his kind of movie, and it's obvious he isn't able to handle sentimental material. I hate his most famous films, Se7en and Fight Club, because I find them both disgusting, cruel and cynical in a dangerous way. He found his perfect match, in my mind, last year with Zodiac, which utilized his clinical style perfectly. He seems to approach movies with a detached procedure, much as the investigators and journalists of Zodiac are supposed to operate. A grand love story, which Button purports to be (but never is), requires a director more in touch with his emotions.",5,5,12,4 January 2009
Transformers," Entertaining enough most of the way through, but certainly not great
","Okay, I'm pretty much of the generation to which this film is aimed. I was a kid when this show was on the air. I wasn't a huge fan myself, though. I was more of a He-Man kind of guy. I only barely remember watching Transformers. My parents were unwilling to buy me the toys because they were too expensive and they broke easily during their transformations. I really wasn't at all interested in seeing this movie, except maybe on video to see how bad it was. But I'd heard a lot of good word-of-mouth reports and my friends wanted to see it, so I caved in. A one word review: Meh. A little more: it ain't terrible, certainly a lot better than I expected. The film sustains itself with a beleaguered and just plain weird sense of humor that, if not hilarious, is undeniably amusing. In general, there's just too much going on. There are like fifteen different plot threads. The story isn't too hard to follow and mostly makes sense, but a lot of it could be cut out (for instance, the second most important piece of female eye candy, Rachael Taylor, and her hacker buddy played by Anthony Anderson). The action is quite fun most of the time, but the giant final battle has so much going on that it gets more than a little difficult to follow. I might have actually given the movie a passing grade if not for the quick and unsatisfying final battle between Optimus Prime and Megatron. Transformers is pretty close to being worthwhile, but in the end it's too big , exhausting and disappointing to really recommend.",6,3,8,22 July 2007
Sing Street," So sweet
","John Carney now has a trilogy of these 'let's make music and fall in love' movies. Sure, they're mostly the same, but they're all delightful. This one is probably my least favorite of the three, but it's still very enjoyable. Ferdia Walsh-Peelo plays Conor, a teen boy with a dissolving family, who ends up in a new school when his parents can't afford a better one. He's immediately the focus of bullying, but that doesn't matter at all when he runs into Raphina (Lucy Boynton, a born star if there ever was one). He lies to her, telling her he's in a band, so he and his friends quickly form one. This film is all about the romance, unlike the previous two films where the romance developed from the music. Yet the love of music is a strong theme in this one, too, with Conor's older brother (Jack Reynor) tutoring him passionately on the subject. And the music the band, Sing Street, ends up creating is excellent, at least if you're cool with '80s music. Carney's trilogy probably represents the last three times I felt I had to buy a soundtrack as soon as I left the theater. I'd be perfectly fine with Carney just hitting these same notes in the future, because they're lovely.",8,4,6,15 May 2016
Children of Men," Has some minor flaws and not the strongest storyline, but is so astoundingly created it's hard to care too much
","Impressive as all Hell, at least from the standpoint of direction. There are a couple of long takes that are just about the greatest sequences I've ever seen. Cuarón is a master of putting the audience in the middle of the action. I've never felt more like I was in a war zone before. The collapse of society has never been more vividly depicted. However (and I hate to say 'however' when there's so much to be amazed at), I didn't absolutely love the movie. It creates a frightening world, but the story that goes along with it is not equal to the creation. It's decent, but nothing fantastic. And the characters weren't especially great, either. Only Clive Owen gives a notable performance, and he was even better in Inside Man. I also thought that exposition in the film was handled clumsily. How many left to right tracking shots do we need of photographs and newspaper headlines? Every time Cuarón wants to tell us something about a new character, or explicate something that has happened in the past, that's how he does it. Okay, despite some complaints, which I guess are major but I was too impressed to care too much, this is still one of the best of the year.",9,5,11,8 January 2007
Million Dollar Baby," Probably wouldn't crack my top 50 of 2004
","I don't understand all the praise. Sure, it's a pretty good movie, but it's flat, obvious, and not at all memorable. Eastwood's last film, Mystic River, was ten times better. Hilary Swank plays a boxer who persists in trying to get trainer Clint Eastwood to make her his student. He finally does accept her, especially after his friend, Morgan Freeman, who works as a janitor in his gym, convinces him of her talent. Most of the movie is a pretty straightforward boxing drama. Swank and Eastwood become each other's surrogate father and daughter, both making up for lost loved ones (Swank's father is dead, and Eastwood's daughter refuses to talk to him). The final act adds a tearjerker. There is also a poorly developed subplot about a few of the regulars at Eastwood's gym. It's slow, but mostly entertaining. Swank is good, but nowhere near the level that she hit with Boys Don't Cry. It's impossible to believe that Eastwood got nominated, especially over Paul Giamatti for Sideways. His direction is fine, but he can barely speak. Plus, he's so old it looks like his skeleton is trying to escape from his body. Morgan Freeman isn't especially great in his supporting role. He can't speak clearly, either. He narrates the film, and it can often be very hard to understand him. Million Dollar Baby is worth seeing, but it certainly isn't award-worthy. 7/10.",7,5,13,31 January 2005
Casualties of War," A powerful story, poorly told
","Incredibly uneven Vietnam drama from pulp master Brian De Palma. De Palma's the problem here - he's really the kind of director who needs to stay away from serious subject matters, because he's too ham-fisted to handle it with any tact. He does very well with more B-level stuff, and he can definitely be masterful in movies like Carrie and Sisters (though he screws that stuff up as often as not, too). Casualties of War is about a five-person squadron (Michael J. Fox, John Leguizamo, John C. Reilly, Don Harvey and led by Sean Penn) who kidnap a teenage Vietnamese girl, march her into the jungle, rape her and then murder her. Fox is the lone objector in the group, but there's nothing he can do to stop them. He's just a private under Penn's command. Plus, they all have guns and are presumably better at using them than he is. When the group returns from the mission, Fox tries to do the right thing and bring about justice, but his superiors (including Ving Rhames) are mostly unwilling to listen. Yeah, this is powerful stuff. The problem is, De Palma doesn't think we will know that if he just presents it. He has to throw it at us, underlining every little thing, and giving the actors big speeches (one particular shot with Fox seems so clearly to be meant as his Oscar clip that I had to giggle). The worst part of the film by far is the score. Who wrote it? None other than the great Ennio Morricone. I guess everyone has an off day, but I've never heard Morricone deliver a score that was even mediocre (okay, maybe his John Carpenter knock-off score for The Thing). This one is downright putrid. The whole film is terribly overscored. I think that was done to go along with Sean Penn's overacting. The guy's frequently been accused of overdoing it, but generally I think his methody style works. Not here. He's never been worse. By comparison, Michael J. Fox actually isn't half bad. It's pretty clear he wasn't meant for heavy drama, though. Brian De Palma made a startlingly similar movie about the Iraq War in 2007, the even worse Redacted. I know both of these stories are true and they certainly are both subjects worthy of a film treatment, but De Palma was not the one to do it. And, having done both of these movies, it almost seems like he has a beef with U.S. soldiers.",5,12,25,27 September 2009
Big Hero 6," Fun but kind of cliché
","Disney's latest animated feature is an enjoyable comic book movie based on an obscure Marvel property. The story and characters are fine but nothing particularly interesting, but it makes up for that with beautiful design and well-directed action sequences. Ryan Potter plays teenage inventor Hiro in the futuristic city that is a mixture of Tokyo and San Francisco. To make his way into his older brother's robotics program at the local college, he invents miniature, nanotechnological robots that can change shape via his own thought. Months later, after a tragic event which he thought destroyed his invention, Hiro discovers a supervillain has stolen it. With the help of his brother's medical robot Baymax (Scott Adsit) and his friends in the robotics department (T.J. Miller, Jamie Chung, Damon Wayans Jr. and Genesis Rodriguez), they use their various inventions to become superheroes to try to stop the villain. Baymax makes the film. He's so adorable and fun with his big, inflatable body. I also really loved the designs of the characters as superheroes. James Cromwell, Alan Tudyk and Maya Rudolph co-star.",7,2,23,13 November 2014
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Emotionally draining, if at times overly simplistic
","A classic 'through the eyes of childhood' story about the Holocaust. Asa Butterfield plays Bruno, a German 8 year-old whose father (David Thewlis) is the officer in charge of a concentration camp. Bruno has no clue what goes on at the camp, which he initially thinks is a farm where the weird farmers wear pajamas all the time. He sneaks up to the fence outside of the camp and meets a Jewish boy, whom he befriends. Slowly, he comes to realize that something awful is happening, and that his father is partly responsible for it. It's a great concept. It's not a great movie. I'm unsure if the fault lies with the original novel or the screenplay (by director Herman, best known for a couple of '90s indies, Little Voice and Brassed Off), but the story eschews interesting moral philosophy in favor of a more base emotionality. This is especially true in the ridiculously forced climactic sequence, with its swelling music and completely illogical cross-cutting. There's an earlier sequence in which Bruno informs on the Jewish boy in order to get out of some trouble. This should have formed the climax, similar to Louis Malle's Au Revoir les Enfants. It's impossible to deny that The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is powerful, but it should have been better.",7,2,4,23 November 2008
Brave," May not be Pixar's best, but still very good
","While this doesn't quite rank alongside Pixar's very best work, it's very good. Animation-wise, I'd say it definitely ranks high up there, and it may even be their best. I could never successfully say how much I love Princess Merida's hair, for instance. It's just gorgeous, and used so perfectly in the film. Both the landscapes and the character animations are truly awe-inspiring. The flaws are in the writing, but they hardly destroy the movie. The story is too simple, too predictable. Major plot points happen too quickly and problems are solved a bit too easily. And it is perhaps a bit too slapsticky. I think Pixar was scared they couldn't get boys in the theater with their female protagonist, so they included a lot of lowbrow comedy. However, I would say it was never that bothersome to me. For the most part, I laughed when they wanted me to laugh. And I cried when they wanted me to cry. It is an involving story, and the mother/daughter relationship which is the focus is touching. Kelly MacDonald is wonderful in the lead (loved her forever, and so glad she replaced Reese Witherspoon) and Emma Thompson matches her in the mother role. All in all, perhaps not a major work, but still very satisfying.",8,4,7,24 June 2012
The Imitation Game," A bore
","A biopic of Alan Turing, the father of modern computers. He spent WWII inventing a machine to decode the infamous Nazi Enigma machine. He was a closeted homosexual and probably had Aspergers Syndrome, as he had a very difficult time communicating to the people around him. He's played by Benedict Cumberbatch, and it's the sort of performance that wins actors awards - not to demean him, because he's very good. Keira Knightley provides a needed sense of warmth to the film as a brilliant mathematician who helps him break the code. This film was decent, but, to be frank, I was a little bored throughout a lot of it. I don't like how the script is structured (it intersperses flashbacks to his childhood and to a post-war time near his death in the mid-50s). The filmmaking is very pedestrian.",6,16,32,31 December 2014
Shrek 2," Total crap
","Only slightly less bad than the original. The story is a little better, I suppose, and it adds a couple of amusing characters. Antonio Banderas would be the highlight as Puss In Boots, but he doesn't have nearly enough screen time. My favorite character was Jennifer Saunders as the villain, the Fairy Godmother. After that, though, the movie just sucks. How many dated jokes can they fit into one movie? Let's see, we have the 'Are we there yet?' gag, which The Simpsons made old in 1990. The ripples in liquid, which was done a million times the year after Jurassic Park came out. Is it really still funny 11 years later? In the first Shrek there were Macarena jokes, long after that song was forgotten. Here, we end with Ricky Martin's 'Livin' la Vita Loca' which was old and annoying before the original film even hit the theaters. And then there's a bunch of disgusting fart and snot jokes that even cheaply produced television shows would reject as too tasteless. The abundance of C-grade pop songs makes the film even more dreadful. I mean, what happened to Counting Crows? Their first two albums were great, and now they're doing one of the cheesiest love songs I've ever heard for this piece of garbage. And, worst of all, the animation is awful! Characters move around jerkily and there's little or no attention paid to physics. Just take a look at Pixar's The Incredibles to see the difference. Seriously, if Shrek 2 beats out The Incredibles for the Oscar this year, as the original beat out the far superior Monsters Inc., I will be as sad as I was at the results of the recent presidential election. 5/10.",5,4,10,8 November 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Don't go too far in your praise: it's merely okay
","I have, for a long time, been skeptical of whether Quentin Tarantino was a worthwhile talent. Certainly Pulp Fiction was a seminal film of the 1990s, for better or worse, and Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown were at least worthwhile. But it was my burgeoning opinion that his style of goofy, self-referential filmmaking was already irrelevant, and that the cinema, even American cinema, had moved beyond anything he could accomplish. And, watching Kill Bill: Vol. 1, I realized pretty quickly that I was absolutely correct. With a new crop of young proto-auteurs that has been born since QT made Jackie Brown in 1997, Kill Bill seems awfully trite. I predicted a while back that, if Tarantino didn't make a masterpiece this time around, it would be the end of him. Well, now I think I was wrong about that. Kill Bill is far, far, far from a masterpiece, but it's not a disaster. It's somewhat mediocre, but entertaining enough that I will see its second installment (and the fact that it comes in two parts doesn't annoy me at all, in fact, as I believed it would; it ends very well), and probably the next movie Tarantino decides to make. As for the film, it's all style, no substance. I spent most of the movie wondering whether I liked it or not. And there was plenty in the film that I didn't like. The story is very poor, not compelling in the least, and the characters are dreadful. The pacing is way too slow, and the dialogue is extremely awkward at times. But the action sequences are fun, if too bloody (I'm not that big a fan of violence, to tell you the truth). I, very unfortunately, had to go to the bathroom during the longest action sequence. I don't think I will ever see this movie again, but I might just to see everything in that balletic melée. But what tipped me over from dislike into indifference was mostly the technical stuff. The costume design is fabulous, as are the cinematography and music. And the production design is some of the best I've seen, a shoo in for an Oscar nomination. Some of the editing during the fight sequences was annoying (this certainly doesn't compare to real martial arts movies, so the Shaw Brothers logo at the film's opening is a huge tease), but a lot of it was very good, too. While the shifting in time wasn't necessary, it worked well. What pushed me from indifference into approval was the animated sequence. It is the only exceptional thing in the film. It reminded me a lot of Peter Chung's work (he created Aeon Flux, which is perhaps the greatest work of animation in the last decade; this sequence seemed particularly influenced by the silent Aeon Flux cartoons from Liquid Television), but my theatergoing companions did not allow me to stick around and watch the full of the credits. I did see that it was animated in Tokyo, but any other info would be much appreciated. So, in full, Kill Bill is very worthwhile, hardly great (I'd already call it extremely overrated  some of the reviews I read last week I find a bit embarrassing), but a decent, Sunday afternoon entertainment. You might even want to wait for DVD, as you'll most likely get to see both installments as one long film (although I have doubts that it would even work as one movie, considering that this first part is nearly two hours long as it is). 7/10.",7,0,1,19 October 2003
Clash of the Titans," Really lousy
","I can't say I had high expectations for it, but, as much as I love the original, it could certainly be improved upon and I had a tiny bit of hope, since this was announced, it could be an improvement. Leterrier, his screenwriters and (maybe especially) the film's star really drop the ball. Yes, Sam Worthington proves twice in just a few months that he is a beacon of suck, just a black hole of a human being who makes everything he touches worse. Actually, I did kind of like him in Terminator Salvation, but these last two starring roles have not been kind to him. The man just has no charisma whatsoever. His Perseus comes off as a whiny bitch, and you kind of don't want to see him succeed. Harry Hamlin in the original is kind of a dull hunk, but at least he came off as a likable hero. Worthington is just a meathead whiner. Almost none of the rest of the cast registers whatsoever, except for maybe Gemma Arterton as Io, an ageless woman who accompanies the heroes on their quest (taking the place of Andromeda from the original movie, who in this one just stays home and does nothing). Arterton's main positive point, though, is her lovely face. She doesn't seem to have much of a personality. To tell the truth, the CGI monsters of the film, which, face it, was the reason anyone's going to go anyway, ain't half bad. I much prefer the original's counterparts, but this film's Graiai, giant scorpions, Medusa and Kraken are all perfectly neat (if not as impressive as the painstaking stop-motion effects of the '81 version), and I was decently excited during their sequences. But nothing else works. I didn't even mention the whole plot about the gods. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes (united for the first time since Schindler's List!) play Zeus and Hades respectively, and they are both warring against an ungrateful humanity and each other. The conflicts are not well enough written to make any real sense, or to make the audience give a crap.",4,2,5,4 April 2010
Jurassic World," Totally not bad sequel. I know it's not saying much, but it's the second best Jurassic Park movie, at least.
","I set the bar for this one pretty low. My only hope was that it would be at least as good as Jurassic Park III, which, despite its reputation, is a perfectly decent sequel to the first one. Thankfully, it exceeded my expectations - at least by a bit. It is better than JP III by a nose, and a lot better than The Lost World. All I wanted was plenty of dino mayhem, and Colin Trevorrow delivers it with good humor. There are lots of dinosaurs and lots of action. Not a single setpiece as good as the big two from the first film, mind you, but the pterosaur attack is pretty awesome and the final battle is satisfying. The human characters are much less interesting than those of the first film, who aren't very interesting, either. Chris Pratt is a fine lead, though. I could really have done without Bryce Dallas Howard running around in her high heels. Even if she does get a big heroic moment, the character is just a lame stereotype for most of the film. The two teens could have easily been eaten the second they appeared and it wouldn't have bothered me. I enjoyed the presence of New Girl's Jake Johnson and Orange Is the New Black's Lauren Lapkus in the control room. There's a moment where Johnson looks at Pratt and in my mind he was asking Pratt off camera, 'You think in a couple years when my sitcom ends I could get a comic book franchise?'",7,14,36,14 June 2015
Paranormal Activity," There were real screams in the theater
","A 'found footage' horror film along the lines of The Blair Witch Project, and the best of its type since Blair Witch. It may be even a tad better than it, though it certainly shares some of its central problems, mostly in that the characters aren't at all interesting. Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat play a couple that has recently moved in together into a large, empty house. Lately, they have been experiencing some strange phenomena, like appliances and faucets turning on by themselves and things moving around on their own. They've also woken to footsteps in the night. Katie has had similar experiences several times in her life before, and is, of course, freaked out that they seem to be starting up again after a long lull. Micah, on the other hand, is excited and comes home one day (as the film opens) with a brand new, super-expensive camera with which he hopes to capture some of the paranormal activity. He sets it up every night in their bedroom and records everything on his laptop. The couple also consults a psychic, who warns against the camera, saying that any attempts to communicate with the possible spirit might make it stronger. Sure enough, the occurrences grow more and more prominent. While the film is fairly predictable, it's great at building tension. Its stroke of genius is that, every night, the film returns to that static shot in the bedroom. It never rushes anything as we silently observe the open door to their bedroom and the darkness behind it, knowing that at some point something weird is going to happen. Every time it returns to that set-up, we know it'll get worse, and ultimately I didn't even want to open my eyes when it arrived back at night. The film is smart never to go over the top, always keeping things very small. Unfortunately, I think its own smallness is going to kill it when more people wander out to see it. Audiences wanting big reveals and in-your-face gore are going to be too dumb to appreciate something like this. I saw it with a great crowd, fortunately. Surprisingly, most of them were teenagers, but they were very respectful. As the film went on, whenever they got to the bedroom sequences the silence was audible. And this was the only movie I think I've ever seen where people actually screamed. Honest to God, there were screams! And then laughter, because it was very funny to hear that in a theater, but that was okay, too.",8,2,13,11 October 2009
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Just stick with the 1971 version
","I feel sorry for any kid who has this forced upon him or her when a near perfect version of this book already exists on film. It's not that Burton's film is totally awful. It looks nice and is occasionally amusing. However, it has little or no reason to exist. If Johnny Depp had not been allowed by Burton to make some truly awful acting decisions, the film might have been more watchable. I'm a Depp supporter, but I'll loudly say that he gives the year's worst lead performance. The kids are all pretty good, but the only one who could stand next to her 1971 counterpart would be AnnaSophia Robb as Violet Beauregarde, the gum-chewing champion who turns into a giant blueberry. I also liked the woman who played her mom. The Oompa Loompa songs are crappy, and I really missed some of the other songs from the '71 version (most notably 'I Want It Now', the original's best scene). One new sequence I did like was Willy Wonka's flashback to when he found the Oompa Loompas. Most of the rest of it is worthless.",5,2,8,9 January 2006
World Trade Center," Not as good as United 93... but still pretty good
","The second major American film depicting events of 9/11/01. It's greatest crime is that it's not as good as Paul Greengrass' United 93, which was the first. Otherwise, it's a rather good movie that would have been seen as restrained, had it not been for the utterly restrained, documentary-esquire United 93. Yes, in comparison, it does seem overly melodramatic, but it really isn't. The first 35 minutes or so are about as good as United 93. Nicholas Cage and Michael PeÃ±a star as two Port Authority police officers who are sent to the World Trade Center after the first tower has been hit by a plane. By the time they arrive, the second plane has hit, but the cops are completely unaware of what is happening. While attempting to transport equipment from WTC 5 to WTC 1 via an underground tunnel, the second tower collapses, killing many of the officers and trapping the survivors under rubble. After WTC 1 collapses, only Cage and PeÃ±a are left alive, but pinned down and unable to move. The film's major problem comes in here. Where it's easy to appreciate the horrors of these guys' situation, the film becomes inert. At this point, the focus shifts over to their suffering wives, played by Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello. The role of a cop's wife is always a pretty dull one, so you have to give credit to the two actresses for giving the characters at least some personality. And there are a couple of great parts here, too, like when Gyllenhaal has to run to the pharmacy. On the way back, her brother, who is driving, stops at a red light, and she just jumps out of the car and starts walking home. The movie still does lag during this period. One of the officers (PeÃ±a) has a vision of Christ, which I'm sure will bother some. It might have been better of Stone not to depict this literally, but I certainly don't begrudge this real person a religious vision, especially in these circumstances. The film picks up again when the two men are discovered by a couple of Marines. My only problem thereafter was a couple of references to revenge, which seems off the focus of the other themes of the picture, and a possible, though probably not purposeful, connection made between 9/11 and Iraq. The musical score, by Craig Armstrong, is surprisingly subtle for the most part (and excellent). I'm not really sure where the acidic criticism comes from. I saw more than one person claim that Oliver Stone had lost his spine on this one. What did you want him to do? Give time to the multitude of moronic conspiracy theories that exist around 9/11? Some of the conspiracy theories concerning JFK are at least somewhat believable. None of the ones surrounding 9/11 are. If Scorsese had directed this picture, the only difference would have been a lot more cutting. And he would be an even more sure thing for the Oscars. Honestly, while not at the level of United 93, World Trade Center is a worthwhile and quite a powerful movie in its own right.",8,5,11,18 December 2006
Black Snake Moan," Christina Ricci needs a burger
","Any movie where Samuel L. Jackson chains up a scantily clad Christina Ricci to his radiator to cure her of her nymphomania has to be at least worth seeing. What I didn't expect is that it would turn into a respectable drama by the end. And that's wherein the disappointment lies. It is a good movie. Christina Ricci and Sam Jackson are both excellent, the story is well written and it's different from anything else I can remember, even if it does end up endorsing the boring old status quo. The film could have been a lot more memorable if it had just stayed sleazy throughout. Still, it has its moments. The first sequence where Ricci discovers the chain around her belly is gold. You have to love Sam Jackson's titular song. And the sequence where Ricci writhes sweatily to another Jackson-belted blues number is hot as hell. Certainly worth seeing, but wait for rental.",7,5,10,12 March 2007
Prisoners," Gripping mystery
","A great mystery film. It's definitely the kind of movie that, afterward, you can pick it apart a bit and find some major narrative flaws, but, while it's going, it's so gripping and tense you're just in the moment. Hugh Jackman and wife Maria Bello take their two kids over to their neighbors' (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) house for Thanksgiving. Their two young daughters go outside to play and disappear. Detective Jake Gyllenhaal is assigned to the case and quickly finds the driver of a mysterious RV that had been seen in the neighborhood, a severely retarded man (Paul Dano). There's no evidence whatsoever that Dano did anything, but Jackman leaches onto him, refusing to believe the police in the matter. He soon kidnaps Dano and attempts to torture the truth out of him. The theme of compromised morality is powerful, and Jackman is great in this role. Gyllenhaal is also very good, although sometimes the character feels too much like a movie cop (this dude never calls for backup, even in the most dangerous situations!). The film is gorgeously shot, edited and scored.",9,1,3,29 September 2013
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," I could never hope to praise this enough: 10/10
","No matter how much I do praise it, I'll end up turning people against it. But, let me ask you: what were you expecting when you first heard of Hedwig and the Angry Inch? It's been billed as a punk rock musical about a transsexual from East Germany who was duped into coming to live in a trailer park in Kansas City. So what was I expecting? A gay camp film. I had no doubts that it would be anything else. And that's not to say that I wouldn't have enjoyed a gay camp movie. After all, I liked Moulin Rouge. But I got a surprise that was entirely unexpected: what I experienced was the best new film I had seen in years. And I mean that. Hedwig and the Angry Inch is equally hilarious and touching. Not that I want to spread cliches, but I seriously laughed and I seriously cried, often simultaneously. This manages to be the best American comedy since, damn, Preston Sturges was still writing and directing. It's easily the best movie musical since Cabaret. It's also one of the most heartfelt and passionate dramas, and one of the best character studies I've ever seen. Along with that, John Cameron Mitchell delivers a performance that perhaps hasn't been equalled since, I don't know, Robert DeNiro in Raging Bull, which might be the ultimate cinematic character study. I shouldn't say that, because it might hint that Hedwig is a dark character, but, well, I'd call her just a great protagonist. She's a heroine, especially to anyone experiencing sexual confusion, but even to me, a straight, Midwestern boy. Hedwig is a heroine for anyone who's ever felt that they've been treated like crap their entire life. I wanted to clap for and support Hedwig emotionally throughout the entire film. In short, Hedwig is a character I deeply loved, equal to just a few other characters I've met throughout my extensive journeys in the cinema. Parallel to a situation in the film, if I should ever see John Cameron Mitchell on the street, I'd have to hug him.I also have another heap of praise that I have to go through before I am done. I've always thought that movie musicals adapted from stage plays were the death of the genre. Only a few exceptions ever seemed more than unimaginative, slavish films that worked only to bring Broadway to an audience who could or would never visit NYC. Cabaret was the one big exception that I had seen previously, but you also hear West Side Story mentioned as being a great film. But, in adapting a stage play for the screen, I always expect the film to seem stranded on stage. To boot, Hedwig had another mark against it: the director, Mitchell again, had never directed a film before. Well, I really don't know what training he had in the art, but it must have been enough. The cinematic art, at least the visual aspect of it, has nearly been forgotten in the 1990s and 2000s, but John Cameron Mitchell creates a visual tour de force as much as he does one of writing and acting. I love the scene where Hedwig the adult reminisces about how his mother forced him to put his head in the oven if he wanted to sing when he was a child. And Hedwig and the Angry Inch's (that's the band's name as well as the film's) appearance outside the Menses Festival next to the port-o-potties. A goth chick, who presumably didn't have tickets for the actual Menses Festival, watches the band in deep curiosity and confusion; Hedwig invites the girl to sit up on stage with her while she relates her past. I also love the sequence where the American G.I. discovers him laying naked in rubble. Hedwig's original name was Hansel, which leads to one of the funniest jokes I can ever recall seeing. Or how about the scene where Hedwig, when babysitting, discovers Tommy, the future rock star who steals all her songs, masturbating in the bath tub? That scene is handled so well that I almost died laughing. To tell you the truth, I don't think there is anything ostensibly wrong with the film, period. I just wanted to talk about the amazing direction because the one review of it I have on hand says 'the direction can't help from being flat.' FLAT? How can you say that it is flat? PS: The animated number and the song that goes along with it is adapted from Aristophanes' speech in Plato's Symposium, about which I wrote my senior thesis in college. The rock star's stage name, Gnosis, is Ancient Greek for 'knowledge,' which Hedwig actually says in the film. One of the filmmakers must have learned Ancient Greek at some point in his life. Bravo, good sirs.",10,146,164,5 November 2001
The Dark Knight," Ledger's Joker makes this a lot better than it probably would otherwise be
","The sequel to Christopher Nolan's much ballyhooed Batman Begins, a film which frankly I disliked. It spent way too long on Batman's well-known backstory, brought in two of the worst villains from Batman's gallery of rogues, and edited together so choppily that it gave me a headache. The Dark Knight has won even better reviews and already scored a fanbase so rabid that it's hard to tolerate. No movie deserves that, of course, but we can't hold it against the film itself. No, it's nowhere near good enough to be called the best movie ever made. It's nowhere near the best movie released so far in 2008. It is, however, a marked improvement over Batman Begins, even while having some of the same flaws. Its editing is frequently poor, too. It has improved somewhat, but there were still some action sequences, most notably Batman's first appearance, that were difficult to follow.The biggest hole in the movie, in fact in every Batman movie so far, is Batman himself. I can't offer any advice myself on how to fix the problem, but Batman/Bruce Wayne is the dullest character. They try to inject some substance with Wayne's struggles with his own vigilantism and the way in which he keeps the cycle of criminality in revolution, but, in my opinion, it's rarely interesting. Christian Bale is a mediocre actor, and he brings nothing to the table. And the deep voice he uses as Batman is extremely grating and ridiculous. Add to that that the costume design of the current Batman makes him look like a linebacker. He just doesn't seem streamlined enough to be able to pull off any complicated martial arts moves.Of course, as you've no doubt heard, all eyes watching The Dark Knight are looking at Heath Ledger, who plays the Joker. The Joker is easily the best of Batman's villains, and Ledger has created the definitive Joker in this movie. I hate to say it, but Jack Nicholson's performance in Tim Burton's Batman is bound to be forgotten. The script overall is quite good, despite a clunky scene or two. It creates a fuller view of Gotham City and its strata of criminals and official corruption. And I love how it fits the Joker into this all, an 'engine of chaos', as he describes himself, wanting to upset the good guys and the bad guys alike until nothing is left but total anarchy. The Dark Knight veers into the horror genre at times, and does so effectively. As for the rest of the cast, Aaron Eckhart is quite good as Harvey Dent. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are both as good as they were in the first film, in which I thought they gave by far the best performances. Maggie Gyllenhaal replaces Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes, but unfortunately she doesn't improve this already undercooked role. Nolan's direction is fine, but I still think he's far better suited to the mystery puzzle films he's done besides the Batman flicks. I think any moderately good director could have made it.",8,10,25,20 July 2008
The Greatest Game Ever Played," One of the better American films to be released in 2005
","I hate sports movies, but I found this one exceptionally well done. Kudos to Bill Paxton on his sophomore effort and his second good film, after the flawed but unforgettable Frailty. The Greatest Game Ever Played doesn't offer any surprises plotwise, but the level of acting and the depth that Paxton finds in the material certainly is surprising. Shia LaBeouf plays a working-class young man who is great at golf, and ends up playing against, and doing well against pros in the US Open. The film uses the class issues that come with the game of golf to add a lot of nuance. Paxton's direction and the editing during the Open (which lasts most of the movie) are excellent, and it is certainly one of the most gripping sports movies I've ever seen. LaBeouf is exceptional, as are many of the supporting performances. The performance that's getting all the press for the film is from Josh Flitter, a 10 year-old who plays LaBeouf's caddy. Yeah, he's cute and funny, and the energy he adds is probably needed for a lot of the audience. But, to me, he seemed pretty obviously there just to be cute, and just to keep a segment of the audience from getting bored. If not for the utterly cliché and pointless my-father-doesn't-approve-of-me subplot, this film would be one of the best of the year. As it is, if it had had a little more press, it would have been a sure-shot for the Seabiscuit slot in the Best Picture category.",8,2,8,30 October 2005
2001: A Space Odyssey," By Light Years the Best Film Ever Made
","2001 warps beyond every other film ever made. I have seen it nearly a dozen times since I first saw it in 1997. I bought it right away on VHS, and when I got DVD, it was the only VHS tape I replaced with a DVD.
So why is it the best film ever made? Simply because it transcends narrative. No other film has really done that. Even surrealist films are rooted in narrative. Avant-guarde films sometimes do not use narrative, but they become only moving paintings. 2001 has narrative, but it never insists on it. It lovingly displays the amazing visuals. The narrative itself makes me feel that humanity could be so much more. Kubrick usually is kind of pessimistic, but at the end of 2001, he shows Dave's transcendence. And he is moving towards Earth to bring the rest of humanity with him. Although it shows the state of humanity as it exists now as violent and unsympathetic to the plight of others, it shows hope for our future. I have a rather large complaint about how some people look at this film, though. The introductory comment to this film on this site mentions understanding it more since that person has read the novel. This is all misinformation! Kubrick was inspired by the Clarke short story 'The Sentinal,' which I have read. It is not really worth it. If you've ever seen Clarke on The Discovery Channel's 'Mysteries of the Unknown' or whatever it's called, you know how pompous he is. The visions in 2001 are completely Kubrick's. Arthur C. Clarke was just a trampoline off which he jumped. The novel is not an original. It was written alongside with the film, and it was published afterwards. The university at Champaigne-Urbana celebrated Hal's birth in 1996, the date it gave in the novel. It is 1992 in the film, of course. Those ungrateful losers. That is the difference between a technology nerd and a cineast. Then Clarke completely milked the greatness of this film to make a living. If you want to see how terrible he really is, see the sequel to 2001, 2010, which he wrote. It was so awful that I killed it after 20 minutes. Pay no attention to Clarke and his leech-like behavior to this masterpiece.Those complaints, of course, have nothing to do with the actual film. To me, it is the most inspirational film ever made. I would watch it over anything. infinite/10",10,7,14,6 April 2000
Singin' in the Rain," I love this film, but...
","I think the dance numbers, and even some of the songs, are less amazing than those of its immediate predecessor, An American in Paris, made by gene Kelly a year beforehand. I know that the An American in Paris songs were just adaptations of Gershwin songs, but they're great, and they work. That rendition of 'I Got Music' is wonderful, and the 20 minute ballet at the end is one of the greatest things I've ever seen in a film. There are several songs from Singing in the Rain which were a little weak, and the 'New York Ballet' doesn't feel right at all in this film. It's obviously a grab for the success of An American in Paris and its amazing finale. That one made a lot of sense in that film (and was itself inspired by the even more amazing ballet sequence from The Red Shoes). That ballet sequence had much more substance, and didn't seem excessive. The New York Ballet did seem a bit excessive, although nice to watch.What puts Singing in the Rain above An American in Paris is its plot. An American in Paris' plot was almost completely filler material between the songs and dance. The ending to that film (after the ballet sequence, that is) was very abrupt and didn't even make much sense. Singing in the Rain is extremely interesting in its setting. It's very interesting from a historical perspective, and that's what pushes it to a 10/10 for me, 1 above An American in Paris.",10,2,5,14 June 2000
Puss in Boots," About as bad as any of the Shrek movies
","A spin-off of the Shrek series starring Antonio Banderas' character, Puss in Boots. Puss in Boots was the best character in any of those movies (thank the Lord we didn't get a Donkey movie!), but that's damning with faint praise. This film isn't noticeably better than any of the Shreks. The writers of these films couldn't come up with a decent joke if their lives depended on it. All they've got up their sleeves is having the heroic, swashbuckling Puss act like a real cat every once in a while. Really, that's about as clever as it ever gets. They even brought in Salma Hayek as the love interest. The least they could do was reference Desperado. It'd be a cheap gag, but the film is so dry I'd have taken it. They also have Zach Galafianakis as Humpty Dumpty, Puss's former partner with whom he teams back up. And, again, they have nothing for him to do. Why hire a well-known comedian to play this character? Literally anyone could have voiced him (you can't even recognize Galafianakis), but instead they threw away a bunch of cash. Burning it would have at least kept them warm for a few seconds. The animation is as ugly as it ever was in the Shrek movies. The human characters, in particular, have always been beyond hideous. Humpty Dumpty also looks terrible. The action sequences, however, aren't too bad. They've improved that aspect of the animation quite a bit since the last Shrek movie I saw.",5,2,6,26 February 2012
This Is Spinal Tap," Deserves its fame
","Spinal Tap has been called one of the funniest movies ever made by many people over the years. I had always been familiar with it. I was very familiar with almost 70% of the scenes: the amplifier that goes to 11, the Stonehenge dance, the inability to find the way onstage in Cleveland. Plus, when it was first released on VHS, I had rented and loved Fear of a Black Hat, a mockumentary about a rap group which more or less rips off every scene of This Is Spinal Tap. After finally sitting down with This Is Spinal Tap, I am still a fan of Fear of a Black Hat (and I recommend it to anyone who hasn't heard of it), but it can not come close to touching the genius of the collective vision of Rob Reiner, Christopher Guest, Micheal McKean and Harry Shearer. I laughed pretty much constantly, and belly laughs, all through the film. It does kind of slow down nearer the end with the bands falling apart (i.e., the plot gets in the way of the documentary), but there was never a scene in the film that didn't have something hilarious. I have to give this film 10/10. This Is Spinal Tarp, er, um, I mean Tap is one of the funniest comedies ever made.",10,91,116,31 July 2000
The Mummy Returns," Unpretentious and fun. 7/10
","The Mummy Returns is maybe a step above the first one. The action is non-stop, and it does manage, for the most part, to rouse the audience, or at least me. The good guys are likable. Brendan Fraser is where he belongs. Rachel Weisz is beautiful. John Hannah amuses as Jonathan, and Freddie Boath manages not to annoy as Alex, the kid. He's pretty good as a smart-mouthed brat. The bad guys are, for the most part, fun to hate. Im-Ho-Tep is a good villain. Maybe he isn't given enough to do here, but he's still cool. Patricia Valazquez is a real stunner as his love interst, Anck-Su-Namun. She's probably the best thing about the film. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje was good as Lock Nah, the main henchman. Perhaps the weakest part of the film is the Rock as the Scorpion King. The narration during the film's prologue is not nearly as good as it would be if we were watching the story develop. The Scorpion King is basically a boring character. His computer-animated doppleganger at the film's climax is neat, but it would have been better if there were some feelings towards that character.People who know their action flicks will notice that the Mummy Returns steals about every action scene from every action movie made in the past 20 years, quoting movies like Aliens, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park 2 (why? that movie was terrible), and especially Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, with which, if you remember, The Mummy I was competing with in the box office successfully in May of 1999. They don't try to hide any of it. They even make a jest at Spielberg with a shadow against the moon from ET and Amblin Entertainment. It's all in good fun. You shouldn't be too angry at the sloppy script. If you are going to be angry, the shoddy computer animation should be your target. Still, it's not bad.",7,60,88,4 May 2001
Avatar," Even if it is sporadically decent or fun, it's mostly a bore
","A crashing bore. There is almost no real reason to see this film. As you could probably tell from the previews or other plot descriptions, it is a virtual remake of Dances with Wolves, but starring elongated, CGI, blue aliens. Yet even that movie wasn't nearly as patronizing with its noble savage bullcrap. I am not exaggerating when I say I have almost never seen a less imaginative movie. But what about the visuals, you say? Well, they are pretty, and the CGI is better than it has ever been in the past. But I'd say it isn't even close to a huge step forward. A pretty tiny step, really, from The Lord of the Rings' Gollum. The (motion captured) faces look more expressive than Gollum's. But they still have far to go before the CGI creations look 'photo-realistic', as the idiotic Cameron likes to describe his cartoon characters and settings. And they still haven't worked out just how to move CGI characters - they still don't look like they exist in any kind of real world outside of a computer hard drive. But I guess by now I have to accept filmmakers are always going to rely on CGI, and it's always going to look like a cartoon. I have to say, I did mostly enjoy it when Cameron was introducing new jungle creatures (I think the final tally is about nine different species of animals that live on the planet), but both the flora and the fauna are reminiscent of black light posters and prog-rock album covers (I'll credit Jim Emerson for tipping me toward that, but I knew even in the previews that everything looked a little too familiar). And the N'avi? They're Native Americans. Cameron's allegory is easily the thinnest I've ever seen in a major motion picture. Some critics have argued about how it allegorically relates to current American military woes, but, frankly, if Cameron intended any of it, he screws it up royally by making the N'avi 100% justified in whatever they do. It's every bit as black and white as anything George W. Bush ever said. I'm sure he loves the Hell out of this film. And, even if I tried to just shut off my brain (pretty impossible), so much of the ride is uneventful. If not for the film's final half hour, which is comprised of the big battle, I'd probably call this the worst film of the year. As it is, I'd probably rather sit through Transformers 2 again. At least I can marvel at the audaciousness of Michael Bay's tastelessness. It's better than Cameron's utter blandness.",5,60,106,28 December 2009
Toy Story 2," I'm impressed
","The original Toy Story was a pretty good animated film, especially good for kids. It was inventive and consistently entertaining, but for some reason, it never quite gelled. I'm beside myself trying to explain what was lacking. I don't know. At the end, I just went about my day without thinking about it much. And I wasn't all that excited about Toy Story 2. I had heard that it was better than the original, but I was skeptical. Well, I finally got around to watching it, and it blew me away. It was extraordinarily good. I have hardly ever laughed as hard. It also has an amazingly intelligent script. Its only problems are a little hyperactivity, which all American animated films are guilty of (if you don't know what I'm talking about, rent Kiki's Delivery Service or My Neighbor Totoro, both children's movies from Japan, and you'll notice how much more relaxed they are), and one TERRIBLE song. Oh my God, it is sickeningly sappy. Otherwise, a nearly perfect film. 9/10",9,0,2,1 January 2001
Drag Me to Hell," Too predictable and far too loud
","A huge disappointment in my eyes, especially after the high praise it has received from critics. Sam Raimi attempts to return to his B movie roots. Like the Evil Dead movies, it's delightfully cheesy and relentless. Unfortunately, it's also very formulaic and, much of the time, downright obnoxious. This is one film I would almost implore people not to see in theaters. At least not ones that like to turn the volume up. This movie is LOUD. I saw Terminator Salvation at the same theater, and was not nearly as deafened as I was by Drag Me to Hell. The problem: horror stings on the soundtrack. CONSTANTLY. The formula of the film is this: quiet set-up followed by sharp screech and an even louder BOO! It's the same thing over and over. I was cowering, but only because I was afraid I might not be able to hear in the morning. The story isn't bad, but it's been done before. Alison Lohman (awful) plays a loan officer who gets cursed by a gypsy after she turns her down for a loan extension. A goat demon begins to attack Lohman and, well, the rest of its intentions are included in the title of the film. Though I generally didn't like it, it's far from a bad film. In fact, I think it might play better on television (it's definitely the kind of movie that I would have caught on late night TV as a kid and loved). The séance scene near the end of the film is mostly gold. The demon itself is scary as Hell, but Raimi's way of indicating it, with sharp screeches, is what ruined the movie for me.",6,35,78,31 May 2009
Grindhouse," Hard to beat for best film of '07
","It would be hard to defend this nostalgic double-feature film as a masterpiece, but I can, without any guilt, say that it was one of the greatest experiences I've ever had at the theater. It's not just a movie; it can legitimately be called an experience. Rodriguez's segment, Planet Terror, is probably the more easily enjoyed and more consistently enjoyable of the films. Kind of a rip-off of Romero's Dead series, but that makes perfect sense as it's supposed to be a cheap fright flick. And what easier way to make a cheap fright flick than to rip off a good one? Planet Terror feels exactly like what it is supposed to be, with its disgusting gore, lame jokes and Godawful acting (star Freddy Rodriguez, the segment's male lead, excels at this so well it's downright spooky). And, what's better, it rarely seems to be winking at the audience when it's doing these things. It's an all-out ball. Tarantino's segment, Death Proof, is a more confounding animal. After Planet Terror, any movie might seem a little slow. But Death Proof really is a slow burn. It starts off with a very 70s-ish feel, with outdated hairstyles and bad acting that feels like it comes from bad movies of that era. But then, about halfway through, it changes tones entirely and becomes a very modern-feeling movie, with mostly pretty good performances. The dialogue throughout is very much in the Tarantino vein, and let us not forget that it was his dialogue that made him famous. The structure of the film kind of seemed nouvelle vague-esquire, and of course Tarantino was a big fan of that movement. When Death Proof gets to its climax, though, it's pure adrenaline rush. The film references (aloud) Dirty Marry Crazy Larry, Vanishing Point and Gone in 60 Seconds, and then ends with one of the most entertaining car chases in cinema history. However disjointed Death Proof feels, it's still a damn fun movie. And the two halves of Grindhouse might not comment on each other much (they do briefly share the same universe, in one weird sequence), but the entire thing just rocks. Add to that several fake trailers for other cheesy movies (my favorite being the first one, Machete, of which a feature length version is supposedly already in production), and you've really got yourself some cinematic gold. It'll be a shame when Harvey 'Scissorhands' Weinstein cuts it in two in a short while here, because it's all about the entire experience. Right now it's the film to beat for '07.",10,1,6,16 April 2007
The Artist," Quite enjoyable!
","A highly enjoyable little throwback to the silent film era. It's more or less a slightly altered version of Singin' in the Rain. Its male star, Jean Dujardin, is even a dead ringer for Gene Kelly (and, in a far too brief role, the wonderful character actress Missi Pyle also makes a great stand-in for Jean Hagen). Dujardin plays the great silent film star George Valentin, a Douglas Fairbanks type who makes swashbucklers and spy films, is always aided by his trusty dog (played by Uggie, but strangely never named in the film), and always wins the girl. One day he meets up with an attractive extra, Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo), who meets his fancy. Unfortunately, he's married, so that romance has to die before it even starts. The film opens in 1927 - a couple of years go by and Valentin is being pushed out by the advent of sound, while Peppy is becoming a major star. The story isn't anything really special, honestly, and the silent filmmaking, while it is well done, is nothing more than a gimmick. The film might not work at all if it weren't for Dujardin and Bejo, both of whom are just charming as all get-out. Bejo in particular is just one of the most gorgeous starlets ever - it was really surprising to find out she's been toiling away in the industry for over a decade now (she co-starred in A Knight's Tale, with Heath Ledger, in 2001). It takes a while to get over Dujardin's resemblance to Gene Kelly (I have to imagine director Michel Hazanavicius, who made the two French spy spoofs in the OSS 117 series with Dujardin, came up with the idea by wondering what it would be like to remake Singin' in the Rain with the star), but I did eventually. I was enjoying the film so much I have to admit I didn't even notice the use of Bernard Herrmann's Vertigo theme.",8,1,4,22 January 2012
Mama," Some minor flaws, but this is often terrifying
","Quite good mainstream horror flick. There are plenty of flaws, and it has the tendency to go too big at times. At its best, though, it's absolutely terrifying, easily the scariest movie I've seen so far this month. Its greatest assets are the two little girls who star in it, Megan Charpentier and (particularly) Isabelle Nelisse. They're both awesome, and, man, Nelisse really nails the creepy little kid thing about as well as anyone ever has. Jessica Chastain and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau star (though Coaster-Waldau, so awesome in Game of Thrones, might as well not have, since he's sidelined for 90% of the picture for no good reason; why even waste the money?) as a couple who adopt Coaster-Waldau's two nieces, who have been lost in the forest for five years. They were supposedly alone, though they claim they were taken care of by someone (or something) they call Mama (spoiler: ). The film wisely keeps Mama offscreen for most of the movie, only giving you hints. When it does reveal her in more detail, well, it's damned scary. It's CGI, which I usually hate, but it's still freaky.",8,0,1,21 October 2013
Super 8," Derivative, but still really good
","J.J. Abrams aims to make an homage to Spielberg (who co-produced) in this summer blockbuster. The homaging is pretty rampant, and you'll catch references not just to Spileberg's films (mostly Close Encounters, E.T. and The Goonies, which he produced), but to Carpenter's The Thing, Romero's The Crazies and Night of the Living Dead, Bong's The Host and Abrams' own Cloverfield (which he produced and co-wrote). All of this can make the film, at times, seem derivative, but, amazingly, it mostly works. The reason is the cast. The protagonists are a group of kids who are making a film. Newcomer Joel Courtney is the son of a local deputy (Kyle Chandler). Elle Fanning is the slightly older girl who is newly joining the group as the film's star (of course, she becomes Chandler's love interest). The other kids are played by Riley Griffiths, Gabriel Basso, Zach Mills and Ryan Lee (particularly memorable as the kid obsessed with explosives). While they're filming their zombie movie, they witness a horrific train derailment that releases something mysterious into their small Ohio town. The air force (led by Noah Emmerich) arrives shortly thereafter to investigate the weird goings-on which are disrupting the town. The film is nothing original, but those kids are so wonderful they make the film thoroughly enjoyable. Abrams also knows how to build a set-piece, although, occasionally, he goes over the top. The film is funny when it needs to be, and it can be very scary at times, too. This is certainly a very enjoyable time at the movies.",8,1,10,12 June 2011
Sinister," Too many cheap scares harm what is otherwise a very good horror film
","Ethan Hawke stars as a true crime writer who moves with his family into the house where a grisly murder occurred a short while ago. He immediately discovers a box of home movies in his attic (which appear to have been placed there after the police investigation) which show the murder. And not only that one, but several other murders from years past which seem to be connected. As Hawke explores the movies further, strange things begin happening in the house. This is most certainly a scary movie. I was honestly in constant terror all through it. Yet, I have to admit, I didn't really love it. I had a lot of problems. The whole situation is freaky, so why does the director (who previously made the awful Exorcism of Emily Rose) feel the need to scream at us to get us to jump? One also has to question Hawke's actions through much of the film. An antagonism with the local police is set up in the first sequence, but it never makes any real sense. Hawke never seems to be the kind of guy who would obstruct justice for his book, and, really, even if he did give new information to the police (and he absolutely would have called them immediately when he discovered what was in the box), how would that effect his book adversely? Not that it really matters, because the horror is revealed to be supernatural anyway, but it just seems like a pointless obstruction to set up. So, in short, effective, but I'm not exactly happy HOW it is effective.",7,0,1,15 October 2012
Up," Ah, Pixar. What I wait for all year long.
","And they don't disappoint at all with this outing. It's probably not their best work. That's Wall-E. It's not as tightly plotted as other Pixar flicks, and the villain, in particular, could have used more work. But so what? Really, I haven't enjoyed a movie this much since, well, Wall-E. The prologue of this film, especially its second sequence, a completely silent (except for score) exploration of a long, beautiful marriage that gives us a novel's worth of information in a mere 8 minutes, is so remarkable that I could not hold back tears. In a way, that's a minor flaw as well. The film never quite tops those first 10 or 15 minutes. But the remaining 70 or 80 minutes are a ton of fun, and touching in their own way. Pixar shows Disney that cute animal sidekicks can be completely charming and hilarious. Dug the dog who talks with his special collar is constantly hilarious, as is the goofy bird, nicknamed Kevin. Like I said already, the villain is weak and could have been more thoroughly characterized. But it's not too bad - that's made up for with his more villainous talking dogs. Villainous they certainly are, but the way they talk, still thinking like dogs, is always worth some big laughs. And there's also a cute kid who is in no way annoying. Pixar proves once again that it has more imagination, wit and charm than anyone else working in the medium today. And that medium is not animated features, but cinema itself.",10,2,5,31 May 2009
From Hell," Truly effective Gothic horror film
","I wasn't expecting much from this movie. The critics passed it over rather quickly, saying a few kind words but without a strong recommendation. The couple of people I knew who saw this said that it was 'good,' but never cared to say much more than that and have never brought it up again. As I sat down to watch it, I thought it looked nice but moved too fast, was a little dumb. But by the end, I was astounded. I think it's one of the best films of 2001. Sure, it's a triumph of style over substance, but I think we need a couple of good films like this every year. I love style.I would compare From Hell most closely to Alex Proyas' 1997 triumph Dark City, which, like From Hell, made almost nothing at the box office. I hope, like Dark City, that From Hell will win a larger audience on video. It's not as intelligent as Dark City, which was brilliant in nearly every way, but From Hell equals it in visual virtuosity. Its story, while sometimes lapsing into silliness, is enormously gripping. It's also one of the few horror films to succeed at inducing a sense of dread in the audience. A Scotland Yard detective (played well by Johnny Depp) is on the case of Jack the Ripper, who is himself on the trail of a group of five prostitutes. On the way, Depp discovers that the ritualistic murders are part of a larger conspiracy. The film is full of great twists, the biggest one being simply hilarious in its level of audacity. The end is quite unpredictable (although the climax is a little too predictable).There are several minor flaws in the film. It does go a bit too fast, but its breathless pace ends up paying off well in the end. Many people will be turned off at the level of gore in the film. Seriously, avoid it at all costs if you have a weak stomach. But if you could take it in Silence of the Lambs, Se7en, or Sleepy Hollow, you'll be fine. I actually felt that those three particular films flaunted their gore and were tremendously ineffective in their horror. Yes, even (and perhaps especially) Silence of the Lambs. I don't know why, but I didn't feel that way about From Hell. 10/10.",10,61,88,20 March 2002
National Treasure," Incredibly stupid, but, I have to admit, I enjoyed it
","For a movie that's pretty much just a cheap combination of Indiana Jones and The Da Vinci Code, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed National Treasure. Oh, it's dumb, but it's dumb fun. Nicolas Cage stars as the latest descendant of the Gates family, whose members have spent their existence following the treasure of the Knights Templar. The Freemasons, descended from the Knights Templar, have supposedly left a series of clues leading to this treasure. Cage, in his hammy mode, carries the movie. His sidekicks, Diane Kruger and Justin Bartha, are mostly boring, as are the villains (led by Sean Bean). Harvey Keitel and Jon Voight pop up in supporting roles, but neither of them adds too much. It really is the Nicolas Cage show. It moves quick and doesn't allow you to overthink any of the extremely simple story. I'd definitely place this in the 'guilty pleasure' column, but a pleasure it is.",7,1,1,1 June 2008
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," Powerful stuff
","Last year's Palm D'Or winner. It was kind of a surprise winner, and opinions have been all over it. I haven't seen a lot of the official selections, but of the few I've seen, it's the second best after Almodóvar's Volver (one of my favorites of last year). It's the story of two brothers, Teddy and Damien (Pádraic Delaney and Cillian Murphy), who join the Irish Republican Army after witnessing several atrocities committed by occupying British soldiers. The IRA is basically an insurgent group, which will probably remind most audience members of Iraq. Perhaps this was Loach's intention, and perhaps this is even why the film took home the Palm D'Or. But, allegorically, it doesn't fit the Iraq situation particularly well. Neither the occupying force nor the rebel force of this story matches up very well with present-day Iraq. Plus, the film ends after the occupying force has left. The last third of the film occurs after the Irish parliament has signed a very compromising treaty, wherein they gain a sort of freedom, but are still considered a part of the United Kingdom. If they refused to sign, there would certainly have been war. The people are divided on this, and they begin to fight amongst themselves, including the two brothers. Really, this is a powerful film about the toil, the sacrifices and the stupidity of war. It kind of reminds me of Melleville's Army of Shadows, and even in a way of The Godfather. It contains several gut-wrenching sequences, well directed by Loach (this is my first film by him, for what it's worth). Reviewers who want to comment on the politics of the film are pretty much ignoring that last and most crucial part of this film. The film is solely about the Irish, not the British. In all honesty, though many of the British soldiers we see are brutal louts, I don't see them behaving at all unbelievably for who they are, especially considering the situation (the film does kind of plop us down in the middle of the argument without giving us much context, it is true). Some of them aren't depicted this way, and most are depicted as faceless fodder. Which is exactly how the protagonists see them  or are supposed to see them, anyway  and that's what's most important. There certainly is sympathy for the British victims, as when, after a raid that leaves a couple dozen British dead, a few of the inexperienced IRA men can't stop staring at the corpses they've just created. 'Don't look at them. They'd have done the same to you,' is the order that's barked at them. I'm glad I skipped it at the theater, though. I was worried about not being able to understand the dialect, and, sure enough, I had to use subtitles. Highly recommended.",9,2,9,17 September 2007
How to Train Your Dragon," Despite the predictable storyline, this is hugely enjoyable
","Like all of Dreamworks' animated films, you can pretty much predict every moment of How to Train Your Dragon from the film's opening sequence. In particular, the whole relationship between the father and son in this picture is so banal I had to roll my eyes every time the father character (voiced by Gerard Butler - for some reason, the major adult vikings in the movie all have Scottish accents) appeared on screen. So I have to admit that I enjoyed this movie a heck of a lot. And even after several days, my happiness with it has not diminished. I think most of that has to do with the relationship between the protagonist, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), and the dragon, Toothless. What can I say, I'm a sucker for any story about a person's relationship with their pet, and with the dragon so cat-like, the film was pretty much irresistible. The dragons are all fantastic, and the film truly comes alive whenever any of them (and especially when Toothless) is on screen. But, really, Dreamworks has never done better with their film-making. They've created a nice little world here. It has a texture and a beauty not before seen in Dreamworks animated features (though still a good deal below Pixar's last two films). Their last few films have had really well done action sequences, and Dragons keeps up with that quite nicely, putting the similar dragon flying sequences in Avatar to shame. DeBlois and Sanders previously directed Disney's Lilo & Stitch (pretty obvious when you compare Toothless's design to Stitch's), which has a similar charm.",8,2,6,18 April 2010
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," For what it's worth, it fully lives up to its reputation
","If you're curious about Salo, and can stand anything, no matter how depraved, then go for it. I think it wins the award for the most profane and pornographic film ever made, beating the hell out of its closest competitors like The Night Porter or In the Realm of the Senses. However, I think Salo is a better film than those two. Pasolini actually has some sense of artistry, and, if you can stand it, Salo is actually a very well made film. It's agenda is nothing but a front - yes, we already know that fascism is bad. No, this film reveals much more about its own creator than anything else. It's a playground for his fantasies. But I believe he must have known that. The plot proceeds very logically and the suspense and horror grow exponentially. Pasolini knew that he who had free reign would end up going too far. The final act is as brilliant as it is stomach-churning, and it's no coincidence that the President and many of his top-ranking men only watch it indoors with binoculars. I think this wins the contest for the best movie that you can hardly bring yourself to watch. 9/10.",9,5,10,17 December 2001
Total Recall," Great premise reduced to a pretty good action flick. 7/10
","When I first saw Total Recall, only a bit over a year ago, I thought it was a fun action flick and nothing more. I remember being a bit disappointed at it. The scene where Edgecomb enters Quaid's hotel room and tells him that he is trapped in his own mind made me think how much better the film could have been if the writers had tried to make the audience think that maybe the whole movie (after Quaid visits Rekall) was just an accident in the memory implant. Well, after watching the film twice in one week, I have discovered some things. The writers did try to make the film ambiguous. There are two huge clues to this fact right before Quaid is knocked out in the Rekall lab: 1. the picture on the screen is obviously Melina. 2. One of the technicians says, right before Quaid falls asleep: 'Blue skies on Mars. That's new.' (the second chapter to the end of the DVD is titled 'Blue Skies on Mars).So there we are. The story is ambiguous. Or is it? Very few people have even noticed this. I'm sure there are plenty of fans of the film who would violently argue that most of the film takes place in Quaid's head. These people should take the next step. There are huge problems with the last two acts of the film if it is just a dream. The biggest problem, the one which makes the whole dream theory fall utterly apart, is that at least a third of the scenes after Quaid is sedated take place without him on screen. One cannot dream without being present at the events which are unfolding.I also think the writers were confused about the whole backstory. Hauser, is he supposed to be a good guy or a bad guy? Most people will pick up that we're supposed to think he is a good guy at the beginning, then near the end of the film he is revealed to have been involved in the whole plot against Kuato. It seemed like a really good plot twist the first time I saw it, and it felt like a kick in the stomach. The last time I watched it though, there is an interesting scene where Richter and Cohegan talk. Cohegan seems very frightened that Quaid might reveal the secrets he has found. He then tells Richter that he has a plan to capture him, and says, 'I have a plan, if you're willing to play along.' The plan he is talking about has to be the creation of Hauser as a bad guy who was only turned to Quaid so he could infiltrate the mutant rebellion. We can also see that Hauser was a rebel sympathizer earlier when Richter complains to his companions (not to Quaid), 'We should have killed Quaid on Mars.' Why would he say this unless Hauser had actually been an enemy before? If one thinks this back story out, it makes no sense whatsoever (notice that Benny infiltrated the mutant headquarters without any complex plot, thus they didn't really need Hauser to get to Kuato). Cohegan could have easily created a video with a fake Hauser (just as Quaid appeared as a fake fat woman). He could have easily implanted a fake memory in Quaid to make him believe that he had always been Hauser. The writers must have been confusing each other, though, because it seems that near the end they completely forgot that Hauser's evil persona was false. Cohegan persists in saying that he wants the old Hauser back. This makes no sense with what has come before.The consensus: great premise that failed because of the screenwriters. It turns out to be just a fun action movie. The only thing the film did completely right: the Tri-Breasted Hooker and the Midget Hooker. I think they should get their own television series.",8,1,6,11 December 1999
Limitless," Insanely stupid
","Truly putrid thriller starring the 'sexiest man alive' Bradley Cooper. The dude can't act worth a crap, but even if he could, he couldn't save the film from such an enormously stupid screenplay. It's about a dunderhead (Cooper) who is given a magic clear pill by his ex-brother-in-law that allows him to use his full brain capacity. The pill makes him so smart that he's able to play the stock market and get rich quick - of course, he's so smart that the way he gets funding to play the stock market is by borrowing from the Russian mafia. Because that's what smart people would do. Later in the film, Cooper's girlfriend (Abbie Cornish, whose career should be going much better than it is - she stars in two of the worst films of the year, this and Sucker Punch) takes the pill and decides to use an eight year old girl with ice skates as a weapon. The thing is, the writers of this film (and the original novel; this was based on a friggin' novel!) are so dumb they don't have any clue how a smart person would think, so they just come up with whatever is in their dumbass heads and put it in the movie. Co-starring Rober De Niro.",3,3,7,4 December 2011
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick's Second best after 2001
","I think the critics, even the ones who like this film, are missing the point. When 2001 came out, most every critic panned it completely. Pauline Kael, the uber-critic, called it dull and unimaginative. At that time, I can understand her view. Kubrick's famous films that far were The Killing, Paths of Glory, Spartacus, Lolita (the only one on this list I haven't seen), and Dr. Strangelove. All of these are wonderful films, Dr. Strangelove usually being considered his second masterpiece after 2001, but they lack the style of all the later Kubrick films. 2001 may be somewhat tedious to the average person once in a while, and it's almost uninterpretable, but it leaves posibly the strongest after-thoughts of any film. Kubrick's target was our love for narrative, but our unconscious minds. The pleasure of watching 2001 and Kubrick's other later films resides deep inside. It is too bad critics only have a few days to write their reviews. But by this time, they should have seen enough of Kubrick's films to realize this. The Shining, A Clockwork Orange, and Full Metal jacket all aged beautifully in my perception, and they all get better with each subsequent viewing. No other director who ever lived can do this.Only 2001 effects the unconscious mind more than Eyes Wide Shut. It is truly his second best film. It's images wander in my mind two days afterward as if I saw it an hour ago. I lay in bed the whole first night thinking about it, not sleeping for ten minutes. I didn't need to go to sleep to dream that night. The film seemed as if I dreamed it. The grainy film really added to that effect. And the color scheme. God, Kubrick was a genius to set this film at Christmastime. There are several gorgeous shots of Christmas lights. And a neon rainbow that especially lingers in my mind. And the religious orgy scene, which will undoubtedly become the most famous scene in the film, has colors that just made me weep with their heavenly beauty. Oh, and those purple sheets at the very end of the film. Critics complained about a speech near the end that undermined and ruined a nice murder mystery thread of the narrative (see especially Roger Ebert's review; though I love him, I think he's dead wrong this time). I think it would have been below Kubrick to end the film with a mysterious twist. Any director can give us a narrative trick at the end to put a goofy smile on our face. The idiotic ending of The Usual Suspects comes to the head of my mind. It's usually misinterpreted as genius because people don't realize that the sum of the parts ought to naturally be greater than one clever scene. If you want to see real genius, see Eyes Wide Shut, the second best film that Kubrick made, the second best film of the nineteen-nineties, and one of the best films ever made.",10,7,13,18 July 1999
Sicario," Fantastic suspense
","A tale of the dirty, dirty drug war taking place between the border of Mexico and the US. Emily Blunt plays the audience surrogate, an FBI agent who, after stumbling upon a horrifying scene of cartel violence in suburban Phoenix, is recruited by a mysterious, obviously important government figure (Josh Brolin) to help him get the top people who are really responsible for the crime, which is just one of many similar crimes that are encroaching further and further into 'civilized' territories. Even if you end up finding the story a little too vague (I didn't, but I could easily imagine someone thinking that), you have to admit it's one of the most suspenseful films to come out in quite some time. The whole entrance into and exit from Juarez near the beginning of the film is a master class in creating anxiety. It's more terrifying than the vast majority of horror films. And that's just one sequence among several great set pieces. I do have some slight problems/questions about how Blunt fits into the whole picture. In the end, I'm not sure it makes a whole lot of sense. I also think she comes off as a tad too naive. She's an FBI agent, not a small town police officer. I like her performance, but it may be a little too one-note to qualify as great. She is understandably in shock for most of the film, and the script has to resort to the old 'I picked the wrong week to quit smoking!' shtick to have her emote. The best performance by far comes from Benicio del Toro, who plays Brolin's 'advisor' who clearly has way more going on behind his shadowy mien. Any flaws are minor, though, and could perhaps be cleared up by a second viewing. This is most definitely a great picture.",9,2,6,27 September 2015
Departures," Mediocre
","Last year's Best Foreign Film winner at the Academy Awards. It's exactly the kind of film they like: sweet, simple and uninspired. Seriously, Japan can do so much better than this. Masahiro Motoki (great in Tsukamoto's Gemini and Miike's The Bird People in China) stars as an out-of-work cellist who takes a job at a funeral home. Those who prepare the dead in Japan have historically been met with great prejudices. People just don't trust people in Japan who touch the dead and make their living off of misery. So Motoki fights prejudice, even loses his wife (the adorable Ryoko Hirosue) for a while. Eventually, he discovers that the service he is providing is valuable and helps people. The film isn't bad, really. It's just nothing special and occasionally schmaltzy. The only thing I really liked was Jo Hisaishi's musical score. There's one piece during a montage that's especially killer.",6,7,21,7 February 2010
The Descent," Scary? Yes. Original? Not by a long shot.
","I'm tempted to rate this higher than I'm going to because it's so rare that a horror movie is genuinely scary. When it's at its best, The Descent is extremely blood-curdling. Don't read any further if you don't want spoilers (though they are light spoilers, they are nonetheless spoilers). It also avoids effectively my pet peeve in horror movies: the women characters (and the major characters in this film are all women) don't fight back like wusses. Most women in thrillers and horror movies whack their enemy on the head once and then run away. These ladies know that if they don't give it their all, they'll be dead. So, anyway, it's a horror movie that's scary and not stupid. What's not to love? My problem was that writer/director Mashall goes out of his way to hit every cliché in the book. It may be effective, but it's far from original. A lot of the film is just Aliens, and that final shock is total J-horror. Most of the scares are achieved by the cheap 'boo' tactic. The film is much more effective when it isn't deafening us with musical stings. The entire prologue feels extraneous, and there isn't even a pay-off that involves it. The film really should have just started with the six women meeting at the cabin the night before the spelunking. They would have lost 20 minutes, but that resulting 80 minute horror film would have been better. The characters in general are pretty weak. They aren't as bad as your run-of-the-mill horror flick, but they aren't that much better, either. Still, it works and it's well worth seeing. Definitely see it in the dark if you do.",7,1,3,7 August 2006
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Quite possibly the worst film ever made
","This movie is so bad, it is an insult to all those films it ripped off, particularly Reservoir Dogs, which I didn't even like all that much anyway. I know the director claimed that he never saw any of Tarantino's films, and it actually shows in just how terrible Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels was. Let's see, take four or five white guys who look more or less exactly the same, write an overly complicated crime plot, make it as violent as possible, presto, you can impress people with low iqs. 1/10",1,10,27,5 January 2001
Les Misérables," I think I'm the only one, but I hate the music; Hathaway is brilliant, though
","I seem to be alone among the detractors of this film in that I thought Tom Hooper's work was fine on it. I just think the original music, which is supposed to be about the best ever written for a stage musical, to range from mediocre to downright lousy. With the one big exception of 'I Dreamed a Dream,' which is average, at best, but which is so powerfully delivered by stand-out Anne Hathaway that I was kind of blown away by it, I felt like I was trapped in the same three or four tunes being re-worked over and over again, written as if with a rhyming dictionary in hand and not that well sung by the cast. Pretty much 99% of the film's dialogue is sung, so it should come as no surprise that I kind of hated it. Still, there are a lot of good things about it: besides Russell Crowe, who is poor as Javert, the cast acts well. Again, Hathaway, in particular, is just outstanding. I'll never forget the 'I Dreamed a Dream' sequence, and, really, the whole film holds up as far less than shear torture simply because that sequence is so damned powerful.",5,3,8,6 January 2013
The Da Vinci Code," Critics were right: it stinks, big time!
","The critical reaction to this film was just vile, but then a lot of normal people who saw it afterward said, 'Nah, it's pretty good.' I'm here to tell you that the initial critical reception was right on the money for this one. It's God-awful. A symbologist and a cryptologist (two fields of study which probably do exist, I suppose, but sound awfully made-up) get framed for murder and get caught up in an ages-old clash between factions of the Catholic church. The movie mostly consists of the two scholars (Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou) racing from one locale to another solving riddles and puzzles, and just barely escaping the cops and the villains each time. The puzzles are reminiscent of the ones the Riddler produced on the 1960s Batman show: they're completely inane; no one could ever solve them, certainly not the audience. But somehow the heroes figure it all out in a matter of seconds. It's about as much fun as watching someone do a Sudoku when you don't know the rules. And the characters are as paper-thin as they could possibly be. I had absolutely zero involvement with them or their adventure. Dan Brown's novel is famously terrible, and, while I've often heard cinema improves his painful prose, after watching this film I shiver to think what actually reading him feels like. If the plot weren't enough to convince me, the dialogue is terrible. The actors are all only here for the fat paycheck. Hanks in particular seems completely dissatisfied with the part. Possibly the worst movie of the year.",3,4,10,27 November 2006
Titanic," Something amiss...
","I understand why every Dick and Jane on the planet liked this, but why did the critics give it such good reviews? I mean, it is not, contrary to popular opinion, the worst movie ever made (although, yes, it may be the most overhyped, although The Matrix and Star Wars: Episode 1 are huge contenders). It is merely bad. There are very few things to like in this film. Technically, it succeeds to a point. I really did believe that I was watching a real ship sink (well, since the model built by Cameron for the film was just barely a model and more a full-sized ship, it ought to look real!). Some of the CGI was terrible, though. The people falling from the boat were so obviously digitally created that I laughed a bit. The writing is extraordinarily weak. Dialogue is just as bad. Everything that happened in the film, which takes over 3 hours, can easily be related on a cocktail napkin. The worst part about it has to be the acting. Kate Winslet has actually been good, elsewhere, but here she has nothing to work with. DiCaprio is bad. There's no saving him - his career, much like that of a boy band, is going down the toilet as I type (he's starting to gain weight and get greasy like Marlon Brando did - this sort of right is only reserved for actors of Brando's status, so stop it now, Leo!). Billy Zane is awful, too, but it is mostly that his part is so insubstantial.So do you believe in payolas? It's beginning to make me curious that such obviously bad films as Titanic, American Pie, and The Matrix all got rave reviews from critics. All three of the films were abominations. And you may ask, what does it matter if a critic reviews it well? I don't care about their opinion! Not true, my friend. Even if your insecurities tell you that critics are unimportant, you always secretly feel victory when the consensus is for a film you really like. Therefore, there are no guilty feelings after you have enjoyed something like Titanic so much. Instead, you feel for a fading second that, yes, you are part of high culture. You understand art. BLAH! It's all just sinister psychology working its claws over simple minds.And for those of you who absolutely despise this film, I can guess your favorite pictures: Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Fight Club, and, of course, The Matrix. Well, you people should actually begin to learn what REAL film is. Rent A Night to Remember, the best film about the Titanic's sinking. It is not the greatest film ever made, but it is great.",4,3,10,10 March 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," How to take advantage of your children's naivety for the sake of cold cash...
","I have, in all my life as a lover of both literature and the cinema, hardly ever come upon a piece of work more unimaginative, more ugly, more uninteresting, more lacking in suspense, more lacking in charm, more greedy, more incoherent... Okay, okay. I'll stop with the superlative negatives. Surely there have been worse, and, yes, off the top of my head, I can think of many that are worse. However, for a book that over 125 million people have read, and for a movie that cemented the record for the biggest opening weekend in history, and also for a book that has had not only kids but critics singing its praises, and also for a movie which one particularly fat-headed critic called the Wizard of Oz of its generation, I am more than severely disappointed. I know that, had it not been so overhyped, it would have been just as bad. Now, however, my anger for it is completely hardened and it's going to be a passionate battle for me for years to come.I go into an in depth criticism, but it would be impossible for me to keep to 1000 words. There is hardly a piece of it that I liked. As a film, it was poorly edited, poorly acted (by most), poorly filmed. The only really memorable scene is the troll in the bathroom, although the payoff to it makes no sense whatsoever. The Quidditch game, which has been hyped to all heaven, is completely boring and poorly created. It looks like the FX guys created it with photoshop. When the chess game looked like it was about to be the most exciting sequence in the film, Christopher Columbus, who, I must say, lives up to his reputation completely, begins to edit furiously. I heard afterwards that this was done to avoid a PG-13. My immediate thought is that the filmmakers didn't trust their young audience to enjoy watching a chess game, no matter how exciting it might have been. I'm still not sure which story to buy.But the person I really want to tear into is J.K. Rowling. What a hack. Never has the word 'hack' been more fitting. A former waitress, her idea of imagination is to call things by weird names. Only in the mind of a psychopath (or idiot) could the name Draco Malfoy or a Cerberus clone named Fluffy be considered clever. Writing children's literature is not difficult, but this is simply awful. She's clearly ripping off Raoul Dahl like there's no tomorrow, especially in the exposition. The game of Quidditch, which seems to be a drawing point of some sort, is absolutely nonsensical. As a preteen, I invented much more interesting games with much less interesting playing pieces. Quidditch is a game where people score ten points at a time, unless someone catches a special type of ball, which ends the game immediately. So theoretically, the game could end in thirty seconds. And all the other forms of scoring matter not at all. And let's talk about the surprise climax. Really, anyone could have been standing in front of that mirror at the end. It is tremendously unclever. And the penultimate sequence, where the crown is awarded to the best dorm, is anticlimactic and just rude to the children of Slytherin, We only hate one of them, so why should we be happy that the award at first goes to them, and then is cruelly snatched away. And what about Hogwart, anyways? If you're not supposed to use magic when you're away from Hogwart, why the heck would you want to be a wizard anyways?Friends, you're well on the path to making your children drooling morons. If they want a great series of books about sorcery and magic creatures, make them read the Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis. This is the most soulless garbage imaginable. And I thought Shrek had taken that title. 3/10",3,14,35,22 November 2001
Thor," Perfectly decent superhero flick
","Marvel re-uses its Iron Man strategy by throwing far too much talent at a comic book movie. The results are, much like with Iron Man, actually pretty good, though quite far from great. Chris Hemsworth stars as the Norse god. The story takes place in both Asgard and Midgard (Earth). In Asgard, Thor has led an attack against the Frost Giants. Odin, his father (Anthony Hopkins), banishes Thor to Earth and gives his kingdom over to Thor's scheming brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The other gods (including a black and Asian one, although, who cares, they're played by Idris Elba and Tadanobu Asano!) are suspicious of Loki and plan to get Thor back. On Earth, Thor is now a mortal. A big dude, still, but he finds that little things like getting hit by cars to be quite painful. He's discovered by a team of astrophysicists (Natalie Portman, in her third movie of 2011, Stellan Skarsgard and Kat Dennings). Portman thinks that Thor might know something about the weird atmospheric disturbances she's been documenting lately. It's a fun movie. Although it's mostly just CGI, Asgard is always great to look at. When they do use sets, they're cool. And the costume design, while a tad silly, is wonderful to look at. The Earth sequences would probably be a lot less fun, but the writers have a great sense of humor. The fish-out-of-water stuff is very funny, especially the scene where Thor enters a pet store and demands a horse. The actors mostly do a good job. Hemsworth, a relative newcomer, looks like he might be a mindless hunk or a wrestler-turned-actor, but he does a good job. He has a certain charm which most people who look like underwear models don't. Portman kind of fails, but the script is mostly to blame. There's very little time for a romantic angle, but they've shoved it in anyway, and it's pretty unconvincing. My favorite performances were from Hiddleston, who perhaps has the most complexly written character in the movie, and Elba, whom I didn't recognize at first past his costume and glowing yellow eyes. He's definitely the coolest character in the movie. Kat Dennings is really funny with her scene-stealing role as a political science student who is only working with Portman for the college credits. Dennings is a star in the making (check her out in the excellent Defendor) and probably should already be bigger than she is. One could complain that there's too much setting up of the Avengers movie, due out next year, but I generally don't mind that. I like the connectedness of the Marvel films (this one calls out Iron Man and the Hulk). A couple of the Avengers preview sequences are somewhat confusing, though. Like that guy who looks a little like Jeremy Renner (played by Jeremy Renner) who is ordered to snipe Thor but then picks up a bow and arrow, or the completely baffling post-credits sequence with Samuel L. Jackson (seriously, I couldn't make any sense of what was going on there).",8,1,4,15 May 2011
The Godfather: Part III," Not bad, but unnecessary third part of the series
","I've seen the first two parts a few times each, but never got around to the much-maligned third installment until now. Not that everyone hates it. It was well reviewed and was nominated for Best Picture. It's that one element that garners most of the hate. You know which one. And, I have to say, Ms. Coppola's performance deserves the derision. It's a rare performance - a supporting one, at that - that drags the whole film down a level. She just has no business being in front of a camera. The film after her is hardly perfect, either. Pacino has entered his hammy phase. Keaton is mostly a non-entity. Frankly, the reason to watch, acting-wise, is Andy Garcia, who was the only actor in the film who earned an Oscar nomination. He's usually a bore, but he's excellent here. Talia Shire and Eli Wallach are both pretty good, as well. The film also lacks the focus of the first two films. With all that, though, it's still pretty good. Beautifully produced, of course, and Coppola's directing talent had yet to leave him (by my account, he had one more great film in him, Dracula, before he became worthless).",7,1,2,14 September 2014
The Fountain," I may not have been entirely won over, but I certainly was wowed!
","May be a ways down from perfection, but with such an ambitious project, that's more than understandable, as well as forgivable. It's a poetic, impressionistic mood piece on the desperation of man to escape death, told over three intermingled, interrelated stories, one of a Spanish conquistador, one of a modern experimental doctor and the final of a man in the distant future, hurdling through space. I don't quite like what Aronofsky's solution is, that death is a new version of life. As an atheist, I have a more existential dilemma when it comes to death, and Aronofsky's new-age-y thoughts on the subject are no more helpful than Christianity's. I may disagree with the film's thesis in part, but what I cannot disagree with is how outstanding a film it is. I would take it over almost any other film released this year, certainly most of the best reviewed ones Â– it honestly kicks The Queen's ass. It looks and feels, and even sounds like almost no other film I've seen. The visuals are absolutely astounding (and done without an ounce of CGI, so they have a uniqueness to them). Even the non-sci-fi or historical parts have extremely beautiful visuals. The musical score, by Clint Mansell, is easily the best work of the year. The film really does engulf you in its remarkable aura, like the bubble in which Hugh Jackson travels through space. And the theme of trying to reverse a loved one's mortality is always a powerful one, and something that will stand the test of time. My prediction is, although this seems to be a colossal financial failure on first release, that The Fountain will become a favorite of a lot of people as time moves on.",9,2,6,4 December 2006
Zombieland," Pretty good, though it runs out of ideas by the end
","Fun zombie movie spoof starring Jesse Eisenberg as a nebbish whose host of rules keep him safe during the zombie apocalypse. He meets up with Woody Harrelson, a tough guy who loves killing zombies, as well as two sisters, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin, who aren't nearly as helpless as they first seem. The group travels to Los Angeles, where the two girls believe there is a zombie-free zone at a famous amusement park (Harrelson and Eisenberg aren't so sure). The film starts off fresh with a great montage of slow-motion zombies chasing after their meals, and its quite fun for well over half its run. You may have heard that the film has one of the all-time great cameo appearances ever. That's absolutely true, and if it hasn't already been spoiled for you, stay away from its IMDb page and any other spoiler sources. The movie starts to run out of steam as it nears the end. The final sequence in the amusement park is fun, but characters begin to act stupidly. Plus, you can't help wonder why the heck the power is still running everywhere, and just how in the heck the two gals are running the rides and riding them at the same time (not to mention how they get off said rides without anyone at the controls to stop them). It's definitely a film worth seeing, but I might recommend waiting for video.",7,2,5,4 October 2009
A Beautiful Mind," Good but overrated biopic
","SPOILERSIt's always inspiring to see someone overcome adversity like John Nash, the real-life hero of A Beautiful Mind. A brilliant mathematician, he suffered from sever paranoid schizophrenia for most of his adult life. But he learned to live with it, as normal a life as possible, and he ended up being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1994. It's a great story. Too bad it's so generically told in Ron Howard's film. It's as by-the-numbers as a film like this can really get. The direction is bland, and the writing can be quite dull at times. Shine, for instance, is a much better film very similar in plot and structure. I must make an interjection in my own criticisms for this film, though. One reason why A Beautiful Mind may lack power is that it had some major points spoiled in the advertising. We don't actually know in the film, not until a long time in, that Nash is suffering delusions and fantasies. For instance, Ed Harris' character is imaginary, which can be deduced almost instantly. But would I have assumed that if I didn't know what the film was about? Can't be so sure.Anyhow, A Beautiful Mind is well worth seeing. The actors are pretty good. Russel Crowe may have given his best performance so far in the film. He won an Oscar last year for a rather lame role in Gladiator, but if he wins this year (I write this the night before the Oscars air, by the way) it will be very deserved. We've got an actor here who will continue to impress the hell out of us. Hopefully he can restrain himself from beating the crap out of people (I think that it might cost him the award, but we'll see in approximately 24 hours! An update: it did). Jennifer Connely is good, but she's been a lot better elsewhere, most notably in Dark City and Requiem for a Dream. It wouldn't be too out of line to award her, though. The rest of the awards it has been nominated for can vanish, for all I care. There's nothing special about Ron Howard's direction. It may be his best film, but that's a backhanded complement coming from me. The editing is plain. James Horner's score is particularly bad. It's far too overdramatic. The makeup is a possibility, though. Russel Crowe's old man makeup is quite good. I give the film a 7/10.",7,7,15,27 March 2002
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Uneven action comedy starring two of Hollywood's biggest and most attractive stars
","When it's good, it's good, but it takes way too long to establish the premise. Two rival spies with licenses to kill get married, but they don't know each other's secret. Five or six years into the marriage, they find out and are each ordered to kill the other. That's fine with them, as their marriage is kind of fizzling. It's a golden concept, but the trailers and commercials have already informed 99.99% of the audience of it. We really don't need 40 minutes of Pitt and Jolie acting like a stereotypical cold married couple. Plus, the movie starts with a flashback to when the two met in Bogota, Columbia. Neither seems to wonder at all why the other was in such a turbulent part of the world in the first place. After about 40 minutes, during which I was concentrating on Angelina Jolie's outrageously sexy body and face lest I fall asleep, after the two have found out about each other, it begins to pick up with some very entertaining action sequences. I love how the movie plays the generic problems of married couples against the background of espionage and professional killing. The movie is going along very well for most of its remainder, but, unfortunately, it doesn't end well. They seem to be going for a Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid ending, but, of course, in a summer blockbuster, that ain't gonna cut it. Vince Vaughn co-stars. I don't know about him. He always seems to be just on the verge of being funny, but he never quite makes it there. Adam Brody, the nerd/hunk second banana from Fox's The O.C., also has a nice little role. He has a couple of the film's funniest lines. The body count of this movie has to be at least at 50, and guns are a'blazin' constantly. The film was rated PG-13 by the MPAA  but only after a sex scene was cut out. You've got to love the MPAA!",6,5,11,23 June 2005
The Departed," Average Scorsese - which means it's still a fine film, just not one of his best
","Scorsese's long-awaited remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs. Infernal Affairs was a good film, but it always seemed to me like a gimmick, and more like a skeleton of a film than a real film. Scorsese predictably fleshes it out so it doesn't seem as much like just a good concept. The actors add a lot to it, too (though the Hong Kong actors, including Andy Lau and Tony Leung, were very good, as well). I don't think it stands anywhere near Scorsese's best work myself. It doesn't carry near the weight of Goodfellas, for instance. It starts to get a little silly near the end, and the director makes a few really bad choices Â– especially including that awful image in the final shot. That's just plain embarrassing film-making. And that's not to mention the awful choice the filmmakers made to change a certain part of the ending of Infernal Affairs - the original is definitely stronger in that respect. Of the actors, my favorite was Mark Wahlberg. Matt Damon comes in second, and DiCaprio third. Nicholson has a lot of fun as the gangster. The best comparison with previous Jack performances is actually the Joker from Burton's first Batman movie. Alec Baldwin has probably the most memorable moment, where he expresses his love for the Patriot Act. Well worth seeing, but definitely not best-of-the-year material. I would rank it quite below Scorsese's previous two films from this decade, The Aviator and Gangs of New York.",8,7,14,9 October 2006
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Besides the Racially Insensitive Robot Twins, who amused me to no end (but not in the way they were intended to amuse me), there's nothing worth seeing in this movie
","I saw this at an outdoor theater the night before the Fourth of July. I don't generally like outdoor movies. The atmosphere is kind of neat, kind of retro, but with modern sound design, you're really missing out on something by going to them nowadays. I didn't really care about Transformers 2, though. The first one wasn't that bad, but it wasn't that good, either. Its main problem is that the giant CGI robots were horribly designed and hard to tell apart. They don't look so much like the Transformers that came out of the package as I bought them as a kid as the Transformers that came out of the microwave after my little brother cooked them a little. The action sequences were somewhat incomprehensible, especially the ones with multiple Transformers fighting. The sequel is far worse in this respect, and pretty much all other respects, as well. I think all the action sequences are made up of multiple robots fighting, and you can't tell who they are. Not that it matters, since none of them have an ounce of personality. There's two exceptions to this, though, that provide the film's only entertainment, as prurient as it is. The twin Autobots are the two biggest racial stereotypes that I've seen in a movie since the 1980s. My God, one even has a gold tooth. I think their names are Mantan and Sleep 'n' Eat. This offensiveness amused me to no end. 'Damn! He got et!' Other than that, there's a couple of humping dogs, a small robot that humps Megan Fox's leg, and a Decepticon 'scrotum' to laugh at. You have to be pretty juvenile even for that, and luckily I am. If you're not, there's nothing else. And this movie runs two and a half hours! How? The plot is overcomplicated, but still pretty simple and easy to follow. Whenever a character needs to get out of some seemingly impossible situation, they're thrown a special power which has never been mentioned previously. The people who wrote the screenplay need to be shot. Bay doesn't deserve much better. I'm not actually a Bay hater, but he has made a handful of really awful movies. This isn't even his worst - that would be Armageddon. But this is pretty close to as bad.",3,3,16,6 July 2009
The Witch," A great horror film
","Legitimately terrifying horror film set in 1630s. A family banished from regular society makes their humble home at the edge of the deep woods. They are on the brink of starvation, with their decimated crop, but they have more immediate problems when their youngest baby is kidnapped by something from the woods. The remaining children (a teenage girl (played by the terrific Anya Taylor-Joy), a slightly younger teen boy, and two creepy twins who seem to be best friends with their pet goat) are threatened by their parents' grief and religious fervor (the parents are well played by Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie). First off, the film is just gorgeous to look at. Eggers has done marvels with the details of this film, and based the period-appropriate dialogue on actual writings of the time. I also have to thank any director making a film like this who's obviously seen and loved Benjamin Christensen's Haxan. I am not 100% sure what I feel about the ending of the film - it's either a bit too little or a bit too much. It's most certainly one of the best horror films of recent years.",10,2,9,26 February 2016
Zero Dark Thirty," Okay, and the raid is some excellent filmmaking, but Chastain is weak and it drags
","Not bad, but I'm really at a loss to explain critics tripping over their own feet trying to exalt it. The story is interesting, but, of course, this being a movie, you have to take its history of events with a grain of salt, which makes it kind of worthless in that respect. Cinematically, the raid sequence is by far the highlight, and definitely one of the best sequences of the year (I didn't time it but it had to run for 30 or 40 minutes), but after that it's fairly pedestrian. And I've gone from a waffling Jessica Chastain skeptic to full-on Jessica Chastain denier. She's very mediocre in this film, having little presence and delivering her big lines with no conviction ('I'm the m.f.er who found this' had my eyes rolling hard). Since most of the story revolves around her, I didn't find anything in particular to attach to. I wasn't bored, per se, but I wasn't much interested, either. The character doesn't even do much. Her big break comes straight from someone else's hands. The best you can say about her is that she's the one who insisted upon it. The Jennifer Ehle subplot is so embarrassing you hope like Hell it never really happened, and, as far as the filmmaking is concerned, it's one of the worst sequences of the year, at least in a major film, so telegraphed and drawn out that if I was watching it on DVD I probably would have just skipped to the next chapter. There aren't any standout performances in the film, but I was happy to see Harold Perrineau, Mark Duplass and Chris Pratt show up. All in all, it is definitely worth seeing, but don't expect much.",7,3,9,13 January 2013
War of the Worlds," The best film of 2005, in my opinion
","As this was one of the more memorable films I saw in 2005, and as it was also one of the most obviously flawed, I was afraid it would be worse upon a revisiting. I'm glad to say I was entirely wrong about that. It got better. In fact, when you know the flaws are coming, it's easier to concentrate on its strengths. I'm starting to think this could be Spielberg's best film. I don't think its themes, its intentions, or its results have been completely considered by either the director of the screenwriters, so the messages it emits are mixed. But I think that makes the film all the more interesting. In Munich, Spielberg's far more critically lauded film of 2005, we are told what to think at every juncture. War of the Worlds emotes and informs at a more intuitive level. There's a lot more to think about with this film than pretty much any other film the man has ever made. The logic of the film is often flawed, but the images and the feelings they produce are palpable. Is it just utilizing the post-9/11 zeitgeist to create an entertaining actioner? I think it's deeper than that, certainly. It is an action film, a summer blockbuster, but it's more deeply felt than any other I can think of. It's entertaining, but it's not the kind of film that you can walk away from feeling good. I think that's one of the main reasons for its failure with much of the audience. Whatever the case, this is the most memorable and effective film of the year, and I am now confidently ranking this as the best film of 2005.",10,6,11,30 January 2006
12 Years a Slave," Heartrending true story of slavery
","This year's sure thing for Best Picture. I don't personally think it's the best picture of the year, but no doubt it'll be one of the more deserving of that award (it ranks #6 on my 2013 list as of right now). It's an utterly devastating picture, doubtlessly the most thorough, accurate and brutal portrayal of slavery in the American South ever committed to film. Chiwetel Ejiofor stars as a free man in the North. While touring as a fiddler with circus performers, he is kidnapped by slavers and transported to the South. He becomes the property of plantation owner Benedict Cumberbatch, who is a fairly benevolent master, but he soon crosses ways with his overseer (Paul Dano), and Cumberbatch is forced to sell him to a much crueler man (Michael Fassbender). Fassbender is keen on raping his slaves, in particular Lupita Nyong'o. Ejiofor, who at this point realizes that the only way he can survive is to keep his head low, becomes entwined in the drama between Fassbender, Nyong'o and Sarah Paulson, playing Fassbender's wife. Ejiofor has been a fantastic actor for over a decade now (I first noticed him in Dirty Pretty Things, but he also had a major role in Amistad, which I never did see), but this is the role he'll be remembered for. He gives one of the subtlest performances in recent memory. In many ways, he has to. His role is all reaction - while he does get a couple of big emotional scenes, mostly he's playing a man who has to keep his head down. He's an educated man, and if his masters catch wind of it, they could very well kill him. What he witnesses, though, in addition to what he suffers himself, is so horrifying that it becomes impossible not to react. Of the rest of the cast (which also includes Brad Pitt and plenty of other familiar faces), I think the only other one who deserves accolades is Nyong'o, who just kills it. Adepero Oduye, as a woman who refuses to stop weeping for her children, who were sold elsewhere, also impresses. In my estimation, none of the white actors really deserve too much praise. Cumberbatch and Dano are probably the best. Fassbinder's likely to get all the awards attention, but I thought he was pretty unsubtle, almost to the point of mustache twirling. McQueen's direction is very subtle, almost to the point where you won't even notice how good it is. One major complaint I have is that you don't really feel the time pass. If it weren't called 12 Years a Slave, you wouldn't even think more than a couple of years had passed by the end of it. Honestly, it could have been longer. But, then, it can be such a harrowing watch that I don't know that I'd want to see any more. I wouldn't say it was painful to sit through, though. I'd see it again in a heartbeat. It's rare you get a film so genuinely powerful.",10,6,12,10 November 2013
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," Cute but forgettable
","Michael Cera plays Nick, a rock musician who has recently been dumped by his girlfriend (Alexis Dziena). The rest of his band forces him into the arms of a beautiful girl, Norah (Kat Dennings) who has showed up to their show. The film takes place over one night in New York City, and we watch the two kids fall for each other while some hip music plays over the soundtrack. The two leads are quite charming. We've seen Cera do this same role before, so Dennings is the real surprise here. She's stunning, and this movie's sure to make her a big star. The casting is quite off in this movie, though. It's the kind of movie where Norah is frequently chastised for being a nerd and ugly and sexually inexperienced, but she never comes off as such. Dziena comes off as far too sexy to have been dating Cera in any life. Jay Baruchel shows up as Norah's on-again-off-again boyfriend, and, if you're familiar with his career anyway, he's way too dorky and likable to be playing any sort of villain. Or even anyone cool. I did like the three gay guys who comprised the rest of Cera's band. Aaron Yoo is quite good. He was also in the underrated film Rocket Science last year.",6,2,2,8 February 2009
30 Days of Night," Good concept, mediocre execution
","Vampire flick with a great concept: vampires invade Barrow, Alaska, the northernmost town in the United States, during the one month a year in which there is no sunshine. Josh Hartnett plays the town sheriff, Melissa George his ex-wife (I think) and Danny Huston the leader of the vampires. These vampires are the kind of modern movie monsters that aren't so suave as your classic vampire, but rabid, brutal, slobbering monsters. As such, director Slade applies 28 Days Later-like shaky-cam during the action sequences. That worked fairly well in 28 Days Later and its sequel, but is kind of annoying here. The film is actually pretty good at building a terrifying mood, and, despite the shaky-cam, the monsters are pretty scary. The heroes, on the other hand, are rather boring. The plot is basically your cast attrition model where a group of stereotypes gets picked off one-by-one. The film is condensed from a graphic novel, and I'd bet the source material is better. There are quite a few moments that felt underexplained, and though the film is supposed to cover a whole month, several days are skipped at a time and most of the action seems to take place in just a couple of days. I would still have probably given the movie a slight recommendation, but I thought the climax was rather silly.",6,2,4,24 August 2008
Wedding Crashers," When it's funny, it's real funny
","his was the highest grossing comedy of 2005. It ain't bad. They have a little too much of the romance plot in the film, which is sappy and occasionally slows down the picture. There's also a way-too-long montage near the beginning where we see Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn crashing a bunch of weddings that should have been way funnier. Coming so early in the movie, it had me a little worried. But, when it gets going, it is often laugh-out-loud funny. I always knew that Vince Vaughn had some real comedic talent. He's always fairly amusing in any comedy he's in, but I've never seen a movie where the material was really up to his abilities. Here, he gets most of the best material. That's almost disappointing just for the fact that he's co-starring with Owen Wilson and Christopher Walken (the latter sits on the sidelines through almost all the movie), but Vaughn manages always to keep the movie funny. Wilson, I think, is a very funny man, and he is often funny here. But he's the one stuck in the romantic plot of the film, and they don't let him be as funny as he ought to be. If the screenwriters had balanced things out a little, let both the stars work their stuff, this probably would have been the best comedy of the year. Isla Fisher is also pretty amusing as the crazy girl who falls for Vaughn. There's also an actor who appears in a cameo late in the picture who is simply hilarious, but I won't ruin that for anyone. Rachel McAdams, whom I think is the most beautiful woman alive right now, is sweet as the love interest, but, in that role, she has little to do.",7,0,1,30 January 2006
There Will Be Blood," One of the most memorable characters of 2007 in one of the year's best films
","Wunderkind Paul Thomas Anderson's new film calls to mind Orson Welles' Citizen Kane in its themes and subject, and, shockingly, it's a good enough film to sit side by side with the one most often dubbed the greatest movie ever. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Daniel Plainview, an oil prospector who will do anything to be a success in the business. Much like Citizen Kane, There Will Be Blood depicts how the lust for money will eventually alienate every human being around you, and eventually make you completely isolated from the world. Unlike Citizen Kane, Daniel Plainview doesn't just grow apart from the world, he also becomes insane. There is a lot of metaphorical subtext lining the film's bottom, especially concerning the relationship between fundamentalist Christianity and big business. It's all very interesting to ponder. I don't know if I think the film is one of the most intellectually stimulating movies I've ever seen. For the record, I don't think Citizen Kane is, either. The message 'money corrupts', while probably true, isn't especially insightful. What both films have in spades is a director with incredible talent who can envelop their audience in the rapturous experience of pure cinema. The desolate, desert setting sucks you in deeply and never lets you go. Every gravelly word spoken by Day-Lewis is anticipated with both glee and dread. It could have went on for three more hours, and only my bladder would have given notice. My only small grumble is Paul Dano in the final scene. He's good throughout, don't get me wrong, but that final sequence takes place over a decade after the last time we saw Eli Sunday. Daniel Plainview has aged, his son (as a child wonderfully played by the wide-eyed Dillon Freasier) has aged. Why is nothing done to Paul Dano to make him look older? At least give him a mustache! I think there must have been a reason for it, but I can't for the life of me imagine what that would be. Otherwise, an amazing experience.",10,25,48,13 January 2008
Whiplash," Fantastic
","A musical thriller? This one's hard to categorize. One might say it's the exact opposite of an inspirational teacher movie, like Goodbye Mr. Chips. Miles Teller plays an eager drumming student at a music conservatory. He captures the attention of the head honcho of the school's peak band crew, J.K. Simmons. A normal person would wish they hadn't, because the guy's a total psycho. One wrong note or beat and the guy'll be roaring every curse word in the book at you. He's a legend, though, so no one would ever dare stand up to him. Teller is not a normal person - his dream is to be one of the best of all time, so he tries his damnedest to take Simmons' rage in stride. It's not easy. This film is simply gripping. Teller is amazingly focused. One ought not to disregard his physical performance, either. While the editing probably helped him survive this, he really is going to town on those drums. Simmons gives a performance for the ages. I wanted to murder this dude. As a supporting character, the film doesn't get too deeply into what his deal is, but the little bits that are shown are fascinating. The finale is absolutely outstanding. One of the year's best, no doubt.",9,3,6,16 November 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Hugely entertaining, if a little long
","Martin Scorsese redoes Goodfellas in the financial sector. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jordan Belfort, a young man immediately smitten with the ruthlessness of Wall Street (at first represented by Matthew McConaughey in a hilarious cameo). After the market sees a startling crash in the late '80s, DiCaprio gets pushed out of the big leagues. He quickly finds a way in smaller markets, pushing penny stocks. He figures out ways, not all of them strictly legal, to make cash hand over fist. Soon, paired with new best friend Jonah Hill, he opens his own firm. All the rules go out the door as he pulls in millions of dollars a year, which leads to all sorts of drug-fueled mayhem. The draw here is the pure debauchery. It will surely offend some, but the pure spectacle of depravity is enormously amusing. The film really doesn't want to think too hard about the awful things that Belfort is doing, which is kind of a bold choice. Sure, he does end up suffering in the end, but, with all he experienced beforehand, the little bit of suffering seems almost worth it. It could easily be argued that it's a hugely immoral film, but I think it just wants to put us in the action. The film has an epic runtime, which isn't really deserved. I wasn't exactly bored with it (though I was feeling it physically), but it could have been shortened. DiCaprio gives one of his best performances, but I was most amused by Hill. Many will despise his abrasive character, but I thought he was hilarious.",8,18,31,31 December 2013
The Last King of Scotland," Fine film
","Historical horror movie about General Idi Amin, the brutal Ugandan dictator of the 1970s. It's told through the eyes of a fictional person (as far as I can tell), Nicholas Garrigan. In the film, he's a Scot who comes to Uganda as a doctor. Upon a chance meeting with the new President, Garrigan is taken to the country's capital to be his head physician. Garrigan is more or less in isolation. He's having a ball while the rest of the country is going to Hell. Amin treats him well, and by the time it becomes apparent that he's hardly the benevolent dictator he presents himself as, Garrigan can't get away. Perhaps it's disingenuous to create a fictional character in this situation, but Idi Amin himself is too much of a beast to focus the entire film on. It works better to make him the monster at the edge of the frame. I wouldn't say Whitaker gives the very best performance of 2006, but he is excellent, and deserving of his eventual Oscar. It's not a great film, but I really liked it. It's scary and gripping from first to last.",8,1,4,29 January 2007
"Hail, Caesar!"," Second tier Coens still equals a great movie
","Maybe not one of the Coens' masterpieces, but easily in their second tier, which means it's great. It depicts a day in the life of a Hollywood studios in the 1950s, with Josh Brolin as the studio head whose job it is to keep things running smoothly. The main plot revolves around the kidnapping of the star of the studio's gigantic Biblical epic, Hail, Caesar!, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney). Several other movie stars play parts on the sidelines, including Scarlett Johansson as an Esther Williams-type swimming musical star, Channing Tatum as another musical star, and Alden Ehrenreich as a Western star who has been transferred to a more sophisticated drama. Ehrenreich, despite being the least familiar actor among the cast, steals the show. There are tons of familiar faces in the film (Ralph Fiennes, Jonah Hill, Wayne Knight, Fisher Stevens, David Krumholtz, Frances MacDormand, Tilda Swinton - playing twins!) and many of them don't get more than a minute of screen time (Hill, for example - you've seen his entire performance in the trailer, and he made it onto the poster), but everyone's highly amusing. The plot might not amount to much, but it's all a lot of fun, and, as you would expect, wonderfully shot and directed.",9,73,138,7 February 2016
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Thank God! A movie that is actually funny!
","I was afraid I'd be getting another Dodgeball here, especially when I saw that the completely talentless Vince Vaughn was on the payroll, but nope. This doesn't pull any punches. It's also the movie that Will Ferrell deserves to star in. He's far too funny to make crap like Old School and Elf. This is his movie and he dominates. His talent with words is unmistakable. He plays arrogant anchorman Ron Burgundy, of course. Christina Applegate wants to take his job away from him and become the first anchorwoman in the United States (the story takes place in the 1970s). Applegate doesn't have too much to do here, although some of her insults are classic. She's mostly the straightman here. Most of the laughs after Ferrell come from his news team, made up of Paul Rudd, David Koechner, and Steven Carell. They're all funny, but Carell, as a weatherman with a tiny IQ, gets the most laughs. The movie is successful both when it is playing jokes on Burgundy's arrogance and when it gets entirely surreal. The funniest scene in the film involves a huge rumble between five different news teams. I could hardly breathe during this sequence. And the climactic scene is outrageous! Anchorman also employs two devices that usually betray a sense of desperation, the celebrity cameo and outtakes during the credits. It might be the only time these cameos ever made me laugh, and the outtakes are really funny mostly because they are made up of alternative improvisations. Except for an outtake from Smoky and the Bandit that hilariously sneaks up. I can't imagine that there'll be a funnier movie this year. In fact, as it is easily the most consistently good movie I've seen in 2004, it probably qualifies as my favorite film of the year, at least so far. 9/10.",9,1,3,11 July 2004
American Gangster," Well made, but too familiar
","Ridley Scott is one of those directors who has built up a lot of good will from audiences, including myself, over the years. But as each successive film of his is released, I find myself wondering why that is. Two of his movies, Alien and Blade Runner, are arguably masterpieces. Does he have more than maybe a couple more that are even good? Granted, I've missed a couple of well-liked works, notably Black Hawk Down, but the guy also has made Kingdom of Heaven, Hannibal and A Good Year. He's incredibly uneven. His newest film is a gangster epic. It's good, very classically made, respectable, entertaining enough. But it's nothing special. There is not even one moment in it where I was thinking 'wow'. Its best sequence, the raid on the drug lab, is easily topped by the similar scene in We Own the Night, which opened last month. Denzel Washington's performance isn't anything we haven't seen him give before, and Russell Crowe's is too methody to be considered very good (he was better in 3:10 to Yuma, but he was methody there, too). And it's a huge sin to waste Chiwetel Ejiofor this badly. The story is your basic criminal rise and fall, with a side story of the hard-working, honest cop. The film offers no insight into the situation. There are about seven montage sequences set to era-appropriate pop music. The honest truth is, I barely remembered I saw this movie four hours after it ended. If you've seen The Godfather or Goodfellas, you don't need to see it. On the other hand, if your options are this, Scarface or Blow, you'd be best off with this. Just don't pay too much for it. A rental, at best.",7,10,23,4 November 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," Good concept! Now if they had just come up with a coherent and natural script to go along with it.
","One of the bigger disappointments of the year. The concept is interesting, and the cast is more than promising. Will Ferrell, in a slightly more serious role than usual, plays an IRS agent who begins to hear a British woman (Emma Thompson) narrating his humdrum life. It's merely an annoyance until he hears that his death is imminent. He attempts to discover where this story is going, through the help of an English professor (Dustin Hoffman), but eventually he just decides to live life to its fullest, which includes getting a girl (Maggie Gyllenhaal) to like him finally. The general problem is that it feels like the screenwriter (Zach Helm) came up with a great concept, but never really figured out where to go with it. Also, he never even comes close to figuring out how to reconcile the fantastic premise with the real world, in which the rest of the film firmly takes place. After the concept has been established, you can really feel Helm uncomfortably forcing the story along. Gyllenhaal's character is one of the best examples. She's made completely two dimensional, a supposed über-liberal hippie chick who despises Ferrell (who is auditing her) at first sight, but who later sleeps with him just because he plays her what we assume to be her favorite punk song (we assume because we're given pretty much no information, except that there's a Clash song playing in her bakery earlier, though the song he plays isn't a Clash song). It's one of the worst roles I've seen in 2006, and Gyllenhaal is at a loss, giving what is easily her worst performance ever. Even worse is the character written for Queen Latifah, who is given absolutely nothing to do. One has to wonder why any producer would shell out the money for a name actress when the role requires nothing. The story gets even worse after Ferrell finally finds Emma Thompson and attempts to stop her from finishing his story. He can't bring himself to read the ending (it's in outline format, so it hasn't happened yet), so he gives it to Hoffman. Hoffman declares that the novel is too good (though from what the audience heard of the book, it sucks) for Ferrell to live. At that point, I was totally lost. Luckily it ended quickly enough that I wasn't at the point of despising it yet (a couple of movies this year, namely Little Miss Sunshine, weren't so lucky). Some decent performances and some decent laughs, but it's a pretty big failure.",5,5,11,18 December 2006
The Reader," Didn't do much for me
","A film that I rarely, if ever, got caught up in. It felt like the kind of movie that is based on a much better novel. A 15 year old boy (David Kross, played by Ralph Fiennes as an adult) meets up with a strange older woman (Kate Winslet) and, before long, they have a passionate, tumultuous affair. This first section of the film is pretty good, bringing to mind some of the great, erotic movies about sexual affairs, like maybe Last Tango in Paris. Less erotic than that, really, but it's pretty hot, and Winslet is extremely good in these scenes, carrying an unknown weight that is threatening to crush her. In the second section of the film, we learn just what her deal is. If you've seen any commercials or trailers for it, you already know the secret. If you don't, the film might work a little bit better, have a little more suspense. Personally, it was in the second section of the film where I really stopped caring. Kross is a law student observing a trial in which Winslet is the defendant. There's just too many scenes of Kross staring at Winslet from above, confused as to what he should do. Plus, where the theme of sexual politics and broken hearts is well enough done in the film, I thought it did a bad job building up any deep theme upon the historical events that are the focus of the film. It uses a very serious event, but I felt it didn't explore it in any but the most banal way, like it never even happened. I also thought Winslet started to flounder in these scenes. The final part works a tad better, but I just felt uninvolved by that point. European greats Bruno Ganz and Lena Olin have cameos.",6,3,7,4 January 2009
Jaws," Got to see it in the theater for the first time last week
","I'm not sure I've seen this from start to finish since I'd really learned about film-making. In all honesty, I used to watch Jaws 1 through Revenge regularly on TV in my childhood (I remember staying up really late for USA Network marathons and being scared out of my wits  thank God for commercials!), and I wouldn't have been able to tell you that the original Jaws was the definitive, and only worthy Jaws movie at the time. Seriously, Jaws 3D was just as thrilling (and I didn't even know it was supposed to be in 3D!), and I vividly recall, having seen the first three of them several times, how excited I was when Jaws: The Revenge first appeared on TV (I was probably around 10). I wonder if I would have been happier had I remained just as ignorant. Hmm Anyhow, I'm not, and, damn it, I can tell you that Steven Spielberg's Jaws is one of the single most amazing feats of film-making ever. It's just astounding how ingrained some of these images are in my head. And just how chilling the film remains after 30+ years. There is one moment that I wish I had forgotten, just so that I could experience it again for the first time: when Roy Scheider is shoveling chum into the water, facing the camera, and the shark jumps out of the water to catch some. This is the first time in the film that the monster appears without his trademark John Williams score (arguably the most well known score in the history of movies), and it's just a jump-out-of-your-skin moment. But, of course, I was expecting it to come, so I didn't exactly jump out of my skin. However, one moment I did forget made me do that: when Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss, giving the film's best performance) is pulling the shark teeth out of the hull of the boat and that corpse pops out. Cheap scare, definitely, but, man, was I ever wound up just for the fact that he chose to check that boat out in the water! There's a little to complain about, mostly the completely ridiculous behavior of the animal. It begins to act completely unnaturally, seeking revenge, when, no matter how large it may be, any animal's going to flee that kind of onslaught. I doubt a shark is even this smart, but that creature, at best, would assume that the boat itself was the danger, and since the boat is much bigger than it, it would swim the hell away. At least it's not like Jaws: The Revenge, where the shark, the offspring of the original shark from Jaws, swims to (what would be uninhabitable) Caribbean waters to take its revenge on Roy Scheider's son! This was definitely one of the best theatrical experiences I've ever had. A ball and a half!",10,1,4,19 March 2007
The Wrestler," Too familiar in its story to be a really great movie
","A small film about a big man. Mickey Rourke is, as you've certainly heard, outstanding as an aging wrestler who was famous back in the '80s and still plugs along at small events. Small those events may be, but they don't skip on the showmanship. One particularly brutal match rubs out the possibility of any more, and he has to take his life into perspective. He tries to reconnect with his estranged daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) and form a real relationship with a frequently-visited stripper (Marisa Tomei). Frankly, my opinion of the film is lower than that of most who have seen it. When The Wrestler focuses on wrestling, it's spectacular. It's very detail-oriented, and you can just sense how much Rourke, the big lug, loves it. And the aforementioned brutal match is sure to be one of the most shocking things you'll see in any 2008 film. I rarely am disturbed by what I see in a movie, but I was wincing hard at it. When the plot kicks in, though, I just found it to be utterly predictable. It's made out of three basic clichés: the old pro who desperately wants to re-achieve his former glory, the family member connecting with an estranged family member and the sex worker unsure of whether she should cross the line between her profession and her feelings. I could never get very excited about it, because I felt I knew exactly where it was going and I never was wrong.",7,2,4,11 January 2009
Hancock," The big twist completely ruins it
","This was a major disappointment. It's not that it looked like it was going to be fantastic and wasn't. No, the problem is that it was fantastic for about forty minutes, and then it became derailed so completely that it absolutely ruined all of my enjoyment. Will Smith, the king of the Forth of July, stars as a superhero. The gimmick: he's a screw-up and a drunk, and his heroic actions generally cause far more collateral damage than the actual problem he's trying to solve. The public hates him. One day he meets a down-on-his-luck PR expert (Jason Bateman) who has some ideas on how he can improve his image. It's a great premise, but the first thought you might have is, can they stretch it out to at least 90 minutes without breaking it? I honestly think the answer is yes, they could have. Their answer is, no, let's throw in an insanely idiotic twist that changes the film from a hilarious action-comedy to a dark, romantic superhero picture. I knew as soon as I saw Charlize Theron in the film that they were saving her character for some big twist, as the advertisements for the movie didn't include a single shot of her. You don't hire an actress that big and not give her something important to do. They had something so great here. The first half of it had me laughing out loud frequently. I've been waiting for Hollywood to skewer superhero movies intelligently ever since Batman Begins, where Batman's chase with the police causes millions of dollars of damage. I know it was pretty much universally hated, but My Super Ex-Girlfriend covered similar territory and, while it was never great, it didn't screw up anywhere near as royally as Hancock did.",5,17,30,6 July 2008
The Lion King," a bit mundane
","The Lion King, while being consistently entertaining, ends up being kind of disappointing by the end. The reasons for this are many and varied.First off, the film is very short. Only 88 minutes. I do not know why, but I thought that this film was supposed to be about 2 hours long. I think it is because I have always heard how much of an epic quality the film had. This is simply untrue. The film has very little in the way of script. Not much really happens in the film. You could probably sum up in only a couple of sentences.The characters and situations of the film are somewhat trite. It is unfair to dismiss this category of criticism because this a children's cartoon. The heroes and villains of other Disney films are much less formulaic, as well as the challenges they encounter (e.g., The Little Mermaid, Pinnochio, Beauty and the Beast).  Simba's challenge was a bit interesting, but, as I complained above, it is brought up and resolved in a half-hour's time. The only characters I found really interesting were the villains, and not Scar, but the Heyenas.It is this third complaint which actually pushed me into the realm of disliking this film: the music. I've always felt that the music of Disney's animated fare was bad. There are three exceptions I can think of offhand: The Little Mermaid, Pinnochio, and the Jungle Book. All other Disney animated films have a collection of some of the worst music that has ever been produced. I think The Lion King takes the cake for general rottenness in the music department. There was not one song that did not make me cringe.All in all, surely the Lion King is okay for kids, but there are so many better films, even from Disney's canon, that one should expose their children to. My suggestions are any of those Disney films I've listed as good above. As for non-Disney films, I think My Neighbor Totoro (age range 2-10, I would say) and Kiki's Delivery Service (age range 6-18; the best lessons ever of responsibility and self-reliance are found in this film), both from Japan but also both easily available in any video store dubbed into English, are the two best films for children ever made. Also, The Prince of Egypt is pretty good for slightly older children (I would put The Lion King in the 3-8 age range and The Prince of Egypt from 9-13). I give The Lion King 5/10 = good for children, pretty uninteresting to adults.",5,3,22,22 February 2001
Inception," The most fun I've had in the theater in a while
","Loved it. Too much of the criticism aimed at this film focuses on what it is not, which is a drama with complex characters. No, it doesn't flesh out any character besides DiCaprio's (and even his backstory seems to work more as plot than as an emotional core), but instead relies on its stars' personalities to quickly establish who they are without deeply exploring them. What the film is is a sci-fi thriller with elements of a heist picture, and it excels at what it does. Leonardo DiCaprio, along with partner Joseph Gordon-Levitt, play a couple of 'thieves' who specialize in stealing corporate secrets from their victims' dreams. One of their victims, Ken Watanabe, comes back to hire them to invade a competitor's dreams and implant an idea (a process known as inception, a concept many in the dream-invading field think is not possible, though DiCaprio knows it is). This introduces the heist element, where DiCaprio and Gordon-Levitt go around the world recruiting the best specialists to help them perform this difficult task (this is where Ellen Page, Tom Hardy and Dileep Rao come in). The six of them (including Watanabe) then set out to invade Cillian Murphy's dreams, which they can only do at the third level down (i.e., the dream within a dream within a dream). At this point, the film becomes sort of a maze with the group of characters dealing with four different levels of the dreamworld, each of which works on a different timescale. They discover Murphy has been trained to combat dream invaders (apparently a pretty well known threat in the movie's world), which takes the form of tons of faceless thugs coming after the dream team in each level of dream. Also threatening their mission is Marion Cotillard, a dream ghost from DiCaprio's past who always threatens to wreck his mind invasions. It seems more complicated than it is at first, but Nolan does a great job (despite occasionally relying too much on expository dialog) explaining how it all works. The film itself isn't exactly 'deep', but it's an intriguing and gripping experience. It's a rare experience to have this much fun in the theater. I think it only happens a few times in a decade.",10,7,25,19 July 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Guy Ritchie does his best to screw it up
","The first film of Guy Ritchie's that I've seen since his staggeringly awful debut, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (aka No Way! Shut Up! I've Never Even Seen Reservoir Dogs!). I was right to avoid him. Sherlock Holmes is almost a good movie. In any case, Robert Downey Jr. is an inspired choice for the role, and he really does his best to make the film work. I don't at all object to the idea of making Sherlock Holmes an action hero. The screenwriters make it make at least some sense. But, boy, does Ritchie go out of his way to screw everything up. The guy can't direct an action sequence to save his life. At one moment, he's overexplaining everything via slow-mo flashbacks (we could figure out Rachel McAdams drugged the wine, we don't need to see it), and another moment he's confusing us with slapdash editing. The film is just a mess. In the hands of a better director, this franchise could have been worth watching, but in Ritchie's hands, I'll avoid any subsequent films.",6,3,5,27 June 2010
WALL·E," Pretty much a masterpiece
","I honestly want to throw every superlative I can think of at this movie. I'm an unabashed Pixar fan, and have been since Toy Story 2, but I was a little disappointed in their last two films, Cars and Ratatouille. Both were good, very good at times, but I don't think they hit the level of what came before. To me, WALL-E is a return to form. No, that's too weak. It's their peak. No, that's wrong, too. A 'peak' implies that they're about to go down. I doubt that's true, although it's going to be hard to beat this one. WALL-E is my favorite of the Pixar films so far because I think it goes past the point of merely fantastic to that of being transcendent. It's a truly visionary film, one that inspired my jaw to drop over and over again. And it's intimate, too. It's hard to believe, but you're going to fall in love with a couple of robots when you watch the movie. And it's incredibly smart, too. Pixar has actually had this vein in most if not all of their movies, where they deliver moral lessons without any pandering whatsoever. The movie also contains deft social commentary. It's a pure joy to watch, and, without a doubt, one of the all-time great animated movies. Thank God for Pixar.",10,5,11,29 June 2008
Stalag 17," Ugh. Not a good film at all
","I hate when I hate classic movies. It doesn't happen too often, because I truly believe that most films that are known as classics ARE great films. But once in a while, I come upon one that seems like, to me, it was just randomly declared a masterpiece. Stalag 17 is one of the worst. Maybe if you had never heard of or seen Renoir's Grand Illusion, then it might seem worthwhile, but, in comparison, this film is a pile of manure. I did not laugh once, nor did I ever even crack a smile. The characters are of sitcom depth. In fact, the sitcom about a similar situation, Hogan's Heroes, has more depth (and more comedy) than this film. I wanted to murder the actor who played Animal throughout the whole movie. His mugging for the camera was painful to watch, as was his voice. The dialogue feels like it was written by a mechanic, it is so repetitive. And there is hardly an ounce of humanity to any character in this whole film...with one exception: William Holden. He delivers an excellent performance as a man wrongly accused of being a snitch. In fact, I despised every other character in the film, thinking that the Germans, even the German spy, had more integrity than they did. Alas, Holden has no chance to save this film. Those people who had falsely accuse him simply jump onto his bandwagon near the end of the film and they are supposed to be forgiven by the viewer? Holden's character only begins to develop realistically around the 70 minute mark. Up till then I was seriously debating whether or not to even finish this movie. I am not exactly glad that I did. 5/10.",5,16,32,21 July 2001
The Terminal," Good, but has too many weak parts.
","Definitely one of Spielberg's lesser efforts, one that might play at the 2 AM slot on TCM when he dies. One wonders why he took this project; it seems more like something Robert Zemeckis might knock off. There are a couple of moments of such amazingly poor writing that you wonder if Spielberg, or even Tom Hanks, even read that page of the script. However, most of the film is a decent human comedy. A man from a made-up Eastern European country lands at JFK airport and finds out that his government has been overthrown. His passport and visa are unacceptable, and no one knows what to do with him. The head of the airport (Stanley Tucci) orders him to wait in the airport while they figure something out, only they never do. Hanks becomes a permanent resident there, becomes friends with most of the little people who work in the airport, and even courts a pretty flight attendant whom he runs into now and then (Catherine Zeta-Jones). It's all pretty fun, and even at times quite romantic (there's also a subplot where Hanks helps a young food delivery man win the heart of a woman on the airport security staff that is kind of sweet). I also like the way the film celebrates the melting pot that makes up America. It's a nice picture in a time of ever-rising insularity. Yet there are so many bits holding the film back. The screenplay really needed some editing. Hanks carries around a peanut jar through the whole movie. We are told fairly early that it does not contain peanuts, and so the audience knows that a big surprise is coming. When we actually find out, it's quite lame, and, metaphorically, this part of the film just doesn't work. And, strangely, there's this one character who works a lot towards bringing the movie down a peg or two. The character of Gupta seems to ruin the movie. His backstory is melodramatic and not fit for this story, he's a paranoid, sadistic jerk (he is the janitor, and he washes the floors just so people will slip on them), and he provides the movie with the silliest deus ex machina imaginable. That's not to mention the actor, Kumar Pallana, is a horrible actor. This film is actually inspired by the true story of an Iranian man who became stranded at a Parisian airport after his briefcase, which contained his passport and everything he owned, was stolen. The original story is much more interesting than The Terminal. A movie has already been made in France about it, but it hasn't been seen much outside of that country. I think the real story would make a great film. 7/10.",7,0,5,28 June 2004
Rango," Great looking, decent story, but could stand to be funnier
","Worth seeing mostly for the visuals. It's awesome how bizarre these characters are. I sincerely hope they frighten children (reports from the movie's message board say that there were a lot of young children weeping when the rattlesnake character appears). Animated films are often far too cutesy, and this is a breath of fresh air in that way. The story is not especially great, but it's passable. It's a Western about a pet chameleon (voiced (kind of poorly) by Johnny Depp) who gets lost in the Mojave and ends up in a small town. After some accidental heroics, he becomes sheriff. A local lizard girl (voiced (quite well) by Isla Fisher) persuades him to look into the current drought after she finds evidence of water being dumped in the middle of the desert. If that sounds familiar, it's because that whole mystery plot is cribbed from Chinatown. That doesn't bother me at all, and the mystery is relatively complex for a kid's movie. My major complaint about Rango is that the humor very rarely works. The script is just not very funny. If it wasn't supposed to be, that would be fine, but they're clearly going for laughs (and failing).",7,5,9,6 March 2011
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Excellent
","A (moslty) single-shot movie in the vein of Hitchcock's Rope (there's even a sly reference to it right near the beginning), this film stars Michael Keaton as a washed-up Hollywood actor, famous for playing superhero Birdman, trying to regain his clout by starring in a Raymond Carver adaptation (which he wrote) on Broadway. As the film opens, one of his co-stars is injured on set (thankfully, as far as Keaton's concerned), and he replaces him with famous but difficult stage star Edward Norton, who proceeds to throw the show into complete chaos. Other characters include Keaton's lawyer/manager/best friend Zach Galafianakis, his daughter Emma Stone, his other co-stars Naomi Watts (Norton's girlfriend) and Andrea Riseborough (Keaton's own girlfriend), as well as Amy Ryan, Keaton's ex-wife. Keaton is also stalked by the disembodied (at least at the start) voice of his character Birdman, who taunts him and urges him to do awful things. This is a high wire act, and it's pulled off beautifully. Sure, it's a bit stagy and a bit pretentious (as are all of Iñárritu's films), but, because of the setting, it works. It also helps that all the performances are so great, and it's aided immeasurably by the cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki. I also like the mostly drum score by Antonio Sanchez, which gives the whole thing a jittery feel. I wasn't quite sold on the ending. It may have been foreshadowed thoroughly, but it just didn't quite work for me. I don't mind that they broke away from the one shot for the epilogue, but I don't like the way they did it. An excellent film, though, most certainly.",9,10,24,2 November 2014
Centurion," Dull, ugly and mostly forgettable
","Director Neil Marshall showed a lot of promise with his sophomore feature, The Descent. It was far from perfect, but it was a rare horror movie that was actually frightening. Marshall has unfortunately not advanced any since then. His followup, Doomsday, was an okay B movie, but it was most definitely forgettable. Centurion, his fourth movie (I never have caught up with his debut, Dog Soldiers), is even worse than Doomsday. It's a story about a group of Roman soldiers, led by Michael Fassbender, caught behind enemy lines, trying to make their way to Hadrian's Wall before the Picts, led by mute tracker Olga Kurlyenko, hunt down and kill them. When it's nothing but running and chasing, it ain't half bad. Anything resembling plot, though, stinks. I could barely understand the mush-mouthed Brits that populate the movie (apparently the Romans were made up of Cockney bootblacks), and when the Picts are subtitled, the font and color of the subtitles are illegible. The film has that awful processed blue tint throughout, and the action is edited in such a way that it's often hard to follow (also: CGI blood).",5,3,8,6 December 2010
The Big Short," Some of it was beyond my understanding, but I still really liked it
","Comedic director Adam McKay (best known for his collaborations with Will Ferrell, like Anchorman, Talladega Nights and Step Brothers) makes a foray into drama (though with plenty of comedic touches) with this film about the American housing collapse of the mid-2000s. The story has a great structure, with three different sets of people who were at the forefront of predicting the crisis and hope to make money off of it. Christian Bale is the first to see it. Later, banker Ryan Gosling catches wind of Bale's odd investments and figures it out. He accidentally alerts Steve Carell, and then has to team up with Carell and his crew. Third, a couple of young hedge fund managers (John Magaro and Finn Wittrock) hear about it and team up with former neighbor Brad Pitt to get in on the action. The problem with me here is that this is a subject I have a hard time grasping. McKay, however, is great at making it all understandable, or at least halfway so, and he's definitely great at making it all involving and entertaining. The entire ensemble is great. I'd name Bale the best in show, and I'm not usually a big Bale fan. Personally, I'd hold this up against Spotlight, which is similar in a lot of ways (you might think of the characters here as journalists trying to figure this all out), and say this is the way to make a film like this well. McKay's direction isn't overly showy, either, but he makes this exciting and interesting. Much of this is through the editing, which is some of the best of the year. I left Spotlight thinking, 'Eh, that's too bad.' I left The Big Short feeling angry.",8,0,0,5 January 2016
Prometheus," Majorly flawed, with some very poorly written characters, but overall a very entertaining, genuinely frightening sci-fi/horror flick
","Despite a number of glaring flaws, Ridley Scott's long-awaited return to science fiction is excellent. A sort of prequel to Alien, this film stars Noomi Rapace as an archaeologist who has discovered a number of star maps in cave paintings. She convinces a corporation (run by a dying Guy Pearce in old man makeup) to bankroll a space voyage in search of those who she believes engineered the human race. For the record, one of the major flaws is that there is absolutely no reason for her or her boyfriend, Logan Marshall-Green, to think this, and they give Rapace an ill-defined religious background that just never makes any sense. On this expedition, among many, are Charlize Theron, the representative of the corporation, Idris Elba, the captain and Michael Fassbender as the android who, much like Ian Holm in the original Alien, may have a hidden agenda. The expedition discovers a pyramid and they go exploring. The civilization is the one who built the ship where the crew of the Nostromo discovered the aliens, but this film is not about xenomorphs. While the structure of the film is much like Alien - after all, it's a sci-fi horror film - it mostly feels like its own thing. The biggest problem is that it introduces a lot of characters and concepts and has to deal with them all really quickly. I don't know that I'd say that I would want to see a cut that ran an hour longer, but they really needed it to ratchet up the suspense and make the character motivations make more sense. The one thing I really do like about the film is that so much of it remains delightfully unexplained - I know it's cliché to bring up Lovecraft when discussing a horror film, but the horrors of Prometheus really do feel Lovecraftian - they are often unseen, the way things morph into other things. We never really understand the motivations of the race they discover, just that whatever they were doing did not work out too well for them. It's all really creepy. Of course, the script was co-written by Damon Lindelof, one of the major artists behind Lost, so that sense of unsolvable mystery is definitely in his wheelhouse. The actors are all fine, though this is definitely more of a showpiece for production designers and special effects workers. Technically, it's about perfect. Between this and The Avengers, this has already been a really good summer for movies (okay, we'll just forget that Battleship exists - it'll be forgotten anyway). I saw it in 3D which, as always, was worthless. I can't keep letting people talk me into that!",8,4,16,11 June 2012
Carrie," Conflicted, but it works
","I am usually one who has little problem deciding how I feel about a movie. Carrie is a rare movie that completely conflicts me. A good half of the movie I found excellent. The other half I found execrable. I was highly suspicious right from the second scene, where the camera pans through a high school girls' locker room in slow motion, and no detail is spared. Okay, so none of the girls in the film were under 25, but that doesn't take away from the fact that they're supposed to be 18 and under and we can see their naked breasts and even pubic hair. This is very bothersome. And then we find the source of the title character's problems: her religious zealot of a mother, played by Piper Laurie. This role is so poorly written, and so poorly performed that it veers very close to being hugely offensive. Even if not offensive, it's annoyingly one-dimensional and adds absolutely no depth to the picture. And then there's the climactic sequence. If you haven't seen the film, egregious SPOILERS follow. I've always known how this film turns out, for the most part (I had never heard about the ultra-religious mother, which is probably wisely kept a secret by the film's fans). I expected the whole film to be little more than a revenge fantasy, and I was mostly correct. I especially didn't like the scene where Travolta and Nancy Allen got killed, despite the fact that I've always secretly wanted to see John Travolta die in an exploding car. But it would have been better to let them survive, to allow some of the guilt exist on with them (they had already escaped the prom, so it almost seems like they were supposed to live). Yet the actual climactic scene in the high school gym is not merely a revenge fantasy. If it were, the audience would be allowed to enjoy the violence and take part in the joy of it, which is the way revenge fantasies generally work. But, no, our emotions are purposely conflicted when Carrie ends up killing several people who neither meant harm to her nor did harm to her. She even kills her gym teacher (Betty Buckley), who is more benign to her than any other character in the film, brutally and intentionally. These deaths were not playing into the audience's desire, but rather worked against it, raising uncomfortable questions.Unfortunately, we then have to follow Carrie home. On the way, she kills those who did her, and, consequently, everyone else, the most harm, and that is a death scene we're meant to revel in. Then she gets to have revenge on the cartoon character of her mother (who speaks with a fake Southern accent because anyone who would be that into Jesus would have to be a Southerner, I guess), where she dies in the same position as Carrie's demonic-looking Christ figurine, a ham-fisted attempt at satire. Along the way De Palma foolishly throws in his entire bag of tricks, which don't really encompass anything that Hitchcock hadn't perfected years earlier, and perhaps even fall far short of what Hitchcock could achieve, and he has composer Pino Donaggio write what has to be one of the worst musical scores of all time. It frequently steals the sharp violin notes that punctuate Janet Leigh's death in Psycho, and uses them in an incredibly inept manner, at that.And then, and then the film has such a remarkably knowing center, the cruelty and pain of a young girl's existence in high school. Throughout the movie, so many perfect notes are hit, from the embarrassment Carrie feels when her gym teacher, either thinking the girl can't hear her or forgetting the fact that she can, is telling the principal about Carrie's period (hey, maybe that's why she gets crushed at the end!), to the way Carrie refuses Tommy when he first asks her to the prom, to the beautiful spinning dance  not so much the actual dance, which is another of De Palma's moments of unneeded inventiveness, but the sweet, natural dialogue between Tommy and Carrie. At that point we don't know yet that Tommy and his girlfriend, Sue, aren't in on the prank, but Tommy's dialogue sounds so unforced that I was unsure of whether he was just an exceptional actor (William Katt does an excellent job in the role) or whether he might actually like Carrie. I found myself actively hoping for the latter and, though we never do find out the exact truth of the matter, I was at least relieved that it wasn't the former, or at least that the act he was putting on wasn't an act of unadulterated cruelty (perhaps, at the most, unintentional cruelty). In the middle of this mess of a film is the beautiful, brilliant, powerful performance by Sissy Spacek. She was a decade or more older than the character she was playing, but she captures that look of a tortured teenage soul with those cavernous, blue eyes and the hangdog lips. And she gives such perfect readings of her lines. Spacek breaks my heart with every word she says in the movie, even during the bad scenes with Piper Laurie. And knowing what awaits Carrie at the prom makes some of the film almost unbearable emotionally. As many problems as I had with the film, I had tears in my eyes through most of it. Indeed, I was very involved with the film emotionally through its entire run. When, in Sue's dream sequence in the end of the film, an event occurs that would have been entirely predictable  even if this was the first time it had ever happened (which I doubt anyway), I was startled, badly. I, who claim to recognize nearly every cinematic trick and cliché in the book. And I sat there and chastised myself in my mind for being that gullible. But the simple fact was that it made me jump. That's higher praise than I can give a good number of the best films.",10,2,5,22 July 2003
1408," Decently entertaining up until the end, but then it just gets dumb
","The least good film I've seen so far from 2007, but that's mostly because I've been lucky and have avoided things that looked particularly awful. In reality, 1408 is just mediocre. John Cusack stars and basically owns the screen for its 94 minutes as an author who writes about hauntings. He doesn't himself believe in the stuff he writes about, but is glad to fleece a gullible audience. But when he discovers room 1408 in the Dolphin Hotel in New York City, he has met his match. It is haunted, and apparently by a semi-talented Hollywood FX crew that doesn't know the meaning of the phrase 'less is more'. Hollywood just doesn't realize that loud effects are not especially scary. Ghost stories in particular are at their best when they're quiet and spooky. That said, much of the film falls into the category of a decent afternoon at the movies. Cusack, a favorite of mine, is very good throughout. The early scenes between him and Samuel L. Jackson, who has a rather tiny role as the manager of the hotel, are particularly good. The two play off each other perfectly (the best part of the movie comes later on when a tiny Sam Jackson appears in John Cusack's mini-bar  not meant to be funny, but it's hilarious). The haunting scenes happen too quickly and come on too heavily, but there are a couple of moments that made me jump. And there's a moderately clever mislead near the end of the film (which is obvious, especially if you've seen the trailer, but which works for the most part). But the climax and end are incredibly bad, ruining even the small amount of fun I had had. Before I finish, I have one complaint about something else that really bothered me: what the heck was with the digital ghosts? The ghosts look like some sort of digital holograms. How is this in any way frightening? It just looked odd.",5,11,20,24 June 2007
The Iron Giant," A Lesson that Ought to be Learned by American Animators
","Don't get me wrong, I did really enjoy this film, but it is also a good example of why I think American animation is far inferior to Japanese animation. And I am talking solely about the animation (i.e., character design, movement, and scenery), not the story complexity. There is no doubt that the stories of Japanese animated films are more complex than those of American animated films. The Iron Giant's story is basically taken straight from E.T.Anyhow, watch how mannered the designs of the characters' faces are in this film. Check out how large Hogarth's ears are. And check out how exaggerated the characters' movements are. This becomes staggeringly unrealistic very quickly. It begins to look, well, just plain goofy. People don't really look like this. They don't make these sorts of expressions.People always complain about the eye size of Japanese anime characters. Their eyes are big for a simple reason which was stated in ancient Rome by the neo-Platonist philosopher Plotinus: the eyes are the windows of the soul. The sculptors of the later Roman Empire always made the eyes on statues enormous, just like the Japanese animators do. Most human expression comes from the eyes, so Japanese animators made the eyes on their characters bigger.What most critics of the Japanese anime eye-size have failed to notice is how large the American animators have made the eyes on their characters. The Americans are obviously learning something from the Japanese. Disney animators have said that there is not a work day that goes by where they do not watch parts of films by Hayao Miyazaki. These films have influenced them greatly. But what American animators have missed in the Japanese animation is that the other pieces of their characters' faces are extremely downplayed. Their mouths, ears, and nose are all very small. Humans express much less in these areas of their faces than the characters of American animated films. This over-exaggeration has occurred in all Disney movies after The Little Mermaid, The Iron Giant, The Road to El Dorado, and I can even see that this is a problem in the upcoming animated flick Titan A.E. It is a big problem, and it must be solved.As for the film itself, after I got around those technicalities, I was quite touched. I liked the anti-violence theme a lot. I think it is a very good film for children. I give it an 8/10.",8,0,2,31 May 2000
Mary and Max," Sloppy clash of moods, but it's genuinely touching at times and certainly worth a watch
","An Australian stop-motion animated film about a dumpy little girl (voiced by Toni Collette) who randomly chooses a name in a New York phone book and writes him a letter. The man on the other side (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is an obese, middle-aged Jew with Asperger's Syndrome. Neither of these people have friends in real life, and they soon become each other's only friends. This is a rather sad story, filmed in a very muted color scheme. The New York sequences, in particular, are almost black and white. The Australian sequences have a lot of brown in them. Writer/director Elliot (claiming he based it on a true story) injects a lot of quirky humor into the picture, almost making it seem like an Aardman product at times. The big difference between this and Aardman: the animators of Mary & Max go out of their way to make everything hideously ugly. There's a big mental disconnect between all of these elements. It wants to be depressing, it wants to be charming, it wants to be hilarious, it wants to be freakish. Fortunately, it does succeed enough of the time where it's well worth watching. At its heart, there's a very touching story. I do not think this deserves to be mentioned alongside the slew of wonderful animated films of the year, except maybe for a footnote.",7,8,18,7 February 2010
Shrek," make it stop!!!
","I first saw this movie on opening day, laughed about five times during the film, mostly at Eddie Murphy, and then left the theater and forgot about it. I sat at my computer, and wrote the following review for imdb: 'This film was four years in the making, and they should have scrapped it long, long ago. In a few months, it will be little but an embarassing memory when faced up to Final Fantasy. The animation is bad, and the voice acting is even worse. Mike Meyers' faux Scottish accent is annoying. I have one more suggestion: why only three Smashmouth songs? Why not an entire album? 5/10.'I dismissed it instantly, thinking that it would please small children who still think fart jokes are the pinnacle of humor and then fade into obscurity. Unfortunately, I was dead wrong, and I have no idea why. It is a bad film, I cannot get around that. As many times as I go through it in my mind, it is bad. I did laugh, but not very much. I was more appalled at the potty humor, something which critics and audiences alike flip out over all the time (I rarely do), but everyone seems to be impervious to them in this film. Nothing about the story was original. The climactic scene is copied straight out of Beauty and the Beast, except with a twist which is not one one-hundredth as clever as everyone seems to think it is.
And here's another slap in the face: the animation is not great. No, not at all. Even those who seem to dislike the film on these comment boards tend to praise the animation. Have they not seen the Toy Story movies or A Bug's Life? The animation in those films is infinitely better. Heck, even Small Soldiers surpassed this one by thousands of miles. I would rather watch Toy Story 2 a hundred times than watch five minutes of Shrek's dreck one more time. Also, if you have even seen the briefest clip of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, the so-called 'realistic' animation of Shrek looks as much like a cartoon as the human characters from Pokemon. Heck, even the characters from Toy Story look more like human beings than the characters of Shrek, AND THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TOYS!Shrek is obviously going to have one of the highest grosses of the year, if not the highest. The world is a truly deranged place. I live in a world of children who have taken over and now run the day care center.",5,2,4,29 June 2001
Shrek," Just bad

The Silence of the Lambs," After Titanic, the most worthless Best Picture winner of the 1990s
","What is so special about this film? I've watched it once, about a year ago, and could never figure it out myself. What I saw was a pretty good thriller which bombed out at the very end. I never thought the acting was all that great either. I think Anthony Hopkins was overacting, and I thought it was one of Jodie Foster's slightest performances. She had a more complex character in Freaky Friday. Oh, and the end that I mentioned above (I guess SPOILERS):
Jodie Foster just stumbles on Buffalo Bob while following her clues. It seemed believable to me that she might come upon him before she actually new exactly who she was confronting. But it also made the film seem rushed to actually have the final showdown as soon as she accidentally runs into Buffalo Bob. It almost seemed to me as if they decided that the movie was too long at that point, and that they should just let this coincidence develop into a finale, even if it was premature. If you don't understand what I am talking about, that is, if you thought the film ended at the correct time, read Roger Ebert's review of the film. I did not develop my opinion from his review either, he  just confirmed my suspicions. I don't think Silence of the Lambs was particularly fascinating elsewhere, but it was often entertaining. I would have given it a 7/10, but the sloppy ending knocks it down to a 6/10. Jesus, how did the Academy remember this at awards time. 1992 must have been a slow year.",7,8,21,21 August 2000
The Wolverine," A bore
","Hugh Jackman is fine in the role, as always, and some of the action sequences are good (though I hated the fight on top of the bullet train - it struck me as incredibly stupid), but the story is fairly cliché and there's just no flow. The story has Wolverine summoned to Japan to say goodbye to an old acquaintance whose life he saved in WWII (Hal Yamanouchi). There he gets pulled into a web of intrigue and ninjas. Rila Fukushima provides able support as a red haired martial artist with superior sword skills. Tao Okamoto is pretty but dull as the love interest. Svetlana Khodchenkova is embarrassingly bad as a prostitute, er, doctor who is also not very secretly an evil mutant. She feels way out of place. Marvel has done such a good job with their Avengers franchise, and the last X-Men movie was pretty good, but this is a dud. A lot of the critics who liked it liked it specifically because it separated this hero from his milieu, and I think that's partly why I didn't like it much at all.",5,6,13,4 August 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," A good conclusion to the trilogy
","A satisfying conclusion to Nolan's Batman trilogy. I don't love these films as some do, but I appreciate what they're trying to do, and I definitely enjoy them. The Dark Knight Rises doesn't have anything nearly as captivating as Heath Ledger's Joker character, but it makes up for it by being better plotted and by perhaps having a somewhat more interesting Batman/Bruce Wayne characterization than the previous two films. I definitely think this is Christian Bale's best performance in the trilogy (I'm generally not a big fan of his). This film takes place eight years after The Dark Knight. Laws enacted upon the death of Harvey Dent have solved Gotham's organized crime problem (and apparently in Nolan's universe crazy supervillains either don't exist in such great quantities or Arkham Asylum has much better security than in other Batman universes), and Batman has retired. Bruce Wayne has more or less become a shut-in and Wayne Enterprises isn't doing so well financially. New crime begins to creep in from the corporate world. One particularly sleazy CEO has hired a masked mercenary, Bane (Thomas Hardy), to help him commit his crimes. Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), whom I don't think they ever actually referred to as 'Catwoman,' is also employed for certain crimes. Neither Bane nor Kyle are loyal to their employer. Bane, in fact, has a terrorist plan to take over Gotham City, and it's up to Batman to fight him. Unfortunately, Batman is somewhat crippled by his earlier adventures, and, even if not, he would be hopelessly outclassed by the muscle-bound hulk (this being Nolan's Batman, Bane is not enhanced by VENOM, the chemical that made him a monster in the original comics). Marion Cotillard also appears as a wealthy socialite in whom Bruce Wayne puts his trust. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays a smart cop who rises to the position of detective after saving Jim Gordon's life. The plot is quite complex - I'm not sure if it made total sense. The pace is more deliberate than The Dark Knight, but it's no less gripping and exciting. There were a few cringe-worthy sequences, but it mostly works.",8,2,5,23 July 2012
Iron Man," Moderately entertaining, but not much more
","A good superhero movie, but I'm more than a little shocked at the insanely good reviews it's gotten. Perhaps I'm just getting sick of the superhero movie formula, at least the initial installments of them. Same old same old, really. The only real positive element of the movie is Robert Downey Jr., who plays himself as he pretty much always does. If you don't like the actor, you'll find the movie torturous. I love him, personally, and was happy enough watching him do his thing with a few big action sequences adding some spice. And you've got to appreciate the casting of Jeff 'the Dude' Bridges as a super villain (kind of a spoiler, I suppose, but if you don't see that coming you're a bonehead). Favreau finds a way to make Bridges enormous and intimidating in every shot, even while riding a Segway, which is a triumph of some sort. But, really, what does Iron Man provide that no other superhero movie has before? I certainly don't see it. The character is actually pretty boring, as are all the supporting characters. Are we now raving merely because of competency?",7,5,10,4 May 2008
Monsters University," Not great, but totally fun
","A prequel to one of Pixar's most beloved films, Monsters Inc. In all honesty, I wasn't looking forward to this one too much. A sequel would have been a better option. Like the Toy Story movies, it should take place a long while later, and Mike and Sully should meet back up with a teenage Boo or something. Boo was the soul of that movie, and, of course, in a prequel, Boo can't exist. Instead, we get the story of how Mike and Sully met in college. The story is made up of a ton of college movie clichés in the Monsters world. And it's fine. Not great, nothing really special, but it's very enjoyable and the animation is gorgeous. The last time I revisited Monsters Inc., the animation seemed a little primitive, but Pixar has more than perfected it now, and I loved seeing the wonderful monster designs. Steve Buscemi, the villain from the first film, is prominent in the cast again. Other famous cast members include Nathan Fillion, Sean Hayes, Dave Foley, Charlie Day, Aubrey Plaza and Alfred Molina. The most memorable new character is Dean Hardscrabble, played by Helen Mirren. The design, kind of a centipede dragon, is extremely cool and actually pretty creepy.",7,9,13,23 June 2013
Ben-Hur," Weak with a couple of great set pieces and one great performance
","For a long while, I've described Ben-Hur as the biggest film that I had not yet seen. Now I have. This is one of those classics whose status has been fading with time, and it's no wonder once you've seen the film. Sure, there are a few scenes that are very memorable, and have become part of our common culture. Who can forget the scenes where Judah Ben-Hur is a slave in the galleys, rowing fiercely as the weaker slaves collapse around him? The music in this scene is what I find particularly memorable. And then there's the chariot race, which I think cements this film as one that is worth seeing more than any other. I also like how the story is constructed, as a side story to the life of Jesus. Christ pops up every once in a while. Early in the film, there is a memorable scene where Christ defies a Roman soldier and gives the parched Ben-Hur water. When the soldier tries to reprimand him, a quick look from Jesus silences him completely. Unfortunately, a whole hell of a lot of the film is very forgettable. Each scene seems to take 25% longer than it really needs to  not only are the scenes protracted far beyond their limitations, but the actors stumble slowly through their lines, as if each and every syllable was carrying the cross on its back. It gets old, and quick. The film has very little passion as it lumbers along. Most of the direction seems lackluster. Big, but mostly lacking heart. William Wyler directed one of the most emotionally touching films of all time, Mrs. Miniver, an utterly intimate affair that will stay with me forever. Ben-Hur often just sat there without trying to connect to the audience at all. The acting itself is generally weak. Charlton Heston's performance is certainly not among his best. I actually like him as an actor, but I don't think it's very good here. To be fair, his performance gets better as the film moves along. Ben-Hur's moral dilemma is intriguing, and as his desire for revenge and violence did ultimately touch me. Many of the other performances are just bad  the one that comes immediately to mind is Haya Harareet as Esther, the slave girl whom Ben-Hur loves and later marries. Martha Scott and Cathy O'Donnell, who play his mother and sister respectively, are too dull to really care too much what happens to them. And I'm disappointed in Sam Jaffe, whom I love as an actor in films such as The Scarlet Empress and Gunga Din. I didn't even recognize him, he has so little energy in this film. Hugh Griffith won an Oscar for playing a sheik, but his character is not memorable at all. The only actor who really hits a home run is Stephen Boyd as Messala, Ben-Hur's childhood friend, now his bitterest enemy. He really projects his inner turmoil. Overall, I say that I am glad that I saw this finally. It may have not worked very well, but I was generally entertained. Not moved at all, but it was nice to watch (and a lot more fun to criticize!). Only the chariot sequence and a couple of Messala's scenes did anything more than that for me. 6/10.",7,13,29,14 July 2002
Casino Royale," Enjoyable, but hardly anything to go nuts over
","To me, Bond movies are very low on the cinematic totem pole, occupying the space right above Elvis movies and right below non-Pixar CGI talking animal movies. The new Casino Royale has been hailed as a reinvention of the series, and in some ways it is. It loses most of the high-tech gadgets and takes itself a bit more seriously than its immediate, Pierce Brosnan-starring predecessors (which I'll admit are the only ones I'm really familiar with, with the single exception of Dr. No). But honestly, the differences have been exaggerated. It still relies heavily on huge action set-pieces with drawn-out chases and loud explosions. It's very much an action movie of the current generation, and in no way represents anything trailblazing, in Bond or anything else. The story may be more down to Earth and more complex (or complicated), but the action sequences are just as ludicrous as anything you'll find in your average summer blockbuster. Plus, the thing runs on forever, a ridiculous two and a half hours, and there are long stretches where I was getting rather bored (especially during the completely unbelievable and uncharacteristic sub-plot where James Bond falls in love). It does have its good points. Eva Green is chief among them, as the most interesting woman Bond has ever been involved with, and by far the best actress that I've ever seen in the series. The villain, played by Mads Mikkelsen, is also quite good, though perhaps too reminiscent in his appearance of some of the earlier Bond villains like Dr. No and Auric Goldfinger. Judi Dench is the only returning actor, and she's wonderful as always. Also Jeffrey Wright, packing a fun surprise, and good ol' Giancarlo Giannini  nice to see he's still kicking! And Daniel Craig? Well, he's great. But so was Brosnan. The filmmakers involved with Brosnan just gave him crap to work with, and I guarantee you the same thing will happen to Craig. Casino Royale is definitely better than all of Brosnan's Bond films, but only by a slight margin. Remove Denise Richards as a nuclear scientist from The World Is Not Enough (and the line 'I thought Christmas only came once a year'  one of the biggest howlers of all time) and that movie would have been just as serious and dramatic as this one is, and just as good. And neither would be as good as either of the Bourne movies, and, sadly, for 2006 movies Casino Royale comes in second behind another spy thriller, Mission: Impossible III. There are similar scenes in both films where the heroes have to shock themselves to stay alive. That scene in M:I:III is a hundred times more well done than the one here. Despite my complaints, I do think the film works perfectly fine as popcorn-munching entertainment, but to suggest that it's anything more than that is frankly laughable. One last note: this film ought to have been rated R. It's too violent to be PG-13.",7,6,10,4 December 2006
Toy Story 3," Exceptional, of course.
","Pixar is unstoppable. Heck, I'm even anticipating Cars 2 (which they are making, alongside Monsters Inc. 2). About the only thing I didn't like too much was the film's villain, who is pretty much an echo of the villain from the previous Toy Story movie. He even suffers pretty much the same fate. Otherwise, this is just masterful. Andy, the toys' owner, is now 17 and about to head off for college. He is forced to decide what to do with his old toys. Throw them away, donate them to a local day care or store them away in the attic? He chooses the latter option (except for Woody, whom he chooses to take with him), but, through a series of misunderstandings, they get set on the curb. They narrowly escape, and decide to jump into the donation box. At first, the day care seems like heaven on Earth: it doesn't matter that these kids will grow up, because a whole new set of kids is always arriving. Unfortunately, there is a pretty cruel society between the toys that has been established at the day care. Buzz and Andy's other toys are left to be destroyed by toddlers who treat them roughly. The stuffed bear Lotso (Ned Beatty) and his minions rule from a room full of grade schoolers. Meanwhile, Woody, who got trapped in the car and ended up donated, as well, tries to make his way back. On his way, he discovers the truth about the day care and goes back to rescue them. The film contains the same feelings and themes of the previous movies, but it has a somewhat more somber tone to it. Of course, it's mainly an adventure film, and it's extremely exciting. The escape from the day care ranks among the great escape movies (unlike Chicken Run, which just feels like a cheap parody of them). At the end of the film's climax there is a bit that is so emotionally overwhelming that it'll probably be remembered as one of Pixar's best moments ever, right next to the Carl and Ellie sequence that opens Up, the final moment in Monsters Inc. or the space walk in Wall-E. In my mind, the whole relationship between Barbie (a donated toy that belonged to Andy's little sister) and the Ken doll she meets at the day care is one of the funniest things ever. The Ken character (voiced by Michael Keaton) is especially hilarious when putting on a fashion show for Barbie. He might well be my favorite character in the entire series.",9,2,3,20 June 2010
Before Sunrise," One of the best films of the 1990s
","I had never heard of this film before a couple of weeks ago, but its concept interested me when I heard it: an American man meets a European woman on his last night in Europe and they spend the night together talking. It sparked my interest, but I never expected it to be this great. Before Sunrise is a masterpiece, and it's also one of the most romantic films on record. To my surprise, it completely lacked the cynicism of the 1990s. It's impossible to really talk too much about it, since there is no real plot, so to speak (although there are plenty of thoroughly interesting things you could talk about; it is sort of like My Dinner With Andre, where there is a conversation, but it's not JUST the conversation that matters), but let me just say, see it. SEE IT!",10,136,177,8 February 2001
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Dull, but the story's not bad and the performances are good
","The latest Woody flick is set in Spain, where friends Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) both get involved with an artist (Javier Bardem). Both women sleep with Bardem, but eventually Johansson ends up with him. Hall goes back to her boring finacé, though her brief affair has distorted her view of her life. Meanwhile, Johansson has to deal with Bardem's crazy ex-wife (Penelope Cruz), who is invited back home after a suicide attempt. The story, though perhaps overcomplicated, is a good one. Unfortunately, Allen kind of spoils it by including a bland voice-over narration that over-explains the plot. The narration distances the audience from the action, and the film started to drag for me. And in the end, it felt like nothing much had happened. I didn't care and I doubt the movie will remain long in my memory. However, that's not to say that it's a bad movie. It's a moderate failure for the long-suffering Allen, but it's a success for most of the actors. In particular, I think Penelope Cruz's performance should be considered award-worthy. It'll probably be worth catching on DVD, but I wouldn't especially recommend you be in any rush.",7,1,8,18 August 2008
Fantastic Mr. Fox," A lot of weaknesses, but it's pleasant and kind of beautiful at times
","Wes Anderson becomes an animation director while retaining his signature visual style. The stop-motion animation itself is intentionally crude and old fashioned, almost like an episode of Gumby, and it has a charm. One wonders whether the younger generation will accept it or not. Some kids in the theater behind me certainly didn't, and were fidgeting throughout the movie. That may not have just been due to the animation style, though, as it's not really aimed for kids so much as Wes Anderson fans. Based on the book by Roald Dahl but presumably barely resembling it, George Clooney voices Mr. Fox, a former bird thief forced to give it up by his wife (Meryl Streep) after they are nearly captured. Twelve years later and saddled by a son (Jason Schwartzman) and a new mortgage, Mr. Fox decides that he's had enough of the safe life and decides to pilfer from three nearby and very dangerous farmers. In retaliation, the farmers attack the entire animal community in the forest where Mr. Fox lives. I haven't read the Dahl book, but most of Fantastic Mr. Fox's best moments are definitely Wes Anderson moments, with perfectly chosen music and semi-awkward dialogue and petty character conflict. The plot of the film is really not Anderson's interest, which does lead to problems later in the film. As a children's story, Fantastic Mr. Fox at least in part relies on action, and Anderson is just not an action director. His set-ups are confusing and often make little sense. As the film goes through its climax, it gets considerably weaker than when the characters were just standing around conversing. All in all, it's far from a great movie, and perhaps in reality it isn't even that good of one. But there is a lot of beauty in it, and I love the handcrafted feel. I'd marginally recommend it, though I'd say you have to at least in part be a fan of Wes Anderson.",8,3,6,13 December 2009
Live Free or Die Hard," Extraordinarily silly, but pretty fun
","This afterthought, coming a full 12 years after the third Die Hard movie and 19 years after the original, was destined to be not as good as its predecessors. I mean, after the first one, the people responsible for the sequels were obsessed with packing them more and more full of action. In the new one, the strategy of its filmmakers is to make a movie about 100 times as action-packed as the original. With this much augmentation, the action sequences cross the line from gripping to just plain ridiculous. In this one, guys shooting automatic weapons at John MacLane are just a joke. Easy stuff, really. The only challenge there is to keep the computer hacker (Justin Long) he's protecting alive, and even that's not much of a challenge. It only gets decently difficult when a jet fighter is chasing him, firing missiles and super-duper machine guns at him while he drives along crumbling elevated highways in a lumbering semi. Yeah, it's silly. But that doesn't make it bad. It's at least amusingly silly. Bruce Willis hasn't lost any of the charisma he brought into the first three movies. Justin Long is the comic relief, and at first I thought he would be really annoying. But he's fairly funny most of the time. I absolutely loved the main henchman and lover of the villain, played by icy half-Asian Maggie Q, last seen in Mission: Impossible III. There's also an amusing cameo by Kevin Smith. I'm not sure what to think about the villain, played by Timothy Olyphant. At first, he bugged me, but as the film went on, I started to like his demeanor and shiny white teeth. I think he was suitably creepy. However, I think they missed a golden opportunity to make a better movie: since Justin Long is probably best known as the hip kid playing the Mac guy in a series of entertaining television commercials, they really should have cast the PC guy as the villain. Sure, it would have been ultra-jokey, but the film is already so silly, I think it would have been especially awesome.",8,0,3,15 July 2007
Moonrise Kingdom," Wes Anderson's best? No, I don't think so, but it's very enjoyable
","A sweet little picture. It's Wes Anderson through and through, and if you are a fan, you'll like it a lot, I suspect. Set in the '60s, it concerns two pre-teens (Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward) who conspire to run away together on an adventure on the remote island of New Penzance. Gilman, an orphan, is pursued by his fellow Khaki Scouts and their scoutmaster (Edward Norton). Hayward's parents, whose marriage is dissolving, are played by Bill Murray and Francis MacDormand. Bruce Willis plays the policeman on the island. Gilman and Hayward are adorable, but, God help me, by far my biggest problem with the film is that they are poor actors. Their love story is really touching, and it feels like it should be one for the ages, but the performances kept pushing me away. I just could not feel much for these kids, since they never seemed like real human beings, but rather like puppets controlled by Anderson above. The other Khaki Scouts, as well as Hayward's brothers, don't fare much better. The adult actors (also including, in minor roles, Tilda Swinton, Harvey Keitel, Jason Schwartzman and Bob Balaban) are much better. Don't get me wrong, I quite enjoyed this film. Anderson's directorial flourishes are well known by now, but are just as impressive as ever (if you like his stuff, obviously). The cinematography and production design are wonderful. And, as always, Anderson's choice of music, most notably these strange music education recordings composed by Benjamin Britten, is impeccable. I was just ever so slightly disappointed. I suspect if you like the two lead performances, you may find this one of Anderson's very best.",9,2,4,19 June 2012
The Sixth Sense," I think the surprise ending hurts the overall greatness of the film
","I saw this film months ago when it first came out, and I never stopped thinking about it. It is the only film of this year that deserved to make a lot of money (The Matrix and The Phantom Menace disappointed me terribly). It is unlike the rest of the movies Hollywood throws out. Unlike the empty Matrix and the Phantom Menace, the Sixth Sense is a character driven drama. It comes to a conclusion that no other ghost movie (that I've ever seen) has touched on. I think the film has a good chance to snatch up some Oscar noms. I think it deserves nods for script and definitely Best Supporting Actor in Osment (though he really is the main character, he is pushed to second string because of the bigger star). I wouldn't even be offended if Willis got a nom, seeing that this is his best film besides maybe 12 Monkeys and Pulp Fiction. Now for the ending that I mentioned in my summary. Most people will know about it this late in the game, but I won't tell. I think it pulls attention away from the true greatness of the film, which is the characters. It is what we were talking about after we left the theater, and I'm disappointed at myself for doing so. Sure it was neat, but I have gone through it in my mind several times, finding flaws within the film. Surprise endings are almost always detractors. If you remember a film just because of its surprise ending, it is a worthless film, just like The Usual Suspects, a very bad film if anyone would actually think about something besides the ending. overall 8/10, being a 9 originally, but losing 1 point for its supposed hook.",9,1,1,14 December 1999
Flight," Very good
","Quite good Oscar bait directed by Robert Zemeckis, who hasn't made a live action film since Cast Away in 2000. Denzel Washington stars as an alcoholic, drug addicted pilot. On a routine flight, some troubles occur and cause him to have to crash land the plane. Six people die in the crash, and it was only due to Washington's ingenious maneuver that anyone survived. The accident is clearly due to a mechanical error, but Washington's substance abuse problems come under scrutiny, and if they come out publicly, it will mean being charged with manslaughter, no matter the mechanical problems. This is mostly a standard story of alcoholism, but it's very well done, and Denzel is as good as he's been since his Oscar win back in 2001 (though I'd rank this performance far below his work in Training Day). Kelly Reilly is also excellent as a heroin addict whom he meets in the hospital. She wants to escape substance abuse herself, and Denzel's pigheadedness doesn't help. John Goodman, Bruce Greenwood and Don Cheadle, amongst others, also give great performances. The plane crash sequence is one of the best, most harrowing sequences of the year. I can't imagine any person seeing this in a theater and not gripping the hand rests tightly.",8,2,3,16 December 2012
Kagemusha," My God, Look at Those Colors!
","Akira Kurosawa is certainly one of the most important directors who ever lived. Most of his most famous films were made in the 50s and 60s. Rashomon, Ikiru, Yojimbo, and The Seven Samurai may be the four most famous films he made, and they were all in black and white. That format was wonderful. His films had a definitive look in that era. I would like to suggest, though, that he was the single best director of the color image who has existed thus far (whose work I am familiar with). I have only seen two of his color films (I don't even know how many he made), this film and Ran, but his sense of color in these two films is exquisite. I had to pause it several times during Kagemusha just to stare at the beautiful composition. I personally think that Kurosawa's talents rested mainly in the technical aspects of his films rather than the content (and I'm sure many people would argue against me here). So as for the film itself, I'd give it a 9/10 for two reasons. I was only emotionally involved during small sections of the film (the end was particularly powerful), and the story was somewhat difficult to follow (I was confused during Yojimbo and The Seven Samurai, too). I prefer Ran to this film (and to all the other films of his I've seen, which include Rashomon, The Seven Samurai, and Yojimbo). Still, Kagemusha is very good.",9,68,96,30 May 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A legitimately great movie
","An adventure movie to match the great ones of the past, and the one to beat for the future. The culmination of this ambitious trilogy is more than fitting; it surpasses the first two films by quite a distance. Almost nothing disappointed or bothered me. All parts of the story were equally interesting. It was sweeping, it was involving, it was beautiful. One of the few thing I would complain about is the villain. Sauron is boring and more or less unseen. He does not feel very threatening. And his army of orcs has been dull since the first film. They're just not very interesting creatures. Fortunately, The Return of the King really makes up for these monsters with a gallery of better ones. Some of them have been present in the other two films, trolls and those flying dragons that the ring wraiths ride on. They're more present here, however. Even better, though, those gigantic elephants, ten times the size of a normal one. Oh, man, those are cool. Star Wars fans might grumble that they were too much like the AT-AT walkers from Empire, and they are. One scene where Legolas, the elf, triumphs over one of them feels like a sped up version of Luke Skywalker's attack. But the very best thing is a giant spider. Everyone knows that there was originally a giant spider on skull island in King Kong, cut from the film because it really disturbed a test audience. Seeing the spider in Return of the King is like having that famous piece of lost footage restored. When all three films are finally out on their special edition DVDs, I'm going to spend a month combing through them to see whether or not the entire series of films isn't just as good as this one, or perhaps as good as many of my younger friends have sworn they were.",9,8,11,20 December 2003
Godzilla," The monster action is fun, but, overall, it's a disappointment
","Oh, the trailers looked so good. I had hope, and, for the most part, my only criterion was that it be better than Pacific Rim, Hollywood's attempt at the kaiju genre last year. I liked that one, but was disappointed (with Guillermo del Toro, I expected something with a little more meat). Godzilla does not clear that hurdle. It has the same major problem that all these kinds of films do: the human element is lacking. Severely here. And what a fantastic cast to waste! Bryan Cranston, Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins, David Strathairn, Elizabeth Olsen, Ken Watanabe! Every single one of them utterly wasted. Hopefully they all got a big check. We have all these people, but instead we're saddled with charisma black hole Aaron Taylor-Johnson (of Kick-Ass fame), who isn't even adequate. Thankfully, the big monster fights deliver, for the most part. There could maybe be more monster action, but when it's there, it's a lot of fun. I also thank the filmmakers for restraining themselves and keeping the film at only two hours (it runs a tad over that if you stay through the credits).",6,20,40,18 May 2014
Looper," Fun, but there wasn't enough thought put into its premise
","The third film from the director of Brick and The Brothers Bloom. This is Johnson's first big Hollywood film, and I had a hope he would make a revolutionary science-fiction picture that would blow every summer blockbuster out of the water. Alas, that's not how it's gone down, but Looper is certainly a fun sci-fi thriller. Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as a mob hit-man known as a Looper, whose job it is to whack victims sent back from 30 years in the future (why this has to be done is hastily and unsatisfactorily explained by JGL in voice-over). Every looper knows that one day he will have to kill the future version of himself, for which deed he will be compensated enough to live comfortably for the rest of his life. When it's JGL's turn, though, his future self, played by Bruce Willis, gets the better of him and escapes, and the mob is after them both. Time travel is one of the hardest science-fiction concepts to deal with, but there are just a handful of great time travel stories. I don't think this is one of them. For as smart as Johnson came off with Brick and The Brothers Bloom, the time travel premise seems like it should be far smarter. But whenever they try to explain the concept, the characters always say something like 'it's cloudy' or 'it's hazy.' Johnson's superior visual sense isn't much present here, either. It's a well directed film, for sure, but it's nothing amazing. With all of my complaints, I will say, even if I was disappointed, I was entertained. It's a fun picture. I just wish it weren't directed by Rian Johnson. Acting honors go to Emily Blunt and Jeff Daniels. Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis are both fine, though I did think that JGL was a little busy trying to impersonate Willis.",7,1,7,30 September 2012
Get Him to the Greek," A slight disappointment for a big fan of Forgetting Sarah Marshall
","A movie spin-off of Nicholas Stoller's previous film, Forgetting Sarah Marshall. That was one of my favorite comedies of the year in 2008. In fact, I include it fairly high on my top 10 list of that year in general. And Aldous Snow (played by British comedian Russell Brand) was part of the reason for that movie's success, for sure. So, alas, Snow's spin-off movie is unfortunately a mild disappointment. Jonah Hill (who had a small role in Sarah Marshall but plays a different character in this) works for a record company. He has an idea to re-ignite the fading rock star's career by having him perform a ten year anniversary gig at the site of one of his biggest triumphs. But, of course, Snow is a pampered rock star who likes to party constantly and do whatever the Hell he wants, and Hill is kind of a pushover. It's a simple story, and one that has been done before. All you have to do is string some good jokes along and it should work. It does work much of the time, in all honesty. It even has some good characters. I especially love Elisabeth Moss (Mad Men) as Hill's overworked girlfriend. And P. Diddy is actually really funny as Hill's boss. Colm Meaney (whom I always remember from Star Trek: The Next Generation) is also good as Snow's father. The film is sporadically funny - hilarious at times, even. But for some reason it always feels like it's kind of shallow and just not funny enough. Forgetting Sarah Marshall really scored by having just enough real emotion in the film that we ended up caring for the characters. I don't think this one ever gets that far, though it does try. Maybe Sarah Marshall's screenwriter (and star) Jason Segel should have collaborated on the script with Stoller. This film is still well worth a rental if you liked the first film. Kristen Bell has a nice cameo as Sarah Marshall in the film.",6,5,13,6 June 2010
Cloud Atlas," An enormous, ambitious film
","An outstanding achievement. I haven't read the novel (though I ordered it immediately after coming back from the film), but one can tell from the film that it was a behemoth as far as it came to the film adaptation. It's surprising that any director (or even any three directors) would see it and say, 'Yeah, I can do this.' Or that any studio would say, 'Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.' Judging by the box office, perhaps Warner Brothers made the wrong decision, but the directors have tackled their endeavor with vigor and produced a monstrous, beautiful, jaw-dropping film. The story covers six different time periods, from the mid-19th Century to who-knows how long after the end of human civilization as we know it. Each tale was at some point written down, and the characters in the next timeline are inspired and influenced by those stories. The novel is told in a sort of Russian nesting doll fashion, where the next story opens in the middle of the previous, and eventually get closed up at the end. The Wachowskis and Tykwer have taken Griffith's Intolerance as a model and have the stories flow in and out of each other. I can't say which one works better, but the film's version works wonderfully. I loved the ways they find links between the stories, themes or images. The best thing is all six of the stories are equally as wonderful, so I was never thinking 'When the Hell are we going to get back to the sci-fi story?' or whatever. I was involved with the film from alpha to omega, and never for a second felt like it was too long (or even too short). There's also the gimmick of having the main cast appear throughout each of the stories (which is unique to the film version), often playing different genders and races. Tom Hanks and Halle Berry are arguably the stars and probably have the most roles. South Korean actress Bae Doo-na is most memorable in her role as Sonmi-351, a fabricated human being in the 22nd Century. Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Jim Broadbent, Ben Whishaw, Keith David, Susan Sarandon and Hugh Grant, among others, also play multiple roles. The fact that this worked at all is amazing. That it works so well is a miracle. Definitely one of the best of the year.",10,37,71,4 November 2012
300," A movie made for teenage boys, so it'll do really well on IMDb
","But, hell, while it's far from perfect, I'll admit that it's a lot of fun. Put it into the guilty pleasure category if you will. It goes for the title of violentest movie ever, and I think it succeeds. Much of the movie consists of the Spartan warriors hacking away at Persian fodder, with limbs flying everywhere, with an occasional head thrown in for good measure (I was slightly disappointed that there were no entrails to be found). Sick as hell, yeah, but I think most of us have a little part of our brain left over from our uncivilized ancestry. Honestly, outside of the action sequences, the film is fairly worthless. The dialogue is overwrought and often embarrassing, with a heck of a lot of narration telling us about what it's like to be a Spartan. The exposition is lame (except for maybe the prologue  the part with the wolf was kind of cool). The trip to Thermopylae is dull, even when we find a tree with a hundred corpses impaled upon it. And, during the battle, whenever they show us what's happening in Sparta, I was always like, 'Who the *expletive deleted* gives a *expletive deleted*! Get back to the endless slaughter!' The movie would have worked a hundred times better if it had just been 90 minutes of straight battle, with the only pauses being the tense, dark nights between them. So, really, the movie isn't all that great. But, hell, I have to give it my recommendation. Any movie that features a decapitated head spiraling through the air in slow motion has to be worth the price of admission.",7,6,17,12 March 2007
Easy A," Unbelievable and not very funny, but Emma Stone is so terrific it almost works
","This was hailed by some as being a cut above the average high school comedy. Its star, Emma Stone, starred in what is perhaps my favorite high school movie, Superbad. This one may be better than the average high school comedy, but it's not especially great, either. I obviously wasn't a girl in high school, and it's been over a decade since I've been there, but the events in this movie just don't come close to my actual high school experience. If you don't know the story, it's about a girl, Stone, who invents a sexual partner, and immediately becomes known as a slut around the school. Then she starts to pretend to be stupping a bunch of losers so they become more popular. When I went to school, any girl who looked like Emma Stone or the other gals in this movie, you'd kind of assume they were having sex (Hell, any girl who dressed like these girls, even before Stone embraces her inner slut, would probably be sent home to change, and my high school was pretty dang liberal). It might make guys like me upset because we could never have them, and it might make the ugly girls jealous, but would it ever have been as big a deal as it is in this movie? Not much of it seemed believable to me. It's worst offense, though, is that it just isn't all that funny. There are a few good laughs, but otherwise, it's kind of dull. Yet I didn't come close to hating it. Emma Stone, for one thing, is exceptional. Even when the writing is poor, she sells it. She's just got some wonderful comic timing, and her eyes are wonderfully expressive. I also absolutely love Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci as her goofy parents. I really wish they had gotten more time. Instead, they spend a lot of time on a really bizarre and underdeveloped subplot involving her teacher (Thomas Hayden Church), who is married to the school guidance counselor (Lisa Kudrow).",6,2,2,26 December 2010
The Thin Red Line," Better than I originally thought, but I still don't see it as a masterpiece
","This was the first Malick film I ever saw, back in the theater in early 1999. I didn't think much of it, but I liked it enough to check out his other two films, and liked them both a lot. And his subsequent two films have been fantastic. So I assumed I was probably wrong about this one. Well, I did like it more the second time around. Unfortunately, I still don't think it's a great film, and I probably agree with my assessment that this is his least good work. It is a very beautiful film, but, really, what exactly is it saying that is that much different from what any other WWII movie was saying, including its chief rival, Saving Private Ryan (which I also reassessed as a little better than I had originally thought about seven or eight months ago)? It's pretty much comprised of scenes of soldiers ducking in the grass, quivering, throwing a grenade, getting picked off, yada yada yada. In the end, I don't find it especially profound, as gripping as it no doubt is at times (almost the entire first hour of the film depicts the taking of one hill, and it's every bit as nerve-wracking as the D-Day sequence of Saving Private Ryan). Acting honors belong to Nick Nolte, Elias Koteas, Woody Harrelson and Sean Penn. Acting dishonors belong solely to Jim Caviezel, whom I still hate. What a damn bore that guy is, and his subsequent role as Jesus makes several of his scenes unintentionally humorous. The appearances of John Cusack, John Travolta and George Clooney are distracting, even if none of them are particularly bad in their roles. So, the big question: SPR or TRL? I'd actually go with SPR. Sure, the bookend sequences are absolutely awful and insulting, but Spielberg does construct a handful of sequences which are the very definition of taut, gripping cinema (obviously the D-Day sequence, but also the sniper sequence where Vin Diesel bites it and Jeremy Davies' big sequence at the end, among a few others). As for the Academy Awards, I think, despite the fact that they were bought off, Shakespeare in Love deserved the big award. Although, who knows, perhaps that would suck on re-watch (haven't seen it for over a decade, either, though I've seen it at least once since I saw it in the theater). Perhaps I should give it another go.",8,2,6,26 June 2011
Honey," Mediocre dance movie
","Hip-hop dancer Jessica Alba wants to become a professional, as well as save her dance studio, the only place where local kids can hang out and not get in trouble. Yes, it's a 2000s version of Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo. Unfortunately, Honey has little of the charm of the Breakin' movies. Well, maybe in 20 years it'll be seen as camp, too. It's kind of the only way any Jessica Alba movies, save maybe Sin City, will ever be viewed in the future. The film is less than terrible when it focuses on the dancing. I say yes to Jessica Alba dancing. Apparently she knew nothing about dancing before taking the role. It's impressive that she learned how to do it so well. Has no one suggested maybe acting classes?",5,0,3,11 January 2009
Fantastic Four," Bad, but not as bad as I expected
","Fantastic Four probably should have been more insulting, because, in reality, it's completely idiotic. It's the kind of movie where all the extras behave like movie extras and not just real-life bystanders. No one seems to think too much of it when a guy bursts into flames or a chick becomes invisible. Maybe a couple of gasps with one hand covering the mouth. I think the film mostly survives because the actual actors of the film aren't half bad. Both Michael Chiklis as the Thing and Chris Evans as the Human Torch are compelling whenever they're the focus. Jessica Alba is compelling, too, if only for her gorgeousness. Ioan Gruffudd is the only dud among the heroes. He always seems to add nothing to a picture. I also liked Julian McMahon as the villain. The stupidity of the whole thing isn't the film's biggest problem. The thing is, there's not much conflict in the picture. The Four (or most of them anyway) want to cure themselves, and too much of the movie is spent on this part of the plot. The villain doesn't do too much until near the end. The Four don't even realize he's a villain until the final fifteen minutes.",5,1,3,7 September 2009
Pineapple Express," Very funny
","A stoner comedy/action movie send-up from the Apatow factory. Seth Rogen witnesses a murder and gets his drug dealer, James Franco, mixed up in the mess. The two go on the run as some gangsters search for them. It's very loose and sloppy, with an improvised feeling. There are long stretches where I didn't laugh much, and there are some plot developments that make little sense. Fortunately, much of the film is inspired silliness, and Rogen's and Franco's comic timing is great. I was frequently in tears. Danny McBride and Craig Robinson both give break-out supporting performances. The final sequence in the diner pushes this one for me from pretty good to almost great. I'm not quite sure why David Gordon Green was hired to direct this. Many of the critics who wrote about Pineapple Express went out of their way identifying the elements that belong to him. I'm not a big fan of his art films, but he's a decent director, and anyone could have shot this one, entertaining though it may be.",8,1,5,10 August 2008
Sin City," Robert Rodriguez is an undervalued talent
","I rarely hear anyone mention Robert Rodriguez as one of the best directors today, but he really is. He's the definition of an auteur. He does his own thing, and the movies he makes are completely his. Who cares that they're pap? There is such a thing as great pap, and Rodriguez, though he might not get the kudoz he deserves today, is the king of it. And, judging by his insistence at Frank Miller's directorial credit on the film, which led to Rodriguez's resignation from the DGA, he's a great collaborator and a grand example of modesty, as well. Sin City is an exceptionally entertaining film. It's not deep, but it's engrossing. The script is made up of three (and a half) short stories, starring some of the most wicked anti-heroes of filmdom. Mickey Rourke's segment will probably be best remembered. He plays a giant thug trying to avenge a prostitute who gave him the night of his life. Clive Owen plays a murderer just out of plastic surgery who wants to protect an abused girl (Brittany Murphy) from her ex-boyfriend (Benicio del Toro). Things get out of hand when the two men wander into a section of town run by lethal hookers. The final main segment, which actually wraps around the other two, involves Bruce Willis as a cop who saves a young girl from violence, only to be framed for that very violence. Rodriguez doesn't shy away from either the film noir or comic book origins. Instead, the two sources explode. The Raymond Chandler-esque dialogue is a hoot. This will be one film to be remembered when making our Best of 2005 lists.",9,2,7,3 April 2005
The Nice Guys," A tad disappointing given the fantastic trailers (which spoiled the film a little), but still a lot of fun
","'70s detective movie starring Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe, directed by Kiss Kiss Bang Bang's Shane Black. It is a ton of fun. There's definitely something missing that I'm not quite able to put my finger on - it really feels like it should be an all-time classic, but ends up falling short. There's some weaknesses in the script, like Black isn't quite able to make his themes work entirely. It has so much great stuff in it, though. The two leads are ace, both giving near-career best performances. Angourie Rice is also excellent as Gosling's teenage daughter. They do fail to establish a great antagonist, though bad guys Matt Bomer, Keith David and Beau Knapp are all memorable. Others who will remain nameless aren't as good. The film is very funny, thankfully, with Crowe and Gosling bouncing off each other nicely. It is true most of the best bits were given away in the film's two trailers. If you haven't seen them, you might enjoy this even more than I did. I'd definitely recommend it either way.",8,70,116,28 May 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Friggin' amazing!
","Tremendous. It's a nonstop thrill-ride with interesting, though quickly drawn, characters and some of the most economical storytelling I've ever seen. It makes all other Hollywood action movies look like they're in kindergarten. Every minute brings a new indelible image. It has a strong female presence, with Charlize Theron as almost a co-lead to Tom Hardy's Max. Both Theron and Hardy are wonderful, with Hardy giving Max a very different flavor from Mel Gibson. I loved Nicholas Hoult, as well, and Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played the Toecutter in the original Mad Max, has a powerful presence as the major villain. A masterpiece of its genre. I loved it so much I saw it twice this week in the theater.",10,12,33,17 May 2015
Pocahontas," Pretty and with good music, but not very good overall
","After the huge success of The Lion King and the three films preceding it, Pocahontas effectively ended Disney's Renaissance in 1995. They've never been able to recover from it, relying instead on Pixar to carry the mantle (although I would argue that Disney has had a handful of films in the past ten years that rival, and are probably far better than their run from The Little Mermaid to The Lion King). Pocahontas has a few things going for it. Honestly, it's one of Disney's best looking films. The colors in particular are gorgeous. And the music is good, too. Not great, but I like it far better than the music of the The Lion King or Beauty and the Beast, both of which have horribly overrated music. The music of Pocahontas did, in fact, win two Oscars, for both score and Best Song ('The Colors of the Wind'). While I can sit through a film with such merits, the bad stuff really weighs it down. Disney really shouldn't have tackled a historical story, no matter how mythologized. And they REALLY shouldn't have added cutesy animal sidekicks. That's the biggest crime of the film by far, the raccoon and hummingbird that follow Pocahontas around, getting into trouble, and the bad guy's pug, all far too anthropomorphized. If Disney had attempted to make a more mature movie, it might have worked, but then maybe they couldn't have padded out the runtime with the animal antics. The film also suffers from a good amount of mid-90s political correctness. The conflict boils down to 'Argh! We're the evil white people and all we want to do is kill savages!' and 'Ugh. We're noble savages who like corn, or, as we call it, maize. We love animals and nature and crap. Look, there's a talking, magical tree over there. And check out my daughter's pet raccoon! Isn't it funny?' It's all terribly insulting. Still better than the boring The Lion King.",6,0,1,23 July 2012
The Social Network," Extremely entertaining
","This one had a lot of things going against it, at least for me. First, I generally don't like David Fincher, with the one exception of Zodiac. Second, I also don't like Aaron Sorkin. I'm not extremely familiar with his work, but I used to watch his show Sports Night and it's pretty freaking difficult to forgive him for that pile of crap. Third, I could not care less about Facebook. It just seems incredibly unnecessary, I don't like people I barely know or haven't known in a long while having any knowledge of my current comings and goings, and, heck, IMDb takes up so much time of my life why would I really want another bit of the internet biting off chunks of my life? Of course, this movie is solely about the founding of Facebook and really does little or nothing with the way Facebook has affected the concept of friendship in the 21st Century (although, honestly, that sounds like an interesting film itself, but I probably wouldn't watch it because it would make me feel so out of the loop!). And it is a fairly interesting story. As for Fincher, that one exception of Zodiac is the reason I will probably see anything he makes in the future (some may wait for video, however). Plus, this one seemed like it would be tapping into Fincher's Zodiac talent, what with its being a complex true story. His talent is in his attention to details, and it serves him well here. Sorkin is a little harder to get over, and during the opening sequence, in which Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) has a quick-witted conversation/argument with his date (Rooney Mara), I was very afraid that I was going to be beat down by his overly clever dialogue. Fortunately, that scene is the worst in the movie, and, while occasionally the dialogue feels overwrought, generally it's smart without showing off. So, with all of the challenges conquered, how did it fare for me? Very well, in fact. It's far from the greatest film ever made, which is what the insane buzz was saying beforehand, but it's very entertaining. Really, the story shouldn't be anywhere near as entertaining as the film turns out to be. When I went over it again in my head, it felt fairly shallow. But it rushes along with such energy that it swept me along with it like an ocean wave. Fincher does a great job, and he's helped exponentially by the editing (Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall) and the score (Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross). I really want the score to win the Oscar, if for no other reason than to give Trent Reznor an Oscar. My 17 year old self would be ecstatic at that proposition. The cast is also excellent. I think they work best as an ensemble, but, yes, Eisenberg is wonderful, Andrew Garfield shows off his star potential in his biggest role yet and Justin Timberlake is amazing as the guy who created Napster. It may not be a masterpiece, but it's definitely one of the best films of 2010.",8,4,10,3 October 2010
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," As good as the first two
","The Last Crusade is the Indiana Jones film I've seen least. In fact, I may be lying if I were to say I've seen it more than once all the way through before this viewing. Having watched all three of the original trilogy last week, I have to say, there isn't a great gap between them in quality. They're all three excellent movies with brilliant direction by Spielberg, and pitch-perfect action sequences, paced just so as not to overwhelm the viewer. The Last Crusade is the most comic of the three films, adding Sean Connery as Indy's father and pairing the two as a kind of Abbot and Costello team. It's shocking just how well it works  if I hadn't seen the movie and you told me Harrison Ford and Sean Connery would be the perfect comic duo, I'd have been more than a little dubious. Connery isn't known for his comic chops, but, if he didn't have them before, he definitely earned them here. I think, after James Bond (and I'd say unfortunately so), his Henry Jones Sr. will prove to be his most remembered performance. Denholm Elliot and John Rhys-Davies both return from Raiders, and both are more comic characters this time around (Elliot in particular is hilarious; I think Sallah is kind of wasted in this one). Alison Doody plays Indy's double-crossing love interest. I had remembered her as being particularly forgettable, but this time around I thought she was quite good. I still have to wonder what happened to Karen Allen (which is kind of explained in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull), who was by far the best of the Indy girls, but Doody is good at what she does. River Phoenix appears in the brilliant opening sequence as young Indiana Jones. What a sad waste his death was.",9,0,1,25 May 2008
The Birds," Fascinating; Freudian analysis of The Birds
","One would think, not having seen this film, that it is just a normal horror film where a mass of animals attacks people who run from them and scream. Well, this film is different, in that it was directed by the single greatest director of all times, Alfred Hitchcock. The Birds was made during his peak. It follows on the heels of such films as Rear Window, Vertigo, North by Northwest and Psycho. It is as well directed as those films. In fact, it is even more daring than those. Several classical Hollywood elements are missing from this film. For one thing, and perhaps the most effective choice made by Hitchcock for this film, there is no musical score. Even in his best films, Psycho and Vertigo, for instance, the films are swept along by the score. They are great scores, by maybe the best score composer who ever worked in the movies, Bernard Herrmann, but to see a Hitchcock film without a score is just fantastic. Even the best musical scores are meant to manipulate your emotions, so here we get a chance to see just how effective a film can be without one. Also, the end of this film is perhaps the most unconventional you're ever going to see (although Vertigo also has a very unconventional ending). It is possibly the most startling image I've ever seen. Even if it just had Hitchcock's amazing direction going for it, The Birds also benefits from an absolutely masterful script. It is never as if the story is just that birds attack people. It is much, much more complex than that. And herein lies my Freudian Analysis. Of course, coming right after Psycho, Hitch was probably jumping to keep the whole Oedipus theme alive here. Annie, the school teacher, expresses this literally. But I would like to interpret the birds as more of a symbol than actual matter. Think back to the film Forbidden Planet. Remember the Monster of the Id, the invisible and immaterial beast who destroyed every person who attempted to take Dr. Morbius and his daughter off the planet, basically whoever threatened to steal his daughter from him? I think the birds in The Birds serve the same function for Lydia. When Melanie Daniels, a supposed sexual predator, enters the small, peaceful town of Bodega Bay, she does so to prey on Mitch Brenner. We find out, just as much by her actions as by Annie's speech, that Lydia is very jealous of her son's women. Melanie is also introducing her carnality onto the town as a whole. She brings the love birds for Cathy. Mitch had at first asked that the love birds not be too willing to display their love, and the first thing that Cathy asks is, 'How can I tell which one is male and which one is female?' Notice also that the mother in the restaurant attacks her for being responsible. This ought to seem ridiculous, but it seems perfectly logical in the text of this film. The woman says, 'I think you're responsible. Who are you? WHAT are you?' At the end of the film, Lydia does seem to accept Melanie. The birds are still there, but they do not harm them as they leave. Too often this film gets shoved into the horror genre and left there. I believe it was Hitchcock's most successful film, and for some reason, I think that more people could identify it and identify it as a Hitchcock film than any of his other films except for maybe Psycho. The Birds, and Psycho, too, which is also often classified as a horror film (which it is not in any way) are far too complex to be labeled with such a small label. They are both masterpieces. Psycho has always been regarded as one. The Birds is sometimes, but not as often. It is certainly one of Hitchcock's best. This man was a god. The Birds is a godly film. 10/10",10,6,12,21 November 2000
Princess Mononoke," one of the best films i've ever had the chance to see
","Princess Mononoke is, without a doubt, one of the best films I have ever witnessed. There has never been an animated film even close to this -- I kept thinking after I left the theater, how can Disney even have the guts to make another film after seeing this? Even live action movies pale in comparison to Princess Mononoke. There has never been a film to pay such close attention to details. Watch for the magnificent and subtle flying insects throughout the film, especially in the ancient forest, where bioluminescent dragonflies glide gently around the screen. There are thousands of subtleties such as this. You'd have to see it a dozen times to appreciate this film fully. Aside from it being the most beautiful film I've ever seen, it also has an enormously powerful script. The characters are some of the the most well rounded in all film. Ashitaka especially, the main character of the film, is so nuanced that he has become in my mind one of the great characters in film, up there with Charles Foster Kane and Jake LaMotta. I would compare him to Freder, the main character of Fritz Lang's Metropolis. His role in the film is a mediator between the forces of humans and the gods of nature. Both sides comment several times that Ashitaka must be on the other side, when he is trying desperately to convince everyone that there are no sides. Peace is the way. There is a little to be desired in the American voice talent. Claire Daines was certainly a wrong choice for San (Princess Mononoke), and Billy Bob Thornton just could not hide his southern accent, which made the character of Jigo seem more comical than he was probably supposed to be. Gillian Anderson's voice clashed with her character, the wolf god Moro, a bit. It hardly affected my passion. The film was so spectacular and beautiful that James Earl Jones could have voiced San and it would have detracted little. Definitely, though, I'm praying that they release the DVD with subtitle options. Anyway, Princess Mononoke is the best film of 1999, the best film of the 1990's, and, in my personal top ten list, no lower than #5, but closer to #2. 12 hours later and my heart is still beating with the power of Princess Mononoke! America: SEE IT!",10,291,341,7 November 1999
Jurassic Park," A bit disappointing considering its credentials
","Upon seeing JPIII today, I was thinking back to the first and the second. JPIII earned a 7/10 from me, which means that it accomplished what it set out to do with minimal stupidity and no pretenses.The first one I also gave a 7/10. Originally, I had given it a 9/10, but I hadn't seen it since it was first in the theaters in 1992 and was just remembering how cool it was that first time you saw a computer animated dinosaur, how the word 'wow' was on everybody's lips for months and even years afterwards when recalling this film. Unfortunately, when I saw it again in 1999, and after I had actually studied film and had a superior understanding of the art form, it seemed trite. Comparing it to the other toothy monster which Spielberg brought to life, Jaws, Jurassic Park is a near dud. One who once made action masterpieces later made pap, hardly better than any other action film at the theaters. JPI is better than JP3. It creates suspense a bit better. I can't think of a more tense moment than when the little girl falls through the floor and a raptor's mouth comes about an inch from her dangling foot. Still, it is nothing more than an actioner. A good one, but not anything better.",8,2,4,28 July 2001
The Simpsons Movie," Meant more for casual fans than for diehards. Plus, the format just doesn't really work as a movie, I think.
","I'm an absolute fanatic of The Simpsons and have been watching it since it was on Tracey Ullman. I grew up with it. I was the exact same age as Bart when the very first episode premiered. Unlike a lot of fans, I've never turned my back on the show. I am not one who thinks each new episode is worse than the last. I do acknowledge that it's long past its peak, but I think almost every new episode is funny enough to be worth seeing. Once in a while, they'll produce an episode that's genuinely fantastic. But, really, I don't demand fantastic. I'll settle for a few good laughs and be at least moderately happy. Now comes The Simpsons Movie, which had been talked about for the last 15 years, at least. Much like when I watch new episodes, I wasn't expecting the movie to be that great. Unfortunately, it fell below even those expectations. It has a few good jokes and moments (the only time I laughed really loud was the Tom Hanks bit), but it doesn't do much right. Those who've long turned their backs on the show like to complain about recycled plot lines. It's true, of course, for pretty much every new episode, but the show has grown more manic and self-referential over time. Many don't like that, either, but I personally do like those kind of jokes. The movie just plods along with a predictable plot that's made up of some of the most basic of all Simpsons plots: Homer and Marge relationship problems, Lisa's environmental concerns, and Bart's loss of faith in his father. None of it here is done with the irony of the newer episodes. It's like it's part of the really early Simpsons, when we hadn't seen these plots a billion times. Except it completely lacks the perfect comic timing of the early seasons. In the end, the movie is only an occasionally amusing affair. Certainly it's worth seeing if you're a fan, but, unless you're the kind of nut I am, you can wait for the DVD.",6,35,64,29 July 2007
The Soloist," Wright, Downey and Foxx are good enough artists to lift this above its Oscar bait plot
","This film was supposed to be a major competitor for the Oscars last year, but Paramount bumped it to a few months later. Despite the mixed reviews the film has received, I believe it would have been a major contender. I honestly think Paramount's decision not only ruined its chances for Oscars, it gave the impression that there was something wrong with the picture. There isn't, really. The subject matter does scream 'Oscar Bait', with Robert Downey Jr. playing a newspaper columnist who writes about a schizophrenic genius musician (Jamie Foxx) who is homeless on the streets of L.A. We all remember Shine. Shine was pretty good (if entirely made up, as we later discovered). The Soloist is probably a little better. I think it's stronger because of its exploration of the relationship between the two central characters. Both Downey and Foxx are extremely good; both are award-worthy. This material could easily have been cheesy Oscar bait, but director Joe Wright (Pride and Prejudice and Atonement) is a virtuoso himself. The way he uses image and sound move the story along beautifully, not allowing the clichés to clog up the film.",8,53,76,26 April 2009
Up in the Air," I don't think it's particularly memorable, but it's quite enjoyable while it plays
","George Clooney stars as a man who spends most of his life up in the air, flying throughout America. His profession: a man who fires people. Companies hire his company to send experts in to ease laid-off employees through their transition period. It's pretty loosely plotted, but the biggest events are his hooking up with fellow frequent flyer Vera Farmiga, with whom he builds a nice, no-strings-attached relationship that becomes about the only set thing in his life, and his training of young Anna Kendrick, a hotshot Cornell grad who hopes to revolutionize the industry by introducing teleconference firing. Clooney, of course, objects, partly because he thinks he should be there when he's terminating employees (the personal touch is needed), and partly because he hasn't reached the fabled 10 million mile mark. And he doesn't want to be home in Omaha. The film is basically an examination of a fleeting and lonely lifestyle. It actually manages to make it look kind of romantic, even with the loneliness (Hell, one can be just as lonely when they're stuck in one place). I think some of the later parts of the film, especially the whole sequence where Clooney attends his sister's wedding, a tad weaker than the flying bits. I don't think the film really has much of a coherent theme - the lay-off parts seem to me just a gimmick to set the film in the present, to give it a contemporary feel. The airport lifestyle remains the bulk of the film that is most memorable, and it's quite wonderful and sad in its way. It's also quite funny and charming. I don't think it's an especially memorable film, but it's a pretty darn good one.",8,3,9,20 December 2009
V for Vendetta," A film that should be easily dismissable
","It has a very mixed message and one of the sloppiest screenplays I've encountered in quite some time (Andy and Larry Wachowski, the directors and screenwriters of the Matrix Trilogy, are responsible for it). The lead character wears a mask the entire time, so the character has almost no ability to engage the audience himself. Plus, nearer the end, he is turned from a person into a purely figurative symbol. Natalie Portman has to carry the entire movie, and, while she's very beautiful, even when shaved bald, she's not a strong enough performer to accomplish the task (plus, her British accent is less than believable). There are also a ton of silly and unbelievable moments. However, with all that against it, V for Vendetta has some intriguing ideas and is a fairly rousing picture in the end. The story posits a fascist government in Britain in the near future (or in an alternative present). Most of the film's value exists in the believability of this government and how it operates. The film pays close attention to how the government and the media control the people. The references to modern day America are clear, and it's not hard to buy that a similar course of events could take place. There's even scenes where the government is listening into citizens, which is a current event that couldn't have been news when this script was being written. A fair amount of our population, directly after September 11th, said that they would give up their privacies and freedoms in exchange for safety. The hero of the film, V, is a terrorist, any way you look at it, and that is problematic for sure. The movie does not necessarily side with his cause completely, but it certainly doesn't reject his ideas either. The movie uses the story of Guy Fawkes; V wants to carry out what Fawkes failed at. If you know the story, you might guess the ending. But as my friend wondered, how would the movie be accepted if the film had ended with the Capitol building in Washington D.C. being destroyed? A difficult movie to deal with, but definitely worth sitting through.",7,2,13,20 March 2006
The Island," Wow! It turns out Michael Bay can actually make a good movie. Even a great one!
","Maybe I was just feeling easy, but Bay's The Island strikes me as the most satisfying film I've seen all summer  very possibly the best film I've seen so far from 2005. Is it brilliant? Perhaps not, but it's a gripping sci-fi thriller that works on almost all levels. As sci-fi, it reminds me of stuff from the 70s like Logan's Run. I'm a big fan of Utopian/Dystopian sci-fi, and it pleased me enormously on that level. As an action film, it has a lot of stunning set pieces and chases. The action sequences are a lot clearer than is usual for Bay. Unlike two other actioners I've recently seen, Mr. & Mrs. Smith and The Devil's Rejects, I was never at all confused at what was happening. There aren't too many action bits that made me think, 'Yeah right,' and at least one of those over-the-top moments had a punchline that was so funny that it was very well worth it (it was probably the only one liner from an action movie that ever made me laugh out loud). The actors are all just models here (Scarlet Johanssen is some very good eye candy), but I did like a few of the supporting character actors, notably Ethan Phillips, Brian Stepanek, and the always reliable Steve Buscemi. Michael Clark Duncan is also good, though his part is too small. Sure, the film's political agenda skews to the right, but the story follows a common science fiction motif which questions a scientific moral issue to a ridiculous extreme. Frankenstein is pretty conservative, as well. I think that the politics in The Island are historically interesting, but not something that could effect anyone's opinion. The production design is outstanding, as are the cinematography and score. I couldn't have believed that Michael Bay could actually produce something not only watchable, but damn good. I think if it hadn't been him who directed it, the movie would be getting a lot more praise.",9,2,10,8 August 2005
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," By Far the Worst Movie the Coen Brothers Have Ever Done
","Like many people, I first became associated with the Coen brothers through Fargo. They might have been the first filmmakers whose entire body of work I searched out and watched. And I liked every one of them. And then I was the first person in line to see their next film (their previous film now) The Big Lebowski. And that one just added to their shining reputation.
And now, some three and a half or so years later, comes their next film, O Brother, Where Art Thou? It has all the marks of a Coen brothers' movie, but, for some reason, it doesn't work at all. And I know why, or at least I think I do. What makes a Coen brothers' film distinct from a film of another director? Some would say quirkiness. This is certainly part of it. But people can copy quirkiness, and have. Take Being John Malkovich. It is possibly the quirkiest film ever made outside of the Coen universe. But no one would mistake it for a Coen brothers' film. Why is this? Well, in my opinion, which, of course, is informed, it is the Coen brothers' sense of perfection and meticulousness both in the technical aspects, the performances, and the script. Technically, O Brother is a match for any of their other films. The cinematography, mise-en-scene, sound and editing are great. The script is the biggest problem. It is bad. Not that there aren't good ideas in there. In fact, any one of the episodes could have turned out to be hilarious. Possibly, its just that there are too many episodes. Therefore, each episode runs for approximately two minutes before it is over. Each episode comprises about one sequence, and each sequence is composed of about two or three scenes. Take a look at Miller's Crossing, for example, to compare. The pace is slow. O Brother is not a short movie, yet it feels that way. And because of the sloppy script, there are no performances to speak of, really. I like any one of the actors on screen, but their characters, even the character of George Clooney, are all one dimensional. It isn't necessary to flesh out every character of a comedy, but I think some of the more colorful supporting characters should have had more screentime, more development. John Goodman should have had a more substantial part, for instance (although his Southern accent is not very good), and Charles Durning's part should have been better. In fact, the whole gubernatorial race part of the plot should have been more in focus. I would have based the plot more around it, rather than having it taking place in the corners. The way the Coens get rid of Durning's opponent is just bad.
The only thing the film did get right is the music. The main song that the escapees sing is just marvelous. And all the other songs written by T. Bone Burnett are excellent, also. In fact, it would be a travesty if at least that main song didn't get nominated for an Oscar. It completely deserves it. I would have given the film an all-time Coen brothers low score of 4/10, 7/10 being the former low (The Hudsucker Proxy), but I have to give it at least one point for the music, so final score = 5/10.",7,3,5,19 January 2001
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Good, but a big drop off after the hilarity of Anchorman
","Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, in my mind, is one of the funniest (perhaps the funniest) films of the current decade. This similar-sounding film comes from the same team of writer/director Adam McKay and writer/star Will Ferrel. It's not at the same level as Anchorman, unfortunately. It has its share of huge laughs  far more than enough to make the film worth seeing. It's just not as consistently funny. The audience frequently laughed loudly, but there was a fair share of jokes that were dead in the water. Crickets could be heard occasionally. Unlike Anchorman, there are only a couple of lines worth quoting, and I kind of doubt that people will ever be referencing it. McKay and Ferrell also try to insert a heart into the picture. Generally, I think this is a mistake. While heartfelt comedies do work, sometimes (like in Anchorman) it's just nice to have something that makes you laugh your butt off. I think, for example, the Farrelly brothers have really lost their way, and I think last year's The 40 Year Old Virgin, of which Talladega Nights is 2006's equivalent, sacrificed many laughs in order to be sweet. Surprisingly, it works quite well in Talladega Nights. It is actually a bit painful to watch Ricky Bobby and his best friend (played by John C. Reilly) split up. The material with Ricky's neglectful father (played by Gary Cole, most famous for his role as the wishy-washy boss Lumberg in Office Space) is actually quite potent. The audience was audibly upset near the end of the film when it looked like this character was going to have a change of heart, but doesn't. It's quite impressive, honestly, that McKay and Ferrell didn't compromise just to please the audience and have a happier solution with that character. Just one of the many reasons why I can't help but have some affection for this movie.",7,1,4,7 August 2006
Semi-Pro," Not Ferrell's best work, but still pretty funny
","Another Will Ferrell sports movie. Sigh, right? Personally, I think the guy's funny. And I think his vehicles are funnier than most comedies being made right now. The previous one, Blades of Glory, I thought was completely undervalued. Semi-Pro, unfortunately, is a step down. It's not bad, to be sure. I laughed plenty, and I'd give it a moderate recommendation. Ferrell fans should definitely take it in. They won't be sorry they did. But there just aren't enough great jokes to make it a must-see comedy. And you know that when there aren't a ton of great jokes 90% of the good ones you've already seen in the commercials. There's a lot of half-baked material, too. I think, for instance, that Will Arnet's character was particularly hilarious, but they just don't give him enough to do. Ditto Matt Walsh, who plays a pastor moonlighting as a referee. Good jokes to be made there, but they are given a pass.",7,6,15,2 March 2008
