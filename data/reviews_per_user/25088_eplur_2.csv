Lucky Number Slevin," defines witty, smart, cute
","One of the best movies I have seen in years. When I say this movie deserves 10 out of 10, it means; I want to watch it again. While watching this movie -- I felt that way. Cimatrography -- excellent; Cast -- Believe me -- beyond excellent. If you think Lucy Lui has carried some movies -- watch this... this defines her. This is the movie that should be taught in film school. Alright... I don't have any thing else to say..... but heehaw dude..people... this is automated.... I 've got to put some letters here.. and it will accept me.. OKAY... you know what... it's asking for enough lines... but hey you wactch the fkin movie and you will fill the lines for this movie......aight let me try. FINALLY...TRY TO SUBMIT YOUR COMMENT AND YOU WILL UNDERSTAND.",10,0,4,22 June 2006
Wanted," A very good popcorn flick
","If you go to a movie for entertainment  this is a movie for you. If you go to a movie for the artistic value of it, then stay away from it. I personally take the movie for what it is, and I greatly enjoyed it. It's fun, action packed and a hot chick is in there . If I have to sum up this movie, make comparisons -- I would say at the face value, it's a mixture of The Matrix (the corridor scene), Equilibrium (the gun fights and the logic behind their superiority), and the Enter the Dragon (fighting climaxes, moving up killing the villains to get to the main boss). If you liked those movies above you should enjoy this one as well.I think James McAvoy did very well in this movie. I liked him in The Last King of Scotland but he could not really shine in front of the mighty Forest Whitaker. This movie is all about him, there is hardly a scene without him once he comes in.All in all Wanted is a fun movie to watch for its action, graphics, and stunts.",9,2,6,11 July 2008
