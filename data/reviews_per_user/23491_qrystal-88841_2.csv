War Dogs," Better to go for Second part.
",This movie is too good. It has very fantastic story...the actors are even more than the best. And I expect to get its sequel. The ending hasn't focused much on the big fat guy :D. I was startled by the cast and the story that moves on so smoothly. The scene of Iraq was even more amazing showing how the driver gets the free petrol. The disastrous condition of the country was portrayed nicely. However I didn't understand why the Chinese ammo was considered so crap by the US. :PWell made movie and the only thing I hated was the acting of 'Iz' and less appearance of Bradley Cooper. I didn't know Miles Teller is good in acting. I watched this movie all because of Jonah Hill as Efraim. He is brilliant actor.,10,0,1,26 December 2016
Aquaman," best DC movie free from feminism
",Finally DCEU has given a worthy superhero movie and the character Aquaman played by Jason Momoa is perfectly justifiable.,10,2,5,26 January 2019
