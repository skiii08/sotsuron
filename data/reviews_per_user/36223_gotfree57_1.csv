Black Swan," Rather shallow movie. I am giving 6 for it.
","Rather quite shallow approach to the problem, which may arise after pushing child by parent(s) to achieve some 'unbelievably' high results.Hallucinations may appear after extreme mental/physical exhaustion while trying to reach unreachable. The movie is a quite well description of psychiatric problem. One may think even about schizophrenic hallucinations of the swan'. But this seems to be not the case since there is no spitting of personality (duplication) of the ballerina' mind.I would give 6 for the movie. This is a quite typical movie for the USA audience.",6,1,2,10 March 2011
