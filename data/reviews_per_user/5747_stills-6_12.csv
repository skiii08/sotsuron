Love and Death," Heady stuff for a wacky comedy
","This 'Early' Woody Allen movie may be the best all-out comedy he's ever done. I remember the comparisons made between Mel Brooks and Allen before 'Annie Hall', but Brooks can't hold a candle to what Allen can do. This movie is layered with truth the way earlier European expressionist movies are (and which he would explore more fully in later movies), except this is a lot funnier. Not at all like other 70s Allen films like 'Everything you ever wanted to know about sex' or even 'Bananas'. This is very sardonic, heady stuff for a wacky comedy.One of my favorite scenes of all time is about how Napoleon is trying to compete with Wellington by making a better pastry.",7,2,2,18 October 1999
Minority Report," Empty action movie masquerading as high-concept
","You can forgive the odd plot holes here and there when the story is set in the future. You can forgive the misguided and poorly thought-out acting jobs when the settings are supposed to be more interesting than the characters. You can forgive the silly action sequences that are nonetheless visually impressive. And you can forgive the script for supplying weak exposition through dialogue because the writer thinks the story will be too difficult to follow.You could forgive all these and more if you felt like you were actually witnessing a moving work of art. Seriously flawed sci-fi movies like 'Forbidden Planet' and 'Close Encounters' are nonetheless enjoyable because you're watching the raw artistry of a story told by a moving camera.But you can't forgive this movie for wasting its philosophy and artistry in favor of cheap tricks and audience flagellation. I had the uncomfortable feeling that I was watching an action-film template that had been superimposed upon what was once a good idea. This movie has more in common with the empty, action-fed Schwarzenegger 'identity' movies ('Total Recall', 'The 6th Day', etc.) than it does with other great sci-fi titles.It is visually impressive, and I am sure a great deal of time was spent on the aspects of daily life in the 2050s. But sets and gadgets can only take you so far, and it wasn't far enough.There is very little artistry in this movie, and very little that is worthwhile that you can't get from a two-line summary of the set-up.",5,1,3,27 June 2003
As Good as It Gets," An enjoyable, unexpected pleasure
","With Jack Nicholson playing this role, the script writes itself. He is still one of the best actors of his generation, pulling off some sketchy dialogue and awkward scenes with the ease of a hand magician. He takes this movie on his shoulders and carries it almost all the way through.I don't get Helen Hunt. She has her moments - her scenes with Nicholson as he tries to complement her are priceless - but she just doesn't have the emotional range to pull it off. She tries, but her high-profile scenes don't ring true. She was upstaged by Greg Kinnear for Christ's sake - and SHE was naked!Well directed for the most part - there are some pacing problems, and this movie falls victim to 'great line' disease. Great pieces of dialogue are framed by clumsy directorial arrows pointing to us and it, telling us that what we're about to hear is great dialogue. Still, it IS great dialogue. Overall, this is an enjoyable, unexpected pleasure.",8,0,0,3 July 2000
The Fifth Element," It's just a tarted up action movie
","At it's core, it's another action movie. An above average one, to be sure. But it's dressed up to be as bizarre as possible. But only the details are bizarre, like Gary Oldman's southern accent or Luke Perry showing up in a bit part. The trouble I have with it is that it's deliberately strange. They were trying too hard to be 'out there' and as a result it comes off as more normal than they might have intended.",6,0,1,8 February 1999
Catch-22," Well shot, badly written
","Shifting, mind-bending flashbacks and unbelievably complex filming sequences move Mike Nichols into the Director's Techniques Hall of Fame. Consider the first sequence, with B-29s taking off on a small island while Yossarian, Cathcart and Korn are all acting out an unheard scene in a burned out building somewhere in the shot. Notice the planes flying in the background with Yossarian in the foreground. The entire shot is amazing.As for the movie, well, the tone is right and the mood is right - it's very similar to Orson Welles's attempt at Kafka's 'The Trial.' It's not Nichols's fault that the script is mostly flat and plodding (Buck Henry also conceived of and wrote for TV's Get Smart - not a damnation in itself, but just worthy of note). It's partially his fault that most of the characters come across as cartoonish throwaways - like Nurse Duckett, McWatt, and Bob Newhart's Major Major Major Major.But it's definitely his fault that the audience is unprepared for the wackiness of things like the Minderbinder Cartel when it first appears, or the Nately's Whore storyline. By about halfway through, the movie turns into a expressionist nightmare, just like in 'The Trial' - again, not a bad thing in itself (watch the background events as Yossarian walks through the streets at night) - but we are unprepared for it, having already gone through the majestic aerial scenes and the absurd prostitution scenes.",7,1,7,24 August 2000
Romeo + Juliet," Intriguing and clever, but maybe too clever
","I like cross-period staging for Shakespeare - like Ian McKellen's Richard III or Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet. It always gives a good perspective on the strength of the underlying story. It can also be said that it gives the director something to do - like a post-WWI staging of Much Ado About Nothing - other than trot out the same costumes as from the last production.I thought this version was very clever, but maybe more clever than it needed to be. The swimming pool scene (in place of the balcony scene), for example, was an inspired choice. The interaction was much more immediate: standing at a balcony is a scene designed for a stage, not for a movie. But the sense of the scene is also lost. By this time in the movie, the two have already fallen in the deepest love they will ever have (whatever that means - lust is more like it), and the action falls from there. But the play implies much more of a process, instead of proof. The balcony scene is that of two lovers parted by circumstance, both literally and figuratively. The meaning is changed, though subtly, and not necessarily for the better.I didn't like many of the start-stop and fast-forward camera tricks, not because they are a bad idea in themselves, but because the style negates the scenes they were intended to augment. I especially did not like the faux dramatic echoing noises. There's no need for these tricks. I also found the second half of the movie to be rather tame in terms of technique. Most of the shots after the swimming pool scene are rather bland and ordinary. It was as if the director had used up all of his tricks and couldn't think of any others.All I can say is thank God that Shakespeare's language was used. Without the language there is no reason for this movie to even be made - it turns the story from a ludicrous mob war to the intriguing version of RJ it is now.",7,1,2,4 June 2000
Forrest Gump," Suffers from directorial influence
","The best thing in this movie is Gary Sinise. He growls, smirks, and spits his way through a terrific performance before his character is converted to Forrest's religion. Other than that, there's not much meat in this movie. I thought Hanks was pretty good as Gump, but it's not a role that you can screw up too badly because there's very little character to slip into.
The biggest problem with it is the artificial, plastic directing job, something that other Zamekis productions suffer from also. The sequence of dying Lt. Dan ancestors is particularly egregious - it's supposed to be funny, I think, but doesn't quite make it. I'm also at a loss to explain why we needed the Gump within a Gump voiceover narration. It only adds to the syrupy tone with the kind of pseudo-humor you see in many TV commercials. This story could have told itself quite well without this and similar directorial tricks.I was a little bit bothered by the right-wing sensibilities present, but not all that much. I'm used to the co-opting of counter-culture product to prove alternate ideals (like the idea behind John Lennon's 'Imagine'). Using a false history as a dramatic device is OK with me, just do something interesting with it. Hollywood has a tendency to de-legitimize creativity as merely the accident of situation. Zamekis has done this before in Back to the Future, where Chuck Berry supposedly gets his inspiration for 'Johnny B. Good' from one performance (instead of years of hard work). I hate it when this is used for a joke - and not a very good one, usually. Just like many things in this movie, it's pandering to the nostalgia of the audience. Similar things are done to Bear Bryant. But I digress.The best scene in the movie is when Hanks sees Sinise at the dock and runs into the water to greet him. It sums up both characters beautifully. And despite (or maybe because of) the heavy borrowing from other movies, other good scenes are the barroom scene with Hanks and Sinise, the orgasm scene, and the initial meeting of Hanks and his Drill Sergeant. I mention these because they don't typify the piled-on heavy sentiment that the rest of the movie employs.",4,2,4,12 October 1999
American Beauty," Too self-important for its own good - but it's good anyway
","I hesitate to add another comment for this movie (over 1000), but I'd like to remember the way I'm feeling right now.This is a good movie, worth the time watching it, but be prepared to be manipulated and maneuvered around by a story that reaches further than it can grasp. Director Mendes tries to make it all seem very very (very) important, but it's still just a melodrama. At its best it's a version of the Hemingway short story 'The Short, Happy Life of Francis Macomber'; at its worst, it's an episode of any soap opera. I can't understand how the screenplay won an award - wait, yes I can.God, but the whole thing is so aware of its own importance ('what you're watching is CINEMA, you stupid viewer'); it's so self-aggrandizing it makes me want to puke. I wish it didn't have this attitude because Kevin Spacey is as good as he's ever been and Annette Bening is acting her butt off. I wish a lot of things - like this film should have had the guts to admit the story was really about Ricky, the more interesting storyline; like it should have spent a little less time on the superfluous dream sequences, and a little more time on the development of the abundance of two-dimensional characters; and I wish we would have been able to see the REAL reason Lester had 'changed' - it's not because of cheerleaders - and somewhere, someone involved with this film knows it. But has yet to let us in on it.If you've read this far, you may be surprised to learn that I gave this movie an 8. Sometimes acting only takes you so far, but in this case it was the whole thing - the cast is so incredibly impressive that it's worth watching.",8,0,0,29 June 2000
Cross of Iron," Excellent movie, war or otherwise - (possible spoiler)
","Maybe the best acting James Coburn has done in his entire career  as the soldier who both hates war and can't live without it. He's either crazy or tongue-tied when he's not a part of the war and it brings him his only happiness. But, as he says, he hates all officers, even those who are on his side. David Warner is also excellent in an alarmingly small role.I was transfixed with Peckinpah's editing in the battle sequences and the hospital scenes - the two are ominously similar. Many directors have borrowed from this style of filming and I can see why. It's confusing, disorienting, and it puts you in the action as one of the characters trying to make sense of it all.--- POSSIBLE SPOILER!! ---As for the ending, well... It makes sense in the context of the movie only because of the two ideologies crashing in on Coburn at the same time. Does he realize that he's abandoned everything he's believed in while he laughs hysterically? I would love to discuss the ending of this movie, my e-mail is above.A clue might be in the photograph that appears like a slide show through the ending credits. We see a German soldier stringing up a prisoner to be hanged in the first shot. Then we see a wider angle view of the picture and realize that this prisoner is stringing up another prisoner at the same time.",8,0,0,5 October 1999
Good Will Hunting," Van Sant is the real star
","I had a real problem with the sentimentality of this movie. It drips with string-tugging melodrama and amateurish characterizations. The only movies that can get away with such tortured pop psychology were all made by Alfred Hitchcock.I liked Minnie Driver and Ben Affleck, accent or no (it's hard to tell), and Robin Williams was OK. Matt Damon's character is so depressingly obvious that it's difficult to sit through his journey to self-awareness, and the epiphany scene is just embarrassing.But I can't say enough about Gus Van Sant and his deceptively transparent direction. Somehow he makes the flat script come alive with just a few touches. Notice how he uses the stationary and panning shots - and how he frames each image to make it vital. This is especially true for the scenes with Driver. I'm not a Van Sant fan, but I think he really lifted this movie up by its wet corners and tried his best to give it life.",7,2,5,25 August 2000
The Godfather: Part III," Ponderous and self-indulgent
","Extremely disappointing given that it's supposed to be a 'III' for the first two. Taken by itself, it's just not a good movie.While the first two episodes are entertaining and spontaneous self-contained tragedies, this one is a ponderous epilogue for the entire story. Instead of a separate story to tell, this movie tries to fill in the previous stories with post-70s psychological motivations, like a middle-aged man looking back on his life and career when he should be focusing on his present life. It's not fun to watch.",6,1,3,1 October 2000
The Woman in Black," Not spooky, not scary, not creepy, and worst of all, not interesting
","Attempting a creepy vibe, this movie doesn't succeed. Instead of building the creep factor, it only manages to build impatience.In the first 10 minutes, the scene is set perfectly for a good old fashioned ghost story. And for some reason, the next hour is devoted to little except maddeningly tedious scene-setting ambiance. Blinking shadows, clattering mechanical toys, and faces in the window, during which the plot is not moved forward.Radcliffe is OK, but he doesn't really show the rising levels of fright, frustration, or anything really that might have made the sequences useful. A better actor (or more experienced, if you like) would be able to come unhinged at least a little bit and make the movie more interesting, even if just for those 40 minutes. The role calls for someone who can carry this movie alone, and he's not there.As for the ending, I'll just say this: the resolution comes all too easily and the 'plot' seemed ultimately pointless, with the end a complete mushy letdown. Not spooky, not scary, not creepy, and worst of all, not interesting.",4,3,4,25 June 2012
