3:10 to Yuma," A drama of morality and redemption within a Western--superbly done.
","Christian Bales and Russell Crowe are perfectly cast as the protagonists in this Western, as their respective characters seek redemption for their lifetime of failure and evil, respectively. Christian Bale's performance is especially riveting, as you come to know the character portrayed in the very depth of his soul. He finds redemption in his relationship with the villain Wade(Russell Crowe)and in his heroic behavior within the story. So, too, does the villain Wade, who finds his own redemption in his relationship with Dan (Christian Bale) and his final decision to give closure to the elder son. There is sufficient humanity and, indeed, humor in the portrayals by these characters, who are ably supported by the rest of the cast. This is a Western that can be enjoyed by serious film-goers who normally bypass this genre, and these same film-goers will regret missing this one if they do.",9,3,6,16 October 2007
Million Dollar Baby," Technical issues are obstacle to greatness
","Beautifully acted, Million Dollar Baby nonetheless suffers from some technical deficiencies that render it among the 'might have been' films of history. First, the champion 'Blue Bear' in the climax championship fight would have been disqualified, and very likely charged with criminal assault. Second, in the Nursing home, if a monitor is turned off, an alarm goes off at the Nurses' station--that in fact would be how they knew that Maggie Fitzerald had bitten her tongue. Third, this Nursing home was allegedly providing good care; yet the gangrene-caused amputation would not have been needed if the patient was provided with appropriate exercise (e.g. Christopher Reeve). Finally, Frankie Dunn's fingerprints would have been on the breathing tube; the surge in adrenalin would have been discovered at autopsy, and he would then be a fugitive in a murder case.Hollywood finds liberal issues attractive, such as the euthanasia applied to Maggie, and this film will no doubt receive a number of academy awards--perhaps even best picture--but is over-rated. Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank turned in superb performances, and any awards they receive are deserving. The film itself disappoints, and it is a shame. None of the technical issues noted above needed to be there.",7,2,3,28 January 2005
American Gangster," Superb performances with a compelling story
","This movie has a compelling story, was well directed, superbly cast, and contains performances that will challenge for awards for best actor and supporting actor and actress. Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington were able to overcome their star-power and actually become their portrayed characters to the audience, and Ms. Nadal was a delightful surprise. Not only is she a beautiful woman, but conveyed emotions in a subtle, yet powerful way that is cherished by the camera. Ruby Dee gives a powerful performance, which we expected, and should challenge for supporting actress. Josh Brolin was also a pleasant surprise--already more compelling than James, his portrayal will challenge for supporting actor. This movie will challenge for 'Best Picture,' 'Best Director,' 'Best Screenplay,' as well as the actor awards noted. We will be astonished if it doesn't bring home at least three academy awards.",10,1,7,6 November 2007
The Bourne Supremacy," Compelling story, decent performances in this deju vu thriller
","Matt Damon does a credible job with this Ludlum tale. The story works, is compelling, and lives up to the novel to the extent that a movie should. The movie works, but could have been so much better if the director had not overdone the rapid-fire flashback fragments, which put an annoying staccato into the film. For some viewers, this staccato will become a major distraction and annoyance.The chase scene is thrilling, well done for the most part, but goes on far too long and loses some validity as a result.Stay tuned for yet another, for there is still a villain outstanding on the Russian side, which will provide a sedgway for yet another offering.",6,0,1,6 August 2004
