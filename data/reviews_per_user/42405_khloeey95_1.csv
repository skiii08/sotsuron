The Mask," A Favourite From My Childhood!
","I'm writing this as I watch this film for what could be the hundredth time (or possibly more since I've been told that me and my friend used to ask to watch this every day, after school, when we were really little), and I just have to say that this will always be a favourite film of mine. Always. I think this must be the first film that I ever saw that starred Jim Carrey and since then, I've considered Carrey to be one of my favourite actors of all time (alongside Robin Williams). You can't help but love how wacky, and lovably quirky, he is in this film! I know that should I have kids in the future, I will definitely have to show them this film - who knows, they might even love it as much as I do!It's funny, crazy, hilarious, amazing, enjoyable, and seriously epic to watch! Favourite moments/scenes/quotes (from The Mask):1) His first transformation with the mask. (And when he says 'Look ma, I'm roadkill. Ha-ha-HA!' - I would find this so funny when I was little).
2) His singing and dancing scenes (with Cameron Diaz's character, and his rendition of 'Cuban Pete' with the police).
3) His scene in the park with Cameron Diaz's character when he says something along the lines of 'J'adore, j'adore, shut the window, I don't care!' (I'm not at this scene just yet and can't remember the line exactly as it is, but I always found it hilarious).
4) And the scenes in the casino where he gives a speech for 'winning an award', asks 'Did you miss me..? I guess not!!', and when he swallows the dynamite and exclaims 'That's a spicy meatball!' with an accent.There are numerous moments in The Mask that are noteworthy, alongside the ones I've listed above, and just as funny and great to watch. If you haven't seen this film, I would truly recommend that you watch it as soon as possible. If you love comedy and really want to have a laugh, then this would be a great choice!",10,9,9,28 June 2018
