The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Feminist and Communist Revolution
","When I first watched the Hunger Games movies, I pictured Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence's character) as a kind of modern-day 'Robin Hood'. Through her mastery of the bow-and-arrow and through her brilliance as a tactician, Katniss Everdeen becomes an inspiration to millions of poor people who are being oppressed by a tyrannical government.Yes, I really did try hard to like the Hunger Games for what it was. Unfortunately, by the time I got to this third instalment, I found it almost impossible to ignore all the modern-day progressive propaganda that these films were pushing.I apologize to the Hunger Games' fans. I know a lot of young people have been inspired by the these movies, just like many young people have been inspired by Communism. But as an avid moviegoer, I think it is important to analyze the messages being conveyed by the movies you watch, and not just blindly (subconsciously) soak them in.As far as I can tell, the Hunger Game movies are promoting every progressive agenda on the planet: violent communist revolution, hatred for the rich, moral indifference, affirmative action and radical feminism, to name just a few. In this latest instalment of the Hunger Games, we see Katniss Everdeen completing the Communist revolution that she unintentionally began in the first two movies. She becomes the leader of her rebel movement. She uses the media to ignite rebellion among the people. She inspires them to fight against their Capitalist overlords. She really does become a modern-day Che Guevara.While the Communist propaganda in Hunger Games is very overt and obvious, the feminist propaganda is more subtle. We see Lawrence's character constantly out-witting, out-thinking and physically dominating her male competitors.Katniss is ambitious, cunning and ruthless. She will do anything to achieve her goals, even if it means manipulating (or outright betraying) the men in her life. Through her ruthlessness she achieves political power and becomes a hero to all women who want to be freed from (fictional) male oppression. She is a Feminist dream.If you're a radical progressive, then, by all means, go watch this movie. On a superficial level it will appeal to you because it is a great action movie. But it will also appeal to you on a much deeper, subconscious level; because underneath the surface it is radically affirming all of your deeply held progressive values.In other words, it's a great piece of propaganda.",Null,32,57,17 November 2014
Se7en," What the heck?
","This movie is filled with ridiculous references to Catholicism. I remember watching it as a teenager and I completely did not notice it at the time. This is a sick movie (on so many levels) and I am not just talking about the gore.Gwyneth Paltrow's character wants to abort her unborn baby. She doesn't like the violent city (New York) she and her husband have moved to; and is worried about raising their child in that city. What a good reason to have an abortion! Morgan Freeman's character talks her out of it. Apparently, Morgan's character convinced his wife to have an abortion and 'later regretted it'.The decision by Paltrow's character ends up being a mistake, because she (and her baby) are gruesomely murdered at the end of the movie. But this is only the beginning of the Catholic-related absurdity...The killer in this movie is a crazed Catholic, who decides to gruesomely kill and torture seven people after reading a book by St. Thomas Aquinas; one of the most gentle and brilliant men who ever lived. This includes - ironically - the unborn baby mentioned previously.This is a sick movie made by a director who - for some reason - felt the need to insult the Catholic Church. He must have been schooled by Scorsese.",Null,2,4,15 November 2014
Interstellar," More Typical Hollywood Ideology put to Film...
","Hot off the heels of the scientifically impossible Lucy, comes 'Interstellar': another movie that worships science and implies that one day it will turn us all into gods; gods who can control our own destiny.For those of you who don't know what motivated Hollywood to make this movie, I will try to explain. The Baby Boomers, the generation that gave us Star Trek and Buck Rogers, were convinced that space travel would solve all the world's problems.Technological advancement would eventually allow us to travel to distant galaxies. We would meet aliens. These aliens would be atheist-socialist-geniuses who would show us even more advanced technology than our own. The new alien technology would allow us to overcome death and live in perfect happiness. But, more importantly, they would prove to us - once and for all - that there is no God. Humans are the most advanced life forms in the universe, and they will eventually achieve God-like power as long as they continue to do scientific research. Now, none of these wild fantasies of the Star-Trek-Generation have come true. In fact, the more we learn about the universe the more we are beginning to see: 1) We seem to be alone 2) We will likely never travel beyond our own solar system 3) The universe was very likely started by an intelligence.Technological advancement has not occurred as fast as many Boomers were hoping and has failed to fulfill their grandiose fantasies. In order to compensate for these sobering realities, the Baby Boomers have modified their fantasies. The reason science has not advanced is because people don't think scientific advancement is important, especially those evil religious people!Fortunately, the evil corporations (evil capitalists) are destroying our planet through global warming and environmental abuse. Eventually the planet will be so damaged we will have to find another one. When we do this, the Boomer fantasies will finally be fulfilled. Besides the usual environmental and scientific propaganda, the movie also contains your typical feminist propaganda. The movie begins on a farm where Matthew McConaughey is talking to his daughter and son. Before the conversation even began, I knew the daughter was going to be a genius and the son was going to be a moron. I am not kidding. I have witnessed the 'boy-idiot, girl-genius' paradigm so often that I no longer expect anything different. Affirmative action (both for women and minorities) is inevitable, and, quite frankly, I am getting tired of it. This is coming from a person of colour (really).If there are going to be brilliant scientists in movies you can practically guarantee that one of them will be female and the other will be a minority. I use to applaud these efforts in shows like Star Trek, but now I am just getting annoyed by them",Null,5,9,16 November 2014
