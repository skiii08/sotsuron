It," Worth watching even though not scary
",Now compared from the first IT movie produced in 1990 I can say they tried to put a different spend on it but it does not come as close to the original. Worth watching.,7,0,1,30 August 2019
Captain Marvel," A+ for plot direction and for bring back the 90s era
","To be honest I was not looking forward to watching this movie at all until I saw Captain Marvel play in the Avengers Endgame movie. I went into this movie with an open mind and to my surprise it was not at all that bad of a movie like most people were saying. If it was not for Samuel L Jackson saving this movie from being a disaster and for being in every scene, then this movie would've sucked big time because Brie Larson playing Captain Marvel was not that interesting. it was dull, boring and had an attitude in every movie shot which made it hard to connect to this character. If you can get pass the direction this film was going with the perceived feminism empowerment... yawn... that is more irritating than impowering, this movie can be worthwatching.",7,3,5,16 October 2019
Us," Jordan Peele Failed as a Director if You as the Viewer are Left With More Unanswered Questions
","This movie did start off good but got confusing when it started messing around with the supernatural that is a doppelg√§nger. I get it, you want to make something fresh and new but for me watching this movie was a huge let down. This movie just left more questions for me that needed answering and the director failed big time if the viewer has to look up information to understand the movie better which should've been explained in the 2 hours length time of this movie. For instance why did the doppelganger just walk up the escalator to the other world way before young Adelaide was captured by her evil doppelganger and switched bodies? What is the significant point of the rabbits hopping all over the ending? The director failed to explain why Adelaide's double, Red can barely talk which I learned by researching the evil one chocked her but in the movie it was not even addressed and how did she get out of those handcuffs as a little girl? What was the point of them ( the doppelgangers) killing everyone if they were just going to hold hands at the end of movie? There is no reason for this. If Jordan Peele makes a part 2 to this movie he better step up his Director skills or hire more director who can check him because the second part will be a huge flop.",4,1,5,28 September 2019
Avengers: Endgame," I really enjoyed this movie. It tied up everything and answered all questions from pervious movies
","I do not see why everyone was giving the plot of this movie a 1 or 2 star. I can say watching this movie for 3 hours, it tied up all the previous movies all in one bow and left no questions unanswered. I think some viewers wanted more death scenes but for me I was truly satisfied and entertained since watching all the marvel movies at the start of first Ironman. You will definitely try to hold back some tears which I was good at but this movie will try to make you cry. Hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did since this is the last avengers saga.",9,2,5,28 September 2019
Get Out," Good movie and worth watching with great character development
",To be honest I waited until this movie came on the small screen before viewing it. I can tell you this movie was one of the best I have seen in many years and a stand along from the normal thriller genre. Jordan Peele took this movie to another level by adding a different twist to the story line. Directors this is how you make an interesting movie and do take notes. You can tell there was much thought put into this movie from the characters to the setting and telling the story of why things were done the way it was in this movie. I highly recommend watching this movie as I truly enjoyed . Keep up the good work Jordan and don't just put out boring movies just to make some quick cash like other directors have done in the past.,9,2,7,30 August 2019
