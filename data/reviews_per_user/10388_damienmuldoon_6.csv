Walk the Line," all about the acting
","You don't have to be a fan of country music or Johnny Cash to enjoy this movie. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon give the best performances of the year in a biopic that gets behind the image of its subject to portray a tortured, and often unpleasant, man. There are obvious similarities between this movie and 'Ray' the life story of Ray Charles. This is a better movie though and that is due purely to the outstanding on screen relationship of Phoenix and Witherspoon. Joaquin Phoenix just about reaches that pinnacle of becoming more like Johnny Cash than Cash himself. In much the same way as Val Kilmer occupied the character of Jim Morrison in 'The Doors'. Reese Witherspoon gives is a feisty June Carter who's sheer energy carries the movie at moments when it may seem to flag. The depiction of Cash's struggle to make it as a singer is very real and doesn't indulge in the overnight success story so many biopics portray. This is a thoroughly engaging movie that I will definitely be adding to my DVD collection as soon as it is released.",7,0,1,23 May 2006
Troy," surprisingly entertaining
","This movie suffers somewhat from negative publicity. Before it even hit the cinemas critics were writing it off. Never one to accept the critics views at face value, I went along to the cinema to check it out for myself. I have to say I found in thoroughly entertaining. It makes Homer's epic poem very accessible and fulfills the role of great escapist cinema very well. Brad Pitt is perfectly cast as Achilles and there are also memorable performances from Brendan Gleeson and Peter O Toole. Orlando Bloom and Eric Banna let the movie down slightly. I can just never take Orlando Bloom seriously. He'll never play anything other than romantic leads. The battle scenes are particularly powerful and some of the cinematography is quite breathtaking. Especially the thousand Greek ships sailing for Troy to bring back Helen. When it was released on DVD I bought it immediately.So don't be dissuaded by the critics, this movie is well worth renting at least.",8,15,27,1 August 2005
Lost in Translation," just lost
","Someone, please explain to me what this film is about. And while you're at it, also explain what a great and funny actor like Bill Murray is doing in it? From the moment the opening credits roll and Scarlet Johnsen's 'sheer pantied' bottom dominates the screen, (and what was that all about by the way) to Tokyo by neon lights and the closing credits, I kept wondering when this film would start. And there are other moments when the action was so slow that I feared the whole movie might grind to a stop. At least if it had, I might have gotten my money back. It would be impossible to include a spoiler in reviewing this film because there is nothing to spoil. Was there not meant to be a plot or did I just not get it? Perhaps, a middle aged man and a neglected young wife wandering around Tokyo together was the plot. They might have at least had an affair. But no. Instead they just keep meeting each other and having meaningless conversations. I know this movie has won awards but I cannot for the life of me see why. It is definitely one to miss. Although it must have had a hell of a publicity team working on it. Because if you read the reviews you might be forgiven for thinking that it is a modern classic like...well, there isn't another movie to compare it to. Anyway, if you are swayed by the reviews and decide to rent it, make sure you also rent a good film to watch after it. If you're still awake, or have the will to live.",2,0,3,16 November 2005
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," Irish war of independence and civil war told realistically
","It is impossible to review this film without making references to Neil Jordan's 'Michael Collins', so I'll get the comparisons out of the way. This is a far better film. There is none of the romance that became a little hard to stomach in Jordan's film, and thankfully, no Julia Roberts. As an Irish person, I could actually feel the sting of race memory while I watched some of the film's bitterest scenes. You don't have to be Irish though to know what this film is all about and why so many reviewers were uncomfortable with it. It is set in County Cork and the rural environment creates a stark atmosphere, similar to that captured in Mel Gibson's 'Braveheart'. In fact, this movie has greater similarities to Gibson's Scottish epic than Neil Jordan's biopic of Michael Collins. Killian Murphy gives a wonderful performance as Damien, a medical student whose principles lead him away from medicine into a world of guerrilla warfare. Watch out for how well Murphy plays being passive.His character is anything but passive. Yet Killian Murphy finds that other level to portray a truly three dimensional role. There are fine performances from Liam Cunningham and Orla Fitzgerald also. There are times when this movie has the quality of a 'fly-on-the-wall' documentary to it. This effect makes the violence more disturbing and realistic. It isn't all about guns and beatings though. The dialog is scripted in such a way as to make some of the more ambiguous issues in the Irish Civil War and struggle for freedom very clear. I could talk about this film all night. Just go and see it.",9,10,28,6 July 2006
The Da Vinci Code," this is a good movie
","By now, your head will probably be scrambled with the mixture of reviews this movie has gotten. It suffers from hype and that is the only element detracting from it. When a movie generates as much publicity as this one has, too many critics can't wait to slate it. Interestingly, the negative reviews concentrate on childish things like Tom Hanks's hair. Which leads me to believe that if you are looking for faults, they can always be found. Ignore the reviews (even this one)though and just go and see this stylish thriller. The plot sticks quite closely to Dan Brown's novel and holds the audience's interest in the same way. Hanks and the beautiful Audery Tatou work well together without trying to create chemistry. The supporting cast all put in descent performances, although Jan Reno's considerable talents maybe a little waisted as the stereotypical French Detective. There are moments of humor too. But, like the novel, the purpose of this film is to get you thinking. Even though I found the religious theories a bit far fetched, this is still the most entertaining movie I've seen this year.",8,4,7,22 May 2006
Atonement," over-hyped
","I have to admit that it was hype and hype alone which encouraged me to go and see this movie. For weeks, every newspaper and TV show had reports and clips of how 'great' the movie was. Also, it was directed by the same man who did 'Charles ii the Power and the Passion' for BBC television and that is one of the best period dramas to be made in the last twenty years. So off I went to the cinema with high expectations. Then reality set in. There are three distinct parts to this movie. The beginning, which is too long. The middle, which is too abstract and the end, which is too predictable and makes huge sections of the middle obsolete. Yes, there is some fabulous cinematography and the performances are mannered and well directed. But the story gets lost somewhere. Perhaps it just got buried beneath the mounds of pretentious camera work and over-the-top attempts to create upper class British characters from the 1930s. I've not read the novel so I can't comment on how good or bad an adaptation it is. But as a piece of cinema, it disappoints.",5,18,36,22 October 2007
