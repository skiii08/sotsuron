Miracle," Exciting
","Wow!  A good action sports movie.  Nice camera work during the practices and games.  Watched that game in 1980 and remember Al Michael's 'Do you believe in miracles? YES!!'  Along with the scene of Jim Craig searching out his father after the game with the flag draped on his shoulder. 
Despite knowing the outcome of the game, this movie still grabbed me and drew me into it as if I did not know what happened (reminiscent of 'Apollo 13').  Nice to see the movie show how hard team USA had to work and practice and how Herb Brooks chose the players to represent the U.S. in the Olympics.
The supporting cast also was quite good with their performances, collectively might be worth a mention as best supporting actors when next years awards season comes around.",8,0,0,23 February 2004
The Hunger Games," Why was this movie necessary?
","Maybe I just 'don't 'get it', but in this time of school shootings such as Columbine, Virginia Tech and others, why is this movie even created? It almost seems to glamorize 'kids killing other kids', although that is usually the case in any war or war movies where most of the combatants are young adults.I did not know anything about the books, and still have not read them, nor do I intend to. My grand-daughters 10 and 12 said that 'Hunger Games' is what they wanted to see during Spring break. They have both read the book. They both liked the movie, but I feel that the theme of this movie is better for older teens and adults.As for the acting, okay, but not outstanding.I agree that the shaky hand-held camera is a terrible effect. I don't know who started the trend, but remember that Steven Spielberg used that technique in 'Saving Private Ryan' and I did not like it then or any of the following movies I have seen where it is used The most recent James Bond movie was perhaps the worst for this technique.",5,7,12,10 April 2012
Interstellar," Okay, but not great
","I found this movie slow and tedious in the first 20 minutes or so and at times during the rest of the movie. I also thought the last quarter or so of the film was bizarre. As for the soundtrack, nothing special. I did appreciate that a lot of philosophical questions arise as one watches this movie regarding humans place in the universe and the physical size of the universe and time. On the other hand, I also had the feeling that I was watching an updated version of '2001, A Space Odyssey' particularly with the sequence through the wormhole in this movie versus the Stargate in 2001. Also the similarity of the rectangular shapes of the robots to the obelisk, and a few other minor similarities. All in all, I felt this movie was okay, but far from great, and probably will not watch it again unlike some other sci-fi movies including the aforementioned '2001, A Space Odyssey'.",6,2,4,3 December 2014
Man of Steel," Not as good as the Christopher Reeve Superman I and II
","This movie was entertaining, but the story was not as interesting to me as in Superman I and II with Christopher Reeve. I also think Superman's personality was captured better by Reeve than in this one.I will say that I think this film was better than Superman III and IV that Reeve starred in, and also the 'Superman Returns' version which was too over the top and not credible.Rather than a straight line from the decaying Planet Krypton to his adult life, I found the flash backs to his youth more distracting than enlightening. Kind of broke up the storyline in my opinion.Another thing this version lacks is the stirring musical score that John Williams composed for the Reeve versions of Superman.To sum up, decent but not a block buster.",6,2,6,2 July 2013
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Interesting, but not as good as Terminator 2
","While this film was interesting, and imaginative with the large crane in the chase scene, I felt that it went a little over the top a few times and was not as engaging or spellbinding as Terminator 2.   Hopefully this will be the last of this series, since it is unlikely that any improvement will occur in any future sequels.  I think the story line has reached its conclusion unlike the James Bond series which seems to keep on rolling along.",6,0,0,26 July 2003
Dunkirk," Good, but not great
","Perhaps the greatest human evacuation of all time when considering the amount of soldiers and sailors saved and the adverse conditions, this movie handles the story fairly well. It is a good movie, but not great. It is interesting and shows what conditions were like for some of the combatants/evacuees. This rescue saved so many soldiers who were able to return to battle later in the war it is remarkable, because the Nazis had superior equipment and manpower at the time. It did not show enough of the rear guard protecting the evacuation by stalling the Nazi drive long enough for the flotilla of boats to save so many people.",6,4,8,1 August 2017
The Pianist," Not as good as 'Schindler's List'
","A nice supplement to 'Schindler's List' showing what happened to some of the victims of the Holocaust who were not saved by Schindler.
The story was interesting, but the movie itself is well short of matching 'Schindler's List' quality as a movie.",7,0,0,29 January 2003
The Pianist," A good supplement to Schindler's List
","This movie is a good supplement to 'Schindler's List' in that it follows one of the many individuals that was not saved by Schindler or some other mercenary, and had to endure all the hardships of WWII in Warsaw.  It gives a good viewpoint of what happened to one of the many survivors who lived through the Holocaust in Poland.While I consider this film good, I feel that 'Schindler's List' is much more compelling, and an over-all better movie.  I gave  'Schindler's List' a 10 (1 of only 3 films I have given a '10') whereas this movie I think merits only a '7'.Even now, a few years later, I am still haunted and moved by the scenes and story of 'Schindler's List', but do not feel nearly that amount of emotion from seeing 'The Pianist' just a few days ago.  My feelings for 'Sophie's Choice' (another film about one person in WWII and her dealings with the Nazis) that I saw several years ago are stronger than for 'The Pianist'.
A good film, but not truly great.",7,0,0,31 January 2003
Hidden Figures," Amazing story from the 60s
","This is a good movie, but the amazing part is the story it depicts. Growing up during the space race, I was not aware until now how many women were involved in the early years of NASA as mathematicians and engineers. Well told story of the three main women characters and not only the problems they had to solve to help the U.S. put a person in space, but the ongoing problems of segregation in the 1960s. The ladies portrayed in the movie (and many more not shown) had to be special to perform as they did despite all the obstacles of race thrown up at them. Wonder why it took so long afterward for Katherine Gabel Johnson to be recognized for her work. I must say that the Freedom Medal given to her was a well deserved and earned honor.",7,0,4,14 February 2017
Pulp Fiction," Terrible
",This movie is one of the few that I nearly walked out on it was so bad.  It was too disjointed and I could not understand the point or plot.  People were killed in one scene and then popped up in another.  Lots of gratuitous violence and brutality that did not seem to have much to do with the plot.,1,38,89,8 July 1999
Platoon," Still the Best movie ever!
","When one considers all the elements of film making: plot, acting, music, photography, directing, etc. this is the best movie ever made. It is so realistic that it brings the point home about how awful war really is.After seeing this movie, I began to appreciate how incidents such as the My-Lai massacre could occur.I feel that 'Saving Private Ryan', and the 'Longest Day' (about D-day) falls short of 'Platoon' overall.Some of the scenes such as Charley Sheen freezing from fear while watching the enemy approach through the underbrush was extraordinary and shows that one scene is worth more than 10,000 words.I first wrote the above review after seeing the movie in 1986.I have this movie on Blu-ray and even after seeing it more times than I can remember, still consider it the best movie I have ever seen. Better than 'Schindler's List' and 'Godfather' which are the only other movies I have given 10s to. Since this is such a sober and somber subject, I have to be in the mood to watch it, so unlike a lighter or more uplifting movie, have not watched it as much as a lower quality movie I like such as 'Good, Bad, and Ugly', or 'Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World' or 'Vacation'.Even now, I am still stunned by the incredible realism of the actions in the movie and usually get tears in my eyes during the latter half of the film. Perhaps I feel this way since it was my generation that lost so many good people in the Vietnam War including some friends, classmates, and neighbors not only as war casualties, but the lingering effects from Agent Orange, drug use that started during the quiet times of the conflict, etc.. I feel so lucky that I was not drafted to go there even though my draft number was in the top third of the drawing.",10,0,0,6 July 1999
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Not as good as the original with Christopher Reeve
","This movie was entertaining once it got going, but was too convoluted in the beginning for me to understand why Batman disliked Superman. I do not understand those reviews where people raved that this was the best superhero movie yet. I guess they never saw the original 'Superman' and 'Superman II' movies with Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman, et. al. Not only were those stories much more interesting, more believable, and closer to the real Action Comic Hero and associated characters, but better sound score and even the videography was better. While this movie was not a waste of time, it was not as entertaining and engrossing as it could have been. Perhaps I am getting too old for all the CGI effects, but that seemed to be basically what this movie was all about with the destruction and battle scenes, whereas more realistic action was seen in the aforementioned Superman and Superman II movies. Forget the other Superman movies after those two, they were definitely below the first 2 Superman movies and even less than this movie for entertainment value.",6,1,9,14 April 2016
