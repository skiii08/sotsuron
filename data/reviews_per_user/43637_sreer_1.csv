The Avengers," Exceeded my expectation by not murdering a group legendary comics heroes
","To the furthest expectation I didn't give this movie anything above the transformer series ,thought from the trailers it will be all boom boom etc. I did have an idea that there will be a great Iron Man comedian in the nice armor suit though, but I give it all up for Joss Whedon and his writer friends for creating an extraordinary mix of superhero gang movie. The movie frankly did have a slow start but from the point where we see Tony Stark and Thor in 'Shakespeare in the park' scene the movie hits of with a non stop action mixed with a very above average hilariousness. Every super hero even Capt.Nick gets a personal intro in the movie each of them better than the other . By the way should mention the Hulk of this movie separately, even though this was his first notable appearance as a super hero or in an action role and that too with other guys who are extremely or slightly experienced in action movies , Mark Ruffalo did stand out from most of the them. Scarlett Johansson and Robert Downey Jr. were fabulous and incredibly entertaining as usual .Chris Hemsworth proves he is better along with his buddies than alone like in his own Thor movie. Tom Hiddleston steels every scene he is in and makes his mark as a great actor. Jeremy Renner , as of for him i really feel like they did make him wait in line to the last with the least important role if there is any in the six of The Avengers. You can really pull that out from the movie. But his Hawk-eye is a brilliant display equally to others.Overall the movie is a great success in my eyes and its worth the while to wait for a sequel. Apart from all hulk is funny in this movie something you don't see everyday. A scene particularly I don't want to say which includes Tom Hiddleston and Mark Ruffalo on the start tower alone deserves all the credits the movie does.",9,3,10,30 May 2012
