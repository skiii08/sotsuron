Blade Runner 2049," Excruciating
","Beware the hype, this movie pretends to be intellectual but it really doesn't make a lot of sense and you're going to leave the cinema scratching your head wondering what it's all about, and also a lot of relief that it's finally over, this is one long slow, underwritten mess..... oh, yes, and those two or three evocative sound effects they use instead of Vangelis are going to seem really old and overused by the time you get to escape from this cinematic hell....",5,22,48,7 October 2017
Knives Out," One of the Best
","LOL, excellent humour and subverting our expectations, what didn't work in Star Wars.....!",9,0,1,23 February 2020
