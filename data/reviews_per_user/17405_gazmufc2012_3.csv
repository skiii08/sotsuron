10 Cloverfield Lane," Sometimes less is more.
","First off, I'm rating it 9/10 purely because there should have been a little more 'alien activity' rather than the last 5-10 minutes of movie. Even though it was pure intense suspense from start to near the end, it worked a bloody treat because I was on the edge of my seat wondering what the heck was going on, what was going to happen next.. John Goodman made this film what it was, a terrifying feeling of something awful about to happen around every corner. I constantly thought aliens were going to find a way in to the bunker and wreak havoc, but nope, he comes across as a little bit crazy, especially to the 2 co-stars of this movie.The score was perfect, cast and acting.. I don't think another actor could have had the same, or better impact on the overall feel of the movie. Definitely one to watch!",9,0,0,12 March 2017
Get Out," Jordan Peele has created a masterpiece!
","I watched this movie without reading the sypnosis, I'm kind of glad I did and kind of wish I had read it. At the beginning I was starting to wonder what the hell was going on. It is clear as day something is up with 'the help' around the Armitage House, the lead character must have been hypnotised for about 5 minutes before I realised it, I should have guessed with that constant noise of a spoon stirring on the inside of a cup, it was irritating the crap out of me, but that is what this film does. It gets your brain going in a way you're not really familiar with. Three taps on the cup with the spoon and BAM, the lead character hit the deck harder than an axe hits a block of wood and I was genuinely taken aback with the acting, the story line and most of all.. The score, it helped make the movie what it is. Trust me, you'll understand when you watch it. I know I'll be watching it again, very soon. I won't say any more as I don't want to spoil it too much for others but I rate this film 9, I think there could have been a little more to the film, in the basement part of the movie but I felt the movie was incredible.",9,8,18,10 March 2017
John Wick: Chapter 2," A Modern Masterpiece!
","I went to the cinema to see it on the day it was released, I wasn't really expecting much if I'm honest. I'd thought the first movie was absolutely incredible and would be extremely hard to top, oh boy was I in for a surprise.. From the very second it started, it was non stop action, at that point I genuinely got excited as it had set the tone for the rest of the film. I won't spoil it for anyone that hasn't seen it, but I highly recommend it to anyone. It was sleek, eloquent and down right enjoyable. It had a few funny one liners, but the action is 100% faultless. After I'd seen the film I actually googled 'Keanu Reeves training for John Wick 2', if you haven't.. Do it, do it now! The amount of work Keanu put in before even shooting the film was amazing, especially for a 52 year old. John Wick 2 has left me anxiously and excitedly waiting for the third and final (hoping they make more than 3 though) movie. #BabaYaga",10,6,11,8 March 2017
