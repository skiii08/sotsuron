The Blair Witch Project," What the heck was this?
","I have seen many horror flicks, but this has to be the worst hyped up sham I have ever seen.  If your going,  do yourself a favor and take a dramamine. The constant jerking of the camera to give this film a realistic camcorder look made me sea sick.  The theater was full and at the end there were people booing. Scary ?  Not in the least. As cheesy as The Haunting was,  it made me jump a little.  Realistic ?  Well,  maybe the dialog,  with every other word F--- or Bull----.  That type of dialog usually attempts to cover a bad film in shock.  It may reflect some peoples vocabulary.  I am so disappointed.  I really had hoped to see a new genre of HORROR.  On the other hand,  I guess I did, it was horrible.  My Rating : 4 Turds",Null,1,3,2 August 1999
