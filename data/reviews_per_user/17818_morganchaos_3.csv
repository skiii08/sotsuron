Requiem for a Dream," Utterly Incomprehensible.
","Maybe you have to be high to see this. Seriously.I've watched this movie four times now, and I got nothing out of it, other than it's got a love story in there somewhere, and it's a cautionary tale about drugs. Oh, and the guy's mother goes on amphetamines (that's not a spoiler, happens within the first half hour and I think it was in the trailer) to lose weight. And gets addicted. Just like her son, who's addicted to heroin. And her son's best friend, who's addicted to heroin. And her son's girlfriend, who - SURPRISE! - is addicted to heroin. Am I sensing a pattern? I would not recommend renting or buying this movie. It's an okay way to kill a few hours if someone else has it, but don't waste money on it, unless you intend to take acid or smoke at least four joints before every single time you watch, because that's the only way I can think of to make this movie enjoyable. 3 out of 10 for looking pretty and having good performances, but nothing could save this screenplay or directing.",3,1,4,31 December 2007
Marie Antoinette," Aesthetically pleasing, but utterly plot less
","I walked out of this movie after the first two hours of pretty pictures and no plot. I hear a lot of people talking about how it's a sensitive portrayal of Marie Antoinette's life and how great a job Sofia Coppola did with it. I am not seeing this at all. Valiant efforts are given by all involved, but it doesn't cover up a vapid, badly written script and some poor casting choices.The movie touches on various events in Marie Antoinette's life, but it doesn't string them together. Many things seem random and disconnected, pointless, or only there for filler. I expected much better from Sofia Coppola.If you have the stomach to sit through 2+ hours of pretty pictures, with no coherent plot, then by all means, see or rent this. If you need something to sink your teeth into, skip it and watch a documentary.",4,1,2,24 November 2006
Enemy at the Gates," Horrible.
","I hated this movie. War movies are difficult to pull off as it is, at least historical ones, but this one fails more miserably than any I've seen. There are some okay moments. There's a few good moments between actors, and occasionally you can get the tension of the cat-and-mouse game of the two snipers. However, the rest is terrible. It's all war scenes, with one drinking scene and one sex scene. There's no chemistry between Jude Law and Rachel Weisz, and this is the probably the main reason why the sex scene is so weak and distasteful. It seems a little like a last-ditch attempt to say both 'Look! These characters really do have a relationship! They're having sex!' as well as 'Look! It really is hard for these characters! They're having sex on a tiny cot!' Not to mention an excuse to show Rachel Weisz' ass.This is two hours of my life that I want back.",1,45,80,16 July 2006
