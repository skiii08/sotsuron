The Lobster," Horrible, low vibrational movie with great acting
","Because I love Collin Farrell and I believe he is a great actor, I started to watch this movie. The storyline is absurd, but since I am a great Science Fiction lover (I am even a science fiction novelist), I don't get scared about a little bit of weirdness. But this movie is not only weird and absurd, it's jam packed with total unnecessary shock therapy. In my opinion that is. Reading the reviews there must be individuals loving this movie, but I can't imagine that. Other than the great acting and cinematography. I would not want to meet the writer. He must be seriously deranged. The movie does not deserve 2 stars I gave because of the great acting and directing. But... Since I really want to warn you as a potential viewer that this movie will drag itself half dead for two hours passed your valuable life and you will get nothing more from it than a bad taste in your mouth... please, spare yourself the horror. There is nothing in this movie that justifies you wasting those hours of your life.",2,39,67,24 December 2015
Hereditary," 2 Stars for the acting and the promising first hour
","But for the rest of it, I want my time back. I have seen a brilliant first half completely derail in utter nonsensical hogwash.",2,0,2,30 January 2019
