Requiem for a Dream," Rape of the viewer
","If  my mind was ever raped... This movie will touch you where youdon´t want to be touched. Heroin addiction was never shown soprettily and nasty in one shot.The acting is almost too real.Don´t miss this one, it´s a film that will become a classic. Sadlyand painfully.",8,1,2,20 November 2003
The Machinist," Dark, stressful and clever
","I checked out this movie today and yesterday; I felt I wanted to see it again, knowing what the writer knew from the beginning. After the first viewing I was a bit worried about the script's logic, but I was a bit more content after the second one.This film had me worried about Christian Bale's health. Starving yourself this bad for a character is borderline uncool - even though it made the story more believable. All that press about Bridget Jones and putting on weight - what about looking like a walking corpse?The story is well written and the set is almost black and white in its bleakness - it has a sickly green/gray/yellow tint. The feel is paranoid from the get go, and then it gets more and more twisted.This is good weird - and Christian Bale is fantastic!",9,1,1,26 October 2005
Goon," Puck in Goal!
","Definitely not a hockey fan, though I am from Sweden - but I so enjoyed this movie. Funny, stupid, smart at times, and pretty gritty. I always thought that Jay Baruchel had something special, and he delivers. This script is very well written. Seann William Scott is perfect in his role, as are many others - I wish we had seen more of the Russian brothers;)Amidst all the violence and stupidity, there were a few thought provoking lines, this was my fave: 'Everybody loves the soldiers, until they come back and stop fighting.'I would also like to mention some of the sequences when Laflamme is on the ice, it just looks awesome! I loved it! And I may become a hockey fan;)",8,1,1,10 June 2012
Into the Wild," Mind gone wild
","This starts out like a fairly ordinary young man breaking free from the norm, finding his inner self. But a lot more is added. Alex/Chris has issues with his parents, well dad mainly, and goes off on an adventure, where the goal is living off the wild in Alaska.On the journey he meets people that really care for him, but he must keep moving. His choices seem to make sense at first, but gradually you wonder about his self preservation.At the end I pondered what his own take on the story would be, and if he actually managed to grow up, he was still so young. Some say the brain is not fully developed until age 25.As a film I totally recommend: direction, acting and pretty much everything is first class.",9,0,1,25 July 2008
