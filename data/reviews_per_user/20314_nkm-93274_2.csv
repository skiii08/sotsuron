Captain Phillips," How did Hanks not get an Oscar nom?
","Tom Hanks delivers another breathtaking performance, alongside with Barkhad Abdi. Powerful acting, story, music, you name it. It is a heart-pounding thriller that needs to be seen. Once the Oscar nominations came out, Hanks was not on the list. WHAT A SHOCKER!! An overall wonderful film about the true events of Captain Phillips and the four Somali pirates with superb acting and edge of your seat thrill.",9,1,2,4 May 2018
A Quiet Place," One of the BEST Survival Thrillers Ever!!!
","What an amazing cinematic experience!!! I expected a great thriller and I got a great thriller. It has everything. The jump scares, the intense music, the plot twists. A great representation of survival and sacrifice. How far would you go to protect your children? Superb acting as well, even though there was very little dialogue. I enjoyed every single scene! Very excited for the sequel!",10,3,6,4 May 2018
