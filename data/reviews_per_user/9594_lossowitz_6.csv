Changeling," a true story is not a story
","Life can be an inspiration for fiction but the artist who uses it must adapt it to tell a story of importance. There must be a beginning, an end and there must be a reason to tell.In this, almost I would say worst movie ever, there is none. Yes, there is a beginning and an end, but they do not seem related and everything that happens in between happens for almost no reason at all. Just like in life, one could say, but that was clearly not the message of the makers.No, they had to tell about... a woman losing a child and getting another one back. OK, might be interesting. But not if the woman's only reaction is to scream: 'I want my son! This is not my son!' (And that about twenty-four times.) Then it's improvisation by amateur theater players. Not if the bad men are just bad men, no dimension, no nuance, just cruel and evil.The script goes nowhere, does not know what to tell, and the heroine, the unbelievable bad acting Jolie, does not once take action. She is constantly invited by others to do anything.The change from a 'give me back my son'-theme to a 'evil guy abducts little boys and slaughters them for his pleasure'-theme is made with no preparation, and the themes have nothing to do with each other. So, at once there are two stories to tell. Follows the 'psychiatry in the 20's was a fraud'-theme, with bad bad doctor man and evil sister woman. And, oh yes, the good hooker for good measure.The last half hour adds nothing. Why do we get 10 minutes of hanging the crazy boy killer? The last scenes are good, but just because of the little boy and his mother, two sincerely played roles. The onlooking Jolie does what she does the whole film: get out the emotion and then repress it. A weak technique by a weak actress. (Oh, and of course, the hand to the mouth, another brilliant technique.) Malkovich is talking so unclear that you wonder if that was his revenge to be cast in this one penny melodrama.Accompanied by music seeming to be made for a burial services commercial, this is an example of how a true story is not a story. Not if you don't have any clue what to tell and just tell everything: and then you get, instead of a possible sandcastle, a pile of mud.",1,25,51,1 April 2009
Marie Antoinette," A new candlelight
","A historic movie can be made with four intentions: to tell an exciting story, to teach history, to analyze the present by referring to the past or to shed a new light on history as it is told: deconstructing myths.After watching Marie Antoinette is tend to believe that Sofia Coppola's intention was the latter, with the third intention as a side effect.The movie clearly enters the discussion about the historic Marie Antoinette, who is, especially in France, seen as a reckless and spoilt half-spy, interfering with politics and who was executed rightfully after the French revolution. That last event is not even shown, but the director expects the viewer to know the end, as it is with more 'things one knows about Marie Antoinette'. It is even made explicit when the role itself refers to her most famous remark: 'Let them eat cake!' 'I never said that!' states Kirsten Dunst.But what exactly is this new light that Coppola wishes to shine on the subject? It never becomes clear, maybe because the script is torn between staying true to history and showing a woman's coming of age.It could have been a girl thrown into the cruel protocol of a highly organized court. But Marie Antoinette, though subjected to awful habits, never really suffers. The problem with getting pregnant from a almost impotent king troubles her and her mother, but before it becomes a life-threatening burden, history breaks in and a child is born.To be laughed at by the rest of the court is never sketched as intolerable or the reason for her to take flight into sugar rushes, a make believe rural village or into the arms of a passing Swedish officer. She just does as all the others do at this court of leisure and endless parties.By use of music Coppola tries to link that lifestyle to the lifestyles of the party people of today: the young and rich attending to their hairstyles, clothes, where to be with whom without one thought for the real problems of the world.But even that analogy is never stretched to its limits: Marie Antoinette takes an interest in arts, reads Rousseau and genuinely enjoys the eggs and the milk in her life like farm resort.So what do we end up with? A movie that never seems to know what it wants to tell: it is not history, it is only chunks of it. It's not a parallel with the present. It is not a real light on Marie Anoinette, maybe just a candlelight. And what the greatest miss is: it's not an exciting story.Kirsten Dunst can be adorable. Some scenes are clearly charmingly improvised. And Jason Schwartzman is as dorky as Jamie Dornan is hunky. But if that is all, it is not enough.",5,5,6,12 July 2009
Silver Linings Playbook," Without a strategy you get nowhere
","'You need a strategy!' is the advice that Pat's therapist gives him to master his bipolar disorder and the violent outbursts that come with it. This is good advice, and something that the writer/director should have taken himself, as it seems to be the thing this movie lacks.First, this is not a comedy. There are no jokes,no humorous situations, and the witty quips are seldom spot on. The movie unfolds as a dramatic story of a psychiatric patient's reintegration in society after his treatment. A valuable cause that is played out pleasurably understated, and confronts the audience with the tension between theory and practice, and how families and patients cope. It helps that Pat is played by the hunky Bradley Cooper who oozes good will, for some decisions Pat makes border on dangerous ground.Enter Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany, a fellow patient, struggling with the loss of her husband; okay, two people in their craziness against the world, that is a theme. But just as the movie lingers on, seemingly about the daily life of these people and their families, we are confronted with some sidelines, and without a warning we are just a few plot twists away from a dance therapy center for troubled youth, and could the movie be renamed Step Up 5 or Dirty Dancing 3.Then we get the relapse (on a very sunny and warm day for December), and a crazy bet that is such an obvious plot device to 'wrap it all up' that the rest of the movie is as predictable as it gets, abandoning the theme, changing from perspective (to Tiffany's) and all secondary characters join in the victory and the get together of the two leads, when suddenly it is suggested that Tiffany wasn't crazy at all and just played crazy to gain Pat's trust to get closer to him. Oh what? It unnerves me that Jennifer Lawrence has received an Academy Award for this role of a crazy, non-crazy, lying, non-lying woman, so very unsympathetic and so badly written. Robert de Niro displays all the laziness he gets away with, culminating in an atrociously acted angry scene, exemplary for first year drama students. Cooper forgets in the last quarter of the film that he is a psychiatric patient, becoming the sensible, down to earth, perfect specimen of a man as by magic.Not a comedy, not a drama and certainly not a dance movie (with such an important dancing scene one would hope they hired actors who could actually dance a little bit and not strut around like vegetables on sleeping meds). A very mediocre effort on all accounts.",5,6,12,24 March 2013
Music and Lyrics," Creativity and popularity
","'No pets or children' sounds a guideline for filmmakers, and for screenwriters it should be: 'no creative problems or stage careers as a theme'. Only a biopic can portray stage scenes and popularity on a level that is believable, just because that is what the audience knows about the subject: yes, this star was popular.The theme of this movie is arguably a love story, but with the title Music and Lyrics, the creative process of writing is at the center of the tale. From the start the love affair of the ex-POP! singer Hugh Grant and the wannabe writer Drew Barrymore follows the road of the romantic comedy, albeit that they need to 'write the music and lyrics of their love themselves'. There we have the first problem: any depiction of a creative process becomes tiresome, regardless of the many dead pan jokes Hugh Grant gets to make. Watching people try to rhyme or look for a song idea is watching... people try to rhyme or look for a song idea. It is like watching people work.Then we have the performances of the movies superstar Cora, which should be valued somewhere between Britney and Christina: but how on earth do you simulate a big, expensive, explosive pop concert without doing exactly that: staging a big, expensive, explosive concert? Well, you do it slightly cheaper, smaller and, not so explosive. And it shows. Yes, there is a large Buddha from where Cora emerges, but would Britney or Christina put up a whole show with just one large Buddha on stage? Ten different Buddhas maybe, and a pyramid, and a temple and a burning sky scraper. The audience knows what a superstar concert looks like, and is not easily convinced. The actors give it their best shot, and some even succeed, but all in all this is a perfect example for how a screenwriter best avoids depicting fictional popular concerts, and showing the process of creativity. They're implausible and tiresome, and both traits are ill- fated for a commercial movie, which a rom-com, with all its rules and clichÃ©s, is.",5,0,1,25 August 2012
The Proposal," Bullock is no Streep
","An ambitious young person has to deal with an arrogant, strict, unhappy, over-ambitious and mean boss and deal with her every whim. Sound familiar? The Proposal is in a way a copy of The Devil Wears Prada, be it that instead of a mother-daughter relationship, this one has romantic possibilities. Sandra Bullock, however is no Streep, and that's what makes this movie so much less entertaining to watch. To play mean is not to be mean, and instead of deploying all the wonderful techniques that the lady with the three academy awards has to her disposal, Bullock just is a bitchy whiner. She never really is scary or powerful. She seems reluctant to be perceived as mean by the audience, and that takes any venom out of her remarks or actions.Ryan Reynolds does not make up for that lack of credibility by never being really terrified. Bullock's character just tires him. The plot has enough twists and lines to make the movie take flight, but it doesn't happen. The grandma could be the one that makes us laugh, but Betty White is no Streep either and just plays the clown, which is almost never funny. If you create a scene where an old lady thanks the Godmother in the woods dressed in a rug, the actress needs to take that ritual as serious as possible. Not act as if she is dressing up for a family play.Comedy is the hardest form of acting, and this movie is proof of that.",4,6,8,19 March 2012
V for Vendetta," V for Very bad
","I saw this movie without any pre-knowledge what it was about. The title made me assume it was about criminals and some long lasting vendetta.Not a fan of gangster movies I was pleasantly surprised that it was about a imaginary near future where someone was taking on 'the mean and ruthless government': hey, next to some inventive plotting there might even be some profound political comment about media influence and the power of images.Sadly, the movie did not take one wrong turn, but made it a sport to take as many as possible. The script left the road that was laid out, and instead of making beautiful twists, it just... went nowhere. We have this man that obviously is the only man in this new England where all disturbing elements (foreigners, gays, Muslims) have been put in to boats to either Europe or America, that dares to challenge the powers that be. That's fine, we understand why: the people that control the streets are rapists, that's what is told us in the very first scene.But after that, we are told that the real reason is that he was subject to some secret government tests for a viral weapon. Why is that reason added? Why do we have to unravel some plot of years ago, with a female Mengele apologizing on her death bed? Why do we have to be told some tear jerking lesbian love story halfway? Those added story lines have no use, slow the movie down and rub up some of the worst melodrama: Evey kissing the toilet paper where the killed lesbian has written 'I love you stranger'.Then there are the clear plot mistakes: the late night presenter making fun of the dictator in such a way that he cannot seriously believe he will just pay a fine and do some charity fund raiser! V taking risks to kill all that tortured him: he wants to throw over the government, then they will be punished automatically, so what's the use? Evey, who is hunted down by a totalitarian regime, who leaves V's house to go... where? And her hair not growing an inch during all the weeks after her fake imprisonment! The cliché of them falling in love is so badly constructed that it hurts to the eyes. The inspector having some strange experience where he 'sees all', even the flashbacks of the lesbian victims. Is he psychic? It all adds to the feeling of looking at something that was rewritten twenty three times and no one made sure that the movie was about one thing and one thing only: instead it is about a lot of things that all tumble another way.The ending is especially awful, with some useless killing and a blowing up of parliament when the victory is already safe. Evey saying that V was 'everyone' is gratuitous and nothing more than beautified writing: it gave me stomach pains.It was then that I saw that it was Nathalie Portman I watched: okay, one actress more NOT to watch again.All in all it left me with the question: why was this movie ever made? Then I went here, and it had a 8.2. And that was the reason I left a comment, for the very first time. This movie is not worth an 8.2. Not even half that.",3,11,25,5 March 2009
