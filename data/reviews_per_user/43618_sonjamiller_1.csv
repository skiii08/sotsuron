The Hangover," This movie gave ME a hangover
","First off, we were a bit reluctant to see this movie after reading its plot summary but the rating (8.4 at the time) and all the positive user comments made us give this movie a chance.Needless to say, we regret doing so.Perhaps it is a mistake. Perhaps this movie should have been given 4.8 instead of 8.4 and even this would be too generous, in my opinion. The movie is not only a clich√© of Hollywood bachelor's night 'what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas' type of films, but 99.9% of the jokes were either tasteless or completely predictable. The actors did not even do a remotely good job and the screenplay writers did absolutely nothing to help them along the way.I still want someone to explain to me what was so different about this movie..",3,15,32,20 June 2009
