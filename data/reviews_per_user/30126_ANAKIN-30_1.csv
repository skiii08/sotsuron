Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The saga begins...
","Don't give in to the hype- just sit back as the the 'Greatest Space Fantasy of All' begins. While it's not perfect- there's really no way it could be. It is very good, and for me, gets better with each viewing. The cast is great, with Neeson, Portman and McDiarmid outstanding in their roles. Jake Lloyd was fine, but McGregor will have to wait for the next chapter to let loose on Obi-Wan. Jar Jar Binks was fine, but the greatest CG character was, by far, Watto- he almost stole every scene he was in. The battle scenes could have been a little more exciting- there was almost too much going on to focus on the conflict. All in all, pretty damn good- and we still have the best yet to come.",9,0,0,26 May 1999
