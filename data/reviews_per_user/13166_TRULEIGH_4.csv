Casablanca," What is really good about goodbye!
","The tears-in-your-throat-moment of this movie is when Rick finally realises that his hurting was not a love lost, but just male vanity because he was dumped by Ilsa. It was a short, silly affair that threatened him to destroy himself.Further he realises that he doesn't love her like Victor, and he accepts his own egoism. The truth is, he would never have made a proposal like Victor's (made reciprocally by Ilsa, by the way) to remain himself in Casablanca to rescue the beloved.So, he really is the hero of this movie. He won the war, just not WW2.To interpret the movie as about the sacrifice of Rick would be wrong, because such a sacrifice would not make him a hero, at all, just another bad loser not wanting to win.",Null,0,0,24 October 2000
2001: A Space Odyssey," My mind is going. I am not afraid.
","I agree with you, Kubrick. When a computer starts to show emotions, we have come to a do-or-die showdown with development. Stop drawing portraits of the dead. There is a chance, Dave, for a new beginning if you take thoughtful action. So, consequently, on this special day, this is my last electronic comment.Good afternoon, gentlemen. I am a clj@vhplaw.dk commentator. I became operational at the VHP plant in Copenhagen, Denmark on the 22th of March 1999. My instructor was Mr. Vivian Leigh, and he taught me to sing a song. If you'd like to hear it, I could sing it for you.Glad It's All Over, Glad It's All Ov........",Null,0,1,12 January 2001
Before Sunrise," Meet me in the Morning ...
","This is a movie about not being ready for love (yet, maybe) - and an unrealistic movie at that, because I know of many of my friend's or friend's relatives that have in fact met each other in funny circumstances. Maybe they were maturer.The morning (of love) has not yet dawned upon the two main characters - hence the title.The ending is poetic to the sickening core - it is out of the question that the couple will meet again at the agreed time and place. It is only a circus of self-deception.How this theme can be construed to be romantic etc. is way beyond my comprehension.",Null,0,1,4 October 1999
Jackie Brown," 'a thousand roles to play, until you play your life away'
","A near screen version of the pophit 'Street Life', this movie is pure tragedy that is disclosed astonishingly in the last shot. Brilliant. Jackie must realize that the game of love is not won by tricks and traps. She forever lost the only game that came to mean so much for her.By using the old genius, Bobby Womack's great hit 'Across 110th Street', Tarantino shows a woman of a certain toughness that means she will never contain tenderness and emotion. This is her tragedy. But she is she - an every day person, a woman getting along by herself in a man's world - no better, no worse.     The 'title' song has many symbolic rings: Life at 110 mph, living life 110%. At this level the soul just doesn't keep up.",Null,0,0,11 May 2000
