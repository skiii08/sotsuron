Skyfall," too long and with a weak plot
","The Mrs and I went off to this, and we couldn't wait for the film to be over. I did ask whether she wanted to leave early but she said 'no'. After Casino Royale, which I did enjoy, this was a huge disappointment, and am a little surprised that it received such high reviews.The plot was pretty weak and the film dragged on and on and on, probably being 30 minutes too long. The filming is it's usual high quality, but still overall both my wife and I found this boring, something you can't usually level against a Bond film.The one good part of the film's plot was at the end, where it attempts to tie in all the characters that are to be found in the 'later' films (chronologically speaking). Having said that, while I knew Casino Royale was supposed to be early Bond, and Quantum of Solace seemed to be a continuation due primarily (to me) to Giancarlo Giannini's role, I was not aware that Skyfall was a continuation. Half way through the film it goes on about Bond being old and ready for retirement, thus one might be lead to think that he was at the end of his career, but the end rather contradicts this.",5,14,30,13 December 2012
