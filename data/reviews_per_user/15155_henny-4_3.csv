The Blair Witch Project," Interesting, but not scary.
","An excellent example of how good a low-budget film can be, and that nobody needs to pay an actor $20 million to ensure big box-office.  An interesting way to make a film - taking your cast out into the woods and terrorising them, but it's a pity we didn't get to experience some of that as well.  I had heard so much about how frightening this film was, but found it about as scary as 'The Sound of Music'.  I'd be interested to see how the rumoured sequels turn out.",8,0,1,1 February 2000
Underworld," Vampires take over the world by boring everyone to death.
","I usually love vampire flicks but I couldn't wait for this one to end. There was not one original moment in the entire film, the setting (everything is black and it's constantly pouring rain) is obviously supposed to be suitably gothic but is actually laughably cliched, and the costumes and special effects are straight out of 'The Matrix'.  The gaps in the plot made the story very hard to follow in the early stages, but this may have been a decision made in the cutting room to keep the audience from realising that they'd seen it all before.  At times it was so bad that it was actually funny and at the screening I went to, the supposedly dramatic climax had the entire audience laughing.  Two hours of my life that I'll never get back.",1,12,27,1 February 2004
Mission: Impossible II," Very disappointing
","Apart from a few of John Woo's trademark beautifully constructed action sequences, this film has nothing to recommend it.  The plot is pedestrian and the writing is disappointing - quite a bit of time is spent explaining the blindingly obvious and supposed 'plot twists' are telegraphed to the audience so far in advance that you're bored before they happen.  Although the special effects are an improvement on the first movie, this is the first time I have been in danger of falling asleep during a John Woo film.  The representation of Australia is cringingly embarrassing - apparently we all speak with very broad accents, call everyone 'mate' and hang around sheep farms.  Some lovely shots of Sydney didn't quite make up for the stereotype. Enjoy the scenery because there's absolutely no suspense.",5,0,0,2 June 2000
