Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The best sci-fi comedy in years!
","The Phantom Menace is a sci-fi comedy spoof based on the Mel Brooks classic 'Spaceballs'. Many people (wrongly) thought that it was part of a prequel trilogy to the Star Wars movies, in which George Lucas had (allegedly) been involved in making many years ago, but anyone expecting a film like that would only be disappointed. The film isn't as serious as Spaceballs and it's also worth noting that the effects aren't as impressive, particularly the cartoon-style CGI, but this isn't a problem due to the comedic nature of the film; decent special effects would only have detracted from the gags and OTT acting. The movie pokes fun at the nonsensical storyline of Spaceballs by itself making very little sense at all, throwing in some humorous subplots about taxes and trade embargos for good measure.The film was so successful that George managed to once again line his pockets by licensing merchandise based on the film, which is pretty funny when you consider the scene in Spaceballs where they look at Yogurt's cave; this brilliant sense of irony is just one of the many things that proves George to be a very clever man indeed. He must've had a lot of fun making this film and it shows, as there's almost nothing here which you could take even remotely seriously. This is probably my favourite comedy movie from that year, although the sequels weren't quite as good (apart from the 'noooooo!' scene in the final film, which is possibly the funniest thing to feature in a film, EVER).Having read a lot of the reviews on IMDb, it disappoints me that so many people misunderstood what George was trying to achieve. Of course as a serious sci-fi movie this doesn't work, but the film was never supposed to have any artistic merit. So sit back and enjoy the brilliant film that George has made, and may the midi-chlorians be with you!",1,5,11,25 June 2012
The Fan," Not great, but worth watching for DeNiro alone...
","I watched this film again yesterday for what is probably the fourth or fifth time. Firstly, it's not a great film, so if you demand 9/10 from a movie then this isn't for you. Also, although baseball is a very interesting sport to some, the great majority (particularly outside the US) just don't get it and are not interested in the sport. This undoubtedly will have an affect on some viewers' enjoyment of the film, although you could apply the psychology of it to any sport; it's just that a lot of people would need it to be based on a sport that they enjoy. Fair enough...Bad bits: The part that Ellen Barkin plays is totally pointless and the film would be better without her. There are a few characters that are slightly annoying because they're playing into steretypes. The way the lead characters drive around in huge SUV's seems to be spot-on though and quite believable, although you have to question just how much Robert DeNiro's character is earning and why he lives in such a dump whilst owning such an expensive vehicle (although it does happen I know). There are a few bits that are difficult to believe, like the ending (it just seems to go a bit too far). But then to me, that's kind of the whole point of this film...Good bits: It's fun! The ridiculous poem at the beginning sets the scene brilliantly - this is about someone who really cares about something. That doesn't make them an intelligent person, he isn't meant to be; hence the poem is a bad one.Not every film needs to be ultra realistic. Like for example, why does the boss have a car door sat by the desk? Nobody would ever hold a sales meeting like that! My boss has never so much as spilt his tea or dropped a biscuit in such meetings. If you want this scene in ultra realistic format, watch Alec Baldwin in Glengarry Glenross.Why don't the police catch De Niro sooner? I don't want to go into details but at the end of the film, you can't help but think that real police procedure might be different (although not being a cop, I couldn't say that with authority). But who cares?! DeNiro is fantastic, fans like him DO exist and this sort of event has taken place before. Plus the music is brilliant, it has some great lines, they don't waste time with a pointless love interest and the film is short and to the point...If you can accept films with a pinch of salt then you will enjoy this movie. The rating doesn't do it justice and I've seen so many films that are much worse with higher ratings. People who rate it 1/10 just because they don't like baseball should be stopped from reviewing. I don't like baseball, but I love movies!",7,2,3,6 September 2006
Split," Too long and a suffers from a real lack of tension
","I'm going to start this review by stating that this isn't a particularly original film - there are already quite a few out there which do the same thing, only far better. Only last week I watched 10 Cloverfield Lane, which is broadly similar, yet a far superior movie. The reason 10 Cloverfield works (the final 10-15 minutes aside) is that you always feel John Goodman's character could lose it at any moment. And from time-to-time, he does. That movie really had me on edge and the tension was almost unbearable at times. Unfortunately, 'Split' did not do this well. The runtime and pacing is probably one of the biggest issues, because a movie like this set over 117 minutes really needs to be handled by a master. I don't know much about this director, but he's no Kubrick. And although Kubrick could be self-indulgent (Eyes Wide Shut was a catastrophe), a film like The Shining runs for well over 2 hours, but the suspense and atmosphere carries it all the way. With Split, the film lulls and drags you really don't believe you're going to see this 'beast' they talk about till the very end, which is a big problem, because you're not on the edge of your seat. Perhaps sharper editing would help and personally I would've cut it down substantially, but that still wouldn't have made it a great movie.McAvoy gives a decent performance, but I'm not about to overstate it. I saw a film called 'The Love Butcher' the other day and the almost unknown actor in that film also played many characters quite successfully. Lots of actors are capable of this and I'm sure many will cite McAvoy's performance as being a key element of the film, but for me it doesn't save the movie. If you want campy fun of this sort, check out John Lithgow in Brian De Palma's Raising Cain! Other acting in the film is absolutely fine, although you don't get to see two of the girls all that much. This again is another problem, because this sort of film really works best when you can put yourself in the place of the victim(s). It doesn't really dare you to do that, as it moves from place to place, but doesn't focus on their plight.There's a huge plot hole something which one of the characters should have said near the end of the movie, but I won't elaborate, as I don't want to spoilt it. It's a glaring plot hole though! To conclude, it really does drag so much and I couldn't wait for it to end. It gets to the point where you know everything there is to know, but it won't stop. We're just treated to more 'performance' from McAvoy, but by this point, you won't care. I could recommend at least a dozen similar films without a second thought which are far better than this, so I honestly wouldn't waste your time. There were a few laughs along the way, but by the end of the film, you certainly won't be laughing. Overall, for me it's a 4/10.",4,46,108,16 January 2017
Garden State," Completely pointless
","It's very rare that I come away from a film feeling that it had absolutely no redeeming features. I can however say with all certainty that this is definitely one of them. It's got a horrible 'trendy' soundtrack, rubbish characters (Portman is irritating beyond belief) and I just can't understand why it even exists. I don't mind a love story; I like subtle ones as well as the cheesy stuff, but this is just useless. I'm sure some readers of the Guardian (lefty UK newspaper) will enjoy it, but that's by no means a recommendation...It started off a bit 'Grosse Point Blank' like (although that is clearly a great movie), then it descended into a poor man's 'Lost in Translation'. Two people connecting... that's about all I got from this movie. The jokes aren't funny, in fact I did wonder at one point if I was even supposed to laugh! I feel sad that I wasted my time watching it and I sincerely hope that you don't make the same mistake. Why it has such a high rating on here, I'll never know, but at least it means I might get some money back selling it on eBay!",1,22,45,21 September 2006
Saw," Good, not brilliant
","Keeping it short, I have to say that there are many good things about this film. The storyline, the plot twists, the scares - all spot-on. If you like horror films and thrillers, you'll really like this regardless of what I'm about to add... there are just two things that let the film down:1) Cary Elwes - Despite seeing him in a number of films, I still don't know how to pronounce his surname. Generally he's good in most films, (especially Glory), but in this his limitations really are shown. At the end of the film I was laughing because he had such trouble acting scared, which really detracted from the film. The fake stuttering is the worst part. It's not his fault, not everyone can act scared, but if you can't do it then you shouldn't appear in this kind of movie.2) Cary Elwes' makeup - Maybe they wanted him to look like a distinguished doctor, who knows? To me he looks like someone threw a bag of flour over him. Rather than treating patients, it's easy to think that he actually spends most of his time baking cakes...So overall, a very good film, but sadly let down by some minor (but in my opinion important) issues.",7,0,1,29 August 2006
