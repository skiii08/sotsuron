Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Hilarious..but the show is still better.
","I'll get this out of the way first. I loved this movie, it was hilarious and I laughed harder than I had for a long time at the theatre. The only thing that bothered me is valuable screen time was wasted with the scripted material. I didn't want this movie to end, and knowing how long the movie was, every time more scripted content came on I was wishing 'hurry up and get back to the good stuff' I cant wait until the DVD is released and we get to see all the cut material. If you've never seen the show, you'll love the movie (as long as you like this type of humour...and 'get' the joke that he's making fun of you and not Jews or Kazakh or anyone else) If you've watched the show, you'll still love the movie, but be slightly let down (a whole sequence in the movie is almost identical to one of his topics from da ali g show....still funny, but wish there could have been something new instead.4.5 out of 5, will buy the DVD for sure...but hopefully the coming onslaught of Borat quoting and imitations from all corners of society...friends, coworkers, every teenager in the country...wont sour me on the great Borat.",9,1,6,5 November 2006
