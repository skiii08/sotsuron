Raiders of the Lost Ark," In love with Indy for 22 years....
","Quite simply one of the greatest movies of all time.  I have seen it so many times, I've lost count--and I still want to watch it some more.  My question is this:  does anyone know when it will be available on DVD?  How is it possible that it isn't out yet but The Legend of Boggy Creek is???",10,0,0,27 February 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," What am I missing here?
","I'm really in the minority on this one but I did not especially care for this film.  The good points:  it was visually beautiful and peopled with stunningly attractive actors wearing lovely costumes.  The score was compelling.  I didn't mind the subtitles at all; reading the words as I hear them in another language, rather than being a hindrance, adds another level of depth for me.  But....The plot sequence sometimes seemed confusing and choppy.  I often wondered where the action was taking place (except during the delightful desert scenes, which were my favourite in the movie.)  I thought the fight scenes were too long, hyperactive-looking (even frenetically robotic when compared with the graceful leaps across the rooftops), and not especially amazing. I love fantasy but didn't find much (beyond the deviance of gravity) that seemed fantastical.  I liked looking at the characters and their expressive faces, but couldn't empathise with them; character development seemed quite minimal to me.  I'm finding it hard to see beneath the story's surface and discover layers of symbolism and meaning there.I don't watch martial arts films per se and don't know much about the various philosophies of such.  Does this position hurt or help me in understanding this film?  I don't know.  I suppose it hurts but the vast majority of the American public doesn't know much about Wu Xia, I suspect, and they love the film!  I wanted to like it.  Typically, I find foreign films fascinating and revel in seeing gripping stories of people from other cultures.  (I loved Raise The Red Lantern, which I kept thinking of during the viewing of this film.)The bottom line is this:  I am a crouching pariah among rabid dragons!  I just feel blank regarding what is so incredibly wonderful about this film.",7,0,0,21 January 2001
Mulholland Drive," It's swell
","Ebert says about Mulholland Drive: 'One of the scenes also contains the funniest example of pure logic in the history of sex scenes.'  Can someone tell me what he's referring to?  I can't think of what it could be.  Thanks in advance.  (PS--I liked this movie very much.  My poor, struggling left brain is trying to piece every little bit together but my grooving right brain loves it as it is.)",Null,0,0,29 April 2002
Mystic River," If you're going to see this movie, don't pay full price...
","...see a matinee.  This film wasn't boring but wasn't very interesting either.  As someone else said, I kept waiting for something intriguing to happen, to give real meaning to the film and pull the disparate threads together.  It didn't.The film is:  too long, disjointed, emotionally flat where it shouldn't be, plot-challenged and overacted.  (Sean Penn chewed the scenery in places.) The only plus for me was that I liked the performances given by Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne (actors I haven't especially liked much in the past).Oscar-worthy?  No, not in my opinion.  An acceptable matinee or rental? Maybe.",4,0,0,5 November 2003
The Shawshank Redemption," Beyond Oscar-worthy
",I can't add very much to the previous descriptions and praise of this movie; I just want to say that it deserves its #1 standing at IMDb and I hope it holds that place forever.  A brilliant film that speaks to the humanity in all of us.,10,0,0,29 July 1999
Signs," More Nitpicking?
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS HEREIN:  I was disappointed with Signs.  I don't mind slow, quiet films but this was too slow for me.  I thought Mel Gibson was sort of one-dimensional and a bit rigid.  The other actors were good, however, and the film did have a couple of really intense moments, without stooping to chaotic, overblown special effects.Most of all, the religious aspect of it bothered me, especially coming from the seemingly multicultural Shyamalan.  I would think that actually being confronted with beings from another world would make one seriously question organized religion and the traditional creation and morality stories we've been told all our lives.  I wonder....does Christianity (or any mainstream religion) mention alien life forms (and what to do about them)?  It seemed to me that Mel Gibson's character retreated to religion in a knee-jerk, frightened way; it became his sanctuary away from science and reality and thought.  That probably happens all the time in real life but wouldn't the film have been less prosaic with a broader view of humankind's place in the universe?  Maybe not.I wanted to know more about why the creatures were there and what else was happening in the rest of the world.  I wanted to know why the aliens didn't have weapons.  How could they be so advanced in space travel but need mapping signs (crop circles) and not have a clue about the water situation--couldn't they have worn protective gear?  I just don't buy the whole scenario and think that M. Night, while directing some really scary moments, ultimately had a weak, frustrating story.  I could be wrong, though.",6,0,1,8 August 2002
