Hereditary," Needlessly slow - it's just a stupid horror movie
","The film is well shot. The climax is well made and unnerving. However, the movie wastes your time with the beginning half in which nothing happens. This criticism is unfortunately often misused in films where little action takes place to establish and deepen themes, or analyze characters. However, this movie is not intelligent or creative enough to make use of these periods of slow pacing. It does not contribute to any themes, it does not develop characters - the movie really just starts and ends with the concept of 'don't stick your in crazy'. Being slow paced and lacking jump scares is not substance in itself.Comparing this movie to other slower A24 titles like 'It Comes At Night', or 'The Witch' is incredibly misleading because while those movies were also slow paced, they used that downtime to flesh out themes, to build the tension, and to analyze characters and their motivations. 'Hereditary' does none of these things - it just wastes your time in an incredibly stupid manner because I feel as if this movie assumes its viewers are stupid and can't tell the difference anyway. It is incredibly insulting to have someone compare stretches of stupid indulgent trash with more thought out works.However, I am rating this movie a 6/10 because the climax was well done and unnerving, it's just not particularly subtle or intelligent. The ending was obvious, I saw the twist coming from a mile away. In the end, it's just an okay horror movie brought down by immense pretention with lack of talent to back it up.",6,2,5,23 October 2019
Hereditary," a dumb and pretentious horror movie
","It's nothing more than a stupid/shallow horror movie. The climax is quite well made and unnerving, but there aren't really any deeper themes or character analysis going on here. It really is just a stupid horror movie, but an incredibly pretentious one - the first half having literally nothing going on but mundane setup is completely unjustified because literally NOTHING is happening. I usually dislike this criticism because in most contexts it is falsely used, as in most movies people use that critique for are actually developing themes or studying characters. However, here it is entirely pointless. No deeper meaning, the characters are all one dimensional - though the lead actress does a good job. This movie being compared to others like the witch or it comes at night is utterly laughable, because those movies - while also slow - actually developed themes and analyzed characters. The slower moments also contributed to the general atmosphere of unease. Here, it's just an absolute stupid waste of time. There's little separating this movie from more 'mainstream' ones like the conjuring besides the snobby 'oh, we are so artful that we are above jump scares. Also, long stretches of nothing happening!' Could not have missed the point more. In films like it comes at night, those stretches were used in a meaningful way. Here it is just stupid.Kind of predictable, saw the twist coming, kind of dumb and very pretentious because yes this is a shallow movie. There was absolutely no need for the stretches of nothing or to act as if this is some higher form of art. Had it not been for the good climax, I would definitely have rated lower.",6,1,5,23 October 2019
The Conjuring 2," Pretty much the same as the first
","The first conjuring was decent at best, and just more okay overall. This one's the exact same - going through the motions as if youre on an amusement ride on from one excitement to the next. There are several moments in this one that are flat out stupid and bad though to where I burst out laughing, it's much harder to take seriously and feels more like a so bad it's good type thing.",4,0,3,29 October 2019
Midsommar," Utter trash
","No story, no interesting themes, no interesting characters, somewhat nice visuals at times and the rest is just nothing. Despite its many problems, at least hereditary had a payoff at the end, here there is close to nothing redeemable about this garbage. Just like hereditary, what little foreshadowing and themes there are are so blatant, so obvious, so poorly thought out that it's insulting.Is it a good intriguing and bizarre cult movie? Not particularly. Is it outstanding with its visuals? No. It excels at nothing. What an utter waste of time. This director is shaping up to be one of the worst hacks of recent years. I feel dumber having wasted my time with this.",4,4,8,23 October 2019
