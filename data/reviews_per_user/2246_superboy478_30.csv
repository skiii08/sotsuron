The Blair Witch Project," A Genuine Horror Film
","The Blair Witch Project was a box office hit at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival and was hailed by critics and audiences alike. Eventhough it only grossed $12 million in production, it was one of the biggest box office hits of 1999.Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Micheal Williams are film students at Montgomary College in Maryland. They are given a project by their film professor to do a documentary about a legendary witch scandal that occured during the Colonial days. They travel to the small town of Burkitsville to interview the locals about what they know on the Blair Witch. After one day of filming, they decide to head up to Burkitsville's Black Forest where they choose to film at Coffin Rock and other locations. When they reach the forest, it starts out like a walk in the park when they stick to their path. But, as the story moves along, they go off their path which ends up getting them lost. As the nights go by, they hear noises that don't sound normal for camping, and when the sun rises, they discover new things outside their tent every morning when they wake up. Their trip turns into nothing but a pure nightmare in the Black Forest of Maryland. Their cameras never stop rolling.Produced and directed by Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick (Blair Witch 2), The Blair Witch Project is a very chilling and disturbing movie that will leave you breathless by the end. For sure though, it is a very good movie.Best Ages:    15 & Up!",10,2,3,17 April 2002

Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," George Lucas is Da Man!!!!!!!
","George Lucas did not direct a movie since 1977 when he directed Star Wars: Episode IV- A New Hope. So, I thought that this movie was a very good come back for him. I thought that the movie was going to suck, when actually it kicked major a$$ with the cast, the music by John Williams, the special effects, plus more.Two jedi knights named Obi-Won Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Qui-Gon (Liam Neeson) have crash landed on a strange planet. While on this planet with Queen Amadila (Natalie Portman), the two Jedi's meet little Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) and discover that he is for sure going to be a Jedi when he grows up. After watching him win a pod race competition, they decide to take him away from his home (with his permission first) and go train him to be a jedi knight. When they do, it is discovered that they have to do battle with a creature warrior known as the Phantom Menace. They figure that this battle will teach youn Anakin that skill of being a Jedi knight.Written, produced, and directed by George Lucas (Raiders of the Lost Ark), Episode I was one of the best films of the summer of 1999.",10,1,3,19 May 2002
Raiders of the Lost Ark," A Fun, Family Adventure
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is a fantastic classic movie! All of the credit for its success and fun goes to George Lucas (Star Wars) and Steven Spielberg (A.I. Artificial Intellegence). The cast is what kicked some ass. That included Harrison Ford, Karen Allen (Starman), Paul Freeman (Power Rangers:The Movie), John Rhys-Davies (The Lord of the Rings).If you look hard enough, you will find out that Raiders is really sort of a sequel. I say this because if you notice, The Temple of Doom took place in 1935, and Raiders took place in 1936. So the Temple of Doom is actually a prequel.There is so much to say, but I have so little room to explain. Basically, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is going after the Ark of the Covenet before the Nazis get to it. At the same time, he has competition, which is Belleq (Paul Freeman). A rich, sleazy archeologist who steals from Jones whenever he gets the chance. Jones' love interest is Marion (Karen Allen) who tags along with him.This is definitley a movie for all ages and I recommend it to every family who reads this review. Look for a cameo by Steven Spielberg at the docks near the end of the movie.",10,0,0,1 March 2002
Minority Report," Best Movie of the 2002 Summer!
","Last summer, I went to see Steven Spielberg's previous movie A.I. Artificial Intellegence and I thought that it was an excellent motion picture. But also, last summer I heard that Steven Spielberg was planning to direct a movie called Minority Report about a group of futuristic police officers who catch serial killers before the crimes are even commited. I absolutley couldn't wait to see how this movie would turn out. So now, one year later, I went to the opening night of it and I must say that this was one hell of a movie. It was so cool the way that the future technology was developed, the way the special effects were created, and the best of all: Steven Spielberg did such a brilliant job directing the film. Movies like Minority Report only come once a year which is not enough considering that this is the kind of movie that people want to see. Things to enjoy throughout the movie are: the score by John Williams, the beautiful cinematography, the awsome screenplay, and the screen presence of a lot of the actors including Tom Cruise, Colin Farrel, Jessica Capshaw, Max Von Sydow. Minority Report will be one of the best experiences of your life.Steven Spielberg, I heard, is working on another movie called Catch Me If You Can starring Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio which is slated to hit theatres over Christmas of this year. Hopefully I will get to see that along with the sequal to Lord of the Rings.",10,0,0,22 June 2002
Training Day," The Real World

His assignment one day is to start training detective Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) who is being transfered to a new field of police work. Throughout the day, Jake is learning about the horrors of the city, the rough neighborhoods, and most of all, he is learning about his new partner Alonzo.Jake and Alonzo encounter a lot of crimes, but Jake discovers that all of the crimes that are going on are linked to Alonzo. He discovers that Alonzo has a dozen kids all over the city, that he gets high with drugs, and that HE IS THE BAD GUY in all of this. Jake does everything he can to avoid Alonzos deals which is hard because once your involved with Alonzo, your life is officially hell and over.Denzel Washington (John Q, Remember the Titans), Ethan Hawke (Hamlet, Gattaca), Dr. Dre (The Wash), Snoop Dogg (The Wash), Macy Gray, Scott Glenn (Vertical Limit), Tom Berenger (Sliver, Major League) all pitch in together and make one hell of a movie.Directed by Antouine Fatinque (Bait), Training Day is a very powerful and disturbing thriller that it will chill you to death from beginning to the end.Oscar nominations for Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke. Both of them were awsome choices for the movie.",10,6,17,19 March 2002
Unbreakable," The Secret Can Not Be Broken
","Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense, Signs), and starring Bruce Willis (Bandits), Samuel L. Jackson (Changing Lanes), Unbreakable is one hell of a movie.After a grusome train derailing occurs, it's discovered that the only survivor is David Dunn (Bruce Willis) who is a security guard that has never been in pain once in his life. David meets a disabled man named Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson) who believes that comic book super heros walk the earth and that David might be one of them considering that he has never been sick or injured before.This movie was very disturbing and suspensful. But I loved it and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a fun and scary time in the movies.Coming Soon:             Signs",8,0,1,24 April 2002
Stripes," Funny as hell!
","Stripes is a raunchy, adult comedy from critically acclaimed producer/director Ivan Reitman (Evolution, Kindergarten Cop). And it stars Bill Murray (The Royal Tenenbaums), Harold Ramis (As Good as it Gets), John Candy (Uncle Buck), Warren Oates (True Grit).Low life cab driver John Winger (Bill Murray) loses a lot in 2 hours. That is his job, his apartment, his girlfriend, his car. So, he decides that he's had enough of his pathetic life in New York, so he decides to join the army. He also talks his friend Russel Ziskey (Harold Ramis) into joining with him.When they finally do join, they are both put into a platoon drilled by Sgt. Hulka (Warren Oates) who has his eye on John. They both go through weeks and weeks of hell by doing basic training and putting up with Sgt. Hulka. But, they full fill their goal by meeting Stella (P.J. Soles) and Louise (Sean Young), two beautiful MP's who have their eys on Russel and John.As the story moves on, they go to battle in Germany and end up in more hilarious confilcts.I must say, I think that Warren Oates was a perfect choice for Sgt. Hulka, and that he was so brilliant and funny with the character. I give him graditude. 1921-1982
This is not a movie for kids, but teens may enjoy it if they are looking for a hilarious comedy. STRIPES is 100% classic and comedy!",8,26,43,5 March 2002
Blade," A Genuine Comic Book Brought to Life!
","Wesley Snipes stars as Blade. A half human/vampire who is on a quest to get rid of all vampires on the face of the earth. He is accompanied everywhere by Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), a man who found Blade at age 13. Blade's arch ememy is the vampire lord Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) who is planning to kill Blade and bring the vampire god La Magra back to life. Blade's love interest is played by N'Bushe Wright who cares deeply about him.This movie is by far very awsome. Awsome special effects, excellent screenplay by David S.

But all of that changes when Kevin discovers that 2 burglars named Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern) are on a scheme to burglarize the neighborhood.

Insomnia," Don't Sleep! Enjoy!
","I remember last summer when I had a bad case of insomnia due to nothin but fun. But when I saw the movie (2002 version), I was not only reminded of what no sleep is like, but what fun it was watching Al Pacino and Robin Williams become enemies.Los Angeles detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and his partner are assigned to go to Alaska and uncover a mysterious murder of a 17 year old girl. When they arrive in Alaska, they are teamed up with beautiful police officer Ellie (Hilary Swank) and her squad. While trying to solve the case, Will begins to suffer from insomnia because of the summer non stop daylight. It even gets worse because while out hunting a suspect in the fog, Will accidently shoots his partner leaving him dead. Will recieves a call the next day from a mystery novelist (Robin Williams) who claims to be the murderer of the 17 year old girl and who saw Will murder his partner. It turns into nothing but a world of blackmail because the author threatens to turn Will in if there is no cooperation between the two.I honestly think that Christopher Nolan is going to be a success because of his first two movies. He did such a brilliant job, that he deserves the best director oscar next year. And, I vote Pacino for best actor.",10,0,0,27 May 2002
Blade II," Weak Sequel!
","Blade II is probably one of the most dumb sequels made. It didn't make too much sense, the plot was boring and overrated, and it was too short.Wesley Snipes returns as the half human/vampire Blade. This time, he is not fighting vampires. He is fighting creatures known as Reapers. That is basically it.
Ages: 17 & Up!Hopefully Blade III will be better. I can't wait!",8,0,1,31 March 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Welcome Back George!!!!!!!!!!!
","I think that George Lucas is back in the group after spending 2.5 years filming Star Wars: Episode II- Attack of the Clones. The movie was so good that I can't wait until 2005 when Episode III comes out. Last night, I was so excited to see all of the characters from Episode I come back to the big screen. That included: Anikan Skywalker, Obi-Wan-Kenobi, Queen Amadila, Mace Windu, Yoda, R2-D2, C3P0, Jar-Jar Binks.The former queen Amadila (Natalie Portman), now a senetor, has traveled to a distant planet for business. When she arrives, it is discovered that a mysterious bounty hunter is trying to have her killed. So, she hires Obi-Wan-Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and a grown up Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christiensen) to protect her considering they are both Jedi knights. When they both accept the job, Anakin is told to take her to Naboo where she will be safe from the bounty hunter. When Anakin takes her there, he sees true beauty in her and she just sees the same little boy that she saw ten years ago. Friendship doesn't work for Anakin, so he tells her that he loves her and cares for her. She feels the same way about him, except she can't live a lie as can Anakin. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan-Kenobi is assigned to go to a hidden planet and find this bounty hunter before he strikes again. But, what Obi-Wan finds out, is that this planet is full of army's of heavily guarded Clones that are planning to attack Amadila and her people soon!! Obi-Wan ends up meeting their leader, which turns very bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I personaly give thanks to George Lucas (The Indiana Jones Trilogy) for bringing a kids book to life and creating such beautiful settings, and very cool special effects. Also, John Williams' compositions were very exquisite and beautiful as well.Written, produced, and directed by George Lucas, Attack of the Clones will have you cheerin throughout and by the end, you will be applauding!",10,0,0,19 May 2002
The Godfather: Part II," The Sequel of the 20th Century
","From Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather Part II is the greatest sequel ever in movie history. This time, there are two parts of the story that are very easy to keep up with and that are both very entertaining.The first part of the story tells about how Vito Corleone came to the United States at a young age to escape the horrors of the Mafia in Italy during the early 1900's and how he became part of the Mafia himself. The second part of the story tells about how Michael has taken over Vito's crime business and is planning to move the whole family over to Las Vegas.Produced by Mario Puzo (Superman), and directed by Francis Ford Coppola (The Outsiders, Dracula). The Godfather Part II is a very intense drama but turned out to be the greatest sequel of all time.Cast includes:   Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Robert De Niro, John Cazele, Robert Duvall, Dominic Chianese, Talia Shire, and Bruno Kirby.",10,0,1,2 June 2002
Cast Away," I Loved this movie to death!
","Cast Away was the best movie of 2000 and deserved a lot more than what some people gave it. Tom Hanks went through so much trouble losing and gaining weight at times during the filming.Fed-Ex supervisor Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) has just returned from a business trip in Russia just so he can spend Christmas with his girlfriend Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt). After the celebration, Chuck finds out he has to go back to Russia to close a deal. When he agrees, he boards a plane not knowing that it ends up crashing at sea with him still inside. He hops in an emergency raft and awakes the next morning to find out that he is ona deserted island. He hopes every second that he will be rescued soon, well it turns out that he spends 4 years on the island all by himself. After 4 years of nothing but bordom, Chuck decides to leave the island and head out to sea hoping he will be found. Later, he is found by a supply ship and is taken back to America. What's weird is that when he returns, everything has changed and he feels even more isolated than when he was one island.Robert Zemeckis did such a brilliant job directing this movie and he should've gotten a best director Oscar for his work on the film. Cast Away was the best film I saw of the first year of the century.",9,0,0,6 June 2002
Spider-Man," Fantastic! Spectacular! FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","Spider-Man is absolutley one of the greatest comic book adaptations of all time. When I went to see it, I had this feeling that it was going to be campy and boring. I also thought that the movie would turn out like a parody of all super-heroes. Instead, I received 2 hours 25 minutes of nothing but solid fun from begining to end.A high school science nerd named Peter (Tobey Maguire) has discovered a new species of spider during a class field trip one day. In fact, he is fiercely bitten by the new form of spider. Meanwhile, a tycoon scientist named Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe) is working on a transportation system for the city and may fail with his company if the test results indeed do so. Peter ends up saving his longtime crush, the sexy Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), from falling down in the cafeteria. What he discovers is that he can shoot a web from his wrist and dodge punches and bullying by his classmates. Norman Osborne then performs a test which turns out wrong and deadly because he is accidently mutated into the Green Goblin, a creature that wants nothing but evil. Peter then discovers his own new ablities and turns himself into the famous Spider-Man, a crimefighter who stops the big busts and dealers of New York and now is assigned to destroy the Green Goblin before it is too late.Spider-Man, I would have to say, is the best comic book movie produced incredibley ever since 1977 when Alexander and Ilya Salkind produced Superman.Produced by Laura Ziskin and Ian Bryce, and directed by Sam Raimi (A Simple Plan, Army of Darkness), Spider-Man will blow you away completley. It will also out do Star Wars: Episode II The Phantom Menace this summer!Coming Soon: SPIDER-MAN 2",10,0,0,10 May 2002
Ghostbusters," One of the Top 10 Blockbusters of all Time!
","Ghostbusters may be the greatest comedy of all time because it had great acting, a great script, great special effects, and great directing.Starring: Bill Murray (Rushmore, Kingpin), Dan Aykroyd (The Blues Brothers), Harold Ramis (Stripes, As Good as it Gets), Ernie Hudson (Oz, The Substitute), Rick Moranis (Spaceballs, Big Bully), Sigourney Weaver (Alien 1-4), Annie Potts (Toy Story I & II).After spoting a ghost at the New York Public Library, Dr. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Dr. Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), Dr. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) who are college professors, return to the university to discover that they are being fired.

So, they immediatley begin their business by buying an abandoned fire department and making it their building. They hire Jannine Melnitz (Annie Potts) as their secretary. They're business becomes an immediate success and life goes wonderful for them.But, when a single woman named Dana Barret (Sigourney Weaver) sees an image of a demon from hell in her refrigerator, she immediatley goes to the Ghostbusters for help which leads to her becoming Venkman's love interest. In the mean time, the E.P.A. is threatening to have the business shut down due to unlicensed nuclear power use.Dana and her neighbor Louis Tully (Rick Moranis) become possessed by other demons and talk about the main god from hell coming to rule earth. This puts the Ghostbusters on their biggest assignment of all.I don't want to spoil the rest.Great special effects from Richard Edlund (Raiders of the Lost Ark, Star Wars) and a great screenplay by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis!Produced and directed by the criticaly acclaimed Ivan Reitman (Evolution, Twins, Junior, Dave, Meatballs, Stripes, Kindergarten Cop), and co-produced by Joe Medjuck (Road Trip, All of Ivan Reitman's movies).Ghostbusters is the greatest comedy of all time and is a fun movie for kids especially!I also recommend Ghostbusters II!!!!!!!",9,0,0,7 March 2002

Mulholland Drive," The Best Time of My Life!
","I was traveling through Boulder, Colorado and while I was there, I found out that the movie critic Roger Ebert was at the University of Colorado, so I went to see what he was there for. Apparently, he was hosting the movie Mulholland Drive. Monday, he showed the entire movie from begining to end. For the rest of the week (starting on Tuesday and ending on Friday), he let the audience and himself study (basically comment) each shot of the movie and try to puzzle everything together. It was the best time of my life because while I was there, I met Roger Ebert and got to talk to him. Plus, I thought that he chose the right movie to show us. I'd never seen Mulholland Drive and didn't know who was in it, what it was about, nothing. But, by the end, I thought it was a masterpiece.The movie starts out with a woman (Laura Harring) ending up in a brutal car accident that leaves her with amnesia. She sneaks to a house and meets a wanna be actress named Betty (Naomi Watts). Together, Betty and the woman try to figure out the identity of the woman. Along the way, Betty and the woman fall in love with eachother.I honestly say, that nothing can be spoiled or explained clearly about this movie. You have to see it yourself in order to figure it out. The DVD will list 10 clues by director David Lynch (Blue Velvet, Eraserhead) that will help you solve the movies story and background.The movie was very confusing, but at the same time, I was extremely impressed with it. It was very good and very entertaining. Its a movie that will mess with your mind, but by the end, you will be able to figure out what the hell was up as long as you pay attention.I wanna say, very special thanks to Roger Ebert for being a good host and listener as well as choosing a good movie to show us. Thank You Roger!",10,1,1,25 April 2002

Pulp Fiction," Enjoy and Don't Analyze!
","Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest movies of all of time. The beauty about it was that in order to appreciate and understand it, all you had to do is enjoy it and not have to worry about analyzing it piece by piece like MULHOLLAND DRIVE.It was just creative the way Quintin Tarantino mixed up the plot, the after math, and the character's lives all in one movie like the way he did.There are three seperate story's to the movie that were split up scene by scene in this movie. Trust me, it is not confusing following the movie. It is a piece of cake.The first story is about a pair of hitmen named Vincent Vega (John Travolta) who is a selfish lowlife who does nothing but put down people, and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) who is a religious person who doesn't believe in killing but will if he is forced to or if he is mad enough. These hitmen are assigned to pick up a brief case at an appartment for their crime boss Marseluss Wallace (Ving Rhames) which turns out to be a success. However, it turns very bad because they take a hostage with them which ends up to the hostage accidently having his head gruesomly blown to bits. Jules and Vincent are forced to go to a man's house and call mob leader The Wolf (Harvey Keitel) to take care of the situation. Their day turns into nothing but pure hell.The second story is where Vincent Vega is scheduled to take Marsellus' wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out on a date. To me, that part of the story was very interesting because there was so much action and chemistry between Mia and Vincent. It becomes heroic because after dinner, she O.D.'s and that forces Vincent to do something that is hardly seen in the movies.The third story is about a depressed boxer named Butch (Bruce Willis) who apparently made a deal with Marsellus to lose a match in an upcoming boxing event. When Butch apparently kills the other fighter in the match that he was supposed to lose in, Butch and his european girlfriend Fabienne are forced to run. The big part of this part was that Butch accidently forgot his father's gold watch (Christopher Walken makes a funny and explicit monologue at the opening of this part) and forced to go back to his apartment to get it. He does get it but accidently runs into Marsellus. He and Marsellus are caught trying to kill each other and are taken hostage by two homosexual rapists who have a pet known as the 'Gimp.'The best thing about Pulp Fiction was the art, and the writing. To me, the script was just like the bible. Quintin wrote these characters lines that were spoken beautifully and with no apparent mistake, plus the actors were chosen perfectly. I couldn't have asked to see better actors than the ones Quintin chose. I honestly can say that Pulp Fiction has every single thing that every movie should have. I give it: **** out of ****.",10,1,2,4 May 2002

Shrek," The Biggest Hit of 2001!
","To me, this film was very unusual and at the same time, very entertaining. From the opening titles to the end credits of the movie, I honestly could not stop laughing.Deep, Deep, in the forest, an ogre named Shrek (Mike Myers) lives in a cabin with no one to talk to. He is basically lonely. But, all of that changes when a loud-mouthed donkey (Eddie Murphy) shows up out of the blue, Shrek becomes annoyed that there is no peace and quiet around the forest like it use to be. It gets even louder when fairy tale characters show up and command Shrek and the donkey to go on a mission to save the beloved Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from an evil castle and return her to an evil king (John Lithgow). Along the way, Shrek and the donkey just get on eachothers nerves.I give 100% graditude towards Eddie Murphy who made me laugh harder than ever as he played the donkey.Mike Myers (Austin powers, Waynes World), Eddie Murphy (The Nutty Professor, Showtime,) Cameron Diaz (Vannila Sky, The Sweetest Thing), John Lithgow (Cliffhanger, Third Rock From the Sun) star in this unforgettable comedy that was one of the biggest box office hits of 2001!

Trainspotting," ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES OF ALL TIME!
","Trainspotting has got to be one of the best movies that I have ever seen. It had a tight story, cool characters, and awsome direction from Danny Boyle (28 Days Later, The Beach).It tells the story of a group of friends who are: Renton, Begbie, Tommy, Sick Boy, and Spud. All of these guys are trying to make it in the real world on their own. Except, they are homeless and decide to crash at whatever place they can find for the evening. Plus, they're heroin addicts. And as the story follows closer with the heroin addiction, we become focused on Renton who decides he's going to give up heroin for good. Except with the influence of his friends, he'll be back to addiction in minutes. Plus, all of the guys put their heads together for a big scam with Begbie in the lead.I must say that this movies bears a striking resemblance to A Clockwork Orange with the themes and characters, etc. But this movie is very electrifying, entertaining, and very very hilarious at moments. I give the movie a 200 on a scale of 1-10.",10,0,1,19 January 2004

So, Indy and his good friend Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliot) along with long time partner in business Salah (John Rhys-Davies) go to Germany, save Henry and race against the Nazis to get the Holy Grail.

"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," A Brilliant Piece of Work!
","Everett McGill (George Clooney), Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson), and Pete (John Tuturro) have just escaped from prison in 1930 Mississippi. They find out about a hidden treasure which puts them on a quest through the south to go and find it. They end up doing whatever it takes. That means, singing live bluegrass, hitchiking, jumping on and off trains, and meeting women with strange powers, encountering the Ku Klux Klan, plus more.This film is one of the funniest, most hilarious comedies I have seen in a very long time. Most kids my age (which is 15), probably don't appreciate this movie as much as I did. But, all is well. I thought that George Clooney gave the performance of a lifetime in 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' Same goes for John Tuturro and Tim Blake Nelson.George Clooney (Oceans Eleven, One Fine Day), John Tuturro (Barton Fink), Tim Blake Nelson, Holly Hunter (The Piano), John Goodman (Barton Fink), Charles Durning (The Muppet Movie).Written and directed by the Joel & Ethan Cohen (Fargo, The Man Who Wasn't There, Barton Fink).
