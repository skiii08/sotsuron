The New World," Beyond Words
","Wow, i really can't find the words to describe this movie except that i loved it. I love the way it went beyond saying things or expressing feelings mostly through speech, and instead - showing you the way a single look can deliver a message or can show one...or several emotions that a million words could never amount to or do justice for. I like how they said a lot with their eyes. And i don't know, when she spoke, you know it was meant wholeheartedly and with the purest of intentions. I loved the point of view narratives, they were just so poetic and i loved the way she understood marriage as simply when your heart belongs to someone and that, ultimately, is what binds you to that person. I also like how it shows how although a certain love for someone may never cease, it can evolve, just as a choice concerning that love can also evolve when you begin to understand yourself, your situation, and life - and that you can find happiness again, even though it may be different from the happiness before. Q'Orianka Kilcher delivered an amazing performance. Love, sweeping and epic. It took my breath away.",9,6,13,8 February 2006
