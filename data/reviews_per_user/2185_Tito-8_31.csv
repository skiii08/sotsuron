The Blair Witch Project," Starts well, but gets worse as it goes along
","Thanks largely to some terrific dialogue, I found myself enjoying the first half of this movie.  The conversations seemed very real, and they were usually interesting, or funny, or both.  However, as fear and paranoia grabbed a hold of the characters, these people became increasingly less interesting.  By the time the ending came around, I wasn't enjoying myself anymore, and I was completely indifferent towards the final moments.  The acting was surprisingly good for a low-budget flick, and the story wasn't too bad, but there was nothing chilling or scary about this movie.  This was an admirable effort when you consider the lack of movie-making experience (not to mention the lack of money), but in the end, this comes up short.",5,0,2,30 April 2000
Antz," A nice change of pace
","I went into 'Antz' expecting a Disney-like animated effort, but while this was definitely not what I had anticipated, it was no less entertaining than a typical Disney picture.  Refreshingly, this was more sophisticated than most animated features, and I can only assume that adults may have enjoyed this more than the kids.  While it is lacking in zany humor and outrageous characters that are standard in many animated films, it still succeeds thanks to a more cerebral approach that includes more subtle comedy, as well as some surprisingly graphic (but effective) violence.  The film was also helped by some terrific casting decisions, and an ending that was especially great.  All in all, this isn't the best animated film that I've ever seen, but it's one of the most satisfying.",8,0,0,5 October 1999
Se7en," Riveting
","What can I say about this film that hasn't been said time and time again. Everything about this film is first-rate, especially the hugely talented cast.  Is it even possible to make a bad movie with Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey?  The actors hammered home a script that was chilling, disturbing, and altogether memorable in every imaginable way.  And then to top it all off, this movie has what is probably the most magnificent ending that I have ever seen.  If you can handle the content of this film, then it is truly a must-see.",10,0,0,18 January 1999
Spice World," It's not THAT bad
","Okay, so the number of jokes that went 'thud' were plentiful, but there were a few redeeming qualities to this generally weak movie.  Surprisingly enough, I'd actually have to say that the Spice Girls were rather enjoyable in this flick, and I genuinely feel that they could make a good movie so long as the script writers actually gave the plot some thought.  I also thought that they poked fun at themselves quite nicely, and even showed a bit of talent for comedy.  A BIT.  Unfortunately, you can't help but feel that this film was thrown together in far too short a time to actually have a good final result.",4,1,4,11 January 1999
L.A. Confidential," All-around great film
","This film is outstanding in most every way, for it has a great script, a great look, and of course, great acting.  Unfortunately, it was disappointing to see that the weakest lead performance in the film was the one that was chosen as Oscar-worthy.  Don't get me wrong, Basinger was fine, but this film was best when she was nowhere to be found.  Quite simply, all of the male leads deserved Oscar nominations, and I don't remember the last time that I saw a film with so many excellent performances.  This is a must-see.",10,1,1,20 March 1999
Over the Top," Nothing special
","This predictable movie really isn't all that bad, but it isn't all that good, either.  On the plus side, the film kept me somewhat entertained, and even though the end result of the tournament was painfully obvious, I found the arm wrestling scenes to be very enjoyable.  Unfortunately, several of the conversations (especially some father-son talks) throughout this film aren't very good, and there were a few scenes in this movie that seemed needless, silly, and basically, over the top.  This isn't a bad way to kill some time, but if you're looking for serious entertainment, please try something else.",5,1,3,30 April 2000
Glory," Not quite as good as it should have been
","As something of an American Civil War buff, I was hoping and maybe even expecting to love this movie.  Unfortunately, there was something missing, although I can't really identify what wasn't there.  Technically speaking, the film is flawless.  The recreations are truly stunning, and the acting is about as good as it gets.  So I'm not really sure how to accurately criticize this picture, since my rational thinking tells me that this movie had it all.  Then again, perhaps I have just identified the problem, for I am reflecting on this film not with my heart, but with my head.",8,3,6,7 February 1999
Top Secret!," Starts slow, but gets much better
","The first half of this movie has all kinds of jokes, but unfortunately, very few of them were funny.  However, much to my surprise, this film gets MUCH funnier in the second half.  Therefore, I definitely recommend this movie, but I strongly suggest that you fast-forward through most of the first 45 minutes.  Once you reach the halfway point, sit back and prepare to laugh your head off.",7,1,2,24 April 2000
Fargo," Decent, but certainly not Oscar-worthy
","What is all of the fuss about?  Yes, this is a very well-acted film, but the script definitely is not worthy of such a talented cast.  This film was okay, but it is often slow and uninteresting, and it never came close to meeting my expectations.  Some scenes seem pointless, others just don't work, and by the end I just didn't really care about this movie anymore.  As if we needed more proof, this stands as further evidence that the Motion Picture Academy members tend to have no clue.",5,2,5,10 October 1999
Notting Hill," Starts off well, then...
","For the first forty minutes, I was really enjoying this film.  There were several funny scenes at the beginning, and Hugh Grant did a great job of making the humor work.  Then, things bogged down.  The film became less of a comedy and more of a romance, and this killed the movie.  Without funny moments to keep me interested, the film crawled along, and I was very relieved when the obvious conclusion finally took place.  Don't expect too much from this movie.",5,1,3,17 May 2000
Duck Soup," Duck and cover
","I am genuinely mystified.  Make a movie with silly sight gags, a barrage of one-liners and all-around craziness in the 1990's, and the film is labelled as a pathetic comedy.  Yet that is all you find in 'Duck Soup', and it is regarded as one of the classic comedies all of time.  Sure, I can understand how people want to pay homage to the pioneers of film, but all that the Marx Bros. did was to introduce the film-going public to prolonged stretches of insanity.  This was a HUGE disappointment.",3,25,47,11 November 1998
54," One fairly dull party
","A group of dull, unappealing characters ruin what could have been an enjoyable look back at Studio 54.  Save possibly for Rubell, no one is even remotely interesting in this movie.  For me, at least, there was no reason to like any of the other main players, and so the film dragged quite frequently.  This isn't a complete disaster, since it does have the occasional entertaining scene and some decent performances, but in general, it's predictable and uninspired.  Don't waste your time with this one.",4,2,3,31 March 2000
Liar Liar," Not hilarious, but still good
","This wasn't the laugh riot that I was hoping for, but I'd still have to call it a good movie.  There were a few rather funny moments, but overall, I'd call it more pleasant than funny.  To some extent, I would actually have to say that this film worked best when it had a more dramatic edge to it.  It wasn't especially memorable by any stretch, but at least it kept me interested and reasonably entertained throughout, and I find that most comedies aren't capable of doing that for me.",6,0,3,19 April 1999
Good Will Hunting," Almost lives up to the hype
","Despite some annoying flaws, I would still have to call this a great movie. I didn't at all mind that the film was a little far-fetched.  Instead, what bothered me was that the scenes that were supposed to be the most emotionally charged did nothing for me.  Considering how effective the movie usually was, it was very irritating to have a couple of scenes that didn't seem to work.  But it was still a great movie, thanks in large part to a generally solid script and terrific acting by everyone involved, especially Robin Williams, who should give up comedies entirely, since he's such a tremendous talent when given a dramatic part.  This film isn't the instant classic that many have built it up to be, but it is still a really good film that is definitely worth seeing.",9,2,7,20 March 1999
From Dusk Till Dawn," Can Tarantino do no wrong?
","Right from the opening scene, I was hooked.  I keep on telling myself that I shouldn't have loved this movie...but I did.  It's unbelievable.  Tarantino could write a good movie while in a coma, he's so talented.  The action is fun, the acting is solid, and the laughs range from amusing to downright hilarious.  This is EASILY the best action/horror movie that I've ever seen, and probably one of the ten best films I've seen of any genre, period.",10,0,0,10 December 1998
Jerry Maguire," Outstanding
","A terrific mix of light comedy and several heartwarming moments make this film one of the most enjoyable film experiences that I've ever had. Cruise, Zellweger, and Gooding all gave excellent performances, and their characters are among the most likable that I've ever seen.  Also deserving of praise are the football action scenes, surprisingly good performances by the children, and a great script that always kept me interested.  I strongly recommend this one to all who have not yet had the good fortune to see it.",10,11,25,28 March 1999
Annie Hall," DULL!
","This is probably the most disappointing film that I have ever seen.  I was generally pleased with the Woody Allen films that I had seen before this, so I was very eager to sit down and watch the film that is generally considered to be his best.  I was shocked by how bad this film was.  The first half of this film was bearable, since I was still expecting something entertaining to happen.  By the second half, I was completely uninterested, and it was really about as boring as a film can get.  I'm sure that the occasional bad review like this one won't stop people from watching this 'classic', but to those who saw this film and didn't like it, I just needed to let you know that you're not alone.",3,17,35,10 April 1999
Pulp Fiction," The best film ever?
","There isn't much that I can say that hasn't already been said, but I'll give my opinion anyway.  Quite simply, this movie is magnificent, and possibly the best that I've ever seen.  This film is a seemingly endless series of unforgettable moments that make for an indescribably enjoyable movie-going experience.  EVERYTHING about this film is top-notch.  The Travolta-Jackson conversations are flat-out hilarious, the Uma Thurman sequence is the ultimate wild ride, and the Bruce Willis segment was as riveting and nerve-wracking as anything that I've ever seen.  I could go on and on for forever about this movie, and I almost feel sorry for those of you who still haven't seen this masterpiece.",10,1,2,13 June 1999
Titanic," Outstanding
","The first half of this movie focused on a romance that I did not care about, and yet, I was still somehow engrossed by it all.  Rationally, I can understand that the story was fairly ordinary, but somehow, I was riveted. This is something that I cannot explain.  For every scene after the iceberg is first spotted, however, I can fully understand why I loved this movie so much.  The action scenes in this film are absolutely jaw-dropping, and this fact is the primary reason why this is one of my favorite films.  However, I can certainly agree with those who found this to be a real tearjerker. Seeing so many innocent people preparing to die is heartbreaking in the extreme, and these scenes will always stand out as some of the finest that I will ever see.  But make no mistake about it, I view this as an action film first, not as a emotional drama.  And since I view it this way, I strongly encourage action fans who somehow avoided this movie to give it a chance, because heart-pounding entertainment doesn't get any better than this.",10,2,4,13 June 1999
Hercules," Slow start, great finish
","It took a little while to get going, but once it did, this film is on a par with any of the recent Disney animated greats.  The animation, although not nearly on the level of most recent efforts, did grow on me after some time, and did seem to fit the movie fairly well.  The humour was certainly hit-and-miss, but the story was generally fine and the ending was particularly enjoyable.  So even with a relatively lackluster beginning, this film eventually did display the terrific animated storytelling that Disney does so very well, and so I can heartily endorse this film.",8,0,1,2 February 1999
All Quiet on the Western Front," Sadly, has not aged well
","I can understand how this film would have been so well-received back when it first came out, but quite simply, time has not been kind to this movie.  In my opinion, this film is far too slow-moving and simplistic to be considered a masterpiece, much like most of the early films that are considered classics today.  This film was far too tame to have an impact on me, and I must confess that I found it to be frequently boring as well.  I can certainly appreciate the effort that was put forth, and I can recognize that a great deal of talent worked on this film, but by today's standards, this movie just doesn't measure up.",4,11,38,24 April 1999
The Bridge on the River Kwai," A 'classic' that I actually liked!
","I can freely admit that I don't watch many movies that weren't made in the past thirty years, mainly because I usually find them to be far too slow. This film proved to be an exception.  While I did find it to take some time before it really got going, there were more than enough great moments to keep me watching with enthusiasm throughout.  Everything about this film is first-rate, and there is no question that it deserved the armload of Oscars that it won over four decades ago.  Now, I'm not going to say that it's one of the greatest films that I've ever seen, but I did feel that it was a very good film, and considering how I usually regard films made from this era, that is VERY high praise.",8,2,5,2 April 1999
Scream 2," As mediocre as the first
","I liked this about as much as the original, which I didn't really care for. This sequel is somewhat funnier and arguably more clever than the original, but it is just as annoying, and the characters seem to be even more stupid than in the first.  Here's hoping that the survivors of part two all die a quick and painful death in part three.  After all, these characters have been trying their hardest to die in the first two 'Scream' movies, and have only been unsuccessful because the killers have been even more dense than the potential victims.  Killing the leads would redeem the whole series.",5,0,0,23 October 1999
The Waterboy," Occasionally funny, but generally dull
","Okay, I can admit that I did find this film to be funny at times, especially at the beginning, but this really isn't a funny movie.  Most of the humor just didn't work for me, and towards the end of the movie, I was getting somewhat bored while waiting for the predictable climax.  There is some good talent that is wasted in this movie, and I am still trying to figure out what convinced Kathy Bates to appear in this movie.  She is WAY too talented to spend her time repeating dumb lines and dancing on the sidelines.  And as for Adam Sandler, I think that he can be a funny guy, but he needs to stop playing all these misfit oddballs and make more films like 'The Wedding Singer'.  He needs to learn that stupidity is not necessarily funny.",4,2,3,26 April 1999
The Cannonball Run," Watchable, but really stupid
","I'll confess that there were a few times when I laughed while watching this film, as much as I hate to admit that fact.  Nevertheless, this film is about as brainless and plotless as major motion pictures can get.  Most of the jokes land hard with a thud, and the racing scenes are standard at best. It is a mildly amusing distraction, but let's face it, you can do MUCH better than this if you're looking for a good time.  Watch only if you have the need to see an enormous bunch of talent being pitifully wasted.",4,3,5,24 March 1999
Scream," Not bad, but often annoying
","Yes, this horror movie does have some clever moments, but in general, I found this movie to be very irritating.  Kevin Williamson tried to make an intelligent horror film, and his script never lets us forget that he believes that he succeeded.  This movie had some decent suspense, it was well-paced, and it had a terrific young cast, but towards the end, I just didn't care who was killing everybody.  I just hoped that the killer would finish the job so that a sequel couldn't be made.  Oh well...",5,0,2,23 October 1999
Mr. Holland's Opus," Excellent film, with even better music
","Richard Dreyfuss is outstanding (as is the whole cast) in this thoroughly enjoyable film.  I really liked it the first time, but with repeated viewings, I'd say that this film got even better.  It's a little predictable, but so what?  For me, it was impossible not to care about these characters, and the ending was the perfect heartwarming note to go out on. It was rather funny as well, but my favourite thing about this movie was the music.  It seems only fitting, considering the importance of music to this film, that it would have a great number of songs, but I was astonished by how much I LOVED the music in this movie.  All-in-all, this was a completely satisfying film, and I would call it a must-see.",10,54,65,6 May 1999
The Sixth Sense," Somewhat disappointing
","Even with the huge box office returns and critical acclaim, I still didn't have high expectations for this movie.  Nevertheless, I was still expecting this to be a good movie, but it was merely decent.  I did like the ending quite a bit, and the acting was solid throughout, but in general, the film was uninteresting and rarely entertaining.  That's not to say that I was frequently bored throughout, but I was generally indifferent to the characters and to the on-screen happenings.  It's an adequate time killer, but not much more.",5,2,3,11 April 2000
The Truman Show," Perhaps already a classic
","There's not much that I can say that hasn't already been said several times before, so I'll keep it brief.  I have rarely seen a film as well-crafted and as flawlessly thought-out.  The whole cast was terrific, the direction was outstanding, and there's really nothing that stands out as a weak link. Oscar or no Oscar, this film has already secured an important place in Hollywood's history, and justifiably so.",10,0,0,2 February 1999
Jackie Brown," A great movie, but a slight disappointment
","Only Quentin Tarantino could make a film this good and leave me somewhat disappointed.  This film was probably his most intelligent film yet, and there's no question that this is a terrific film, but after the thrills of 'Pulp Fiction', I was expecting more than a great movie.  Perhaps more than anything, what this film lacked was the hilarious dialogue that was practically non-stop in his earlier films.  There may even be a little too much heart in this film.  I know that I'm being picky, but once you find a formula that works, don't mess with it.  Tarantino is still probably the best director alive, and this film does nothing to change that, but this is still a step back for him.",9,0,0,12 February 1999
The Wedding Singer," MUCH better than I expected it to be
","The generally annoying Adam Sandler actually comes through as likable for once, and that is one of the keys to this movie being a surprisingly fun ride.  Sure, it's predictable, it's formulaic, and it's a little too heavy with 80's references, but I have to admit that I had a smile on my face for practically the whole thing.  Aside from Sandler, Billy Idol was fun to watch, Steve Buscemi's brief appearances were terrific, and Drew Barrymore was especially adorable and effective.  This was a great movie.  Go figure.",9,2,2,18 February 1999
