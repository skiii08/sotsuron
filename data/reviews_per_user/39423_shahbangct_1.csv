Blade Runner 2049," Good, but not great
","Okay first of all before l get started about my review on this, l want to say that the first Blade Runner is my all-time favorite movie, it's fantastic in my eyes and a real work of art in the Sci Fi genre. As for Blade Runner 2049...I was a little disappointed. Lets go over the positives first. This movie is stunning and beautiful to look at, the cinematography is brilliant! It's truthfully mind blowing and almost worth the price of admission alone. This movie also had a lot of interesting Sci Fi elements that are new and innovative, like Ryan Gosling's holographic girlfriend. I've never seen anything quite like it, it was pretty cool. The actors were all very strong in their performances, so much so that it left me wanting more from certain characters. I really enjoyed Jared Leto's performance, he's pulls off an especially creepy and mysterious character. I wanted more Leto to be honest. Negatives This film is slow and too long! And I love slow movies usually! They unnecessarily stretch scenes out to the point where you're bored....and as a BIG Blade Runner fan it pains me to say that! I'm upset actually that l felt this way about this movie. The movie has pacing issues for sure. I also found the main plot of the story a little thin, it wasn't hard to get lost in this movie and wonder where are they going with this? They tried to throw a twist in, but truthfully when the twist is unraveled or revealed I didn't care, it was underwhelming. For a movie being 2 hrs 40 minutes l actually expected more out of it. Certain scenes were too long and drawn out, and other parts were sorrily lacking depth. The original Blade Runner story is way better in my opinion. Also Harrison Ford doesn't even show up until the last 40 minutes and by the end of movie I thought to myself, 'did they even really need him?' Overall the movie is OK, which again sucks for me to say, because if the pacing and story was a little bit stronger and things flowed a bit better this movie could have easily been a 10/10 for Sci Fi. To sum it all up it's a good movie with some extraordinary visuals and very cool Sci Fi technology/elements and the acting is strong, but has serious pacing problems, it's too long and the story is average. LOL the first Blade Runner has a faster pace! So to all those people who thought the first one was slow, don't even bother with this one. I would definitely watch Blade Runner 2049 again as I feel I could definitely learn new things and l want to see if my opinion changes to a more positive one. Overall my rating is a 7/10.....barely.",7,1,6,7 October 2017
