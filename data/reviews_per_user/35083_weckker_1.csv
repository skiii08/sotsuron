The Devil's Advocate," astonishing then, astonishing now
","I saw this movie back in '97 in the theatre. It was running just a week after Cameron's Titanic. I remember the crowds that rushed to see Titanic, and an almost empty room when this movie was playing. After seeing this I thought how unbalanced is this creativity (originality) vs big budget blockbusters on one side, and the number of viewers on the other side. Later I realised that blockbusters are for the masses, and interesting movies like this one are for the few who can see beyond the FX and the small little girls tears. I was just a kid back then. I watched it again last night. And although I knew the ending, it was an awesome ride, and the ending gave me the same shivers as the fist time. If you haven't seen this one - go get it, if you have - watch it again. It never gets old, nor boring.",10,11,11,13 September 2010
