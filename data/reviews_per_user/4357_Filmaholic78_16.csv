Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Great film. Highly recommend it to everyone
","This was either going to be a complete success or a complete let down. Thank god it was a success.I wouldn't go as far as to say it was better than the first film but by no means was it poor. The first film set a very high standard as far as Sherlock Holmes films goes and this one was almost back at that same level.The acting, directing, cinematography, style and presentation are of the highest caliber. The story is fun and entertaining but at the same time clever and intriguing. Everything you would want really with the emphasis on ENTERTAINING.I could easily watch this film again and can't wait to add this one to my DVD collection when it becomes available.If I had any criticism that I had to mention I would say there is probably too much action to the point where the whole Sherlock punch ups become slightly repetitive. Only a minor thing and I will let you make your own mind up on that one.If you haven't seen it yet what are you waiting for?????",8,1,2,11 January 2012
Sucker Punch," Beautifully crafted visual feast with a serious story
","Before I watched Sucker Punch I felt this film could either be a load of garbage or a masterpiece. Thank god it wasn't garbage.The special effects are just phenomenal, the story fantastic, the action is crazy and the girls are hot hot hot. On that note don't for one second think this is just a blokes film, yes it's full of flawlessly gorgeous looking girls and makes great eye candy but it is the story that is the key to its success.You have got to be open minded to enjoy Sucker Punch as it takes a straight forward story and implements two further versions of itself. Very hard to describe without spoiling the film but it keeps you absolutely mesmarised the entire way from start to finish.The trailers may have you thinking this is an action film along the lines of dungeons and dragons or final fantasy however it is actually a very dark portrayal of a young girls battle against time and is all centred around abuse, betrayal, deceit, manipulation and just the sheer will to survive.When I left the cinema after watching Sucker Punch I actually said to my friend that I hadn't made my mind up if I liked it or not. It's hard to explain but I found myself playing the film over and over in my head that night and realised the more I thought about it the more I loved it.One thing I will say however is you have to see this film on the big screen, I feel that it might not come across as well on DVD as it is just mind blowing. Yes it isn't an action film, it's primarily a drama/thriller however it probably has MORE action in it than any action film out there!!!! My god does it just go all out crazy.So to sum this film up. 1) Totally hot babes. Check. 2) Great story. Check 3) Fantastic Special Effects. Check. 4) Amazing mind blowing crazy ass action. Check 5) Totally hot babes. Check",8,3,7,4 April 2011
Inglourious Basterds," Not as good as I had hoped
","I will keep this short.Bit of a let down, Had some good moments. The first 10 minutes of the film are just gripping. Then fell flat. Some action, some script, o.k acting but I left just feeling that it should or could have been better.Yes I laughed and cringed and the cinematography is done well but it wasn't enough to save this film. I almost wish he stayed with the original story instead of just taking the title and inventing a completely different story all together.Don't get me wrong I am a massive Tarantino fan. His work is truly amazing but this just didn't seem to have that flare he normally possesses.",5,9,18,13 September 2009
Orphan," Great Horror/Thriller
","Well what can I say that the title doesn't already sum up?For all Horror/Thriller fans I can safely say you will enjoy this film. I went to see the Orphan without knowing much about it except that 'There is something wrong with Esther'. I wasn't sure if it was going to be supernatural, slasher, horror etc. I still don't really know what to label it as but I tell you what I loved it and I was literally on the edge of my seat for most of the film.Two thumbs up for this one. It is well shot. Good acting by most of the cast and plenty of twists and turns that will keep you guessing to the end.There's something wrong with Esther is a complete under statement. I don't want to spoil any of the story so all I can say is watch it. You will not be disappointed",9,2,4,10 August 2009
Underworld Awakening," Meh.....Okay I guess
",I'm not sure why this film seems to be getting fantastic reviews. I mean it was a good enough action flick but it didn't blow my mind. In fact it was a case of the same old stuff just done better. Brilliant to watch but not refreshing at the same time. The story was lacking in depth and character development and just felt like a filler for another sequel.I don't want to be all doom and gloom about it because Kate really did kick some ass and looked good doing it too so as far as action and eye candy goes its great. But any fan of the series knows that the Underworld saga isn't stupid. They always paid attention to script and story and that was lacking here unfortunately.I'm sure if you go and see it you wont be disappointed but just leave your brains at the door and watch the action commence.,7,93,138,23 January 2012
District 9," It's a grower!!!
",I went to see this film not believing the hype as I wasn't all that impressed with the trailers that had been released and the fact that all Peter Jackson really had to do with the film is provide second hand special effects from his dropped 'Halo' from game to screen project.Perhaps 20 minutes had passed and I was starting to think that my initial thoughts were correct and found myself slightly disappointed. Then before I realised it I was hooked. The story is intriguing and all be it the special effects are a bit un finished looking the clever directing and filming cover this up very well.I have to say I did enjoy District 9. Perhaps it's not as good as the hype and lets face it there is a lot of it but it is a lot better than most of the films coming out of Hollywood recently.,9,2,5,5 September 2009
Twilight," A great adaptation of the book
","Yes I am a man And yes I liked this film My partner loved it and I have to admit I really did enjoy it Good acting, cast & story. It was directed and shot very well. After watching the film I bought the 4 books and after reading the first one (and getting hooked straight away) I was very surprised to find that unlike a lot of novel adaptations this film was very very close to being spot on.I have to warn you this is not a vampire action flick. If you are hoping for one then you could be disappointed. I say could be because I thought it was an action flick, well so my girlfriend made me believe and I forgave her straight away as the story is truly compelling and different to a lot of garbage coming out of Hollywood recently.Role on the sequel.",10,4,10,1 June 2009
Drag Me to Hell," The only film I have ever got up and left the cinema half way through
","I was looking forward to seeing this film due to the great reviews. Even Empire gave it the thumbs up. I was so, so, so let down. The acting was terrible, the story was so so. The special effects where dated. I would swear it was over 10 years old by the look of them. The only shocks I got where from the volume. I swear I am half deaf now.I know Sam is the genius behind evil dead etc. If I knew this was going to be the same style of film with the same budget I would of waited for the DVD.Don't get me wrong I love those films just not enough to spend money at the cinema. I feel the hype has set it up for a fall. Please take this as a warning if you decide to go and watch it. It is loud, silly and not at all scary with bad special effects, acting and script.",1,15,35,31 May 2009
Super 8," Loved it!!!!!!!
","I have got to say Super 8 was a breath of fresh air. I have read a few of the reviews here on IMDb and have to agree with them that the film does have the old Steven Spielberg, E.T feel and in my books that is a great thing, however it is not any any shape or form the same as E.T, I just wanted to make that clear from the start. The references to the directing style and E.T are more centred around the story telling and feel of Super 8 not the actual physical content.J.J Abrams gives us a masterclass in writing and directing. He somehow manages to capture your attention and draw you in to the film, the actors, mainly the children, do the film proud and it is fascinating to see them act well at acting bad. (This will make sense once you have watched the film). It has everything you want from action to comedy, drama to romance and it is all seamlessly weaved together.I absolutely loved Super 8, it's an instant classic and recommend it to anyone.Go and see it.",Null,0,0,11 August 2011
Thor," If you like Marvel then you will like this.
","Firstly I want to point out that I am giving this film 8 out of 10 on the basis that it is a Marvel super hero action film. To review it any other way would be unfair. It doesn't take itself seriously, sticks to the comic book characters well and also links in well with the other Avenger stories / SHIELD i.e Iron man, Hulk and probably Captain America.It contains everything needed to make it fun and entertaining with lots of action, great special effects, a few laughs and then topped off with more action.My only issue was that I went to see it in 3D and felt it really didn't need it. In fact I thought it was more of a distraction than anything else when it was used and that didn't seem to be very often, therefore you watch the majority of the film slightly blurred for only a few minutes of real 3D. If I could rewind time I would probably have preferred just to go and watch the 2D version.All in all though it was just a good film and if you do go and see it just remember what your going to watch, a film adaptation from a comic book, not a serious drama or some artsy fartsy garbage. Just sheer stupid unrealistic fun.",8,2,7,26 April 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Great end to a fantastic story
","I haven't read the books yet so perhaps I enjoyed this film more than true Potter Fenatics. All I can say is I'm sure they will have missed loads of the original story out but unless you are aware of whats missing the film as a whole is great. In the defence for the Director and Producers I would imagine there was just far too much to cram in to the film and some of it possibly wouldn't have translated well on to screen so this has to be forgiven. Doesn't it? Any way I have loved all the films from year 1 to year 7 and it was nice to have David Yates back to direct this one. He stuck to his guns and this second instalment carries on with the same feel as the previous few he made. I found the first films all felt slightly different and disjointed, with each director, quite rightly, putting their own spin on them however with David at the helm there is more consistency here.The acting is surprising good for a change, the special effects are off the hook and the action is captured perfectly. What I will say is, and this is starting to be a common occurrence in my honest opinion, that the 3D doesn't actually add anything to the film. When you consider you pay more for the 3D experience you would expect more. It doesn't ruin the film but just doesn't do, well anything for it.One last thing I will say is that if you live in Cheltenham or the Cotswolds for that matter I recommend you go and watch Harry Potter in the new screening rooms that Cineworld have opened here. It's a completely new experience for a day out at the cinema, you are greeted when you walk in, served drinks and food in the waiting area, escorted to your seats, which by the way are huge, made from leather and have a table and ice bucket, and then before the film starts have at seat service. This just added to the fun and comfort and I can't stress enough how much it made the overall experience just that bit more special. Here is the link to the Screening rooms website if your interested http://www.thescreeningrooms.co.uk To sum Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2 up. A great ending to a Fantstic story and it doesn't disappoint.",8,0,1,16 July 2011
50_50," I didn't want to watch this film. So glad I did
","Cancer and Comedy.Two things that should never be mixed together. However 50/50 does, and it works. Using the phrase comedy is slightly miss leading to be honest in this case. There are some really nice light comedic references/situations that lighten the mood of the film without detracting from the seriousness of it but in essence it is a drama. A heart felt, well written, well directed and extremely well acted masterpiece.In a nutshell it is a very believable journey of not only one mans struggle with cancer but also the effects it has on people around him.Before I went to see the film I was very apprehensive as just the thought of cancer makes my stomach turn and the last thing I wanted to do is watch something depressing and upsetting. Both of these elements rarely make it in to 50/50 and I just sat back and enjoyed it from start to finish. What a great story and a great film. I highly recommend you go and see this one.",10,1,2,1 December 2011
The Ugly Truth," Another GREAT Romcom for 2009
","I now believe that 2009 should be dubbed the year of the Romcom.I was dragged to see the proposal by my girlfriend and thought it was hilarious. When she wanted to go and see The Ugly Truth I found myself putting up less of a fight this time. And I'm glad.This film is HILARIOUS. I have to say I enjoyed almost every second from start to finish. It truly is designed for both men and women with fantastic views on romance, sex, attraction etc from both sides.Acting is great, story is great and the chemistry between Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler works very well on screen.To sum this film up I have to say watch it. Make your own mind up. But I bet you won't be disappointed and I bet you can't stop yourself from one agreeing with some of the points made and two laughing out loud.",9,99,161,6 August 2009
The Social Network," Just a great story of something we now take for granted
","I give this film 10 out of 10.I'm not sure how much is truth and how much is fiction but what I will say is I enjoyed it from start to end.The filming, script, story and acting are of the best quality.It's just a complete eye opener as to how facebook was born and the problems and success it created for all those involved.Whats great is the story is based around something that has become such a household name and that it's something we can relate to without knowing much about where it came from, how and why.Loved it",10,6,8,23 November 2010
The Proposal," Everything a romcom should be
","O.K this film will not win any Oscars O.K. there might be a few plot holes.But as Romcom's go this sits near the top of the pile.Very very FUNNY. Great cast and acting. Story is fresh and did I say FUNNY.I loved it, my girlfriend loved it and from the sound of the audience in the cinema they all enjoyed it as well. Because there is nothing better than the atmosphere of a full house laughing together in unison.Two thumbs up for this one if you are looking for a film to go to on a date or with some friends.",7,0,3,25 July 2009
The Fighter," 10 out of 10. Favourite film so far of 2011
","This film is an instant classic. Forget that it's based around boxing, it is not in any way a modern Rocky or stupid unbelievable action film. This is real acting, a real story and a real masterpiece all rolled in to one. I defy anyone to write a bad review or dislike this film. It really is that good. Mark Wahlberg plays his part perfectly, however all credit has to go to Christian Bale. This is method acting at its best. It will be a crime if he doesn't win an award for this performance. He steals every scene he is in and does it so well he really is just unrecognisable as Christian Bale. The story just sucks you in and by the end you feel so fired up you just want to jump out of your seat and join in. Great film, fantastic cast, brilliant directing. Just amazing. Go and watch this one. You will not be disappointed.",10,2,4,15 February 2011
