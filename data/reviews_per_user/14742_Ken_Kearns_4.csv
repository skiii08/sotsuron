Rocketman," Musical Fantasy hiding a Biography
","For fans of Elton John, the songs are the calling cards. Using the complete discography to tell Elton's story is accomplished with great selections that we all know and love.Interestingly, nothing from Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy, which was the biography LP in 1975 of Elton and Bernie's career, made it as a song selection. (the first LP to debut at Number 1 in music history)Fortunately, I was able to watch Rocket Man a second time which brought into focus how the fantasy process was being used to tell Elton's story.Overall, this is very enjoyable and reveals that it will take a mini-series to chronologically and accurately tell Elton's story. I mean he has had a Number One song in FOUR different decades.That is the internal conflict for long time Elton fans when a movie shows Grow Some Funk of Your Own as a song earlier in his life and career than Madman Across the Water. The first was from 1975 and the second was from 1971.(note: neither song is in the movie and only serve as examples)So really, what you have is a musical fantasy that is hiding a biography and it is really well done.",9,1,1,15 October 2019
Saving Mr. Banks," Great Story Telling
","This is a movie that found me. Having been enchanted by Disneyland in California in the early 1970s at a young age.Nothing like watching color tv and The Wonderful World of Disney and then traveling to visit the Magical Kingdom.1968's Jungle Book was my first Disney Movie in the theater, however, just as the Mickey Mouse club allowed for the building of Disneyland, it was Mary Poppins that brought further success not only in movie making, but the building of Disneyworld in Florida.This is the story behind the story and although I did not see it in the theater, I stood and Clapped at the end of this movie. Bravo!10 out of 10.",10,0,0,13 October 2019
Rear Window," Top 5 Reference Movie Genius
",The introduction of Rear Window for me was in Cinema History class at EKU. Thelma Ritter is pure gold and the perfect foil for James Stewart and Grace Kelly.Masterful story telling and the writing/dialog is excellent. One of my top 5 reference movies and highlights the genius of Hitchcock.This film has a little of everything and is a 'Readers Digest' filled with character studies all from the Rear Window.10 for 10,10,0,0,12 October 2019
