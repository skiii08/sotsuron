Marie Antoinette," Longest fragrance commercial ever !
","Hi! I'll start for the hardest critic. The real achievement of this movie is that you really understand the character's boredom of living by living it in your own flesh.Since the beginning of the movie its clear that its entirely thought as a woman understanding another woman while writing the script. But while it could be a good point, it becomes a repetitive series of clichés and the plot turns into a mix between soap opera and cheap romantic novel full of misunderstanding and dissatisfaction.Finally, from the artistic side, it tries to disguise the lack of budget with 'artistic shots', while, if the intention was to create an artistic movie, budget should not be the problem. That can be also applied to the scoring side of the movie.Casting, and performances are OK, if this was a short movie it would have been pretty good one, but at the end ... too many pink macaroons.",4,3,5,6 January 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Luca's Revenge
","Wow! Great last 10 minutes when someone at Lucas Films said 'hey, the next one has a 70's look' and you see that in those 10 minutes star ships, customs and scenarios roll back to the very beginning of this saga. Great flashback to when I was 9 and got amazed for the very first time by Star Wars.It took George Lucas 2 sequels to achieve one that deserves to be watched no matter if you like the saga or not. Actually my wife, who hates everything related to SW, enjoyed the movie.<ul><li>Acting are at their best  well don't expect any award in this area anyway. - Storyline has fewer 'downs' than in the previous films. - Dialogs are faster and accurate. - CGI accumulated during this last 8 years (that includes the refurbishing of the previous 3 installments) are simply spectacular, even riding sequences that looked awkward in 'Attack of the Clones' are now unspotted. Just remarkable! - And above all, action from start to end.</li></ul>The only thing I think would have required more time is to make a believable path for Anakin Skywalker from 'I want to save my wife' to 'I kill every Jedi including kids' that happens in a matter of minutes and being this the last movie of the saga, ¿would it had hurt, if instead of 140 minutes it was 150?Anyway, I'm just guessing here, but it won't surprise me if George Lucas releases these last three movies in 'director's cut' or 'extended versions' to add those minutes  and some 'just baked extra-CGI'.Go to the theater, and enjoy!",8,1,5,19 May 2005
