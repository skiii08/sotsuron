Black Swan," The swansong never stops playing.
","Black Swan not only centres on the concept of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's (1840 - 1893) ballet Swan Lake, but it too revolves around the work and life of its lead ballerina Nina Sayers and the commitment that she has to endure to bring this production to life. Such is the extreme physical and mental preparations for this role that the lead role, as both Odette and Odile, has to convince both audience and herself that she is literally, in all respects, the part, this magical mystical creature, inevitably metamorphosing into a realm of fantasy and horror.The insurmountable pressure here can only have adverse effects on those not strong willed enough to withstand its all-consuming glory. Black Swan is not just a film about an Old Russian folk's tale nor is it only about the role of its leading lady; this film measures the true understanding and meaning of what is to be the lead in the most prestigious ballet; Swan Lake.Darren Aronofsky (The Fountain-2006, The Wrestler-2008) has given us an insight into the mind that is tormented between the two roles of both white and black queens and her struggle to fully understand the line between reality and illusion. It is a parallel of these dual roles and the division of her mind, which must be controlled, as to shine and to remain sane, remain one.This world of tension and paranoia is beautifully shot and timed to a tee, the claustrophobic, imploding mind's journey here is, too, bittersweet, what with the charming and seductive cinematography it leads itself to a tone and fashion liken to J-horror with a Hitchcock bent, all adding to the flavour of both beauty and bestiality. It is also the films major gift, the stupendous acting of its leading lady Natalie Portman, magnificently delicate and brittle, which personifies her declining into plight and anguish. We see her every contorted expression that feeds her insecurities, fears and anxieties, such a tender fragile spirit on the spiral into the abyss of pure perfection. With perfection, too, comes rejection, and we see a paradox in terms of Ms. Sayers and her inauguration into this highly demanding role and the now retired Swan Queen Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder) who shows a mental instability on a different path that leads to her self harming. With or without the role of Swan Queen, she still claims her victims; the swansong is sung and there is no more. It is a perpetual cycle of love and hate, have and have not, life and death, black or white.This is the major theme of Black Swan, finding ones new inner self and transcending this inner being and the consequences that can lend itself to, it is a topic of, together, self-doubt and self discovery and using the dual roles that is Swan Lake's Queen's is a fitting metaphor for Nina Sayers conflicting personality.It is a schism that runs although this film, suffering for its art. It is not a pleasant experience to have to witness this transformation, it is a fitting example of a world of dedication, such as the training and sacrifice in which this world of ballerinas' must partake, to become more than the best, more than excellent, to be pure perfection.",8,0,3,21 January 2011
Scarface," The world wasn't enough. Tony Montana wanted everything!
","Alphonse 'Scarface' Capone (1899 - 1947) infamous reputation as gangster and crime Lord during the 1920's and 1930's had now reached the movies. It begins with Ben Hecht (1894 - 1964) writer of The Front Page (1931), Angels with Dirty Faces (1938) and Stagecoach (1939), and with director / writer Howard Hawks (1896 - 1977) who gave us such greats, as writer, The French Connection (1971) and The Thing from Another World (1951). Collaborating, during the early nineteen thirties, to write and direct the original Scarface of 1932. It is here, in this story that Oliver Stone (b. 1946) takes his lead as screenwriter for his contemporary adaptation of this gangster myth.Cuba was having very real and severe problems by the end of the nineteen seventies with its political, social and economic unrest and between April to October 1980, some 125,000 Cubans had jumped ship and sailed to the then Jimmy Carter administrative (1977 to 1981) US of A. The reason the exiles had to be stopped toward the end was that it was alleged that some 25,000, so far, of these self-claimed political refugees were convicts, mental patents and undesirables that Cuba no longer wanted on their home ground. America shut its gates, but the damage had been done. The likes of fictional Tony Montana, ex convict, had already arrived and planted his roots in the dark, dangerous and destructive world of America's drug world.Together, Brian De Palma (b. 1940) maker of Carrie (1976), The Untouchables (1987), Carlito's Way (1993) and Mission: Impossible (1996) and Oliver Stone have seized upon the golden opportunity and redesigned this classic myth into a contemporary setting.This ultra violent portrayal of one mans rise from the Cuban Freedom Camps to the Ivory Towers of the drug Lords and their trappings is a testimony to the narcissistic accessories of the early eighties America and its self abuse and destructive need for cocaine. This is simply a tale of supply and demand and one mans vision on how he is going to supply this demand, no matter the consequences. An agonising and extremely brutal underworld that Brian De Palma has depicted with classy extremes in the killing fields of the streets of America.Both fast paced and hard hitting, this epic journey from skid row to the affluent excess's and the slow slip into the abyss of madness and paranoia is astounding. These are uncompromising and unforgiving times, and Oliver Stones views on these people are of contempt. This is shown in a very rendering scene where Elvira Hancock (Michelle Pfeiffer's character) and Tony Montana are having more than a discussion, at a restaurant table, about her womb being so polluted by drugs that she cannot give him the child he wants, and his own drug-filled ego getting the better of them both.It is in this climb to the top that we see more than what is being effected in his own life, that the style in which he has become accustomed can be more than infectious, and treacherous. It is his reconnection with his elderly mother and younger sister that has him seen as more than a dog of the streets but as a scorned son and much loved brother. Touching, maybe, but this is Tony Montana learning that when one has made his bed one has to learn to lie in it.And what a bed he has made, within its nineteen eighties throwbacks of style and music that the writings of Oliver Stone and Brian De Palmas delivery of excellent cinematography by John A. Alonzo (there are at least two wonderful panning shots, here, in Scarface that are just mesmerising, slow, deliberate and focused on its intent). Without question, this is Al Pacino's (b. 1940) greatest cinema achievement as the psychotic Montana whose American Dream slowly turns to nightmare and cold reality that his hell on earth is just as twisted as his hell in mind.'Scarface' aka Tony Montana is a fine example of the American Dream, his right and privilege to take hold and make best his ambition to escape the poverty and destitution of his past and make good his future. However, let this be a stark warning, that when one sleeps with dogs one will wake up with fleas, but with Tony Montana this flea was to bite him hard, fast and without pity.Scarface: Extremely violent, extremely explosive, extremely honest and additive and without doubt cinemas most extreme and updated stance on the world of the Gangster myth. Say hello to Tony Montana.",8,1,3,21 July 2007
Alien 3," Good Movies come in Thirds.
","I first saw Alien³ while in Berlin, as I travelled across Europe on my motorbike during the summer of '92. The newer version that has come to light several years later is a marked improvement, not to say that the 1992 Cinema release was a poorer effort, it was not, far from it.With a fine and prestige's English cast that refines and catapults this third instalment to a higher level of quality, such as Charles Dance, the late Brian Glover, Pete Postlethwaite and Paul McGann, Danny Webb and Philip Davis. We have also the charismatic Charles S. Dutton to represent the American market here too, as well as David Fincher, whose work as directing, besides Alien³ , on movies as, Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, but on the miniature and optical effects unit here only, and Se7en, The Game, Fight Club, and Panic Room.This fresher version extends the plight and solitude of the twenty or so remaining low life prisoners that have remained behind on their prison planet that is Fiorina 'Fury' 161, the Work Correctional Facility, and with Maximum Security status. There is no need for weapons, the CCTV has not worked in years, there is no supply of ice cream too, and with only one cargo visit per several months or so, the hope of escape and rescue is far and impossible.The characters here are given actual personalities, strong enough to work to a high degree of connection and understanding, and are hard not to sympathise with, toward the end of each, and eventual, demise. For they give off the sense of empathy and their esprit de corps is at least commendable, even for a collection of riffraff lifers.The acting is intelligent, clean, and sharp, at times humorous too, the love interest between Ripley and Clemens is a fine subplot. Alien³ concentrates more on the development of the human issue of the family of destitute's, rather than an out and out gore fest. There is blood and horror, but not on the level of this horror sci-fi genre has become synonymous.With its realistic language and sensitive overtones, Alien³ is a fine addition to the Alien saga if there ever was one.End of Transmission.",8,1,4,12 March 2006
The Incredible Hulk," No longer green behind the ears, but still some way to go.
","The green mean machine rises from the vaults of the Marvel collective once more. His true conception in 1962 has seen him more than often idolised in several aspects of the multimedia world, be it comics, cartoons, TV shows and just lately, as we see here, once more, a well-established movie star.Playing the beast with the flight or fight syndrome that is Dr. Bruce Banner's alter ego we have Edward Norton, who, also having a major role in the films script (as Edward Harrison), and with this input, we have what feels very much, and quite deliberately, like a pastiche of the 1970's TV show of the same name. With a nod to the late Bill Bixby (1934 - 1993) and the shows instantly recognisable theme tune here too. This classic TV show ran from 1978 until 1982, had 81 airings and we also see, in this movie, an identical transformation that is taken from the TV show, both inspiration and respect for this cult show are well apparent.We have the good Dr. on the run and trying his best to avoid capture, we see his love between Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) rekindled and the dastardly General Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross (William Hurt) trying his best to apprehend and detain the green giant. All done to perfection and predictability that will have young children loving the adventure and excitement that this formalistic narrative, bland but workable here, holds. While there is nothing wrong in formalistic story lines, it is well expected in this genre, and in its delivery is how it shall be judged.We are shown and drawn into the world in which this green fugitive lives: lonely, desperate, dangerous, cold and deadly. With this in mind, the Hulk has an equal: the Abomination (Tim Roth); hell on earth is soon to erupt. While the human world pulls through with its action sequences, seek and destroy battles, love lost and found, chastising and baiting, we are then introduced to the CGI world of the Hulk and his nasty foe. This green over-sized gamma infested beast has anger management written all over him; big, muscular, rippling and lifelike, not a bad interpretation of the jolly green giant, personally, I would have preferred the human touch, Lou Ferrigno, you are well missed. The blending of both worlds has its moments, but these are fleeting, but overall, it's more a case of ups than down, giving this movie an atmosphere of excitement that won't frighten the kids in the isles and will hold its own in a fight with the grown-ups too.The cast fairs well, but Ms. Tyler's soft and gentle character seems more fun when see is angry (the New York taxi scene for example), Tim Roth just seems slightly disjointed here, while William Hurt can be too easily forgotten when out of shot, but this is most definitely Mr. Norton's movie, without a doubt. Like most of Edward Norton roles they're not too over powering and not too undercooked, while this easy role has its moments, we can certainly understand that the real (hard) work has been done behind the camera.The Incredible Hulk will continue to prosper for Marvel if it heads in the direction that we see here. The kids will love the action and adventure while the grown ups will reflect on the nostalgia of it all and too enjoy the benefit of CGI, all that we can hope for is that too much of a formalistic direction won't turn this green colossus into pea green soup: we wait with baited breath.",2,7,17,13 June 2008
Resident Evil: Afterlife," A subject that moves forward but steps back in mind, body and soul.
","The problem I find with this fourth instalment of the Resident Evil franchise is that it seems to have by-passed any form of depth, while not expecting too much in the way of a story at least, this Afterlife addition has solely concentrated on its 3D gimmick to sell its point.There seems to be a trend of the visual over any hardcore narrative. What we have here is 3D overdrive enhancing the form and actions of Ms. Milla Jovovich, and it's as basic as that.The characters are the average one-dimensional throwaways that are placed on screen as walking clichés, adding too, that when it comes to any threat from this franchise's walking dead themselves they are no longer required to project tension or threat. These poor souls, too, no longer require top billing and it is they who are reliant on this latest technology rather than the 3-D needing the horror of the undead to keep the gravy train rolling.This, again, is not about the old days of walking dead horror but Alice's new image as 3D dolly bird and her quest to do slow-mo action and the old chestnut of bullet-time once again raises its ugly head. With this latest fad comes old ideas to exploit and it's all so tiring. All this and the nondescript script, too, that makes the fourth instalment a seemingly pointless exercise in the life of Alice and her wonderland. Her part in the franchise of the new technology of three-dimensional theatre is ever evident when the visual dimension supersedes the dimension of the three fundamental traits that make a good film: script, plot and narrative.",2,13,28,14 September 2010
Star Trek," The innovators' of science fiction would gasp in delight and astonishment.
","Star Trek is a thoroughly enjoyable science fiction flick brought to us by J.J. Abrams and crew, who is once more firmly in the directors' chair to revaluate and to reboot this classic television epic. It's first television airing, its Pilot, called The Cage, was Gene Roddenberry's (1921 - 1991) baby way back in the 1960s, repeats / reruns has cemented it to sci-fi cult status ever since.Here, we are shown what is the re-introduction of the young U. S. S. Enterprise crew and how their paths conjoin and interact for the first time, to become what they are and who they are. What this instalment has going for itself is longevity, longevity to continue as the new phase, the new and bold frontier to perpetuate its myth and vitality. Star Trek has truly arrived in the 21st Century. And what an entrance.While at the fork in the road, the point being, here, you do not have to be a follower of the Star Trek franchise to enjoy this feature film, taking it as the next step in its evolution or taking it independently as a splendid sci-fi movie, or in fact, both, is the appeal of this fresh and epic journey. As a 'Star Trek' film its green-shoots, in time, will, no doubt, develop into what we have become accustomed to, or shall it? Does it need to? Shall we see the old characteristics coming to maturity? Or, shall we see a completely new direction to these space adventurers'? Time and space will be the better judge to these begging questions, but travelling down the second road, of a film of the science fiction genre, it is riveting stuff, and it is exactly what the Big Screen was created for.Visually, it is extremely captivating and exciting movie watching. The tone is both friendly, humorous, fun and intriguing, a curiosity in which direction the roads shall take, but, deep down, we all know the outcome, as it is quick with pace as it is a stunning work of visual delight and excellence. Maximum science fiction eye candy that transcends both franchise and audience to greater expectations without a fault in its delivery or character analyses. This is action over philosophical thought, grunt over intellect, this is 21st century action hero space travel.We, or more to the point, film and cinema, have come a long way since the old exploration days of Georges Méliès's Le voyage dans la lune (A Trip to the Moon - 1902) and René Clair's Paris qui dort (At 3:25 - 1925). We are grateful to these innovators' of both film and science fiction, and too, to the great 1956 epic Forbidden Planet, all who have helped mould and create the shape of things that have come and what shall be. As too, it is J.J. Abrams's step into the unknown that is the 21st century Star Trek that too takes a bow and for this bold attempt and right step forward to continue at the helm of, possibly, the most famous spacecraft in science fiction history.",7,1,10,22 May 2009
Monster," Crimson and Clover.
","The tag line dictates: Based on a true story. The small print at the end of this movie states something similar to this: While the movie is inspired by real events in A. Wuornos life, many characters are composites or inventions and a number of incidents in this film are fictional. Other than A.Wuornos, any similarity to any person is not intended and purely coincidental. When going to the cinema, it's interesting seeing a film and not, at times, knowing anything about a movie, who is starring, its story line etc. We chose Monster. We chose right.As the ending credit's rolled up, we just sat there stunned. What an intense movie. Extremely well shot, I can't say this enough. With a great musical soundtrack that complements each scene as the character's come to a crossroads in their lives. Written and Directed by Patty Jenkins, who has done an excellent job at bringing the sordid life of Aileen Wuornos, the unhappy victim of life's underclass, to the Big Screen. This film is brought together by a great team that star's Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci. This self-pitying and self-destructive life of an uneducated working class woman who turns to prostitution as a form to earn money, who not only blames society for her position in life but is finally prepared to murder for the better life that she has always longed for. On the run with her very naive young lover, Selby Wall. Who is placing too many demands for the better life that unbeknown to her is a price too high. Finally, when the bubble bursts it is far too late to turn back, it is time to face their demons and ironically for the first time, for Wuornos be responsible for their actions and to grow up. How much of this movie is true and factual I don't know, but as a movie that brings the emotions of loneliness, love, passion, anger, hate, friendship and hope together then it has succeed in every way possible. Ms. Jenkins has done a great job in bringing the audience close to a woman who should be despised for her grudges and self-pity, we should not condone the killings and the poor victims and their families who are the only victims of this very sad individual. But as we all, as Human Beings, deserve life, love, happiness and respect, then there is a very tiny amount of empathy. Who has not suffered similar situations as Wuornos, not in these extremes, but life cannot be judged by false hopes that turn into grudges that you are willing to murder. She was wrong to murder but so very right about the real side of Human Nature, that also, ironically, she played a big part in herself. This movie is a fantastic piece of work, through the writing, direction and the back up of a good crew. It rightly deserves the recognition of the Oscar. Well done to one and all.",9,0,0,3 November 2005
Alien: Resurrection," Come Fourth and Show Yourself.
","Alien Resurrection here is the fourth movie of the Alien epics, the directional duties are given to Frenchman Jean-Pierre Jeunet. As usual, the writing credits go to Dan O'Bannon, Ronald Shusett, and Joss Whedon.Alien Resurrection has a unique blend of individuality, contrast and occasionally containing an analogous trait, where as with the first three movies, which binds in with each other as conjoined triplets, Alien Resurrection breaks free to hold its own pace and style of what is the Alien mould. The concept of Alien Resurrection is not all together unique by any means, but the delivery is done brilliantly and all with the right amount of flair, action, tension and suspense, which are all very good ingredients for any Horror Sci-Fi, the overall effect is a superb conjunction of Sci-Fi and Horror mythology.Using set designs as impressive as these, though a little trite, they do their job well, with the help of Iranian born Darius Khondji as Cinematographer, having also worked with Jean-Pierre Jeunet on Delicatessen, 1991, they have combined their talents to bring a very dark and interesting atmosphere.The panoramic shots of space, and the ships that glide motionless passed our eyes, are done to an impeccable visual detail, this segues the action shots to the scenic views in an artistic manner that is now the high standard of this movie genre.Having physiological mind games played against one another, with the upward spiral of fear and paranoia, the trapped captives and their impending attack from the eleven Alien creatures is done to a fashion that is more than adequate to place any self-respecting Horror Sci-Fi movie as this, in a category of high ranking and World-Class status.",6,0,1,11 March 2006
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Hey, why? Eh!
","Forgiving, for a moment, that this is Mr. Nicholas Stoller's first attempt at directing, we can say, with all honesty, that this attempt is also as easily forgettable. With Jason Segel who on par with Vince Vaughn as to total charisma by-pass, this laid out road map of a movie is at least amusing to the extremes of bewilderment as to ask what was the point? Set in the lush location of Hawaii, this beautiful island is more looking like the flotsam and jetsam of bad scripts, limited efforts' and a weak plot to the point of sheer tedium. There is a level of predictability in, certain, movies that when having crossed a certain level, usually the lowest, then turns any movie into outright worthlessness, Forgetting Sarah Marshall falls snugly into this description, too. Predictability, here, is the name of the game, added with the dull, and more than often, painful dialogue, this all to obvious direction throughout is seen as lazy or just plain unimaginative. With little attempt to convey any higher ground of thought to the narrative, this stance leaves nothing but an open road with no turns, twists, slip roads and bends to excite and planning this journey can be so easily done with ones eyes closed, such is the obvious horizons' that this film projects.Then, apart from the shady editing, being choppy at best, in other places very poor, in particular during the conversation between Aldous Snow and Matthew the Waiter and the demo disc. There is too the gags; simple, cold and listless, with comedy it needs a character, a character with persona, wit and timing, this lifeless, dull and time wasting exercise deals no punches and only solidifies itself in a similar vain to a petrified forest. The only redeeming artifice here is the wit of one Russell Brand, who seems to have the best lines here too, and with this self loving man of free love, and too, the newly-weds of desperation, is the films only real redemption. It really is a pity that this characterisation was not carried off to other members of the cast, otherwise, this may have faired well in the road to recovery, instead it is well worth remembering that it only takes a slight wrong turn and very quickly ends up looking like road kill.",2,18,41,25 April 2008
Hostel," Been Inn this building before.
","This Comment will contain Spoilers. Please take heed, thank's, and don't feel too cut up about it.What a load of old rubbish.After all the media hype, that I never fell for, for a minute, did you? No, I did not go to this showing to see just gore, as Hostel sold itself on, but to see a new and refreshing movie of interest at least.This completely unoriginal and extremely predictable bore fest has been seen too many times before, i.e. the oozing eye from the Japanese girl, this being the money shot no doubt, such as in The Evil Dead. Come on, could there not be any other way for this movie to develop, to evolve? Yeah, kids on the journey of their lifetime, fair enough, but it approached a brick wall and never turned into anything but a pointless sorry excuse of celluloid.Who, or what even, is this movie aimed at? What was the story again? (It's a rhetorical question), do me a favour and come back with something with an idea and content that is worthy of my time and money. At least we know there won't, I hope, be a squeal, as all the lose ends were so very conveniently tied up at the end, wow, now that was easy wasn't it? I'm impressed.Even to the point of seeing a girl with only one eye, the other was on the floor you see, she seemed to take it very well, you know, in the car, getting away from the baddies, see was ever so quiet and calm. The question of how high was her pain threshold was for her to be able to walk around with half her face ripped open and not be screaming her, excuse the pun, face off, and yes, you've guessed it, she helps the good guy in the end by. Amazing. It's not that hard to figure out.Even in the torture scenes, we are, more than often, only guessing at what is being done to the poor victims. As these were out of shot, please don't say, ' Well less is more and we had to image what was being done to them for better effect', I just thought that it was because this movie lacked, another pun, guts, guts to carry off what the media hype had us, except me, and yourself? To believe.This Hostel was full; there was simply no more room at this Inn. Unfortunately, there were no more rooms to let to creativity, imagination, plot and originality.I'm looking for another building (story) plot.I'm checking out.",1,2,4,2 April 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," A Childs Feast of Imagination.
","This wonderful movie will do for the Children of today what Star Wars did for a whole generation of kids back in the 70's. If you're an Adult, then Narnia could disappoint. Primarily a Children's movie, this is not to be forgotten, that the story is based on the Children's classic: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe, taken from the series of books The Chronicles of Narnia by C. S. Lewis.Transcending a storyline from a children's book into film doesn't seem that hard a task, concerning Narnia. Grown ups will love it all the same, but Children will be Astounded by it. The Magical Land that is Narnia will have them riveted to their seats in a Spellbound Wonder. Imaginations will be set lose and the desire of involvement shall be justifiably Magical. On leaving the cinema, my wife and I, thought it a very good movie. The only negative criticism was that to the end of the movie, it was just a movie for Children, which we expected and knew. This is no Lord of the Rings by any means. Standing proudly on it's own two feet, this very easy plot and what seems to be very simple character development is all to familiar with Children's adaptation's. For us, the movie started to wane a little after the crossing of the iced river. The introduction of the characters, along with Lucy and her Kin was done very well, practically the humour of the Beavers, where have I seen 'that' relationship before? Very funny, and will Children understand it, I wonder. They will, eventually. This is our point, after the snow had settled there was hardly any kind of stimulation, for us anyway. It continued onward on one level, even the battle scene was fair but harmless. I would not expect a bloody feast, as I have said before this is no Tolkien. This movie brings Children to the Fantasy and Magical Splendour that is C.S. Lewis. Both very Individual in their own right and both with exceptionally Intelligent writing Minds. The young actress Georgie Henley was truly amazing, where did they find her? Please don't say Ilkley, West Yorkshire, England. It's a rhetorical question. Another Child star to look out for, as with other Child Actresses of her age, such as Shirley Temple, Dakota Fanning and the then young lady born in Jerusalem, Israel, Natalie Portman for example. Well-done young Lady. I hope that this movie will delight and entertain the young and the new generation of Cinema-goers, to be kick started by a movie that is visually captivating will be a memory to behold. You have to start somewhere, for me it was Star Wars. So lets hope that C.S. Lewis's work on the Big Screen will stir their growing imaginations, as his books will always do.",6,0,0,14 December 2005
Public Enemies," There, but not quite at The Top.
","Here we have the criminal class and their underworld exploits that has been cast into the public arena since the heady days of Al Capone's St. Valentine's Day massacre. Media lead and sectionalised for maximum effect, these modern-day outlaw cowboys' were the new antihero's that the victims of the great American depression, Americas bleakest time and her at her most naked and vulnerable, needed and craved.It was Warner Bros. and one Edward G. Robinson in Little Caesar (1931) that opened the floodgate to a new genre of film: the gangster movie. Built over the years in categories' such as 'classic' (The Public Enemy), 'social background' (Angels With Dirty Faces), 'film noir' (The Maltase Falcon), and the 'historical reconstruction' etc, etc. It is now well and truly above reproach to say that it has earned its right into the film history vaults. Public Enemies has the historical reconstruction label put upon it, and this latest outing has John Dillinger facing the music. Played by Johnny Depp with cool persona, who does quite a good job in leaving the viewer feeling a little too distant and unattached. Unlike his counterparts, Cagney and Robinson, for example, from the classic period, who oozed psychotic menace, has this modern day Dillinger looking more sedate and, at times, a sympathetic character. This is a man who, by reputation and vocation, was a bank robbing killer, here, Michael Mann has concentrated on the love angle between Dillinger and Billie Frechette, played by French beau ideal Marion Cotillard (La vie en rose - 2007). John Dillinger was an evil man, but this feels that the epicentre of his crime wave has been by-passed by a love angle. Yes, we know that every good gangster needs a gangster's moll: Clyde's Bonnie, Tony Montana's Elvira Hancock and Tom Powers' Gwen Allen to name a few, while the work was being done these leading ladies were sidelined, this, Mr. Mann's Public Enemies feels more Kit and Holly's Badlands of 1973. The sets are fine and the outfits, well, Oscar buzz anyone? The category 'Costume Design' would be missing a very sharp cut if this film's Colleen Atwood were not nominated; on the other hand, it is the actual feel of lack of depth and lack of connection from the major players here, insofar the lack of detail that is given, only a smattering of information of peoples' past is ever present. This, and at other points in the movie really does feel like a pure reconstruction, akin to Televisions crime programmes, than a piece of work based on the life of John Dillinger and his nemeses Melvin Purvis. This is where this work falls flat, yes, there is atmosphere, tension and interest but the 'historical reconstruction' label feels like it is skimming the pages of a book rather than sitting down and reading the whole thing proper.It really is a crime, and to be blunt, if there were ever a film that came across as deep in narrative, tense in action, sincere at heart then, for I, it has to be Terrence Malick's Badlands. Any gangster movie, too, that contains James Cagney: The Public Enemy (1931), The Roaring Twenties (1939) and White Heat (1949) and of course Howard Hawks' masterpiece Scarface (1932). Mr. Dillinger here certainly is on top of his world but he will never reach Top of the World!",4,0,3,6 July 2009
Pirate Radio," It tried, but I didn't get no satisfaction.
","In the heart of '60's swinging England there was Pirate Radio, while not a new idea altogether, in this fresh, vibrant decade which catered for the youth market and together, with the pop culture, pop art and Rock n' Roll, there simply had to be an outlet for its audiences' music. There was simply nothing else providing the youth market, via the concept of Medium Wave, the sounds that this upwardly mobile youth culture begged.Of course, there were the likes of televisions Top of The Pops (1964 - 2006, BBC owned) and Ready Steady Go! (1963 - 1966), but the radio market had yet to be conquered by big business. This first came in the shape and form of Pirate Radio. We still see today the new age of Pirate Radio, which is land based and more urban and underground, this still has not stopped the authorities' trying their best to extinguish the flame of 'free radio' in the name of, well, themselves. You see, one major problem that 'free radio' proposes is that it 'steals' airwave space and this costs, in form of lost revenue.Today, we have the British film The Boat That Rocked, the fictitious account of a group of Disc Jockeys', playing 24-hour music off the shores of England. In addition, we have the British Government that tries to thwart their free radio spirit, by simply basing their argument, after extensive research, by the aptly named Government Official Twatt, that a small fishing boats crew 'nearly drowned' because Radio Rock's signal had, unintentionally, interfered with the fishing crews signal for help.What director, writer and producer Richard Curtis (Four Weddings and a Funeral, 1994, The Black Adder and Mr. Bean, T. V. comedy series) has done here is given us a film that seems to have been pulled from a magician's hat. What we should be seeing is the white rabbit; sadly, we have a white elephant out of the hat, this feels more contrived and rigid, the cast be may be ensemble like, no egos here, but it is the poor assembly of an even poorer execution of script and depth. In equal measure, cast and crew have manned the lifeboats and set sail to a land of few-and-far-between gags, wit, and imagination.With this cast, excluding Kenneth Branagh who shines, and out shines, as the ultra stiff Minister Dormandy, so much more could have be achieved for and by Nick Frost, Rhys Ifans and Philip Seymour Hoffman. While doing what they do best for Queen and Country, it all feels rather too clichéd, too animated and, again, very contrived. This is ever so obvious in the character Quentin, played by Bill Nighy, who 'was' this character meant to be, was he 'supposed' to this rigid or was this simply Mr. Nighy trying his best to be bad? This is more than just stereotyping for its own sake, this is underdeveloped characters who have less personalities that the vinyl that is been played on their turntables. In all, this is stretched out television comedy, and all that is missing, like Richard Curtis's 'Mr. Bean', is the canned laughter.With a running time of some two hours, there must have been some scope for direction and instead we have an armada of a sinking script and personality, which concentrates on a shallow epicentre of nothing more than a tiny group of hedonistic middle-aged men yarning for the jailbait that worships their every whim.The Boat That Rocked does, on the other side of the disc, portray a healthy and positive message of rebellion, comradeship and vitality of life. A charming scene here is when one of the young men finds his heart broken and the 'tea and biscuits' offered by two of his friends is done magnificently and is pure magic and the rallying behind the newly married member whose heart is, too, broken is commendable and it's all proof-positive and fun.While having an interesting soundtrack; The Who, The Kinks, The Rolling Stones, The Beach Boys, Moody Blues, Jimi Hendrix, Cat Stevens, and others, to keep the mood perpetual, it all seems wasted when backed up by this stereotyping. Playing the music for the music's sake, keeping it alive for a generation frustrated by the lack of play other than the ships weighing anchor off shore. They love their life, they love their friends and they love Rock n' Roll. Mr. Curtis has given these guys direction, direction in their goals, but, sadly, Mr. Curtis has lost them in a thinly veiled adaptation of television sitcom, in the nautical sense, doldrums.",2,7,16,28 April 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," A sheep in wolverine clothing.
","It's like duck season but with the valued and much appreciated paying public well and truly in the franchise players' sights, their souls and wallets are easy targets when it comes to mush such as this. Vulnerable minds, indifferent attitudes taking the bait; as long as the target audience lays itself across these impending railway lines, whom can we blame but ourselves, if this adaptable chameleonic gravy train rolls headfirst into success and prosperity? X-Men Origins: Wolverine sells itself off the back of the X-Men brand, this tiny, inferior drop-off is just dreadful; we have become adjusted to the cogs-in-the-machine that is unoriginality in motion, clichÃ©d in progress and dull to the very core of its roots. The cogs that are drip-fed easy money back into its veins to resurrect the perpetual monotony of this fugue state as we leave the cinema hallways.Easily lead to the slaughter, we sit and hope that there shall be redemption in texture, salvation in style and creativity in content, but alas, the Well has run dry and only dust and decay reside in these hollowed halls of the Hollywood machine, but, on the up-front, padded-out with the adage of; another day, another dollar. This is what you get for your Yen, Pound and Dollar. This is no bad policy in itself but at the expense of what in particular? This then gives us a choice, an experience to know the difference and having the means to make that difference.The distant chimes of future spin-off's, with this particular brand of X-Men and their comrades' that is, are always ringing in our ears. Heading toward the proper direction, the correct amount of spin and heaps of hype, all looks well and healthy in the Hollywood camp, but is it the same-old-same-old reprise? Only we, with out ticket stub in hand, or in future, not as the case may be, shall be our only weapon that will be the spanner thrown in the works of this monocultural industry.",1,1,6,30 June 2009
Spider-Man 3," A long web that finally breaks its ties: Children will love it.
","With Sam Raimi's third and final Spider-Man instalment now going strong and selling out Cinema seats quicker than bug repellent at a cockroach convention, this is one off those Summer Block Busters' that shouldn't be missed.While in every story there is always a beginning, middle and an end, Spider-Man 3 is most definitely the conclusion of this 3-piece saga. A saga that has its roots set in the first two movies, given the opening credits as a gentle reminder.Spider-Man 3 is a two-act adventure, the first being a reintroduction to our friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man and the loves of his life, and also the introduction to his newly acquired enemies such as the New Goblin, Sandman and the toothy Venom.This first stage of the movie is a somewhat drawn-out affair that more or less tells us what we have already gathered during the first two previous instalments, while it neither progresses the relationships further but it only baits it with false promise and empty smiles.This, is where Spider-Man 3 can become rather tied up in itself, a story that only centres around, and mostly around its three protagonists, this is a movie that has little distraction over the main three-way love tangle. Everything else is a diversion of the up and coming conclusion toward the ends reality bite and heartbreak.The bad guys and their relative space here in this movie are more or less not as important as the three main lovebirds and their entwining and volatile relationship. With the help of Messrs New Goblin, Sandman, Venom and a little black substance from the far-flung reaches of space, we are very much aware of the on going love-hate scenario that in its own pace delivers the build up to it second act; the action.After the initial prologue, the second act then kicks in and the action is then thrown upon us, albeit in its usual mêlée. An action movie that young children will be left in awe and delight. With more bad guys than a spider has legs, this is Spider-Man fighting to the end with all he has. With better cgi this time as compared to the poorer Spider-Man movie of 2002 the lessons have been learnt. With an exciting finale that befits this masked crusader and has the young audience rooting for the spidery superhero and cheering all the right swings and punches.A great movie for the kid's and a cinema experience that they will cherish for years to come, this is Superhero extreme, a marvel that will carry them onto new adventures and new land's. Spider-Man 3 is a fond farewell and at the same time the grand opening to fresh Heroes and exotic wonderment.",4,2,2,7 May 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," Magnificent and beautiful movie making.
","'Suffer the little children at the hand's of evil men'.Ofelia's love of fairy tales is obvious from the beginning of Mexican born Guillermo Del Toro's 2006 movie El Laberinto del fauno. Set in the not so tranquil woodlands during the Spanish Civil War of July 17th 1936 to April 1st 1939 , where a small but dedicated band of anti-fascism rebels are hiding out, this is where Ofelia and her pregnant mother have come to live, in the company of Capitán Vidal, Ofelia's new stepfather and soon to be father of her half-brother. It is with the brutal, unforgiving and totalitarian idealist Capitán Vidal, and his fascist troops, who must weed out these resistance fighters of the hills and woods, that Ofelia finds her release and distraction of the new world order and its warring factions and delves into the older, mysterious and enchanting world of fairies, faun's and giant frogs.El Laberinto del fauno is intertwined with several stories, and each carrying their own with sufficient character and strength for the movie not to warrant sub-plots. The delivery of these plots are well matched and paced to lift El Laberinto del fauno into the realms of a magnificent story of love, death, bravery and fairy tale magic.It is in the eyes of young Ofelia that we see her world around her becoming more intriguing with each passing day, her journey into the labyrinth and the cold reality around her pushing her deeper and deeper into a world of innocence.Then, it is in this contradiction as to why El Laberinto del fauno works its own magic so well, El Laberinto del fauno is a dark and evil place to reside, not only the twisted and tangled roots and branches of Ofelia's newfound world, but also, the perils of war. The darker side of human nature is shown without pity or remorse, death is always close by, and for the eyes of a child, only dreams can overpower the nightmares of this horrific, often graphic and extremely uncompromising grown-up world.Sometimes tense, sometimes sentimental, sometimes astounding but always magnificent in the delicate handling's of this young child's world, this too is the world of how we deal with war and those who suffer it, literally.With beautiful set designs, imaginative artwork and crafted edits and a story that holds no compassion for War, El Laberinto del fauno is a charming period piece that goes far beyond the dreams of a child. El Laberinto del fauno is also, at best, a reminder of how, as human beings, we can become so narrow minded in our beliefs that we forget to remind ourselves that this world is more than just ideas and hidden agendas but that we must transcend ourselves into a higher plain of understanding, tolerance and respect for one another. It is this philosophy that makes us different from the rest, as human beings we have always had this right to choose.",9,2,5,3 July 2007
Alien," The One to Aspire too.
","The 1970's were a dead decade, where it concerned the Science-Fiction cum Horror movie genre; we did have Sci-Fi movies that entertained as such, like 1968's 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Planet of the Apes franchise that started in '68 and continued well into the '70s. Then there was the heart warming Eco' friendly Silent Running from 1972. The year of the Science-Fiction movie and its quantum leap into mass subconscious was 1977, and the crossover movie of Star Wars. It was going to be the movie that now put Sci-Fi back on the moviegoers and makers map. Apart from Star Wars of course, other movies did their jobs respectively well, but in comparison, felt a little lukewarm and were not too taxing altogether as sci-fi movies. As for horror, we had the battle for Good and Evil that was the 1973 classic The Exorcist, and 1974 had us running for cover from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. All this was well and good, but this was until Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett came along, with an interesting new idea that in the end, no one was too bothered to play with. In fact, the only reason Alien got the green light was simply, and literally, that it was the nearest script on the table of a major 20th Century Fox money-man. They were so desperate to keep this new cash-cow of the Sci-Fi ball rolling, in the wake that was Star Wars, they said okay, it was quite simply, in the right place at the right time, and the rest is history. Having the then newly British director Ridley Scott, his only role of directorship was two years hence, with The Duellists, perform the part was a very fortunate choice indeed. With an eye for microscopic detail, his perfectionist attitude toward realism and the grandiose of the Alien World around him, he and his team, has created one of the most astonishing and completely original sets seen in Sci-Fi Horror. The internals of the seven space truckers' ship, the Nostromo, has such fine and well structured detail that it is so very hard to remember that it is a life size model. This detailed work had never been seen on a grand scale as this, maybe it had with Star Wars and Space Odyssey, in a fashion, but not, remember, in a Sci-Fi Horror movie, this was setting the standards for future movies to aspire too, Alien was to open up a completely new genre itself. Where as the Nostromo is minute and precise in detail, the planet in which the unlucky seven encounter, and particularly the alien spacecraft that unwittingly draws them in, is off immense size. To behold on the Silver Screen, with amazing perfection too, on this design, Alien not only draws you in, it also gives you, within a change of a single frame, a sharp in take of breath. Visually powerful stuff. Alien starts of with a deliberately slow and meaningful character build up that draws us to each personality, in fact, we do not see anything of the Alien until the first hour of this movie. To witness their environment and the life that they have to endure while travelling across space has been done with a pace that delivers us a group of characters that we feel we have known for an age. We have to know who these unfortunate soles are; there is no rush here, for all individuals introduce themselves well enough for us to feel for their loss. Alien turns full circle as the threat becomes more apparent, as each crew-member is slaughtered, the pace then becomes more frantic and chaotic. With the build up off visual suspense and the delivery of an atmosphere of extreme fear, Alien is on the point of no return, your anxiety has no where to channel itself, you too are on the roller coaster ride of fear that Alien has brought you. You have seen nothing like this before, you're in shock, and if you survive the ride, you may not want to again.Or just maybe",9,1,3,12 March 2006
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," A cut above the rest. A cut across the neck. That's something to sing about!
","Gone are the old days of the Musical, with classics such as Oliver! (1968), Paint Your Wagon (1969) and Grease (1978), and we may have even said 'Those were the days', well, I'm happy to say that they are now back; with a vengeance.Yeah, maybe a Disney cartoon musical may keep popping up every couple of years, or even a High School Musical, but this is down to basics and now the good old, the grand opera days of the Musical, and with the help of movie director Tim Burton, is, once again, finding its voice.Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street's modern adaptation can go back to the early 1970's with English playwright Christopher Bond and his own unique brand of Victorian barbarism. It was to be Stephen Sondheim who then turned this Gothic legend into musical myth.Tim Burton may have his leading man strapped to the chair once more; this being their seventh collaboration together, but it is definitely the sinister and bitter Benjamin Barker alias Sweeney Todd who steals the limelight here. Wronged and robbed of his love and life by Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) we see his return some years later to take back what was once lost and to seek solace in the plans of avenger and angel of death. Albeit with a little help from his friends; friends of the smooth, sharp and silvery kind.Lost and soulless in a too familiar town, London town, his return and his chance meeting with Mrs. Lovett, self proclaimed as the worse pie maker in all of London, this partnership of retribution and love is the devils play and the devils own making.The scene is set and the die is cast for the dramatic duo to play their respective parts, and with a cutthroat razor in one hand and a rolling-pin in the other and a song to sing. Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is on its way to becoming the darkest, bloodiest, horrific and sinister sing-a-longs that has ever hit our cinema screens. Oh we've seen the like of The Little Shop of Horrors (1960), The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) and the Japanese cult classic Katakuri-ke no kôfuku (The Happiness of the Katakuris, 2001), all playing the murder rap, as stage plays or whatnot's then turned into film musicals, and this latest edition is no exception. But this is exactly what it pronounces, one doesn't hold a set of cut throat razors just to show off ones collection of silverware, here we see them used to full extravagance and malicious brutality, this musical, this movie, of the avenging demon is up close and very personal. There are no misconceptions: it's very sharp and it's unforgiving in the dealings of this grotesque and focused plan of action. Nothing is missed. Nothing is hidden. Nothing in what is seems when you enter the Barber of Fleet Street's establishment. You've been warned.The narrative of song is superb, set with Tim Burton's trademark of the surreal and the dark and mysterious. We see a London in its down trodden glory of this Victorian age that once consisted of Jack the Ripper, Charles Darwin's book On the Origin of Species and the possibility of one Sweeny Todd; Man, myth or legend, whatever be the truth, it is in this film that we see, and hear, some great compositions. The storyline is given its sinister overtone with titles as 'No Place Like London', 'The Worst Pies In London', 'My Friends', 'A Little Priest' and 'Not While I'm Around' to whet our palate and when the music stops let the turmoil of madness ring their Bow bells proper.Not done to the extremes of the 1968 Oliver! where we see the streets burst into song and dance, this is a rendition of two very twisted souls and their dialogue that is sung, and spoken, to propel the dark forces of the malice content. Charming but at the same time very disturbing to hear words sung in the lines of 'My Friends', those silver plated friends, and the work they shall do when slicing the necks of those most deserving, or as the case of 'A Little Priest' undeserving. Often is the case with actor-turned-singer Mr. Depp does his best and with the right atmospehre and proper training pulls it off with his own blend of style and charisma. It could be worse; at least he wasn't painting his wagon whilst being born under a 'Wand'rin' Star'. Ouch!With a cast such as Timothy Spall OBE (Officer of the Order of British Empire), strangely again playing a Cads heavy-man, and Alan Rickman and the simply delightful Helena Bonham Carter all playing their parts, and singing them too, with individual merit and prowess. This is a film that takes on the norm and has done itself proud to have turned a Stage Play into a highly recognisable art form such as the Movie Musical, daring and challenging to the same-old-same-old's out there, then again, if it wasn't it wouldn't be a Tim Burton movie, would it? You know what to expect, if you don't, then who knows, it may have been a very close shave",8,0,0,5 February 2008
Suicide Squad," A soul nearly condemned to death.
","What can we say about the latest summer blockbuster of 2016 that is Suicide Squad? Alternatively, more to the point, what positive observations can be said of this extremely hyped and over-sold movie? Well, not a lot apparently. This is not a writers' concern here, meaning that what we see here on Screen from this particular genre is to be expected, and it really is not too heavy to digest nor is it surprising and innovative. No, what we have here is a visual bombastic overload; too over-produced and too much going-on to make any smooth and even sensibility. The whole escapade begs too many questions as to point out that the graphics, in part also, the visual narrative and its projection, are simply too messy that, in turn, only deprives the viewer from any pleasure it tries to convey. This then, sadly, turns the final feel and mood of the whole experience into a what-could-have-been to shame-about-that and resets the tone from hyped monster to nothing more than a Dirty Dozen retrospective with migraine inducing illustration. The premise is a simple affair that really does not hold too much weight for character development and only gives us a skimming of background development to just keep the level of interest in motion, typical of this genre. The overuse of Rock and Pop tracks are poorly placed and badly timed to the point of distraction and is extremely irrelevant in areas that really do not hold contention. Where this may have been an interesting guise, at least, and in some part it just pulls it off. Overall there is soundtrack saturation to only bug and bore the viewer insofar that it seems that this tact not only tries to explain the narrative further it seems, at worst, to patronise the viewer as to make them seem incapable as to fully understand the narrative without an extra source. On the positive, there are some moments that are worthy of merit, and this is seeing Mr. Smith enter this genre, and making a good show too boot, there seems to be a close level playing field with egos that does not tarnish this project. With the Poster Girl for this movie is the eye-catching Margot Robbie that add both glamour and humour to set the mood and the spine-chilling Viola Davis that brings a grimly posture to the proceedings which each carries the film onward and upward. It is not a too bad a movie, and it really will be seen once more, but what does let it down is that the graphics', and soundtrack, within certain areas, are trying too hard, too quickly and too vigorously.",3,0,1,14 August 2016
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A puncture wound that deflates any resemblance of hope.
","An empty shell of an experience that flows into, and through, a universe of its old style of plagiarism bringing a low echelon of excitement and without great direction of plot and script. There is nothing refreshing and impelling to bring the viewer to a captivating thrill. Fresh out of the box as Richard E. Grant (General Pryde) and Dominic Monaghan (Beaumont), and some, too, tried & tested stalwarts of past vigour's, exhume eye-watering inadequacy in extended persona or charisma and only divide a myth into a mirth of poor casting.The shebang is topsy-turvy with new faces that don't gel and old players and creatures being regurgitated with the likes of Billy Dee Williams (Lando Calrissian), Harrison Ford (Han Solo) and Ian McDiarmid (Emperor Palpatine) to hold the fort of a bygone era and to perpetuate the legend of Hope. The addition of Olde world players only condenses any credibility to bring a slight wave of nausea that should have really have been left to the past in the, once again, bygone era where integrity and respect still hold. This feels too misplaced and the rejuvenation of past character's only weathers the experience to a cringe worthy bemusement that concludes the proceedings of crossing the 'T's' and doting the 'I's'.The relationship of the leading lady of light and her dark nemeses (and within each oozes volumes of personality, charisma and intrigue between them, their personality, albeit from both sides of the screen, are a credit to the Star Wars saga) brings, now, only an entourage of stale narrative and lacklustre performance of once romantic and visionary heights; its all too short a conclusion within the stretch of timeframe within this latest chapter; this thin-on-the-ground finalÃ© that, it feels pushed and condensed to only befit this last phase of the two opposing opposites.With the lack of wiz-bang set against the best of CGI, there is a deep contradiction that has hastily crept in this ninth episode, while visually stunning, we seem to have been fed a bland adventure, and the rotten apple at the bottom of this barrel, that is most certainly, and importantly, the final adventure. This entire ninth, and excluding the final two previous epic exploits, just feel tired, flat and punctured. Sadly, the epigraph, the writing on the wall, will, here, be always engraved as the film that not only lost its voice, but misplaced its tour de Force.",3,8,14,25 December 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," A tale of opposite sides of the spectrum; joyful & menacing.
","You've bought the t-shirt. You've bought the album. You've bought the concert ticket. Now you can buy the film. This skimming the surface of the interpretation of this English band through this latest medium goes through the simplistic motions of a well written book; it has a beginning. A middle. And an end. But here, Bohemian Rhapsody contains all three aspects of the qualities of a well written book, too, but in its final execution it lacks true depth, true insight and true understanding of exactly how this band lived and survived within the harsh realities of the music industry itself. No secrets here.Queen disbanded after their final performance together on the 9th of August 1986 (Knebworth Park, England) and officially after the sad death of their charismatic, extrovert lead singer Freddie Mercury, birth name Farrokh Bulsara (5th September 1946 - Sultanate of Zanzibar: 24 November 1991 - London, England) to HIV AIDS. Bohemian Rhapsody, with good intentions, is a fantastic film, the operative word here being 'fan'. The concern with biopics is that they can tend to be simply that, a fan-based narrative to straightforwardly not engage the pros & cons of the whatnots of said artists' but to entertain and, more importantly, to perpetuate the image, the myth, the legend and the coffers of those involved; If you make it, they will buy it. All well and good, to a point, if you understand the difference of entertainment and education; the difference between biopic and documentary.'Bohemian Rhapsody', written by Mr. Mercury, for the 1975 album 'A Night at the Opera', is more than simply a track on a 70s rock album, its significance, its impact, its relevance, both musically and culturally, has connotations way beyond its six minutes of diversity and complexity, and here, with the work of Mr. Singer, has extended the image, the myth, the legend. This amusing fable, this sad tale, this exposÃ© of a casualty of abundance delves into the murky waters of human relationships; betrayal, jealousy, anger, self-worth, identity, loneliness and ego.
This is not the story of one band, this is, first & foremost, the story of its frontman, Freddie Mercury. We are to witness a fleeting glimpse, and feel, once more, a connection beyond the passing of this public figure, an empathy to his course, an empathy because of his course, like so many of his kindred spirits. We delve into his struggle with his proud parents, his bisexuality, his homosexuality, his working, and departure, within the band and ultimately his love, his soulmate, for Mary Austin (b. 1951).Bohemian Rhapsody certainly shows the sordid side of how people can become lost, not only within themselves, but as human beings, but there is also hope, reconciliation and family too that are projected along the narrative here, sending a message that amongst all that is rotten there is always love & family. This is an intriguing retrospective of contradictions interwind with both joy and tragedy of a time when four men came together and became not only kings of their profession, but an inspiration fit for a Queen.",9,0,0,20 August 2019
28 Weeks Later," Later has arrived. Run, run, run...
","The only reason Hitler didn't invade England during World War II is because he couldn't , England being an Island, and with the sea's as barrier he just couldn't take his prize. It is in this paradox that a deadly rage virus that has contaminated the British Isles has been contained from reaching the outside world. It is in this theme that we now find in this extended movie of Danny Boyle's 2002 movie 28 Days Later the virus gone and a slow repatriation of its people back to the British Isles.28 Weeks Later stars one of the most charismatic actors to come from the Scottish Highlands; Robert Carlyle, whose works range from Once Upon a Time in the Midlands (2002), The Full Monty (1997) and Trainspotting (1996) and the beautiful Angela's Ashes from 1999. With this man in tow, what possibly can go wrong? In usual form 28 Weeks Later is a very good shock fest, with its more than capable blood, gore and death. With an interesting and imaginative use of camera and editing techniques that really does this to its best advantage, all very exciting, captivating and enthralling, particularly the opening sequence, one of Cinemas finest. Of course we have the same music that is used in the first movie, and this does the second no harm indeed.28 Weeks Later is a delivery of great horror cinema, this genre, this newly developed genre, is taking us to new fright levels, great visuals, great atmosphere and that gives even greater heart rate levels to pulverise the nervous system. Exactly what a good horror movie should be.But, where we have a horror genre made good, we have a horrific story line that is, unfortunately, letting this movie down. With an over simple narrative and a very negligent use for its main lead that is in itself shocking and somewhat disturbing. When we have such a strong lead, a strong personality of good stock and calibre then why oh why have him trussed up and spiting blood at the world in anger? This seems very much a wasted opportunity and a shame of not utilising your best asset. We can all blend in all too easily with the red-eyed madness, but there is only an individual before the transition, and this individual is sadly missed for all the wrong reasons.Also, there is the use of the Stateside's (NATO Peaceforce) protectors, fair enough, but where does 28 Weeks Later explain the whereabouts of England's own protectors? It doesn't, they had all fled, as too did everyone else, but why had none returned? This is more bizarre and perplexing. A country, any country, would not leave itself open without seeing to its own concerns too? A Stateside sale and collaboration to drip-feed itself to a wider audience. This is the peril of the sequel, which 28 Days Later has succumbed too also. A bigger budget, a bigger profile and a bigger target audience. While not a slur on the US' but more a comment on 'movie advancement' in general. Finally, the general narrative is weak, apart from the decoration of death, disaster and decay that accompanies the mayhem of madness throughout, the story is shallow. A very simple and mediocre score that unfolds all too easily for all concerned in 28 Weeks Later. A jig-saw puzzle whose pieces fall into place at the right time for the right reason. Uncomplicated and a little uninspiring, but the bloodbath, saliva and guts covers this all too well. An all too predicable conclusion to a very imaginative concept, perhaps we'll see a better third act some time later?",6,6,11,11 May 2007
Aliens," A Dozen Movie Marines visit LV-426: An Alien asks, 'Who ordered Takeaway?'.
","Look out the Movie Marines are on their way! Dinner will soon be here, yum, yum.Well, missing out on his first chance to, shall we say rewrite, the first and the great Alien movie, his choice? We now have Walter Hill having ago for himself, the second time around. Looks like someone who didn't like Science Fiction work, he certainly knows which side his bread is buttered now.For some reason or other, the original role for Hicks had been given to James Remar, who played Ajax in Walter Hill's magnificent gang movie The Warriors (1979). His departure, as well as British born Director of Photography Dick Bush, whose work as Cinematographer on Tommy (1975), Yanks (1979) and Trail of the Pink Panther (1982) for examples, does leave some doubt and questions. To be replaced for creative differences because you didn't, it would seem, hit it off with the then Aliens Producer, Gale Ann Hurd. Oh, by the way, she, at the time was married, from 1985 to 1989, to the then Aliens Director James Cameron.We are given the impression that Aliens consists of just a few tightly grouped movie-making buddies scratching each other's back, same old Actors working, again, for the same old Director, there goes the Character Development then.While the Alien franchise is one of my favourites, I personally do think that Aliens is more overrated. While not the weakest of the whole collection, to me, this is just a bug hunt with to much off the 'yahoo' and 'yeeha' mentality. It's forever in in our face, and in the end is more important than the actual beasts that the movie should be concerning itself with. The first Alien movie, (Directed by Ridley Scott and released in 1979), is a Historical Movie Milestone of tense character development and visual art. This, Aliens, is the unsensational opposite, having gone for the Lock and Load and Egos' are Us direction, he has turned an opportunity of imagination and creativity into thought-less sensation. Looking as though it was quickly thrown together, the Thunderbirds models were looking a little thin by the end of this movie.It seemed, allegedly, that Ms Weaver threatened to do no more Alien movies after seeing the final cut.The Bold as Brass and over the top Rent-a-Heroes are the epitome of the over zealous Movie Marines that is seen in just about every movie ever made. This movie has the miss fortune of having to use this type of Movie Marine stereo typecasting, nothing new to report here, luuuteennannt Ssiiirr.Boring! Predictable! Obvious! This Egg came severely cracked and grew not into an Alien epic, but more Pigs in Space, it's a Muppet Show sketch from the 1970's.What more can I say? Except, 'Come on Aliens, put me out of my misery, and finish your dinner, because it's getting cold'.Signing Off!",4,8,24,31 January 2006

He has assembled a workforce that has worked hard to achieve a wonderful and exiting visual that is Quantum of Solace; fast edits; close-up action from start to finish, all quick, all skilfully put together this constitutes competent film-making indeed.We expect the usual, that is the new modern Bond, high octane spy adventure thriller here and we have it, with the story coming from Ian Flemings short story, in title only, this, it seems really is the end of the line of the Fleming family-tree. Sadly, this shows too, as the film progresses, we see what can also seem just an average-come-lately action film. You see, Bond is individual, Bond is maverick, Bond is trademarked. Quantum of Solace stands out on its own, or does it? When we have a new Bond, we should at least have old style, old witticism, old charms and more importantly old signature tunes.There are moments that we have to remind ourselves that we are watching a James Bond film. The new has pushed out, and advanced along the way, the old, we often see that at the sacrifice of old tunes, pleasant reminders and musical signature motto's, that at times, even the James Bond franchise seems to be so much undercover that even 'he' seems unrecognisable.What is particularly interesting is the connection between Bond and his superior, M, now the ultimate Bond girl. Given his ruthlessness and her pleasant sternness set against each other and the mixture of their works' combined makes a good team and with this comes humour and a job well done. The bad-guys are the same old bad guys and the Bond girls are just as gorgeous as ever.Unfortunately, as the pace quickens the narrative slows and falls a little flat, not the most exciting plot. Madmen wanting world domination it isn't, but for what it is, in their own unique way, even Harry Palmer, Alec Leamas, Austin Powers and dare I say it Jason Bourne could have pulled this one off. So much is the unfamiliarity and development of this new creation, we could be watching anyone here. 'Bond. James Bond'. Did he say that in the film too? Another missing link perhaps? Are the new creators' wanting to distance the old and bury the hatchet? The time has finally arrived that a Bond film has not been written by its creator. It is all too painfully obvious that this Bond just may be batting for the other side by not showing his true colours and thus blending in with his counter-parts. But hey, even with Bond heading in this new uncharted territory it brings little solace in thinking that bygones be best forgot.",5,75,143,4 November 2008
Alien vs. Predator," A Blunted Point?
","The English Oxford Dictionary states that 'The Point' is 'The most significant or relevant factor or element'.I agree, for Alien Vs. Predator seems to be lacking any relevant factors or elements that are remotely connected to the original Alien and Predator.This bombardment of butchery can produce such a negative awareness, that the participating viewer would be in complete ignorance of the fact that the original Alien and Predator franchises should only be judge in their own unique right. Here we have a horror movie amalgamation of what would seem to be a poor creation of a Frankenstein's Monster.We have no kind of narrative to relay any past information to the viewer; all we are given is a poor description of two fighting Cultures who both have the necessity for using the human race for reproducing the Alien life force. Then when these newly born creatures are born, by growing inside the willing victim, ripping open the stomachs, to fight against their archenemy, the Predator.This concept here exploits past creations of others hard work, trying its best to make something of itself by pretending to be something it certainly is not. Both the Alien and Predator creatures here are neither terrifying nor are they believably realistic. As this movie is being sold on the pretence of the Battle of the Giant's, then it has missed all significant and relevant points of reason. This reason being if you are going to amalgamate two-horror franchises, then you had best make them what their reputation's represents, such as suspense, originality, a good story and a better script.The only redeeming quality that Alien Vs. Predator has is its artwork, having an original cinema quad poster framed and hanging in my home, this is a shame that the actual movie can't live up to its imagery. Is it any wonder that Alien Vs. Predator was nominated for the 2005 Razzie Award for Worst Remake and Squeal?Point taken?",4,1,2,26 December 2005
Toy Story 4," Fourever friends:
","Number 4 has its moments that children will find funny, amusing and delightful, grown-ups will know and understand its deeper and wider implication of the narrative to see that this simply goes just beyond cuteness and cuddles. If you're unfamiliar with Toy Story and this franchise it all started during the last millilumen and the year 1995, then the second instalment fell into our laps in 1999 and subsequently propelled into the new-age for number three in 2010, and now, 2019, this fourth adventure of friends and frolics has hit the Big Screen and being produced by both Pixar Animation Studios and Walt Disney Pictures.Throughout the franchise's history its main projectile has been to convey the lifelong traits that come with companionship, camaraderie, ownership via family, trust and love. All fitting attributes to enlighten, educate and entertain through the medium of cinema. Number 4 is no different, but we are aware that this is, so far? the final addition to this tetralogy and has further significance within its framework.There is a story here that portrays all of the above, expectedly, and we see the usual gang, of course, and there are a few waifs and strays adding new personas to freshen and lighten the mood along the way; wonderful stuff.With this course of action, we see a new generation and their love all all things that those young at heart love best; toys and toys as playthings.This is the charming and underlying journey that stands out, as too, the perpetual theme throughout, of the toys as they hit the road to a new adventure; Roads are long and roads are never ending. It is this journey that Woody & co. find reason, faith and belief not only amongst themselves but within their own strength to take a wider responsibility and to broaden their own individual horizon. A fortitude to encourage those young of mind and to evaluate for those of a road further trodden; A journey, a story, fit for all, including grown-up, kids and toys alike.",5,0,2,6 October 2019
28 Days Later...," Slow deadly nights and long crazy days.
","This horrific metaphor for human disaster that is 28 Days Later works very well. Based on a story of Human despair and relentless hope for a new Birth of Man. Starting with a vision of Mans descendant, while strapped to a laboratory table, continuously forced fed to watch television clips of mass riots, murder, anger and hatred. His easily corruptible mind melting into mayhem and madness. Transcending Mayhem into Madness, Madness into Hate and Hate into Rage, rage that has not only infected the mind but goes further into the Heart and Soul of the Lifeline that flows through the veins itself.Mans ancestor is set lose, set lose by a group of unsuspecting Animal Rights Activists, thinking that they are doing right over wrong. One is bitten. All are doomed.Filmed in the deserted streets of a modern London, this apocalyptic human catastrophe is seen through the eyes of the seemingly sole survivor, Jim.Awaking from a coma 28 days (later) after the unwittingly failed rescue attempt of the infected simian, Jim soon bumps into the head strong and gutsy Selena. Who in turn find two struggling family members, father and young teen daughter, Frank and Hannah. The story continues as a struggle for survival, not only with a land of Soulless and rage-full Humans, but with the very people who they seek help from, a group of abandoned Army Soldiers. The courageous fours perpetual struggle is soon realised, and that hope and companionship is never abandoned, whatever the cost. This powerful warning to us all is never far from the truth, here we see a brainwashed Chimpanzee, forced to watch death and destruction. Turning its newly formed mind into a physical weapon, but what is this irony?Is not the Human Race a by-product of the manipulative mind of a raging simian? Is it not the simian watching Humans raging across the World? Is it not the Raging Humans, which are seen in the television footage, in the end, an influence on this fragile mind? The irony is that the rage was and always has been here, the watching simian was never the catalyst, he was an unwilling victim. We, as a responsible? Race have always brought it on our selves, we are the catalyst of our own destruction.",7,1,4,7 January 2006
I Am Legend," Good but not great, fine but not okay.
","Francis Lawrence's second movie feature, his first major being the excellent supernatural Constantine (2005), is the contemporary version of the Richard Matheson 1956 sci-fi book 'I am Legend'. Eight years later it was the great Vincent Price that stared in the Ubaldo Ragona movie of The Last Man on Earth (1964), then came The Omega Man (1971) with Charlton Heston, it is this 1971 movie that has deeper aspects of the way in which the Human Race see's itself as demigods and megalomaniacs' that pay the price of their vanity. It is here, in the 2007 version that we see a cure for cancer that sadly alters the DNA and within three years of the first cured, the human race has been wiped-out by what seems a reversal of a cure and mutating into a rabies like virus, turning the unlucky carriers into flesh eating tribes of the night. We also see the virologist Robert Neville painfully adjusting to his isolation and with this his struggle to remain sane, we see no ringing of phones here, but his possible belief that there must be, and there has to be, someone somewhere, and if there were to be, then there must be some hope, but it is his reality that overcomes this delusion of faith and it is this reality that is slowly eroding his sanity, when all he has for company are the mannequins that act as constant reminder of a past life and his trusty German Sheppard, Sam. This this done in a moderate and with at least two single shots of delicate style, Francis Lawrence has our loner more action hero, with guns-a-blazing, than deep thinker of philosophical prowess. We know his plight and see his plight, but there is no need to delve into the abyss of understanding, this is a mistake of gigantic human proportions, we see that with all good intentions something went amiss. There are no wider consequence to articulate, and with this single vision in mind, it does not. But no matter what his forte, he is still very much aware of his alienation, his freedom of daylight in a world where he is trapped in the night. This is adequately done, but again, not too deep and focused on the plight of his destiny, just everyday survival and the monotony of existence that brings home his frustrations and desolation. The sets are grand and the torn and neglected city of New York is the colossus in which our tiny and insignificant hero must reside, waiting for the day that his voice will one day be heard, waiting for that one day of hope of the human spirit to be reunited once more, and that he too shall find the cure to save his race, his mutated race, his nemesis; the dark-seekers. To once again atone for mans misadventure.All well and good I hear you cry, but, this is now where I Am Legend stagnates into weak over indulgence that has our saviour fighting shadows of CGI imagery, the irony here is so transparent. We have the good Robert Neville supposedly the last man on earth, the Omega man, fighting his soulless, mindless enemies' , who, by a technicality, are not there in the physical being, but are computer generated foes that come to haunt him in his every waking hour. This is really a poor show, to being the, literally, only human on screen when he fights for his life with these mutants is this movies weakest link. It's too obvious, it's too tasteless, it's too inconsistent, it's too easy, it's CGI. We have, once more, the grandiose actor Will Smith chosen as the leading man, and we have to admire his ability to transcend movie legend status. For his achievement and contribution to the Blockbuster genre is duly noted, but, I feel that it shall be the movie here and not his repertoire that shall make I Am Legend what it is; a simple thriller, weakly disguised as a sci-fi disaster movie of everyday survival, albeit in the empty streets of New York, that holds a sub-plot of human extinction. For a more intriguing look into this concept there is the more enlightening Russian born Boris Sagal's (1917 - 1981) interpretation of Richard Matheson's cult classic novel; The Omega Man. A darker and socially conscience take on the demise of the human race and its trappings. If you like it big, bold and beautiful then it is the 2007 version that just might be what you're looking for. The choice is yours.",3,0,2,27 December 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Times irreversible gift of splendour and magic.
","Cinema does not come as epic as this new David Fincher two hour and fifty-one minute masterpiece. Not since the days of Kubrick's Spartacus (1960), Wyler's Ben-Hur (1959) and Kusturica's vision of the break-up of Yugoslavia that is Underground (1995) these full length features are truly magnificent in their own right and with a production value second to none it is the stuff of magic and extravaganza that Cinema has come to expect.Growing foreword but aging backward, it is the tale of a man whose growing process is seen in reverse. This feature starts with a poignant prologue to express the uses of time, and what if time can run backward to replenish lost chances and to right wrongs that would, in time, hold no regrets, taking back what might have been lost, second chances and first opportunities. The regret of the tugboat captain never becoming the artist he wanted to be and the first female swimmer to have never succeeded in finishing crossing the English Channel are victims of life's regret and who cannot take away the fact that time is ever marching forward with chances lost, or are they? We see this theory within the first moments of the film, as the blind clock builder builds his clock that ticks backward so life can learn to run its course with no regret. It is time itself that is the redeeming factor that centres around Benjamin Button living and at the same time dying in reverse and the people that he comes across in his life. Francis Scott Fitzgerald's (1896  1940) 1921 short story has been given its contemporary feel by Eric Roth and Robin Swicord, who has taken Fitzgerald's concept and made it their own, the charming vision here is only propelled by its visual intake of soft tones and tranquil dexterity of Claudio Miranda's eye. It all makes for a visceral experience that throughout his life the sombre mood takes relevance over the computer-generated imagery and detracts not in the slightest to the narrative. We see the changes in the man and we see the changes in his environments and the people that grow alongside him. Where the crossroads of life meet, we too see the simple tale of Benjamin and Daisy, and it is a simple tale, any tale that life can tell, but it is the execution in the telling that holds the attention. Of course, like its older siblings, it is pure cinematic mush and this is no bad feet of engineering, which uses its modern technology to place The Curious Case of Benjamin Button at the height of Cinema excellence. Going for the ultimate, yet inevitable, conclusion, as with its peers, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, throughout his life, grows on you and never looks back.",8,1,2,7 February 2009
Transformers," Prime yourself for the ride of your life:
","It is now the year 2007 and the time-line of the infamous robot wars from deep space that started back in the nineteen eighties and throughout the last thirty years has transmogrified into what we see hear today. Michael Bay's translation of this highly regarded cult is a more than modest attempt to not just widen the appeal of this sci-fi phenomenon but to use the technology of modern film-making to its full potential. While potentially seeming to be a teen movie, with its young cast of heroes set against over bearing, but kind and loving, parents, the generation gap never seems so agonisingly embarrassing, but comical, to our young hero here and the authoritative figures that wouldn't look out of place in the next Men in Black movie, Transformers is a wonderful action and adventure sci-fi that can, and should, appeal across the broad.With the Autobots, the good guys, and the Decepticons both gunning for the same prize; Sam Witwicky, the unwitting teen who holds the one article that can save or destroy the planet, it now depends on which clan of robot will reach him first.With its origins forming in nineteen seventies Japanese culture, these tiny toys were taken overseas by the American toy company Hasbro (My Little Pony, Monopoly, Twister) near the mid nineteen eighties. After this jump from the Rising Sun to the land of prosperity it was now time for these tiny 'bots to make a big impression on the minds of a new and willing culture: The Transformers had arrived.This is pure Hollywood, pure Stars and Stripes, and being slightly a little formalistic in its delivery, with seemingly one dimensional and stereotypical caricatures, it isn't that bad a job in its more physical attributes. Whilst not altogether weak characters, some deeper development might have given this movie more scope, but, this isn't what Transformers is about, with its ethos of all action, all razzmatazz in its main concept of world domination by metallic ET's, this was never going to be a deep social comment on the subject of war and peace.Divided into two acts, the first being the introduction of our characters and 'bots, with, at times, an amusing and witty dialogue, exciting action that captivates this theme well, not too slow and not too rushed; intriguing and more than capable both in the visual and physical aspects of this genre, there really is a fine blend to keep the ball rolling in the right direction, to prep us readily for the second act.With Michael Bay utilising his skill of vision, direction and imagination it isn't long before the second act kicks in, when all are sitting comfortably in their respective roles it is now time for the action to kick in proper. It is the second act that we see these motorised warriors in their prime, it is the visual believability that holds its own, and the action and pace never lets up for a moment, this fighting of the metal giants is stupendous, fighting among the city streets and skies, if this had been 'scratch and sniff' then we would more than quiver in our seats; This is where modern movie making takes a bow and it is the work of Academy Award winner (Cocoon (1985)) Scott Farrar, Visual Effects Supervisor, and his achievement at winning the 2007 Hollywood Film Festival 'Visual Effects Supervisor of the Year' Award. His work on Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) and Jurassic Park (1993) et al show wonderment at his ability to make us believe that these robots are not mere fantasy but are actually among us, working larger than life size models of their tiny counterparts that seems now so far away from the early days of nineteen seventies Japan.",4,0,2,4 December 2007
Children of Men," A Fable: England's green and unpleasant land's.
","Caution: This review's second chapter contains minor book Spoilers, concerning the P.D. James novel The Children of Men.Director of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) and Producer to Pan's Labyrinth (2006), Mexican born Alfonso Cuarón has now delivered us Children of Men. Phyllis Dorothy James White, the British born (1920) writer penned her 1992 novel The Children of Men and having worked for the British Civil Service, spent time as a magistrate and governed the BBC her full and illustrious career is never endless. Alongside the movies screen writing team she took the 19th annual USC Libraries Scripter Award, too, the 2007 Online Film Critics Society Awards for Adapted Best Screenplay.As a book on its own it works well, as an adaptation it works extremely well, while only taking minor snippets from the novel and adding and subtracting their own brand of themes and concepts Children of Men is now one of the better movies to emerge from 2006, and notwithstanding the modern adaptation of Ian Fleming's Casino Royale.With this dystopian world ravished by war, paranoia and the frustrations, and failures, of Man the Orwellian vision of Nineteen Eighty-Four, the totalitarian future is now complete and amongst us. Female fertility has become obsolete, the Human race cannot reproduce, and no child has been born on the face of the planet for eighteen years. Man, and his future, is dying. Soon he shall be extinct. Theo, the beaten, downtrodden and middle-aged ex-political activist has unwittingly become involved in a war of an underground revolt. Here he is active once more, in the perilous journey across England's Home Counties, with a young girl, Kee, who, to Theo's bewilderment is pregnant. The first pregnant woman for more than eighteen years. This secret must be protected, at all cost, and mother and child must flee to the mysterious and enigmatic Human Project, across the seas. Their flight is a constant fight for survival. Who can be trusted? Who can keep a secret? This is the hopelessness and disdain that Alfonso Cuarón has projected, as Man is slowly becoming extinct, he, as a race, must come to terms with its own passing, that Man is not infallible, not immortal and that with His own future He must also prepare and cope with his own inevitable demise.With this premise Alfonso Cuarón, his scriptwriters and crewmembers have turned Children of Men into a vision of cinematic mastery; this is a dark world, that is, over the last eighteen years, torn itself apart, albeit in the physical, emotional and spiritual form. The mistrust of anything foreign is quickly dispersed and rejected; ethnic cleansing has never had it so good, with England's policy of returning non-nationals to their respective homelands. Reminders of past European xenophobic atrocities' such as 1930's Germany and 1990's Yugoslavia comes into mind. Here, in London 2027, with the Governing bodies and their prison camps that are brutal, callous and unforgiving, we now have a Police State, that one Theodore Faron, and working for a Governmental body the Ministry of Energy, has to endeavour.There is no government ruler here, this has been replaced by a Warden, The Warden of England, Ministers are represented by democracy, here anarchy is governed by a self-appointed Warden, and here too is the pecking order of the British class system, this is emphasised more by the use of the concept of animals. The rebel underground activists who call themselves The Fishes. While Julian has the tiny tattoo of a swallow on her neck, the symbol for independent freedoms perhaps? The tiny fragile songbird whose wings, sadly, are clipped. Theo, on the other hand, has been given the qualities of what appears to be of Saint Francis, Patron Saint for animals, it is the animals in this movie that seem to have a connection with Theo, a six sense that they, and only they, can recognise the quality of a higher being, a Saviour. In the final battle, we have a heard of sheep, controlled sheep and their dogs running, fleetingly, through the streets, the symbol of chaos of the masses that are guided and pushed by the dogs. Which in turn are also controlled by the pigs, and toward the end, we repeat the scene that is hanging on the wall of the Warden's dinning room Picasso's black and white painting Guernica and the effects of war and disorder. The ruling classes that populate the schism between the oppressed and their high-ranking counterparts. The all seeing pigs, their affluence, power and greed that crush these doomed sheep, and guide them to their slaughter.Emmanuel Lubezki's work here as cinematographer is astounding. His talents have rewarded him with numerous recognitions for Children of Men, be it B.A.F.T.A., the Chicago Film Critics Association Awards, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards, National Society of Film Critics Awards, USA, Online Film Critics Society Awards and the Venice Film Festival, and not forgetting his 2007 Academy Award nomination for 'Best Achievement in Cinematography'. His vision is a powerful thoroughfare of Mans destructive capabilities, and with an insight to seeing the real world via dark, bleak and graphic detailing that war can bring. However, where the Children of Men transcends into great cinematic craftwork is the style of camera-work that Alfonso Cuarón has developed, with his extendedly long camera shots, and with minimal edits, we literally are alongside Theo and his contemporaries. These long uncut hand-held shots are what makes Children of Men work at ground level, and with this believability, photography and sensitivities we have a movie that has delivered.",9,3,5,16 January 2007
Black Hawk Down," Black: Moody: Brilliant.
","Black Hawk Down is filmed eight years after the event of the Battle of Mogadishu, the capitol of Somalia in North East Africa. Based on the book Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War by Mark Bowden and directed by Ridley Scott.The true story of American soldiers, during October 3rd and 4th, 1993, who, having been sent to the heart of the City, an enemy stronghold, and to capture and return the warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid. In the exercise of their duty, two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters are shot down in the middle of the City, an extremely close combat battle then commences.Being one of the rarer and finer American war movies, that does not play on the clichÃ©d ego trip, that we have come to see during the last twenty years or so of this genre. Could this also be because the cast here consists of a mixed bag of internationals, such as American, British and Scottish actors, even with their poor American accents to boot? The cinematography on Black Hawk Down is aesthetically clear and concise; with fine detail to colour, temperament and texture, that really does set the mood of the environment. The pacing of this movie is neither too fast nor does it leave you looking at your watch. With the right ingredient for character build up and development, we can feel an empathic understanding of these unfortunate souls.This is a very well shot movie too, of tight battle scenes that draws us into and unquestionably involves the viewer at ground level. We are left with a guided tour of duty in the comfort of our Cinema and living rooms, the atmosphere is well articulated and we are left with camaraderie that has over spilled into our hearts and mind.Black Hawk Down is a movie not of ego but of comradeship and the partnership of one man equals all men; this is a very good movie indeed, with very little bad language, it really is not needed. This movie relies on the sometimes graphic and the sentimentality's that war can bring, to deliver home that one can watch a good movie as well as make them.Black Hawk Down is a unique and refreshing war film, knowing that is it is a real event and seeing what the Soldiers had to endure is captivating. With the help of Ridley Scott at the helm, it will make any war movie genre fan want to pin it down and watch with an understanding that the ego does not make the Soldier, but the Soldier makes the Man.A different way to make a War movie..",7,1,2,4 April 2006
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Lacks structure and pace. Mr. Yates needs to brush up on his interpretation skills.
","Be it the first or the last season, but excluding the third, with Harry and his friends at Hogwarts, this years school term feels exactly the same as the previous terms. This year we see a much drawn-out affair that takes great pains to expel any adventure and fun, yes, fun. For the same messages that we have become accustomed to, such as Harry's parents, Lord Voldemort's so-called appearance and his good-time older friends treating him as the child that they, and we too, still see him as, is no fun to watch any longer. He really does need to become more assertive and independent, this does happen in a tiny moment, but it seems more tantrum and transcendence.With the conspiracy theorists out to outdo our hero's reputation, once more, it really is surprising how much this young man can take after the last four years, Harry is led into the world of the Order of the Phoenix, an organisation banded together, by the elder wizards and witches, to challenge the evils of Lord Voldemort. But what a waste, as Harry is pampered around these guardians, it is obvious that these magnificent men, and women, on their flying machines are only a fleeting and almost none affair throughout the entire movie. Whose only appearance, toward the end, is to do battle with their evil nemesis, the final battle, if we can call it that, is over before it starts, another anticlimax to an uneventful journey in the life of master Potter and his friends.The short-lived characters coming and goings, and more often goings, such as Rubeus Hagrid and his journey to the land of giants, to find allies, but only comes back with a half-wit brother who serves no purpose at all, and what did become of these giants? Hagrid, along with Remus Lupin and Alastor 'Mad-­Eye' Moody, who no doubt we'd like to have seen more off, felt like they were just there to prop up the plot and serve as little purpose as possible. All well and good perhaps, but wasn't the title of this fifth term called the Order of the Phoenix? We know that a Phoenix can regenerate itself but these Phoenix's make very little time and effort to generate any screen time at all, it is then bewildering and farcical as to why the movie was called Order of the Phoenix in the first place. Having read the book, I can fully understand, but these are two completely different mediums here, and to simply take one from another and pass it off as the first is both dangerous and arrogant. To have so many holes and questions left unfulfilled and unanswered in this movie can possibly do irreversible damage to its reputation as a whole. Are the movie makers of these novels becoming complacent or are the books too long too interpret into the medium of film? This could be just giving the public what they want, but to judge them as a whole, as two mediums that should work as one is too a dangerous act. One plus one may not always add up to one here, as we have been shown, but it does add up to two, without a doubt: Novel vs. Movie. Take your pick.Yet again, the emphasis is centred on Harry and his friends, of course, and this time becoming that little more rebellious, that little more independent, and why not, while the cats are away the mice shall play. But do we have to be constantly reminded of his poor dear parents, his poor old scar and while all this is going on it truly distracts from the adventure and excitement of magic and witchcraft. The opening sequence looked very promising (and how much has young Dudley Dursley changed, until his name was spoken he was unrecognisable, he seems to be the first to have a completely new personality) but then we see the same, if not very much older and larger actors, as to can be said for Mr and Mrs. Weasley, uncle and aunt, setting the same rift and contempt. Another term, another year, and another pound around the old waistlines of all our favourite characters'.Yes, this David Yates interpretation of the J.K. Rowling novel is more prone to droughts of fulfilment and stimulation than the highly sub-plotted, imaginative and creative Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) by Alfonso Cuarón, in all areas of movie-making here. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2008) shall be the final term of endeavour and with Mr. Yates at the top of the class once more. Let's hope he has learnt some very important lessons by then, or detention may not be enough, expulsion may be his only option if he fails to rise up to the level of courageous and inventive movie-maker and there are no excuses for not delivering the goods on time.

The Descent," FRYHTO: An Old English word for.....
","Mrs Pankhurst and her Daughters just might have enjoyed this movie. Its great to see a film that the women are taking control off, is it me or are male dominated movies, The Cave for example, getting a little too much of themselves lately? Boys will be boys.I have NEVER walked out of a cinema after a showing EVER and had to stop and say to myself 'What have I just seen?' The unsettling feeling in my stomach wouldn't go away for an age, having to tell my Wife that she was driving the fifteen miles back home, because the film that we'd seen had scared the hell out of me and that I'm still in shock. I drove back safely, but was making a point that this film has been one of the scariest, frightening and intense movies I had seen for a VERY long time! Being an 18 certificate here in England made all the difference, a grown up gore movie for a grown up audience, its not all about 'the gore' but a good story line and script does help, nice one.I really am getting tired and bored of having to put up with going to see a kids film, 15 certificate or younger, that refuses to treat you as an 18 certificate or older and then try to do its best with the restrictions of a 15 certificate, thus selling you short of a true gore movie, i.e. The Cave.People who have the mentality of wanting to watch it (any) on DVD first just don't know what the Cinema Experience really means. The Big Screen IS the only way to see a movie of this calibre, ironically it's the telly addicts that are selling themselves short.The pace never slackened, the claustrophobic atmosphere never gave way to their enclosed plight, causing the senses to give way to sheer helplessness and doubt that transcended this feeling of fright into my knotted stomach.The irony is that the woman with the least to live for, she just wasn't having a very good year was she? Lived the longest and wanted to die the sooner, she got her Final Wish in the end, to be with her Daughter. You did empathise with her.My Wife liked the film, she was very happy with it too.If you're going to pay to be scared, then we didn't pay enough, because we still cant get over it! Atmospheric! Brilliant! Scary! Frightful! Memorable! I'm sorry if it looks like I'm repeating myself but I cant say enough about this film and the WOW Factor that it gave me and the Wife, over my mind, body and Soul. The interpretation of this experience in Cinema terminology is having a case of 'Jumping out of your seat' syndrome, the only way to cure this dilemma? GO AGAIN.Dog Soldiers is also a great movie.Thanks Neil.",9,2,5,9 October 2005
The Da Vinci Code," A Code with its own Cross to bear.
","The Da Vinci Code: The, so far, highest anticipated blockbuster of the year for 2006, or the most, again so far, media hyped movie of the year. Whatever the viewpoint, for what ever reason, The Da Vinci Code turned out to be a nice little thriller, little here being the operative word, regrettably too. A thriller it is, with its beautiful English locations, such as the Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland, Lincoln Cathedral, which was substituted for Westminster Abbey, London and Burghley House, again in Lincolnshire, England. The European destinations speak volumes here, such as the filming inside the Musée Du Louvre and the Ritz Hotel in Paris, France. These locations give the movie a taste of flamboyance and style. They are used very well, to inject a world of high-octane adventure that only the gifted and elite can acquire.The cast here are of a pedigree to hold audiences captivated in their own right, with the skills of Messrs Hanks, McKellen and Reno and the French actress Audrey Tautou, who apparently, took the job after the original choice were for Julie Delpy and Kate Beckinsale. In addition, the role that was, eventually, given to Tom Hanks was considered for Bill Paxton, amongst others. This collaboration come together very well, in their own refined and subtle way, they are given a fictitious project to be apart off, they are in a plot of huge consequence and intrigue, the magnitude of the overall conspiracy theory is some what, sadly, eroded and in parts, deflated.The historical story telling, by using a sense of flashback and a over lapping of the past with the present is interesting, this form of movie making is a procedure that does The Da Vinci Code justice and actually does project the story line to the next phase, giving the movie a true sense of Historical wonder and dread.Apart from the high level locations and cast, we have a movie that is somewhat over drawn in the writing department, in the interpretation of Dan Browns book, who also acts as Executive Producer on this project too. Has Mr. Akiva Goldsman found this a tad too taxing? This question begs being asked, in the contest of a huge Production, why has The Da Vinci Code gone from being a Thriller Movie to a thrilling movie that does not thrill hardly enough? The script, I feel, has driven The Da Vinci Code's pace, in places, from high-octane to moderate B-Movie status. This is a shame, for who ever was in charge of this department should, again I feel, have looked more closely at reading between the lines, and given it more attention, this, regrettably, could be the weakest link in this movies chain. Alternatively, and fairly, has he merely adapted his skills to the environment that he has been placed in? Mr. Goldman's other works for writing and screenplay consist of The Client 1994, Silent Fall 1994, Batman Forever 1995, A Time To Kill 1996, Batman & Robin 1997, Lost In Space 1998, also for I, Robert 2004 and the 2005 movie Cinderella Man. He has been nominated for many Awards in his career; he won has the 2002 Academy Award for Best Writing for A Beautiful Mind 2001.The musical score is also worth a mention, with the work of Mr. Hans Zimmer, who during the early eighties was in the band The Buggles, their hit 'Video Killed the Radio Star' became their best seller. He has worked on many, many classics such as My Beautiful Laundrette 1985, The Last Emperor 1987, Rain Man 1988, Thelma and Louise 1991. His vast workload was to include The Lion King 1994, The Rock 1996, Mission Impossible II and Gladiator in 2000. He worked on Black Hawk Down in 2001 and the list is endless. His work on The Da Vinci Code is a fine classical score that highlights the high quality message of this movie, with a combination of drama and suspense that kicks starts each moment into daring adventure.To conclude: The Da Vinci Code is a good movie, it is a reasonably good thriller, with very stylish locations, cast and modest Director, but it, not at all points, tends to, for me, fall on the flat side, because of the high importance of the overall story line, the delivery of the script has fallen short. This is the Cross that The Da Vinci Code now has to bear. Shame really.",6,1,2,24 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Detention for Mr. Newell for the lack of Plagiarism.
","This film was directed by Mike Newell, of Four Wedding's and a Funeral (1994), and Pushing Tin (1999) fame. Here we see his interpretation of J.K. Rowling's novel The Goblet of Fire. His career mainly consists of T.V. Direction, since 1964, and a smattering of movies. Plagiarism isn't the order of the day here, which is a pity, because if you are going to sell the book rights to the movie industry, then we would hope that it would or should, at least, stick to the original story. As naive as it sound's. This is the poorest of the four Potter movies so far. The story was non-existent, the character development was extremely shallow and the overall content was less than mediocre to say the least. The plot being that He who shall not be named comes back, again, to wreak havoc, almost. This only occurs during the final half hour or so. While the rest of the movie, the whole film being around two hours and forty minutes long, fair enough, is based on a tournament that contains three dangerous tasks. The conclusion at the end of the final task is that Harry unwittingly becomes His prisoner, here we go again. Thus ending in a show down, a very quick and positively anti climatic show down, a little like the first movie. The ending came a little too sudden, which seems a wasted opportunity considering the length of this movie, and because of the lack of build up, the final show down was neither exiting nor worthy off a movie of this stature. Apart from the shots of the Quidditch World Cup games at the beginning of the film, the hapless gang of three never leave the school grounds during the entire movie. This makes for a very stale and drawn-out plot. The sense of magic, meaning Wizards, Witches, Wands and Broomsticks etc, is lost in this over produced eye candy. There is a little too much distraction with what seem in places, unnecessary digital effects, which weakens the plot by substituting substance over effect. This movie (concept) has grown up since its birth, but as it has grown older, it has, like most healthy teenagers, become lost in its own World, thus needing a guiding hand or wand if you wish, to point it back in the right direction. Go to the top of the class for effort Mr Newell, but expect very little marks for content.",3,13,25,18 November 2005
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Armitage Shanks, we have a job for you.
","What the hell is going on here? Rhetorical question aside, we can seriously see for ourselves that this second movie of the Transformers franchise is an abysmal rash on the arse end of a toilet bacteria doing the rounds in the U-bend of life. While losing its way in the wasting sewers of time that is the completely unnecessary and over-the-top eye-candy that populates this self-pleasing world of Kruger, Orci and Kurtzman, who, at the same time does more than insult the intelligence of their audience. Suggesting, for example, that by the time of reaching middle age, Judy Witwicky does not have the slightest clue as to what she has in her possession when taking young Sam to University. If this was placed into the final draft to execute giggles from its audience then it just could not have been a more stone cold sobering moment if it had not tried any harder. A pure ridiculous and unneeded moment.The foresight of imagination in the auditorium is made more limited by the smoke and mirrors that are here to distract the basic observations of realities from the fanciful, comic puerile tendencies that is Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.With a slant on a propaganda front, the coupling of the Untied States and her ally Great Britain, it seems more than a smattering of topical eventualities' than two nations gunning for one common mechanical purpose. This, and the nauseating sequence of 'families of war' and the more than coincidence of Mr. and Mrs. Witwicky being placed in the heart of the battle to project the unity of support and concern is slightly worrying. In that this movie seems that it has to pull itself in this direction of topical heartstrings that is, in the end result, more propaganda than entertainment.Still, the world of intergalactic terrorism is prominent within this celluloid farce as is, too, the MTV news channels that regurgitate the similar dross with still endless results. The seamless narcissistic, ego boosting war machine we see here is ludicrous: blast 'em with all ya got! And just how 'did' those U.S. tanks end up in the Egyptian desert? Think beyond the margin and it will transcend you into the wider appreciation of just how shallow and egocentric this second instalment is.Apart from the shoddy continuity edit's, childish humour, DVD selling eye-candy and overall poor execution of plot, the cowardice of the use of foul language, if you are going to say IT then say IT; fear of losing its 12a (UK) certificate would seem more worrying than the fear of losing the third instalment war of cinema seats it seems.Sadly, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen has fallen, fallen into the arms that are Armitage Shanks, leaving you more than a little flushed, it will leave you empty, relieved and thanking god that that is all over.",2,13,29,25 June 2009
War of the Worlds," 'Waiter, the Bill please.'
","My wife and I go to the Cinema as often as possible and we love it (we don't have a Sky dish or Cable), 'Watch it on DVD' our friends say, 'Your loss' we reply. The Big Screen, there is no substitute.But hey, what are the big Hollywood Producers all raving about? 'Not enough bums on seats this summer? What's going on? Aren't these seasons movies good enough for these people?' That's funny, obviously complacency is the ordered dish of the day, in their little planet they call Hollywood.I mean, come on, didn't they go and watch the interpretation of H.G. Wells classic novel War of the World's? Then again we wished we hadn't either. What an absolute let down. We thought we were going to see a Monster Movie about two fighting planets. No, we ended up seeing a glorified domestic. The bad guys where just a side dish on this sour meal of bland and predictable spice less tripe. This meal came served cold.Being a 12a in England, you seem to be getting the idea of the target audience and its mentality, not that Mr Spielberg wants more grown-ups to take their ankle biters to the Cinema, more bums on seats, in theory, but in practise? You figure it out.We, like most people that saw it felt that the concept of the H.G. Wells novel and this movie was as far removed from each other as chalk and cheese. Why call it War of the Worlds and claim that it was based on the novel by Mr Wells? ('Don't need to read the book as I've seen the film' says little Johnny to his Teacher, if it wasn't so painful I'd be crying). If Mr Wells was still alive he just might be suing for misrepresentation. No doubt, the Producers would be saying he would be counting his money? Someone must be?Mr Spielberg has had some original concepts, but this is another Americanisation/Spielberg/Hollywood smoke screen. After getting indigestion too often people are not going to enter the restaurant, its not sour grapes but a fact of life!Is America really the Narcissus of the World? Do they really care? Well, the lack of profits should hit the right note Echoing off empty cinema seats this summer (2005). Maybe I'll rent the DVD next time? Whose loss? Both I think.Live and Learn, we have.",1,13,23,4 October 2005
Joker," Cognitive dissonance: It will either make you or break you.
","New York, during the latter half of the nineteen seventies and tipping into the nineteen eighties was financially bankrupt; an explosion of destitution, crime, immorality and insanity. This feature, within 'Joker', has its parallels within the realm of a New York city that we see here set against an old crumbling fictitious Gotham City, ruined, too, by bankruptcy, crime, immorality and madness. This, unfortunately, is the home of one Arthur Fleck. A man that leaves very little mark on his surroundings and all those he meets. He's a man who supports both himself and his aging, dependent mother through work as a party clown; putting on a happy face. His councillor and many medications say otherwise.He's a man stoical in his ways. He's a man who travels by bus. He's a man who, still, lives with his mother. Arthur Fleck is a proletariat of a nondescript nature. Arthur Fleck is a victim. Arthur Fleck is both lonely and insane.Born of frustration, this alienated soul has befallen prey to cruel indifference from a society that leaves only a pinprick of light at the end of this very long, dark tunnel but at the same time, this very same soul, leaves an indelible speck of growing self-pity and grudge bearing resentment toward oneself and for those who reject, pour disdain and derision to those who grasp for the light. Only darkness pursues within the mind of one Arthur Fleck.The world of Arthur Fleck is perpetuated by an eerie soundtrack throughout this film set against the grating, monotone effect of Ms. Hildur Ingveldar Guðnadóttir's (b.1982) haunting violoncello as too Arthur Fleck's own lifebuoy of classic and contemporary tunes to render or pacify his state of mind. This leading composition of soundtracks' and inner signature tune conjoins beautifully with the visual production of the films landscape. Here we see, hear and feel for this poor, lost soul. It is here, in a Gotham that is unforgiving we see the final phase of this man's inner sanctum finally crumbling around him; his cognitive dissonance hits hard. Extremely hard. Reawakening as all that he sees, hears and feels.This premise, in part, though very slight, but recognisable, has a parallel to Paddy Chayefsky's (1923-1981) disillusioned, but also reawakened, character 'Howard Beale' played by Peter Finch (1916-1977) in the 1976 film 'Network', Arthur Fleck, too, is '...I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore...'.This too can coincide with the films reference to Charlie Chaplin's (1889-1977) 1936 feature 'Modern Times' by comparing Arthur Fleck to the feckless and bumbling character known as 'A Factory worker'. No matter how hard he tries, all is in vain.This context of this feature may run alongside the 'The Joker' universe, the universe that is D.C. proper, but this portrayal runs wider here to a degree that 'The Joker' as an individual, an arch nemesis of good and more central to the Gotham elite and to be judged by the company that he keeps is unique and separate within his individual universe. Here Arthur Fleck, now 'Joker', is a sum of its parts, here he is more than representative. He is everyone. He is symbolic of a society that understands and empathises and experiences' his woes; they too are '...as mad as hell...and not going to take it anymore...'.With the assistance of Messrs Phillips, Silver and Mr. Phoenix alike this character study, and social introspective, of a downward spiral into self-destructiveness is, once more, more than a sum of its parts; It is beautifully shot, the colours and texture that run across the screen, the defining musical personas, the personalities within these back alleys and mean streets, its sociological perspective more than blends atmosphere and tone it catapults the whole hypothesis into a stark and extremely bold cautionary tale of the delicate line of how culture, of how civilisation can seemingly implode but that the last joke just well may be on us all.",9,1,1,13 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Wanna play a game of Tag, You're It?
","Gary Dauberman, as Screenwriter, has done a tremendous job of reworking and revitalising Mr. King's novella of a very naughty clown that comes out to play once in every twenty-seven years. This, being the second instalment of a double-bill, with the first chapter being released in 2017, but, both here is an amalgamation of the exceedingly atmospheric television movie (1990) of the same name.It Chapter Two starts off twenty-seven years hence when our miniature heroes are fully grown-up and each having spread their collective wings and fled the roost that is small-town Derry, Maine, USA. Except one. The one, that is, recalling, reclaiming the flock to honour the oath that was once committed to each other twenty-seven years previously.It Chapter Two has the best of both worlds, a schism if you will, in this, we see, more than simply a telling of the horror genre. We see horror in many aspects here, as expected, but what is interesting is that we see, also, melodrama, nostalgia, responsibility, reflection, guilt and deeper, more concerning adult themes of forbidden love, bigotry, sexual phobia, sexual repression and suicide and all within a strong context of friendship, honour, loyalty that builds into a framework of parallel worlds of the horrifying Pennywise and the bonds that were the young children of twenty-seven years back to concatenating old memories and events from the middle-aged adults.What, too, exemplifies the charged atmosphere is the wonderful work from Checco Varese (cinematography) and all involved with Direction from Andy Muschietti to the many that gives here a more than spellbinding array of visual delight and astonishment. This is simply a gripping visual display of imagination and fortitude bringing together good & evil within one single conceptual chef-d'oeuvre.With the illustrious Mr. Hader, the charismatic Mr. McAvoy to the distinguished Ms. Chastain at the forefront there is a significantly strong cast that bounces off each other projecting charisma that gives the film a wider sense of personality that examines the element of both youthful and older cast together. While we see the charm of Mr. Skarsgård and his goading of the main players, it is all here, and their respective parts that are more than the foundations holding this piece together.It Chapter Two is no circus. This is all out, all unforgiving horror, on many levels, and within its fabric there lies a clown and its prey, once more: all grown up.",7,0,0,15 September 2019
The Wrestler," Breaking bones with sticks-and-stones, and hearts
","Filmed in glorious 16mm, the wonderful format of the 'amateur', the maverick, the Independent moviemaker, and casting a symbolic texture of street-level realism. Here, we see Darren Aronofsky, along with the likes of Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) and the work by Shane Meadows, such as Dead Man's Shoes (2004) and This Is England (2006) for example, bringing the Independent feel to the Big Screen once more with The Wrestler. While in good company, The Wrestler alongside Herz's and Kaufman's The Toxic Avenger (1984), Hallström's and Hedges's What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), Andrea Arnold's beautiful and touching Red Road (2006) and Noel Clarkes' work, for example, all have that Independent vibe about them. This is what separates them from the norm, the need to express their thoughts onto film without the constraints of mediocrity. All highly imaginative, unique, fresh and individual pieces of work that are testament to the skill of all those involved by venturing further a field with daring and courage. The Wrestler is certainly no exception.While a title in the sense of a singular, perspective we can very quickly gather that there is a much wider and broader feel to the content. This, The Wrestler, is not so much about a single entity but a whole way of life, a sub-culture, who through immense pride and camaraderie, find that life on the right side of the ropes can become exciting and justly rewarding. Darren Aronofsky and writer Robert D. Siegel, on the other hand, have produced a film of immense sorrow and suffering seen via a victim of the times and literally time itself. Mickey Rourke's Randy 'The Ram' Robinson could very well have been anyone, in fact, he is 'everyone', he has become symbolic of these past, present and future aging, bruised and battered men, crippled and broken spiritually, physically and emotionally by constant years of hard, torturous abuse for the sport they love and that has loved them in return and which now rejects them. One has only to see the scene of realisation and hard reality check while The Ram has set his table of old videos and posters ready for autographing, sits along fellow comrades too far gone and broken, it finally sinks in that he too has now joined the destitute and lost. Beautiful.Seen here is the life of the hardships of those who were born just too late. Too late for everlasting fame. Too late for that all-important Cable T.V. deal. Too late for the Video-game merchandise rights and too late for lady-luck to grace her way to better times ahead before the fading light of fame has flickered and died and past the point of no return. This is a very simple tale with honest hard-working characters who are striving to earn a buck to pay the rent, to feed their kids, making ends meet to justify the end. The mighty may have fallen but they have not given up, maybe through a need of necessity rather than love of their profession, they carry on. These are not stupid people, criminals they are not and living in poverty, bedding down in trailers or if that also includes working nights pole-dancing, such as Marisa Tomei's 'Cassidy', makes them just as worthy of praise if they are willing to simply try.It is in this life that both writer and director have projected a loving narrative of loneliness. With The Rams back-room bonding and mutual respect of his co-wrestlers' that is very much replicated, it is here that the life of this tired old man finds the necessary tools to fill the void. Often touching and more than often painful to bear witness that his life is completely empty albeit the roar of the crowed, their adulation and what little pennies it earns. It is with great praise, also, that Mickey Rourke has held the spirit of this sub-culture high with grace and virtue, a stupendous performance that shines throughout to transcend the pathos of his lonely existence, on the wrong side of the ropes. An exceedingly moving film, beautifully exposing the harsh realities of a life, a way-of-life, of a broken man and his courage to see his faults and his determination to pull himself up and away from the slings-and-arrows that are thrown toward him. The Wrestler wins this bout.",8,1,1,22 January 2009
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," Siblings Unrivalled.
","Stunning, beautiful and heart rendering.This fantastic movie based on the perils of war and division, that falls upon the nations that is North and South Korea is a mind-blowing journey of two brothers caught up in the fight between the cross fire that are these two great States.With absolute breathtaking realism, the action, the battle scenes, is sheer brilliance. We are subjected to pure tension and dynamism that has to be continued throughout this two and a half hour ordeal. This movie will have your emotions on a roller coaster ride till the very end; to say that Taegukgi will leave a lasting impression is saying only a tiny amount, this movie will try for your jugular, then it will rip out your heart.Besides the very beautiful musical score, by Dong-jun Lee, that are the wheels of your roller coaster, driving us to the highs and lows of our journey, there is the stunning and very effective Cinematography of Kyung-Pyo Hong that it the visual dialogue for our journey into the chaos of war.Not so much a war movie, but a movie based around war, to make us understand that in this World of ours, there is evil that lurks in the shadows, to place the breaks on our roller coaster and to propel us to fight Common Man against Common Man, for the sake of a better ideology, regardless of circumstance and casualties.Taegukgi is not a story of the Brotherhood of war, but how families can be torn into desperate, unwanted and uncontrolled terror, to debase us, to become non-human, to kill, and having the will power to survive the atrocities that fall at our doorstep and to recognise this difference.Taegukgi is truly a heart-rending story of two brothers and the pact of the elder to protect his younger sibling, for the sake of their Mother, this movie will have you in shock at the horror of war, and at the same time, in emotional turmoil.Truly astounding and moving, till the very last turn of the wheels.Watch it. Feel It.",10,4,5,27 March 2006
Casino Royale," Old Dog, New Tricks.
","Bond is back. This reinvention of Ian Fleming's first Bond story is captivating and exhilarating as it is magnificent. With the lack of gadgets and witty innuendoes, Casino Royale is back to basics thuggery and tough guy masculinity. The action is fast paced as it is well thought out, with tremendous stunts and action sequences that hypnotise and excite.With lavish locations, as to be expected, such as Venice, already used in From Russia With Love (1963) and Moonraker (1979), the Bahamas, Prague and nooks and crannies in-between. This is a stupendous crossover from a classic 1952 story to a modern upbringing, while respecting the old, intermingling of the two is done effortlessly and timelessly, the last Bond movie to use the Ian Fleming moniker was The Living Daylights (1987) some nineteen years hence.Daniel Craig is well suited to this new era of Bond, his no nonsense stance is calibrated to be exactly what the Bond franchise needed. This franchise was slowly eroding into parody, it was the dog that was chasing its own tail, the only way to come into the new millennium and beyond was to reinvent, to revitalise, and with having the luck of the first Fleming story, finally, this introduction has become an impressive first taste of what is yet to come.Admittedly, with the new age of CGI that the past Bond movies seem to need to survive, they have become lifeless and dull. Casino Royale seems to use little CGI and relies on the old fashioned school of stunts and action, a great twist in the tail that has this mad dog of an Englishman needing no substitutes for the real thing, and with great reverence, this has worked wonders for the franchise. Great stuff, great result. Bond is back.",9,1,3,29 November 2006
Fantastic Mr. Fox," A fox's tale of charm, wit and non-stop motion.
","Roald Dahl (1916 - 1990) wrote some truly beautiful children's stories, for example: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach and Matilda (and who scripted films as You Only Live Twice (1967) and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968)), all made into film, and this too, now includes his 1970 creation 'Fantastic Mr. Fox'.It is the story of one Mr. Fox and his wild-ways of hen heckling, turkey taking and cider sipping, nocturnal, instinctive adventures. Now married and with cub, he has to put his wild days behind him and do what fathers do best: be responsible. He is too rebellious, he is too wild and he is going to try 'just one more raid' on the three nastiest, meanest and fox hating farmers that are Boggis (Brian Cox), Bunce (Hugo Guinness) and Bean (Michael Gambon). The direction here is suburb, extremely humorous characters and personalities that project a warm, charismatic, optimistic adventure for all ages. There are chuckle-out-loud as there are certainly laugh-out-loud moments here, the close-ups of Mr. Fox's 'grin' and his tiny friends 'vacant staring eyes' are worth their weight in gold. This too, is a visually interesting film that has been done with a Nikon D3 35mm digital single-lens reflex camera and stop-motion techniques that give a wonderful cinema experience. It is a far away cry from the classic and golden days of Charles -Émile Reynaud (1844 - 1918), the pioneer of animated film, and Ray Harryhausen (b. 1920) et al, and it works a treat.Okay, only Mr. Dahl's story, apparently, is used during what we can call the 'middle section' of the film and with added new parts both front and rear, this may just explain why, with the final 'toast' by Mr. Fox, there seems to be a serious note, or message, that concerns 'survival'. This may seem too pessimistic, too out of place for this narrative, this may be the director telling his audience the contemporary message, that it really is a dog-eat-dog world and that we have to do what needs to be done to 'survive'.Take away the gloss, and all Mr. Fox is, and lives by, are his basic instincts to kill and steal in order to survive. A cynical, and possibly, a pessimistic approach, but I do believe that this may be the narratives undercurrent message here. Also, there seems to be a very 'un-Englishness' feel about this film, from the very start we are delving into a high-octane cast, and soundtrack, that is all too obvious in its origins, yes, the farmers are from the other side of the pond, but it is not they who are the selling point. On the positive, this alone cannot distract from the charming, rich and freshness feel of Fantastic Mr. Fox, it is a breath of fresh air, literally, and it is also one more credit to the writing of one Mr. Fantastic Roald Dahl.",8,6,13,23 October 2009
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Kids fantasy suddenly grows up.
","Star Wars, and how two into one will not go. There are two very different interpretations to this movie, though not suffering from any schizoid tendencies as such, but more of a conflict of interest's.Here we have the eleven-year-old boy who first saw this movie at his local Cinema, way back in 1977. This was one of the biggest movies of all time, as was the Great Hollywood classics of their times, Gone with the Wind and The Wizard of Oz both from the Thirties, Citizen Kane arrived during the Forties, Ben Hur in the Fifties and from the Sixties we were given Psycho. These movies, all in their own right, were movies of great significance, from a Cinematic point of view. Until the 25th of May 1977, the seventies had produced very little in Cinematic splendour and worldwide success. That was until the release of George Lucas's Star Wars. The World was about to explode. The World went Star Wars crazy. Mr Lucas had succeeded in making not only the biggest blockbuster of the Seventies, but had kick started a whole new generation of movie fans and Cinema-goers Worldwide. Loosely intertwined around the 1958 Japanese story The Hidden Fortress and the 1972 Silent Running movie, amongst others, he had become over night one of Hollywood's greatest assets. Star Wars not only appealed to the very young, but to a wide spectrum of Movie lovers, apart from containing the qualities of a good story, such as Science Fiction, Adventure and Romance, Star Wars contained that one magic formula, that the audience, might, just might, relate to the life of that Country boy, Luke, the frustrated and oppressed life style,and becoming ever so eager to support him in his quest for Manhood , and to finally become accepted.This eleven-year-old boy, too, had become Star Wars crazy, he too was awe struck at its fantastic effects, the adventures of the Good Guys and how they battled across the Galaxy, flying to far away Planets and wonders. The Good Guys deserved to win and the Bad Guys deserved everything they got, and in the meantime, the adventure was on. He was captivated. A Childhood moment that would stay forever. Being only eleven, he saw nothing wrong in the way the too simplistic dialogue was delivered on screen. He did not know of the indifference of the main leading Actor, Sir Alec Guinness, maybe due to the fact that he seemed completely embarrassed to have any connection with Star Wars. He would not have understood the concept of hype and exploitation, and as he was growing up would come to realise that Star Wars, as great as it was, did not match up to the expectations of his Childhood. Seeing this movie through grown up eyes, he become more susceptible to a cynical viewpoint, or should that also be a realistic view?The movie as a whole is very good, but now, many years later, he came to realise that some things are best left in the past, and that Star Wars of 1977 was a far better and different movie than the Star Wars of today, this is in no way what so ever a comparison of the two different Star Wars movies of past and present, but of Star Wars in itself. It has stood the test of time; it has made its mark on Cinema history and all the better for it. However, it is time to move on to Galaxies new and explore new Cinematic Worlds. Star Wars: One of the earliest Cinematic experience I have had the pleasure to watch.",10,0,1,21 November 2005
Moon," Phasing the mind with lunacy.
","A Robinson Crusoe in space? Well, apparently not, this is far deeper than the basic isolationist narrative. Set on the surface of the sleeping satellite, this is as far reaching from home as it could be. For all things indifferent, this plot could well have been set in a deep mine, the highest tower or the most offshore island, but the moon it is, it makes for a fitting and just location for paranoia, confusion and lunar lunacy.At first, it seems that we have a Silent Running (1972) scenario here, minus the crews, but as we delve deeper into the life of Sam Bell, it is apparent that it is he alone who has the arduous task of keeping his strength and sanity at the forefront of his mind, body and soul. As this space flick progress, it becomes apparent that it has more in common with Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), albeit similar internal settings, the singular space crew and the infamous independent thinking robot assistant, here called GERTY as opposed to 2001's HAL. It is all in a setting and scale that can be very quickly assessed that this parallel world to 2001 is only as strong as its own blend of involvement in this genre.It's a fine visual environment that when seen on the big screen has its impressive moments that any half-decent sci-fi movie can throw at you, a moderate set-piece and the wide shots of the lunar surface and that of the far distant earth does not miss the mark. It may not be as deep and as rich as Sir Ridley Scott's mother-ship we see in Alien (1979) or complex as Daiana Win Jônzu's house with legs in Studio Ghibli's Howl's Moving Castle (2004) but Moon is centred not on aesthetics and wonderment but inner sanctum.The wonderful tone here taps into the subject of isolation and a slow uncertain doubt that brings on the traits of a lifestyle of living alone for three years and the breakdown of the mind and impending madness. However, all is not what it seems, we know that Sam Bell works for the 'Industry' and that his three year work schedule has just two weeks to finalise, but at the same time his mental state is, strangely, becoming more unstable, more degenerative as this two week wait is coming to its end.To confuse matters still, there is the arrival of a doppelgänger, the walking, talking reflective self that has materialised from thin-air, a second body with identical features, both internally and physically exact. Who is this second Sam Bell? How did he arrive at this moon station? Why is he here? More importantly, why does he look, sound and behave exactly as the first Sam Bell? Probing questions for those who think themselves sane and in control. This, the underlined narrative, is what Moon sets out to achieve, are we truly in control of our destiny, our lives, and more to the point, our own demise? It is with solace that Moon has the answer, from turning away from self-pitying loneliness and turning outward to rejoin the human-race by relying on dedicated alliances of instincts of survival and comradeship. The moon is a dead, soulless satellite, and as metaphors go, it works well, the connection between lunar life and lunar (Luna, Latin for moon) thoughts is a fine line.Reconnecting back to the human-race and denouncing the industrial age and its technologies, and all that it entails, is that binds us, and at worst, bleeds the soul dry of individuality and purpose. This too is the under current of Moon, a small claustrophobic setting set against the vastness of the human spirit. To survive. To live. To be human. This blurring of the soul into a Fritz Lang Metropolis (1927) with man and machine, George Orwell's 'Animal Farm' of man and pigs and Steven Spielberg's reworking of the Carlo Collodi's classic Pinocchio fable with Artificial Intelligence: AI (2001), where puppet instinctively knows the difference between controlled actions and free will shows that the eroding self from conformity and complacency can, in time, do irreversible damage. Moon shows the positive aspects of life, even in the darkest, furthest regions of space, mind, body and soul.",6,2,5,3 September 2009
Valkyrie," I will give them this: They certainly knew how to (over) throw a party.
","We all know that film, in general, has its target audience to appeal to, but what I really do find interesting concerning Valkyrie is that with the twenty or so people in this particular cinema screening a large proportion here were aged above sixty-five years of age. It seems that this, Valkyrie, appeals to a larger spectrum of age, albeit for reasons known to only the individual cinemagoer: Star-name, action, drama, historical value et al. It seems apparent that this movie has far more reaching appeal than first appears. Here we have a film that centres on the attempted murder of Adolf Hitler during the latter part of WWII by his own Officers'. While Bryan Singers's film takes its part in this niche of German history, this film does not really carry itself in the manner of a war film but gives an air of historical drama.This too would apply to the supporting cast. With the international feel of an American Cruise (Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg), the British Branagh (Major-General Henning von Tresckow), Nighy (General Friedrich Olbricht), Wilkinson (General Friedrich Fromm), Stamp (Ludwig Beck) and Izzard (General Erich Fellgiebel) then there is the German Democratic Republican Kretschmann (Major Otto Ernst Remer), who, when called upon, give fine, strong and respectable performances'. Even with this flavour, the focal point is strongly on the resistance of these German Officers'. The Soldier takes on the might of the domestic germ of Hitler's right hand men, repelling Hitler's German National Socialist Party black shirted members': the Nazis and his S.S. personal bodyguards' (the paramilitary organization founded in 1925 who administrated the use of the Death Camp) and their dishonourable actions which have brought upon the face of Germany through their genocides and methods of control shame, disgust and revulsion.Here we have Germanys best, Germanys fighting men, men who have known at first hand the honour of the battlefield and what it is to make sacrifice for a willing cause, Bryan Singer has given us an interpretation into the birth, life and death of the 20 July plot of 1944. Putting names to faces, even those faces and locations here seen only for a brief, but important, moment, such as Berlins Police Chief Wolf-Heinrich von Helldorfq and the actual Bendlerstrasse (Bendlerblock) building, used as place of execution of the conspirators.Both Mr. Singer and Mr. Newton Thomas Sigel (cinematographer) gives Operation Walküre (the use of Germanys Reserve Army (Heer), who at a time of national unrest, of any description, would be awoken to quash any sign of rebellion or unrest) an arena of a keen sense of drama and tension. Plotting the death of Adolf Hitler is no after thought. We see a tight band of top ranking Officers believing in a just course, any doubt, and fear, here is reflected in the eyes of those who try to better Germany, and visualising this is only second best to the fraught realities and dangers that we see these men re- enact. There is simply no room for complacency. The risk is too high. Failure is not an option. The pace is set.The authenticity of its environment in which we are given a firsthand account is both charming in its uses of deep focus and a feeling of depth and perspective for the eye to muster gives the particular subjects' here the demeanour of what these men symbolises in both prestige and heritage and the scope and goals for all concerned.Valkyrie is a tale of pride and honour. We shall possibly never know the real men involved here: their politics, their beliefs, their traits and as the parting of the wave of time may have been distorted or lost forever, it feels and looks all the part an historical document that may be taken with a light pinch of salt and enjoyed for what it is. An exposé of the men who once tried and failed in their part to target, to slay the beast and to finally bring peace to Europe. A fitting stance that, seemingly, appeals to all spectrum's' ages to appreciate, understand and respect.",5,4,7,29 January 2009
