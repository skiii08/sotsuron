50 First Dates," I THINK THIS FILM WAS FANTASTIC
","Me and my sister went to see 50 First Dates and i thought it was fantastic, i love adam sandler and i cant understand why his films never get a very good rating here in England, I couldnt wait to see this film and i wasnt dissapointed, i'll certainly be adding this to my Adam Sandler collection when it comes out to buy. Drew Barrymore plays the part of Lucy brilliantly and i think the pair of them are great together in films, the wedding singer was great and i hope they do more films together. There are lots of funny moments in this film including Lucy's brother. Sean Astin played this part brilliantly and Dan Akroyd as the doctor was good too especially his comment about the largest mammal ( i almost choked on my drink laughing at that one.) If you are a big Adam Sandler fan like me then this film will not dissapoint you.",Null,0,0,17 April 2004
