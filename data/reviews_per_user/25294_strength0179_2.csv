Iron Man 3," what a piece crapppppp!!! (spoiler... a little...)
","Yeah!! I think this movie is crap...even a little boring.'We made our own enemy.' ??? I know this...sounds familiar... oh yeah... Iron Man 2!! Why Ivan Vanko create his own machine? The answer is 'to take revenge from the Stak!!!' The Stark made their own enemy!!!!!!!! So the whole idea about the story is a recycle. But not just recycle, it is a variety show! When Ivan Vanko activated his machine first time in 'Iron Man 2', I hold my breath... all my mind was the idea like 'Holy Crap!! Things are going down!!!' ....... That experience never happen again...No!! I just see Tonny and his machine keep being a fool...again, again, and again. (And those fool kick a lot of bad ass.) Making fun is good, but not good enough!! The worst party, this story is not about how Tonny Stark be a better man/hero. It is just about how Tonny Stark fit into Pepper Potts's demand! Like all the chick-flick film!! 'Don't hang around with my ex-girl friend.' 'Sorry. It is all my fault.' 'You don't like what I am busy with... OK! Let them become firework!!(And the firework is so powerful to kill super soldier.)' A film budget more than 10000000 $...should get a better story.",3,43,85,24 April 2013
Man of Steel," Strange movie...
","I use this word 'strange.' Only because it is really strange.The fighting was disappointed. 'Hancock' is much better. At least I know what they was doing. But in this film, 50% you can only tell they are jumping, flying, crashing, causing explode... last time I see a movie fight like this was 'transformer.' Some people may be entertained by the long-term violence emotion. But that shouldn't be The story was not great. Too much political correctness. (Almost every Zack Snyder's film is too much political correctness. But this one break the record.) And not just political correctness, it is American political correctness. Don't tell me it is an American movie. There is a line between OK and NO.",Null,34,228,12 June 2013
