Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Who Framed Roger Rabbit
","In many ways Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a homage to animation. It's filled with references to numerous iconic cartoons, and many famous characters make appearances: Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Donald Duck, Jessica Rabbit, Mickey and Minnie, Dumbo, and a number of others, though admittedly some of their voice work felt a little off.The film also plays with a lot of the conventions found in cartoons. Sight gags, slapstick, cartoon violence, and one-liners that fall somewhere between witty and campy.Who Framed Roger Rabbit has fun with it subject matter, reveling in what it is—a zany cartoon noir comedy with memorable characters There's the lovable Roger Rabbit (Charles Fleischer), the pessimistic private eye Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins), and the movie's antagonist Judge Doom (in a big change of pace from Back to the Future's likable Doc, Christopher Lloyd). Judge Doom's job description apparently includes jury and executioner as well. All the while I was wondering why Roger couldn't at least get a trial, but I guess L.A. doesn't bother with such trivialities in this universe. Doom has a squad of thugs at his disposal, several gum shoe-accented weasels wearing double-breasted suits and fedoras.I understand that combining live action with animation was groundbreaking when this came out, and in fact the movie won a special achievement Oscar for it, but it's hard to be impressed in the era of Pixar. Today it all comes off as a little dated, but I suppose it doesn't hurt for nostalgia's sake.",7,0,1,19 April 2010
The English Patient," The English Patient (1996)
","Though the plane crash at the start was a great opening and very enthralling, I couldn't say the same of the next hour or so. I was thoroughly bored for about the first 90 minutes of the movie, so much so that it took me three separate viewings to get to the 90 minute mark. However, once things kick into high gear (well, not really, but compared to the first half of the movie), I was enthralled. From David's unfortunate fate in the torture room to Clifton's death wish vengefulness to Katherine's ultimate fate, the movie really drew me in. And Ralph Fiennes proves yet again he is one of the best actors working today, and likely one of the best in cinematic history. I try not to use hyperbole, but I think it's justified here. The movie evoked memories of a number of great films, movies like Lawrence of Arabia and Raiders of the Lost Ark. It too achieved the epicness we often associate with them. And while I'm not sure it deserved the nine Oscars it won, well, it probably deserved a few. The first half was painfully slow, but the end makes up for it. And then some. A very strong 7.5/10",7,0,1,10 October 2008
Public Enemies," Borderline Great
","It's right on the cusp of greatness; a couple moments lean towards merely good, others topple over into the realm of near perfection. The killing of Dillinger outside the theater and the second jail break, especially the intense 'c'mon, turn green!' stop light scene exemplified the latter. The score and choice in soundtrack weren't bad, either. Michael Mann was certainly ambitious in this project. Sets, costumes, even dialect seemed to be meticulously planned and executed. The scope is vast. The performances are solid. Everything is there for it to be an excellent movie, but what keeps much of the film from greatness is a combination of one dimensional characters, an attempt by the film to be some sort of overly long, somewhat slow masterpiece a la Once Upon a Time in America, and the occasionally drab photography. What drove Dillinger? Who was he? What made him tick? These questions aren't satisfactorily answered in the film. Depp does a commendable job, but we only ever see his one-note exterior. Purvis is similarly one dimensional, seemingly just there to be the yin to Dillinger's yang. I feel Mann did a better job of fleshing out cop and crook in his magnum opus Heat; the characters here feel just somehow more generic. Props to Crudup, however—he is a great J. Edgar Hoover. The movie clocks in at 2 hours and 20 minutes. I've got no problem with a longer running time, in fact it's more for your money, but the movie just could have been a little more punchy. Think The Departed. As it is, I just feel the movie drags sometimes. Mann appears to be one of the biggest directors leading the charge to Digital. I've never had anything against it, in fact I thought it was used to excellent effect in both Collateral and Miami Vice. And while there are some good visuals in Public Enemies, there are other moments of washed out, drab photography. One of the biggest distractions for me was the motion blur, often indicative of HD during pans. Some of the hand-held camera-work seemed out of place, as well. And I've heard others criticize DV's use here simply because it's a period piece, and the two don't seem to belong in the same room together. Whatever it was, Mann might have done well to revert back to film for this one. I don't mean to go on about the negative. In fact, it's a credit to the movie that it's limited to these three things. I might be biased because it was partially shot in my home state and I was fortunate enough to work on set for a day, but I think when all is said and done it's a genuinely good film. Maybe even great.",8,2,5,2 July 2009
The Great Dictator," The Great Dictator
","The Great Dictator succeeds brilliantly on two different levels. First, it works as a comedy, even by today's standards. Second, and more importantly, it was a brave and ahead of its time condemnation of Nazi Germany.Chaplin has been called the master of slapstick, and The Great Dictator doesn't disappoint in the comedy department. Take the opening World War I battle. Chaplin finds himself wandering through smoke until he finally comes out alongside other soldiers. But wait, these are enemy soldiers. Chaplin drops his gun, exclaims, 'Pardon me!' and runs away. Or when he makes his escape with Schutlz and their plane is inadvertently rolled upside down. Chaplin observes his watch dangling up and nonchalantly comments, 'We seem to be defying the laws of gravity.'But what has truly made The Great Dictator so timeless was its scathing criticism of Nazi Germany. The movie began production in the late 1930's while the US was still at peace with Hitler, and in fact it was released more than a year before the US entered the war. Condemning Nazism was taboo, and Chaplin, a Jew himself, was only able to make the movie because of creative and financial independence. In fact, Chaplin put $1.5 million of his own money into the project, and this was at a time when it couldn't be shown in some places due to 'neutrality.' Needless to say the film didn't have the best box office prospects, but that only stands as a testament to Chaplin, a man more interested in artistic expression and fighting injustice than the bottom line.Modern studios should take note; it became Chaplin's highest grossing film.8.5/10",8,1,2,15 December 2009
The Hateful Eight," Not His Best, but Solid
","Got to see Tarantino's The Hateful Eight today in 70mm! For the uninitiated, most movies are, or rather were, shot with 35mm. However, the trend today is overwhelmingly becoming digital photography, which can be effective but is also inundating modern cinema with depressingly blurry camera pans and other adverse effects. Anyway, Tarantino's film was shot with 65mm film (the extra 5mm comes from the accompanying audio track), and the difference between 35mm and 65mm is like 720p vs. 4k; significantly higher image quality and resolution.To get the full experience, you'd want to see it projected through an actual 70mm film projector. This is easier said than done since the cost of getting the proper equipment reportedly runs $80,000 per auditorium. To that end, the Weinstein Company has helped outfit a handful of theaters around the country with said equipment, and if you want a truly premium experience I encourage you to seek one out. There's at least one theater in most major cities.However, as admirable as this audacious Roadshow is, I question Tarantino's choice of movie to do it with. On paper a Western sounds great to shoot with 70mm film; vast landscapes, grizzled faces, close-ups of holstered pistols with clenched hands around their grips Unfortunately, most of The Hateful Eight takes place in a relatively small and dim interior. The movie looks nice, but not nearly as good as it would've with outside daylight bringing out every crisp detail. The contrast seemed a touch high, as well. I'm thinking of one shot in particular of a stagecoach moving alongside a stream outside. The snow is very white, and the stagecoach is very dark. Not much middle ground. I hate to say it but I'm looking forward to The Revenant's cinematography more now.Tarantino's well known for his dialogue, and it doesn't let down here. I'm not sure it was intentional, but at one point several characters are accused of wrongdoing. I noticed two of the three were actors that came under suspicion from Tarantino for leaking his script of The Hateful Eight early. Very quickly I started noting parallels between the characters' defenses and the actors' real life defenses when accused of the script leak. Maybe it's coincidence, but that added some fascinating depth to the scene for me.Direction is top notch too, and even at 3 hours the movie doesn't get boring. Maybe slow in some spots, but never boring. That being said, the story itself isn't particularly compelling or amazing. There's a very 'whodunit' feel to the whole affair, with a sense of mystery evoking And Then There Were None or maybe The Thing. The buildup is better than the underwhelming payoff, sadly, but it's by no means unsatisfying.Performances make up for story shortcomings. Kurt Russell, Walton Goggins (glad to see him getting some bigger roles after Justified), Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Roth, and even Channing Tatum are all in top form. I was happy to see Zoë Bell get a small part too. Michael Madsen just recycles his old performances, however, but he was the only low point among the otherwise terrific ensemble cast. Similarly, Morricone lends his talents to great effect. It's not The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, but it's still a solid mix between The Untouchables and Two Mules for Sister Sara.This isn't Tarantino's best movie, but it's probably one of my favorite 2015 releases alongside Mad Max, Ex Machina, Rogue Nation, and Sicario. I'd put it ahead of Death Proof and Jackie Brown, and about on par with Reservoir Dogs. Do yourself a favor and seek out one of the 70mm Roadshow locations if possible. It wouldn't be the end of the world to see it on a digital projector, but the image quality will degrade somewhat and you'll lose a big part of what makes the experience special.8/10",8,13,48,30 December 2015
Knowing," Knowing: Grandeur That Transcends the Scope of its Own Story
","SpoilersI went to Knowing for two reasons. My man Ebert, who I've only disagreed with three times to date, gave it 4 stars. Second, any movie with enough money poured into it is bound to have some redeeming qualities. But keeping the bad buzz in mind, I went with low expectations. It started off decently enough. Intrigue was essential in building interest. Still, I'd heard it went downhill, especially in the third act, so I didn't get my hopes up. Enter the first catastrophe. Holy hell. The CGI was noticeable, but I didn't care. The screeching hurt my ears, but it was warranted and in my opinion worth it for the effect. The plane careens into the highway, skidding along the ground and bursting into flames. My heart sank; I've studied numerous aviation disasters, but none, even as depicted in other movies, even actual footage, felt as close or as real as this. In the same shot, the camera chases behind a distraught Nicolas Cage racing through the wreckage in a meager attempt to help any survivors he comes across. It was downright chilling. Now that we know there's credence to the prophecy, the movie takes on an almost sickening atmosphere of tension. What will the next disaster involve? How many lives will be lost? How horrific will it be? Cage attempts to stop it, but in the end he is unable. The last catastrophe looms. It's different. No location is given; no number of deaths told. Slowly but surely our suspicions are confirmed - the apocalypse is upon us. I'll get back to this. Throughout the movie we see more and more of some seriously creepy albino guys. They seem almost supernatural, omniscient, uncaring. They are an element of the plot that comes into play towards the end of the film, and be warned I'm going to go into an in-depth analysis of this plot point, so take heed if you haven't seen the film. They are angels. They guide the film's characters towards their respective destinies. When the world is on the brink of the end, they shepherd the movie's two children into an escape pod of sorts, an 'ark'; watching Cage reluctantly accept his son's fate is gut wrenching and touching. The children are each holding a white rabbit. I'm not sure if there's a Biblical connotation there, but at the very least I took it to mean innocence and fertility. The end of the world is vastly significant in its own right, a big enough event to really invest your emotions into, but when you throw into the mix the theological overtones present at this point in the film, I couldn't help but be overwhelmed. I think this might be where the movie loses people. I admit I'm Christian, so maybe the movie held some inherent significance for me that it doesn't for others. That, and I had heard something about angels before going in, and I wonder if some who hadn't felt the religious development was out of left field. If God's not your thing, power to you. But maybe the movie can still be enjoyed with a grain of salt; it is fiction, after all. Cue the end of the world. Cage has gone to his parents' home to be with his sister, mother, and father who he'd recently reconciled with. The apocalypse is upon us. Fires burn in the city, panicked citizens are looting. I'd imagine this wouldn't be too far off from what it would look like if the world really was about to end. The cause of humanity's demise is explained on a scientific basis in the film - it doesn't just randomly happen - though I'm unsure of the scientific validity of the explanation. To the best of my knowledge the cause is next to impossible for the foreseeable future, but it was nice to know that it was at least somewhat grounded in scientific reality. The visuals are stunning; fire engulfs the globe. It almost looks as if a large nuke has been detonated in semi-slow motion in New York City, one where the fireball doesn't seem to have any intention of stopping. A shot of the globe shows what appeared to be a hauntingly beautiful visual of the atmosphere leaving the planet as it turns to rubble. Everything is obliterated. And then, in one of the most grand examples of a story coming full circle I've ever seen, the children are dropped off, with a number of other arks seen landing in the distance, on a picturesque, unspoiled, virgin world to start again; they are in the Garden of Eden.",9,3,8,24 March 2009
The Exorcist," Not Scary, But Still Pretty Good
","The Exorcist was one of those famous movies I had heard about all my life but never seen. A lot of people called it the definitive horror movie. Netflix claims, 'If this horror classic doesn't terrify you, maybe you need a shrink.' Maybe I do. I didn't find the movie particularly scary, though I know it gained its reputation almost immediately upon release. A video on YouTube even shows crowd reactions from the audiences of 1973. A theater usher goes so far as to describe how 'as soon as they faint, I get out the smelling salts.' Another theater patron proclaims she's 'not going back in there.' This huge rift in reaction can only be attributed to the desensitization of modern audiences. I actually saw Paranormal Activity the same day as The Exorcist and the former was easily the scarier of the two. Nonetheless, both films are miles ahead of the gory slasher flicks that masquerade as horror these days. I'm not criticizing The Exorcist. While it's true the horror aspects are somewhat tame by today's standards, the film still excels in a number of ways. Take for example the intriguing verbal sparring match between the demon and Karras. The priest interrogates the demon, trying to find if this is an actual possession or a simple case of mental illness. The demon states it is Satan himself, a claim designed to fool Karras into thinking the latter, as Satan doesn't possess humans. The demon also attempts to torment Karras by claiming his recently deceased mother is being sodomized in hell; he responds that if it's true, the demon should be able to produce his mother's maiden name. He cannot. The Exorcist boasts a memorable theme, characters that were well played and worthy of emotional investment, and a climax brimming with tension. It's not the scariest movie ever made as some might claim, but I won't fault the movie for that. Even without being scary it succeeds brilliantly. 8/10",8,0,1,16 November 2009
Duck You Sucker," A Fistful of Leone
","Legendary director Sergio Leone made one final Western following the success of Once Upon a Time in the West and the Dollars Trilogy, and while it doesn't stack up to the monumental greatness of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, it remains a noble effort and solid film. Where the movie fails to meet the grandeur of its predecessor is in the scope of its execution. The score doesn't quite match Morricone's magnum opus. The characters aren't quite as colorful as Blondie, Tuco, or Angel Eyes. The battle doesn't quite have the magnitude of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly's. But these are minor criticisms if they can be called criticisms at all. Duck, You Sucker! is easily identified as a Leone movie by the many elements found in his other work: gritty close-ups, sun-baked deserts, even a bridge explosion not at all unlike the Civil War battle's conclusion in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. But what differs this time around is the replacement of Eastwood with a new anti-hero, Mexican bandit Juan Miranda (Rod Steiger). Co-protagonist John Mallory (James Coburn) serves as an effective foil, a noble-minded revolutionary working alongside local guerrillas to create a better Mexico. There is something to be said for the pair's chemistry, and in many ways they're similar to Blondie and Tuco. As with the Dollars Trilogy, Leone paints a beautiful film on his celluloid canvas. The aesthetic has a gritty, epic feel, and as always the most is made of the Southwest's (Spain's) grand, majestic, sweeping landscape. What really sets the film apart is Morricone's score. The man is legendary in his own right, but the Leone / Morricone duo is nearly beyond superlative. Any time the two come together there is the potential for a masterpiece. And while Duck, You Sucker! doesn't quite attain such a status, it has repeatedly, and deservedly, been called one of the best Spaghetti Westerns. 7.5/10",7,1,3,19 October 2009
Paranormal Activity," A Horror Film That Doesn't Suck
","I don't care for the horror genre. It's never really appealed to me, the movies tend to use cheap scare tactics, and they're often riddled with clichés. Maybe it's why I usually enjoy comedy horror like Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland; they're almost self-mocking, acknowledging what they are and spoofing the genre. That's why I'm impressed by Paranormal Activity. It's a serious horror film, with a clear intent to frighten you, and it actually works. No clichés, no cheap scares, no excessive gore. Instead the film employs ambient crescendos that evoke dread and tension, minimal but effective effects, and realistic, sympathetic characters stuck in a hellish downward spiral. The film was made for a meager $15,000, and it shows, but it might be better for it. Many have drawn a comparison between this and The Blair Witch Project, and while I haven't seen the latter, like its predecessor Paranormal Activity has at least turned out to be a major indie success story. And I'm glad, it deserves it. 8.5/10",8,2,6,18 October 2009
Avatar," The Best Movie of 2009
","I wanted to see this in 3D as it was intended, but unfortunately the people I was going with just wanted to see it in 2D. Not all was lost, however, as the screen I saw it on was a large 70 X 30' screen. It had golden curtains that were pulled back prior to the movie starting, and the manager who introduced the film beforehand boasted that this was the largest screen in Arizona. I'm not entirely sure if that's true, what with there being IMAX's in the area and all, but I'll admit it was an impressive auditorium. Several trailers played beforehand. The first was a great looking action comedy starring Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz called Knight and Day. Bad title, but it's now my second most anticipated movie of 2010, behind The Expendables. There were also trailers for Clash of the Titans, Salt, and one or two others I can't recall. Alright, now for the actual movie. I was extremely impressed. And since I only saw it in 2D, I didn't even see the biggest part of what makes this film so special. That will change next week when I see it in IMAX 3D, but for now it's a tribute to the film's story, a rousing and compelling tale that doesn't rely on gimmicky 3D, only adds it as a bonus. We all have an idea of the story by now, and some call it unoriginal, clichéd, etc. Being a remake of Infernal Affairs, you could say the same of The Departed, but like Ebert pointed out in his review of it, 'a movie is not about what it's about; it's about how it's about it.' This certainly applies to Avatar as well; it might be a retread of familiar stories like FernGully and Dances with Wolves, but it's just told - and shown - so well that it doesn't matter in the slightest. Credit to the actors for making the story as good as it is. Sam Worthington is solid, as are Sigourney Weaver and Giovanni Ribisi, but the two people who really steal the show are Stephen Lang and Zoe Saldana. Lang is the perfect antagonist for the movie, a real evil hardass we love to hate. And Saldana... You'll remember her as Uhura from Star Trek. She plays Neytiri, the Na'vi female interest Worthington falls for as he comes to know the alien race. Saldana plays her as strong and fierce, but full of emotion as well. We can thank her for a lot of the emotional heavy lifting in Avatar - tragic events wouldn't be what they are without her gut wrenching reactions. I'm unable to comment on the 3D, but the other effects were terrific. I had considered Terminator 3 to be the benchmark for CGI up until about 2007, at which point Transformers set the bar, but now it's Avatar. Pandora is photorealistic, plain and simple. I'd hesitate to say the same for the Na'vi, but they're close. To be fair, we've seen effects this good before, but what sets Avatar apart is the sheer magnitude of it all - we've seen great CGI but never to this extent. Cameron also makes effective use of motion capture, the same technology Peter Jackson used for Gollum in the LOTR trilogy and King Kong. I couldn't tell if he ever used models, but that's to the credit of the movie. After all, Cameron's goal was for us to be unable to differentiate between what was real and what wasn't. And he succeeds. All in all, Avatar is a rousing, exciting, action/adventure epic, and I can't wait to see it again in IMAX 3D. This is the best movie of 2009. 9.5/10",9,2,6,18 December 2009
Invictus," An Important Film
","It's interesting how well Eastwood balances political prisoner turned president Nelson Mandela with, of all things, rugby in his latest masterpiece. The biopic chronicles Mandela's rise to power and his efforts to unite South Africans, black and white alike, behind the national rugby team. It wasn't a political calculation, it was a human one. Freeman absolutely disappears into his role as the iconic leader of post-Apartheid South Africa. This is an especially impressive feat for such a well known actor; it's not Morgan Freeman we're watching, it's Mandela. Damon does a good job as well. And while I'm no expert on accents, both sounded convincing to me. The story is inspiring, absolutely inspiring. It's 1994, and blacks are granted the right to vote; Mandela is swept into office. Blacks are ecstatic, whites are fearful. How does Mandela overcome the hateful rift within the population? Rugby, of course. Mandela figures that if the South African rugby team can win the World Cup, the country will have something to rally behind as one. What makes Invictus truly great is the universal truth found within its story. Sure, the end of Apartheid and South Africa's bright looking future make for a compelling story, but why stop there when you can make a powerful statement on what can be accomplished when hate, oppression, and violence end and peace begins. It works wonderfully in the context of the story between black and white, but it could be applied to Bosnian and Serb, Muslim and Jew, Catholic and Protestant, Hutu and Tutsi... Eastwood is on a roll. He's 79, but by God he's just getting started. The man has given us Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby, Flags of Our Fathers, Letters from Iwo Jima, Changeling, Gran Torino, and now Invictus all within six years; five of these movies are on the Top 250, and I have absolute confidence Invictus will make it six. 9/10",9,1,3,11 December 2009
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Creation vs. Destruction
","At its core, The Bridge on the River Kwai is a film about creation and destruction. It alternates between two story lines that start and end in the same place.One revolves around the efforts of British POW's to build a bridge in the middle of a Thai jungle. Despite their hardships and poor living conditions, these men work diligently on a bridge they hope will stand as a monument to British ingenuity and resourcefulness for generations to come. Essentially, it's their way of inflicting defeat on the enemy, even while in the confines of a POW camp. This subplot represents creation.Meanwhile, a British Special Forces team is assembled with one simple task: to destroy the bridge the POW's are creating. Led by an ex-POW who had escaped the camp, the team manages to plant demolitions and explode the bridge as a train with high priority Japanese targets passes on it. These men are the harbingers of destruction.What we're ultimately left with, then, are two inherently opposed forces that come head to head in the film. Traditionally, people associate creation with good and destruction with bad. It becomes less clear in a situation like this. Does the long-term vision of the POW's justify temporarily aiding the Japanese war effort? I don't believe so, and in that regard blowing up the bridge was the right thing to do.So what Bridge on the River Kwai accomplishes is turning traditional preconceptions about destruction upside down. By taking out the bridge and the train on it, the Japanese will be that much closer to surrendering and the war will be that much closer to ending. This will save countless lives and prevent further destruction, so ironically the bridge is blown up in the name of preservation. It's a compelling and fascinating study of the greater good, and that only left me with one lingering question—is preservation not itself a form of creation?9/10",9,1,3,12 December 2009
John Wick: Chapter 2," The Matrix Reloaded to The Matrix
","Very very good, maybe great, but not quite the original. The first was so fresh, and good as this one is the relentless auto-aim headshots get to be fatiguing and monotonous. It's a small complaint but seems to be a common reaction.Stahelski elaborates more on the world created by the first, but some of the universe building comes off as gratuitous or even, oddly enough, mundane. A good example - when we're first introduced to the coins in the last movie, their implications are fascinating. There's a whole currency for this underground world of assassins? How much are they worth? How do you get them? In Chapter 2, there's a brief scene where John approaches Winston as he's inspecting new coins from a man who presumably mints them. Winston says, 'Exquisite work, put them into circulation.' It's a fun nod, but there's something about it that takes away from the world's mythos and turns it into boring matter-of-fact hit-man logistics.The first movie's action mostly took place at night, and the same is true here. But while that was surprisingly clean and crisp visually, I found this entry to have more motion blur. Looking it up, both movies use the Arri Alexa, and I've noticed digital cinematography seems more prone to that problem, but it was just a minor disappointment, minor being the operative word. It's still miles ahead of the 10-cuts-a-second shaky cam epidemic plaguing modern action cinema.Last small complaint. While John Wick suffers from the John McClane 'real but still invincible' action hero dilemma, he's also a superhuman weapons handling expert to a fault. For example, every time Wick reloads and racks his gun, he does a secondary press check to ensure there's a bullet in the chamber. In the middle of a heated and fast paced shootout, this step seems excessive, time consuming, and unnecessary. It looks cool, I guess, but it didn't need to be done every time. A small case of tactical trumping practical.I'm nitpicking. I know that, and the movie was very good. Sometimes it's just easier to list a few things wrong than everything right, and there is a lot right here. It's not the masterpiece the original was, and ends on a maddeningly inconclusive cliffhanger, but it absolutely beats out 98% of action movies from the last decade.John Wick - 9.5/10 John Wick: Chapter 2 - 8/10",8,8,16,10 February 2017
Law Abiding Citizen," Law Abiding Citizen (2009)
","The movie opens on two burglars violently breaking into Gerard Butler's home, raping his wife, and killing her and their child. Butler's out for blood, but up and coming prosecutor Jamie Foxx is more concerned with keeping his 96% conviction rate going than administering justice to both robbers. He makes a deal with one of the burglars to turn over on the other; one gets the death penalty, one a minor sentence. Butler's devastated. Fast forward 10 years. Butler goes on a bloody rampage, dishing out his own vigilante brand of justice, first with the two robbers, then moving on to those in the justice system he holds responsible. Foxx, now a major player in the justice system, quickly realizes he's behind it all. After being arrested and locked up, Butler still somehow manages to manipulate outside events, causing a number of further deaths. Foxx is puzzled but determined. What ensues is a mysterious and gritty revenge story. As the death toll rises, Foxx comes closer to figuring it all out, but Butler always seems to be one step ahead. By the end the audience is allowed access to Butler's secret. Ebert said in his review it was something of a let down, but given the 10 years Butler had to plan his revenge, it didn't require that much suspension of disbelief. Where the movie falters is in the lesson Butler attempts to teach. He's a little like John Doe in Se7en, preaching a bloody and violent sermon. But unlike Doe, we're supposed to sympathize with Butler, and despite his hardships I don't think his message was necessarily true, let alone able to justify the body count. Law Abiding Citizen is still a good thriller. I enjoyed it. If nothing else, it at least delivers what it promises. 7/10",7,0,2,18 October 2009
