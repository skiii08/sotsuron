Hereditary," What an amazing cult supernatural horror
","Can you choose what to inherit from your parents & can you choose what to pass on to your child? Was it ever our decision to begin with? Hereditary dealt with the manipulation of emotionally fragiled souls as unwilling participants in a horrific & 'luciferous' game. Hereditary is a slow burn psychological and supernatural horror and if you are into cheapskate jump scares movies (eg: The Conjuring, Insidious, etc),then this movie is definitely not for you. Skip it. Unlike other horror movies, it didn't make me scream at all. But my body felt strap to the chair, eyes were locked facing the screen, as it was dissolving my mental, piece by piece. It's a weird and heavy movie. Thus, I guarantee you that this movie will leave you a quite deep impact as you need to digest all the elements portrayed throughout the entire movie and eventually solve the complex puzzle of Hereditary.",8,1,2,30 June 2018
