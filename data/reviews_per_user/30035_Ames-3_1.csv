The Legend of Bagger Vance," Beautiful picture
","In typical Robert Redford fashion, you can feel what the characters feel, but most of all, the direction and scenery in this movie is fabulous. I don't care that much for golf, but you sure do love it in this movie. Excellent acting! Go see it!",9,0,1,13 November 2000
