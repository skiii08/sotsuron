The Expendables 2," Action At Its Best
","Please all you haters. You knew what the movie was going to be. Why bother to go see it and then post a negative review here. I have a poser friend who went to the movies last Saturday, bypassed all the blockbusters to watch a small time Brit flick with a total of 6 people in the room. Please review a film with an open mind. Expendables 2 for an Oscar, I think not. But for a couple of hours of first class entertainment from the action stars we have followed for years, YES YES YES. I could't wait for the first, I loved the second and of course am awaiting the third with baiting breath. Half the fun is just to see who will be in it. This second installment is better than the first and Van Damme makes a terrific villain. If you like action films and love seeing all these icons on one screen, then this is it. If of course you are a poser and only watch films that you do not understand and are recommended by the 'experts' enjoy your movie with the 6 other people but please do not badly preview a film that is not your genre and spoil it for true fans. This movie has 400 reviews and I know what most say.",9,3,4,22 April 2013
American Hustle," Great Acting - Terrible Movie.
","Just saw this tonight on New Years Eve here in Brisbane Australia. I saw where one reviewer said they considered leaving after 45 minutes. If I had not been with friends I would have left after half an hour. As it was (to my envy) some people actually left around the hour mark. I only went to see this because of Oscar talk and reviews. The acting was brilliant, but let down by a slow moving, uninspiring story line with very little plots or twists. In fact I felt some overacting from the cast in trying to save this movie. My friends also felt very disappointed after hearing the hype. No way is this movie Oscar worthy but as an actor Jennifer Lawrence could get a nod.",3,14,26,31 December 2013
