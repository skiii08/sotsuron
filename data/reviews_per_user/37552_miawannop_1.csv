","Wow, I went into this film knowing that so far it has had very good reviews and I have to say that I was not in the least bit disappointed. In fact I was very impressed by this film for how close it was to the book.Now going into this film I had previously read the book about two weeks prior so it was still fresh in my mind and the book is an absolute masterpiece! Now I never expected a 1000 page book to ever get every detail put into a film because that is nearly impossible but this film handled the job very well and for that I commend it.Now the film of course starts off with Georgie and his yellow slicker, I didn't know what to expect from this scene where we are first introduced to Pennywise in the drain with the boat but I have to say it was bloody terrifying! This was how I knew that the film was not going to stray far from the books gruesome details as Pennywise was immediately opened by ripping Georgie's arm right from its socket. This was petrifying, especially in an extremely dark cinema.Now perhaps there were maybe a few too many jump scares as the film didn't really need to add them for effect as it was extremely scary without because of Pennywise. Bill Skarsgard is the perfect Pennywise, there is absolutely no doubt about that and he is what really makes this film amazing. But also the kids who were played so so well and fit the characters so so well. Honestly this film is one of the best I have ever seen in my entire life!Did it include all of the details from the book? No, but did you really expect it to, King is a very in depth writer and the film was handled absolutely perfectly in my opinion with just the right amount of humour and more than enough terror.",10,7,18,8 September 2017
