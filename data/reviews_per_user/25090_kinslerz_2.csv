Scarface," Electrifying
","Scarface was an unpredictable, very 'in your face' mob thriller. From the very beginning you dive head first into Al Pacino's character, Tony Montana. You learn in the first five minutes how Tony presents himself, with conviction and with a firm personality. He has very few soft spots, and gaining Tony's trust is an unattainable goal. Tony always had one major exposed nerve which led viewers to predict foreshadowing. Don't worry, I'm not about to write a spoiler. Each character in the movie had their own electrifying personality and their own sub-plots and certain (un)predictable spins. With dialogue that makes your head spin, a few far fetched details, and a captivating plot; you're in for a true treat with this 1983 De Palma film.",10,0,2,1 July 2011
Man on the Moon," He was so much more than an entertainer.
","In this 99' Milos Forman film, audiences get to experience a more peaceful character portrayed by Carrey, but equally(or more so) as colorful. Carrey plays Andy Kaufman, who throughout the film is constantly acting on his distinctive ideas to entertain the people around him. At the time the idea of being so clueless that you're making people laugh, was unheard of. People didn't usually like to be put into awkward positions, however Andy had this almost childlike trait that made people feel as if he was in fact a child at heart, at times. Andy is constantly putting peoples emotions at risk to get a real reaction and in some cases give people emotion that(even if it's a gloomy emotion) these 'victims' needed to feel to achieve a greater sense of humor or a more manifest view on what is important and what is needed to successfully execute your own life. He was so much more than an entertainer.",10,0,0,22 June 2011
