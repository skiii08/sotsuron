Frost_Nixon," Nixon Got the US out of Vietnam and our POWs back
","Nixon got the US out of Johnson's Vietnam War and got 2/3rds of our POW/MIAs back out of North Vietnam.
That covers a Lot of Sins...........!!
Nixon should never have been Impeached as he was an effective President.
The Frost interview was years later; when Nixon needed some money.......
so; essentially, he was paid to say whatever Frost wanted.
If Frost wanted to do a good interview........
he should interview the people who knew Neville Chamberlain......the LIberal who negotiated 'Peace In Our time' with Adolf Hitler....before Adolf started World War II.....!!??
Langella was MIss-cast in this Movie and Sheen has done nothing else worthwhile since......",1,0,3,14 January 2020
12 Monkeys," Great Science Fiction...Maybe happening now with the Chinese
","Bruce Willis is sent back in time to find the cure for the Plague.
Madeline Stowe is a Psychologist who interacts with him.
Brad Pitt is the Crazy leader of a gang
who sets off the Plague from his father's lab......",10,1,3,26 January 2020
Closer," Natalie Portman is Gorgeous
","Natalie Portman is Gorgeous as the Stripper.......
and her 'nude' scenes should have been left in the picture......
Why shoot something if you are not going to use it......!!??
Otherwise the picture is a waste of time......!!",6,1,2,17 December 2019
Forrest Gump," What was the Actual Purpose of the Movie.!?
","Evidently part of the mileau of making Fun or Critisizing Vietnam Veterans as 'Baby Killers'.....!!
Forrest Gump is a Vietnam Veteran of Low IQ...!!
Are they trying to say All Vietnam Veterans were....??
Uses the Usual Cliches about the war; so provides nothing new.
One might as well make a movie Critical of the Korean War.....!!??
The movie should rate Less than one star;
but gets credit for Gary Sinese and his Lt. Dan Band who entertains the troops in the current war zones and flys veterans kids to Disney World.",1,0,5,2 January 2020
Cast Away," Boring Movie
","A Boring movie created; I imagine, because Hanks and other people Needed a Paycheck at the time.
A man's plane crashes into the Pacific. He washes up on an island and is marooned there.
He paints a soccer ball; he found in a Spaulding box; with a Face so he will have something to talk to.......
But I think this part is ridiculous and wouldn't have been done in real life. a person would more likely have found some way to play ball with the ball......like Steve McQueen in the cooler with the baseball in the great escape.Joe Versus the Volcano is a much better film. This one is a waste of time.",1,1,11,30 December 2019
No Country for Old Men," I Wonder Where the Last Man Standing Is.....!?
","A Great Movie. Actually a 10......!
But I give it a 9 because I feel that the character played by Josh Brolin should have survived......!!
It would have made some Great kind of 2nd movie.....somehow......!!
The Sheriff is somewhat of a disappointment as they don't catch anybody; but merely pick up bodies.....!!
Josh shoots a Bighorn; but it doesn't go down right away.....so he has to track it....!
He finds the blood trail of a wounded dog and backtracks that to where there was a gigantic shootout between drug gangs
for some reason........Most guys are dead.....
Then he goes to track the last man standing........and finds him.......
Brolin is the kind of Outdoorsman you would like to meet or talk to....!!",9,0,0,20 November 2019
Saving Private Ryan," An Excellent Depiction of the D-Day Landing for the Troops
","An Excellent Depiction of the D-Day Landing for the Troops.
However; later there is an anomaly in the logic........
The Captain's orders are to retrieve Private Ryan and return him to the rear; in order to save his life, as all his other brothers have been killed in Combat.
This the Captain achieves; but it is more a matter of luck as Ryan survives on his own....!!
When the Captain takes his Squad on the Mission; and they come across a German Radar installation; he insists on attacking it, instead of going around it.as some of his men suggest.
Attacking it is inconsistent with his orders to retrieve Private Ryan.
In so doing the Captain loses one of his men; and could have lost more.
Later; when he finds Private Ryan; he allows the Private to insist they stay and defend the town from a German attack.
This is also inconsistent with his orders.
If he had survived the attack and Private Ryan had been killed; then the Captain would have been Court Martialed for a Failure to Obey Orders....!!",7,1,2,9 November 2019
1917," Hate to spoil a Good Movie........But......
","I hate to spoil a good movie........But why not just drop coded messages from some planes.....
That way you don't have to use runners......!!??
I actually haven't seen it yet...so I will update the review later.......
However the above was my first thought on seeing rushes of the movie......
The Allies had lots of planes by 1917......!!",10,0,2,23 January 2020
Casualties of War," Made in the Genre of Knocking Vietnam Veterans
","Another movie which should not have been made..........
A fictional account of a situation that Never Happened.......
so that one could claim Vietnam Veterans were crazy or otherwise maladjusted.......or did reprehensible things in the war.......!?",1,1,5,8 January 2020
