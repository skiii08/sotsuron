Blade Runner 2049," Boring
","I don't know how these shills give every movie they watch 10/10.This movie is lacking on every department and doesn't make much sense even from the scientific point of view, a hologram that becomes alive ? give me a brake, the movie is riddled with a bunch of inconsistencies, even the title 2049 ? we are already almost in 2020 and the Earth didn't turn into a wasteland yet, they should at least pushed the events to 2149 or 2249 to give our imagination some room to breed.All in all i'm very disappointed in this movie and gave it 6/10.",6,7,14,11 November 2017
Ready Player One," Foolish movie
","The people that made this movie have no idea whatsoever what gaming is or why people play games, people play games because the experience is interesting to them or because simply they have fun playing games, not because they want to escape reality or avoid real life problems.Although that type of gamer may exist, putting all gamers in the same category is just ignorant and foolish, on top of painting the millions of gamers with the same brush it is none of your business what people do, if they wish to escape reality, its their lives.",3,2,5,4 November 2019
