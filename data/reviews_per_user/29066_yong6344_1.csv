Skyfall," Worse 007 movie, period!
","This movie has prompted me to write my 1st review in IMDb & not in a good way. Absolutely the worse Bond movie & I have watched all of them since Dr No. Lack of exotic locations, gadgets, Daniel C's Bond has 0 charisma, atrocious story line (if there is one) and tons of others. The opening scene is a little decent. Thereafter, everything just went downhill. Daniel C looks old in this movie. This is about the same age that Roger Moore 1st outing as Bond in Live and Let Die. Roger Moore's Bond was way ahead. Cool and suave. Even Sean Connery was better in Never Say Never Again. I know many people repeatedly view the likes of Goldfinger, The Spy who Loves Me, Goldeneye. I actually saw people walked out of the movie half way thru'. Someone in IMDb once wisely said: if they want to make a movie so different, they should use another name. NOT Bond, NOT James Bond. I strongly believe that the initial high score of 8.2 will not be sustainable. It will definitely nosedive soon. Time will tell. Not even worth a rental. Enough said.",1,22,46,5 November 2012
