Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Funny, but a little too raunchy!
","This was a funny movie and a very dirty movie.First I will say that this movie was funny and I don't find it offensive at most parts. Borat, I think shows the true America and how people really think. Thats what I liked about the movie. Most of it was unscripted.Now I will warn everyone that this movie is very crude, raunchy, and dirty. Some people will not like this movie because of how dirty it is. But the crude and raunchy humor did not bother me. What did bother me was the explicit nudity. For example: in the movie you will see a closeup picture of a penis and you will see a very graphic naked fight scene between two men. The nudity is what knocked this film down to an 8 out of 10 for me. The nudity was not need in this film to make it funny.I liked Borat, it was very funny. I thought it had a meaning. I just thought some of the content was a little too excessive.",8,0,4,12 August 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," Amazing Film!
","Pans Labyrinth was simply amazing to me. I had never watched a film with full subtitles before and I didn't know if I was going to like it. But I sure did!!! I just thought that the plot and story was incredible. The film takes place in Spain in 1944. Spain was being ruled by Francisco Franco, a fascist dictator. Ofelia, a little girl, is a stepdaughter to an evil, brutal fascist military captain. Because her birth mother is pregnant with the Captains child, Ofelia and her mother go out and live with the Captain in his military outpost in the far countryside. Ofelia is troubled child. She completely dislikes her stepfather and she is caught in a terrible civil war. Now living on the outpost Ofelia encounters a mythical faun that tells her that she is a princess, but she has to prove herself first. The faun gives her three tasks that she has to complete to become a princess. Ofelia faces danger from the tasks and faces danger from the world she lives in. As the film progresses her mother becomes ill and her stepfather becomes more increasingly violent.The film has two sides. Ofelia has to accomplish her three tasks and in the real world a bloody civil war wages between the fascists and the rebels. Their female servant along with their doctor are also secretly part of the resistance. Ofelia's world along with her military step-dad's world start to crumble. As Ofelia becomes closer to completing her three tasks the world on the outside becomes more unstable and violent. Her stepfather starts to loose control and becomes ever more desperate to crush the rebels. To do so he uses extreme forms of violence and torture.Ofelia's fairy tale world maybe just as violent and dangerous as her real life. Ofelia's tasks test her will and courage. She encounters disgusting, violent, and dangerous situations. The monsters she faces in her fairy tale world are as horrific and as terrible as she faces in the real world. What's more horrifying, a monster trying to eat you or a brutal, sadistic fascist military captain. Ofelia faces two conflicts: the monsters in her three tasks and the monster in the real world who is her stepfather.In the film there is conflicting evidence to tell if everything is in Ofelia's head or is it real. Is the violence that she encounters in her real life affecting her mind to a certain point that she is having out of body experiences. Is she insane? Does she Have a brilliant imagination? Or is this all real? The director makes you wonder.At the end her fairy tale life and her real life collide in a dramatic climax that may sadden you.I will warn you that the violence is very graphic. Probably some of the most graphic violence I have ever seen. But don't let this discourage you. The violent and horrifying scenes are what make this movie so great.Also don't let the subtitles discourage you. After a while you forget that you are even reading. Plus its a poor excuse to miss out on this excellent film.Pan's Labyrinth is a great film. Go rent it!",10,3,7,14 August 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," Great Movie that enlightens me every time I watch!
","I'm not surprised that this film was nominated for best picture. Even though the plot was simple I thought it was engaging. The characters were not really likable at first but you grew into them.Little Miss Sunshine is a story of a very messed up family. The father played by Greg Kinnear, who I thought did a wonderful job, is a winner only type dad. The grandfather, who is very foul mouthed (warning!), is played by Alan Arkin. The grandfather also happens to be a drug addict. The teenage son played by Paul Dano, is confined to himself as he shuts off the rest of the world in hopes of achieving his ultimate goal of being a jet pilot. The uncle, played by Steve Carell, is a depressed homosexual who attempted to commit suicide after his partner left him and he is now living with the rest of the family. The mother(I forget the actress's name) is trying to keep the madness together. And the youngest in the family(played by Abagail Preslin) is the sweet heart with big dreams of becoming a beauty pageant winner.All of the family head out on a road trip to the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. As the family departs they have no true bond with each other. Lets just say that they are not much of a family at first. On their trip outrageous events occur that bring out huge laughs and sadness. Dramatic events occur that change the family and bring them closer together. This is all a build up to the fantastic climax where the whole family unites.A very funny and heart warming movie, but I will warn you that there is some strong language that might catch you off-guard. strong language doesn't usually offend me but in this movie I found it unnecessary.Little Miss Sunshine is a great movie with big laughs at times with very emotional scenes. But the best part about this film is the message displayed at the end. You might not find this the funniest film but I assure you that the ending and message at the end is all worth it to watch.",8,0,3,13 August 2007
Pearl Harbor," 'I think World War Two just started.'
","This line sums up Pearl Harbor.............'I think World War Two just started.'...........this line was said after the attack on Pearl Harbor began in the movie...........nobody started calling the war 'World War 2' until years later.........an atrocious error to say the least.This movie totally missed the point. The film begins way too far in advance and involves too many unnecessary and ridiculous story lines. There is the dreaded love story. Then the main character played by Ben Affleck, who is a pilot, volunteers to fight in Britain for the RAF.....he is shot down and presumed dead. His best friend played by Josh Hartnet, is also a pilot but he stays in Pearl Harbor and then falls in love with Ben Affleck character's girlfriend. But Ben Affleck's character is actually still alive and is rescued and comes back and sees that his best friend has betrayed him and has stolen his girlfriend. Now there's a stupid love triangle that is totally worthless to the real focus of the movie. Its about Pearl Harbor!!!!!!! Next you see the over the top but impressive action sequences of the attack on Pearl Harbor that you have waited over an hour for. When the devastating attack is over you presume the movie is over. But no.....now the movie continues as the men of Pearl Harbor train for the famous Doolittle-raid so they can get their revenge and so America ends as a winner..........what a cheap cop out........the last hour of the film, to say the least, is absolutely irrelevant to the plot and film.Terrible acting and Atrocious script!!!!!!!!!!!I would call this the worst war movie of all time but I cannot consider it a war movie..........Pearl Harbor is just a clich√© tacky film that is targeted toward ignorant and tasteless moviegoers who want to see America always come out as the winner.",2,10,16,25 September 2007
Saving Private Ryan," Visually graphic and disturbing war epic.
","Saving Private Ryan is a WW2 film that begins on the Normandy beaches of France on D-day, June 6th, 1944. The first 20 minutes are the most intense and graphic depictions of war I have seen. The D-day beach assaults will never be recreated so elegantly ever again. The noise, carnage, and chaos overwhelms and deeply disturbs the viewer. Unlike anything I have ever seen.So far through the film you have been following Captain Miller(Tom Hanks) and his company on the beaches of Normandy. After the intense battle the US Army counts its dead. Three brothers were killed on that same day in Normandy. The 4th and youngest brother is James Francis Ryan(Matt Damon), and he is not reported dead but his whereabouts are unknown. Private Ryan is a paratrooper who jumped behind enemy lines as a paratrooper the night before the landings. He is the last of the sons that his mother still has. The army wants him found and brought back home to safety. Captain Miller is now given this task to find Private Ryan and bring him to safety.Captain Miller now travels across battle torn French country side to find Private Ryan. But he does not travel alone. He travels with seven of his own hand picked men from his company. On their journey they face hard struggles. The mission becomes deadly and now the question is why risk the lives of eight men to save the life of one? The men do finally find Private Ryan but Ryan does not want to abandon his fellow comrades who he has been fighting and holding out with. So now Captain Miller and his men stay with Ryan and the troops he has been fighting with in this bombed out town waiting to hold out until relief arrives. The Germans are advancing on the town with many more troops and with tanks. Captain Miller and the rest of the men are vastly outnumbered but are going to try to hold on. What develops is one of the most graphic and disturbing final stands I have ever seen in a war movie.Spielber masterfully directed the battle sequences. The battle scenes attacked your senses. The special effects were mind boggling to say the least. The scenes were so realistic and brutally graphic. So much blood and carnage that truly disturbs the viewer. War is shown as what it is. Nasty!!!!!!!!! The acting was very good all around except from I think Matt Damon. But Tom Hanks never ceases to amaze me as he turns out one great performance. The film also stars Tom Sizemoore and Edward Burns as part of the rescue mission. Throughout the film there are many great cameos from actors like Paul Giamatti and even Ted Danson. Overall the acting was very good.The dialog was for the most part realistic but at some parts not as much. Captain Miller's character seemed to know to much about all the other operations that were happening in France. And some of the lines, although not many, were a little clich√©.I felt the film to be a little biased towards the Americans which I hate to see in movies. Spielberg seemed to convey the Germans as evil jerks. German soldiers were just like the American soldiers. There is a difference between the German Army and the Nazi SS. So I was ashamed to see the German soldiers representing evil. War should represent evil, not German soldiers. Both sides are committing unforgiving violence. Not just the Germans.Saving Privazte Ryan is a very good film. Everyone should at least experience it once, especially if you are a WW2 buff. Very educational! Not the best movie of all time but still very good.",8,4,7,23 September 2007
The Truman Show," A film that surprised me and became one of my favorites!!!
","The Truman Show stars Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, an accountant that lives in a small town called Seahaven. Truman thinks of himself as an ordinary guy. He is married, has a house, has a decent job, and has a decent life. Little does Truman know that he lives in a world created around him. Truman is the star of a TV show broadcasted around the world. His own life is on display for the world to see. In the film Truman becomes suspicious of the world around him. Events occur that baffle him. Truman knows something strange is going on but does not know what.Christoff, played by Ed Harris, is the creator of the show. As you watch the film you see that boundaries have been set for Truman. At a young age Truman was discouraged by everyone to not explore. Of course, being that it is a TV show everyone is an actor or actress, his mom and dad, his best friend, his wife, and everyone he sees on the streets everyday is a professional actor or actress. Truman's whole enviorment is fake and scripted except for himself. He doesn't even have a real father or mother. Truman was a test-tube baby. His life is controlled. Its almost like he has been enslaved. Truman's own enviorment is not even real. The entire town and area he lives in is inside a huge dome. The sun, moon, wind, rain, and clouds is all fake. Christoff plays God and controls Truman's life.Truman progresses through the film. He begins to notice that strange things are happening around him. Things he can't explain. He knows his wife does not love him and he notices that everything seems to be repeating itself like a routine. Everyday seems the same. Nothing changes. During the film Truman conquers his fears and breaks through barriers that he nor did Christoff think was possible.This was definitely Jim Carey's best performance of his career. He plays this serious role very well and at the same time adds a little zest to the character that no one else can do. Jim Carey is very good at showing emotions which was needed in this film.This film also tackled the possible future of entertainment. During the film there are random clips of people watching Truman on TV. People laugh and cry with Truman as they watch. But as a viewer of the film you want to curse at Christoff and all those people who watch the show because you feel sympathy for Truman. You as the viewer start to care about Truman. As you watch the film you want Truman to find out what has been going on.The film had great directing, great cinematography, great acting, and great music. Everything in this film flowed very well. The initial plot grabbed me and the great acting and writing sealed the deal. I would call this film a border-line masterpiece.If you are a fan of Jim Carey or if you want to see a great film, then look no further and watch The Truman Show.",10,0,1,15 August 2007
Casino," Great Movie!
","Casino is a film about the mob empire that secretly ran Las Vegas in the 1970's and early 80's. Casino follow's Sam 'Ace' Rothstein(Robert Deniro), a professional gambler who is given the task by the Mafia to run a casino in Las Vegas. His good old neighborhood friend, Nicky Santoro(Joe Pesci), is a wild, demonic gangster that is assigned to watch Ace's back. Ginger(Sharon Stone) is a hustler and ex-prostitute that Ace falls in love with. All three main characters have flaws. Some have minor flaws while others have major flaws. Each character's flaw leads them to their own demise. Casino is a film about money, power, and greed. This gripping tale show's how something good can go straight to hell.The characters are well developed. Ace is a cool character. He is a pretty smart guy and is a perfectionist. He is the best at what he does and he knows it. And what he does is illegal, but he does it in a clean way. But Nicky on the other hand is not a clean guy. His business is roughing people up and stealing. He is the muscle of the Mafia in Vegas and his job is to make sure know one messes with Ace and that know one messes up the money making scheme. Both Ace and Nicky are street guys who have been given the chance to do something big with their lives. When they each moved to Vegas they both had their own small goals and then one main goal that they both shared and that was making money for the Bosses back home. Then Ace meets Ginger. And everything gets turned upside down. Ginger is a hustler with a rough past, but Ace is drawn to her. Her beauty and style mesmerizes Ace. There is something about her that makes Ace go wild. Ace falls for Ginger and they get married. But even before they get married the viewer sees some instability in Ginger. And when she finally is married all of her instability is put on display. Half of her instability comes from her continued relationship with her ex-pimp, Lester Diamond(James Woods). Lester is a true sleezeball. Lester continually uses Ginger for money. His actions and even the way he dresses completely sells him as a sleezeball. These four great characters intertwine through the film creating great drama.Ace is the main protagonist. Ace has to push to get his gaming license in order to run his casino. Nicky creates a bad rap for Ace and the casino because of all his suspicions in crime. Nicky eventually ends up starting his own gang and begins robbing the locals of Las Vegas. Meanwhile Ace has a troubled marriage with Ginger. Ginger becomes more and more unstable. Ginger becomes an alcoholic and eventually a drug addict. She cheats on Ace with Lester and eventually with Nicky. Ace suspects that this is going. But he cannot stop loving Ginger. No matter how crazy she becomes he always gives in. Ace thought he could change Ginger by marrying her but all she wanted was his money. Ace himself becomes absorbed with the casino and his power. And Nicky is overwhelmed by greed. Nicky's goal is to take over the thrown in Vegas. In the end the Mob empire in Las Vegas collapses as do the lives of Ace, Ginger, and Nicky. There is one criticism I have on this film. I would like to comment on the narration. The film is filled with narration. The first narrator is Ace and the other is Nicky. The first hour of the film is like a documentary of Las Vegas in the 1970's. There are brief pauses with actual dialog but they are only brief. The narration continues through the movie but lessens in the second half. But never goes away I might add. The narration did do a good job of filling in the gaps. Sort of like Goodfellas. I liked Ace's narration but I felt annoyed by Nicky's. I didn't think it was needed. Deniro's voice is smooth while Pesci's voice is kinda annoying. But who am I to criticize Martin Scorsese. If he wants two narrators then he can get two narrators. ACTING4. Joe Pesci plays the usual wacko gangster like in Goodfellas and he has it mastered. I have never met Joe Pesci and I'm sure he doesn't act like Nicky but he is so believable that you start to wonder if he acts like that in real life.3. James Woods plays Lester so wonderfully. He is the definition for creepy and slimy. He does a great job of being a low-life looser.2. Sharon Stone is the only woman who could play Ginger. I know a lot of people hate Sharon Stone and find her annoying, but in Casino you are supposed to hate her. And she does a good job of being the person you hate.1. Robert Deniro was in my opinion the most impressive in the film. I think this is one of his best if not the best performance of his career. He plays Sam 'Ace' Rothstein so well. I cannot say that I like Ace but he's pretty cool. Deniro is so smooth. Even when he gets angry he is smooth. Deniro's performance was the best.OTHER ACTORS-- Don Rickels, Alan King, Kevin Pollack, and Frank Vincent also star in Casino and they do a great job with their more minor roles.WARNING!!!!! Casino is a very dark, brutal film. Full of very Strong, graphic, and brutal violence. There is also very strong language that is said through out the whole three hours of film. To finish I would like to say that Casino is a great film all around. With great acting, directing, and with a great story that is similar to a Shakespearean tragedy. Go watch it!!!",9,1,1,21 August 2007
Windtalkers," Worst war movie that I have seen yet!!!
","This was a terrible film all around. Just total garbage! I will begin by saying that the idea of making a film about the Navaho code talkers was a good idea, but the movie was just poorly made.The worst thing about this film was how unrealistic the war scenes were. Every time a grenade went off, you would see huge balls of fire. In fact this happened when anything exploded in the movie. Also the scenarios were just plain ridiculous. For instance, the scene where they are being shelled by their own artillery and they can't escape because of the Japanese. So what do they do. The rest of the company stays put while Nickolas Cage, the hero, and Adam Beach, the Navaho code talker, some how sneak around the enemies' front line and reach the enemy command post and kill the guards without no one else noticing. They then use the enemy radio at the command post to tell their artillery support that they are firing on the wrong people. They then direct the fire on the Japanese front-line, and haul ass to get out in time. Woo Hoo!!! Nickolas Cage saved the day. I don't think I have ever done something as ridiculous as that in a World War Two video game.And you are probably thinking, if the the battle scenes are over the top and unrealistic, then the acting must be too. If you are thinking that then you are right. Nickolas Cage? Christian Slater????? They do such a bad job of pretending to be a soldier that you wouldn't believe. Also the dialog is also very over the top and not delivered well by the actors.Poor directing, poor cinematography, poor special-effects, poor writing, and poor acting. Very unrealistic!!! Probably the worst war movie I have ever seen.",2,1,3,15 August 2007
