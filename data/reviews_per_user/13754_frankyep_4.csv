Kill Bill: Vol. 2," He delivers and he scores!
","In Kill Bill: Volume 1, we as an audience were thrilled to see the return of Quentin Tarantino and this magnificent artwork. Now as he continues with this Vol. 2, it seems that this one slightly outranks its predecessor. This film is absolutely brilliant for one reason because of the diolague. Because Tarantino tones down the excessive violence that was featured in Vol. 1, we can focus more on the characters and the powerful diolague from his magnificent screenplay. Also, though Uma Thurman is still dominate, the supporting characters are good as well. Such as Budd who almost plays a reformed sinner and Elle who is a sinister person and has the greatest scene in the entire movie, a showdown between her and the Bride in Budd's trailer. But one of the greatest characters is of course BILL. David Carradine is so brilliant in this role that the character seems to come alive. Through watching him, we have this feeling that even though he presents himself as a simple human being, through his actions we can see he is really a sick and sadistic person. My only complaint is that Michael Parks seems to try too hard to play a Mexican and get a thick Spanish accent than try to work on his lines. But still, this is an excellent film, a true delight and one that should surely not be missed. (***1/2)A-",10,1,3,3 October 2004
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Disappointing, Stupid & Terrible!!
","The cute kids of South Park finally come to the big screen in South Park:Bigger, Longer & Uncut from the clever creators of Trey Parker and Matt Stone. However, this is a disappointing attempt at the series' first film. In this tale, the kids sneak into an R-rated film starring their two favorite Canadian comedians and they soon discover much profane language is used. They start copying this language and soon the parents react. The moms form Mothers Against Canada(MAC)and prepare to lead an all-out war with the neighboring country. Meanwhile, down in Hell, Satan plans his to conquer the Earth along side his love partner Saddam Hussien. This is, unfortunately I have to say, is a terrible film. The musical numbers for one do not seem to add anything to the movie and just make it more non enjoyable. Secondly, because Parker and Stone now have the advantage of 'Uncut', they feel it needed to overload the film with profanity instead of concentrating on the jokes. It's almost as if the only joke it this film is simply having these third graders curse. Only two scenes in the entire movie gave interest to me: one(the only)humorous scene where a V-Chip that is inserted into Eric Cartman's head is tested for the first time and another where we are given the physical appearance of Kenny's face. But other than that, this film was one of the biggest disappointments I have ever seen. Thankfully, third time was the charm for Trey Parker and Matt Stone [first time: Basketball; second time: South Park movie; third time:Team America] (*)GRADE: D",1,5,32,26 October 2004
Alien," A group of travelers are menaced by an alien aboard their ship
","This is a fantastic film. In my opinion, it is the greatest science fiction horror film ever! It has a great mixture of cast members and portrays a great storyline that nobody has ever heard of before. Even in the previews they only showed short scenes of the film and there wasn't any scene with the ALIEN. It is terrific(and if you haven't seen the Director's Cut, it makes the film even better).",10,1,3,11 November 2003
War of the Worlds," Spielberg delivers again
","I have usually regarded 'master story-teller' Steven Spielberg as a man who was overrated. Every movie he made was just one everybody loved and he really didn't care that much about the movie at all. I believed him just to get a profit. However, Spielberg delivers us a powerful new film that strays away from his usual style.Like most that know the story of alien invasion, the plot of Martians coming to the planet Earth and beginning a quest to destroy all forms of Earthling life is a familiar story. But Spielberg gives us something more. Using film-making materials as his brush, he paints a well conceived, intense, vibrant, and at times frightening and disturbing portrait of alien hostile takeover. From the first moment with the Martian spaceships (called Tripods) arrive, we already know it won't be a fun ride. And as their laser beams blast to disintegrate people without will in a matter of seconds and tentacles that reach to grab already frighten humans, we the audience are at the edge of our seats. Bitting our nails as we feel that we are also running from these Tripods that let out a simple low horn-like sound that delivers a powerful effect of sending fear and chills in our body.Since Tom Cruise is starring in this picture, his character is like most of his in the past. The character has a large ego and a cocky presentation and throughout the course of the film he tries to amend his past ways to try and evolve into a better person. Even still, with Cruise's clich√©d character, he doesn't hurt the story that much and all actors put in a good effort to the intensity of the film. The only complaint is that Robbie, Crusie's son, is not a well acted character. His lines sometimes seen scripted and the actor tends to overact his character.This film is made even more terrifying and disturbing because we are now living in a post-9/11 world where we feel an emanate terror can strike us and we may feel powerless to stop it. This film has now changed my outlook on Spielberg's work. No longer do I see him as a conventional filmmaker who only delivers what studios want. He can make movies that stray away from light and happy situations and that lead to dark and disturbing road. Likewise with 'Schindler's List', I hope Spielberg continues to stray from his usual path of happiness because his best work comes from the truly dark films.",9,0,6,6 July 2005
