The Blair Witch Project," This movie was really...um...NOT scary at all...
","Well, I guess these people who thought this movie was frightening have never been camping.  I'll admit that I thought that parts of it were 'creepy,' maybe even 'chilling.'  But throughout most of the film I was dumbounded by the stupidity and thick-headedness of the characters, who throw themselves into a situation which they cannot handle.  None of the people I saw it with were frightened, though we were almost made ill by the violent, jerking motions of the hand-held cameras.  I think that _Blair Witch Project_ is interesting because of its nature as a documentary that isn't really a documentary, but, really, come on...I was never at any point in this movie frightened.",Null,2,4,5 July 1999
