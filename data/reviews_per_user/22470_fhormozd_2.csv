Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Extremely funny
","This movie was one of the funniest movies I have seen for a long time. Some parts of the movie was so funny that you would get scared from the way the person sitting near you is laughing. Although, the main characteristic of this movie is being hilarious, however, in my opinion the way that some stereotypes of US society was portrayed was amazing. In addition, showing how silly those people that group all the people in a minority in a same way are was brilliant.Also the comments made about women,which any person with right mind understands is just a joke, is trying to show how stupid those people who don't believe in gender equality look. I would like to add that the situation is not a total hypothetical one, as we know there does exists countries which women are treated as second citizens, and what better way to make fun of them than this. Although I don't think this movie is on the top 100 best movies, however, I believe it has made a great impact and we will see more movies coming out which are somehow inspired by Borat's movie. In nutshell it can be said if you enjoy comedies and don't get offend by jokes like the ones made in 'south park' for sure go watch this movie(or rent the DVD).I really was amazed with this movie and hope this good work continues.",10,1,12,4 January 2007
The Hills Have Eyes," Nerve Shattering, Disgusting
","I am some sort fan of horror movies, but this can not even be considered as a horror movie. It is waste of time, money and worst of all makes you fill sick in your stomach. IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING WATCHING THIS MOVIE CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED. If you have 2 hours time, I would suggest you to stare at an off TV, than watching this nerve shattering movie.If I want to describe it in a nutshell, I would say 'gross'. Don't watch it!!!!!! Don't Watch it!!!!! Don't Watch it!!!!! Don't Watch it!!!!! Don't Watch it!!!!",1,2,4,8 July 2006
