Hereditary," A well crafted horror movie
","Hereditary is not entirely original. It takes inspiration from a lot of horror classics. But that's exactly why it works. It doesn't break the usual stereotypes of the genre, but gives them a new touch with a bit of originality and cleverness. With the visually stunning lightning the movie successfully presents its inner tone and with the cliches of the genre it keeps the form that so many viewers are seeking and enjoying. The performances are good and with the help of clever editing tricks the film becomes incredibly atmospheric. If you expect an entirely new set of plot elements that you've never seen before don't watch it. But if you like craftsmanship in the horror genre and enjoy rearangments that manage to hit home then go straight ahead and see it.",7,0,1,21 March 2020
1917," A masterpiece
","1917 is a perfect film. It's not only captivating, moving and thrilling but it's also one of the best crafted movies ever made. My favorite things about it is how easy it is to remember all of its scenes in a chronological order. Every single scene is an element and a tool for the progression of the story. It doesn't matter if it's a crossing of a battlefield, pushing a cart or having a one on one shootouts with the enemy, it's all beautifully done and an example of how continuity should be executed. My favorite scene is the one in which we see the soldiers sitting in a big circle and listening to the Wayfarig Stranger. In this scene, one of the most touching I've ever seen our hero finally reaches the soldiers he's trying to find, but he finds that out only after the end of the song, because it's so electric that nobody really notices his presence there. The death of one of the main characters also serves as an example of a wonderfully crafted picture, because it's as sudden and realistic as none of us expect to see. Another interesting feature is the pain that the characters go through. Its constantly present on screen with characters putting their bleeding hands in a rotting corpse, being blown up, shot, beaten and chocked to death. One of my favorite things about the film is the fact that it never addresses the physical pain and the injuries that William Schofield constantly sustains. Every once in a while he sits down for a moment, touches the back of his head, which is bleeding of course and at the next moment he is back on the road. The fantastic Oscar worthy cinematography, direction and effects add the finishng touches to this timeless masterpiece.",10,2,2,23 March 2020
The King," Fun historical fiction
","The King is inspired by historical events and the works of Shakespeare. A lot of people say that its historically inaccurate and it misrepresents many historical facts.The thing that struck me while i was watching it was how quickly this movie rushes through the different stages of its story. This is a bit of a double edged sword, because it gives the movie a good tempo, but at the same time i felt like there is so much happening in such a little period of time. I think that it couldve made a great tv show if the writers wanted to really develop their plot and characters.Personal relationships play a great role in this movie and we are exposed to many acts of bravery, leadership and betrayal. We see the virtue of friendship and duty. There is a lot of cruelty as well.I didnt have any issues with the inspiration of the film and its choice to pick random events and to give them a spin fitting its trajectory. I really liked Pattinson in the role of the french prince and his accent didnt bother me at all. What i disliked though is how pathetic and unimportant the actual french king was. For a character of such importance, i think his presence felt incredibly marginal.The movie emphasizes a lot on how brave and honorable young Henry is and how he is ready to sacrifice himself in order to safe his men. Yet at the end we see that being young means being naive most of the time. Henry is questioning his decisions and is struggling to find meaning behind them.Its a great story of how growing up with more responsibilities than you can take can lead to unwise, spontaneous decisions. We find a lot of Shakespearean traits to the people surrounding the young king as they play their own personal games and pursue their own individual goals.The sets are great and the productions is wonderful. For the relatively small budget of $23 million the movies looks really convincing and the choreography of the battles is awesome. Im not sure if it was because of the budget or the length, but many important ceremonies and meetings were shortened and felt a bit rushed.Overall a great medieval tale of kings and battles, but if youre looking for historical accuracy its probably not for you.",7,1,1,27 May 2020
The Nice Guys," Wonderful start
","The first 40 minutes of the film are amazing. The tempo and the beat of the story feel very natural and all of its elements seem to be mixing well together. The story itself is an interesting spin on the classical detective movies of the 70s. My main issue is that like many other films, this one also becomes overwhelmed with its great premise and isn't really sure what to do. Maybe the most staggering case of a great first half and below mediocre second one that I've seen. The wrap up is laughable and doesn't live up to the great start. Crowe and Gosling are great. Matt Bomer is a gross miscast. The movie is competently shot and well directed, but as I already said it seems like it was only a good idea for a story and when it was time to expand on it everything fell apart. Ultimately tolerable movie and if youre not too picky and only looking to be entertained I think youre going to enjoy it.",7,1,2,22 April 2020
