E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," scarred for life
","The first thing you need to know is that my impression of this film is forever colored by my first exposure to it.  When ET was released, I was 4 years old.  It is the first movie I can remember seeing in the theater, and it scarred me for life.  Really, this is a widespread phenomenon.  If you were not born between the years 1977 and 1980, you may not understand what I'm talking about, but I'm telling you it's true.  Ask anyone in that age bracket--if they saw ET in the theater, I guarantee they had the same experience.Imagine yourself as a four-year-old, in a dark room, filled with people you don't know, watching the story of ET.  You are a bit apprehensive about this strange-looking creature, but as Henry Thomas and Drew Barrymore grow to love him, so do you.  You want one of your own...he's like a pet or maybe a stuffed animal come to life.  What fun!  Until, that is, the horrible people in the white jumpsuits take over the movie.   All of a sudden, all these grown-ups are out to get ET.  The screen is taken over by mean-looking people and, even worse, all those scary tubes and quarantine equipment.  At this point, you--the four-year-old--are terrified.  You don't understand why all those mean people want to hurt ET.  Your parents take you out of the theater, into the shock of daylight, and more than likely vow not to take you to a movie for a long, long time.Now, I can understand that ET is a highly regarded film, and I can appreciate why many people love it.  But I defy you to find someone born in 1977-1980 who loves it.  We were all scarred for life.",4,9,18,30 May 2001
Moulin Rouge!," flawed, yet remarkable
","This movie, like its show-within-a-show, is spectacular in the original sense of the word.  It is a visual spectacle unlike anything else in recent memory.  Baz Luhrman is to be commended for pushing the boundaries of mainstream American film.  Regardless of any other qualities, this accomplishment alone makes this movie a must-see for film buffs.Luhrman is a risk-taking filmmaker if there ever was one, and as such he is bound to make a few mistakes.  The movie drags at the end, unable to keep up the fast-cut, MTV-style frantic pace of the first two-thirds.  McGregor's character, while inherently likeable, is perhaps not such a great writer, as his narration grows increasingly cliched and saccharine.  Nevertheless, McGregor and Kidman have created characters that the audience cares about and will root for, and so it is not difficult to stick with the film through its flaws.The use of popular songs, often in unexpected ways, is arresting and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny.  This humor is a strength of the movie, as this film would have fallen flat on its face had it taken itself too seriously.  The music is done very well with sharp choreography and surprisingly good--even excellent--vocals.  In particular, the 'Roxanne' sequence is magnificently performed and edited.While there are moments in which 'Moulin Rouge' flounders, it more than makes up for it in its visual allure and boundary-pushing style.",8,0,1,3 June 2001
