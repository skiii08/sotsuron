Marie Antoinette," That was a bad idea to go to that movie.
","I'm sorry people, not a very good movie. I just about walked out of the movie theater because I was just not interested in it. Most of it was her walking around, buying things, petting goats and crying. I don't understand how people liked it. The storyline was not interesting at all. The only reason I am giving it a 2 is because the first fifteen minutes or so was funny, I liked the music that they used ( if they used classical music or something like that I WOULD have walked out), and there was o.k acting from Kate. Nothing all that great though. I really can't see why some people really liked it. It's got to be one of the worst movies I have seen this year.",2,2,4,8 November 2006
The Prestige," An excellent movie
","The Prestige was a wonderful movie. It had great actors, a great storyline (though sometimes kinda confusing), and was a great thriller. Although I knew the actors playing the characters, I was so into the movie I did not see Hugh Jackman or Christian Bale. I just saw their characters, and that means that they did a good job. I was always hooked on the storyline and was never bored throughout the whole story. I just wanted to see what would happen to the characters. My only problem was that it was kinda confusing. The good guy was the bad guy and vice versa, and the whole concept of cloning was tough to understand, but they ended it very well and in a way that I understood the whole thing. That whole day all I was thinking about was that movie.",9,1,1,8 November 2006
The Shining," Great horror film, maybe the best.
","I thought that The Shining was a great horror film. It was probably the best horror film I had ever seen. It had really good casting for starters. Jack Nicholson was great in this movie (he's just naturally crazy, his wife's face is just creepy, perfect for a horror film, and that boy was pretty freaky too. The movie also had some really freaky music that kept the mood. If your going to make any movie based on a Stephen King book, its going to be pretty freaky. If anyone who is reading this has not seen the movie yet, I think you should read the book first. The book was better than the movie, but the movie still kicked.",9,0,0,8 November 2006
The Matrix," A very good action film
","I have the DVD and I watch this movie all the time. I must have seen it about a million times. The action in this movie is just so awesome! I love all of the fight sequences. My only problem with it is the fact that it gets very cheesy, and when there is no action, there is just boring dialog. The dialog just sets up for the story, but they could have made it a little bit more interesting. The story line is also very well written. It's one of those movies that makes you think, and the fact that we ARE in a Matrix kinda creeps you out. No outstanding acting. I put it on my movie list just for the action in it. One of the top five action movies of all time.",8,1,2,10 November 2006
