Blade Runner 2049," Trouble staying awake
","Went to see a movie with my GF, we ended up watching Blade Runner... what a mistake.. The movie is really really slow and i usually like the slower movies but this was just over the top slow. The visuals on the other hand really nice. Also i really liked the acting! I saw my GF watching on the clock every 15 minutes and i almost fell asleep 3 times waking up to gunshots. Was hoping it would be more then this but unfortunately it is not. When the movie ended i heard more people that had trouble keeping awake.",3,12,24,20 October 2017
