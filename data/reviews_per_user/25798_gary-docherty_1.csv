First Man," Spaced out
","Everyone knows Neil Armstrong was the first man on the moon, but hardly anyone knows the story of what it took to get him there.
This film was a great chance to tell that story, but honestly I struggled to watch it to the end.
It's dull. There was no depth to the characters, there was no real exploration of the achievements made by the people behind the space programme.
The relationship between Neil and his wife felt like it was only there to give a personal side to the story.
All the potential was there but it just didn't come together to make for an interesting or even watchable film.",4,2,4,12 January 2019
