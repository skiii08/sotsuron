The Blair Witch Project," The World's Biggest Con-Trick
","I watched 'The Blair Witch Project' in a crowded cinema. At the end of the movie the audience sat for a moment in stunned silence not because they were scared to move but simply in the sudden realization that they had been victims of a massive marketing con-trick. In years to come people will remember how they were taken in by all the hype while the reviewers who hailed the movie as 'genuinely frightening and disturbing' will hang their heads in shameful embarrassment at the memory of how they were so easily duped. OK so the movie was 'original' but even an 'original' horror film should make you jump or at least leave you feeling uneasy. Does anyone really care what happens to these obnoxious, foul-mouthed young people. I was hoping the girl who led the expedition would be bumped off as quickly as possible, so that my ears could be spared her ranting. And are we seriously expected to believe that she would just carry on filming despite being scared to death and in a state of complete panic? The makers of this movie must be laughing all the way to the bank. If ever there was a case of 'The Emperor's New Clothes', this was it!!",1,2,4,8 December 1999
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Ignore the cynics
","Forget all those people who tell you it's not as good as the book. So what? This is a film after all. It is a sheer joy to watch, made entirely on location in Cephallonia, gorgeous photography but with dark, disturbing moments as well. The only problem I have is with the obvious miscasting of Nicolas Cage as captain Corelli. Apart from that the film was a very pleasant surprise.",9,1,3,15 May 2001
The Impossible," A Curate's Egg of a movie
","The actual tsunami is well done; this and the scenes immediately after are gruelling and hard to watch - lots of blood and pain, near-drowning etc. Then the movie settles down into an old-fashioned 'search for lost family members' type of pic with all the sentimental manipulation that involves. Much of the film leaves a poor impression - it replaces the actual Spanish family with a classic middle-class English whose members display all the mannerisms and behaviour you would expect right down to the heroic eldest son who saves his mother etc (Admittedly a fine performance from young Tom Holland). The film is blatantly manipulative, the music swells in all the expected places and so it's hard to feel genuinely moved by the family's plight. Just as irritating is the fact that much of the filming is by hand-held camera and after half-an-hour or so I began to feel distinctly queasy. I really do wish directors would put out of their heads the notion that realism can only be depicted by use of the hand-held camera.",6,0,4,19 January 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Tedious,Tiresome....and far too long
","I can't understand why so many people are raving about this film. To me it was just one long yawn. It conformed to a current style of film-making which sadly involves substituting boring stunts and ho-hum special effects (all of which have been seen countless times before)instead of a decent storyline and real atmosphere. This sort of treatment was fine during the 1980's when Indiana Jones and the like seemed fresh and fun but surely young cinemagoers are entitled to something more intelligent in 2003 - such as a plot that makes sense, straight acting and some semblance of historical accuracy. And another thing.. where on earth did Johnny Depp get that accent from? He sounded and looked like an inebriated Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones!",2,8,18,13 August 2003
Alexander," Braveheart Goes East
","Most people who go to see 'Alexander' are doing so to see if it is really as bad as all the critics have made out. Well- it isn't quite as bad. Certainly the cast all overact and the script is poor but 'Alexander is basically just an old-fashioned sword-and-sandals epic and these have always been standard elements in this type of film. Colin Farrell does his best but is seriously miscast in the role of the eponymous hero. The entire Macedonian army speak with some variation of an Irish or Scottish accent (although why this should be any more unacceptable than them all speaking with American accents, I'm not really sure). Despite the thousands of miles travelled over many years, you never really get the feeling of space and time that Alexander's journey should convey. The film feels quite studio-bound in the main and it is left to computer graphics and the obligatory thunderous Vangelis soundtrack to create the illusion of a vast audio-visual experience. However we should be grateful at least that Oliver Stone has made a genuine attempt to tell a real story based on actual events from Ancient History.Although the ending is a long time coming, I actually found it quite moving",5,1,2,10 January 2005
Hot Fuzz," You've been had..
","Am I the only person who has seen this film and found it hugely over-rated? The overall impression I had was of a film that is not nearly as amusing nor as slick as it thinks it is. The makers have created a very smug movie that positively challenges its audience not to go along for the ride and get taken in by the sharp editing which makes you think you are seeing and hearing more than you actually do. In fact the special effects are just about passable, the shoot 'em up near the end tedious and the soundtrack nothing more than the usual crash - bang excesses that every 'action' movie has to have nowadays. Clearly appealing purely to the juvenile market, 'Hot Fuzz' is also some 30 minutes too long. What a bore.",3,6,20,20 March 2007
The Others," Classy ghost story in the best tradition...
","Set in Jersey at the end of World war 2 and filmed in Spain, The Others is a good old-fashioned ghost story with all the classic ingredients - tinkling pianos in deserted rooms, doors that slam themselves shut, strange whisperings and sinister servants. The film is lifted onto another level, largely due to a superb performance by Nicole Kidman, ably supported by an excellent cast.Like 'The Sixth Sense', the film is deliberately slow, ponderous and very atmospheric with finely judged 'scary' moments. The twist at the end is totally unforseen and very effective, though as with the Sixth sense, it doesnt really stand up to close scrutiny. A very welcome change from the tedium of latex-filled monsters, gore and computer generated fx.",9,0,0,13 November 2001
Troy," Old-fashioned sword and sandals epic..
","Troy could've been so much better. I can forgive the hammy acting and the cod-Shakesperean dialogue (it's what you expect) but does every epic movie have to feature the same pseudo-Celtic music wailing on the soundtrack - I wasn't expecting to hear bouzoukis playing but a bit more imagination is needed - like silence now and again! And why not end the movie with a voice-over telling us what happened AFTER Troy fell, to put the story in  its historical context. This was another wasted opportunity. As for the wooden horse - it's hard to believe the Trojans would have wanted it inside their city. Just think if they had taken Paris' advice and burned it on the spot that would've made the Greeks look mighty foolish!",5,1,4,7 June 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," A real clunker but...
","This movie gets zero for acting, dialogue and plot and is unintentionally hilarious for the most part. I suspect it was made deliberately tongue-in-cheek by Roland Emmerich (Americans all fleeing to Mexico for refuge after agreeing to cancel their national debt is a masterstroke). I loved the bit where Dennis Quaid said 'Get your snow=shoes on, we are walking from here' - and they did, even in those conditions! The tidal-wave hitting Manhattan and the big freeze up scenes were admittedly quite spectacular but other fx were nothing special. However i forgive the movie all its faults and absurdities since it shows civilisation beginning and ending with the written word. Any movie that spends most of its time in the New York Public Library deserves to be commended - at least it's heart is in the right place.",3,0,1,29 May 2004
The Bourne Ultimatum," Great action movie but be warned....
","Some of the stunts are sensational and the movie never lets up from the moment it starts. However after about half-an-hour the restive hand-held camera-work and rapid fire editing become very wearing and you just long for a long lingering shot and some peace and quiet. Relentless hand-held camera filming just makes you feel nauseous after a while and adds nothing to the movie.The plot is really quite old-hat, somewhat reminiscent of many older movies with the so-called government good guys up to no good. Despite this, Bourne 3 is a cracking film with never a dull moment. The soundtrack is really good; Matt Damon is excellent as usual and Julia Stiles is gorgeous.",8,19,37,18 August 2007
The Village," Waiting for the twist will keep you awake....
","OK so it's not as dreadful as 'Blair Witch Project', a film that 'The Village' vaguely resembles, but it certainly does not stand up to any sort of close scrutiny. For the sake of the plot only the blind girl can leave the village since she would be unable to 'see' the truth on the outside but for heavens sake she actually runs through the wood and has no difficulty scaling a 10 foot wall never mind gauge exactly the moment she will be attacked so she can take evasive action:sorry but this was just too corny for words. Nice atmosphere, moody music but the actors speak their stilted dialogue ('This is the shed that must not be used....The coat that is made of the colour that is safe etc etc..) so earnestly as if they actually believed the rubbish they were saying. The whole thing is so po-faced you just feel like bursting out laughing to lighten up the proceedings. Better than 'Signs' but not as good as 'Unbreakable' and nowhere near the quality of 'Sixth Sense'.",6,0,0,29 August 2004
The Pianist," Outstanding
","Exceptionally well made with a wonderful, under-stated central performance, the film is let down only by one scene near the end in which survivors of the concentration camp are seen haranguing captured German soldiers. The portrayal of starving, emaciated human beings is always a problem and this film is no exception - everyone looks just too well fed. The fact that a stodgy, tasteless musical like 'Chicago' won the Oscar for Best film over 'The Pianist' is beyond comprehension.",8,0,3,6 April 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Great to look at but.....
","Although undeniably brilliant to look at, the second part of the LOTR trilogy is (like the first) really just a lot of people with silly names acting out a very confusing storyline in places with equally daft names. Such a pity that all that time and effort (and money) wasnt invested in recreating a genuine historical event surrounding one of the great conflicts of the past. It is a wonder some of the actors were able to keep their faces straight while speaking some of the cod-Shakesperean dialogue. A lot of people rate LOTR as the best book ever written in the English (!) language and some already rate the film(s) just as highly - they need to get out more into the real world. Having said that, I enjoyed the film immensely and never dozed off once.",6,0,0,5 January 2003
The Mummy Returns," Distinctly sub-Indiana Jones
","Even for a childrens movie, 'The Mummy returns' leaves a lot to be desired. Takes away the doctored soundtrack, the endless musical crescendos and the now all too familiar digital fx and what have you got? A hollow movie devoid of any real storyline with some of the worst acting I have seen in years - hardly surprising given the leaden script. The movie fails abysmally (as did the first one) because it can't decide whether to play it entirely for fun or go for genuine shocks. The film picks up a bit towards the end with the appearance of the Army of the Undead and I quite liked the Scorpion king. Despite the endless noise I slept through much of it.",4,0,0,20 May 2001
Inception," Impressive in some ways but.....
","..hugely overrated, underneath all the fx, cgi, noise and hand-held camera and despite the convoluted storyline, the film is nothing more than standard Hollywood fare. The troubled hero with a past history of marital problems (yawn)...you just know for certain as soon as you see his two kids that the ending will see him reunited with them..no surprises there then. Far too long and absurdly pretentious at times, I burst out laughing at one point when someone said 'Just a minute, whose subconscious are we trying to enter now'. Give me a break (and a story that has a narrative I can follow). Trying to convey the world of dreams in movies is always destined to fail. Dreams are highly personal experiences. Ever tried telling someone what you were dreaming about only to think 'Well it's very hard to explain'? Exactly - dreams don't follow any sort of cohesive narrative rather they are a series of apparently unconnected images and scenarios that appear to make no sense whatsoever.",5,3,7,30 July 2010
Signs," What a turkey!
","Watching this movie in expectation but with growing alarm, it was hard to believe it was made by the same director of 'The Sixth Sense'. What on earth was he thinking of? In 'Signs' we have every modern film cliche thrown in - the asthmatic child, the dysfunctional family, the husband tortured by his wife's death in a car accident on which he keeps having flashbacks.The sci-fi element was just ridiculous and laughable. Are we to believe aliens had the technology to travel millions of light years to Earth but yet couldn't get past a pantry door? The final scenes were so stupid (and yet so predictable) I almost gasped in disbelief. I rate this the most disappointing movie since 'Blair Witch' conned everyone a few years back.",2,6,11,19 September 2002
Identity," A rainy night in Nevada...
","Well acted, fast paced and avoiding most of the usual cliches, 'Identity' is an above-average horror film. Good to see Ray Liotta and John Cusack together but with such a good cast, the film would have been much better if played as a straight thriller. As it is, you just know there is going to be a twist in the story and probably a 'surprise' ending (both right). The explanation for the murders is barely credible and basically makes a nonsense of the whole film.But still a good effort.",7,0,0,18 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Thank God it's over!
","Like the others in the trilogy, ROTK may be awesome to look at but what on earth is the point of the whole thing? A lot of people with silly names speaking cod-Shakesperean dialogue fighting battles in equally silly-named places - the final part is more like an episode of Stars Wars than anything else. And they all take it so seriously!! What a shame that so much time, effort and cost could not have gone into producing something of genuine artistic merit and substance.",2,2,7,3 January 2004
Gangs of New York," Dodgy accents...dodgy acting.
","The performance of Daniel Day-Lewis stands out from what is a seriously flawed movie. Leonardo DiCaprio is seriously miscast,the story is hardly inspiring and the film suffers from problems with continuity. All of the cast look far too well fed and healthy to be the poorest of the poor - and did they really live in subterranean dwellings that look like caves? Scorsese is a great director but his preoccupation with the low life seems morally repugnant here. Historical accuracy goes out the window as the gang members are portrayed in a semi-heroic light. The love interest grafted on in the shape of Cameron Diaz is pathetic. A lot of praise has been heaped on the film's attention to period detail and there are indeed some interesting observations - I particularly liked the 'Allsorts' barrel in the bar wherein all the slops are thrown to provide a cheap drink. However it was impossible to avoid the impression that you were simply watching a crowd of  extras parading around a large film set in period costume. Every scene was laid on with a trowel.",5,21,29,19 January 2003
