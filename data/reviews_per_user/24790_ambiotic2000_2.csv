The Ring," knockoff i think not...
","I'm Fairly disgusted by the rampant comparisons to david lynch twin peaks or blair witch.... First off before u go callin this movie a knockoff of cult classics , you must first come to understand , THIS IS A CULT CLASSIC. 'Ringu' was one if not the most crafty movie in its genre. Not for its camera work ( tho im a big fan of the over use of the color grey in this movie ) but for its script, both original and spooky in our tv generation the boogieman if u will for the x geners (and about as far off as u can imagine from twin peaks where if you had actualy saw the show or have ever seen any other david lynch movie uses his script to let out angers he has deep down inside him, thus making a tale about a videotape that has a curse from a witch i hardly see relating to bob and the gang from twin peaks .. good try thoo.) If anything this is a knockoff of another genre classic 'VideoDrome' by david chronenberg. In Ring you are taken on the ride from the first frame and you dont feel safe untill you hear everyone let out the big sigh when the credits role. It is a mistake to compare ring to the other crafty thriller 'signs' . 'Signs' was a reawakening of the use of imagination which we lack so much in movies theese days with the over use of special effects. Ring follows in this pattern , but not in the fashion where u realy dont get a good look at the shadow till the end, in ring you have a tape the same everytime u watch it, and thats the point. Ring is an old fashioned movie where u have the same situation thru the whole movie but the more information you get the more creepy it gets. Rebirth to the cool crafty horror movies of old??? I think not, but at least whe have mnight to hold us over. Now if you wana see more than just a movie to zone out to for 2 hours... punch drunk love is for you .. how can he use his camera like that!?!",Null,0,0,18 October 2002
Signs," Amazing , Smart , Complex , and a style that will take years to beat
","Signs is one of thoose movies that draws you in from the start and never lets go .. In theese days of pointless movies that give the audience no credit for understanding 'Signs' comes out and smacks the industry in the face.. Its nice to see a big budget movie come out with such style and craft... If your looking to see a scary movie with lots of guts and no brains then Signs is not your movie .. If your looking for terror that you create that you dictate this is your movie.Its Almost as if M. Night was a student of Hitchcock, From the Intro to the music everything is almost cut and dry Hitchcock(including his role in every movie). He crafts a very tight Charecter Study, yes its not a movie about aliens to most of your suprize. This movie is more about Faith ... Trust.. and well Signs.
********Spoilers***********************Some of the things i picked up in the movie where M's smart craft of having such a strong plot wrapped in a simple premis. Its easy to make alien movies but to have a movie about a mans faith which this movie is about is so amazing. I love the every little deatail from J. Phoenix charecter smashing the lightbulb to actauly never seen any danger to the end.. Also if you notice closely throughout the movie when he shows the water he lots of times pans to the cross.. I'm pretty sure that it was holy water but i could be wrong .. Also eluding the 3 middle east states where god was belived to be from .. or at least jesus.. could possibly the water they used be holy because where it was from??? also the ending is killer gota love the irony...**********Talking back to thoose who didnt like it********* For all of thoose i have seeen whining about how it was boring and slow and dull.. I am not sure what movie you were watching cause i dont remember one untense moment the whole flick.. Go see Halloween if u want guts .. maybe the simple plot that you were all looking for is more sutiable .. and please dont compare Six Sense to this completly diffrent movie diffrent style and diffrent mood all together.. To have a whole movie inside of a home and have about 5 charecters that mean anything is beyond me.. this is a true work of art and hopefully (lets pray ) of more good things to come from the other wise dull mainstream that has become of motion pictures.. with exception of a handfull this was the first widely hyped non indie movie ive seen in a long time where i had no negitive outlooks on itI give signs 10/10 thoo i still think one hour photo is gona be the movie of the summer",10,0,1,3 August 2002
