The Benchwarmers," A decently funny movie
","After hearing mixed comments about this movie i decided to check it out for myself. Entering the theater I set my expectations low, and I left the theater satisfied. The plot is rather clichÃ© and run-of-the-mill, the laughs are rather low-brow, and there's an abundant amount of potty humor but there is clearly a target audience for that and it succeeds in reaching its demographic. The acting is pretty solid through out the movie. David Spade is especially funny in this movie portraying a sarcastic, insecure little geek. The main star Rob Schneider delivers a kind of boring yet solid performance, but its nothing he hasn't done before. I am disappointed most by the acting of John Hedder. I liked him in Napolean Dynamite, but now he's becoming a one trick pony and his performance in this is poor and makes the character more annoying than anything. All of the supporting cast adds to the mix, especially John Lovitz. The story is simple, some geeks wanting revenge so they form a group of nerds to play a sport ad get recognition. Its complete with predictable plot twists. Importantly, the movie is filled with some big laughs. A lot of it is consistent snickers, some flat jokes, but there are some big laughs. So in conclusion I say grab some friends and go give this movie a shot if your in the target audience like me, but if your not I suggest stay away.Score:6.5/10",10,1,3,26 April 2006
