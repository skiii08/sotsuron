Spartacus," praise
","The darkest historical epic. No dancing girls, no chariot races, filmed in sombre browns and reds.  Nominally directed by Kubrick but Douglas, as a very 'hands on' producer was responsable for the operatic sweep of the film. I was astonished when revisiting the film in 1991 at the cinema at the bravery of the project-to have the hero cry several times, once even out of self pity and with a heart rending ending! The film has depth and weight, the characters are well drawn. The performances are almost flawless, Douglas managing as actor to create tension in each scene-Olivier, not withstanding his eyerolling mannerisms is perfectly cast. The minor parts are richly drawn-gravel voiced Charles McGraw, Herbert Lom and Woody Strode. The cinematography and music are flawless. Only John Dall as a very modern Glaberus and John Ireland as Crixus seem out of place.  Ironically, despite the downbeat tone of the film it is impossible to watch it without being uplifted through your tears of compassion. Unofficialy remade as Braveheart...watch one after the other and you'll see the similarities in mood, theme and even the battle choreography. Spartacus would be my 'desert island' movie.",10,91,127,25 June 2001
The Alamo," All on the weight of one man's shoulders.
","This is a flat, confusing mess. Dennis Quaid has a large cameo, Jason Patrick is asleep or seems to be most of the time and the itself film dozes off when Billy Bob Thornton is off-screen. It never really stirs the blood, the battle scenes are tame and flat.It's like an edited down TV miniseries. But when Thornton is on screen the film takes off. It is a rare example of a good actor carrying a movie.The John Wayne version was very long but Wayne and co. bailed it out with charisma and it was the 'Epic' that the subject deserved.This version is astonishingly flat considering the commitment expressed by everyone in the DVD featurettes.",6,1,2,29 September 2004
Dunkirk," Oh dear...Rather disappointed.. it's a bit of a mess.
","This could have been a Disney live action film of the 60's it's that inoffensive. No blood or maiming, no cigarettes and no moustaches!! Narrative and editing a right old mess and to be quite honest I didn't give a damn about any of the characters really. Even the much touted air combat sequences are not too gripping. Deflection shooting is skated over to avoid silly us getting confused. Elgar's Nimrod is slower than Bernsteins version...so slow that is simply turgid and almost unrecognisable. 5/10",5,2,2,8 December 2017
Quantum of Solace," Bourne 4
","On arrival at my local multiplex I asked for 2 tickets for 'Bourne 4' and and the ticket seller knew exactly what I wanted - he didn't bat an eye! It's not a Bond film, it's a bland B movie with expensive action sequences that are neither exciting or fresh and the editing is of the 'Let's agitate the viewer's eye and they'll think that they are excited rather that simply irritated' - the editing is so frenetic that you I really found myself drifting off - at one point I went 'Oh Bond is hanging upside down - how did that happen?' Henchmen who couldn't hit a barn door and a lead villain who is bland. But then so is Bond/Bourne played by a tired looking, short, fair haired, middle-aged character actor with narrow shoulders. On radio Mr Craig would be a perfect Bond but visually it should be James Purefoy, Gerard Butler etc; Nice theme tune though and soundtrack music.",4,4,6,3 December 2008
