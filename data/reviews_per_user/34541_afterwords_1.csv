Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Hate Sacha. What a creep.
","I was looking forward to this movie. I had high expectations because of positive reviews. I didn't realize how foul, vile, ugly and cruel, it was going to be (not all, but far too much of it). Look, I love the Daily Show. I think Stephen Colbert, Rob Corddry and John Stewart, Samantha Bee et al are awesome. But those characters poke as much fun at themselves as they do to their reporting subjects. I simply can't picture any of them violating someone's trust the way Sacha did when he was at the etiquette dinner. It's one thing to pretend to be a doofus, it's another to carry a bag of Sacha, I mean, poop, into a dinner. I mean, it's not cool. Then the prostitute shows up and he gets nasty with the hosts. What a horrible thing to do: shame on anybody who thinks they 'deserved' it. Also, his depiction of Kazaks as virulently anti-semitic... a joke to Americans (why?)-- not to them. No, Borat is a testament to one's man self-righteousness, smug, smirking sense of superiority, an overrated creep with a vicious, callous, antisocial soul.",1,3,6,21 June 2008
