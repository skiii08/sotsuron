Blade Runner 2049," I fell sleep rather than watching a ' runner'!
","The movie could be done within 15 minutes, not 2:40 hours.Still waiting for the story.",1,7,13,23 October 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Is there any way I can give more than 10 starts for this movie ?
","I can't describe the amount of adrenaline and tension this movie brought to me. All I can say is that this is the most brilliant movie that could combine all those stars together, putting every one of them at the super role ; excellent dialogues, funny among the serious and tensioned scenes, each role at this movie cannot be taken by another actor.
Congratulations, you deserve to get all the credits in the world",10,1,5,18 October 2018
