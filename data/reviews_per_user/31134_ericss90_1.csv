","This is certainly one of the bestcomedies I have seen. Adam makes me laugh in every movie he makes,that's great. He should be proud of himself. I find it annoying that I have to add 10 lines to leave a comment. Come on guys. give me a break. am I fine now? not yet! gosh, and what about now? hey perhaps this will make someone laugh too. well, what can I say, I am a potential star.... just kidding. Guys, you won't believe, I haven't reached yet the 10 lines at this point. I really don't know what else to write. Adam you are great! Hey, I really mean it, man!I think I am almost there.... let's see now....",10,0,0,4 October 2006
