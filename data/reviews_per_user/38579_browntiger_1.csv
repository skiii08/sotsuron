Blade Runner 2049," Let down
","This is nearly 3 full hours movie with 10 minute plot that has no end. I like the CGIs, however most of them where not original and never needed. It felt more like director spent so much money on CGIs so he was milking it for every second. If a character climbed the stairs they had to show him stepping on every single stair. The movie dragged on and on.The movie presented viewer with 3 hours of boring dialogue, hollow characters and an embarrassingly weak story, and not one memorable line. I felt like actors intentionally spoke very slow because they were paid by the minute. Gosling was good, but Harrison Ford was there for a paycheck. I doubt he put any effort. Do not know much about a soundtrack, other than it was booming in my head for another three hours ... i just wished to god ... please make it stop. This movie made the 'Suicide Squad' look like a masterpiece. In my opinion they were just trying to ensure there is a material for the sequel/franchise, rather than telling the story. I am still shocked that they spent 183 million on that? Some described this movie as thought provoking - go watching it on the big screen for 3 hours, I am just curious what though did it provoke?",4,2,4,6 January 2018
