Walk the Line," Excellent Movie - Highly Recommended
","I am a great lover of country music & of Johnny Cash's in particular, so when this movie became available on DVD, made a beeline for the video shop & hired it. To say that I was not disappointed by the movie would be an understatement. Joaquin Phoenix & Reese Witherspoon are totally convincing in their acting & without a doubt were the perfect choices for the roles of Cash & Carter. The fact that they spent six months for singing lessons & instrument playing, plus the fact that they were personally selected by Johnny & June to portray them in the movie speaks for itself. Even if you are not a fan of country music, after watching this movie, I am sure you will become one.",10,1,2,1 August 2006
Django Unchained," Blood,Guts & Glory - Just The Way Tarantino Does It
","Ostensibly a tribute to spaghetti Western genre of films, DU delivers the goods as far as gunplay and bloodbaths go - in the first ten minutes a man and a horse get their heads blown off. Then the body count gradually increases every 20 minutes till this almost 3 hour serious version of Blazing Saddles comes to an end. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy watching it - viewed it a second time as a matter of fact - but felt that Tarantino could have done better with a more viable screenplay and organised direction. There seems to be a lot of disjointed moments that need further elucidation - more than coincidental that the very first plantation visited happened to harbour the fugitives from justice that the main characters were seeking for. Christoph Waltz turns in a memorable performance as Dr King Schultz, German expatriate ex-dentist who speaks impeccable Oxford Dictionary style English, who has turned to bounty hunting as a calling, evidently seeing more profit in removing whole (bad) bodies than just bad teeth. He is supposed to be the good guy, but at times comes through as a self-righteous stuck-up pompous a-- who justifies his actions with pieces of legal documents (warrants) authorizing him to take down outlaws, dead or alive (preferably the former). Jamie Foxx as the eponymous character seems rather stiff and hesitant in the beginning, as if thinking what to do or say next, and only gradually comes out of his shell, as it were, much later in the film, when he's dressed ostentatiously in blue boy costume and astride a noble steed and gets to do a lot of shooting and talking. Leonardo DiCaprio is the delightfully despicable plantation owner Calvin Candie, who enjoys slave fights and black wenches, with a dialogue of high vocabulary to match Schultz's. Other characters do little more than just stand aside as living set decorations. Samuel L Jackson as Stephen is in my opinion the most unforgettable and noteworthy character in the film; he seems to revel in his role as the subservient yet outspoken black mayordomo to Mr Candie ('who dat niggah on dat nag?!'), although coming across as comical and stereotypical Uncle Tom or Stepin Fetchit, he proves to be very perceptive and astute than given credit for - as in the scenes where he correctly deduces that Broomhilda and Django already know each other previously. A lot of the movie is taken up by needless and irrelevant scenes, like the Regulators aka Bag Men (precursors to the KKK), and Django's trip to the Dickey Quint mines in the hands of 3 inept and inefficient mine minions, in which Tarantino has a bit role speaking in a rather atrocious and laughable attempt at Aussie Strine. And to the more historically savvy, there's the numerous anachronisms and factual errors to nitpick at - dynamite, drinking straws, sunglasses and the Henry Repeater rifle, to name a few. But don't let this review put you off from seeing DU. It does have its glorious moments, blood and gore and all. But as with Tarantino films, don't expect a history lesson to base your book report on.",6,2,5,14 March 2013
Clash of the Titans," Release the Crackhead ... that made this film
","That's what I would have yelled out except for the fact that you're not supposed to do so in a movie theatre. Went inside after plonking out extra moolah for 3D and special specs, and 20 minutes into the show, felt like puking and tearing my hair and eyes out simultaneously in protest for being made to sit through this travesty of a remake. 3D glasses did enhance my headache and eyestrain, but not the experience. Awful plot - if there was any, distorted depiction of mythological characters, inclusion of characters that weren't even supposed to be in it (djinns in a Greek myth?), bad acting, even worse dialogue and costumes - Zeus looked like an overaged glam-rock star and Hades the older brother of Voldermort. Kraken doesn't do anything except roar and stand there as if purposely waiting to be turned to stone. Medusa's head should have been turned on everyone involved in the making of this multimillion dollar joke.",1,7,11,11 April 2010
Taken," 'Taken' For A Ride
","I give this flick a thumbs up for the non-stop action and thrills it provides, on the other hand thumbs down for an implausible plot with gunshot plot holes. Liam Neeson plays an ex-CIA agent who calls upon his skills and experiences in the good guys vs bad guys field when his beloved teenage daughter is kidnapped in Paris while on holiday by an Albanian mafia to be sold into prostitution. While his resolute courage and resourcefulness and abilities are not what is called into question, the situations he gets himself into are. Are we to believe that he could easily track down the head of the kidnapping ring based on a brief phone conversation and very vague tips from fellow ex-CIA members? And then there's the fact that he on his lonesome manages to score a round into 35 antagonists, yet he himself escapes with barely a scratch. Albanians, Frenchmen and Arabs must be such lousy shots. The there's the scene when he does get caught by the mob and hung by the wrists from the ceiling, and at the opportune moment, the bolts connecting the pipes he's shackled to give way and he instantly is free of his bonds to tackle the baddies. Perhaps Lady Luck was with him all the way through. Not to mention the incongruous ending where he brings his daughter to singing idol Sheera for voice lessons. After all that she went through, surely she would've suffered a great deal of post-traumatic stress, yet she acts as if the whole thing never happened - or maybe she went to an exceptional skillful head-shrinker. For all that, ignoring what I've just mentioned, just sit back and enjoy the action.",7,0,1,8 October 2012
Les Mis√©rables," Miserable Movie Musical
","Having watched the Broadway version of Les Miserables, I had high hopes that this would be at least an adaptation of the Victor Hugo classic transposed from stage to film, done for the benefit of the hoi polloi who, for various reasons, are unable to witness the stage musical in all its glory. What we get instead is a truncated plot with more holes in it than Swiss cheese and a mishmash of actors and actresses, all professionals and veterans, singing in disharmony and disunity. Oh, well, perhaps I may have overstated. Hugh Jackman does have a pleasant singing voice, and his performance is at best, passable, as there are moments when one can feel the embodiment of Valjean in him, but at other times he is just, well, Jackman. Russell Crowe, while turning out an physically apt menacing presence as Javert, struggles to maintain the high C's (or should that be D's?), and it shows in his facial expressions. Anne Hathaway has a brief but memorable performance as Fantine, her rendition of 'I Dreamed A Dream', while not particularly outstanding imho, does tend to rend at one's heart-strings, especially coupled with her gaunt and pathetic countenance of the factory worker turned prostitute. Most disappointing of all, are the portrayals and performances of the characters the Thenardiers, who are supposed to provide the comic relief to an otherwise dark period of French revolutionary history. They are simply not in any way detestable nor funny, and I question their physical appearances particularly Mme Thenardier (in the novel and stage) is supposed to be a large, dumpy, homely harridan, here in the movie version, she's a buxom (if still dumpy) hussy shamelessly flaunting her wares at the inn's male customers. Mr Thenardier is simply too well-groomed and natty to the point of almost effeminate, and his half-hearted monotonal singing doesn't help either. 'Master of the House' performance, supposedly the highlight of this particular scene, seems a bit rushed and makes little or no impact at all to the point of being forgettable, and neither Sascha Baron-Cohen nor Helena Bonham- Carter seem neither comfortable singing nor enjoying their roles.There are a lot more I could say about this film rendition of a Broadway classic - but that has already been mentioned in other (negative) reviews in IMDb, so I'll not waste words nor space reiterating. the critic review at everythingmusicals.com pretty much sums up my feelings about this film - DON'T BOTHER watching at cinema.",5,1,5,26 February 2013
