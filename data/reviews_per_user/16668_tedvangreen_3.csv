Moneyball," Moneyball is a hit for sports fans
","A must see for any true baseball fans, Moneyball takes a look at more than just the Oakland Athletics. It beautifully mixes Oakland general manager Billy Beane's decision to shake up how he runs his team, with his personal life. Bennett Miller, the director, really causes the viewer to root for not only the A's team from ten years ago, but gives fans reason to root for Beane and the A's in today's season by the end of the film.The Oakland A's are coming off a season in which, although they made the playoffs, they suffered a disappointing loss to the New York Yankees. Unfortunately for Billy Beane, three of his biggest stars leave in free agency. Beane has to find a way to replace his best players, while still staying within the lowest salary cap confines in all of baseball. Beane turns to unconventional methods of replacing lost production.This is where Moneyball, in my opinion, excels. The way Bennett Miller portrays the old school vs. new school ways of thinking is very good. It portrays how many baseball scouts and front office men were stuck in the past where the eye test is all that matters. However Billy Beane and his new assistant Peter Brand, a Yale graduate with a degree in economics, turn to a radical new method of determining player values: saber-metrics, which is looking mainly at certain statistics to determine players value. Many of the old school scouts greatly resent this new method of determining player value and think that Beane is ignoring all of their hard work, especially when Beane sign a slew of unconventional players to help replace the loss of his three stars.The first half of the season does not go well for the Athletics, leading to critics to call Beane's new method of selecting players a failure. This is very frustrating for Beane as he has to win the support of the owners, while pouring every single minute of his life into his job. The problem is that Beane recently got divorced and shares time with his daughter. His increased work responsibilities make it harder for Beane to see his daughter.One of the neatest scenes, if you are a sports-nerd like myself, is the trade deadline scene. It is a very tense few minutes as Beane and Brand attempt to wheel-and-deal with other teams. Miller paints Beane as a powerful general manager to be feared by having him give other GM's deadlines and telling them they are giving up a huge opportunity.However the turning point of the film definitely is the streak. After struggling to compete in the first half of the season, the team rips off a 20 game win streak which is the longest in A.L. history. At this point in the film, there is a general consensus being reached that Beane's experiment with saber-metrics have worked as the A's are roaring towards the playoffs. Although they may lose to the twins in the post season, almost everyone around baseball generally agrees that saber-metrics is here to stay and is probably the future.The end of the film has Beane meeting with the owners of the Boston Red Sox, who offer him the largest contract for a general manager at the time. This is the hardest decision Beane has to make of the whole film. He could go to Boston and take the money and help remake that once great team into contenders again, or he could stay near his daughter, and finish what he started in Oakland. In the end, he ends up choosing to stay in Oakland, after listening to a CD of his daughter singing and thanking him for being a great Dad. After the film ends, the reader learns that Beane stays in Oakland to finish what he started and to win a World Series there. They also learn that the Red Sox have won two world series in the last decade using a strategy similar to that of Beane's. By including this information, the director causes the viewers to feel sympathy for Beane and makes the viewer hope that the Athletics can win a World Series with Beane at the helm.Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill perform very well in the roles of Billy Beane and Peter Brand respectively. This is a great film to see if you have a genuine interest in baseball or even sports.",9,2,3,21 September 2014
42," 42 hits it out of the park
","Jackie Robinson is one of the most important African American athletes, if not the most important. This movie perfectly demonstrates all the injustices Jackie had to deal with. Whether it is being denied a hotel room, or having to deal with opposing managers or even teammates. However, this movie shows the good along with the bad. It shows that, while there were plenty of people who were out to prevent Jackie from laying, the people who were their to help him were doing the right thing. I also enjoyed it because it was not your typical sports movie. The Dodgers do not win the World Series, and we do not get to see Robinson play out the rest of his career. The movie does not sugarcoat to much, it portrays what really happens, and how Jackie was really treated. It may be a movie, but it does a very good job at showing a very important piece of sports history. This movie perfectly blends sports and culture, and that is what makes it such a good movie.",8,1,3,21 December 2014
Inside Man," Quite possibly the perfect crime
","Is it possible to pull off the perfect crime? According to this movie, directed by Spike Lee, it is. The movie opens with a man, Dalton Russell(Clive Owen) in what appears to be a cell explaining how he created and executed the perfect crime and begins to describe it. A group of masked figures with assault weapons enters the bank and holds everyone inside hostage, and police swarm the area. From here on out the movie intertwines the events of the bank robbery, and flash forwards to the police interrogating all the witnesses. This is important because in the end it turns out that when everything is over, no money was stolen, no robbers apprehended, and their weapons turned out to be plastic. This peaks the interest of the head investigator, Keith Frazier(Denzel Washington). He decides to investigate the bank owner even further. What does he find out? You have to watch the movie to find that out.",8,2,2,15 October 2014
