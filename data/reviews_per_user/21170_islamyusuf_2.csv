The Incredible Hulk," The Incredible Hulk is Better If Sick
",The Incredible Hulk is 56%The acting was either very lifeless and boring or it was to excited and exaggerated.The film had pacing issues. Lots of the scenes in the movie felt a little too long and could have easily been shorter.Overall the film has issues but is just barely good enough for me.,6,0,0,14 March 2018
