Casablanca," Bergman. Bogart. As Time Goes By. Word: Priceless
","Casablanca is want so many claim to be the best of all time. Whenever I listen to this movie and I hear 'As Time Goes By', I start to blubber. The script, direction, and camera work is absolutely amazing. Bergman and Bogart were amazing also and looked like they were meant for their parts. I found it so gripping when they were on screen together. What a dynamic duo. The story between Rick and Ilsa was so compelling in every way. The story also led into the narrative of Victor Laszlo (Henreid) and Sam (played by the superb Dooley Wilson who sang 'As Time Goes By'). Another great part of the movie was in Rick's bar club where Ilsa and Rick met again in Casablanca. But as far as the songs, plot and characters go, I thought the utmost part of the movie that made me think 'wow' was without a doubt the ending. The ending was so action-packed and heart-pounding it almost took my breath away.Overall, Casablanca is a timeless classic that will never go by our minds.",1,19,87,16 April 2005
