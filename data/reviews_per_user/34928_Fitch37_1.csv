Kill Bill: Vol. 2," I liked the separation of one movie
","I liked the ending of the first when bill said that her baby was still alive.  I think that Quentin Tarrintino is a genius when it comes to making movies.  I loved Kill Bill 1 and I loved Kill Bill 2, I know that they are the same movie, but he really did a good job in separating them.  The only thing that I can say that I didn't like is the fight with Bill at the end where Uma does the five pressure point exploding heart thing.  I also didn't like the training that she did with the chinese guy, it reminded me of that show on Comedy Central BONZAI when he kept on moving his beard.  With the whole effect.  But overall I still will probably go buy both volumes to add to my Tarrentino collection.  I think that people try to analyze things to much, it was a great movie, end of story.  If it wasn't so great and all the people making bad comments on it, then it wouldn't have a 8.5 only after being out for a week.
