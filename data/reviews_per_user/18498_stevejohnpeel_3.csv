The Monuments Men," A lot of nothing really!
","First off, it looks good, it looks like you could almost be there, great backgrounds, props and locations. But as the movie rolls on, it soon becomes clear that there is not story.Well, a bit of a background is included with regard to a group being sent to rescue art in WW2, but that's it. Nothing actually happens. The group of men travel and find art.You can't get into any member of the group, as each of them are weak and have no real importance other than being a member of the group, you can't feel sorry for them, happy for them, or even worry about any one of them.With what looks like a huge budget when you see the movie making and cast, turns out to be a load of rubbish that is hard to sit and watch.",3,1,1,5 May 2014
Deadpool 2," Turned it off after half and hour, it was just too painful.
","I was so looking forward to this second movie, the first was just fantastic.The second movie was nothing but: Look at me, I'm Ryan Reynolds and I hate the new administration and the whole Trump family.So many attacks against the president and his family, and although I was fully aware Reynolds was the star, that didn't bother me, I can usually shake that kind of thing off, but it was too much.The close ups, the bad jokes, the mayhem, were all really bad. Too much time was taken up with Republican attacks and I just had to turn it off. The first film was great.",1,51,120,6 August 2018
12 Years a Slave," I really enjoyed it.
","Another American slave story. This slave was a free man in the North and put into slavery in the South.For a good slave story for me, it has to be more than just shocking scenes, it has to actually have a great story.Based on a true story, it was as you would imagine, slaves being beaten and killed while working in the cotton fields. Yep, it's all in there as usual, rape and abuse aplenty, but even though it is so similar to others, it is still a really good watch.Yes it was pretty much the same old, but I really enjoyed it showing this mans holding on to his dream of being reunited with his family, and made me think what all those other slaves who's families were much further away than the North must have been feeling.",8,0,2,20 February 2014
