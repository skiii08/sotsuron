The Mask," Somebody stop that Jim!
","This was the movie that got me into Jim Carrey (though I'd seen him on 'In Living Color' a couple of times), and it's still my favorite, though Ace Ventura #1 was also kind of funny.The great thing about this film is that Jim is actually really restrained all throughout, only going into goof ball mode when he puts on the Mask. He's pretty likable and engaging here, not quite as prone to irritating some audience members like he did in 'Batman Forever' and 'Ace Ventura #2'. Cameron Diaz... my God, she looked SO GOOD here, how have her looks faded so quickly since this film? She looks so... plastic now, kind of like a giant Barbie doll.One of the big standout scenes in this one is Jim singing 'Cuban Pete' to escape all the cops. Not that the other Mask gags are unfunny, but Cuban Pete really stands out. Too bad the cartoon Mask didn't have a little more restraint to it.",8,57,68,13 February 2004
Gremlins," 'They're watching Snow White... and they love it.'
","When a traveling gizmo maker picks up a cute, furry little creature - who is later named Gizmo - to give to his son for Christmas, he inadvertently unleashes Hell on Earth when a bunch more of the furry little bastards start showing up and trick the son into feeding them after midnight (one of the big no-no's in having these creatures, in addition to keeping them out of the sunlight and keeping them away from water) which causes them to mutate into horrific monsters who embark on a black comic rampage that results in the death of a few cops, one local Santa, and an evil, bitchy old woman that nobody liked. Getting them wet only makes it worse because they multiply from water. Sunlight, actually any extreme light, causes pain and eventual death. So with a little help from Gizmo and his girlfriend, the son sets out to right this horrendous wrong and eventually the Chinese owner of Gizmo comes by to reclaim him.Too intense for little kids, more for teenagers, young adults and adults. Who would have guessed that this would be the springboard of Chris Columbus's career? Surprisingly entertaining but not for all.",Null,0,1,22 April 2004
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An epicly lifeless film...
","The day I went to see this back in the summer of 1999, aged 15, was the day I felt my innocence shattered. I had so greatly been looking forward to this film and was so excited to have a Star Wars I could call my own (as in made in my generation) only to be given this piece of garbage.
The actors, including heavy weights like Liam Neeson and Samuel L. Jackson, up and comers Natalie Portman, and gradually progressing into leading man status Ewan McGregor, are all wasted here. Neeson, McGregor and Jackson are OK but OK is all they are, but they don't stand out at all, nor does Portman. All I can say of Jake Lloyd is that he looks like he's having fun. Then there's Jar Jar Binks, ARGH. What was Lucas thinking? And poor Darth Maul got killed before we had a chance to get to know him.
But what's most offensive of all, aside from the lifeless/passionless acting, are the continuity errors. All these years we were led to believe that Obi-Wan (McGregor) risked a lot to make Anakin a Jedi Knight, but here Obi-Wan's little more than a 2nd banana lurking in the background, while Qui-Gon Jinn (Neeson) is at the front line doing what he can to get Anakin ahead, and it's just wrong. That was what hurt me the most, the fact that the film wasn't about Obi-Wan, that it didn't adhere to previous Star Wars history.And Episode 2, alas, isn't that big of an improvement.",1,7,12,5 June 2003
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Phantom Piece of Crap
","This is all special effects and no real story. Top notch actors like Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Samuel L. Jackson are forced spew out horrible dialogue and, even worse, they aren't even allowed to spew out the horrible dialogue with passion. Jar Jar Binks is an insult to human intellect as we know it; he doesn't even look like a real creature. In fact, none of the digital characters here do. The backgrounds look real enough, but the digital characters just don't look real. George Lucas has become so blown over by how much easier computers make it that he forgot you still have to make it look real. Not to mention that the story just plain sucks, undermining everything we knew about Star Wars from the first trilogy. It should have been all about the young Obi-Wan Kenobi and him meeting Anakin and them going places and doing stuff. Shame on you, George Lucas.",1,6,11,4 April 2003
Ali," 'I AM the greatest!'
","Ambitious biopic about famous boxer Muhammad Ali, chronicling the high points and low points of both his personal and professional career - his many boxing triumphs, his troubled relationships with the women he loved, his refusal to fight in Vietnam ('Man,I ain't got no quarrel with them Viet Cong.'), his religious beliefs, problems with his family, etc.
At times he looks like he's doing little more than a stiff impersonation of Ali, but Will Smith is mostly pretty good in the role of the famed boxer with a big mouth who got away with having the big mouth because he had the goods to back it up. There's also good acting from Jon Voight as Ali's most avid newsman follower Howard Cosell and Mario Van Peebles in the role of Malcolm X.The boxing scenes are also well done, even when you know that Ali/Smith is going to come out on top. There are times when looking at the film I almost felt like I was watching 'Black Hawk Down' in terms of the film's lighting.",Null,0,1,23 April 2004
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The best of them all...
","Out of the entire trilogy, this one is probably the best of the bunch, but then again the first one usually is. Our hero, affable archeologist adventurer and Nazi slayer Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford in the role that will no doubt be what he's best remembered for when he's gone) joins forces with old flame Marion (Karen Allen) and Cairo based digger pal Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) in a race to get the Lost Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis get it. Chaos and mayhem ensues.After a slightly boring 20 minute gap from the opening to the first shoot out in the snow bound bar, this is a fairly well paced adventure that pits you against spiders, ghosts, the Atlantic ocean, and Pat Roach. Parents be advised though: some of this is not for kids.",10,0,0,16 December 2003
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Cartoon noir?
","I never realized it as a kid, but this film had more innuendo than you could shake a stick at - or carrot.Disguising his British accent effortlessly, Bob Hoskins plays a down and out 1947 circa detective who was once a great champion of cartoon stars until his brother was killed by one. He is asked by animation film maker RK Maroon to trail cartoon owner Marvin Acme, who owns 'Toon Town' and take incriminating pictures of him to show to a popular yet hapless cartoon rabbit by name of Roger (RK is Roger's boss and lately Roger can't seem to concentrate). The subject of the pictures: Roger's ravishing red haired wife Jessica (voice of an unbilled Kathleen Turner) with Marvin Acme! This understandably rattles Roger, who thinks his wife is 'Betty Crocker', even though she happens to be a sultry singer at the Ink & Paint Club. But when Marvin turns up dead, Bob is forced to help Roger find the real culprit when Roger is believed to be the killer, which clashes with his image as the hapless straight man/rabbit to the crude, cigar chomping yet adorable cartoon character Baby Herman. But who IS the real culprit and why did they do it? And can Bob solve the case and save Roger before he is destroyed by the inhuman Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) and his cartoon Weesles?
Loaded with gags, in joke references to both 1940s cartoons and the film noir private eye detective films that starred Humphrey Bogart, and making an almost seamless blend between live action actors and animated figures, this is one of the most entertaining pieces to come along in the history of cinema. Bob Hoskins holds his own admirably while playing 2nd fiddle to the hapless Roger and his cartoon pals.",10,0,0,15 April 2004
Unbreakable," Unbroken
","Interesting though sometimes dull, dreary film about troubled security guard Bruce Willis finding out that he's actually a super hero, minus the tights. Samuel L. Jackson plays the man who finds this out and may or may not be up to some devious dirty work of his own. Also thrown in are Bruce's wife and his son.Like I said, an interesting film but it never quite comes together and it's story just sort of wanders around like a stray dog. Worth a rental though not necessarily a purchase.It probably didn't do much for comic book sales either. If anything, a film like this is bound to give comic books a bad name.The director seems to have an obsession with water.",Null,0,1,9 April 2004
Star Trek," Fun if slightly fan fictional
","PLOT IN A NUTSHELL: When a blood thirsty Romulan named Nero (Eric Bana) and his crew arrive in the 23rd century, they set off a chain of events that will drastically alter the original Trek time-line as fans and casual general audiences knew it, and could possibly jeopardize the chance of James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) to become the hero that fans remember him being in the original series.As an adrenaline fueled summer thrill ride, the film works very well, packing all the action that a 21st century can buy, and a mostly well rounded cast keeps you invested. Zachary Quinto in particular is a bullseye casting choice to be the new Spock. True he doesn't sound like Leonard Nimoy (who stars as 'Spock Prime'), but he looks almost exactly like a younger Leonard Nimoy and he captures the general personality of Spock so well that you don't really care that he lacks Nimoy's distinctively deep, gravelly voice.However there are some things holding the film back from true greatness. As another critic pointed out (more than several others I'll bet), the young Spock leaving the young Kirk marooned on the ice planet (a reference to Hoth in the Empire Strikes Back) would undoubtedly have landed the Vulcan science officer in all kinds of hot water, even if Kirk was a pain in the ass to deal with. Then there is another matter - Kirk becoming Captain without logging in any actual pre-captaincy hours. I can believe that Kirk was a trouble making brat who then grew up to be an angry young man so drunk on his own arrogance and self-pity that he just doesn't care who he offends or who he hurts, and I can even believe that Kirk and Spock initially disliked each other when they first met, but Kirk becoming a Captain when he hadn't even logged in any real work hours is a little too much to swallow. This is the kind of writing that gives fan fiction a bad name. Does Starfleet have no command structure? Surely there must have been older, more experienced officers just waiting to get the green-light for captaincy. We can only speculate as to how JJ Abrams will address this in the sequel.On the whole an entertaining venture, but will probably play better for casual moviegoers than die hard Star Trek fans.",7,0,4,1 October 2010
Inglourious Basterds," 'I don't suppose you'll mind if I go out speaking the King's.'
","PLOT (or lack thereof): A group of Jewish American soldiers, led by Brad Pitt, go overseas to during World War 2 to terrorize and massacre Nazis while a Jewish cinema owner, the only survivor of her family, having barely escaped a German soldier known as 'The Jew Hunter' played Christopher Waltz, who now plots to have her revenge when a film about a German sharp shooter is forced upon her to debut at her theater, while Waltz plans defection.The film is really nothing but another exercise on director Quentin Tarantino's part to see just how much useless dialogue he can cram into a scene and see how long he can drag a scene out before the audience gives up and turns the film off (similar to his misguided 'Death Proof'). Where Tarantino's earlier films, affectionate deconstructions of the noir genre, had enough chaotic energy to keep the viewer engaged while his characters blathered nonsense, much of it pop culture and cinema laced, this time around, like Death Proof, Tarantino fails to bring any of that lost energy to the proceedings. The film is dull, inert, and lifeless. Scenes drag on pointlessly with no real tension, in no small part because the characters are cardboard cut outs. Even Christopher Waltz's much ballyhooed and frankly overrated performance as the 'Jew Hunter' Nazi fails to set off any sparks. The fact that the character is more annoying than interesting doesn't help.Brad Pitt and his 'Basterds' aren't even in the film that much. While the marketing campaign suggested a darkly comic take on the Magnificent Seven formula, the truth is the that Pitt and the 'Basterds' are barely plot devices.Trust me, you won't miss much by skipping this inglorious mess.",1,64,114,27 July 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Pirates 2: Aquatic Boogaloo
","Plot in a nutshell - picking up where 'Curse of the Black Pearl' left off, the Black Pearl's Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) must try to worm his way out of a deal with the Flying Dutchman, Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). With a price on their heads, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and his star-crossed virgin lover Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), are both forced to help Jack after the evil Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hallander) arrests them both and blackmails them to get Jack, or rather, his compass. The unexpected wild card is former Commodore James Norrington (Jack Davenport), who's life has pretty much fallen apart after getting caught in a storm pursuing Jack following the events of the last movie, and one way or another he's either going to get his revenge or get his old life back, no matter the cost.Sequels are a tricky business. It's so hard to live up to the first one, let alone surpass it. More often than not, sequels often just feel like vain imitations/remakes/rehashes of the films that spawned them as the same basic formula is usually just flogged to death (Rocky's 2-5 and Matrix's Reloaded/Revolution come to mind here). There are exceptions, such as 'The Empire Strikes Back', but they are few and far between. For the most part I enjoyed 'Dead Man's Chest' but I cannot deny that the original film was superior.The biggest sin of 'Dead Man's Chest' is that it runs too long and tries to over-stuff itself, cutting back & forth between Jack Sparrow's antics, the misfortunes of Will or the misfortunes of Elizabeth, which then leads us to the misfortunes of Norrington, with a lot of action thrown in, whereas the first film had a more focused, driven feel to it. I saw the film with my dad and he commented that it felt like they took a book, ripped out the most interesting/exciting parts and then pasted it together in no particular order. Most criminally, the storyline with Will catching up with the sea zombie version of his father Bootstrap Bill Turner (Stellan Skarsgard buried under tons of prosthetic makeup & CGI) is probably the most interesting storyline going in the movie, but it deserves more time than it ultimately gets. The decision to turn Norrington into a full blown evil bastard was unexpected - I know he wasn't exactly the hero of the first film, but he wasn't the villain either, just the romantic rival (I blame this on the fact that they cut scenes that were meant to establish him as a nicer guy). The thing with Elizabeth becoming infatuated with Jack, or at least appearing to become infatuated with him, was a relatively minor offense but still an annoying one. It felt like the writers were trying too hard to both play to the popularity of Depp/Jack and also to try and resurrect the opposites attract magic of Princess Leia & Han Solo, the primary difference being that Solo was taller, better looking, had better equipment and had better hygiene than Sparrow. That seemed to go against part of Elizabeth's realizations in the first film that pirates weren't all they were cracked up to be, and she struck me as being smarter than to fall for an obvious scoundrel like Jack. Or maybe I'm just over-reacting to their decision to put the young lovebirds fate in doubt. And there are some who will undoubtedly be annoyed by the cliff-hanger setting up 'Pirates 3: The Pirate Version of the Search For Spock'.Okay, stuff I actually did like... there were some genuinely funny moments (some of which were overplayed), the action set pieces were well staged & well executed (if a little over the top), and the actors were generally good. Johnny Depp basically rehashes his performance from the first film, which works well enough since he still appears to be having fun as the drunken glam rocker pirate. Orlando Bloom is good in his usual low-key way (though he's basically got himself typecast as the earnest young hero and will probably spend the rest of his career being accused of just playing himself in every film he does).Nighy & Starsgard were good along with the rest of the undead crew, though they are basically a steroid fueled remake of the undead crew from 'Curse'. Keira Knightley was alright, though in a few scenes it felt like she was trying too hard (namely the ones where she's supposed to act like she's becoming infatuated with Jack). I guess I'm not being very positive here, am I? Well, if I make the film out to be worse than it actually is, I'm sorry. Just go in knowing that it's not as bad as the Star Wars prequel trilogy, Batman & Robin, Daredevil, Elektra, 2005 Fantastic Four and Catwoman.Now go hide the rum.",6,2,3,22 August 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," The Mummy on the high seas
","When I saw the 2nd trailer for this film, I thought to myself that it was 'The Mummy' done at sea with pirates instead of in Egypt with mummies. But that's not a bad thing necessarily; this film is fun in an over the top, tongue in cheek kind of way. More a parody of pirate films than a real pirate film itself.Many people say that Johnny Depp makes this film as Captain Jack Sparrow, and while he certainly is fun to watch, every goofball needs a straight man to play off of, and Orlando 'Legalos' Bloom does that about as well as anyone else out there would have. Oh and Keira Knightley is hot.The plot concerns Miss Keira being kidnapped by pirates (the ringleader played by Geoffrey Rush) who think that her blood will break a nasty curse hanging over them, all they need is to cut her hand open on the gold medallion in her possession by way of Orlando. The only problem is that it's actually Orlando Bloom's blood they need, not Keira's. But no one is aware of this right away so Orlando busts Johnny Depp out of jail and he agrees to help Orlando rescue the woman he loves.Chaos and mayhem ensues. It's fun!",10,0,1,18 July 2003
Stripes," Bill wants you!
","Bored buddies Bill Murray and Harold Ramis (pre-Ghostbusters) join the army and, along with Judge Reinhold and the late John Candy, are tormented by drill sergeant Warren Oates and fall in love with cutie pie army girls P.J. Soles and Sean Young (before she did 'Blade Runner'), respectively. Later the two unlikely soldiers become heroes when they make use of a secret weapon army vehicle to rescue their pals.Bill is funny as usual, and so is Harold in a role very different from his trademark character, Ego Spengler of 'Ghostbusters'. P.J. Soles and Sean Young (almost unrecognizable and considered by some to be the more 'plain' of the two) have little to do except look pretty, but it is funny watching P.J. emerge from a box in her underwear moaning as though she'd just had love made to her by James Bond.John Candy has a memorable mud wrestling scene to boot.",Null,0,1,14 April 2004
12 Angry Men," 'This isn't a game!'
","Excellent if dated examination of personal prejudices, selfishness, hesitance, past mistakes, and responsibility when lone juror Henry Fonda tries to get his fellow jurors to take the time to talk about the trial a little more before condemning a boy accused of murdering his father to death by vote of 'guilty'.Remade as a TV movie starring the late Jack Lemmon (in the Fonda role), the late George C. Scott (in the Lee J. Cobb role) and Tony Danza as the guy who just wants to go to the ball game. The TV movie had a few modern updates such as making the jury more ethnically balanced, a Hispanic guy on trial and a lady judge (Mary McDonnell of 'Dances With Wolves'). The prejudice examined in the remake was more racial, where as the prejudice of the original film had more to do with where a kid was raised and how the young and the old differ.Both are great, however, with a hot, stuffy atmosphere that'll make you sweat even in the middle of winter. Fonda delivers one of his best performances as the one juror who's taken into consideration the fact that they have another human being's life in their hands and is unhappy with how the trial was handled. The other angry men are good as well, but Lee J. Cobb stands out in particular as the stubborn one who condemns the suspect not so much because he thinks he's guilty but more from his own failed attempt to raise his own son.",Null,0,1,23 April 2004
Spider-Man 2," Spider-Man Returns
","Picking up where #1 left off, Peter Parker (Maguire) still can't get a break - his jobs suck, he can't keep up with his college work, his financial situation is getting worse both for him and his sweet old Aunt May, his childhood friend Harry Osborne (Franco) is growing more and more disconnected from his humanity as well as his friendship as he becomes more and more obsessed with destroying Spider-Man for killing his father Norman (Willem DaFoe) from the first film, unaware that Norman was the Green Goblin, and of course, Peter is still longing and lusting after Mary-Jane Watson (Dunst), who is now engaged to his boss J. Jonah Jameson's astronaut son John. In fact, the stress and strife of all this unhappiness is taking such a toll on Peter that his powers as Spider-Man are beginning to go on and off like a faulty light. Though he still feels guilty about the fact that it was pretty much his fault that his dear old Uncle Ben got killed in #1 - and it was this guilt that has been his driving force in being Spider-Man - Peter is sick and tired of having to put everything and everyone else in his life on hold because the job of being Spider-Man has him fighting the forces of evil left & right. When his powers apparently turn themselves off permanently, Peter decides to take his life back and throws out the Spider-Man suit, and for a time, he's happy just living like an ordinary person, catching up on his college work and what not, although that doesn't change the fact that Mary-Jane is still engaged to John Jameson and can't simply throw that away just because her favorite boy is now ready, willing and able. As if feeling guilty about the fact that he can no longer defend the innocents of New York isn't enough, into this comes Dr. Otto Octavious (Molina), once a jolly, good natured mad scientist who naturally only had the best of intentions, his big experiment, funded by Harry Osborne no less, boasting that Octavious's genius will 'Put Oscorp on the map in a way my father could have never dreamed.', turns Octavious into an unhinged villain dubbed Dr. Octopus/Doc Ock, who goes on a crime spree to get the money & materials he needs to finish his work. Naturally, Peter gets his powers working again and becomes Spider-Man again, but will Spider-Man be able to stop Doc Ock? Even more important - will he be able to win back Mary-Jane?Slightly over long and sometimes erring on the side of the melodramatic, and erring on the absurdity of unmasking Spider-Man not once, not twice, but three times, this is still an entertaining roller coaster with eye-popping violence and reasonably sincere characters. Here's hoping Topher Grace doesn't wreck #3.",6,0,1,24 May 2006

","Batman's back and still taking a back seat (bat-seat?) to his villains, this time the Penguin and Catwoman. Michael Keaton recycles his previous performance to good extent and he's well matched with Michelle Pfeifer as Catwoman and Danny DeVito as the Penguin, but once again the plot can't seem to make up its mind on where its going and what it's trying to be.
And why are the Penguin's thugs crazed clowns? Shouldn't they have been working for the Joker? Well, in any case, this dark romp of madness should leave action seekers happy.",Null,0,0,7 February 2004
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Frustrating
","The long awaited solo Wolverine film which Marvel & Fox were apparently grooming their clawed hero for as far back as the first X-Men film, and there's no denying that there was always a favoritism towards him in the previous X-Men films. Ultimately it proves to be a very watered down, very uneven & unsatisfying account of how Wolverine came to be what he is.The film's sins? Well, it doesn't go nearly as far as it promised it would in showing Wolverine's darker, more savage side, there are humorous moments that don't really belong in the film, characters such as a much younger Cyclops & Gambit (for some reason Gambit is made older than Cyclops, which also makes it impossible to ever do a proper Gambit/Rogue coupling if they follow this continuity) are thrown in just for the Hell of it even though they have nothing to do with Wolverine's origin, the film doesn't mesh very well with the continuity of the previous films, and overall there is an unpleasant sense of style over substance, which has become an unfortunate issue with Fox films ever since Tom Rothman started working there (remember the hack job he put on the Fantastic Four, Daredevil & Elektra films?). And don't get me started on those bullets.The film's redeeming factors? Well, the over supplied eye candy is well executed. There is some competent acting from the lead Hugh Jackman (in his 4th outing as the clawed one), Liev Schreiber as Victor Creed (AKA: Sabertooth) and Danny Huston as a younger Col. Stryker, making it more bearable than say 'Spider-Man 3' (or even the above mentioned films that suffered at Tom Rothman's misguided hands), but Jackman's steely charisma combined with the strong support of Schreiber & Huston can only do so much against poor dialogue and an uneven tone.Overall, a disappointment.",1,7,16,5 May 2009
Troy," The 'Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves' of sword and sandal films?
","When I first saw the trailer for 'Troy' and heard that Brad Pitt was playing Achilles, I thought to myself 'This is going to end up being like 'Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves', a film that looks great and has some good actors but it's all offset by a crucial casting error - Brad Pitt as Achilles.' To my surprise, I actually enjoyed 'Troy' but I still couldn't get my head around the casting of Brad Pitt as Achilles, except that director Wolfgang Petersen admired Pitt's work in 'Fight Club' and used 'Troy' as an excuse to work with him. Had this film been made 15 years ago, Brad Pitt probably would have played Paris of Troy. Let me get something straight first though: I don't hate Brad Pitt. I'm not a fan of Brad Pitt but I don't hate him either. I understand that women think Brad Pitt is sex on legs and that has been the big factor in his success, but he's also worked hard over the years to prove that he's more than just a pretty face with odd-ball characterizations including 'Snatch' and 'Fight Club'. While I commend Pitt for his efforts, I must also acknowledge that being able to play psychopaths doesn't automatically qualify him to play a mythological character, least of all Achilles. I always pictured Achilles as a man who looks like a force of nature, rough and rugged. Pitt clearly hit the weight room, but even at age 40 his face is still too boyish and pretty to really compliment his character. Pitt's performance isn't terrible but it's a mixed bag at best; Pitt gives his all most of the time, but some scenes he's just not trying, like when he refuses to fight the second day of the war after King Agamemnon (Brian Cox) takes Briseis (Rose Byrne) from him. Brad Pitt drives a chariot as though he were Charlton Heston in 'Ben-Hur', but Pitt is no Charlton Heston.Well, in this loose adaptation of Homer's 'The Iliad', the aforementioned Agamemnon of Mycenae has gotten pretty much everyone in Greece to join him, with the foreign country Troy being the only rival left. His little brother, however, King Meneleaus of Sparta (Brendan Gleeson) is tired of battle and wants peace with Troy, which he thinks he's established with Princes Hector (Eric Bana) and Paris (Orlando Bloom). What Meneleaus doesn't know is that Paris has been having a week long fling with his wife Helen (Diane Kruger). Paris, being as stupid as he is, smuggles Helen back to Troy to be his wife, which pisses off Meneleaus and prompts the Trojan War, led by Meneleaus and Agamemnon. In addition to King Odysseus of Ithica, AKA: Ulysses (Sean Bean), Achilles is also joining the fray, even though he and Agamemnon don't like each other. Agamemnon hates Achilles because he's kind of a jerk who fights only for himself and Achilles hates Agamemnon because he thinks the king is a power mad coward who won't fight his own battles (in other words, he has no honor as Achilles would define it). Achilles joins the fray only for the glory of his own name and as a favor to his pal Odysseus, the only man he'll listen to. Achilles wins Agamemnon the beach on their first day, but he gets mad when Agamemnon seizes his girl, the spunky Briseis for no apparent reason except that he's a dirty old man and perhaps to annoy Achilles (in 'The Iliad', it was compensation). Helen thinks of giving herself back to the Spartans in order to protect Paris and Troy, but she is denied that. The lovable family man warrior Hector doesn't want a war and begs his dad King Priam of Troy (Peter O'Toole) to give Helen back to the Greeks, but Priam believes that they can win because of their walls and the fact that they've got Apollo God of the Sun on their side. Hell Hector's first impulse was to sail back to Sparta and give Helen back and beg Meneleaus for forgiveness and then take Paris home and beat some sense into him, but Paris stubbornly refused to let her go unless he went with her and he didn't want his little idiot brother to get killed. Paris tries take responsibility for his actions by challenging Meneleaus to a duel, but despite being younger and quicker Paris is no match for Meneleaus and just as he is about to be killed he turns and scampers away, shaming himself and the family. A further enraged Meneleaus tries to kill Paris but Hector, on familial reflex, whips out his sword and stabs Meneleaus. That pisses off Agamemnon and a big battle is waged without Achilles and his forces, and Hector and the Trojans beat the Greeks back and even kill the power-house Ajax (Tyler Mane) in the process. Paris is ashamed of himself for being a hypocrite and a coward and shaming the family, and despite Helen's attempts to console him, he resolves that he must reclaim at least some of his dignity and pride by getting in touch with his inner elf (sorry, couldn't resist) and starts boning up on his archery. Achilles eventually gets Briseis back in return for his services and steps in just as she's about to be gang raped by some Greeks. Well, Achilles infatuation with Briseis has softened him up and he decides to take his men back home, which annoys his cousin Patroclus (originally just a friend and ally), who feels like they're turning their back on their countrymen.Given Achilles refusal to fight Agamemnon, Patroclus takes it upon himself to fight in Achilles place and leads their men into battle, wearing Achilles armor, as the cavalry against the advancing Trojans, but he is killed by Hector. No one is exactly happy about this except Agamemnon, who counts on using Achilles rage to get rid of one of their biggest obstacles: Hector. Predictably, Achilles goes after Hector, thirsting for revenge despite Briseis begging him not to fight Hector because he's her cousin and the two men fight each other before Troy. Hector fights valiantly but in the end he is killed by Achilles and then dragged away tied to Achilles chariot. Priam later comes before Achilles and begs for his son's body and Achilles eventually agrees, promising him 12 days of peace as well as returning Briseis and complimenting Priam - 'You're a far better king than the one leading this war.' Agamemnon is annoyed with the peace but Odysseus uses it as the chance to plan - by building the Trojan horse that they will hide in and offer up as a kind of gift of surrender to Troy. Achilles tells his first officer to take the men home while he fights a personal battle.The Trojan Horse is built and left for the Trojans to find. Paris has a bad feeling and suggests burning it, but Priam is convinced by his Irish priest (Nigel Terry, King Arthur in 'Excalibur') to take the thing home. After the celebration, Odysseus and his men open the gates and the Greeks attack, while Achilles searches the city for Briseis. Priam is stabbed in the back by Agamemnon, and Agamemnon is killed by Briseis. Paris gives the sword of Troy to Aeneas and tells him to lead the others out, including Helen, while he searches for his father and happens upon Achilles as he is about to take Briseis and shoots him down with his arrows, thus avenging Hector. Paris and Briseis disappear into the night but we do not know if they escape or not. The film ends with Achilles being burned and Odysseus being philosophical.Like 'Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves' the film is epically mounted and features some great actors, but Brad Pitt kind of offsets things (though he's not as bad as Achilles as Kevin Costner was as Robin Hood). The film works hard at first to keep from having a specific villain, but Brian Cox's campy Agamemnon comes very close to being 'the bad guy'. The best of the lot is Eric Bana as the heroic everyman Prince Hector (though he might have made a better Achilles than Brad Pitt) and Peter O'Toole as King Priam, who has one of the film's most touching scenes: begging for his son's corpse. Let's face it, to the world, Orlando Bloom will ALWAYS be Legalos, and he certainly is so when he picks up the bow and arrow for the climax, but his performance is passable, as there are hints of an actor trying to escape his boyish appearance. He doesn't look quite angry enough when he watches Hector die, but he sounds pretty mad when people dance around the Trojan Horse ('Look at them... you'd think their prince had never died.') Diane Kruger is a decent Helen and she and Bloom work hard to make their characters sympathetic despite their actions. Sean Bean is good but under-used as Odysseus, as is Brendan Gleeson as Meneleaus. Saffron Burrows makes the most of her role as Hector's wife, as does Rose Byrne as Briseis.Some good music by James Horner (who scored the Star Trek films) and well mounted battle scenes similar to if not on par with 'Lord of the Rings'.",6,4,8,20 May 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," 'Do you think he plans it out, or does he just make it up as he goes along?'
","PLOT: Picking up where 'Dead Man's Chest' left off, the resurrected Barbosa allies with Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann and the other various pirates as well as Tia Dalma in order to rescue the deceased Jack Sparrow from the locker of Davy Jones, while Jones' heart has fallen into the clutches of the diabolical Lord Cutler Beckett. With Jack back in action, and drunk as ever, the 9 Pirate Lords must come together to fight Beckett, Jones and get back on good terms with the goddess Calypso, but who is Calypso, and what is her connection to Davy Jones? Can Will rescue his dad Bootstrap Bill from Davy Jones and consummate his relationship with Elizabeth? Will Jack lose the Black Pearl to Barbosa yet again? All this and more await you! 'Curse of the Black Pearl' is still the best of these films, but this is still a more entertaining venture than 'Dead Man's Chest', an able adventure marred by over-length and too many subplots and an attempt to 'epic' that went against the series' winking at the audience style sense of humor. Eye popping visuals & violence abound with the relaxed cast having a grand old time, especially Geoffrey Rush as Barbosa.",7,3,6,23 July 2007
X-Men," 'Mankind is not evil, just uninformed.'
","That's what Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart, Captain Picard of 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' fame) said of human beings in a scene ultimately deleted from the theatrical film but used in one of the trailers.
Based on the popular Marvel Comic book, this somewhat overlong, surprisingly un-action packed but not completely uninteresting film chronicles the exploits of runaway misfit Rogue (a miscast Anna Paquin) before she acquires the powers of flight and super strength and brawling loner Logan, AKA: Wolverine (Hugh Jackman, in the role that made him a star) and their crossing paths with the X-Men and joining them to help thwart magnet master Magneto's (Ian McKellan, Gandalf of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy) evil scheme to mutate human beings so that all life on Earth can be united in commonly being mutants. Then again, unification doesn't sound quite so bad after all. Magneto's reasoning, of course, is that there can no longer be prejudice against mutants if everyone is a mutant. Ironically, as this film depicts it, mutants will eventually inherit the Earth anyway because they are, after all, the next step in human evolution.And in real life, the mutants probably would have taken over the world by now, but for the sake of drama, mutants are made just slightly less powerful enough to keep them from completely taking over the world.
Now this isn't a bad film, but as a comic book fan, I'm not sure I like it as a comic book adaptation. Hugh Jackman is a capable albeit less bad ass and less gruff Wolverine, and Patrick Stewart & Ian McKellan are well cast and well matched as Professor X & Magneto, but the film is too tightly focused on the overly popular Wolverine character to give enough space for character development for the other X-Men. James Marsden is already too young to be an effective Cyclops but it's even harder to gage his acting ability when he has so little to say and do. Halle Berry and Famke Janssen make the most of their roles as Storm & Jean Grey, respectively. Tyler Mane is an imposing Saber Tooth and Rebecca R-Stamos is hard to ignore as the blue shape shifter Mystique. Ray Park (Darth Maul of 'Phantom Menace'), is just annoying as Toad.The special effects are bright and colorful, but there isn't enough action to go along with it. The X-Men are also made down right pathetic during their fight with the obnoxious Toad character. That is, when Storm isn't blowing stuff at him and zapping him with lightning.All in all, I preferred the animated series Fox had back in 1992. The sequel is an improvement of sorts.",Null,1,2,22 April 2004
Spider-Man 3," Topher Grace as Venom? What were they thinking?
","Plot in a nutshell: picking up where #2 left off - or maybe a year or so after #2 - it almost looks like Peter Parker's life has turned around for the better. He's excelling in his studies despite being hit with spitballs by lesser intellects (spitballs? come on Sam, even first graders don't do that anymore!), he has the love of his life, Mary-Jane Watson by his side, MJ just got the lead role in a Broadway musical, he's thinking of popping the question to her, and New York is loving his alter ego, Spider-Man. After the first showing of MJ's play, they enjoy a moment in a big web, staring at the moon, being romantic and affectionate towards each other, so for our hero, life is finally good.But then the real world brings Pete and MJ's fantasy world crashing down around them. Old friend Harry Osborne is still out to avenge his father, Norman's death, as Norman died as Green Goblin against Spidey - derailed only by a brief memory loss - MJ gets fired from her play due to bad critical response over her singing ability or lack thereof, Peter is so high on the love he's getting from the NY populace that he's not being quite as sensitive to her as he should while she's not giving him the grounding he needs, and Gwen Stacy, a cute classmate of Peter's, seems to have her eye on him. To make things worse, Peter learns that a villain named Flint Marko, now the mutated Sandman, was the real killer of Uncle Ben ala Joker killing Batman's parents in the 1989 Batman film - though Sandman reveals it was an accident - and Peter's spot at the Daily Bugle is now being threatened by a smarmy rival photographer named Eddie Brock Jr. Then Pete's Spider-Man suit gets slimed with black goo that turns out to be an alien symbiont, that augments his powers as well as his aggression. When Peter finally realizes what the black symbiont is doing to him and what it will cost him, he rids himself of it in a church, using the noise of the ringing bell to knock it off - only to have it fall on Brock, who came to the church to pray for Peter's death by God's hand after Peter got him fired for submitting photo-shopped pictures of Spider-Man doing evil. This results in the creation of Venom, who allies himself with Sandman to kill Spider-Man. Who will survive? While it stands head and shoulders above last year's barely broke even super-turkey 'Superman Returns', a super-heroic dud if there ever was one, Spider-Man 3 suffers from the same problems that plagued last year's runaway swashbuckler hit sequel 'Pirates of the Caribbean 2: Dead Man's Chest' in that it over-stuffs itself and loses some of the idiosyncrasies that made the first go around so appealing, and also works against its themes of hubris and forgiveness. The actors do their best, but the material isn't up to par. Maguire appears to be having fun during his 'dark' montage (the walk down the streets while pointing and pelvic thrusting at women who look at him with disgust obviously meant as a dark flip-side to the lighthearted 'Raindrops' montage of #2), but his fling with his dark side really should have been handled more seriously. Dunst, not the greatest actress by any means, gives her all but the film isn't always complimentary towards her. Franco perhaps fairs better as Harry, the friend haunted by old demons and a father's specter that he cannot shake.Sporting what must be the worst bleach job in cinema history, natural red head Bryce Dalla Howard, almost unrecognizable with ice cream blonde hair, makes the most of the underwritten Gwen Stacy, here given a connection to Eddie Brock that never existed in either the mainstream or Ultimate Marvel universes. But Gwen, the ill-fated lover who was brutally murdered by the Green Goblin back in the 1970s, is little more than a MacGuffin, a plot device to annoy Peter and MJ.Villains... oh there are too many. Thomas Haden Church makes the most of his Sandman character, a complex but fairly low ranking villain who gets the spotlight mostly because director Sam Raimi seems to like him, but he only appears sporadically, and the thing with him as Uncle Ben's accidental killer not only feels forced but undermines the guilt factor that drives Spider-Man.Rail thin Topher Grace is hopelessly miscast as Brock/Venom, playing him as basically a mean, jerky version of his 70s Show character, and he's clearly in over his head because he has neither the physicality or intense range to pull it off. Grace no doubt hoped Venom would do for him what Batman did for Michael Keaton, but it just doesn't work. This is what happens when directors are forced to use characters they clearly don't like and then create watered down hybrids of them from their mainstream/Ultimate universe counterparts. Well, the action sequences are still superb, and the film does have an obviously deep love for its title character. It's biggest crime is that it over-reaches its grasp, as seems to be the fate of so many comic book film franchises. So it's entirely great, but it's not entirely bad either.",6,0,1,11 May 2007
The Terminator," The kind of film that aspiring screen writers of today wish they had thought of first...
","When James Cameron finally got the Terminator made, the studio refused to advertise it as a 'science fiction film', which puzzled Cameron. When he asked why, they said it didn't count as science fiction because it wasn't set in outer space like Star Trek and Star Wars. Jim shot back that it was science fiction because it dealt with time travel and cyborgs. This was significant for science fiction film making because, as much fun as those out of this world galaxies are, science fiction can still be compelling when set on Earth. The film also made a star out of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Well, technically 'Conan the Barbarian' did that, but 'Terminator' helped him break out of costume films and get into the shoot 'em ups.Arnold plays the title character, a robot in human skin sent back to 1984 LA to kill Sarah Connor (a 28 year old Linda Hamilton with her hair dyed dirty blond), a good natured but lonely, somewhat scatter-brained, hapless waitress who has no idea of just how important she really is: she's the mother of John Connor, the man who will save what's left of the human race in the year 2019 when the machines have almost succeeded in taking over the world. Sarah's only hope is Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn, who later starred in James Cameron's 'Aliens' and 'The Abyss'), a soldier sent back from the future to protect her from the Terminator. Chaos and mayhem ensue, along with a high body count and the unexpected love story between Sarah & Kyle, the latter who turns out to be John Connor's father. Oh the irony of Kyle's response to Sarah's question about John's father: 'John never said much about him... I know he dies before the war.'Yes, some of the special effects are dated (namely the puppet head used for the scene where the Terminator cuts out its damaged eye and a few of the stop motion effects) and it's set in its era and it kind of runs out of steam towards the end, but the rest of the film is great: it's dark, it's eerie, it's seamy, it's atmospheric, it's violent, it's got pretty much everything. Arnold dominates pretty much every scene he's in. Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton are sympathetic protagonists.Personally, I like this one better than the sequels, possibly because there's no Edward Furlong in it. The big difference between the films is that the original was more of a thriller, an extended chase scene, whereas the sequels were more about style and special effects and blow you away action sequences. But it's all good in the end. This is also a great examination of what could happen should technology get out of hand, ala 'Blade Runner'.The DVD has two options of sound effects, the old mono system and a newer, more sophisticated one. I highly advise you not to listen to the newer sound system because it makes everything in the film sound really fake. The DVD also has deleted scenes, mostly notably a scene where Reese suffers an emotional break down over being displaced in time, an angle that never surfaced in the film but would have been very interesting to bring up.'I'll be back.'",10,5,6,7 April 2004
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Entertaining if Idiosyncratic
","PLOT IN A NUTSHELL: Long ago, there was a war between humans and elves, which led to the creation of an unstoppable force called the Golden Army, which annihilated the humans, but the elf king decided that he went too far and made a peace treaty with the humans, much to the anger of his son, Prince Nuada (Luke Goss), who saw the humans as beneath his kind. Centuries later, the Prince has decided to break the treaty and take the crown pieces necessary for controlling the Golden Army. Humanity's only hope is Hellboy (Ron Perlman), who has recently outed himself to the world, and with him the Burea of Paranormal Research & Defense, which includes his flame throwing girlfriend Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) and his amphibian fellow Abe Sapien (Doug Jones), who falls in love with Princess Nuala (Anna Walton), who has chosen to oppose her brother. Who will survive? If you've read the other reviews, you probably know.Entertaining sequel to the first Hellboy from 2004. Del Toro shows a great visual flair that is hard to match, and the action sequences are highly engaging, though it's a shame his film had to come out in a season over-saturated by visual effects everywhere.I do have some beefs with the film though. In some ways, the film seems to have reset Hellboy as the immature adolescent in a man-demon body that he was in the first film, and perhaps taken him even further back than that. I never expected them to become friends, but after saving Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor) at the end of the first film and being assisted by him in slaying Kronen, followed by the cigar bonding, I expected that they would at least try to be more civil with each other in the sequel. Here though, Hellboy seems to be going out of his way to make Manning miserable while a strangely squeamish Manning is so desperate for cooperation that he's reduced to bribing Hellboy with cigars in hopes of getting him to behave. As funny as it is on the surface, Hellboy shooting at pictures of Manning & posting them around the bureau was a bit cruel. Hellboy blithely exposing himself to the world simply because he wants to be respected as a heroic celebrity regardless of what the consequences might be for his non-human friends, Abe & Liz, also goes a bit too far in the selfishness department. This of course comes back to bite him in the ass in true careful-what-you-wish-for fashion, when, after saving a baby AND slaying a forest god, the people react with fear & hatred towards our red hulking hero instead of being grateful in a moment that could have been ripped from the X-Men (the alienated hero as symbol of prejudice victim did not really appear in the original Hellboy comics BTW). Could Hellboy have really been THAT naive to think the human race would embrace him? Liz Sherman perhaps says it best after the incident - 'Does everybody have to like you?' Then there's Hellboy's romance with Liz (which does not exist in the comics). Much as I like Selma Blair in the Liz role, after Spider-Man 3 it was kind of unpleasant to jump back into yet another 'super couple' with relationship issues. And at times Hellboy comes off as a real prick towards her, and not a lovable prick either despite Ron Perlman's best efforts.Another problem is in the romantic subplot between Abe Sapien & Princess Nuala. The problem? The problem is the subplot is not given enough screen time to be properly developed, so it feels rushed & unconvincing, even though the few times that they are together Abe & Nuala do generate a certain sweetness, due in large part perhaps because Anna Walton fills the character with an angelic sincerity that makes her more than just a goth chick.In case you're wondering why John Myers isn't in this one, it's because his actor, Rupert Evans wasn't available, so he was written out.",7,1,5,28 July 2008
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The Jedi Return
","Contains Spoilers After rescuing Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt, Luke returns to Dagobah to finish his training, but Yoda is dying. Just before he expires, Yoda tells Luke that he's close to being a full fledged Jedi and that to complete his training he must thwart Darth Vader once and for all and that there's another Skywalker. There's just one problem, which Yoda finally confirms: Vader IS Luke's father, Anakin Skywalker. It is here that the ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi comes clean about Luke's dad, that O himself was very impressed with Anakin when he met him and arrogantly believed that he could train Anakin as well as Yoda. Big mistake. Luke doesn't want to fight Vader knowing that he's his father, but Obi-Wan tells him that saving Vader's soul is a lost cause: 'He's more machine now, than man. Twisted and evil.' Then another bombshell is dropped - Leia is Luke's sister.We later catch up with the Rebel Alliance and their plans to destroy the new Death Star. Han will lead a group of soldiers on Endor into the shield generator complex that keeps the shield protecting the new Death Star working and blow it up while Lando, back in the driver's seat of the Millenium Falcon, leads the attack on the Death Star itself. After some forest hijinx and making an alliance with the local alien race of Ewoks - cute little teddy bear men and women - Luke tells Leia that they're twins and then he lets himself get captured so he can face Vader and the Emperor. Luke appeals to Vader to repent his sins and resists the temptations of the Emperor, but Vader insists that the Dark Side is the right side and the Emperor continues to act all disturbingly feminine towards Luke while the battle rages on outside and on Endor. Luke is eventually forced to fight Vader in order to save him while the Emperor goads him to give into the hate within him. Finally, Vader pisses Luke off by suggesting that Leia may fall prey to the Dark Side and Luke kicks his ass. After teetering on the brink for a moment, Luke throws down his light saber and says that if the Emperor wants him, he'll have to kill him. The Emperor tries to Kentucky fry Luke and Luke calls out to Vader for help. After watching his boy get fried for a few seconds, Vader attacks the Emperor, hefts him up and throws him to his death. Luke tries to save Vader while he's still alive and even unmasks him. Vader repents, tells Luke he's sorry and expires. Luke then escapes the Death Star before Lando and the gang blow it to smithereens. Han was helped in its destruction by the Ewoks.Luke burns Vader's body, joins the celebration over the destruction of the Empire and sees the ghost of his father Anakin Skywalker with the ghosts of Yoda & Obi-Wan. And they all live happily ever after.Yeah it's a little too cute in some spots, but at the end of the day, it's not a bad film. Maybe not the best way to wrap up a trilogy, but certainly not as bad as so many people would make it out to be or as bad as the prequels that were relased in 1999 and 2002 (and projectedly 2005).
The film is more about Luke, which makes sense since he's the main character. Mark Hamill does a pretty good job, all in all. Harrison Ford has little to do here as Han Solo. Ford really lit up the screen whenever he was on hand in the first two films, but here he keeps mostly to the background, which is a bit of a shame given the flair we were accustomed to him giving Han. This is partially due to the fact that the film is mostly about Luke, and the fact that Ford was making the transition from smart ass matinee idol to quiet leading man, and probably also he was simply getting tired of playing the same smart ass over and over again. Ford's not bad, but he does feel under used. Carrie Fisher has more to do as Leia, but when you look at her eyes and her smeared eye liner, she looks like she's lost, like she's off on her own, like she almost doesn't know where she is. Known for having abused drugs in the past, this was probably the point where poor Carrie was starting to lose it. Still, Fisher and Ford make the most of their roles and screen time, as does Billy Dee Williams as Lando. James Earl Jones still has the intimidating boom in his voice as Vader, but it's a shame that it wasn't David Prowse we saw when Vader was unmasked. I always thought Ian McDiarmid was a bit feminine as the Emperor, more annoying than scary. Alec Guinness still has that poetic charm as Obi-Wan.Special effects are still a highlight of the film, with plenty of battles and the light saber duel to entertain.",10,0,0,9 April 2004
MASH," Painless is Suicide
","Director Robert Altman's mad cap adaptation of the late Richard Hornberger (AKA: Richard Hooker) novel about odd-ball army doctors who work hard, play hard, drink hard, love/lust hard, and make you all laugh while trying to get through the Korean War as best they can. Starring Donald Sutherland as Hawkeye Pierce, Elliot Gould as Trapper John, Tom Skerritt as Duke Forrest, Sally Kellerman as Hot Lips Houlihan, Roger Bowen as Henry Blake, Gary Burghoff as Radar O'Reilly (the only lead to reprise his role for the TV series that followed), and Robert Duvall as Frank Burns.Marred only by over-length, a slow pace and an anti-climatic football game finale. Highlights include Trapper John getting a party for the much coveted chief surgeon post, Hot Lips orgasm with Frank Burns being broadcast all over the camp, Hot Lips being 'exposed' by Hawkeye & the gang, and the whole bit with Hawkeye & Trapper John being interrupted for some surgery in Japan when they'd rather be playing golf. The TV series that followed, while fun in its own way, wasn't nearly as blackly comical as the original film, though it won countless awards for its 'humanitarianism'. Where Donald Sutherland combined a laid back virility with light-hearted madness in the Hawkeye Pierce role, Alan Alda came off as smug, too self-righteous and off putting. For some inexplicable reason, Duke Forrest was never included on the TV version of MASH (which was written up as M*A*S*H) even though he had been in the original book.",Null,1,3,4 October 2004
The Doors," Crap
","Passionate but overlong and incompetent biographical picture about Jim Morrison, the infamous lead singer of the Doors, played with fire powered gusto by Val Kilmer. Film stumbles and bumbles along the pinpoints of Morrison's young adult life (he died at 27) from meeting his girlfriend played by Meg Ryan, to quitting film school, to forming the Doors with his friend, to playing in concerts and the infamous Ed Sullivan show incident, and of course, Jim's various outbursts of uncontrolled frenzy, Jim's unfaithfulness to his girlfriend, before showing his death in France.
As I said, Val is great as Jim and is also an uncanny look a like and also did his own singing (the real band said they couldn't tell Val's singing apart from Jim's) but the film is just an excessive pile of crap that doesn't really tell you anything about Jim Morrison except that he was a drug addict and a self-destructive psychopathic freak. Still, the real tragedy is that such an obviously gifted and talented man wasted his life so badly. I guess the old saying goes that the light that burns twice is bright burns half as long.",Null,1,3,29 March 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Why does Obi-Wan look like Jesus Christ?
","SPOILER! Picking up 10 years later, Anakin Skywalker is no longer an adorable if stoic little kid but now a tall, gangly, jerky young man (Hayden Christensen) with a tendency to whine and bitch about stuff for no apparent reason (takes things way too personally he does). Well, him and his master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) are assigned to protect former queen turned senator Padme (Natalie Portman) after ten years apart from an assassin. This job eventually leads to Obi-Wan being separated from Anakin while he investigates the assassin who happens to be involved with a cloning conspiracy and this later leads him to a renegade Jedi master played by Christopher Lee. Guess what? Anakin still has the hots for Padme and whilst Obi-Wan is away Anakin would like nothing better than to strip her naked and get her in the sack. The future Darth Vader also has a nightmare about his mom's death back on Tatioone and he FINALLY goes to rescue her but by the time he gets there she's already dead so he goes and kills the cannibal Sand People who killed her. This is one of those films that leaves you wondering 'How did this EVER get green lit?' The answer is that it got green lit because of George Lucas's success with the original trilogy and the fact that he backed the film up with his own money and what not. This leads to another question: 'How could anyone have thought that this was a good script?' The answer is no one, but they signed on to it anyway because they all knew they'd get paychecks and they knew people would come out in droves to see it and make it a hit regardless of whether it's good or not. I remember watching 'Phantom Menace' and coming away feeling like 'What happened? HOW could this have happened?'How many things are wrong with this film? Well, I think we all agree that the title sucks so I won't dwell on that for too long. One of the big things working against this movie is the fact that the character relationships, which should be the meat of the film, are never fully defined and/or explored (a similar problem afflicted 2003's 'Daredevil'). George Lucas keeps TELLING us a bunch of things in interviews, but he doesn't depict them particularly well. He TOLD us that Anakin and Obi-Wan were good friends and he TOLD us that Anakin and Padme fall in love, but the manner in which he plays it out is very forced, ersatz and unbelievable. At this point, Anakin's relationship with Obi-Wan is starting to deteriorate; this is a good thing, but it makes very little sense as depicted because the relationship between Anakin and Obi-Wan, which should have been the main focus of 'Menace', was never explored or established in PM, thanks to the continuity error of Liam Neeson's Qui-Gon Jinn character. Ultimately what we're left with is the impression that these two never liked each other much; the only hint of friendship we get is when Obi-Wan tries to comfort Anakin about his nightmares of his mother's death. Which leads to one of the biggest problems with the film - Anakin's mother. It was hard enough to believe that Anakin actually LEFT his mom in PM, but it's even harder to believe that ten years have passed and Anakin never bothered to go back and rescue her from Tatioone. Seeing as how the Jedi Knights are supposed to be great heroes and humanitarians, it's hard to believe that the Jedi - least of all Obi-Wan Kenobi - would not allow Anakin to go back for his mom, especially when you consider how much easier it would have made training him. Or the fact that Padme was rich from being an 'elected queen' (I can't stand that crap) and could very easily have paid the money to free the Skywalker mother. And when he's too late to save her, Anakin goes on a killing spree against the Sand People; okay, they beat his mom to a pulp, I admit that will p*** a guy off, but the circumstances surrounding it simply make no sense, dramatically or logistically.Don't forget the poorly illustrated relationship between Anakin and the future Emperor either (Ian McDiarmid, now playing the young version of his villain from 'Return of the Jedi'). The much hyped love story is also unpleasant, despite a nicely done love theme by John Williams. The majority of it is Anakin leering at Padme like some kind of lusty, sex starved stalker who can't wait to tear all her clothes off and rape the hell out of her and she clearly doesn't like it. Then again, I guess it's hard NOT to leer at a girl like Natalie Portman when everything she wears is either strapless, backless, or gutless. For someone who's a proponent of anti-sleaze in films, Natalie goes out on quite a limb here, even donning black leather (it's like porn for Star Wars fans). The age difference is also an annoying little factor, thus spawning the question of what the older and considerably more mature Padme sees in the future Darth Vader. Bad boy nothing, he continually goes flying off the handle for no apparent reason, even by growing pains standards, and then he goes on the aforementioned killing spree and instead of horrifying her and revolting her it only seems to get her to fall in love with him. I'm all for tragic, doomed love affairs but the truth is that there's no real reason for these two to get together except that Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia need a mom. And what was up with the line about hating sand?Politics are not particularly well done either. Having Jar Jar Binks back and having him play a key role in the rise of the Empire - convincing the senate to okay the creation of the Clone Army thus starting the Clone Wars mentioned in the original film - is quite insulting. The acting is a mixed bag at best. Ewan McGregor manages to make the young Obi-Wan (who now looks like Jesus Christ) a somewhat poetic and likable figure, whilst Samuel L. Jackson is a capable Jedi and Christopher Lee does his usual larger than life villain. Natalie Portman, as cute as she may be, can't make heads nor tails of her Padme, always talking in a flat, high pitched voice that makes her sound too much like a girl and not enough like a woman. Hayden Christensen tries hard but he's either too stiff as Anakin or he's just annoying and, ultimately, he comes off as a sadistic creep. It's not like Al Pacino in the Godfather, where his character was a smart, honorable, well intentioned man who was blind-sided by his own ruthless ambitions. Then again, Christensen doesn't really have much to work with, does he?There are a few neat sequences - the hover chase after Jango Fett, the gladiator arena pitting Obi-Wan, Anakin and Padme against a bunch of beasts, the sight of a bunch of Jedi lighting up their light sabers (don't miss the Jedi who looks like a cone head and the green Jedi with the dread locks), and of course, Yoda's fight with Christopher Lee (but I could have done without the Bruce Lee crowing). However, I have a hard time believing that all these Force powered Jedi could get killed by mindless robots.Kind of makes you wonder how often George Lucas ventures out from his ranch.",1,1,4,2 June 2004

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," 'All you have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to you.'
","The beginning of the great Lord of the Rings epic. The ring of power is discovered in the hands of hobbit man Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm), the title character and hero of JRR Tolkien's 'The Hobbit', who then passes it to his nephew Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood). The wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) pulls a few strings to bring together the various races of Middle Earth to join in a quest to destroy the ring. Along the way many will fall and many will live, but the fate of the world all rests in the hands of Frodo and his companion Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin). Joining them is a burned out 'ranger' who is actually the heir to one of Middle Earth's finest kingdoms, Aragorn, AKA: Strider (Viggo Mortensen), Boromir (Sean Bean) the troubled son of the Steward of Gondor, elf archer Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Ghimli the dwarf (John Rhys Davies!) and two other hobbits, Merry and Pippin (Billby Boyd and Dominic Monaghan, respectively). And don't forget Gandalf the Grey.A great long road movie of a fantasy that could easily have been made boring is kept alive by the direction of Peter Jackson, who didn't stay nearly as close to the books as the inept Chris Columbus tried to stick to JK Rowling's Harry Potter books but somehow delivered a far better film, capturing the spirit and humanity of Tolkien's work. Wood is sometimes annoying and sometimes endearing as Frodo, so I give him a 6 out of 10. Astin, Monaghan and Boyd are all fine as the other Hobbits. McKellan and Mortensen shine as Gandalf and Aragorn, with Bean working hard to make you sympathize with Boromir even though may not like him. Davies makes the most of his Ghimli role while Bloom has little to do except stand around and look pretty. Hugo Weaving really stands tall as Lord Elrond of Rivendell (far more engaging than his Matrix work). As for Liv Tyler as Arwen, well, to me Liv will always be Bruce Willis's slutty daughter from 'Armageddon'. Liv's work here is fine, but I do feel that they were kind of using her face and name as a battering ram to propel the advertising campaign. She isn't bad but it's a shame that she overshadows the work of Miranda Otto as Eowyn in 'TT' and 'ROTK' and that Christopher Lee, who played the loathsome Saruman with such quiet malice, was cut from the 3rd film whilst Liv was kept in.Great sets, great costumes, great props, great locations, and great music by Howard Shore.

28 Weeks Later," Weak sequel to art house horror hit '28 Days Later'
","Picking up the title number of weeks after the original '28 Days Later' left off (after an opening flashback set within the time frame events of the first film), the infected appear to be finished and the army is now moving people back into London, or at least the cleanest area while salvage is still underway. But in the tradition of stupid people doing stupid things, two kids sneak out into not safe zone to get whatever material possessions they want from their old house, where they find their mother, whom they believed was dead. Their mother, with her two different colored eyes (she played Mel Gibson's doomed wife in 'Braveheart') is infected by the rage virus that ravaged the first film, yet she appears to be immune to it, though she is still a carrier. Naturally, an army doctor (Rose Byrne) wants to examine her and see if they can find a way to cure her and then turn that cure around the world, but her superior does not agree. Before either can do anything, the kids' dad/husband of the woman (shark faced Robert Carlyle) visits his wife/mother of his kids to beg her forgiveness; he kisses her passionately, her saliva transfers the virus to him, he goes mad, kills her, then he starts the whole epidemic all over again. To make a long story short, lots of people die (including the army doctor and a heroic US Delta Commando), London gets firebombed, the two kids seem to get away, the infected dad is killed by his own daughter, and while the two kids are air-lifted out by a US chopper pilot, the film ends with his chopper empty in Paris, where the infected run wild.Like so many sequels, '28 Weeks Later' tries to up the ante and shoot for a larger scale. In short order, WEEKS tries to be an epic film for its genre, whereas the original '28 Days Later' was a smaller, more compact road movie. 'Weeks' has high ambitions but it never lives up to them, the film is too long and does not really go anywhere. A true blue disappointment.I imagine the inevitable sequels will be '28 Months Later' (which would be about 2 and 1/2 years) and '28 Years Later'.",4,1,3,11 October 2007

The hapless Kidman is helped by a rugged Zellwegger and struggles to carry on in spite of the hardships and bullying of a greedy man (Ray Winstone, slumming it badly) who wants her lands and just happens to be the sheriff. Well, him and his thugs are later destroyed by Jude Law, but does Law live happily ever after? After the first ten minutes you probably won't care. Law gives his best but the film is just too bloated and sluggish to be engaging (and Law has noticeable trouble holding a Southern accent).

Bateman is also harboring a dark secret: he likes to kill people, regardless of whether they're homeless men, fellow yuppies or the slutty women he sleeps with. Why? No particular reason it seems, except perhaps that all the years of maintaining an outer image of success and perfection have taken their toll on his mental health and he finds that killing people is the only way out for him. But when he murders fellow yuppie Jared Leto and starts getting investigated by an underused Willem Dafoe's detective, things get sticky. Based on a book that I haven't read and probably wouldn't want to read.Bale gives a spirited performance as the lunatic yuppie out on a killing spree (probably one of the reasons he got tapped for the part of Batman by Christopher Nolan), but the film doesn't seem to know where its going and offers no real closure.

North by Northwest," Worth it just to see the the crop duster chase
","I can't quite understand how anyone can dislike Alfred Hitchcock's films. Personally, he's one of the few old school talents I find interesting and watchable, even if his work is dated and set in its era (the era when most sets were hopelessly phony). I guess you have to appreciate his themes - dysfunctional relationships between a man and his mother, flawed by essentially innocent men caught up in a web of intrigue, beautiful blonds, comments of authority figures, black humor, etc - to really appreciate Hitchcock.Interestingly, James Stewart was Hitchcock's original choice for the role of Roger Thornhill, the hapless ad man who is mistaken for a spy who doesn't even exist to begin with and is chased half way across the country by villains and authorities for a murder he didn't commit. For one reason or another, Stewart was unavailable and the part went to Cary Grant instead. Grant seems better suited to the character and the situation than Stewart would have been, but I can easily picture Stewart being chased in the cornfield by the crop duster.Like all Hitchcock films, there are hundreds of things that aren't realistic though set in the real world and lots of highly improbable stuff going on everywhere, but if you give it a chance you'll enjoy it and won't care. Don't miss Eva Marie Saint having to dub over a then lewd line about love, a full stomach and sex. The use of a crop duster may not be the most practical way to kill a man, but it's a great visual representation of the great Hitchcockian examination of 'nowhere to run, nowhere to hide'. The music and clinging to Mount Rushmore is also memorable. Did I mention the innuendo?",Null,98,145,4 April 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Another classic series is tarnished...
","T3's plot is basically T2's without Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, Edward Furlong as John Connor and in place of Robert Patrick's T-1000 is the new female Terminator played by the beautiful blond, blue eyed Kristanna Loken.John Connor is now a young adult played by Nick Stahl (the little kid from 'Man Without A Face' all grown up and now resembling a young Paul Newman). Sarah's dead and John's a drifter who just wanders around because he's still afraid that a Terminator might come knocking on his door if he sets down roots anywhere. That's when the lady Terminator shows up stark naked, kills a woman and steals her clothes and goes around killing a few of John's future 2nd in commands and then tries to kill both John and his future wife Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), who was a mild associate of his when they were kids. That's when Arnold's Terminator shows up to save the day. Did I mention Kate's dad is a general continuing the Skynet project? Well, basically the whole 'you can change your destiny' moral from T2 is smashed into the ground in favor of the 'destiny is set' moral because Skynet takes over and destroys the world anyway, thanks to the Internet. But John & Kate survive to lead the resistance.Now this isn't a bad film necessarily, but then again, neither was 'Indiana Jones & The Temple of Doom'. Like that 2nd Indiana Jones feature, T3 doesn't even come close to being the classic that the first two entries were. Arnold's still fun to watch as the Terminator, Nick Stahl is a more sympathetic John Connor than Edward Furlong could ever have hoped to be, Claire Danes is alright but no Linda Hamilton and Kristanna Loken does the stoic female Terminator bit as well as any other actress can, but ultimately the film is hollow, cheesy and pointless. Despite Loken's efforts, she's never as creepy as the T-1000, and not just because she's a beautiful woman who leads the men in the audience to fantasizing about her (and I've seen some pretty creepy women in cinema in my time). The action scenes are executed competently enough but they lack the slickness of T2 and the raw power of the T1.Ultimately, the only reasons for this film being made were to work the Internet into the Terminator mythology and to get a tall, beautiful blond woman Terminator naked to satisfy all the fan boys who wanted a naked Terminator woman. Well, those fantasies are fulfilled early in the film, when Kristanna makes the classic entrance and starts walking around completely naked, but most annoyingly her magnificent 5'11' figure is kept in the shadows for the most, which isn't fair considering that the original film and this film throw Arnold's butt right in our faces, something no one ever wanted to see except maybe his own wife, Maria. You'll have to look closely to see her derriere just before she kills her first victim. And like all women, Kristanna looks better with her hair down.You know what a more interesting film would have been? Setting the film in the actual future and focusing on the beginning of the Terminators then. Arnold could have played a soldier who is killed by the machines and later his body is used as a model for the other Terminators to follow in as the mold.",Null,0,0,7 April 2004

As was usually the case with Kubrick's films, 'The Shining' values style over substance. Even though the film is genuinely very scary, it lacks any real, concrete emotional weight.

Wanted," Action trash, and not particularly good action trash at that
","PLOT (or lack there of): a jerky, mean spirited loser whom we are meant to embrace as an everyman protagonist (McAvoy) is plucked out of his unhappy, depressing life (which includes a crappy job with an annoying boss, a bitchy, unfaithful girlfriend who cheats on him - with his knowledge - with his douche bag 'best friend') by the mysterious Freeman, who reveals that McAvoy's character is the son of a highly skilled, practically superhuman assassin, for his fraternity of superhuman assassins who base their kills on mystical messages of sorts from a loom, trained (make that repeatedly beaten up) by Jolie. But there is more to it than meets the eye. Or not.I admit to having not read the original comic book that this was based off of, so I can only judge the film for what it is - action trash, and not particularly good action trash at that. Besides the over the top absurdity, the soulless clichés, the plot holes and ridiculous 'action' scenes, there's not one single likable character in all this mess. As I stated before, the main character played James McAvoy is a mean spirited jerk from the get go, and by the end of the film he is no better personality wise than he was before. Yes, it is established that he's had a crappy life, but that alone does not redeem his inherently unsympathetic behavior throughout the film. Even anti-heroes need to be vaguely likable in some way, and McAvoy's Wesley simply fails at that. Angelina Jolie sleepwalks through her role as the sexy assassin who takes McAvoy under her wing, and both she and Morgan Freeman deserve better than this. How Freeman even allowed himself to get involved with this nonsense is a mystery (good thing he was also in 'The Dark Knight' around the same time).To call the film style over substance would be an insult since the 'style' is so poor it doesn't begin to hide the lack of substance.

Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Cool for the most part
","Picking up ten years later, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is now an unstable psychopath committed to a mental institution and her son John (Edward Furlong) is a talented but snotty, effeminate little punk/thug brat who lives with an obnoxious foster couple. What they don't know is that the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) is sent back in time to kill Johnny before he can lead the resistance, and he is followed by the Arnold Terminator we all know and love. The Arnold Terminator has his work cut out for him because the T-1000 is a prototype model made out of 'liquid metal', which allows him to turn into 'solid metal shapes' (knives and stabbing weapons), blend into his environment and even take on the shape of an object of 'equal size', but he can't do bombs on account of their 'complex moving parts'. Well, they bust Sarah out of the mental institution and head for the border to get Sarah her guns and plot to destroy Sky-Net in the past before it can destroy the world, and in between the chaos and mayhem, little John teaches his new big buddy Terminator - the closest thing he's ever had to a father - how to be more human, staring with making him vow that he won't kill anyone (he was programmed by the older John in the future to obey the young John in the past; and it's also about the value of life).Stunning special effects, slick action sequences, and a chilling performance by Linda Hamilton highlight this mostly superb action science fiction entry. Arnold is also in great form as the Terminator and Robert Patrick is effectively creepy as the thinner but more advanced T-1000 (it's a shame that he didn't go on to better things after this). The film is marred only by over length and an obnoxious performance by Edward Furlong as John Connor. He simply never engages your sympathy, mostly because he's such a pale, snotty brat to begin with that you don't care about him even if his life has been rough. It's also kind of sad watching big bad Arnold take orders from the overly effeminate Edward Furlong.My suggestion: turn the mute button on whenever Edward opens his mouth. The rest of the film is too good to get hung up on Ed's unsympathetic performance. Some versions of the film run longer than others; the special edition DVD has lost footage that give the film more depth, including a dream sequence where Sarah is confronted, questioned and ultimately comforted by Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), the ill fated hero of the original film.

Van Helsing," Not as bad as all that but still no classic Spoiler

This Van Helsing is a kind of amnesiac world trotting super-spy/assassin who goes around whacking monstrous creatures that threaten man kind and what not. After a bad run in with Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde, he is sent to dispose of Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) with squeamish monk/gadget man Carl (David Wenham) in tow along with a shapely princess named Anna (Kate Beckinsale). Along the way they encounter the Frankenstein monster and some werewolves, but are these as horrible as the secrets of Van Helsing's missing past?Not exactly 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' but not as bad as all the critics would have you believe. There are some weaknesses in story structure and some over done stunts that could have used more restraint and logic (it actually feels LESS professional than Stephen Sommers more light-hearted 'Mummy' films). Jackman plays his part well enough, despite hitting a few sour notes. David Wenham is somewhat funny as his cowardly Q sidekick (but how do you go from playing Faramir in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, winning the hand of the fair Miranda Otto/Eowyn to playing Hugh Jackman's wimpy sidekick?). Richard Roxburgh goes all out over the top as Dracula & Kate Beckinsale basically stands around heaving her chest at the audience. Although I'm not a fan of Kate Beckinsale, I found her death at the end of the film rather came out of left field and should have been left on the cutting room floor (unless the idea was to make VH darker than the Mummy films).

Spider-Man," Tobey VS Willem
","Big screen adaptation of the much beloved comic book character finds shy, lonely teen misfit outcast Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) getting bitten by a radioactive spider that gives him super strength, super stamina, the ability to climb walls, a danger sense and even the ability to shoot web out of his wrists (in the original comic book he had to make the webbing himself, though why his body didn't inherit the ability to make the webbing is a mystery). After his uncle is murdered by a criminal he ignored stopping, Parker dedicates himself to being Spider-Man, a high swinging super hero. The only problem is that he still pines for Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and is drifting away from his troubled pal Harry Osborne (James Franco; who originally tested for the lead role). To make things worse, Harry's dad, businessman/inventor Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe) turns himself into an unstable lunatic villain known as the Green Goblin. How long before Spidey and the Goblin clash? Not too long at all it seems...Many have criticized Maguire for being stiff as Peter Parker. Maybe he is and maybe the flatness of his voice is annoying, but in a way that's kind of the idea: Peter Parker is not a bad ass like Wolverine. Peter Parker is a downtrodden underdog who never seems to come out on top. Once he pulls on the Spider-Man mask though he's actually quite engaging. Maguire, however, along with the capable Franco and Dunst, are all easily outshone by Willem Dafoe as the film's villain, despite the stupidity of his costume (the energy in his voice manages to overcome the lack of his unique face hidden behind that goofy mask). Willem steals the movie in a manner similar to how Jack Nicholson stole the show in 1989's 'Batman'. Special effects are wildly uneven though. The guy who plays Parker's boss is also quite funny and dead on in capturing that character's likeness. One of my favorite moments is when Maguire tries to voice activate his wrist webbing.'Think of what we could create... or we could destroy. Maim. Kill.

Batman Begins," 'Swear to *me*!'
","First, a recap - after the success of the 1978 Superman film, Warner Brothers was eager to bring another DC Comic book character to the big screen, so naturally, they turned their eyes to the only other DC character who could rival/match Superman for pop culture icon status, Batman (although Wonder Woman is in third place). For ten long, seemingly fruitless years, Warner Brothers and DC struggled to bring Batman to the big screen in hopes that the Dark Knight could have back-to-back success with his big brother the Man of Steel (at the same time, sadly, Superman's film franchise went into a slow, steady decline), with various writers, directors and actors coming, going, jumping on, jumping off, jumping back on, jumping back off again, etc. But then Tim Burton, then a new visionary talent on the rise, came along with just enough familiarity with Batman and just enough strength of will and vision to make it happen, and with the backing of the success of 'Beetle-Juice', Warners Brothers were just crazy enough to let Tim have a go at it, even if it meant hiring the seemingly less than ideal but in the end very effective Michael Keaton to play the title character. Then in the summer of 1989, with Superman's never ending battle for truth, justice and the American way having died on the big screen, Batman stepped in to fill the void, and a phenomenon of epic proportions so rarely seen before or since was born. Then came 1992's 'Batman Returns', which was also a mega-hit but inspired a backlash from parents who found the film to be too dark and mean-spirited for their kids (parents reportedly had to drag crying children out of the theater that summer). In response to this and speculation that Batman couldn't hold the fort, Burton was politely asked to step aside and his friend Joel Schumacher came on board with a new Batman, Val Kilmer, stepping in for an MIA Keaton, with the flashier, more light-hearted 'Batman Forever', which was also a hit despite taking a great deal of flack over stuff like rubber nipples on the bat suit. But then everything came falling down with 'Batman & Robin', which many complained was too campy while the 2nd film had been too dark, and which featured another new Batman, George Clooney, playing the Dark Knight as a light-hearted scamp (Kilmer at least tried to capture the essence of Batman) in a film that proved to be too much of everything - too garishly bright, too over the top in spectacle, too overly produced and over-exposed it forced the WB to give Batman a time out, leaving Joel Schumacher with a long and bitter battle on his hands as he fought to rebuild his reputation as an actually good director while Clooney went on to bigger, better things.But Warner Brothers wasn't quite done with Batman just yet. After all, he's one of the great iconic comic book characters alongside the X-Men, Spider-Man and of course, big brother Superman. And once again the WB and DC struggled to get the movie Batman back on his feet, but it would require slimming/trimming/toning it down and going back to basics. Once again, writers, directors, and actors came and went in the seven years between now and then, but finally things came together with director Christopher Nolan, writer David S. Goyer and star Christian Bale. But how to make it fresh, appealing, new, not simply a rehash of the previous films but still undeniably Batman? By going back to the beginning, delving into what the earlier films only hinted at or lightly touched upon, so much so to the point that in the beginning it doesn't even feel like a Batman film.The result is the familiar but well told origin story of how Bruce Wayne lost his wealthy and warm-hearted parents to a random mugger, Joe Chill, but still in connection with criminal kingpin Falcone (Tom Wilkinson). Years later the conflicted, spiritually lost adult Bruce (Bale), torn between a genuine desire for justice and his thirsting for revenge, embarks on a journey unto which he confronts his deepest fears, trains and hardens himself to his very limits and then, coming back to Gotham City to become symbolic avenger of injustice, the Batman, aided by loyal man-servant/surrogate father figure Alfred (well played by Michael Caine). Additionally, Batman must fight not only Falcone but the Scarecrow/Dr. Jon Crane (a lightweight Cillian Murphy), and Ra's Ah Guhl (played by Ken Watanabe and Liam Neeson, the latter in a rare villainous/anti-hero role that he plays very well), and he must reclaim his father's company from the unscrupulous Rutger Hauer with help from Morgan Freeman as Luscious Fox, make an alliance with Gary Oldman's Sgt/Lt./eventually Commissioner Jim Gordon, and rescue his foxy/sexy childhood friend turned lawyer brunette Rachael Dawes (Katie Holmes at the beginning of the Tom Cruise fiasco).Batman/Bruce Wayne is well played by Christian Bale. At times reusing his 'American Psycho' performance, Bale hits a few flat notes but on the whole he's the best new Batman anyone could hope for: 6-feet tall, good looking, muscular, and actually possessing good solid acting ability, here's hoping they don't lose him.",9,2,2,26 February 2006

","Ah yes, the infamous Steven Spielberg 'flop' that chronicled the antics, shenanigans and misadventures of crazed Californians following the Pearl Harbor attack. What can I say - it is a noble failure, a well meaning attempt to make fun of both the 1940s films and World War II films in general with their America #1 and contrived romances. Perhaps, if a more comically inclined director like Robert Zemeckis (who coined the story with Bob Gale) or John Landis (who appears as the dirt covered motorcycle corporal) had been at the helm it might have worked. As it is, the film has a brilliant idea but it never quite takes off.It does not have so much a central plot but is more a series of subplots loosely strung together. They are in no particular order - 1) The Japanese sub commanded by the late great Japanese film legend Toshiro 'The Wolf' Mifune, off the coast of California looking for something 'honorable' to destroy, with Christopher Lee by his side as a German general. When the Japanese get stuck interrogating Slim Pickens (the mad bomb riding pilot in 'Dr. Strangelove') in the most unpleasant manner, Mifune grumbles 'This has not been honorable...' 2) Crusty Maj. General Joseph W. Stilwell (Robert Stack, who, in make up/glasses/uniform, actually does bear an uncanny resemblance to the real General Stilwell) tries to keep the people of California calm while trying to put time aside to kick back and watch Dumbo, which brings him to tears.3) A wild, drunken, comically intense/volatile, sloppy man child pilot known as Wild Bill Kelso (John Belushi) flies all over the place looking for enemy fighter pilots to down. These kind of sloppy man children were typical canon of Belushi, and in particular this one is very similar to his Bluto character from 'Animal House' (again, Jake Blues was his best role).4) General Stilwell's aid, Captain Loomis Birkhead (Tim Matheson, basically reprising his Otter character from 'Animal House'), a tall, dark, stereotypically oversexed pretty boy and failed fighter pilot, spends the majority of the film comically pursuing General Stilwell's beautiful young secretary, the nicely round, shapely Donna Stratton (Nancy Allen, in a role far removed from the hooker of 'Dressed to Kill' and the rough and tumble policewoman Anne Lewis in 'Robocop'). The only problem aside from Donna's apprehensions of Loomis, is that she can't get aroused unless she's in a high flying airplane.5) Downtrodden minority and would be Hispanic Zoot Suiter Wally Stephens (Bobby De Cicco) battles the evil, lecherous, egg hating Cpl. Chuck 'Stretch' Sitarski (a much younger Treat Williams) for his one true love Betty Douglas (Dianne Kay).6) Sgt. Frank Tree (Dan Aykroyd) and his not so howling commandos move into Betty Douglas's home, much to the chagrin of her mother Joan (Lorraine Gary), but her dad Ward (Ned Beatty) is more than willing to assist. Among Frank's troops is the late John Candy. Frank is very fond of saying 'If there's one thing I can't stand, it's Americans fighting Americans.' Seriously, if it weren't for Dan Aykroyd's delivery, the line wouldn't work nearly as well. Over the course of the film, Wally and 'Stretch' fight each other for Betty at an inner city dance, which leads to a brawl among marines, sailors, etc (based on the real life 1940s riots between visiting soldiers and local Hispanic Zoot Suitors - proof that when you put white authoritarian soldiers in the same room with minorities you're asking for trouble). Loomis manages to get Donna in an airplane, which transforms her into a walking, 5'6' orgasm, but their airborne tryst is interrupted by Wild Bill Kelso, who mistakes them for the enemy. Frank gets bonked on the head and suffers shell shock, leaving Wally - who's not even an enlisted man - in charge of his team. Toshiro Mifune throws Christopher Lee overboard and orders his men to destroy a beach side amusement park. Chaos, mayhem, and lots of property damage ensues.Some of this is very funny, some of it is just overkill. Perhaps if things like Slim Pickens character and the guys on the ferris wheel with the dummy had been left on the cutting room floor it might have been more fun. But it's not completely uninteresting. There's is a funny opening the strapping blonde skinny dipper from Spielberg's 'Jaws' clinging in a rather phallic manner to the Japanese sub periscope.Nancy Allen and Dianne Kay are great eye candy - and Nancy's airplane orgasm is pretty funny.'What's wrong?! You're not air born yet!''What are you talking about?! Look out the window, of course we're air born!''We are, but... *you're* not.' - Nancy Allen and Tim Matheson.",5,1,4,14 September 2005
28 Days Later...," No relation to the Sandra Bullock movie
","One of those damned pesky incurable virus', playfully nicknamed 'rage', starts running rampant through the world, turning people into mindless, blood thirsty animals. Our quote unquote 'hero' Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in a hospital and wanders around looking for help and eventually runs into the mannish Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley). Mark is later killed when he is suspected of being infected and later Jim and Selena run into a lovable family man named Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). Together they make a trek to find some army guys who might help them, but Frank is gunned down after he becomes infected and later on we find out that most of the soldiers are horny bastards, which puts them and their leader Major Henry West (Christopher Eccleston) at odds with Jim. Well, Jim eventually uses his wits to overcome the evil soldiers and escapes with Selena and Hannah, and they eventually get rescued or at least alluded to getting rescued.It could be argued that this really isn't a zombie film, seeing as how zombies are resurrected corpses and these are once living people who have been turned into killers thanks to the virus. It's pretty fun to watch overall, with lots of dark atmosphere and a moody score, though it runs out of a steam a little bit towards the end. In terms of actual acting, well, the truth is that cold fish Cillian Murphy and the rest of the cast are all easily out-shined and out-acted by Brendan Gleeson as the teddy bearish father Frank. I'm sorry but Brendan Gleeson brought a warmth and humanity to the film that made it a lot more compelling when he was on the screen. Once we lose him though the film becomes a tad boring, but only a tad.",8,1,2,11 August 2004
X-Men: The Last Stand," An entertaining, professional effort by Brett Ratner, but still suffers from the same problem that the first two X-Men films suffered from.
","Plot in a nutshell: Picking up not long after #2, a supposed 'cure' is found for the mutant factor, stirring up tempers on both sides of the mutant and human front, pitting noble mutant savior Charles Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) heroic, S&M leather clad X-Men against anti-hero terrorist with a heart of gold Magneto (Ian McKellan) and his rag tag Brotherhood of mutants once again. The unexpected and uncontrollable factor - the resurrected Jean Grey, AKA: Phoenix (Famke Janssen).I must confess I've had a love/hate relationship with the X-Men films for some time now. While they are generally well made, they make the mistake of placing too much emphasis on Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and not enough emphasis on the other X-Men, which is truly sad because the X-Men is meant to be an ensemble piece, not a showcase for Wolverine with the X-Men as his supporting cast. All three movies made the mistake of working it around how the X-Men figure into Wolverine's life; it should be how Wolverine fits into the X-Men's existence, not the other way around. Cyclops (James Marsden) in particular, such an important character in the X-Men comics, has always been mistreated in the film adaptations, and he is similarly mistreated here, killed off within the first 15 minutes of the film by his one true love, the resurrected Jean Grey, now possessed by her demi-goddess alter ego the Phoenix, who then dispatches a slightly more callous than usual Xavier. Cyclops deserved better. Another character long mistreated by the films would be Rogue, still played by a miscast Anna Pacquin, though she gets considerably less screen time here.Another slight problem is the way it handles new characters. This film finally introduces Beast/Dr. Henry 'Hank' McCoy, well played by Cheers/Frasier veteran Kelsey Grammar, but Angel/Warren Worthington III, played by Ben Foster, is treated as little more than angelic eye candy, as if his only purpose is to look pretty while soaring through the sky with heavenly music. Colossus, again played by the powerfully built Daniel Cudmore, serves little more than as an action figure, though it is great to see him for what few minutes he gets. Which is not to say the film is terrible. While not quite as smooth/slick as the first two films by Bryan Singer, who abandoned the franchise to helm 'Superman Returns' (which doesn't look promising), the much maligned Brett Ratner still churns out a professional summer roller coaster effort. In addition to the eye popping violence, there is a very sweet, tender scene following Xavier's funeral where Bobby 'Iceman' Drake (Shawn Ashmore) takes shy, sensitive, soft spoken Kitty Pryde (here played by the yummy little Ellen Page) ice skating, much to the aggravation of Rogue. There is also a scene both arousing and heart-breaking for Mystique/Raven Darkholme, played by Rebecca Romijn, where a guard tries to shoot Magneto with a cure loaded dart, and she takes it to save him. Mystique then collapses, trembling violently as her scaly blue skin gives way to pale human skin, her slick red hair becomes silky black and her yellow eyes become blue, and she is just laying there completely naked while Magneto stares at her in shock, and then leaves her there, completely naked and helpless, informing her that she no longer one of them, but now one with the enemy. And the look of betrayal on the naked Mystique's face is heart-breaking because it is not only a forced rebirth, but she looks violated, for Mystique now looks like a rape victim, a virgin who lost her innocence against her will, for the mutant power that she had come to take pride in has been stripped away from her, and she is left alone, a weak, frail, fragile naked human, yet she does not belong on either side now, and her sacrifice goes unappreciated by the very man she had come to believe in, who merely shrugs it off and abandons Mystique in her naked vulnerability just when she needs him the most. Thus Mystique's loss of her mutant powers along with her loss of faith in Magneto serves as a symbolic rape or violation, and she is left alone, powerless, helpless and naked, but vengeful. Iceman's tender moment with Kitty, along with the struggle he and Rogue both feel to maintain their relationship, combined with the metaphorical, symbolic rape of Mystique, the innocence of a character like Kitty VS the loss of innocence of Mystique, and Magneto's reaction to the death of Xavier, help to remind the audience of the humanity within the characters as they try to persevere and suffer in the world. Jackman is fine as usual in his neo-Han Solo way, but many of those emotional scenes for him, both regarding Xavier and Jean, should have been played out by Cyclops. Famke Janssen seems to enjoy being the bad Jean, and Ian McKellan is dependable as usual as Magneto, as is Patrick Stewart as Xavier, though Stewart seemed a bit tired. Halle Berry is alright as Storm, finally given an opportunity to whip some ass.",6,1,2,2 June 2006
Hellboy," Faster than a bad Daredevil special effect, more powerful than Spider-Man, able to leap over puny X-Men in a single bound, it's Hellboy!
","Sometime during World War Two, an agency is formed in the US to combat Hitler's occult obsessions within the Nazi organization. This leads a young misfit expert in the occult, Dr. Broom/Bruttenholm, to an accidentally brought over devil child who becomes known as Hellboy. Decades later, Hellboy has grown up into a big, sardonic bad ass (played by Ron Perlman) who works for the government battling other evil monsters with a little help from his surrogate human dad Dr. Broom (played as an old man by John Hurt), his aquatic pal Abe Sapien, and his somewhat Gothic, fire starting lady friend Liz Sherman (Selma Blair). But now dark forces are cranking out a plot that will test Hellboy, his friends, and his new partner, a young, effeminate FBI rookie by name of John Myers (Rupert Evans).I'm not incredibly familiar with the original comic book on which this is based, but I am aware that a number of liberties were taken during the production phase to get this thing made. Well, I found I liked the film even though Nazis aren't all that much fun in terms of villains anymore. There's an unexplainable warmth to this film and a sense of humor that makes it a lot more endearing than those self-righteous X-Men films. The film is helped greatly by the former man-lion of TV's 'Beauty & The Beast', Ron Perlman in the title role, and I can honestly say I'll take Selma Blair over Kirsten Dunst, Jennifer Garner and Natalie Portman ANY DAY. The film is bogged down somewhat by the unnecessary addition of the young, effeminate FBI character, John Myers played by Rupert Evans, who was thrown in primarily to give all the little girls who weren't turned on by Hellboy's virility someone to drool over.",9,0,2,11 August 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The Dwarf... beware the Dwarf...
","Picking up where 'Fellowship of the Ring' left off, Frodo and Sam continue to trudge towards Mordor - with the annoying CGI monstrosity Gollum leading the way and mixing it up with Faramir (Boromir's brother) while Aragorn, Legalos, Ghimli and the newly resurrected Gandalf try to save the people of Rohan from Saruman's monsters and reunite the alliances of men. Chaos and mayhem ensues.Sadly, I didn't like this film as much as I hoped I would. It's a good film overall, but marred by the occasional slow pacing and unnecessary camera mugging. In other words: the dwarf, Ghimli. John Rhys-Davies is a great actor and he was good in 'Fellowship', but he was terrible here (almost as bad as Rupert Grint in 'Harry Potter & The Chamber of Secrets' though not as bad as Jar Jar Binks). He doesn't even feel like he's playing the same character. Ghimli was a capable adventurer in 'Fellowship' but in 'Two Towers' he's suddenly become an idiotic clutz who can't ride a horse without falling off or get down a hill without tripping over his stubby feet. And then there was that 'Toss me! Don't tell the elf!' bit. Oh god that was horrible; it's as if Aragorn was stalling just to make Ghimli say toss me. Peter Jackson wanted comic relief obviously but this was the best he could come up with? Pretty pathetic. I'd rather have a dull, ugly humorless fantasy epic than one who's only source of comic relief is an idiot dwarf. Oddly enough, John Rhys-Davies fairs better at being the voice of Treebeard of the Ents than he does at being Ghimli.Then there's Gollum, the most over-rated CGI abomination in the history of special effects. I can't even go in depth with this one...I did like Miranda Otto as Eowyn though, and of course I prefer Treebeard over Gollum, and I liked Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn and Ian McKellan as Gandalf. The battle of Helm's Deep is spectacular, as is the Ents trashing Saruman's castle. Too bad the dwarf and Gollum had to ruin what should have been a classic.",7,1,2,19 December 2003
The Mist," I liked it until the end
","A small town (the type that supposedly don't exist anymore) is menaced by a supernatural mist loaded with monsters, forcing its residents and few out of towners to haul up inside the local grocery store. Barricading themselves inside, tension runs high and sanity hangs by a thread as they try to wait out the threat long enough for help to arrive, and when a religious zealot (Marcia Gay Harden) starts getting way too mouthy & way too much attention, the few sane people (led by the underrated Thomas Jane) must choose between facing the evil of the MIST or the evil of their deranged fellow shoppers.For the most part, a well executed and well acted adaptation of the Stephen King novella from 1980 that originally appeared in Skeleton Crew, but I must say I was turned off by the ending, which is not the same ending as in the book. Do yourself a favor and just skip to the end credits when the driving begins, that's a much more accurate representation. Still, worth a look.",7,0,1,4 April 2008
Ghostbusters," They came, they saw, they kicked its ass!
","Ousted professors and researchers of the after life Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) go into business for themselves as the Ghostbusters, paranormal investigators and elimantors. 'The franchise rights alone will make us rich beyond our wildest dreams,' says Peter. Initially laughed at and mocked, they get their first customer in the form of the beautiful musician Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver), who's fridge is possessed by monster dogs. Then the G-men capture the green ghost Slimer (originally called 'Onion Head' during production; Slimer later became their mascot of sorts on the cartoon) at a restaurant and before long they become a media sensation with ghosts coming out of the wood work left and right. This leads to them recruiting Winston Zedemore (Ernie Hudson). Then they discover that they're on the edge of the end of the world and Dana's building is the key to the whole thing, but first they must overcome William Atherton's misguided by theoretically well meaning EPA man before they can confront the monstrous Gozer and save the world.
In a role originally intended for the late John Belushi, Bill Murray is a hoot as usual as the dead panned yet sardonic salesman professor Peter Venkman. Writers Aykroyd and Ramis have a little less to do but they're fun to watch as the overly enthusiastic Ray and Spock-like Egon. Sigourney Weaver, Annie Potts and Ernie Hudson do what they can with their roles of Dana, Janine and Winston respectively. You have to admit, it may be a step down from 'Alien' but Weaver manages to imbue Dana with more grace, dignity and warmth than the usual love interest. Rick Moranis has a fun bit as Weaver's nerdy neighbor.Not only is the film funny, the film is also surprisingly creepy in places and boasts some great special effects along memorable music by Elmer Bernstein and the title theme song by Ray Parker Jr. Memorable moments include the library ghost, the eggs popping on the counter, the entire Slimer sequence, the appearance of th Stay-Puft-Marsh-Mellow Man, Harold Ramis attacking William Atherton, William Atherton being burrowed in marsh mellow, and pretty much any time Bill Murray is on screen (like when he yanks the tablecloth out from under the flowers), which is quite often. Don't miss the 'Dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria!' line, or Winston telling the white mayor 'Since I joined these men, I have seen s**t that will turn you WHITE.' Film is dated only by certain 80s wardrobe and the excessive amount of smoking down by the characters.
The sequel is funny and better than most sequels but still not quite on par with the first one. The first cartoon was good but impossible to find. 'Extreme Ghostbusters' you can skip.As a trivia note, Bill Murray's character was voiced by the late Lorenzo Music in the cartoon series. Lorenzo Music was also the voice of Garfield the cat. Bill Murray has now replaced Lorenzo as the voice of Garfield for the new movie.Deleted scenes on the DVD include Janine giving Egon her lucky coin before he goes off to fight Gozer and the Stay Puft Marshmellow Man's hat falling on the populace after he gets blown to bits. Commentary by Harold Ramis and Ivan Reitman is also fun to listen to.",10,1,1,14 April 2004
K-19: The Widowmaker," Widowmaker
","In an attempt to break from his usual sympathetic every man bit, Ford plays a blunt, powerful, hard working Russian Naval officer who is given command of a nuclear powered sub from its well liked, almost fatherly captain played by Liam Neeson. Harrison and Liam clash as only two strong willed alpha males can when they take the sub out for a spin and fight to keep it from blowing up and causing a world wide tragedy.Based on a true story.Ford and Neeson give solid performances to this long, murky, cold, and ultimately detached action drama that proved to be one of 2002's lesser box office endeavors. As stated before, the film suffers from a feeling of disconnection, even as numbers of brave men are sent into the nuclear reactor with improper protection ('They might as well be wearing rain coats!')Could have been better, and it  could have been a lot worse. Rent and judge for yourself. Probably mostly for fans of Ford and Neeson.",Null,45,69,27 April 2004
Back to the Future Part III," 'There's a man who can't hold his liquor.'
","Picking up where #2 left off, Marty is stuck in 1955 again and has to explain to the 1955 Doc why he's back and uses a letter Doc sends him from 1885 to explain what happened. After fixing up the time machine (hidden in a from 1885 cave), they find out that  Doc is murdered in the past by Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen (played by Thomas F. Wilson) 'over a matter of $80 dollars.' So Marty decides to go back and rescue Doc before the murder can occur, but he is bedeviled by a rip in the fuel line - meaning they have to find another way to get the time machine to hit 88 miles per hour - and Doc falling in love with school teacher Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen). Along the way, he gets advice both from Doc and his 1885 ancestor Seamus McFly (also played by Michael J. Fox) that he should really learn to control his temper.Fox and Lloyd are fun to watch as always, and I give my hat off to the studio for hiring Mary Steenburgen as Doc's love interest and not some super model type; it's more fitting of who Doc is. Wilson's Biff Tannen officially became a traditional 'villain' in #2 with him murdering George McFly, and now Wilson plays an even bigger villain in Buford Tannen, whom he makes both funny and menacing.Ironically, Wilson is said to be a very nice man in real life. Leah Thompson makes the most of a thankless dual role as both Lorraine McFly and Marty's great, great grandmother Maggie McFly, and James Tolkan plays his Principal character's soft spoken law man ancestor (killed in a deleted scene by Buford Tannen; 'Remember son... discipline.')It should be noted that originally there were no sequels planned with the first movie; that bit with Doc taking Marty and Jennifer to the future to help their kids was just another gag. But the film was such a hit that the studio couldn't NOT do sequels, so this one and part 2 were filmed back to back, which is becoming more of a craze these days.Although on the surface it's a lighthearted comedy about time travel, it's also about what it means to be a man. The first film defined being a man through violently standing up to your tormentors, while this film and #2 go with the theme that being a man also means you have to reign yourself in when people start annoying you. Marty' willingness to fight back was his strength in the first film but here it is his flaw, as people in both 2015, 1955 and 1885 continually get his goat. The message of self-control is bluntly stated when Doc says to Marty 'You can' t keep going off the handle every time someone calls you a name, that's why you get into that accident in the future!' (referring of course to the car accident mentioned in part 2). It is not until Marty realizes his error when he's about to meet Buford in the gun fight that he achieves this ideal and, much to Seamus's glee, says of Buford and the opinions surrounding him 'He's an asshole! I don't care what Tannen says, and I don't care what anyone else says either!' Because of this, he is able to avoid said accident.Also loaded with gags, references to other great westerns ('My name is Clint Eastwood.') and Doc's response to being asked if his hijacking the train is a hold up: 'It's a science experiment!'",Null,61,73,20 April 2004
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," It was... an improvement
","Reed Richards, AKA: Mr. Fantastic (Gruffud) and Susan 'Sue' Storm, AKA: The Invisible Woman (Alba) are trying to get married, but every time the wedding day arrives, some end-of-the-world scenario gets in the way. Case in point: just as they're about to have their 4th attempt at a wedding, the Silver Surfer (body of Doug Jones, voice of Laurence Fishburne) touches down and designates Earth to be the next life sustaining meal for his grand master, Galactus. So it's up to Reed, Sue, Sue's younger brother Johnny, AKA: the Human Torch (Chris Evans) and their big orange buddy Ben Grimm, AKA: The Thing (Michael Chikilis) to save the day, complicated by Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon) returning and stealing the Silver Surfer's surf board.Well, it's an improvement over the first film. 'Rise of the Silver Surfer' has a slightly tighter focus and the action/drama/comedy blends together more smoothly than before, the sense of scale is better, the action sequences are spiffy - of particular note the sight of the fragmenting foursome struggling to save a collapsing ferris wheel is far more awe inspiring than Superman lifting the giant continent of Kryptonite in Bryan Singer's woe be gone 2006 turkey 'Superman Returns' - and the Silver Surfer himself looks great. But Jessica Alba is still the weak link in the foursome; while Chikilis, Gruffud and Evans play their parts well enough, Alba's acting is simply not strong enough to be really convincing as the Invisible Woman. To be fair, Alba's not quite as annoying here as she was in the first film and manages to give the character a little more humanity, but still, she's just too much of a lightweight to really pull it off. And on top of that, the clearly Hispanic Alba (playing a white character) just looks silly with her hair bleached super blonde and sporting very fake looking blue contact lenses. And the continued use of Sue being caught with her clothes off in public fails to either amuse or even arouse, since Alba doesn't have the best body in the business, and even if she did, it would still be demeaning to the Invisible Woman, who was always a more classy, mature and wholesome comic book heroine, even if she did wear a skin tight blue suit. By having Sue repeatedly caught naked in public (or semi-naked), they're basically trying to force a sex appeal onto the character that was never really there to begin with, and I'm writing that as someone who usually enjoys seeing a good looking woman put on display. I'm writing this because I liked the Invisible Woman in the comics, she's easily one of the greatest female superheroes of all time, and to see her presented so poorly in the films is very disappointing.And as a friend of mine put it, Alba looks like she should be playing Evans' love interest instead of his OLDER sister (they were both born in 1981).And Reed Richards' dancing at his bachelor party outing will no doubt draw comparisons to 'evil Peter Parker' dancing in the street to funky James Brown music in 'Spider-Man 3'.Dr. Doom's still not getting the best treatment either. Instead of a regal monarch, we're still dealing with a guy who's like a poor man's Lex Luthor in an iron suit. And turning Galactus into a giant cloud instead of showing him as the big god like creature that he is in the comics was just ridiculous.Perhaps an inevitable Fantastic Four 3 will be the 'charm'?",5,1,3,10 October 2007

Black Hawk Down," Blood, Sweat & Bullets: The New Story of GI Joe
","The partly successful, partly disastrous 1993 mission in Somalia is recounted in a horrifyingly glorious storm of blood, sweat and bullets as American soldiers find themselves up against an entire city.
Hate to sound like a cheap ad, but director Ridley Scott (Blade Runner) has fashioned a war movie so powerful it leaves 'Pearl Harbor' (which also starred Josh Hartnett) looking like a bad 'GI Joe' cartoon. This is how a war movie should be: no romantic cliches of two soldier friends in love with the same woman, no flag waving glory crap, and no clearly drawn good guys or bad guys, even if our sympathies lie more with our own troops than the Somali war lords.Anchoring the film is a strong cast that features Sam Shepard, Jason Isaacs, Tom Sizemore, William Fitchner, Josh Hartnett, Eric Bana (in the role that made him a star in American eyes), Ewan McGregor, and Orlando Bloom in a small but crucial role as the man who falls out of the helicopter. It's an ironic bit of casting, seeing as how Bloom himself broke his back in real life and his claim to fame is playing the sleek, cat like Legalos in 'Lord of the Rings'. Just an actual incident recreated flawlessly and featuring violence so raw and powerful that you'd swear you were there (the first time I saw this film I swore I could taste the heat of the desert). Rarely is the horror of war so well depicted.This is also probably Josh Hartnett's best performance to date. He's not eye candy for the girls here, he's just playing a regular guy (who ironically was not that involved in the real incident). If he keeps this up, he might actually have a career worth remembering after his pretty boy looks have faded.Take it slow with this one.",8,0,0,8 April 2004
The Dark Knight," 'You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.'
","PLOT: Picking up where 'Batman Begins' left off, Batman (Christian Bale) and James Gordon (Gary Oldman) join forces with Gotham's new DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), dubbed 'The White Knight' by the press, to dismantle the remaining mob bosses in Gotham. But there's a new player in the game, a sadistic criminal called the Joker (the late Heath Ledger), and he's hellbent on destroying everyone and everything in his path, in one way or another.To put it simply, this is a powerful, moving film far beyond any previous comic book adaptations. The film truly is nothing short of superb. The late Heath Ledger was undeniably creepy & terrifying as the hateful, heartless, lip-licking, cackling Joker (and trust me, he does a great job of making you hate the Joker), while Aaron Eckhart delivers a powerful performance as the doomed DA Harvey Dent/2-Face, so powerful it makes me wish Eckhart was the one up for an Oscar nomination. Christian Bale is of course perfect as Batman/Bruce Wayne with the always welcomed Gary Oldman, Michael Caine & Morgan Freeman reprising their roles as Gordon, Alfred & Fox. Maggie Gyllenhaal lends nice support in the Rachel Dawes role originated by Katie Holmes (who is sadly better known now as Mrs. Tom Cruise #3).Can't wait for the next one... and it had better have Catwoman/Selina Kyle in it.",10,4,9,21 July 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," Style over substance
","I've often thought that the late Stanley Kubrick, while perhaps a visionary in his own eccentric right, was also one of the greatest violators of the style over substance concept. Take 'The Shining' for example, a film where style so clearly overpowers substance. Sure it scares you out of your wits, but there's no real depth or substance in it, just Jack Nicholson's gleefully go for broke performance. '2001: A Spacey Odyssey', on the other hand, is an epic science fiction masterpiece that ultimately goes nowhere (like the Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones). Starting with the beginning of man, then man's exploration of space, and finally, man going on the ultimate journey after his ship's super-computer betrays him. The film's technical execution is superb, but the story is flat and passionless. The music, that classic anthem, is more memorable than the actual film. Followed by a more emotionally involving sequel - '2010', starring Roy Scheider and John Lithgow. 'Open the pod bay doors, HAL.' - Dave'I'm sorry, Dave.

Men in Black," Will & Tommy
","After the success of 'Independence Day', Will Smith tackled another science fiction film though less serious than the previous one. Will is Agent Jay, recruited by Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) to be his partner and replacement from the NYPD and in their first adventure together they smite an evil, annoying alien bug played by Vincent D'Onofrio. Based on a cult comic book, 'Men In Black' was followed by an animated series and a sequel which brought back Agent Kay but used a terrible story to do it. The big reason this movie works is because Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones work so well together as the cocky youth and the experienced veteran, and they're chemistry is what made this film a hit. Some of the gags are great, others a tad predictable. Sadly, the sequel allowed them to slack and did not push them hard enough to actually work. Linda Fiorentino is nice eye candy, but Vincent D'Onofrio is never really evil or menacing as the obnoxious alien man bug Edgar, just annoying and smug. As a result of D'Onofrio's undisciplined  performance, the film is mildly irritating whenever he's on screen, sucking the joy out of it. But all in all, this one's pretty good. Will's song is actually rather catchy.",9,0,0,12 April 2004

Just as silent screen stars Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are about to make a new film 'The Cavalier', Don - who with each passing film is growing ever more weary of the ego-maniacal and delusional Lina - meets sweet virginal ingénue Kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds, AKA: Princess Leia's Mom), who aspires to be an actress in her own right.

Secretly a fan of his films but wishing not to appear to be a gushing fan girl, Kathy claims to be a stage actress and comments that she doesn't find film work to be all that professional or dignified as there is no sound or words, merely melodramatic gestures, which Don, who worked his way up long and hard from humble beginnings with his sardonic childhood piano playing friend Cosmo (Don O'Connor), finds insulting. Kathy is later humiliated when Don finds out that she's actually working as a song & dance girl at the very Grove where his party is being held, where she makes her grand entrance from a giant fake cake, her embarrassment fueling Don's smug amusement. When Don starts grilling Kathy about her 'profession', she tries to hit him with a pie, but ends up hitting his obnoxious screen partner Lina instead, which costs Kathy her job when Lina complains about it to the management. Don's frustration is pushed to critical mass by this, and finds he can't stop thinking about Kathy, feeling both guilty about her misfortune and his own confidence undermined by her words. Don later finds Kathy working as an extra for a musical number for another project at the studio where he works, Kathy's true fan girl colors are exposed, but in old school Hollywood fashion, Don & Kathy fall in love.Following this, Don's new film, 'The Cavalier' is besieged with problems as the studio tries to convert it into a sound picture (many of them taken from real life problems encountered during the sound conversion). When the film is given its initial test screening, the film is booed and mocked, as the audience beholds the now hammy, melodramatic acting of Don and Lina as well as Lina's glass shattering squeak of a voice. This serves as a blow to Don's pride and he figures that Kathy was right before, that he never was an actor, just a show-boater. Kathy and Cosmo encourage Don not to give up and, recognizing his skill with song and dance, suggest turning 'The Cavalier' into a musical, with Kathy dubbing Lina's speaking & singing voice. Lina eventually finds out and is none too pleased, and tries to ruin both Don's relationship with Kathy and Kathy's career, with Lina wisely utilizing her contract to manipulate the studio head R.F. Simpson and insisting that Kathy be uncredited her for work while continuing to be her uncredited 'voice' otherwise, Lina could sue the studio for contract violations. The newly musicalized film, reworked to have the hero fantasizing he's in the old time instead of being there, opens to be a rousing success, and Kathy & Don find out about Lina's wicked deed just after the film ends. Kathy is devastated, but just when all hope appears to be lost, Lina's ego gets the better of her as she makes her own speech for the first time, which confuses the audience as to how Lina could have such a beautiful voice on screen but a squeaky voice in person. Lina then insists that Kathy sing behind the scene to her lip sync, which Don encourages, annoying a disheartened Kathy who tries to disown him, but then, just as the sing/sync gets underway, Don, Cosmo and RF gleefully pull the curtain up, exposing the deception. Lina is finished, Kathy is now on top, and Kathy & Don live happily ever after.A bit long winded but still an engagingly bright musical comedy in the old school Hollywood musical tradition. Debbie Reynolds is adorable as the golden hearted Kathy. Don't miss the title song number.",8,0,1,4 June 2006
The Mummy Returns," Sometimes, I feel like I'm the only one who likes this movie.
","Picking up about 10 years later, Brendan and Rachael are now bound at the hip and they have a son, played by Freddie Boath. Then those pesky mummyworshippers show up, resurrecting Arnold Vosloo's Mummy priest and setforward a plan to either take over the world or destroy it, as it ties in with a prophecy about the Scorpion King (the Rock) returning from the dead with anarmy hellbent on destroying the world.Yeah I don't generally like prophecies, but this and 'Willow' (1988) areexceptions. The film moves faster than the first one (or at least I think so), has plenty of light hearted humor and action sequences to make it fun and it has a cool song at the end by the band LIVE. Brendan is his usual entertaining self, and that guy who played Izzy is pretty damn funny.Good watching for the spring or summer time.This one was followed by 'The Scorpion King'.",7,0,0,16 April 2004
The Last Samurai," Dances With Samurai
","It's part Braveheart and part Dances With Wolves, this movie deemed both insane and not insane enough. Tom Cruise, in what might be one of his better performances, plays an unhappy Union soldier on the skids who is hired by the Japanese government to come down to Japan and train their men in the way of modern warfare and help them destroy the stubborn samurai who refuse to bow down, namely their charismatic leader Ken Watanabe. But Tom gets captured and he eventually falls in love with the Samurai way of life and the ideals that Ken and his cohorts cling to. He also falls in love with Ken's sister, who's husband he killed. Does it end triumphantly or tragically? Alas I cannot say.Part of me really wanted to enjoy this film and to a certain end that part of me did enjoy the film. The film is far from perfect but it's not bad for what it is even if it does borrow a lot of elements from earlier films and restages them. Ken Watanabe is very compelling even when he spouts bad dialogue (one can only imagine how many more diverse roles he's played in his native Japan).",4,0,1,17 June 2004
The Fly," 'I am NOT an insect! I am a human being! I... AM... A... MAN!'
","Contains Spoilers!! That's what I kept expecting Jeff Goldblum to yell when he started turning into the fly.Anyway, in this uniquely perverse remake of the 1950s cult classic, Jeff Goldblum plays Seth Brundle, brilliant but lonely mad scientist who suffers from motion sickness and has five sets of the same suit so that he doesn't have to waste time thinking about what he'll wear. And for a guy who's supposed to be a nerd, he has quite the physique, as someone else around here has already pointed out.While attending a science fair exhibit funded by his company, Seth meets a beautiful science magazine reporter/journalist named Veronica (Geena Davis, Jeff's ex-wife). After Seth strikes up a conversation with Veronica he tries to impress her by showing her his latest invention - telepods for teleporting things back and forth, an idea he coined up so that he could avoid getting car sick. You can imagine how many times Veronica's been hit on with the line 'I'm working on something that'll change the world as we know it,' but in Seth's case he can back it up with his pods. Veronica initially mocks his pods but then he transports her pantyhose through the thing and she believes. Unfortunately, Seth overlooked the fact that as a journalist Veronica will naturally try to write an article about the pods and he begs her not to write anything because the pods aren't perfected yet. At this point, the pods can only transport non-living things, it can't do things that are alive, as he later shows when he tries to teleport a baboon with tragic results. Fortunately Veronica's editor and ex-boyfriend Stathis Borans (John Getz) initially scoffs at Seth as a con man, which works out great for Seth because he makes Veronica an offer she can't refuse: chronicle his experiments and she can write a whole book about it once he gets the pods to work. Veronica eventually succumbs to the nerdy charms of Seth and the two have a torrid love affair. After sleeping together and experimenting a little bit with a steak, Seth theorizes that he needs to reprogram the pods to look at living things differently. Seth irons the bugs out while Veronica, in a gesture of romantic affection, buys Seth a brown leather jacket along with some other clothes to add variety to his wardrobe and when she comes back Seth manages to teleport another baboon without killing it. S&V plan to have a little romantic get away but their planning is interrupted when Veronica goes to confront Stathis about his plans to exploit Seth for all he's worth when she finds a magazine cover with her name on it sent to Seth's place (Stathis did a little background check and realized that Seth's no joke). In stereotypical man behavior, Seth drinks himself jealous and tests the telepods on himself, unaware that there's a fly in the machine. After teleporting, Seth looks the same but there's something different: he's suddenly a super athlete capable of having sex for hours on end! He's also become more emotionally exuberant, which = a bad temper.Believing that the pods has improved him, Seth becomes unreasonably angry when Veronica refuses to let him teleport her and goes out and cheats on her in hopes of finding a girl who is willing to become part of the 'Dynamic Duo Club'. Veronica also notices weird hairs growing out of Seth's back and when she gets them analyzed, turns out they're not human. Seth refuses to believe anything's wrong and angrily throws her out, only to finally realize that something's wrong when he looks in the mirror, notices how ugly he suddenly is and his finger nails start falling out along with some nasty substance. Seth double checks things on the computer and finds out about the fly that was in the pod when he teleported himself.After 4 weeks alone, Seth calls Veronica and she sees him turning into a hideous zombie spewing fly vomit in order to eat and stuff like his ear falling off. He explains a bout the fly and how the pods didn't know what to do with the two different DNA structures so it spliced them together, meaning he's turning into a giant bug! As the mutation continues, Seth's emotional state wildly bounces back and forth from scared/horrified to crazy fascination ('The Life & Times of Brundlefly... it should make a great children's book.'), as shown when he gleefully demonstrates his fly table manners. Stathis himself doesn't realize the depth of things until he sees the tape of Seth eating. Then it gets worse - Veronica's pregnant with Seth's kid!Fearing what the child may be when its born, she tries to get an abortion after failing to tell Seth (who now looks like the Toxic Avenger, as someone else pointed out) the truth but he comes after her and kidnaps her from the hospital and begs her not to kill their child as it could be the last of his old self. Stathis comes to Seth's place literally gunning for him and finds out about the only cure Seth could find: fuse himself with another human being. Seth attacks Stathis and Stathis tries to shoot him but he is no match for super-fly (Superman-fly?) and gets his hand and foot melted off. Seth tells Veronica that he has to fuse her to him in order to save himself but when she struggles to keep out of the pod she knocks his jaw off and the last of Seth's old body falls apart as he turns into a giant bug. Stathis manages to shoot the door so Veronica can get out and tries to trap 'Brundlefly' in the other pod, but when B-fly tries to escape, the pods teleport it and it exchanges its legs with rods. The last bit of Seth left in the monster asks Veronica to [mercy] kill him by touching the shotgun to its head. Veronica complies and the movie ends with her weeping for her dead lover after blowing his head off.Never was there a tale of more woe than of Veronica and her Seth, oh...Director David Cronenberg said the film wasn't so much a metaphor for AIDS (though I can see how people might feel that way, as Jeff literally falls to pieces) but more a metaphor for aging, that we all become monsters as we deteriorate. I'll never look at Jeff Goldblum the same way again (Brundle-Fly is permanently fused in my memory) but he turns in a heart breaking performance as the ill-fated scientist. He really got my sympathy going when he delivered lines like 'The baby could be all that's left of the real me... please don't kill me.' Geena Davis is also good as his lover. Not for all audiences.",8,4,8,26 April 2004
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," This is some above average stuff here...
","Initially I was against this series because the kids leave such huge messes at the cinema where I work. Then I decided to rent the first movie and give it a look to see what it is the kids love about it so much. Then it hit me: it's the story of a no talent underdog who overcomes great obstacles with a little help from his friends. And who doesn't like that? Overall, I'd say this is above average. I thought the three kids, Radcliffe (Harry), Grint (Ron), and Watson (Hermione), gave capable performances, oh, as did Felton, who played Draco. Also worthy of mention are Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Robbie Coltrane. If this film has any failing it may be that they try too hard to remind us of Harry's importance (he IS important, but isn't that obvious from the fact that he's the title character?).So give it a rental. 7/10",2,3,6,17 March 2003
Castle in the Sky," He Shot That Poor Girl's Hair Off!!!
","PLOT IN A NUTSHELL: A young miner boy named Pazu, who dreams of proving the existence of the Castle in the Sky known as Laputa, a small part of which his father photographed many years ago, finds his life turned upside down when a mysterious girl named Sheeta (Shita in the original Japanese version) literally falls into his arms with an even more mysterious crystal hanging around her neck. Two factions are after her - a family of goofy pirates led by the elderly yet energetic Dola and government agents led by the sinister Muska allegedly on behalf of the military. But what is Muska truly after? Hayao Miyazaki's second full length animated feature has all the abundant energy and miraculous flying machinery one has come to expect from his colorful and seemingly boundless imagination. Lush, beautiful animation brings a miraculous story of good vs. evil to life in a way that few films can.I have never heard the original English language dub, but from what I've read it was assembled very quickly and was quite poor as a result, with its cast (which included Barbara Goodson and Lara Cody as the child leads) settling for just reading the dialogue without actually performing it. The Disney re-dub, recorded in 1998 but not released until 2003, is very good and will make the adventure enjoyable even for most subtitle purists. The only voice in the English version that doesn't quite work is Anna Pacquin as Sheeta. Anna is not exactly a great actress to begin with, but it doesn't take someone with Katherine Hepburn level talent to maintain a consistent voice, but this is something Anna herself is not able to do in this feature. Her voice is ultimately all over the place, sounding American one moment and then sounding like a British teenager in other parts and sadly not fitting the appearance of Sheeta at all. As Pazu, James Van Der Beek sounds more like a teenager than a little boy, but at least his voice is consistent and even his detractors would have a hard time denying that he brings a lot of energy to the role. However, the real stars of the English dub are Cloris Leachman as Dola and Mark Hamill as Muska. Leachman has plenty of fun with the wily pirate mother, while Hamill delivers a brilliantly sinister and cold blooded performance as Muska, arguably the only real villain Miyazaki has ever featured in any of his films. While Miyazaki's other films feature antagonists who have some redeeming qualities, whether it's showing kindness to the less fortunate (such as Lady Eboshi in 'Princess Mononoke') or turn around and become somewhat better people (Witch of the Waste in Miyazaki's adaptation of 'Howl's Moving Castle'), Muska has none of these sympathetic qualities. He's not fallen, he's not misguided, he's just bad, I mean he is just plain BAD, a power hungry tyrant who'll stop at nothing to get what he wants, including shooting a little girl's hair off one pigtail at a time (that image is burned into my memory, for better or worse, as one of the most disturbing acts of violence I've ever seen in a film), and Hamill plays him with just the right amount of flamboyant relish. At times the former Star Wars hero's Joker voice (from the various DCAU projects he was a part of) creeps in, but there's certainly nothing wrong with that.But no matter which language you watch it in, 'Laputa: Castle in the Sky' is easily in the top 5 of must see Miyazaki films.",10,3,4,16 June 2010
The Untouchables," Untouchable
","Probably Kevin Costner's finest film, he plays the earnest Eliot Ness, the federal agent who wanted to bring down Al Capone anyway legally possible but eventually gave in to the teachings of his Irish mentor Jim Malone (Sean Connery!) and started to fight dirty and ultimately used blackmail to thwart Capone.Costner has rarely been better, and he has strong support from Connery in his award winning performance and from Andy Garcia and Robert DeNiro.
What could have been an ordinary crime drama is given lots of flamboyant visual flair by the director, who films his action sequences in slow motion and with plenty of well applied tension. Memorable parts include the build up to Connery's murder, the shoot out at the train station and Costner throwing the smug killer off the court house roof.A strong film. Give it a look.

The Matrix Reloaded," The what, what, what now?
","Often spectacular but often absurdly dense, 'Reloaded' tries to elaborate on the prophecy and plot point of the first film by cranking out a bunch of pseudo-fortune cookie dialogue philosophy about freedom and rebirths in a vain attempt to appear 'deep' and 'spiritual' but merely comes across as ridiculous. Fight sequences are grand, and that's about the only reason to bother watching except for a few nice moments between Keanu Reeves' Neo and Carrie-Anne Moss's Trinity.The Architect and Merovingian are also major low points.Do keep in mind that in real life the human body does not generate enough energy to be a viable heat source, not even if you got billions of human beings together.",Null,0,2,6 April 2006

","Okay but unmemorable thriller about Sean Penn's character trying to find out who murdered his obnoxious teenage daughter (Emmy Rossum) and learning to deal with life after her death. Tim Robbins plays a tortured ex-friend of Penn's and Kevin Bacon plays another former friend of Penn's who is now a cop working with Laurence Fishburne to find the killer, and all the evidence points to the long-suffering Robbins character, who was once molested by two weirdos as a little kid. But is he the killer? You know it tries hard, but it never really comes together the way it should. I've always felt that Sean Penn was a bit over-rated as well as smug and off-putting; I thought he was good here but I don't think he necessarily deserved the best actor Oscar for it. On the other hand, its a nice change of pace to see Kevin Bacon playing a character who isn't in smarmy super-jerk mode.",Null,0,0,4 October 2004

Similarly, Jude Law and his fellow Russians have British accents but there are no official British characters to be found anywhere.Jude Law is the Russian sniper who is turned into a folk hero by his newspaper printing pal and fellow soldier Joe Fiennes and later ends up competing with him for the affections of 'The Mummy' babe Rachael Weisz. Naturally, Rachael favors the gun toting Jude over man of the written word Joe, which leads to jealousy on both fronts before Joe ultimately sacrifices himself to help Jude in his cat and mouse game against German sniper Ed Harris.The acting is fine and the film looks and feels rightly gritty, but is marred by the tired scenario of the two soldier buds in love with the same woman.",Null,1,2,15 April 2004
Die Hard," 'Is the building on fire?'
","No doubt about it, to a lot of people, Bruce Willis will ALWAYS be John McClane, for better or worse.In the film that made him a star, or at least got him out of TV work, Bruce Willis is New York native cop John McClane, come down to LA to see his estranged wife and family for the Christmas holiday. Then Hans (Alan Rickman, in one of his best evil performances) and a group of thieves posing as terrorists who look European male models and an obnoxious black computer hacker show up, take over the building and try to rob the place. Only McClane can stop them, and his only real support comes from Sgt. Al Powell (played by the dad from TV's 'Family Matters'). Calamity, chaos and mayhem ensue as McClane and the foreign thugs tear the building apart trying to kill each other in the ultimate battle of all American cowboy hero and sophisticated Eurotrash and the idiot cops and FBI gets trip over themselves to help out.Based on the novel by Roderick Thorpe. Bonnie Bedelia is Bruce's wife, and the late Alexander Godunov is Karl, who's vendetta with Bruce turns personal. Bonnie does well as the sympathetic wife with a bad haircut and Godunov, in a role very different from his debut part as an Amish farmer in 'Witness', is surprisingly menacing in spite of his pretty boy looks. Of course, it helps that his career as a ballet dancer gave him more dexterity than the usual hulking henchman. His knock-down-drag-out brawl with Willis is one of the best.Alan Rickman commented that he didn't view Hans as 'the villain', but more as a guy who 'has made certain choices in life, wants certain things in life and goes after them.' All the same, Alan is the perfect villain for Bruce's wise cracking McClane, who is neither weak nor super human. Bruce worked very hard on this film and allegedly did a lot of his own stunts and really brought a lot of life and warmth to a character who could very easily have been just another grim loner. It's a shame that he's had to spend the majority of his career trying to get away from this character (kind of like Sean Connery trying to live down his glory days as James Bond). And to think that Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Burt Reynolds and Richard Gere all turned this part down (probably better that they did).
Sadly, the appeal of the McClane character was lost in #3 'Die Hard: With A Vengeance', where McClane HAD become a grim, burned out, wasted loner.
A big part of the power of 'Die Hard' is that there are no easy escapes, very few places to run and very little 'cheating' as director John McTiernan put it. And it's true that very few moments require you to suspend logical disbelief, although we do have to question if it's possible to successfully pull of the stunt where Bruce jumps off the building with a hose wrapped around him.So grab the popcorn and get ready for the madness of 'Die Hard'! This is actually one of the few action films my family and I enjoy watching together. This was actually filmed at the 20th Century Fox Plaza.",10,3,3,9 April 2004
Psycho," The other film that was based on Ed Gein
","Ed Gein was a mid-west farmer who's unnatural relationship with his mother led to a very troubled life that had tragic consequences for some of his town's inhabitants. Ed's story inspired two horror or 'slasher' films - this and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. 'Psycho' was in fact based on a story that was based on Ed and made a classic by Hitchcock, who may have set one of the big rules for the 'slasher' genre - sex and death are linked.
The film both made a star of and typecast Anthony Perkins, who proved to be most memorable as the title character, AKA: Norman Bates. Anthony reprised the Bates role in three sequels. Part of the key as to why this film worked as that Anthony Perkins, tall, gangly, shy and down cast in demeanor, didn't look psychotic, whereas Vince Vaughn, who took his role in the remake, does.
Bates encounters fugitive on the run Marion Crane becomes infatuated with her, but 'mother' disapproves of her and kills her in the shower. Then Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles, one of the Tarzans ex-wives if I'm not mistaken, Gordon Scott I think) and boyfriend Sam Loomis (later the name of the doctor in 'Halloween') come looking for her and the horrible truth about Norman and 'mother' is revealed.

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Flashy? Yes. Less annoying than Episodes I and II? Yes. Star Wars prequel trilogy and George Lucas redeemed? Not quite
","Well, here we are, the big one, the one that was supposed to blow them all away, the one that was supposed to be the meat and potatoes of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, the big downfall that turned Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) into Darth Vader. The final result is a bit... underwhelming.To be fair, this is probably the least annoying of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, some of the acting is sturdier, the violence is grand as always, there are some very decently dark atmospheric moments, and the lack of the loathsome Jar Jar Binks is appreciated (too bad he had to appear at the end mourning the death of what's-her-name), but it still cannot touch the original Star Wars trilogy. If viewed as a stand alone film, Episode III may not seem all that bad by itself, but when the final turn of Anakin into Vader comes, it's hard to take it seriously or feel affected at all because of the weak story foundation of the previous entries, 'Phantom Menace' and 'Clones', and the fact that Lucas failed to build Anakin up to be a sympathetic character. So what if we all knew where he was going to end up? Lucas should have worked a lot harder on Anakin's character ark instead of fiddling around the special effects. Star Wars, once one of the great space operas of cinema, is now and forever truly synonymous with the term 'style over substance', quantity over quality, flogging a dead horse for the sake of the all mighty dollar, and George Lucas's name really is now permanently connected with 'hack'. Yes, I'm well aware that all Hollywood films are for money, but this prequel block buster trilogy is just poorly and insincerely concocted that it makes the eyes and the ears bleed.Ultimately, all that crap starting in Episode I with Anakin leaving his mother for no bloody good reason, taking ten years to get back to her for no bloody good reason, all the various stretches of logic and credibility (like the Jedi being killed by robots and clones) and the poorly handled friendship between Obi-Wan and Anakin amounts to a mind numbingly banal experience. That's the real heart of the problem: the friendship between Obi-Wan and Anakin never becomes real or believable, despite how hard the actors try, and this all goes back to the fact that Episode I failed to properly portray the beginning of the beginning of their friendship, choosing instead of focus on that pointless waste of time called Qui-Gon Jinn (and this is coming from a person who generally likes Liam Neeson's films).Ewan McGregor and Samuel L. Jackson do their best, and while they're more bearable to watch than some of the other actors - McGregor does a great job of portraying Obi-Wan's horror and anguish when the big duel between him and Anakin is done - they can't save this movie. Ian McDiarmid (the Emperor) is hammy as usual and Natalie Portman is as flat here as she was in the first two prequels, lacking the Earthiness that made Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia so endearing. Hayden Christensen tries hard to squeeze something resembling sympathy from Anakin, and while he's not exactly the greatest actor of all time, the truth is his failure is unsurprising. Odds are that Anakin would have seemed like a hollow jerk regardless of who was playing him, given how bad Lucas's dialogue and direction has become over the years.Let us hope and pray that they fail to make Indiana Jones 4.",1,8,14,6 April 2006
Back to the Future Part II," The madness continues...
","On the surface, the 'Back to the Future' trilogy is a light hearted comedy that occasionally shows the potential danger of time travel. Look deeper though and you'll find that it's also a metaphor about what it means to be a man. In the first film, being a man was defined as having the guts to stand up for yourself. In the sequels, this notion is turned on its ear, suggesting that being a man also means you have to know when to reign yourself in. But more on that later.Picking up where the first film left off, Doc whisks Marty and his girlfriend/future wife Jennifer (exit Claudia Wells, enter Elisabeth Shue, who, like Michael J. Fox, clearly looks too old to be playing a teenager) to the year 2015 so they can sort out some family problems. Well, primarily Marty has to sort out the problems, Doc puts Jennifer out because she's not important to the plan (in actuality, the writers were too lazy to make her part bigger so they just put her under). The immediate problem Doc needs Marty to contend with is that his future son Marty Jr. is going to be arrested for taking part in a robbery that is being concocted by Griff Tannen, grandson of Biff Tannen (both played by Thomas F. Wilson; Griff's parents are never shown). Since Jr. is the spitting image of Marty, Marty is able to take his place but before he does so, he witnesses what a wimp his son is and, while posing as his son, the extremely old man version of Biff mistakes Marty for Jr. ('Say hi to your grandma for me kid.') and taunts him about a mistake he has yet to make. Marty's temper gets him into trouble with Griff and leads to a chase on hover-boards that's essentially a slicked up version of the skateboard chase from #1. Marty gets Griff in trouble and as a result his son is saved from being arrested, but then Jennifer is picked up by some cops and, thinking she's had one hell of a face lift, they take her to her future home, where she wakes up and spies on her future family. She overhears future in laws Lorraine (Leah Thompson) and George (exit Crispin Glover, enter Jeff Weissman) talking about a car accident that Marty got into where he permanently injured his guitar hand and was unable to pursue his music ambitions, which led to a wasted life in a power plant and unhappy life with his family. Middle aged Marty is in even worse shape than his father originally was, and then, having not learned his lesson from the car accident, he gets himself fired for letting a co-worker, the same guy who got him in that accident, goad him into illegal activity! Jennifer then faints when she confronts her middle aged self and is taken back to 1985 by Doc and Marty.Except 1985 has changed once again! Biff Tannen, now a successful millionaire, has taken over the town, murdered George and married Lorraine while the alternate Marty is in a boarding school somewhere and the alternate Doc is in a mental institution! Fortunately, the 'real' Doc is on hand with the 'real' Marty and they remember that Marty left a sports almanac in the time machine because he wanted to place a few bets, but Biff caught wind of this, stole the time machine and gave the almanac to his younger self in 1955 so that he could make himself rich: that is why Hill Valley is now a living hell and Marty's mom Lorraine is trapped in an abusive/loveless marriage where she is forced to look like a middle aged whore. After realizing that this is basically all his fault, Marty and Doc go back in time and follow the two Biffs around to get the almanac back from him, but Marty's temper nearly thwarts them when Biff calls him 'chicken'. Well, they manage to get the almanac and burn it, thus restoring the original alternate time line from the first film, but the time machine is struck by lightning and sends Doc back to 1885!The whole reversed manhood message comes to full circle in part 3.
Ironically, the plot here came to be due to the studio's inability to work out a deal with Crispin Glover for the George McFly part. Elisabeth Shue is wasted as Jennifer, but she has a few funny if typical 'girl humor' moments (like her excitement at being able to see her future wedding and her shock at seeing her older self). Why Fox plays his own daughter is unknown (maybe he felt he felt he owed to his co-stars). Still, the film is pretty funny in a slightly darker way (though the future of 2015 is refreshingly brighter than most futures). My favorite line is 'I feel like we're in hell or something./No, it's most definitely Hill Valley, but I can't imagine how HELL could be much worse!'",Null,0,1,20 April 2004

While there, he is captured & injured by Afghan terrorists who expect him to build them weapons in his last days as shrapnel eats away at his heart (from a missile he built no less). Instead, with the help of fellow inventor Ysen, he builds an iron combat suit and uses it to escape. Upon returning home, Stark experiences something of a morale awakening and decides to undo his career of military backing. This also includes building a better iron suit so that he can combat the forces of evil with it. Stane, who was plotting against him all along, is not pleased with this, leading to an inevitable clash between the two.Infamous for his own real life substance abuse, Downey Jr. turns in an excellent performance as Ton Stark/Iron Man, bringing warmth, humor and humanity to a character whom some may not relate to easily. The film as a whole is excellently cast, with Bridges a stand out as the evil Stane and Paltrow as Stark's 'girl Friday'. After enduring the bland, lifelessly uncharismatic and far too youthful Brandon Routh & Kate Bosworth in the equally bland & boring 'Superman Returns', the chemistry of seasoned pros Downey & Paltrow is a welcome breath of fresh air in an industry that is growing far too youth obsessed.An overall fun film with an excellent balance of humor and drama. I look forward to the future adventures of this Iron Man.Stay after the credits to see an amusing cameo from Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury.",10,2,6,5 May 2008
Blade Runner," Runner of the Blade
","Based on the book 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' by the late Philip K. Dick.Ford is Rick Deckard, a burned out bounty hunter cop officially called a BLADE RUNNER who was charged with the job of killing cyborgs called 'replicants', who are human like in appearance but can be built with super strength, super stamina, super everything, including super intelligence, or they can be built to be stupid. A group of replicants led by Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) has made it to Earth from an off world colony (the late Brion James as Leon, Joanna Cassidy as Zora, and a pre-Splash Daryl Hannah as Priss). Even though replicants are supposed to die after 4 years in order to keep them from copying human emotions too accurately, they still cause problems, which leads to the creation of blade runners being employed to kill them. Deckard is yanked out of retirement when the blade runner who was assigned to 'retire' (kill) them is put on a ventilator by Leon and given orders to pick up where the other guy left off. First, however, Deckard meets Rachael (Sean Young), a replicant who doesn't even know that she's a replicant but is 'beginning to suspect' and later has a torrid love affair with Deckard, leaving Deckard with the ethical dilemma of either killing her or hiding her.But is Deckard himself a genuine human? Hopefully not, because that would take all the sting and exoticism out of his relationship with Rachael. But you never know, he may very well be one of them, as he takes a horrible beating all throughout the film and always manages to survive.
Harrison Ford is fine in his usual quiet demeanor, but the film is stolen from him by Rutger Hauer with his intense, off beat performance as Roy Batty, the near Christ like Replicant leader. However, the film is dedicated to them in different halves before they meet for the climax. A flop at the box office in 1982 in light of the new desire of the time for dashing, swashbuckling adventure films, it has found its audience and appreciation in the years that followed,Visually stunning, best suited to night time viewing.",10,1,2,9 April 2004
Ben-Hur," Born to Run... or race, rather
","Watching a film like this and 'The Ten Commandments', it's easy to see why Kirk Douglas had Charlton Heston in mind when he spoke about actors famous for playing heroes who must have really believed that heroes existed.A few years after he scored a bulls eye with 'The Ten Commandments', Charlton Heston plays the title character, Judah Ben-Hur, a Jewish Prince enslaved by Masala (Stephen Boyd), the very man who was his best friend when they were children. In addition to enslaving Ben (Heston), Masala breaks up Ben's family and imprisons his mother and sister. After enduring years of pain and punishment, Ben is freed by Roman General Jack Hawkins for saving his life at sea, becomes his chariot racer and surrogate son, and is later freed to do what he will. Along with acquiring a girlfriend, Ben tracks down Masala and threatens to to beat the crap out of him if he doesn't release his family and if they're dead, then he's as good as gone. When they find that his mom and sis have the plague, his girlfriend lies to him and tells him that they're dead and that his mom's last words were to get on with life because they don't want him to see what they've become. But Ben is mad and does the only thing an angry man can do: he destroys his friend-come-enemy Masala in the chariot race, only to regret slaying him later, especially after Masala tells him his mom and sis are actually still alive.
After tracking them down and struggling with lots of conflicting feelings, Ben's mom and sis are cured by the Lord and they live as happily ever after as possible during this particular era, as it happens to be the time of Christ's death and resurrection.This ranks with 'The Ten Commandments' as being one of Heston's best films. Once again, Heston is right at home in this giant epic and his chiseled in stone features, physique, deep voice and dignity are utilized to great effect. Despite his lack of scren time, Boyd is a strong foil to Heston, who dominates almost every scene he's in. Plus everything surrounding Heston and the cast is great: beautiful sets, well designed costumes and the spectacular chariot race. This one deserves its place in the pantheon of Hollywood classics.",10,0,2,8 April 2004
Signs," You'll either love it or you'll hate it
","M. Night Shyamalan seems to have a knack for writing and directing both bizarre films and offering actors who's careers may or may not be a stalling a chance to give new and interesting characterizations.
Exit Bruce Willis, enter Mel Gibson. Mel's played the larger than life hero so many times we've almost forgotten films like 'Tim' and 'Man Without A Face'. So naturally he tackled this film in hopes of reminding people that there's more to him than just Mad Max, Martin Riggs and all those other tough guys.Mel plays a down and out widower reverend who's all cut off from his kids and has a live in brother played by Joaquim Phoenix. When all sorts of weird things start happening like crazy dogs and crop circles, the logical explanation is of course, aliens.It's not quite successful though. Mel's too mechanical and flat for you to really identify with him. Sometimes unintentionally funny, you keep expecting the irony to be that Mel is the alien. Mel is actually upstaged by Phoenix as his would be baseball playing star. The kids get on your nerves after a while.",3,2,3,9 April 2004
Beowulf," A valiant effort
","Adapted very loosely from the original poem - without which we would not have the plot archetype of 'band of heroic warriors travel into unknown territory to fight an unknown menace they may not be able to handle' that served writers so well in the centuries that followed, from the sword & sorcery epics to hard hitting science fiction action films like ALIENS (1986) and PREDATOR (1987) - big rugged muscle bound Beowulf (Ray Winstone) is asked by fat old has-been turned drunken degenerate King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) to kill a pesky monster known as Grendel (Crispin Glover) that's been terrorizing Hrothgar's kingdom. Beowulf does as asked - in the nude no less - then goes to kill the big whiny voice brute's mother (Angelina Jolie). The result? Grendle's mom, who appears to be a hot mama shape-shifter, seduces Beowulf, has sexual intercourse with him and then curses him. Hrothgar declares Beowulf his heir, since he has no sons of his own, leaves the kingdom and his lovely, love lorn wife Queen Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn) to big B before committing suicide. Years later, an old but still very buff Beowulf finds he must confront a dragon, which turns out to be the shape-shifting son he had with Grendel's mom. Turns out Hrothgar made the same mistake as Beowulf many years ago - he thought with his balls instead of with his brains, slept with Grendel's mom, Grendel was the son of that encounter, and being terrorized by Grendel was Hrothgar's curse, and probably another reason why his wife wouldn't sleep with him, besides the fact that - yet again - Wealthow was a beautiful young lady trapped in a loveless marriage to a man old enough to be her father (or possibly grandfather). By this point, old Beowulf's relationship with the equally old queen is also on the rocks and he's taken to sleeping around with wenches (one particular wench played by Alison Lohman), just as Hrothgar did, but before he goes off to fight the dragon, he tries to reconcile with her. Beowulf fights the dragon - cutting his arm off in the process - dies a hero's death, names his long time sensible best friend Wiglaf (Brendan Gleeson) to take his place as king, then at the end Wiglaf is confronted by Grendel's mother, and it is left ambiguous as to whether Wiglaf will succumb to temptation just as Beowulf and Hrothgar did, or if Wiglaf will have the good sense to stay away from the horrid she-demon, thus ending the cycle.Entertaining as throw away entertainment, but those looking for an honest adaptation of the original poem may be disappointed with the liberties taken. Though Beowulf is still one tough cookie, he's not quite as heroic as the original poem made him out to be, as the screenplay chooses to play him up as a flawed, self-loathing & regretful anti-hero, probably in hopes of making him more appealing to the cynical, jaded audiences of the 21st century, yet you can't help but wonder if that basically defeats the purpose of what his character stands for in the original poem (films such as 'Troy' and 'Superman Returns' had a similar problem). Beowulf fighting naked came across as unintentionally funny seeing as how they had to keep hiding his frontal private parts with whatever objects are handy (while it's true he chose to fight without weapons against Grendel in the book, he did not strip himself naked to fight the monster); other bits of nudity (both male & female) or just outright exploitation (zooming in on a bar woman's twitching bosom) feels even more crass here than it would in live action, and reeks of desperation for attention, as if to say 'Look! We're pure CGI but we're doing stuff with CGI that wasn't done in Shrek or Toy Story!', a desperation that would make even Ralph Bakshi (who made a similar attempt with animation & radioscopy decades ago) roll his eyes. Also, the original poem contained no romantic subplot between Beowulf and the queen, Hrothgar and his wife did have children, Beowulf killed Grendel's mom (he wore armor BTW) and while Beowulf did become king and die fighting a dragon, he became king of a different area, and the dragon was not his offspring. For all these creative liberties, they may as well have just changed all the names of the characters and called it something else (thinkg the 2004 bomb 'King Arthur'). Beowulf himself looked quite real at times, as did certain props and backgrounds, but other characters were not so fortunate, as the CGI stop motion bit is clearly not completely ironed out yet (empty eyes, vacant stares, puffy faces, etc). The action sequences are quite good though; when they cut loose, they really cut loose. The 'acting' as it were is decent. Film tries hard, I will give it that. Probably best watched as a separate entity unto itself than as a true adaptation of the poem.",7,1,3,3 December 2007
X2: X-Men United," AKA: Wolverine Kicks Some Ass
","Picking up where the first one left off, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) returns to the mansion after his search for answers into his past have proven fruitless and just as he shows up, everyone's running off in different directions following a mutant assassination attempt of the president. Professor X (Patrick Stewart) goes to the imprisoned Magneto (Ian McKellan) for answers and gets gassed and captured along with Cyclops (James Marsden). Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) and Storm (Halle Berry) track down the would be mutant assassin, who turns out to be Night Crawler (Alan Cumming), who claims that he has no memory of what he was doing there or why. While watching the mansion, Wolverine and the students (Yes, the school actually does have students) are attacked by a bunch of commandos working for a mysterious mutant hater named William Stryker (Brian Cox). Some of the students escape - thanks to man of steel Colossus (Daniel Cudmore) - and some of them are captured, Wolverine kills some of them and escapes with a still wimpy Rogue (a still miscast Anna Paquin), her in movie only boyfriend Bobby Drake/Ice Man (Shawn Ashmore), and John/Pyro to be (Aaron Stanford, replacing whoever that was who was playing him in the first movie) to Bob's house, where his family finally learns he's a mutant and his little brother rats them out to the cops. Well, Magento escapes thanks to Mystique (Rebecca R-Stamos) and a reluctant alliance is formed between the X-Men and Magento to rescue Professor X from Styker, who's trying to use him to kill all the mutants on Earth and is then switched by Magneto to kill all the humans.
Faster, more action, more special effects, and more humor, this is all in all an improvement over the first. However, the climax in which Jean Grey apparently sacrifices herself by using her telekinetic powers to hold back the water spilling out of the dam so as not to bury the X-jet and is herself engulfed by the waters and apparently destroyed, simply doesn't ring true. I mean, Storm and Ice Man were RIGHT THERE, why didn't they just get out and freeze the damn water? Oh right, because that would make sense, would be too easy and the writers were too lazy to think of a more convincing way for Jean to bite the dust. Of course, we all know that Jean will be back in an adaptation of the Phoenix saga...I would have liked to have seen less Night Crawler (despite Alan Cumming's snappy performance) and more Colossus, and there is still too much focus on Wolverine, but all in all, it's not a bad film. Watered down maybe, but not bad.Trivia note: in the comic books, Mystique is Night-Crawler's mother, but this is not mentioned in the film.",Null,0,0,22 April 2004
The Sixth Sense," Dr. Willis
","Possible spoilers...Bruce plays a child shrink who gets attacked by a former patient and it sends his life into a downward spiral. He eventually gets caught up in the life of Haley Joel Osmont, a kid who claims that he 'sees dead people'. What follows is a truly creepy epic of red, the undead, and an exploration of personal problems and dysfunctional relationships. What is the meaning of the 6th Sense?One of the best of the many anti-Die Hard Bruce Willis performances, he has rarely been better in a film elsewhere (except 'Die Hard'). HJ himself isn't bad as the kid with the title sense, but his follow up work has been a bit much to digest.I think this is actually the only film by Mr. M. Night Shyamalan or however you spell his name that doesn't make use of water. See it for Bruce.",Null,0,1,9 April 2004
Cinderella," I know, I can't believe I'm writing a review either
","Walt Disney & his 9 Old Men put their own 1950 spin on the classic fairy tale of Cinderella, which I guess you could say helps form an unofficial 'fairy tale princess trilogy' from the classic Disney years.THE PLOT: Cinderella is a nice girl who can't catch a break. She is the daughter of a nice, wealthy widower who loved her dearly, but her mother passed away when Cinderella was very young, and Cindy's father felt she needed a mother figure, so he eventually married the woman who would become known as Lady Tremaine, herself a widow with two daughters about the same age as Cinderella, Anastasia and Drizella. At first they all seemed to get along, but then Cinderella's father died, and Lady Tremaine's true nature was revealed - she was a cold, cruel, callous, heartless, mean spirited woman, and she passed those traits on to her daughters, who were spoiled, bratty, and equally mean spirited. Anastasia & Drizella hate Cinderella because they know deep down that she's better looking and an overall nicer, more attractive lady than themselves (i.e., more appealing to men), and their mother, Lady Tremaine, hates Cindy for pretty much the same reasons. As the years passed Lady Tremaine began to squander the family fortunes in a stubborn but futile quest to improve/refine her awkward, unattractive daughters (to call them 'homely' would be an insult to homely people everywhere) while all three relegated Cinderella to being the multi-tasking servant of the house, abusing her, mistreating her and humiliating her every chance they get (they are particularly fond of increasing her already absurd workload). That brings us to Cinderella in the present, where she has blossomed into a good looking young lady who somehow manages to remain kind hearted and nice despite her abusive step family and holds on to the hope that one day the tables will turn in her favor. Cinderella gets her shot at freedom & happiness when a royal ball is held to introduce the local prince to an eligible young maiden so that he can take her as a wife, settle down, start a family, etc. Naturally, her step family tries to keep her from attending, even going so far as to physically assault her and rip up the dress she had procured for herself (with a little help from her mice friends - the dress belonged to her biological mother). Finally pushed beyond her breaking point, Cinderella runs out into the courtyard and cries in despair. It is at that point that her Fairy Godmother, a short, plump, jolly woman, arrives and provides Cinderella with transportation and a transformed dress (after all, Cinderella wouldn't make a very good impression at the ball if she entered the scene looking like she had just gotten gang raped). Cindy arrives at the ball, the Prince falls hard for her, but that pesky midnight rule gets in the way, forcing her to flee, but leaving behind a glass slipper. Make a long story short - after a long harrowing quest to find the mystery girl via trying on the glass slipper, Cinderella is found and she and the prince get married, giving her the happy ending she deserves.Overall, an enjoyable Disney classic. Not without its flaws, the most glaring of which is that the Prince is little more than a MacGuffin to help push the plot along - he has very little screen time and even less dialogue, so we never get to know him very well or get a good look at his relationship with Cinderella (which is unfortunate since, according to the making of documentary, the Prince was originally meant to play a bigger role), and a few additional scenes to help flesh out Cinderella herself might have been helpful (there was a song that showed her fantasizing of turning into an army of maids to clean up the house as well as eavesdropping on her step-family post ball to show her amusement at their jealousy, which was cut because Walt himself thought it made her look spiteful). Still, Cinderella herself is a likable enough heroine, even if she is upstaged by her mice friends, and there's a sweetness to the film that is becoming harder to find these days. Of course, if this were being made now, Cinderella would probably put up more of a struggle against her family during the dress ripping scene and would probably free herself in the climax (either by picking the lock herself or making an impractical yet exciting jump down from her window) but this is beside the point.And for all those who say Cinderella sets a bad example for young girls, well, consider this - at least Cinderella didn't go around getting publicly drunk and indecently exposed, unlike some modern day 'princesses' (you know who I mean).",8,1,1,6 September 2008
Rear Window," The Window at the Rear
","James Stewart, who must have been Hitchcock's leading man more than any other actor, rivaled only by Cary Grant, plays a wheelchair bound photographer who is having doubts about his relationship with lovely socialite Grace Kelly (who kind of looked like Nicole Kidman in her day) and who's only hobby at the moment is spying on his neighbor's during a heat wave. That's when he thinks he spots a murder, but is it for real or is his imagination running away with him?The only thing missing from this entry would have to be the dysfunctional relationship between a man and his mother. You've still got the creepy imagery, the 'nowhere to run, nowhere to hide' feeling, and the beautiful blond. I think James Stewart must have been liked by the audiences of his day on account of his being so unpolished (you know, his funny voice and what not), but he makes for a good confused hero and this makes for an entertaining suspense tale. That's future Perry Mason star Raymond Burr as the film's little seen villain, by the way.",8,1,3,9 April 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Great film, but where's Saruman?
","Contains Spoiler Picking up where the uneven 'Two Towers' left off, Frodo & Sam are still heading for Mordor and Mt. Doom to destroy the ring, but guide Golem is both a help and a hindrance. Aragorn, Gandalf, Ghimli and Legalos catch up with Merry & Pippin and they snatch up an orb that Pippin, being as stupid as he is, looks into, sees Sauron and tricks the evil lord that he's the ring bearer. This leads Gandalf to take Pippin to Gondor to talk to the steward, Lord Denethor, father of Boromir and Faramir, who is pretty much letting his kingdom get trampled into the Earth due to depression and will not let the rightful king, Aragorn, take the throne. Pippin and Gandalf signal Rohan anyway and King Theoden rallies his men to come to the rescue. Golem tricks Frodo into thinking Sam's his enemy and he sends Sam away while Faramir is sent off to die in battle against the orcs by his demented dad. Gandalf beats up the despairing Denethor and rallies the men to defend their city against the on coming orcs, led by a smarmy pale orc who later wets his pants when the Riders of Rohan show up and trample their forces. The Riders of Rohan are in turn trampled by a herd of monster elephants and their riders, but later rescued by Aragorn and his army of the undead, while Eowyn (Miranda Otto) slays the head honcho Nazgul, but alas, Theoden meets his end on the battle field. Frodo FINALLY figures out that Golem was playing him for a sap when the little monster traps him inside a cave where a giant monster spider tries to eat him. Frodo is later rescued by Sam and they continue the journey while Aragorn rallies the last of the armies of men to distract Sauron's forces. At the end, Frodo is corrupted by the ring and refuses to throw it in, and is attacked by Golem, who bites off his finger in order to get the ring back for himself and later falls into the lava, destroying the ring, Sauron, Mordor and himself. Even though Frodo treated him like dirt, Sam saves Frodo from falling into the lava and they are later rescued by Gandalf and the giant Eagles. Aragorn is made king, Arwen (Liv Tyler) becomes his queen, Eowyn hooks up with Faramir, Eomer becomes King of Rohan, Ghimli & Legalos finally admit that they're friends, the Hobbits return home, and Frodo later sails off to the undying lands with Bilbo and Gandalf while the others live mostly happily ever after in the Shire.
Okay, there were a few things I didn't like, even though this one is vastly superior to 'Two Towers'. They should have shown us what happened to Saruman (Christopher Lee) the main reprsentative of the forces of evil in the first two films, cut down on Arwen (I'm not a big Liv Tyler person anyway) and probably cut down on the battles and made the ending shorter while leaving in more room for things like Eowyn's relationship with Faramir and the grief of Eomer when he thinks his sister's dead. And alas, there's too much Golem here and not enough Treebeard.But the rest of the film is great. Beautiful locations, stunning CGI, and a solid cast. Bernard Hill and Miranda Otto deserved so much more publicity for their performances as King Theoden and Eowyn that it's a crime that they're both over shadowed by Liv Tyler, who I now believe was simply used as a battering ram to propel the marketing. David Wenham finally shows us Faramir's true sides through his dysfunctional relationship with his dad Sean Astin shines above all the other Hobbits - even Elijah Wood's Frodo - as Sam. Not that Wood doesn't deserve credit for his portrayal of Frodo. Ian McKellan and Viggo Mortensen are still good in their roles as well. Orlando Bloom is still little more than back ground scenery as Legalos, but he does have a cool kill on the monster elephant, and John Rhys Davies is better as Ghimli here than he was in 'Two Towers'. It's a shame that they cut out the scenes that would have developed Karl Urban's Eomer though.
But all in all, this is a grand film and deserves all the Oscar nods.",Null,0,1,12 April 2004
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," 'Whoa...'
","Despite the success of such films as 'Speed' and 'The Matrix' trilogy, to a lot of people, Keanu Reeves will ALWAYS be Ted, the taller, darker half of the Bill & Ted duo. And it would seem that Ted, of all Reeves many characters, is possibly the only one where he really seemed to have put himself into the role and felt like a natural.One of the great dopey dude slacker classics, the title characters Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (the aforementioned Reeves) are a pair of aspiring musicians, the Wild Stallions, who are in danger of being both separated if Ted can't pull up a good enough grade (which = military school) and flunking history class in general. But since they are destined to be 'the 2 Great Ones' who's music will unite the Earth and even alien races together in universal harmony, the most excellent dude Rufus (George Carlin) shows up and gives them a time traveling phone booth to help them pass their history class by bringing back real historical figures like Billy the Kid, Abraham Lincoln, Napoleon, Joan of Ark and what not. Now all they have to do is keep them from getting separated and jailed before they have to pass history! Along the way, Bill & Ted also fall in love with two sexy virgin princesses from the medieval circa.Yeah it's not great cinema, but it's a fun romp of slacker dude madness thanks to the energy and enthusiasm of Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves as the title characters.Followed by 'Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey'.",Null,56,69,22 April 2004

","Keanu Reeves is Neo, the hacker believed by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) to be the ass kicking Christ like figure who must save the world from the Matrix. To do so, he must battle the agents, one of whom is played by 'Lord of the Rings' Hugo Weaving. Carrie-Anne Moss is the woman Neo loves and is loved by, Trinity.The first entry was a mesmerizing, eye popping visual extravaganza that redefined science fiction and revitalized interest in the theme of man VS machine. 'The Matrix Reloaded' was mostly cobbled together faux philosophy that featured dialogue that made no sense, some engaging fight scenes and the chance to see Carrie-Anne Moss stripped of her clothing, leather garments and all (but like Sandra Bullock in 'Fire on the Amazon', you never see any of Carrie-Anne's private areas, you only see that her slender, 5'8 1/2' body is completely unclothed). 'The Matrix Revolutions' was just boring and repeatedly anti-climatic.Stick with the original, as it is a fairly entertaining romp that may not be as clever as it likes to think it is but doesn't require you to completely turn off your brain.

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," War of the Stars
","The one that started it all...Spunky Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) is captured by the evil, satanic bastard known as Darth Vader (body of British weight lifting champion David Prowse, also the same man who trained Christopher Reeve for 1978's 'Superman - the Movie'; voice of James Earl Jones) and exposed as a traitor to the evil empire that has enslaved the galaxy and is challenged by a heroic Rebellion. Two of Leia's robots, the hapless C-3P0 (Anthony Daniels) and the handy R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) escape the ship and crash land on the desert wasteland planet known as Tatioone. After being captured by Jawas (Hobbit like people who wear cloaks) and traded to a farmer known as Owen Lars, his wife Beru and their nephew Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill, the future voice of the Joker). Luke is a callow youth who would like nothing more than to leave Tatioone and find adventure in the universe, then he stumbles upon a message in R2 from Leia asking for the help of an Obi-Wan Kenobi, AKA: Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness). Luke doesn't know anyone named Obi-Wan Kenobi but he knows a strange old hermit man named Ben Kenobi but is unaware that Obi-Wan & Ben are the same man. When R2 sneaks off in the night, Luke and 3P0 chase him down in the day and are attacked by Sand People AKA: Tusken Raiders. When the Sand People try to raid Luke's hover-car, they are scared off by Ben Kenobi, who reveals himself to Luke to be Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke tells him that R2 claims to be his property and has a message for him. Obi-Wan checks out the message and we find out that he was once a great Jedi Knight and that he was a friend of Luke's father, the late Anakin Skywalker, who was also a great Jedi Knight but one who, as far as Luke knows died of mysterious circumstances; actually, according to Obi-Wan, Anakin was murdered by O's former pupil, 'a young Jedi named Darth Vader.' Luke, however, has yet to discover the horrible truth behind it all... well, Luke is later persuaded to help Obi-Wan and study the way of the Force, which is what gives a Jedi his power (it helps that the Imperial Storm Troopers mutilated his aunt and uncle while he was out). Luke, Obi-Wan and the robots head off to Mos Eisly space port where they join forces with rogue pilot Han Solo (Harrison Ford in the role that made him a star) and his wookie companion Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). Though they're supposed to go the planet of Alderaan, they are intercepted by the Death Star, a giant space station orb that blows planets up real good and was responsible for the destroying Alderaan before our heroes could get there. Once on board the Death Star, our heroes rescue Princess Leia and get into all sorts of hijinx that will change their lives forever. Obi-Wan is tragically killed in a duel with his former student, Darth Vader. In the rousing finale, Luke, Han and Chewbacca become big time heroes for destroying the Death Star. The adventure, however, is only beginning.Well acted, great special effects in both the original theatrical version and the over done special edition, the classic 'Star Wars' trilogy is a masterpiece that, for better or worse, helped usher in the age of the blockbuster. Well acted all around by Mark, Harry (as in Harrison Ford), Carrie, Alec and Peter Cushing (as the other villain), but Ford steals the show as Han Solo, the great Rapscallion of the Universe.'You're all clear kid now let's blow this thing and go home!' - Han Solo",10,4,5,9 June 2004
Fantastic Four," Not very fantastic at all
","Not all comic books translate well to the big screen, whether because the material is too complex or too offbeat or because the people handling it just don't know what to do with it or because the powers that be want something that isn't what the source material is at all. And sometimes a comic book movie franchise can start off well but end terribly - see the Superman and Batman films made circa 1978-1987 and 1989-1997 respectively. Meanwhile, 'Spawn', 'Steel' and 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' h ave not done too well.So far the X-Men and Spider-Man films, while not without their flaws and weak points, have been very successful and popular with both fans and critics, but other Marvel properties such as Captain America, Daredevil, Elektra, the Incredible Hulk and the Punisher, have only run the gamut from noble failure to complete steaming pile of dog crap. But surely the Fantastic Four should have been one of the more dud proof Marvel properties in the hit or miss summer business, and in a way, they were, for this 2005 film did well enough to be considered a hit and garner a sequel despite poor acting, poor plot, and poor direction from Tim Story. Exactly how this extremely bad adaptation of the superhero quartet that not only single handedly saved Marvel in the 1960s but pave the way for a string of heroes who, for better or worse, would go on to outshine and overshadow them in terms of sales and popularity became a hit is a mystery to me. While not as bad as 'Elektra' or 'Catwoman' (oh it hurts to even mention that one), the 2005 Fantastic Four is a failure on most levels (I can only imagine how bad the 1994 version was).Things that are wrong with the film? Well, first of all, the film's biggest weak link is Jessica Alba as Susan 'Sue' Storm, AKA: The Invisible Girl/Woman. Sue Storm is not an ugly, pasty looking Hispanic girl, she is a nice looking Caucasian woman who is at least 30 years old. Adding insult to injury is the fact that Alba is a very bad actress; she couldn't emote to save her life. Whenever she tries to sound tough or passionate or authoritative, she comes across as bland, hollow, dispassionate, and uninspired (it's like watching Natalie Portman in the Star Wars prequel trilogy). When Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon) is told he could have any woman in the world but indicates that Sue is very special, it's hard to understand exactly what it is about Sue that he finds so compelling or intriguing or worthy of his evil, twisted lust, since there isn't really much at the core of Sue in this uninspired film translation. And if you think I'm being mean, the British press described Alba's miscasting and poor characterization of Sue as a cross between a whiny, pushy bitch and a hollow lust object - but who in their right mind would find Alba even remotely attractive is beyond me. If they had to go under 30 to cast the Invisible Woman, with the intention of having the Invisible Woman be caught repeatedly with her clothes off, they could have at least hired an actress who was actually good looking, like Amy Smart, Ali Larter or Julia Stiles - Julia Stiles at least projects an Earthiness not seen in most actresses her age. One of the great leading ladies of comic books (alongside Wonder Woman, Lois Lane, Jean Grey and Storm), Sue Storm-Richards deserved better, and so did Ioan Gruffud's Mr. Fantastic.Alba's male co-stars, the aforementioned Ioan Gruffud as Mr. Fantastic/Reed Richards, Chris Evans as her younger brother Johnny Storm/Human Torch and Michael Chikilis as Ben Grimm/the Thing, fair much better than she does. Gruffud is an affable, absent minded Reed, but as with Dr. Doom, it's hard to imagine exactly what it is Reed sees in Alba's Sue. Evans does the cocky yet likable young guy thing as well as any other actor his age can. Michael Chikilis is easily the strongest of the four as the cranky, crotchety Thing. If only he'd have clobbered Tim Story...Julian McMahon, meanwhile, is a very poor Dr. Doom. McMahon's Doom is very hollow and empty, lacking the powerful presence, malice, charm and evil incarnate necessary to make Doom register as a threat. And this is Dr. Doom for crying out loud, one of the most famous Marvel villains out there! This guy is to the Fantastic Four what Magneto is to the X-Men, and also a rumored inspiration for Darth Vader of the Star Wars films! A few decent action sequences and a few genuinely funny moments aren't enough to elevate this thing above the garbage that it is. Tim Story, chosen with only the urban comedy 'Barbershop' as his standout credit, because the Marvel folk wanted to take a change of pace from the gritty, brooding superhero films that dominate so much of today's market, which I can appreciate, but it failed miserably because Story has no knack for subtlety or action sequences. The violence is mildly engaging but hardly exciting, especially since Story failed to properly flesh out the characters enough to make you care as to whether or not they'll survive and save humanity.Just skip it and stick with the comic books. Or even the 1994-1996 animated version.",1,15,28,26 February 2006
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," 'It's only a model.'
","Monty Python strikes again!King Arthur (Chapman) encounters a series of ridiculous obstacles while trying to recruit the Knights of the Round Table and then embark upon a heroic search for the Holy Grail, bestowed upon them by God, who it turns out hates people groveling, averting their eyes and apologizing. Along the way Arthur and the boys are plagued by taunting French guards, the Knights who say NI, sexy maidens, killer rabbits, the bridge of death and other oddities. A bit long and slow (feels longer than it actually is) and ends abruptly, but still very funny.Best gags - 1) The Coconut/Swallow guards.2) The constitutional peasants ('Help, help!! I'm being repressed!')3) Arthur VS The Black Knight ('The Black Knight always triumphs! Have at you!')4) Camelot ('Let's not go to Camelot. It is a silly place.')5) The Encounter with God ('Oh don't grovel! If there's one thing I can't stand it's groveling!')6) The Knights who say NI7) The Bridge of Death ('Well you have to know these things when you're king, you know.')'Could someone give me a bit of a push, please?' - John Cleese as Sir Lancelot hanging from a rope.",Null,2,4,24 September 2004
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'
","Luke studies under Yoda, fights Vader and learns the big horrible family secret (don't you just hate skeletons in the closet?). Han Solo & Princess Leia fall in love when not exchanging red hot love/hate barbs. And we also meet the man who previously owned the Millenium Falcon, Lando Calrissian.
Star warfare highlights include the battle on the ice planet of Hoth, the Millenium Falcon being chased through the asteroid field, a handful of shootouts, and of course, the duel between Luke and Vader. There's also some chilling suspense in the cave when the abominable snowman from outer space is either stalking Luke or mauling him or getting his arm severed. But the film also boasts stronger performances this time around in addition to the superior light saber duel. Mark Hamill's Luke may complain a lot but he manages to make the complaining believable and never tacky or annoying. Harrison Ford steals every scene he's in as Han Solo, and once again he is well matched by Carrie Fisher's distressing damsel Leia, who manages to argue with him in a believable manner. Even Vader himself seems to become more soulful here and not just a giant hulking half maimed machine man tyrant.Easily the best of the old trilogy.",10,0,1,9 April 2004
Sin City," While admittedly not my personal preference, this is definitely a knock out
","Visually stunning film adaptation of comic book scribe Frank Miller's 'Sin City' stories (which he actually co-directed at the insistence of Robert Rodriguez). Rather than focus on one character's storyline, the film chronicles the antics, shenanigans and misadventures of a handful of different characters, all of them noirish anti-heroes or anti-heroines who are as jaded and decidedly anti-social as they come. Among the story lines, Bruce Willis's aging cop suffers for trying to save an innocent little girl from a senator's child molesting son (Nick Stahl, who becomes the Yellow Bastard), that little girl grows up to be a stripper played by Jessica Alba who's in love with Willis's long suffering cop even though he's old enough to be her grandpa (in real life more like old enough to be her father but that's beside the point), Clive Owen's mystery man Dwight gets in trouble for helping hookers kill a cop (Del Toro) who was roughing up on his girlfriend (Brittany Murphy) which breaks an alliance code between cops and hookers, Mickey Rourke seeks revenge on the stoic yet effeminate cannibal who helped kill his would be girlfriend, and Josh Hartnett plays a potentially misogynistic kill.Shot in staggeringly beautiful black & white mimicking the comic book panels to an almost painfully accurate point and being just all around almost blatantly macho in its carefree more-the-merrier attitude, this film should please both Frank Miller fans and general action fans (though Alexis Bledel of 'Gilmore Girls' is hopelessly miscast as one of the hookers).",7,0,1,13 November 2007
Gangs of New York," When Daniel Day-Lewis gives a bad performance, you know you're in trouble
","The Plot - sort of a West Side Story for the post-Colonial age, with Irish immigrants fighting their 'native' oppressors. One of the ringleaders of the 'natives' is a ferocious, cantankerous, and most likely insane fellow with a glass eye known as William Cutting, AKA: Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis); based on a real person. Bill the Butcher kills the leader of an Irish gang called the Dead Rabbits, that leader being 'Priest' Vallon (Liam Neeson) during a gang fight. Years later, Vallon's son, Amsterdam (Leonardo Dicaprio) having achieved adulthood, seeks revenge on Bill (who hasn't aged a day), but first infiltrates Bill's gang and becomes a kind of student to him. Later Amsterdam gets involved with pretty thief Jenny (Cameron Diaz), who has a sordid, seedy past with Bill the Butcher. Love, lust, betrayal, the Draft Riots, chaos and mayhem ensues.In the end, the film is a mess. An ambitious, beautiful looking mess, but a mess all the same. Despite it's lofty dreams of examining the oft forgotten trouble of the time period and having the much beloved director Martin Scorsese at the helm, the film never really becomes cohesive and the characters are for the most part not all that likable or interesting. Perhaps the biggest disappointment is Daniel Day-Lewis, one of the most charismatic and engaging actors of his generation, but one whose film output is so sporadic that he was missing in action for five years before making this, his much hailed return to the cinematic screen. And, unfortunately, Day-Lewis gives a Razzie worthy performance. Whatever skill or passion or dedication he put into the character just doesn't transfer well to the screen. In the end, Day-Lewis, complete with an irritating accent, comes across as being little more than a one-note cartoon villain. I can only assume that the character looked better on paper. The film also wastes Liam Neeson, who appears only too briefly as the stalwart Irishman whose courage inspired all and impressed Bill. Perhaps a more engaging story could have been found in focusing on the conflict between Day-Lewis and Neeson, but alas, this was not to be.",4,2,8,20 July 2006
The Social Network," Compelling to a point but runs out of steam after a while
","Once upon a time a bright but apparently very socially inept young man named Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) became the youngest billionaire in the world pretty much by accident when he created Facebook, now the most popular & widely used social networking site available - and royally angered and/or back-stabbed a few people along the way. Among them were the Winklevoss twins (Armie Hammer with a body double), who hired him to help design a social network site for their school, his best friend Eduardo Savarin (Andrew Garfield) and Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), the founder of Napster whose personal & professional career was a series of spectacular highs and lows.Like any film based on a true story you have to wonder just how much of the dramatization on screen is true and how much of it is just that - drama. It's a compelling film to a point, but after a while I grew tired of the film's 'brilliant irony' that the founder of Facebook is - or may be - a hopelessly anti-social person, cruel and condescending to those who sees as intellectually inferior but unable to truly connect with anyone emotionally, and that will also depend on how well you can tolerate Jesse Eisenberg, one of many actors who probably won't transition well to leading man roles once it's clear he's too old for the 'more than a boy but not quite a man' niche, as the film's anti-heroic interpretation of Mark Zuckerberg. By the end of the film I found myself rooting for the Winklevoss twins to 'gut the little nerd', as they put it, even though they weren't that much better than Mark.As a trivia note, Zuckerberg actually had a steady girlfriend during the rise of Facebook so that alone may cause to question how accurate the film's depiction of him really is.",Null,0,2,25 October 2011
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Back to basics and bringing in the big Scottish guns
","After dissing East Indian culture and going with gore galore in 'Temple of Doom', Steven Spielberg and George Lucas went back to basics with 'The Last Crusade' and even brought in a Hollywood icon to boot. Like 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', Indy (Harrison Ford) must once again battle those pesky Nazis for a religious artifact, this time the Holy Grail, and thrown into the mix - along with Brody and Sallah - is Indy's adventure inexperienced dad, played by Sean Connery. Along the way, Indy even gets some character development, as we see how his dysfunctional relationship with his dad contributed to his personality.Ford and Connery are a great pair, and Alison Doody stands out as the only Jones girl who stabbed Indy in the back (and slept with both him and his dad). The late River Phoenix, the Leonardo Dicaprio of his day, also does serviceable work in the opening as the young Indy (may he rest in peace). My only real complaint is that the action seems to be on a smaller scale here, lacking the OOMPH of 'Raiders' and the crazed, frenzied, kinetic energy of 'Temple of Doom'. However, you have to love the scene with the tank.
Of them all, this may be the most friendly to children, excluding the fate of Walter Donovan. Enjoy!",10,1,1,16 December 2003
Back to the Future," It's all about being a man
","SPOILERS!! 'Back to the Future' underwent a lot of changes. In earlier drafts of the script, the time machine was not a car but more of a chamber or fridge, Marty's mom Lorraine was called Eileen, Doc's pet was a monkey named Shep isntead of a dog named Einstein, George became a boxer instead of a writer and Marty himself had to confront a few federal figures in order to get back to 1985 (originally 1982). But one idea always stayed the same - a son teaching his father how to be a man and get him to hook up with his mother even though the mother is infatuated with her own son or else he and his family won't exist! The film also presents the idea that happiness and manhood are linked.Because George McFly (Crispin Glover) is unable to stand up for himself, his life is an unhappy one: his house is full of bad furniture, his wife Lorraine (Leah Thompson) is a depressed beer guzzling chain smoker, his son Dave (Marc McClure, Jimmy Olsen of the Superman films) works at a McDonalds, hisdaughter Linda has problems with her love life and his younger son Marty (Michael J. Fox), a typical teenager who wants to be a rock star but has doubts about himself, is probably the best of the lot. Meanwhile, George's life long tormentor Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson: 'Say hi to your mom for me kid.') is his boss and still pawns off all his work on George, just like when they were in high school. George himself is a middle aged mess of a nerd, and because of this his family, particularly Marty and Lorraine, are unhappy with him.
The only good things Marty has going for him is his girlfriend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells) and his eccentric mad scientist pal 'Doc' Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd). While video taping Doc's plutonium powered time machine car, things go horribly awry and Marty is transported back to 1955, where he must get help from the 1955 Doc in order to get back to 1985. Unfortunately, Marty screws up his mother and father's first meeting as teenagers, which puts his own existence in danger because if they don't fall in love at the high school dance that was supposed to be their first big date, then he and his siblings won't exist!This gives Marty the unique chance to be his own dad's mentor and engages in a series of embarrassing attempts to get the beautiful Lorraine and hapless George together. Problem is George is too shy and clumsy to properly talk to people, least of a a beautiful girl like Lorraine, Biff Tannen is also after Lorraine and Lorraine herself is infatuated with her future son Marty! George manages to win Lorraine's sympathy but not her interest, and it doesn't help that Marty has a knack for upstaging his own father, if only to protect both of his parents from Biff. This makes Marty the film's definition of a man: a guy who can stand up for himself.Fortunately, Lorraine's infatuation with Marty eventually fizzles and Georgecomes through. When Biff tries to rape Lorraine in a car at the dance, George (as part of a failed plan concocted by Marty) comes to the rescue. The sight of Biff roughing up Lorraine finally angers George enough to fight back and he strikes Biff down with a mighty left hook, which also scores him big points with Lorraine. Striking down Biff is the first step George takes in achieving his manhood and he later cements it when a guy tries to steal Lorraine from him at the dance but he pushes the guy away.Because of this, George's life in the future is much happier: his house has better furniture, his wife Lorraine is healthier and happier, his son Dave has a better job, daughter Linda has control of her love life and Marty is basically the same except he now has a big truck and Biff no longer has any control over George. This is because George became a writer like he wanted to and is able to provide better for his family. This would imply that manhood and happiness are linked.Thomas Wilson is an imposing Biff, Fox is an endearing teen hero, and Leah Thompson is both repugnant and adorable as his mom Lorraine. The real standouts though are Christopher Lloyd as Doc and Crispin Glover as George.Though his intense gaze may be out of place at times, Glover brought something unique to George McFly that made him more than just another underdog. Who would have guessed he'd go on to play so many weird characters? Lloyd is just plain funny.The ending of the film, where Marty and Jennifer are whisked away to the future by Doc, was NOT a set up for a sequel, it was just another gag.",Null,1,2,20 April 2004
The Birds," Hitchcock's last true classic
","Tippi Hedren plays a blond with an unhappy past and Rod Taylor plays a small town lawyer who has thing for her. After he plays a small prank on her as retribution for a prank she pulled a few months earlier, she shows up in his town looking for him to return the favor. They begin a mild courtship after a bird attacks her and she gets to know his mother and sister (though Rod looks old enough to be her father). As time unfolds, the birds attack again and again, no rhyme or reason other than Miss Hedren is in town.Features the usual Hitchcock doses of suspense, dysfunctional relationships between a man and his mother, and a beautiful blond. Though Miss Hedren isn't quite as engaging as Eva Marie Saint or Grace Kelly, she's does alright (it was her first film after all). The mother is strangely sympathetic when compared to a few other Hitchcockian mothers.The little sister later appeared as Lambert in 'Alien'.This would be Hitchcock's last true classic, and last hit from a box office standpoint. While his subsequent films certainly had their interesting points (though TOPAZ was something of a low point for him), Hitch's craftsmanship would slowly begin to deteriorate and he never again quite achieved what he achieved here and/or what he achieved in his other earlier films. Essential viewing.",10,1,2,9 April 2004
Jurassic Park," 'But when the pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don't eat the tourists.'
","A grandfatherly mad man has created dinosaurs for his park. Dinosaur digging experts Sam Neil, his girlfriend Laura Dern, and math genius Jeff Goldblum are brought to the island to inspect the place. Naturally, everything that could possibly go wrong does go wrong and Sam is forced to lead two kids back to the safety of the main headquarters on the island.Followed by two inferior sequels - 'Lost World: Jurassic Park' which had Jeff, Jeff's girlfriend Julianne Moore and Jeff's adopted black daughter being towed around another island that was a breeding facility and 'JP 3' which had Sam Neil rescuing a hapless couple and their son from another island. Neither film was particularly good.JP 1, however, is a classic. The humans may take a backseat to the special effects, some of the best I've ever seen, but they do what they can to make you sympathize with them. Jeff is fun to watch as usual as a quirky genius. Too bad he's on his back for most of the film (and not in that sense either). Only real complaints are over length and some logic errors (like why the little boy doesn't try to get the gun to Sam and Laura when they're holding the door against the rapters).",8,1,2,7 April 2004
Evil Dead II," Groovey - Bruce Campbell's fight for life!
","Sequel/remake of 'Evil Dead' finds Bruce Campbell, one of cinema's most abused heroes, still battling those pesky demons, this time with the help of a hick, the hick's girlfriend, the daughter of the professor who unleashed the pesky demons, and the associate professor of the professor who unleashed the demons. Along the way Bruce exchanges his right hand for a chainsaw.I definitely liked this one better than the original, don't ask me why. Lots of stylized imagery and dark humor (severed hand gives former owner the finger) but no tree rape scenes. One of my personal favorite bits is the scene where all the objects in the cabin start laughing at Bruce.And remember, don't go out that door until after day light!Followed by 'Army of Darkness'.",8,2,3,2 June 2004
V for Vendetta," Neat film
","Based on the Alan Moore graphic novel, this is the tale of an apparently disfigured man made 'super human' individual known only as V (Hugo Weaving for the most part) who is now trying to get England to rage against the machine so to speak, as England is now living in a cast iron authoritarian state under the Nazi like rule of the John Hurt villain. Natalie Portman plays the requisite eye candy.True, the whole 'fight the power' thing has been perverted over the years to being sort of a fashion statement, therefore this is 'rage against the machine' made by the machine type product, whilst the very concept of rebelling against the evil dictator state has been done so many times that it's practically cliché, which is the film's real opponent much more than the Hurt character, but the film is still fun albeit weird. Weaving sounds like he's having a grand old time as V, playing him as a foppish trickster Zorro, and there's violence and style to spare, plus the 1812 Overture. Natalie Portman, however, was a little flat, and to be honest I'm not sure if she's just naturally flat, if she inherited some kind of Star Wars prequel syndrome or if she was just having trouble holding the British accent.",7,0,2,6 April 2006
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Where Art Thou, O Brother?
","Chain gang prisoners George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro escape and proceed to George's old home because he says he's got gold hidden there from when he knocked over an armored car, which is why he was sent to jail in the first place. Along the way, they encounter a blind black rail road man with no name and a prophecy about their future, a back stabbing relative of John's, a crazy gun toting thug by name of George 'Baby Face' Nelson, three hot 'Sirens' who get the boys drunk and haul John off to be tortured by the guys who are chasing them in return for George & Tim's whereabouts, a 'Cyclops' played by John Goodman, and they even become known for a hit country song under the band name 'The Soggy Bottom Boys'! We also find out that George's wife is about to get married to another man and that she told their daughters that George died when he got hit by a train and the guy she's marrying is campaign manager to an ambitious racist politician who's also the member of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). Then George reveals that there is no gold and there was no armored truck: 'I got sent up for practicing law without a license.' says George. He lied to them about the gold because he needed their help to escape because he wanted to get back to his wife and children and now must thwart the man trying to steal his family away from him. After rescuing their black guitar player Tommy from the KKK, they show up at a campaign show and play their song 'Man of Constant Sorrow' and accidentally expose the ambitious politician as a Klansman. This earns them the gratitude of the town's current mayor and he pardons them of all previous crimes. Then George takes the boys to his old home because his wife won't patch things up with him until he finds their old wedding rings, but there they are found by the chain gang cops, one of them a man constantly wearing sunglasses, and they overlook what the mayor said about them and try to hang them, but after praying to God for a miracle, George and the gang are saved by the valley being flooded. They even see a cow on top of a farm roof!Allegedly based on 'The Odyssey' by Homer.Personally I don't think the Coen are all that funny; critics are always raving about what masters they are of screwball comedy, but personally I see nothing screwy in their comedy. This film, however, is reasonably entertaining and gives George Clooney a better outlet for his dry, deadpan humor. The best line without doubt -'They loved him up and turned him into a horny toad!'",Null,0,1,23 April 2004
