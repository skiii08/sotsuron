The Ring," My Review
","Every now and then a movie comes along that blows you away, and leaves you with much thought, and astounds you with its unpredictability.  This is one of those movies.The fact that makes the film so much more psychological is that it is set along the lines of an Urban Legend/Ghost Story, and the horror is something you can't exactly see.The film itself is full of dismal dark and dingy atmosphere, and the kind of plotline that keeps you glued to the seat (perhaps though sitting right at the edge of it).While the movie leaves you in much confusion, as it slowly progresses it begins to all come together at the end and make sense (much as most movies do), don't let your confusion deter you from watching it right to the end, it's worth it for the finale.",Null,0,0,23 February 2003
