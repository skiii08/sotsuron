The Blair Witch Project," For the love of God, save your money!
","My fiance' and I, like many others, were very excited to see this film. We, like quite a few others, were greatly disappointed.  The film was boring and not even remotely scary.  The majority of the film is during the daylight hours when they're just walking through the woods and the parts shot at night are filled with nothing more than twigs, leaves, screaming, and 'scary voices/noises' that you can't hear but supposedly the actors can.  To top the pathetic theater experience off, the shaky camera work caused such motion sickness that I had to leave the movie towards the end and vomit 5 times in the movie theater bathroom.  I don't think ANY movie should cause you to toss your cookies because of the 'cinematography'... and I use that term loosely in this case.  According to my fiance' I didn't miss much. My advice... save your money and if you still really want to see it... rent it so you can spend your time vomiting in the privacy of your own bathroom.",1,1,2,10 August 1999
