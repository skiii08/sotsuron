Requiem for a Dream," Brilliant... Dark, Gloomy, Depressing but Beautiful
","'Requiem for a Dream' is genuinely one of the best movies I have ever seen - and I am a BIG film buff (or consider myself to be). Although this movie is arty, which I usually hate in a movie, it is used brilliantly well in this movie, and Darren Aronofsky's directing is second to none. The acting is fantastic, and realistic, and the story may seem predictable of a drug movie at first (don't do them, they mess you up type of thing), but it really is an amazing movie, exceeding all my expectations. Another thing that made me love this film - and I suppose - equally loathe it, was that it was heart-wrenchingly sad. Not only did I cry, I screamed! Sounds corny, but so true, the ending pained me very much (I won't give away any more than that), but it really hurt. This movie packs a serious punch, and I hope you can fall in love with it as much as I did.",10,0,1,1 October 2012
