Blade Runner 2049," 2 reasons why you should watch this movie
","There are only two reasons for people who have not watched the original Blade runner to watch this movie: 1.If you love Ryan Gosling enough to sit through this 3 hours film and watch his dumb and emotionless face play through this dull and slow plot. 2.If you hate Ryan Gosling enough that you would sit through this 3 hours film and watch him get slapped and hit by different characters multiple times really really violently. This is the worst film I've seen in years. The only reason I did not leave the cinema in the middle of this movie is because I usually give film the benefit of the doubt, because you never know when the plot twist comes. And, oh, believe me, you don't know how I much I regret this decision. When the 'plot twist'came (which is pretty much at the end of this 3 hour movie), I have already decided what a waste of time it was to watch this movie, so I did not care one bit about it. The director Denis Villeneuve tries to make his films 'brainy' and 'confusingly intelligent' like those directed by the great director Christopher Nolan. The cinematography of the two directors's films are stunning, however Villeneuve's film can only be described as confusing, dull and stupid. They are so focused on the CGI, that they forgot to hire a screenwriter ClichÃ© and boring storyline filled with unnecessary violence and disgusting bugs. Nowadays, CGI can no longer satisfy and fool us, you can't hide a horrible storyline behind specials effects, IT JUST WON'T WORK ANYMORE. A waste of time to watch this movie, cannot believe I had to sit through that. Even Harrison Ford can't save this movie, just let it die.",2,9,17,27 October 2017
