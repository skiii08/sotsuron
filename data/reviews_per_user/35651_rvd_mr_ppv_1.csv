Iron Man 3," Shane Black IS TERRIBLE! How could you Kevin Feige & Marvel Studios?!!!!!
","Iron Man 3 is good, BUT, the twist was absolutely stupid & diabolical IMO. Not sure how many of you here posting are comic book readers, but the twist was a joke & I think deflated the movie a little.*SPOILERS AHEAD!* They had already changed the origin of The Mandarin so that they could fit him / incorporate him into the movie, which is fair enough for not wanting to P*ss off the Chinese or feel they were portraying a racist caricature, BUT, the awesome concept they did come up with for their interpretation / adaptation of The Mandarin & getting an awesome actor like Kingsley just seems to be a big waste of time after the reveal / twist.Kinglsey's Mandarin when he was playing it seriously & not being 'Trevor the actor' was absolute gold & would have been a brilliant recurring / returning foe for Iron Man again or even a destructive threat against The Avengers.Kingsley's Mandarin teaming up with Thanos, Red Skull or Cross Bones etc in future would have been pretty cool to see.I just think at the end of the day, Shane Black's twist was an absolute joke & big waste of time to the movie over all & let it down just a little bit & basically, when you think about it, there was 'No Mandarin'. Aldrich Killian saying he is / was the real Mandarin just doesn't cut it for me & is an utter cheap cop out to try & combine the two as one, VERY LAZY WAY OUT! I hope if there is anymore Iron Man films that another director or maybes even Joss Whedon himself should he ever want to use a 'real' / proper type Mandarin in an Avengers movie can retcon the travesty that Shane Black delivered.Also, not enough RDJ or Don Cheadle in their respective armours throughout for me.However, the scene near the end during the big battle where Tony calls on all the suits of armour was incredible & literally gave me chills up my Back watching that, great scene.Now, I may get some criticism or hate here, but, IMO, for all of it's so called flaws people seem to say it had or being too crammed etc, I still think Iron Man 2 was better than 3, just a shame that Whiplash was wasted & didn't come across as enough of a threat in it.That's Iron Man 2 & 3 that have had pretty weak villains & 3 not even really having Iron Man's biggest comic book villain for over 50 years even in it.I'd give Iron Man 3 a 7/10, wasn't perfect, but it was good / just above good.Hopefully something comes out of all the A.I.M talk / mentions as I'd like to see M.O.D.O.K on the big screen, but I've just heard recently that there is some sort of rights issue with the character which would be a bit unfortunate after alluding to A.I.M in Iron Man 3.Another thing that bugged me. The MARKETING. When you watch & see the trailers, they are selling this movie with the Mandarin character & as a serious tone, which, maybe this is a bit of an exaggeration / OTT comment, but, I'd see that as FALSE ADVERTISING on the marketing part.Because you get a completely different outcome from what they're pushing in the trailers & to me, this movie is somewhat comedic at times when it shouldn't be and takes away from the seriousness they also push in the trailers. But then again, Black can never seem to get away from his Lethal Weapon roots! Maybe if they had have reversed the way the twist was used, & made Killian portray himself as the 'Fake Mandarin' & the reveal was Kingsley as the 'Real Mandarin' that would have been so much better & actually would have worked over all.I've heard some people say after Joss Whedon has done Avengers 2 & 3, maybes have Shane Black helm one or two Avenger's after Joss has done his 3, personally, I don't want Shane Black anywhere near an Avenger's movie or even another Marvel movie / franchise after the debacle he went with here.I'd hate to have seen what Black would have done with Fin Fang Foom as he had apparently toyed around with the idea of putting him in Iron Man 3, would we have even gotten a Dragon?! LOL.NOTE TO MARVEL.......... Please keep Shane Black away from any future Iron Man film or any other Marvel property / Character, I just don't think he gets or understands the comic book genre at all & is too stuck in his own ways. This SHOULD have been a IRON MAN movie, NOT a KISS KISS, BANG BANG / LETHAL WEAPON COMBO!!!!!How Kevin Feige or Marvel Studios let this film get Green lit from its script is beyond me!!!!! Shame on you Feige!!!!!",7,2,4,30 April 2013
