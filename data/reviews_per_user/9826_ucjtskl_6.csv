First Man," Very Watchable Movie - Shame about the rushed ending
","First Man held my attention from start to finish - always a good sign - but the final scenes from leaving the moon to isolation periods were rushed, and hugely disappointing - putting two men on the moon was one thing - getting them back quite another - a missed opportunity to make the film an all around great watch.One might instead want to argue that the movie was about Neil Armstrong the person. This makes for a difficult topic because reports have it that Armstrong was chosen to be first man on the moon because of his introversion and lacking in external ego which makes for a challenging script - but raises interesting questions - the choice of Buzz Aldrin as partner was influenced by Neil Armstrong 
Jim Lovell - why was this - what was their relationship? The movie places more focus on the Apollo 1 astronaughts and Mrs Armstrong so we never really get to find out much about the relationships across the three folk riding Apollo 11 - shame.",7,1,3,14 October 2018
Gravity," A film worse than worse than Terrible
",Some spoilers included.Good visual effects but predictable and over-rated as a film. How this film won as many Oscars as it did is beyond me. Didn't see the film in 3-D but hey ho I must be old school: I like a story with good acting. Not a patch on Apollo 13 - Mr Clooney plays the one character that he seems able to do : over confident & vein - which is fine in almost any other movie but this one.Sandra Bullock oscillates between hysteria and nostalgia - not really very space like at all. The very idea that one could randomly push buttons to eject a Chinese landing module and arrive safely on earth was just silly. Not sure I would have acted any differently myself in the same situation mind you.Somewhat dismayed that I am obliged to write 10 lines on this movie in order to post a review - because I would have thought the title of this review was enough.,1,4,7,22 August 2014
Lost in Translation," Boring
","Wasted an hour or so waiting for something but nothing appeared. Am wondering how this film received its Oscar: 2003 must have been a pretty shoddy year for movies. Watching two people hardly speak, and when they do in monotones - makes for even less interest. Most memorable moment from the film was a two minute shave plus phone call giving notification of a FaX arriving. 'Put in under the door'. End of scene. Spent the next 10 minutes pondering why the scene was shot then gave up.One problem with movies that portray 'true life' is that those lives are often uninteresting. Perhaps I should give myself an Oscar for the humdrum three of four weeks I've just lived - or - maybe the point of a boring film is to self reflect to makes one's own life less boring. I know, I'll go to the pictures to have some entertainment - that will make a change - but only so long as I don't go to see this movie!",1,3,7,5 August 2009
American Hustle," Reasonable
","A fair movie working on the template of Goodfellers but without the violence or tension. Acting was reasonable, although many of the characters are slightly cardboard in their presentation. There is a twist at the end but to be honest, it was neither a surprise nor a shock - it was just the way it was - which is a testament to the movie's ability to engage.I liked the story - but as a film it missed something - which was disappointing. A film to watch but not rave about. 70's moments really didn't fit in - one might have expected Travolta to jump in and add some character to the scenes. I'm guessing the make believe testosterone scenes of lust were supposed to capture one - but it didn't work for me.The character I really liked was Jennifer Lawrence who I thought played her role exceptionally well.",5,0,1,23 October 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man," The movie still has 50 minutes to go on the TV
","I'm guessing that I am not the only one who finds IMDb ratings strange- 7.1 with so many negative posts? No-way - this undermines the IMDb brand.Thoroughly enjoyed the first 3 Spidey movies - but when I saw the fourth come out as a revamp of Spidey 1 - the question was why - especially given the recent Batman, Superman revamps which were atrocious.This movie follows suit as a terrible flop - Spidey is supposed to have a touch of humour about him - but really - shooting a web to the mouth to shut a criminal up? A sarcastic ha ha first time - second time Zzzzzz even if it was the lizard.Cardboard script, cardboard acting but at least there are only 37 minutes left ..... and what happened or is happening?Don't care.",1,4,16,30 May 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," No need for Spoilers - This one Spoils Batman.
","Without doubt the worst Batman Movie that I have seen.The plot: Confusing and out of sync - a rehash of another Hollywood Blockbuster that I enjoyed but whose title I forget. A city held to ransom by a fusion bomb that might go orf - tick tick tick.The characters: Batman looks past it - badly beaten up - and then manages to come back to full form not once .. but twice (Yawn). The villain Bain you would imagine to be the main man - but low and behold the real villain is his side kick who has little to do with the plot, whats going on etc etc etc - kind of thing I would expect from a Harry Potter story rather than Batman.Batman locked in jail - police underground - Batman has a way of escaping and does so from a broken position (Yawn Yawn Yawn).Can we get back to basics here with the Penguin, Joker, The mad Hatter, The Riddler, The Scarecrow etc etc etc. as drawn in the original comic scripts.ANDWhere was Robin? Batman without Robin is like Ollie without Hardy",1,10,16,24 August 2014
