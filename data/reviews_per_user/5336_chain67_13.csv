Scarface," Excessively Brilliant
","Brian De Palma's remake of the 1932 classic 'Scarface' nearly drowns in excess at times, but flourishes from it at other times. None of this is surprising considering Oliver Stone wrote the script. But this movie has to also be considered one of the bravest films of all time.   I won't say much about the plot which is pretty standard when it comes to gangster movies. It's about cuban refugee Tony Montana's(Al Pacino) rise and fall in the drug world. Eventhough other characters come and go, notably wife Elvira(Michelle Pfeiffer), best friend Manny(Steven Bauer), boss Frank Lopez(Robert Loggia) and sister Gina(Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, this is basically Montana's/Pacino's show.   In 'Scarface', Al Pacino is at his over-the-top best as Montana. Whether he's burying his face into a pile of coke, shooting someone point blank in the head or refusing to kill two small children Montana always seems like a real, deep character. He's a ruthless business man and killer, but he also has an honour code, He'll become a drug addict as long as his sister doesn't ect. But what really makes this film work is how visibly Monatana evolves from a young hothead looking to get rich, to a burnt out, paranoid addict who has it all and wants even more.    I have heard a lot of arguments as to whether 'Scarface' belongs in the company of 'The Godfather' and other gangster classics. Well in my opinion it does. If not for being very original or deep, but for having enough balls to go further than any other gangster movie, plus for having one of the most brutal antihero/villains in history. Oh yah and don't forget it's 206 uses of the F-word third mot in history(After Pulp Fiction and what I consider the best gangster movie of all Goodfellas). Great study in excess and brutality. 9/10",10,0,0,12 May 2001
Se7en," A MOODY IF NOT POWERFUL THRILLER
","Se7en is a very disturbing but entertaining film. David Fincher (The Game, Fight Club) moves things along slowly and powerfully in this tale of a young and cocky detective played excellently by Brad Pitt (Kalifornia, Fight Club) who is teamed with an old veteran who is about to retire played brilliantly by Morgan Freeman (The Shawshank Redemption, Unforgiven) and the serial killer who's identity I will not reveal is played with shocking brilliance by an actor I will not name. Overall a very dark but interesting thriller. 8.5 out of 10",Null,0,0,22 April 2000
L.A. Confidential," A Masterfully Spun Web of Corruption
","'L.A. Confidential' is one of the most masterfully spun conspiracy movies in history of cinema. It's also one of the darkest and most violent film noir's i've ever seen. But none of that will matter as you watch because all you'll be able to think about is how the three main police officers can uncover the web and not get killed in the process.   The three main police officers in question are Jack Vincennes(Kevin Spacey, The Usual Suspects), Bud White(Russell Crowe, Gladiator) and    Ed Exley(Guy Pearce, Ravenous). Jack is a hollywood cop. He lives for his role as technical advisor on the Dragnet-like show Badge of Honor. He also gets payed by journalist Sid Hudgeons(Danny DeVito, Twins) to give Sid info on busts of celebrities. Bud White is a thug of a cop. He lives to beat confessions out of suspects and to punish woman beaters. Ed Exley is a politician cop. He lives to rise in the ranks of the LAPD and doesn't even care if the whole station despises him.   Add to the mix Captain Dudley Smith(James Cromwell, Babe), callgirl Lynn Bracket(Kim Basinger, The Marrying Man), pornographer Pierce Patchett(David Strathairn, The Firm) and dirty District Attorney Ellis Loew(Ron Rifkin, The Negotiator) and you have a web of corruption, cops, porn and Los Angeles that makes for the most entertaining and best movie of 1997.
   This is the movie which should of swept the 1997 oscars not Titanic. Overall L.A. Confidential is the bets movie about L.A since Chinatown and deserves to be seen. 10/10",10,4,7,18 February 2001
Sleepy Hollow," One of Burton's Best
","If you like dark,deranged and creepy movies this is the jackpot. It's exactly what you'd expect from seemingly disturbed but brilliant Tim Burton of Batman and Edward Scissorhands fame. A very dark, stylish and bloody movie. This movie is not for the weak at heart. It has a lot of blood,gore, brutal violence and heads getting very graphically chopped off. Overall a good enough movie. 8/10",Null,0,0,26 November 1999
Snatch," Bullets, Blood, Laughs and Dogs
","As I said in my opening line this movie has a bit of everything, well only one dog actually but its as funny as 50 can be. Guy Ritchie's 'Snatch' is one of the craziest movies I have seen in my life. Every laugh is genuine, every twist and turn is unexpected and every one of the 20 - 30 characters in the movies has atleast one moment to shine. This movie is very reminiscent of Pulp Fiction in the way that everything happens unexpectedly, a bunch of stories interwind and gruesome violence is actually hilarious.  To fully figure out the plot to 'Snatch' it'll take 3 or 4 viewings atleast, but from one I figured this out. Frankie Four Fingers(Benicio Del Toro) steals an 84 Carat diamond the size of a golf ball from Antwerp. He goes to London where his gun dealer Boris the Blade(Rade Serbedzjia) betrays him hiring a pair of pawn brokers(Robbie Gee, Lenny James) and their driver(Ade) to steal it off Franky. When Franky disappears his boss Cousin Avi(Dennis Farina), the one to who the diamond was headed, comes to London and hires thug Bullet Tooth Tony(Vinnie Jones) to find Franky. While Turkish(Jason Stratham) and Tommy(Stephen Graham) are staging an illegal boxing in which their fighter must go down to the fighter selected by notorious gangster Brick Top(Alan Ford) but when Mickey O' Neil(Brad Pitt) knocks Turkish and Tommy's fighter out they have to convince Mickey to fight. He does but instead of taking a dive knocks his opponent out in one punch. Then it gets complicated.  The acting in 'Snatch' is top notch with every actor turning in a great performance. Eventhough it's extremely hard to pick a main character in 'Snatch' I'd have to say Turkish gets the most screentime barely edging out Mickey and Avi. Jason Stratham plays Turkish with ease and makes him a very fun character. The only reason I chose Turkish as the character with the most screentime is because also the narrator and describes all the other characters. But the actor who stands out most is Brad Pitt. He is hilarious as the gypsey boxer who as we later find out is probably the smartest character in the movie. His accent is so thick even the other characters don't know what he's saying.  Personally I found 'Snatch' a number of notches better than the extremely overrated 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' and as one of the most purely entertaining films I have ever seen. 'Snatch' is the freshest movie if the year and also one of the funniest. Great Movie. I give it 9/10.",9,0,1,20 January 2001
American Psycho," Very Smooth but gory thriller
","American Psycho is a classic in it's own mind. Yes some people like myself might enjoy it, some people will be disgusted by it and some people will hail it as a masterpiece, but overall this is just a very smooth, stylish and entertaining bloodbath.   But for a bloodbath with a lot of nudity American Psycho has a coherent story, excellent acting and a chilling if not satisfying conclusion. Give 90% of this movies credit to Christian Bale who is excellent as Patrick Bateman the very cool, handsome and smooth wallstreet trader who by night kills for fun.    The novel could of been translated better had Mary Harron not tried so hard to avoid an NC-17 and cut many scenes. Willem Dafoe gets quite annoying at times as the detective on Bateman's trail and Jared Leto is perfectly cast as smooth trader Paul Allen who has a nicer business card than Bateman. Witherspoon is average as Bateman's fiance Evelyn.    This movie won't please horror fans as much as it will please fans of smooth, entertaining thrillers. Overall 9 out of 10",8,0,1,22 April 2000
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," UNBELIEVABLE
","This is the best movie i have ever seen. First off it's the first action movie i've seen in a long time that has a plot as good as any drama or comedy. Second off the main spectacular things about T2 are the special effects, unbelievable, especially the part where the T-1000 morphs out of the floor and into the shape of the cop. Third is the acting which is excellent. Especially Linda Hamilton's super performance as Sarah Connor. Sarah is not insane, but also not exactly sane either. It a brilliant performance to pull that off and Hamilton pulls it off perfectly. Great Movie 10/10",10,2,2,30 December 1999
The Patriot," Patriotism at its Highest Level
","'The Patriot' is another in the long line of patriotic summer movies, with recent examples being Independence Day and Armageddon. But unlike those two other pro-US patriotic movies, 'The Patriot' is excellent. Eventough it's mostly the same point as the other patriotic movies, the United States can prevail over anything, this benefits from great performances by two Aussie's.    The two Aussie's in question are Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger. Gibson puts in a performance which stands as some of his best work, while Ledger(in his first major role) proves he can hold his own with even the best actors. All the other actors in this movies acquit themselves quite well. Led by a scary performance from Jason Isaacs as the main villain. Tcheky Karyou proves that with the right material he can also be excellent.  The plot is based on the Civil War and eventhough the main character and most of the other characters are all made up the story stays loyal to the source. One thing this movie does well is put in a right mix of action and drama. At some points I was nearly crying and at others I actually stood up and cheered. The character of Benjamin Martin(Gibson) is very intelligently written, while his Gabriel(Ledger) is at times under-written but comes off very convincingly. The only character that I didn't specifically like was that Colonel William Tavington(Isaacs). Eventhough the movie made me hate the character like it was supposed to, Tavington was just a bit too cartoonish in his evilness and it was hard to believe that he was a real person.  But overall 'The Patriot' overcomes it's small flaws and becomes one of the best films of the year. I highly recomend 'The Patriot' 9/10",Null,0,1,24 February 2001
Mission: Impossible II," Top Notch Thriller
","Mission Impossible 2 is by far the best pure action sequel to come out in many years. What makes M:I-2 so good is are the action sequences which couldn't be possible without the excellent direction of John Woo. Woo makes the most out of every scene, trying to squeeze every possible inch out of each scene. Tom Cruise puts on a good performance as IMF agent Ethan Hunt. Ving Rhames in top notch as Luther Stickell. Rhames surprisingly gets the best lines in the movie. Thandie Newton is also very enticing as Cruises partner and love interest. But the main acting asset of this film is Dougray Scott as the main villain Sean Ambroce. Scott's performance is interesting and riveting. Surprisingly M:I-2 has a pretty decent plot which never gets slow or uninteresting. So if your looking for a pure adrenaline rush or a top notch thriller see Mission Impossible 2. 9/10 Excellent Thriller",9,1,1,25 May 2000
Reservoir Dogs," A brutally brilliant film
","If you ask most people they'll say that Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece is Pulp Fiction. But a few years earlier Tarantino made this excellent look at a jewel heist gone bad. The acting is superb and the plot is nearly perfect. Let's start with the acting. The performances are mesmerizing especially Michael Madsen's brutal portrayal of Mr. White. Steve Buscemi (one of the most underrated actors in hollywood) almost makes us cheer for Mr. Pink and Tim Roth makes Mr. Orange his personal character.If you like action movies, heist movies, suspense movies of just want an entertaining film rent Reservoir Dogs. 9 out of 10",9,0,1,22 April 2000
Mystic River," Mystic River is a Sean Penn & Clint eastwood tour de force
","Mystic River Director: Clint Eastwood Jimmy: Sean Penn Dave: Tim Robbins Sean: Kevin BaconYou know it took a while, a long while. The first three quarters of this year produced very few movies that rose above 'entertaining'. Hell going into October there were only three movies I had seen which I would qualify as great, Phone Booth, X2 and Dirty Pretty Things(T3 came close). Then came Kill Bill. It blew everything away and was my lock for movie of the year...that lock lasted an entire week. Mystic River is THE best picture of 2003 so far. Better than Lost in Translation, better than Th13teen, better than Phone Booth and, yes, better than Kill Bill.Mystic River takes you on an emotional ride through a small neighborhood and a murder which brings very ugly memories, and even uglier futures. I won't go over the plot, cause really it's pointless. Plus I don't wnat to spoil anything although it really doens't matter. This aint about a big twist ending or a big shoot-out ending, Mystic River's ending is just another step in life and it's heart wrenching getting there.I must first commend the great Clint Eastwood(one of the most underrated movie makes of our time IMO). This movie features no quick cuts or camera tricks. No special effects or action set pieces. It features realism(and soemtimes graphic realism), it features real characters gonig through troubles and trying to find real solutions. Eastwood has a sure hand in all this and stages the film perfectly. Not one shot is wasted and it is all Eastwood's vision, all the way down to the beautiful score.The acting, just by the actors names, you know is good. But I never expected it to be this good. Sean Penn wins the Oscar already with his performance. If he is not rewarded with the best actor statuette it's ultimate proof of the Academy's bias and BS. Penn is gut wrenchingly powerful in the early part of the film but in other parts is coldly sadistic but with a reason and thus even in his more sadistic scenes there is a sense of truth and tragedy towards Jimmy, making this Penn's greatest performance of his great career.Tim Robbins puts in, arguably although only Shawshank comes close, the best performance of his career as his lack of emotional range fits perfect for Dave's traumatic state. Laura Linney, Marci Gay Harden, Laurence Fishburne and Kevin Bacon provide ample support to the leads making this the best ensemble cast of the year.Overall there isn't much to say about Mystic River except this will move you and it will make you feel. It could possibly be classified a Shakesperean tragedy rewritten in modern time. The guilt, the revenge, the inner struggle it's all there. The acting is the best of any movie this year. But in the end this is Clint Eastwood's movie and, as he always does, Eastwood 'makes our day' by making the best picture of 2003.****3/4(out of 5*)",10,2,4,19 October 2003
The Shawshank Redemption," Brilliant Masterpiece
","'The Shawshank Redemption' is without a doubt one of the best films of the 90's and one of the best prison dramas of all time.   'The Shawshank Redemption' can go head to head with any great movie of the 90's and probably win. The plot is airtight with only one or two mistakes through the whole film, not a lot of films could say the with even the likes of Forrest Gump, Titanic and Unforgiven have mistakes in them. One thing that Darabont does better than any director i've seen in a long time is pace every scene perfectly.  Another great thing about this film is the pitch perfect cast. Tim Robbins puts in the best performance of his career, even topping his role in 'The Player' and Morgan Freeman is outstanding as 'Red' Redding and old tymer who knows everything and has seen everything about jail. Bob Gunton is also brilliant as the evil sheriff putting in his best performance. But the most underrated performance in my opinion is the one put in by James Whitmore as 'Brooks'.  Eventhough 'The Shawshank Redemption' may seem like a tear jerker or like a tragic drama by the end you will have a smile on your face . I won't ruin it for you but the ending is one of the best I have ever seen, only rivaled by the unexpected twist in 'The Usual Suspects'. So if you want to feel some emotion, be surprised and enlightened or just plainly watch a great movie rent 'The Shawshank Redemption'. 10/10 Near Perfect Movie",10,0,0,12 January 2001
The Truman Show," Brilliantly Original
","'The Truman Show' is one of the most original, captivating and entertaining comedy-drama's i've ever seen. This movie is very different from any other movie i've ever seen. Eventhough in plot it's not extremely deep, it has an excellent premise which is more than a twilight zone rip-off.   One of the things that sets this movie apart from other alternate reality movies(edTV, Pleasantville)is the exquisite acting. Led by the pitch-perfect performance from Jim Carrey this movie has a great mix of excellent character actors. But like I said it is all fueled by Jim Carrey's brilliant Golden Globe© winning performance as Truman Burbank, a man whose life is on television 24/7. It is still beyond how he didn't even get nominated for an oscar when his performance was by far the best of that year. The other oscar worthy performance comes from the great Ed Harris(The Abyss, The Rock). Unlike Carrey, Harris did get nominated for an Academy Award©(He lost to James Coburn).   When you put all that together, along with the brilliant direction of Peter Weir, and you not only the best movie of 1998 but also one of the best movies of the 90's. See this movie. 10/10",10,2,4,12 February 2001
