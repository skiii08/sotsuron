Angels & Demons," Solid Thriller
","With all do respect to all those who read the book and tried to compare it with the movie,I never read the book but i just came from the premiere night here..and i have to say..I was WOWed !Why all the negative reviews and the disappointed moods ?This is a stay on the edge of a seat kinda flick,which guarantees great viewing and a heck of a good time.there is no dull moments on this one that's for sure.I have to say in my opinion that it exceeds TDC,with Ewan Mcgregor who totally stood out next to Tom Hanks,but don't get me wrong..all cast was well put and up to the task..I'm just pointing to an outstanding performance by Ewan Mcgregor.Tom hanks is Tom Hanks,it seems like he is Prof Langdon after all..no one can do it better than him.Ron Howard on the director seat however did an amazing job that exceeds his previous work in TDC .Anyways..go see it..and don't be fired down by the negative reviews.. total summer blockbuster.Bravo",9,14,25,13 May 2009
Star Trek," Now that's what Icall a Star Trek adventure !
","This was the first Star Trec flick to experience on a big screen as I was too little when the original ones were released. I have always been a fan of the franchise..but this..is totally different !That JJ Abrahams Movie,was worth waiting for and worth all the anticipation it harvested.A true Sci-Fi gem that didn't wipe out the authenticity of the original series,but opened a totally new door to a bunch of another star trek adventures.Well acted, well shot( incredible CGI ), well directed.No dull moments,loads of action,decent storyline...what's not to like !total summer blockbuster.Bravo",10,5,15,17 May 2009
Transformers," That was worth waiting ..
","3pm in the afternoon..and i'm waiting in a long line to get a ticket to the 10pm show for Thursday night..but boy was it worth it !!!?!!BEST MOVIE OF THIS SUMMER..HANDS DOWN !can i say i expected it..? can not get less if you see the names of the following 2 people involved in creating this movie.. Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg..what's the outcome?A MASTERPIECE !Visual wise..it's unbelievable in many moments,breathtaking action scenes..( who is spider-man ?) The transforming acts are to be teached.they are visually very catching..and hard to follow i might add,and my favorite piece was: ( spoiler ) ( coming up to car fans ! )the mighty Chevy CAMARO..OMG. this car is beautiful by all means..and to transform it into a gigantic robot,it is every man's dream i guess..!!!hard to believe that it was really animation.. Storyline : kept it steady the whole 144 mins.. Never expected it to be funny THAT MUCH but actually it was VERY funny..acting wise..superb job from everyone..chapeau .Michael Bay..you showed us that there is really no limit to creation..congratulation on a job well done..This movie will land on the top 10 movie chart worldwide for all time favorite..let us wait and see..GO SEE IT NOW PEOPLE !",10,4,6,6 July 2007
The Dark Knight," Why so serious ? ... Because it's incredible !
","I never give away a 10* so easily,but when it comes to a movie that good..i had to do it !It's an experience by all means,that you have to be prepared for..i know i wasn't !It was a challenge in every aspect.. A challenge of performances,cinematography,art design,script,score,effects ( sound ),plot and overall the genius directing..OMG! An astonish from start to end,most of all the great late Heath Ledger and an unforgettable almost unprecedented performance as The Joker,i mean Jack Mickelson was amazing,but this is legendary..i don't don't care that Heath is dead,this is an Oscar WINNING performance in all aspects!Hanz Zimmer & James Newton Howard,what an astonishing score that kept me feeling as if the music was an unseen leading actor who is visible through sounds he's making,who's very much alive and interacting throughout the whole movie.My favorite superhero was always and always will be Batman,The original Batman and Batman returns were top notch at that time and were my all time favorites,now i can add Batman Begins and TDK as my all time favorite remakes of the originals.Thank you Christopher Nolan for an incredible job of reviving the series that way..i can't wait to see your next project..( chapeau ).",10,5,11,25 July 2008
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Don't believe what they're saying,follow your instinct !
","Except that The Pyramids are not around the corner from the Petra Temple.. ( take it from an Egyptian..they're more than 1000 milesapart!) This movie ROCKS !Total summer blockbuster,even surpasses the 1st movie,unprecedented CGI effects that kept me blown away throughout the 150 minutes. Incredible fights with new robots' updates. Insane plot...that could only come to life through the mind of the great Michael Bay and the immense Production led by Steven Spielberg.Sorry but i don't see any of the truth in 90% of the comments i read..all i was expecting was a Si-Fi fun ride full of thrills and breathtaking scenes..and that's exactly what i got.Much fun for all the family..don't miss it !",10,12,26,26 June 2009
Hancock," SORRY,but ...what's not to like about this flick ????
","First of all,this movie wouldn't have made it over 50 million box,if Will Smith was not in the lead !! But what do u know,big Will has done it AGAIN !!!This movie is a total chill back ,have some popcorn,laugh about,get excited kinda movie !! In all aspects..a total summer delight..has a bit of everything! True,it's not your typical superhero movie,but what the heck,i don't need a green goblin as a bad guy to be convinced..i just need to be entertained..and that's what i got when i decided to check this flick out. SO,GO FOR IT..you like Will Smith,blown away by Charlize Theron..passionate about SGI and sound ..then this is your movie.A must sea summer hit..you won't regret it.",10,3,12,8 July 2008
The Dark Knight Rises," The Jewel of The Crown
","Only Christopher Nolan, maybe alongside with the uniqueness of James Cameron and Peter Jackson's 'LOTR' .. was able to push his own limits to deliver a better film every time .. I mean ..Batman Begins was a staggering reboot for the Batman Franchise.. The Dark Knight was simply a masterpiece ..in between there was Inception.. an incredible cinematic vision.. ! But this , The Dark Knight Rises.. is ABSOLUTE GENIUS ! Easily a once in a lifetime experience if u watch that in IMAX I mean ,people.. a 2:45 minutes movie that would keep you glued to your seat the entire time without a moment of boredom ..the entire time blown away..the entire time thinking what's gonna happen next..and hits the climax with a genius ending .. i don't know ,but ..this one has Oscars written all over it..and Nolan deserves it after such an incredible effort on his timeless trilogy and a movie that will be remembered for decades to come ! Performances..Tom Hardy,awesome job ' but still ,Joker is untouchable'..Chris Bale, amazing.. Anne Hathaway , definitely a highlight in this movie..OMG! Visuals.. i can't even start! Editing.. genius ! Score.. Heart pounding with every frame,gripping ! Directing.. mind blowing ! You expected to be blown away by this movie ? well .. i'm sure you will be , and beyond ! Best movie of the year ,hands down..and maybe for years to come ! There could easily be a fourth and a fifth installment..but who knows ,uptil now this trilogy is by far absolute perfection among all movie genres,if i may say ! Bravo Nolan and chapeau,for you are such an artist to look up to. And as for Batman.. well .. you'll always be my favorite superhero. Cheers everyone .",10,23,48,18 July 2012
