The Expendables 2," This is garbage.
","A lot of movies have been at the top of my 'worst movies of all time' list, but this has just made it to number one. This is so painful to watch that it took all my self control to prevent me from blowing up my t.v. I don't know what was worse, Chuck Norris making his foolish appearance or Arnold Schwarzenegger trying to talk. Bruce Willis looks like he has some disease. And I could not figure out what the story was with Stallone's eyebrows. He's in good shape but what's up with the face? I thought California had the best plastic surgeons. Oh well. This movie is so bad and the acting is so terrible that the only 'actor' who doesn't really embarrass himself is Van Damme. The only other good thing I can think of is that Mickey Rourke isn't in this movie.What a cheap piece of crap. These guys have lost what little ability they had back in the 80's. Take away the big budgets and good directors of their past and what you have left is a bunch of pathetic meat heads who want to sucker you out of your money and give you nothing in return. Especially Stallone. Arnold, without his muscles, looks like he should be working at Wal-Mart. It's not sad, it's horrible!Everyone else in the cast is forgettable, including Statham, who again plays The Transporter, except with a beret.At least I didn't have to see Mickey Rourke...",1,3,6,21 February 2013
World War Z," World War CRAP
","If I had to describe this movie in one word, it would be CRAP. Let's get the worst thing in this movie out there first: Brad stinking Pitt. Wearing his new age wrist strings and ridiculous scarf, he looks like a pot smoking California yoga instructor. His effeminate hair style and Taliban stubble is not cool, it's stupid. And he's so super-special that every country on the face of the Earth will risk it's best soldiers to get him where he wants to go. Pitt is supposed to be a 'U.N. Investigator.' What? Who in the hell is going to put the fate of mankind in the hands of someone who worked for a corrupt organization like the United Nations? What would qualify a 'U.N. Investigator' to warrant this kind of importance? It's crazy and can only be the idea of a Hollywood leftie in order to make the hero more 'global.' Let me say his job title one more time...a U.N. Investigator....HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!When Pitt is in the supermarket getting the required asthma medication for the mandatory 'asthmatic child,' his wife gets attacked by rapists in the middle of a crowded market while pushing her child in a grocery cart. Did I mention it was in a CROWDED market, with people swarming around them? Totally out of place and unbelievable. This was the first sign, besides Pitt's face, that what is about to unfold for the next two hours was going to be crap. And it was.I can't go into all the plot holes and mistakes because it would make this review 15 pages long. But here are a few...I wanted to walk out when the 'Harvard educated Indian/Pakistani disease guy' made his appearance with his stupid speech in the movie. Luckily, he was so smart that he didn't know how important it was to keep his freaking finger off the trigger of his handgun and accidentally kills himself like the moron that he is. The best thing in the movie is this guy getting killed. Then the entire special team is wiped out because Pitt's wife called him at the wrong time. How lucky Pitt gets away. This is another theme that runs through the movie...Pitt cannot be killed. An entire plane crashes, and the only survivors are Pitt, the Jewish soldier chick, and a woman zombie strapped in her seat. Speaking of the plane crash, why did the passengers start to pile luggage between the zombie infected section and the zombie-free section? Did anyone actually believe LUGGAGE was going to stop the zombies? If a two year old infant pushed on the pile of luggage, no matter how high, it would fall over. STUPID! And before the crash, there was the Israel scene where they had built a wall all around the state of Israel. It worked fine, with no problems, until PITT shows up. Then there's some sort of singing by some burka girl going on, and right then PITT is the first to notice 'it's too loud.' How did her mike get hooked up to all the speakers in town? So, Israel has the smarts to figure out the time to put a zombie=protection wall up, but they had NO IDEA the zombies were attracted to sound? And if there are so many zombies around the walls, where are the people who are shown arriving at check points coming from? Why, in the midst of all the zombies, did a group decide to sing and dance? So anyway, after the plane crash in the hills or mountains of some foreign country, PITT and the Israeli soldier girl miraculously, without a GPS, find their way to the WHO building. They somehow walked there, with PITT impaled by a piece of metal, and the girl who had her hand cut off just hours before. By the way, when PITT chopped off the Israeli girl's hand, there was no blood. Not on Pitt, not on the girl, not on the BANDAGE covering the wound, not anywhere! In fact, there's nothing graphic in the entire film. This could have been a plus, but it was taken way to far. Besides the bloodless amputation of the hand, there's one scene where Pitt hits a zombie with his crowbar, and then is shown trying to pull it out as another zombie approaches. It just looks stupid when you can't see what the crowbar is stuck in and why Pitt can't seem to pull it out. Finally, PITT finds the room with the deadly toxins. He went there specifically to get into that sealed room, and no one gave him the code until he reaches it. Interesting. Then he injects himself in one of the 'safe' diseases, by shear luck. I told you nothing can kill him. He's like Steven Seagal...you can stab, shoot, beat him but he can't be hurt or killed. The main difference is that Steven Seagal never came off like a wimp. PITT, however, does come off like a wimp who doesn't like guns and is more interested in his scarf and wrist strings than he is in shaving. Sorry but I can't go on with this review. It's another one of those movies where, if you think about it too much, you get mad. What a pathetic excuse for a horror/zombie/action movie. It fails on all fronts. I should have known better than to watch anything starring BRAD PITT. I'm just glad I didn't pay to see this thing.",1,7,10,30 January 2014
Hostel," Hostel sucks and blows ass at the same time!
","This was one terrible movie. Next to Devil's Rejects, probably the stupidest horror movie yet. Tarrantino is a moron. His name is there to sucker you into the theater, and then the reaming begins. This was almost as bad as that Kill Bill crap.Didn't I see this 'killing humans can be fun' plot in a Van Damme movie? The main actors sucked and the viewer is happy to see them die. Too bad that jerk lived in the end. And the Asian girl who is rescued...how did her eyeball pop out of her skull via BLOWTORCH? What's the deal with the little kids as criminals? Blood and guts are not entertaining or scary. What's scary about some dufus pulling out a dead guy's organs? What's so frightening about a story on why the killer could never become a surgeon? Why...screw it. I'm not writing anything else about this garbage. Avoid.",1,1,3,22 November 2006
Alexander," Unbelievably Stupid. Never see this trash.
","Colin Farrell sucks all ass. Literally. He's overrated in general and horrible in this movie. If we're lucky this will kill his 'career' and save us from hearing about him anymore. This is three hours of ass-numbing garbage. Angelina Jolie is stupid and unbelievable. Val Kilmer looks mentally ill and what's with the missing eye makeup? Did a two year old do it? Alexander the Great is one of the greatest historical figures you can read about, but this movie will only make you want to find his dead body and stuff it up Colin Farrell's ass.. Seriously, if you liked this movie you are an idiot.",1,8,13,20 January 2005
Constantine," What is this thing?
","Constantine is a piece of crap. This movie blows ass. It's practically unwatchable. Special effects are o.k., but who cares when nothing makes sense? What's up with the guy who plays the devil? What a loser. Why is there so much boiling water in this movie? What's the story with the final scenes taking place in a SWIMMING POOL? Was this filmed at the YMCA? And who the FU*K was that little turd who played Keanu Reeve's 'companion'? Hopefully he'll never get another role after this. If Constantine comes on t.v. and your other choice is staring at the wall, just keep staring.",1,0,5,17 November 2006
Terminator Salvation," Piece of crap waste of money and time
","Sucks is too nice of a word for this crap-fest. I knew from the opening sequence this was going to be an enormous waste of my time, not to mention the 1 dollar it cost me.John Connor is not really in this movie very much, so I don't know why Bale is pushed as the star. He sucks anyway. He really is terrible. It took another over-hyped film The Dark Knight to make people even notice he existed.Lots of the stupid nonsense in this movie is, of course, listed in other reviews here but I've got to mention them anyway.This movie temporarily turned into Transformers when the giant robot came out of nowhere and began stomping things. Why are they collecting people? Why do Terminators struggle to get a hold of someone, TOSS THEM AWAY and then try to get them again? Does that make sense? Why do they have robot/motorcycles that crash all the time and have HUMAN CONTROLS? Bale gets on one and rides it away, so it must have steering and a shifter for humans. Now that's just gay.Why, at the very beginning of the movie, does a handgun shot to the head kill a Terminator who is on the ground, but later on not even machine gun fire to the head can stop them? HOW STUPID!!Just how did John Connor get into Skynet in the first place? This was HEADQUARTERS for Skynet. He plugged something in and doors opened. Hmm. Why have an army when one dufus can just infiltrate Skynet. And only one Terminator was guarding the door!Then, for no reason whatsoever and with no explanation, Arnold Schwarzenneger appears, naked, popping out of some cell where Kyle Reese is supposed to be (why they kept him alive is beyond reason.) Stupid.My favorite part, which made me leave the theater before Bale finished his stupid voice-over during the final minutes, was when the human/robot guy offers his heart to save John Connor. Here, take my heart! I know they just pop right in! You can do a heart transplant, right, pregnant lady? You can do that right here in this TENT! Look, there's a heart-lung machine and a team of 20 and a lifetime supply of anti-rejection drugs sitting right over there! Oh, and forget about compatibility. This will work because this movie is a steaming pile! Thanks for the money, SUCKER!",1,16,31,24 August 2009
Zodiac," Boring and stupid.
","This is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Nothing happens but paperwork and investigative activity by that weird guy from Jarhead and police in tight pants. If you want to learn the most tedious activities of reporters and police, then this movie is for you.Everyone already knows the killer is never caught, so the ending is no surprise. This movie is so long that in the end you won't care and won't remember anything about the ass-numbing characters or story.Oh wait, you will remember two things: spending your money and nearly three hours of your time to see this egghead movie. This is the kind of film that, the more you think about it, the angrier you become because it sucks so bad.",1,15,31,10 March 2007
Silent Hill," Crap Hill
","This movie isn't just a hill of crap, it's the Mt. Everest of CRAP. I'm still trying to get the stink of this movie off me, which is why I'm writing this...maybe I can somehow cleanse myself by warning others to not see this thing. IT'S A TURD OF BIBLICAL PROPORTIONS! I especially liked the part where all the townspeople are together and have that fake ash-makeup on them. They look EXACTLY like a bunch of dopey stage actors in a horrible community theater play. And guess what? That's what they are! A bunch of crappy actors in a disastrous failure.The little kid with a hair-full of gel is supposed to be the reaper? A molested kid is accused of being a witch (why?) and needs to be burned? WHAT? Yeah, so the other reviews say they are supposed to be dead. Hmmm. From what? A car crash where there is no damage to the Jeep that is obviously a product placement? Why didn't the cops and husband find the Jeep and motorcycle AND THE BODIES if they were dead? Did I miss something (of course I stopped paying attention after the first five minutes.)If the townspeople are dead, then why tear them apart with barb-wire? The daughter is hers? No? What's the point of this crap-fest? How is there a video game on this garbage? Seriously, this is one of only a select few of all the movies I've seen that I wish I hadn't watched. The public should demand all copies of this abomination be burned.In other words, do not watch this bomb.",1,2,5,9 March 2010
The Expendables," A mountain of CRAP
","This is easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The previews made it seem like a good action movie, but this is about as far from good as you can get. Stallone looks weird, Dolf Lundgren looks creepy, Eric Roberts seems to have brain damage, Mickey Rourke is simply a freak, and Jason Statham again plays the same character he did in The Transporter, Crank, and every other movie he has ever been in.These actors from the 80's ALL SUCK. Schwarzenegger makes every line a joke, and Bruce Willis is ridiculous. This has nothing to do with the age of these actors. It has to do with the fact that THEY ALL SUCK. That's why people stopped going to their movies in the first place. For example, Stallone made Rocky, then about 50 crappy movies until First Blood, then about 20 crappy movies until Rambo, and then never made a good movie again. People can only take so much crap. This movie is the last time anyone is ever going to give these losers from the 80's another shot. Stallone cannot direct, his lines aren't funny, no one in this movie can act, and nothing in this movie makes sense. I couldn't understand what they were saying most of the time. Who the hell is Mickey Rourke supposed to be? WHAT is he supposed to be? Who would hire this group of unprofessional weirdos? Who were Arnold Terminator and Bruce Willis supposed to be? Willis just swore a lot and Schwarzenegger walks in, says some serious lines that makes anyone watching the movie laugh at his moronic delivery, and that's it. Stallone has screwed the public again, and hopefully for the last time. Screw you Stallone. If you don't know how to make a good movie, don't make anything at all. This is worse than Cobra. Now that's an insult.",1,3,9,26 November 2010
Blades of Glory," Napoleon Dynamite a piece of unfunny sh*t
","That horse-mouthed ugly turd from that stupid Napleon Dynamite movie is a total loser. He has zero talent and ruins everything he's in. I can't believe he keeps getting parts! He should have stayed in Utah.Well, he won't be in the movies for too long, except maybe mormon missionary training films because everyone will soon realize how badly he sucks.Anyway, this movie is just terrible. It's not funny. Unless you find crotch jokes and people in spandex funny. Do you? Will Farrell is getting more irritating with every movie. He also will soon wear out his welcome by putting out these rushed cookie-cutter films. He's not that funny. Unless you find his tubby body funny. Do you?Because I sure a hell don't.",1,6,16,16 April 2007
Tropic Thunder," Thinking of watching this STEAMING TURD?
","I know what you're thinking as you look at the DVD cover for this movie. It's going to be funny! It can't fail! I'm going to be entertained! Tropic Thunder is the opposite of funny. It is the opposite of entertainment. And it fails at everything. It fails so bad that you will hate this movie and everyone in it. How can so many dislike-able actors be in the same horrible movie? Tom Cruise is not funny. Ben Stiller is not funny. Jack Black is not funny. Robert Downey Jr. is not funny and they all suck to boot. The story is ridiculous and unbelievable, even for a comedy, which this is not. It's just a bad, stupid, poorly written piece of crap made to separate you from your money.Don't even watch this for free when it hits cable. Seriously, it is 100 percent pure grade junk. F-You Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Robert Downey, Tom Cruise, and the rest. YOU SUCK!",1,1,7,28 January 2009
Garden State," Loser makes film
","A girl made me watch this movie. This piece of crap is most likely the biggest turd I've ever seen. That dead-eyed stuck-up assmonkey who was in it and also 'directed' it must have used up all his favors to get this made. I wanted to hang myself for sitting through most of it. Natalie Portman is supposed to be cute? Her head is the size of a beachball. And is Portman supposed to be trendy and hip? If being a moron is trendy and hip, then I guess she is. This movie was a painful mess to sit through and all copies of this thing should be destroyed. Screw you Zack-whatever the hell your last name is. You are a loser. Good thing this ended your movie career. Now get off of all media and the world will be at peace.",1,2,6,16 July 2007
The Dark Knight," This is one awful suck-ass movie
","I am not a comic book reading loser or a fanatic of the Batman films. However, I did think Batman Begins was somewhat entertaining, so stupidly I believed that since this film had made so much money in so few days, there had to be something to it. Well, there wasn't.This is a boring, slow, cheaply made movie. The entire budget seems to have gone into making the Batmobile/motorcycle, some explosions, and not much else. The city of Gotham is clearly Chicago. There wasn't even an attempt to make it look any different! One can actually see the word 'Chicago' on one of the buildings during a scene. As for the acting, Batman's costume looked cool and no acting was really required by him. The Joker character was o.k., but his voice was really gay. And what's with the guy with the eye liner? I think he was supposed to be the mayor. Was he gay, too? He should have gotten together with the Joker.The worst of the group was the ugly woman who played Rachel (the slut that led Batman on while dating that irritating Harvey Dent.) She was so hideous I had a hard time looking at the screen. Seriously. Is there a shortage of actresses in Hollywood? What fool cast this creature? This 'movie' is about three hours long. It seemed like ten. And for most of the time, NOTHING HAPPENS! People were suckered into this crap by the hype and the marketing. One could sense the disappointment in the crowd when it was over. I've never seen so many looking at their cell phones during a movie. People paid to be entertained and got a long, slow, stupid, boring, mean spirited, disgusting, ass-numbing piece of crap.The Dark Night SUCKS.",1,25,67,26 July 2008
Avatar," A Crappy Cartoon
","Avatar isn't really a live action movie. It is a computer generated cartoon. The story is Dances With Wolves on another planet. It has the subtitles, Indians, and evil evil Americans coming to take away everyone's land. It is an exact copy! Anyway, this movie gets laughable in it's Al Gore liberalism. The bad humans come from a 'dead' planet where it is no longer 'green.' All because the evil corporation wants the mineral UNOBTAINIUM. The name is so stupid I have to mention it again. Unobtainium...HAHAHAHAHAHA! I thought I had not heard the name right the first time that reject actor who played the corporation guy said it. Who in their right mind would use such a stupid name? Unobtainium??????The bad, evil Marine in charge wears muscle shirts, which is very professional. And I couldn't believe my eyes when the evil Marine in his Matrix 3-Aliens 2 walking robot pulls out a novelty-sized RAMBO KNIFE! Is this the height of technology in the future? A giant comedy Rambo knife? In the future they also allow cigarettes in liberal corporate high tech labs and they let a paralyzed person sleep in transport for 5 years when they can fix spines and have human controlled robots that use massive Rambo knives.The stupidest part of this movie is when the good Marine decides to organize the blue cartoon people to fight the huge, modern evil army. Does this make any sense at all? There was no possible way they could win, so he sent them all into battle knowing they couldn't win with flying dinosaurs and wooden arrows. Then the animals, needing to stay 'GREEN' and save themselves from the evil corporation, somehow organize and fight off the bad guys. So, boring and charisma-free Terminator Salvation guy who's Australian accent comes and goes caused many blue cartoon people to die FOR NO REASON! Their fighting didn't do anything! James Cameron is one of the most hyped directors ever. His movies, with the exception of the first Terminator, all SUCK. He ruined Aliens. The original is a classic but his attempt to copy the realistic dialogue and style of the first was terrible, and he can't stay away from the evil corporation as the bad guy. The Abyss was also very, very stupid and Titanic is one of the worst movies ever made. I could go on as to why his movies suck but there's just too much to list.Avatar is a disaster. But don't avoid seeing it. Watch it and laugh.",1,7,16,5 June 2010
Drag Me to Hell," Drag this movie to the toilet and flush
","Is this the best story line Hollywood can come up with? A gypsy curse? Is that supposed to be original in some way? Why is it that gypsies always have the power to kill people and curse people to death but can't seem to pay their bills on time or go to the dentist? This movie made me realize that Sam Raimi is one of the worst directors of all time. He's made one half-decent movie, The Evil Dead. The other two in the Evil Dead series were totally stupid, with a couple of funny lines that caught on in the cult film world.Evil Dead 3 was total garbage. People want to make the Evil Dead series more than what it is, which is just plain bad. Spiderman sucked as well.Anyway, back to this piece of crap. So this gypsy lady with a very fake accent can't pay her bills, even though she has a clan of relatives who appear later on at her house having a party. Her false teeth fall out, but when she goes to put them back in, you can see the actress's REAL TEETH right before the cut. Then, after stealing a bowl of candy, she begs for a break on her loan even though she's already proved herself to be a deadbeat and an actress with a really terrible fake accent. So who's fault is that? The loan officer, of course. And she deserves to die for doing the right thing! And this is basically the outline for this horrible pathetic excuse for a horror movie.Then, the Mexican lady wants a shot at the demon. She's been waiting to confront it for many many years. It's been her life long goal to confront the demon that is now after the loan officer. She will risk her life to get this demon, and wants to be paid 10,000 dollars to do it! What? If she wanted the demon so bad why not do it for free? This sets up the totally stupid and done a thousand times holding hands around a table and then the floating dancing guy during comedic music (evil dead crap.) So that doesn't work and suddenly the Indian guy tells her to give the button to someone else. Why NOW? Why not when he first found out about the stupid button curse did he not reveal this tidbit of info and save a few lives in the process? And what happened during the nose bleed scene? When blood shoots 30 feet out someone's nose, coating the room and a few people in blood, do you call an ambulance or act like the person had a paper cut? Oh, let's not forget the constant shooting of various liquids into the loan officer's mouth. Constantly. THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE MOVIE! Plus the inserting of an arm and some eyeballs into her mouth as well. What kind of perverted weirdo directed this movie? How does it end? Well, the loan officer, who is dating that ass-head 14 year old PROFESSOR who drives a PRIUS (the liberals got that right) gets dragged to hell after buying a new coat. Why did she need that coat so bad? I'm sick of thinking about this pile of crap. Do not watch.",1,10,22,16 March 2010
Saw," what the...?
","I was curious why they made two sequels to this so I borrowed the DVD from a friend. I couldn't believe my eyes. This is a movie? This is not a rejected student film on public access? By the way, does Danny Glover have brain damage? Does he walk and talk like that on purpose? This was not scary, it was not new, exciting, creative, or anything else. It reminded me of a Taco Bell toilet: stinky and full of crap. The so-called acting blew, the storyline sucked, and the ending...who cared after wasting 90 minutes on this turd. If this thing really made over a hundred million dollars then the world is in trouble. Are people so out of touch they'd pay to see this kind of junk? Don't be one of them!",1,3,6,8 December 2006
The Descent," Another stupid British horror (caving?) movie
","If I had known The Descent was a British horror film, I wouldn't have wasted my time. Remember 28 Days Later? Sucked. The Descent? Sucks! No offense to the British, but they just can't make a good horror movie. And this one is a perfect example.A group of ugly women go 'caving' a year after some dumbass crashes his car while not looking at the road and gets killed by PIPES that for some reason were being carried on the roof (in a tube??) of a SUV. As other reviews have mentioned, the creatures look like Gollum. How original. They live underground, are BLIND? but go to the surface to get food. Yeah, I guess eyes aren't necessary to hunt food on the surface. I'm not going to go into all the implausible details about these things because there are too many. They look stupid and make noises stolen from the movie Predator.The ending made no sense AT ALL. It was so bad I almost destroyed the television.How did the makers of this film manage to hire the most unattractive and unappealing actors in the world? None, and I mean NONE, of these women were interesting or made you care about their characters. And none were cute. The creatures were more attractive. Don't watch this even for free.",1,12,24,29 January 2007
30 Days of Night," This is what I call AWFUL
","New levels in movie history are being met with this film. It is one of the only horror movies worse than The Devil's Rejects and The Descent. Man, does this suck.It starts off with some dufus looking at an old boat, which is obviously a special effect because it looks like a painting and a bad one at that. The vampires soon appear, and they speak some weird stupid-ass language because that's supposed to make them seem special and really old. They always have blood on them and goofy eyes, so you know they're super-weird and super-scary.That moron from Black Hawk Down is a by the book cop, who turns into a vampire killer with his trusty axe. Stupid.Suddenly the days tick by on the screen and it's 29 days of night and then a stupid ending is stuck onto an even stupider and rushed piece of crap film and you realize you've just wasted two hours that could have been spent learning something interesting instead of ruining your evening by renting this junk.Don't watch this crap...",1,5,17,29 March 2008
300," Great movie! Invading Persians get asses kicked violently.
","300 is stunning to watch. The battles are spectacular, the costumes look really cool, and the graphic violence of the fight scenes puts you right inside the action. Add to this the Spartan characters who you want to see kick some evil Persian ass, which they do, and you've got the best film of 2007. Why does this review have to be ten lines? I guess I can keep complimenting this great movie...This is a must-see film. Don't miss it! Definitely will become one of the most immitated movies ever. Great acting by all. Well worth the purchase price of the DVD. Is that ten lines yet?",10,2,5,12 March 2008
