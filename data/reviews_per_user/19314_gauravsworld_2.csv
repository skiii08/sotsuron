The Longest Yard," Not worth it.
","I watched the movie for two reasons, I like watching movies related to sports and because it was an Adam Sandler movie. I have seen all his earlier ones and I liked them all. Even if the plot line was bad or the acting was terrible, the jokes always made up for it. I thought this would be the same.I was mistaken. The movie uses the same old jokes used in maybe about a trillion other movies. They have one, maybe two, original jokes in the movie. The plot line is predictable, something that I expected but then I also expected the humor to carry the movie through.The movie wasn't worth my time really. At the end of it, the only thing that said, 'An Adam Sandler movie', was Sandler's appearance himself, nothing else.",4,3,9,1 June 2005
Cloverfield," Something for Steven to see ...
","I rarely ever login to comment on movies but for this particular one, I just had too.I was very disappointed with Spielberg's war of the worlds and never thought i'd see a movie about aliens attacking a major city again but Cloverfield has changed my mind. It has just the right amount of humans, aliens, military and those little things that eat humans...just right.The best part about the movie is that it's not cryptic at all like War of the worlds was. When I sit down to watch a movie I don't want my mind racing with questions, I just want to relax and watch a good feature and Cloverfield provides just that.",10,1,2,15 April 2008
