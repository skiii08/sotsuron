Child 44," Good movie with a bad review
","Lets take a second here to ponder why someone would think it's OK to shoot a film in English with a fake Russian accent, if you want an 'authentic feel' - as I've seen so many reviewers rave about - just shoot the damn thing in Russian and I'll praise the hell out of every single actor involved in this.As such it does a great disservice to the actors, the story and, I might add, insulting to any Russian speaking audience.I actually thought the movie was good which saddens me even more considering how the performances could have been without that idiotic idea.",Null,4,9,22 July 2015
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Erm
","Lets be fair, summer blockbusters are meant for one thing only : watch stuff explode or have a sci-fi action flick.And actually its usually fun as long as it looks good but this one is just plain shockingly eratic at best. Basically its the same as the previous movie with a few profanities randomly thrown in along fast - like eyes bleeding fast - paced action.Now, I like kitch but giants robots in the woods reminds me of a godzilla-type film made by bored billionaires... seriously ? Thing is I could have watched that kind of stuff in an anime 24 episodes long with a real work on the story instead a 2hrs mindless showdown, ID4 was pretty much the same but still there was people in it (I'd add lexomil acting but that's just me). In ROTF, characters are either robots or just a background to make you wait until the next bots fight. You've got a story going on but given the context, its worse than no story at all; it feels like being added from deleted scenes.I love being entertained whatever kind of flick it is; that movie just looks too random for me but at some point choosing between full CGI or enhanced by CGI movies is a wise idea. Still, kudos to the director for the best laugh I had during a 'lord of the ring-matrix-stargate' story climax, having so heterogeneous plots in a single sequence is really impressive and needs to be noted. Though its not 'Weng Weng' funny just yet.Lastly, acting ... well no one expected good performance so at least, I've got what I though I'd have. Could have been worse I guess - with some rehearsal though.",Null,1,5,30 June 2009
Lucy," 10% is the rating of the movie
","I could go on and on how I used to love Besson's movies, his early work was nothing short of brilliant. This one feels like a second rate TV movie full of BS science every step of the way. If you decide to make everything up the least you can do is make it coherent but it's not even the case here.They used references from a ton of other movies in the worst way possible and you even get a 'Tree of life' kind of shot that doesn't look good while being obnoxiously useless.Oh and .. it's like watching Taxi all over again. Luc Besson is now better as a producer and this tells a lot about his director skills.",Null,1,7,4 October 2014
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Bloodsucking, this movie's got half of it right.
","Ah guilty pleasure.I remember a time when summer movies were action filled with no emotions outside pain in the characters. Good old times indeed.Now let's be fair, that is the kind of movies that will have success not because they are good but because they are hype ... plus, there are vampires in it !What I do enjoy from times to times - and I hope the series will last very long - is to watch a bunch of actors giving their best on that kind of movies. Don't be fooled, they are working their teethes off here. Any long, dark, deep look is methodically worked over several hours of training each day and believe it or not, people from Luxemburg built an acting method from these films.Everyone has a favorite, and keep it to yourself, I do have one too and that would be Jacob, yes, the shirtless guy. I just LOVE his character and women does also as I've heard. I somehow wonder why I have a strange feeling about him when he's so barely able to handle himself and acts like an abusive man, getting angry for nothing and apologizing over and over again until the next anger burst. But I guess looking at his abs have a soothing effect so that's fine.My second choice, of course, would be Bella. I always loved resilient people and the fact that Kristen Stewart is a successful actress despite some serious narcoleptic issues (also called 'dead fish eyes syndrome' by the University of Switzerland) is amazing, go get 'em girl !Out of fairness the Cullens, with collaborative efforts, steals some effectives scenes like 'I'm walking as if I had my brain removed with a hammer' or 'Look daddy ! Your money didn't go to waste, I had a role in a movie even though I don't have the rights to vote due to my mental condition !'.Bloodsucking ... this movie's got half of it right.",Null,9,13,3 September 2010
