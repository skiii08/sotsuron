Mission: Impossible III," Great start to what is expected to be a summer of good movies!!!!!!
","I have been waiting for a while to see this after I have heard they are finally going to give it a green light.I must say I was very impressed with the outcome and must say it had a good solid cast and story. First let me say this.. I don't care what people say about Tom Cruise and his personal problems, but the man is a wonderful actor and makes the mission fun along with Philip seymour Hoffman who was great and made it intense in ways the last two weren't. I really liked the action and story. But all in all a great entertaining movie with twists and turns at every corner and will have you on your seat from start to end. GO SEE IT.....",Null,0,1,5 May 2006
