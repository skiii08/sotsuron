Iron Man 3," Entertaining, but in the end a bit disappointing
","Spoilers ahead.As someone who liked both previous Iron Man Movies (along with most recent marvel movies) I was quite excited about Iron Man 3. After seeing it... well it's a fun movie, I laughed and I was entertained the whole time, but in the end I couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed.The trailers made it look like a more serious take on Iron Man. Now, of course from previous Iron Man Movies (and The Avengers) I was expecting there to be humour but I think they went a bit overboard with it here. This is supposed to be Iron Man facing his main enemy, his biggest trial so far... but the story simply cannot be taken seriously when the director and writers had the need to constantly put in comedic elements. Be it the true nature of the Mandarin or the final fight just after Tony Stark thinks the love of his life died in front of him, it seems the story cannot be serious for more than 5 min without having to put in some joke. Even the big reveal/twist (the fact that 'The Mandarin' was just an actor)was used as a comedic factor. And the post credits scene that I was expecting to start hyping for the avengers 2? Nope, also a comedic scene.The action was good with great special effects, there where even some cool Tony Stark-not quite iron man yet action scenes. If there is one scene I didn't like was the end to the 'final battle', the whole super pepper thing felt over the top in a '1997 batman and robin' kind of way. Same could be said about the 'grab hand while we fall' sceneAs I said, it's still a fun movie. I'd still recommend it for someone who just wants to go to the movies, have some laughs and see some good looking action. But from the trailers, from what was said and from previous movies I was expecting it to be the 'bigger and better' Iron Man movie, so I couldn't help but feel disappointed in the end.",7,2,6,25 April 2013
World War Z," A flawed but fun Zombie Action movie
","I saw several negative reviews regarding this movie, yet in the end I still had fun watching it.For starters, just forget about the name because it has little to no relation with the book. And in second place, you should approach this as an action movie rather than a traditional 'horror' or 'suspense' zombie movie.It is, for the most part, mindless action with some cool set pieces and decent special effects. The plot is rather generic (main character trying to find a cure) and there are several plot holes and unrealistic parts.So yeah, I don't really feel like there is much else to say about the movie. If you are like me and you don't think that every movie out there should be about 'character development' and a 'deep/clever plot'.... and you can enjoy a movie once in a while for just being a fun summer blockbuster with mindless action, then I don't see a reason why you shouldn't watch this",8,0,3,9 July 2013
Man of Steel," Finally a good Superman Movie
","I had some doubts about this movie. Zack Synder is a sort of 'hit or miss' director for me (Loved Watchmen but Sucker Punch and 300 where nothing special, IMO) and the early reviews and commentaries where not specially positive.I went in with rather low expectations but by the end I really liked this take on Superman and this general take on superhero movies. The movie had a compelling story to tell, never trying to be specially 'Deep' but giving us a new look into the origins of superman and giving great focus to both 'Fathers' which defined the man he became. I think it was a rather good mix of story and action, a kind of mix that I would like to see more in superhero movies. The latest batman felt a bit too heavy on the story, giving a rather small amount of screen time to Batman himself (now, I do enjoy them wanting to tell a deeper story with the batman movies, but they can't forget that we are here to see a superhero movie), and the newer Marvel movies have almost felt like comedies with action scenes (Iron Man 3 was basically a series of jokes and funny situations in between action scenes). So it was nice to see Man of Steel keep the serious tone without giving up on the action and over the top fighting.And as we talk about the action, it was really well done. With good use of special effects and a lot of amazing looking scenes.Henry Cavill works well as Clark giving a solid performance but I didn't quite like Michael Shannon's take on ZOD.",9,3,9,17 June 2013
Now You See Me," Fun as a time killer but nothing more
","Now you see me is what I would call a 'sunday evening' movie. It's fun and flashy enough to be entertained for a few hours but lacks more substance to be memorable. It's the kind of movie you can have fun with for 2 hours and then forget the next day.With a cast of well known actors and a plot about a group of people pulling off what seem like spectacular robberies it's clearly that it is aiming to be a 'Oceans Eleven' kind of movie, but it dosen't quite get there.My main problem with this movie is that the basic idea here is that 'you think it is magic but it actually isn't', and that would have great if they would have shown them use clever and creative tricks to fool people. But ,sadly, more often than not we see the main characters use tricks that seem too fantastic to be true, and it dosen't help that most of them are done using CG animations and special effects. All the magic they use is just taken too far to be believed, not only in the illusions but also the fact that one character seems to have super human hypnosis abilities and others can pull off crazy tricks with no preparation.Movies like Oceans Eleven are more enjoyable because even though you know robbing a casino is hardly as easy as they make it look... almost all of what they do has some form of rational explanation backing it up. I don't know if you can Robb a casino making the stuff they do, but I do know that at very least that stuff can be done, and that just isn't the case with 'now you see me' as only a handful of tricks are explained and the writers want the audience to just believe that all the CG/FX tricks going on have a rational explanation.If you take what I've already said into consideration and add the fact that there is little to no character development (we hardly get to know them)and a 'shocking' ending that feels so forced that no one will be 'shocked'... it's easy to see why this movie is nothing more than a fun and flashy flick to watch and forget the next morning.I have been told that there will be sequel, and hopefully they manage to make a movie that is as clever as what they think this one was",6,0,0,18 September 2013
In Time," There are better movies to spend your time
","I saw the trailer for this movie and found the concept to be quite original and interesting. A world where time is money and if your clock reaches zero you die, a world where rich people live forever and the poor struggle to survive.After seeing the score here I though It probably was one of those generic action movies that have a nice concept, kind of like The Island but maybe a bit better. Sadly the movie falls short in almost every way expect for its original concept. The acting is average at most, the script is bad, the is no character development and the story is boring, predictable and lack any sort of back story to help us understand, there is really no explanation as to why this 'money=time' was implement or where it came from. I also felt that most of the time there wasn't anything relevant going on.In the end, this sadly another case of a good idea ruined by a bad bad execution. To stay honest the movie has some entertaining part and it wasn't until near the end that I started to get bored, as a somewhat entertaining time killer movie it's not so bad",6,0,1,26 January 2012
