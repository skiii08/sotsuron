Sucker Punch," Baby doll, is put in an asylum by her evil step father. To cope with her time in the asylum, Baby doll, switches mentally to an alternate reality.
","Well 'You will be unprepared' is aptly quoted. The movie is original in its concept and creativity. Beautifully done graphics and action packed sequences. However, with still a feeble story line.So despite all the brilliant work put in it by its creator and the fairly decent work put in by the actors, the movie falls flat on its face. The continuity is questionable, the switch between the first two realities is very abrupt and not explained at all.The second,third and the fourth action sequences are fairly similar and lack the excitement of the first. Their concept could have been so much more creative.Costumes and make up were well done. The characters were well thought out. Maybe the story lost out during editing or was just left a little unexplained to make it more thought provoking or mysterious. Whatever the reasons, Sucker Punch fails to be as brilliant as it potentially could have been.",5,18,38,28 March 2011
Burlesque," Ali moves from Ohio to LA, to become a singer/ dancer. Struggeles, deters and surprises everyone with her freshness, talent and loyalties.
","Well this movie is amazing. The entire feel is Moulin Rouge meets Sex and the city. From the dances, the costumes, the make up, the hair dos, everything was so freshly daring. The entire look of the movie was so perfect for the entire dramatic effect that this movie required and could easily pull off.Both the actresses, Christina and Cher, were splendid with their vocals and their acting. Although Cher has been seen on and off the silver screen, this was Chistina's first major venture and she sizzled on screen.The only pitfall for the entire movie was its very predictable and very sugary story line. There were no real black moments. Maximum it touched was a few shades of gray.But if you enjoy musicals and have a penchant for dramatics, this is a perfect watch.",8,8,8,28 March 2011
