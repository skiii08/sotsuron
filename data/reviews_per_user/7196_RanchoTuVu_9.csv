3:10 to Yuma," logically disjointed but gripping western
","3:10 to Yuma always had an interesting moral ambiguity to it with an honest financially desperate rancher trying to salvage his life and family and his pride by delivering an infamous outlaw to a coming train while fighting off his gang in order to earn an honest $200.00 and save his ranch. This version has terrific editing of the action, a lot of which has been added on, including a fantastic stage coach robbery. The outlaw himself is as bad as can be and yet has his own sense of justice and fairness which is in the best tradition of famous American outlaws. If anything this film is maybe too reliant on its action and the great acting while letting a few holes mangle the plot. Why didn't Ben Wade just ride out of Bisby in the first place? Lets get captured so that we can introduce him to failing and disabled Dan Evans (Christian Bale). The overall impression is a solid combination of action, acting, great sets, photography, editing, etc.. while one wonders about the logic behind it all.",8,4,8,13 March 2008
Chinatown," watered down noire
","A film about LA and water set in the l930's during a drought with a dark incestuous subplot and some stunning performances by Faye Dunaway and Jack Nicholson, and superb cinematography that seemed to capture the essence of LA. Directed by Roman Polanski, who makes a terrific cameo appearance as a switchblade wielding heavy, and using the considerable acting talents of John Huston as a ruthless and perverted landowner. Read Cadillac Desert to know about LA's water grab but see Chinatown for its brilliant allegory of water and corruption, both public and private. The direction, the screenplay, the acting, the photography, and the soundtrack combine to make a convincing and atmospheric picture. The crushing ending is just so much more icing on the cake.",9,84,128,28 May 2005
The Grapes of Wrath," political drama
","Evicted from there land in Oklahoma, victimized by the double whammy of the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression, the Joad family loads up their dilapidated truck and makes the journey to California, joining thousands of others in the westward migration, seeking work as pickers in the California groves. John Ford doesn't let us forget what it's like to be destitute as the film details the belittling attitudes they endure at every stop along the way, eating away at whatever pride they have left. And when the torturous journey claims the life of Noah Joad (Frank Sully), the eldest of the family, his haunting and memorable burial along the side of the road provides one of the film's most riveting scenes. Clear social and economic distinctions, police brutality, Red baiting, blatant injustice, and the glimmer of hope offered by the New Deal are all mixed up to make this epic saga of an American family.",10,2,4,21 July 2005
The Dirty Dozen," classic World War II film
","Twelve condemned soldiers are chosen for a suicide mission to attack and destroy a well defended castle housing German officers. Lee Marvin plays their commander. The film is divided into two parts: the training of the men and then the mission itself. The casting and director made this an instant classic in the WWII film genre. Robert Aldrich brought out the humanity in these condemned soldiers who have nothing to lose. John Cassevetes takes the best acting honors IMHO. But everyone is great, especially Lee Marvin as the renegade Army officer who leads them. Aldrich masterfully blended action with character.",10,1,4,3 January 2007
No Country for Old Men," follow the bloody trail
","A violent cat-and-mouse story about an underemployed Vietnam vet (Josh Brolin) who is chased by a determined hit-man (Javier Bardem) after coming across the bloody remnants of a drug-deal-gone-wrong and two million dollars in cash somewhere in the desolate west-Texas borderlands. The opening twenty minutes or so, in which Brolin, who is out hunting antelopes (?) and discovers the crime scene, are simply mesmerizing. Bardem's relentless chase to find and kill Brolin and recover the money is what the film primarily focuses on, and it brings out both his and Brolin's characters, which are both fantastically well- acted. The chase straddles the Texas-Mexico border, somewhat reminiscent of Walter Hill's awesomely good 'Extreme Prejudice'. There is a philosophical angle, from the novel by Cormac McCarthy, that the film is based on, that makes this notably more than mindless action, but that creates an ambiguous conclusion that challenges the viewer's expectations.",9,2,3,11 March 2015
The Illusionist," nice looking but hollow
","The Illusionist is a good looking film set in Vienna in the nineteenth century. There's plenty of romanticism, empiricism, and mysticism to ponder over as you try to keep awake with the plot about a magician, no an illusionist, who's trapped by his class, born the son of a carpenter, and can't have the woman he really loves, a duchess, who's equally trapped in her royal status. Not to sell the film short, the story includes a career police officer who's pushed and pulled by a cruel crown prince who promises to make him mayor of Vienna in exchange for his complicity. Their relationship is the film's most interestingly done facet, especially as the police officer noses around into a murder that brings him closer to Mr. Crown Prince. The film's best scene is when the Crown Prince is hunting on his estate and fires off his shotgun, bringing to an abrupt end the talk he was having with the police officer. In the end, it's a meticulous recreation of a time, which isn't nearly matched by a meticulous presentation of a story.",6,19,31,10 October 2006
The Insider," big tobacco
","A long but good enough to keep one watching movie detailing a surprising true story about 'Big' tobacco and their responsibility for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of smokers. Equally interesting is the CBS '60 Minutes' episode where they lost their nerve and pulled an interview they had taped rather than face a lawsuit. It's a classic battle between their legal office and the news people, reminding one of the later film 'Good Night and Good Luck' about Edward R. Murrow, whose spirit and legacy aren't easy to live up to. Tying it together is the nice characterizations and sharp writing, making this movie, if not a thriller, than very close to it. Russel Crowe and Al Pacino are at the forefront, but Christopher Plummer is right up there, playing CBS' Mike Wallace. The movie ingeniously ties together the tobacco story, a very good drama about the power of corporate giants. You keep waiting for the violence to start, but it stays concealed under a tight, well coordinated effort to destroy the whistle-blower, the character assassination that's more effective and damaging than the use of physical violence. The deposition scene in a Mississippi office is one of the best dramatized legal showdowns in a long time. Mississippi, like so many other states, was faced with the costs of caring for all those sick smokers and was at the forefront of going after the big companies to seek reimbursement. How a movie can make a technical legal battle so interesting is a tribute to director Michael Mann and this, perhaps his best film so far. He balances the complexity of the movie, using the talent to create a forceful and constantly interesting film.",10,1,1,10 September 2006
It's a Wonderful Life," Potter probably would have won today
","This film probably ends more happily than any film in the annals of Hollywood, with that great sing a long of Auld Lang Sine as George Bailey discovers what a wonderful life it is. The drama, comedy, and heartfelt sentimentality are all woven together into a seamless masterpiece. It portrays the bitter struggle for the future of Bedford Falls between egalitarian Bailey and hard-nosed miser Mr Potter (Lionel Barrymore). One of the best of James Stewart's films, and that is saying something, and given a magic touch by director Frank Capra, with Donna Reed looking unbelievable, and Thomas Mitchell as the kindly but careless partner who manages to misplace the deposit that ultimately sends the picture into overdrive, it is the best holiday movie out there with the possible exception of the 1951 version of Scrooge.",10,4,8,21 December 2004
From Here to Eternity," army life
","As the Japanese prepare to launch their fateful attack on Pearl Harbor and awaken the slumbering giant, dangerous romances and arbitrary military pettiness occupy the soldiers manning their base in Hawaii. James Jones' multi-character novel gets brought to the screen in a great film that manages to capture something of the essence of the novel, showing army life not as some campfire circle but as a big cynical game of fitting in, going with the flow, and not getting caught. The one purist, a truly fine soldier, fearless and loyal, played by Montgomery Clift, is the polar opposite of all the BS that is around him. He loves the army as if it were his family, but the feeling isn't mutual. The scene where he plays Taps epitomizes his depth and elegance. It's a truly beautiful performance, though not too far behind is Burt Lancaster the master sergeant who's secretly having an affair with the CO's deeply unhappy wife played by Deborah Kerr, a target of rumors that she'll sleep with anyone. We find out why in one of the film's plots, just another lurid episode depicting all the hypocrisy that the story delves into. Their famous roll in the surf is a passionate moment in an exciting and dangerous affair, that this very complex film somehow managed not to short change.",9,1,1,8 July 2005
