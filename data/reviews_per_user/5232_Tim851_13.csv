Lucky Number Slevin," Pretentious
","Now here is a movie that thinks it is so much smarter than it really is.It is awfully splintered, the entire first half hour is more a collage of events than it is a film. Very confusing to figure out what all is about. And the last 40 Minutes are spend in flashbacks telling us the ingenious scheme of the movie and how clever it is, but it's not, seen it all before. Highly predictable and therefore very unsatisfying. I really disliked this disruptive storytelling throughout the film.There is some comedy, although it eventually is a rather dark movie about vengeance. Josh Hartnett delivers a good performance, Freeman and Kingsley are more routine than inspired and Bruce Willis has a very thankless role that could (should) have been filled by someone else. Lucy Liu is very charming as usual.",6,1,3,30 October 2007
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Bait and switch
","I haven't read the book, so I'm just gonna judge the movie.This one to me is like a bag of wasted opportunity. It starts out nicely, more fairytale than fantasy. The first hour is everything that Harry Potter could never be.And then someone stepped in and put the Lord of the Rings in Lewis' head. So all the magical atmosphere is tossed aside and this film just rushes through the motions.With a lack of visual feedback hinting otherwise, I have to assume that all of this grand epic story takes places over the course of two days. Two days in which the four brats are declared long prophesied saviors, have their fair share of uncertainty and doubt, step up to challenge, meet new 'people' who become family after 10 minutes and then lead their army into battle.Because after all, this is no fairytale, this is quickly becoming a bad LOTR wannabe. The battle is ridiculous, but who cares.And it feels totally weird throughout. These are four middle-class kids, who become noble generals. There is one scene that shows them train with weapons, but there is no conveying the sense that they are actually getting prepared. There's no explanation as to why the army would follow them, there is this prophecy thing but it never really transpires.I was seriously considering giving it a 9, and then it slips badly to become everything the Lord of the Ring never wanted to be. Giving it a 5 is mighty flattering of me. But so am I, a grand ol' flatterer.",5,0,1,27 February 2010
Zodiac," Solid
","I really liked this movie - sort of.It is a two and a half hour long story about the serial killer who named himself 'Zodiac' and a bunch of people who investigated on him. Now two and a half hours sounds longer than they felt. Although the movie isn't really fast paced, I couldn't make out any particular lengthy parts.But it's fleeting by. There are about three dozen leaps in the time setting, every other scene starts with 'x days/weeks/years later'. And with no time spend at any date, there is no time to really flesh out the characters. Of which there are a lot. Probably too many. Only one got any kind of tangible background, but it's still not enough to make him credible.Lots of characters on the other hand give lots of fine actors a chance to show their skills. The cast is brilliant. Fine, seasoned actors, most of whom you'll likely have seen before.I liked the pace of the movie, despite the 'fleetiness' it's told without haste and very dry, none of the flashy visual gimmicks you'd come to expect from David Fincher.What really precludes a higher rating than 6/10 is the absence of either a climax or a satisfying conclusion.",6,0,2,18 October 2007
Cloverfield," Fun
","I liked this! Cloverfield is basically Godzilla for the 21st century. There is no plot except for: Alien monster destroys New York and people freak out.The movie lives of the way it's shot. The hand-held camera IS the movie. We've seen the carnage before, the monsters, the battles, the turmoil ... just never from this perspective. It works great! (Although it's not the reinvention of the wheel that J.J.Abrams wants us to believe - Blair Witch Project ... hello?) There is nothing much to judge 'objectively'. The camera-work inherently belittles any acting performance, since there's rarely a steady shot of any actor. The same goes for the special effects or the directing of crowd sequences, etc. But at the end of it all, experienced through the shaky first person perspective, the movie feels sufficiently realistic.The only thing that I didn't like was the voice of the camera man Hud. He annoyed me. His comments were off and people mostly ignored him (rightfully so).I'm giving it 8/10.",8,2,4,1 May 2008
Knowing," A horribly unsubtle movie
","Knowing is as subtle as '80s Hard Rock.From the first scene you know it. There's the little Cassandra character who is a pale, nearly autistic creepy little girl with the ominous stare all the time who writes down a chaos of numbers while in trance. The movie continues along these lines. Nic Cage's character is basically Mel Gibson's (not too great) character from Signs. He's a broody widower, who lives with his half-deaf son in a creepy horror mansion somewhere outside of Boston. His son gets the number chaos from a time capsule at school and Cage somehow finds the date of 09/11/01 in there. The pale standing-around-people from Dark City are back as well.All in all this movie is just a collage of two dozens movies, most of them not really classics to begin with. Not a single figment of it is original.And Nicolas Cage must finally be considered to be amongst the worst actors that are A-list in Hollywood. His performance in this is astonishingly bad at times and barely adequate at best. It doesn't help, that his character is clownshoes. Only trumped by the female sidekick character who got some of the worst writing since the 1950s.There is a lot of CGI in there. Every single scene has been visually enhanced. Some of it looks better, some worse. All looks fake. There are two CGI disaster sequences that are done pretty well. You see they're 100% computer generated, but they look very convincing indeed.3/10, without the disaster scenes it'd be 2/10.",3,1,3,21 June 2009
Transformers," Train Wreck
","I really didn't expect too much, I mean, watching the cartoon series today makes me cringe. But boy is 'Transformers' one bad movie.Action flicks seldom care about good stories, plots and screenplay. But most action flicks don't pretend to. This one, however, appears to have been four hours long, before they cut it to two and a half. It introduces about three dozen characters and just as many mini subplots, all of which are unnecessary, meaningless and stupid. Then they throw in so many bad clich√©s, I didn't know if it was a really bad satire or just reeeeeeaaaaalllly bad. The characters are two dimensional and the girls were obviously picked for looks alone.The only thing the movie could have going for it, would be the action. But no, not really, no. Visual and Special effects have reached the point of near perfection a couple of years ago, and between 'The Matrix' and 'The Lord of the Rings' there's not much left to impress by simply rendering it and showing off the with the coding work of a couple of nerds. The direction of the action is substandard. Most of it is simply having things blow up or chases. Nothing we haven't seen better in so many movies before.So with a sh*tty screenplay and boring action, the only thing that movie has going for it, is the acting of Shia what's his name. I really liked him, I think he's gonna be entertaining in lots of better movies yet to come.",3,9,20,2 October 2007
Blood Diamond," Very good!
","'Blood Diamond' is a very well done movie. There's a good script, good directing and touching acting. Although I do feel that the mini flood of African themed movies in the past couple of years is a bit lop-sided, with most people these days probably thinking of trucks carrying stoned child soldiers when they think about Africa.Anyways, 'Blood Diamond' is political and dramatic. Maybe at times a little bit to action/entertainment oriented in expense of the political framework. Leonardo DiCaprio reinforces his position as the leading actor of his generation.The only thing that bugged me was how they had to squeeze in the obligatory love story. But still: 8/10",8,3,4,30 October 2007
The Descent," Not bad.
","I liked most of 'The Descent'. It's a good horror film to pick up!The all-female cast was refreshing. Although they could have chosen more distinctive looking actresses, the three blondes kept on confusing me for most of the first half. The performances were decent.The build-up was something too. Like 'Wolf Creek' or 'Rogue' this movie takes its time, which is a nice departure from the standard horror formula.I was a bit disappointed with the creatures. When they didn't instantly attack, I hoped, they would make them not just the killing evil. Well they were. And not too good at it. While I certainly welcome non-invincible antagonists unlike the Leatherfaces, Vorheeses and Krugers of the genre, it was kinda stupid how they died in packs.And the beginning was stupid too. Not to ***SPOILER*** too much, but surprise car crashes are like bullet-time: cool the first time I've seen it, lame a$$ copies ever since.",7,0,1,1 August 2008
Inside Man," Redundant
","Another one. Hollywood just made another one of these bank robbery heist flicks where a couple of perps rob a bank with a masterfully laid out plan and a group of policemen trying to figure them out. That's what you get here. It's like they're not even trying anymore. And this one's below average. The ending, which usually is when they fill you in on the ingenuity of the plan, is incredibly boring. Because they basically tell you in Scene 1 what it is. Then there's this totally pointless side-plot, which only serves to waste the talents of one Jodie Foster. Clive Owen spends most of the movie wearing a mask, which some people might agree with. Denzel puts in a routine effort, nothing more.This movie is a total waste of time and money, both for me having seen it and Hollywood having produced it. It's redundant. Like another Billy the Kid movie.",4,2,6,23 October 2007
The Departed," Weird
","I really liked the premise of the movie. DiCaprio and Damon play two guys who grew up under very similar circumstances, one becomes and undercover cop in the gang of Jack Nicholson, the other goes on to be Nicholson's rat at the State Police.For the most part, the movie is a dark and serious gangster drama. But then there are some weird moments. Mark Wahlberg's character is satirical at best and harshly contrasted by the calm realness of Martin Sheen. Alec Baldwin borders comedy as well and Jack Nicholson spends half the movie balancing the thin line between satire and reality. Add to that some situations that struck me as more funny than anything else and I'm stuck with a mixed feeling about the movie as a whole.",7,1,2,21 October 2007
WALL¬∑E," Loved it!
","I didn't care much for The Incredibles, Cars or Ratatouille but Wall-E is just precious.The first half hour or so is near perfect. There is no plot line, there is nothing really happening, it's just Wall-E. And it's just too cute. This movie is connecting emotionally. Some people complain about that and the lack of, let's call it, 'solid stuff' but hey, this is an animation film, if you expected 'The Deer Hunter' with robots you are probably just stupid.Unfortunately (for me) Pixar too felt they needed to squeeze in a real story somewhere and they did. It's not really bad (although a bit too contemporary) and it's rather well executed but it totally contrasts the first half hour and I feel it would've done much better without it.But nonetheless, it's still a 9/10. It's safe to say that people who thought 'Boo' was the best thing about Monters Inc. will love Wall-E, everybody who thought that movie had a great and enticing plot probably won't.",9,3,6,7 December 2008
1408," Nothing special
","This is the story of a cynical John Cusack, who travels the country visiting places that advertise in 'spookiness' and then writes about them in books like 'The Top 10 Haunted Hotels', but he doesn't personally believe in anything supernatural. One day he checks into room '1408' and all hell breaks loose.What he experiences in 1408 is a montage of your average horror flick scares, mixed with a bit of what's real and what's not and spiced up with a little dive into the depths of a tormented soul. Nothing too special though. Only a handful of original ideas, the rest is business as usual.The movie should have been 30 minutes shorter. The ending is, unsurprisingly for Stephen King, not satisfying. John Cusack is being just his usual self, you either like him or not. I do. As I liked Samuel L. Jacksons rather brief appearances.All in all, if you don't watch too many films or play lots of video games, it might strike you as original and refreshing and you'll maybe like it. Veterans of the psycho horror genre will probably be disappointed.I'm giving it 5/10: Average.",5,1,2,21 October 2007
300," 90% is historically accurate!
","Imagine an Iranian director making a movie about 300 upright Cheyenne warriors making their last stand against the invasion of the cruel American army, lead by General Custer, an 8 ft. tall Drag Queen and made up entirely of mutants. There'd be an outcry, it would be labeled evil propaganda. But '300', noooo, this one's based on a comic!If you're the kind of person who can switch off your mind during a movie, then maybe it's enjoyable. You must not think about any of it, otherwise it becomes ludicrous.This is the kind of movie Joseph Goebbels would've weeped seeing. It has all the right fascist ingredients. The Spartans are surprisingly Caucasian for Ancient Greece, the only upright men are warriors, they love nothing better than to die for their country, their freedom, their hypocra....democracy. The Spartans are the Chosen Ones, everyone else is a wimp, a traitor or a weasel. And Persia is in the outer rim of Mordor.Zack Snyder's claim that 90% of this crap is historically accurate is shameful!And the movie itself? The dialog is about the worst I have ever heard, most of it sounded like Klingons talking. One could dub every single line with random fillings of words like honor, blood, glory, etc. and it wouldn't change anything. Visually, it looks like an FHM photo spread. If you hail to the almighty Photoshop, maybe you'll like it. It has no thrill, because you'll know when the Spartans will rip through a thousand men without breaking a sweat and you'll know when it's time for them to die heroically. The action itself is non existent, because all of it happens in slow motion. Half of the movie is Spartans slaughtering the others with the tried and trusted formula: evil one runs at hero, striking a blow, missing, hero cuts his throat.The rest is just hollow. Depictions of Spartan hardness, which equals all things good. This is a movie that calls out to that shifty little figment of Manliness so many people have. People who talk about blood and honor, patriots, nationalists. People who think of battlefields as places where boys become men, where men become heroes. If you're one of them, by all means, go and see it, you'll love it!",2,2,4,16 October 2007
