The New World," The New World of Cinematic Tedium
","Acclaimed Director Terrence Malick comes out of hibernation to concoct this moribund outlook on the legend of Pocahontas. The year is 1607, and King James envoys set foot on the rustic shores of Virginia, intent on building the first European Colony in America. They encounter the Powhatan Indians, but no epic battle ensues. Terrence Malick focuses his energy on the romantic bond between authority challenged sailor John Smith ( Colin Farrell ), and the Powhatan princess Pocahontas ( Q'Orianka Kilcher ). I haven't watched a movie this slow paced since Moby Dick was Tuna. Scenes of affection between Smith and Pocahontas are repetitious, and indeed the order of the day. The accompanying monologues in voice-overs complete the moviegoer's zombification process in an 'EYES WIDE SHUT' sort of way. I did manage to refrain from exploding in an outcry of ' WHAT'S NEXT ? '. What's next is more of the same, with settler John Rolfe ( Christian Bale ) vying for Pocahontas' heart, following Smith's departure from the settlement. A reprieve from the doldrums is granted in the form of sporadic attacks by the indians, but this is not sustained. You see, war is not an angle of this historical saga Malick wishes to contemplate, and that's really a shame. Wes Studi, known for his compelling Indian Warrior performances in 'Dances with Wolves', and 'The Last of the Mohicans' is only here to adorn the Virginia wilderness. He might as well have been building sand castles at nearby Chesapeake Bay. I hope his star rating doesn't drop like a cliff-diver in Acapulco. Malick compensates for an obvious lack of variety in his material by prolonging scenes of Pocahontas' playful disposition to kingdom come, slowing the pace of the movie to a nightmarish crawl. The Cinematography is eye catching, and the symphonic score is somewhat enjoyable. The acting by the main actors is commendable ( Kudos to Kilcher for a respectable debut ), but this is a rather boring flick destined for the DVD shelves in double quick time. The storyline is painfully mono-directional, and I just couldn't keep myself interested for 2.5 hours. I could be standing on the buffet line for crow two months from now, but I don't anticipate huge Box Office receipts for this tortoise of a movie.",5,3,9,24 January 2006
Constantine," Constantly fiendish
","I'm not familiar with the Hellblazer comic series upon which this film is adapted. I'm reviewing this flick strictly on its own merits. I trust that most moviegoers who peruse this kind of reviews are merely interested in opinions about the quality and entertainment value of the opus, not whether or not the art bears total allegiance to the original material. So, is this movie good or bad ? Well, this flick is not the ne plus ultra of cinematic excellence, yet it is worth watching. Sorry for the ambivalent repartee, but the truth of the matter is that Constantine is neither a very good flick, nor is it a bad one. What works here is that you have a somewhat different genre in the realm of horror motion pictures. The plot is interesting, and relatively complex. You must bring your full armada of cerebral endowment to the movies with you, because if you don't understand the Kafkaesque sub-plot sequences, you will not enjoy this film. I watched the flick with a lady friend who at the end revealed to me that she didn't like it. When I asked her if she understood what was going on in the climax involving Constantine, Lucifer, the angel Gabriel, Satan's offspring, and Rachel Weisz' character, she responded that she was completely oblivious as to what was transpiring on the screen at that moment. Well, no wonder she didn't like this movie, because if you don't comprehend the climatic scene of a film, how can you like it ? If you don't understand the plot, you can still achieve a modicum of satisfaction with fiendishly impressive montages of Hell, and a pretty slick exorcism scene that dramatically improves on Linda Blair's The Exorcist '. The acting here by the main characters is good, but as with any Keanu Reeves' movie, it is overwhelmed by the paragonless special effect work which makes this flick worth watching.",Null,0,14,20 February 2005
Ocean's Twelve," Oceanic Letdown
","If you haven't seen the previous installment ( Ocean's 11 ), this sequel is actually decent entertainment. For those of us who enjoyed the brilliantly conceived casino heist in Ocean's 11, and who were hoping for an encore, Ocean's 12 is a disappointment, like most recent sequels. This franchise main theme, as enunciated in the first installment, is spectacularly clever heists by a crew of world class robbers. Moviegoers expect sequels to live up to the established theme. Ocean's 12 fails to abide by this principle. There is no substantive heist in Ocean's 12 to speak of. Robbery scenes, if any at all, are rushed, and hardly completed by even more rushed retrospective/flashback sequences. The folks who produced this flick just couldn't muster the patience requisite to achieve a comprehensive heist scene which made Ocean's 11 so compeling. The Break dancing inspired Yoga job, against a security laser barrier, by the French master robber, is so not believable as to be galactically pathetic. You actually feel robbed after watching that sub-moronic scene. This is an hackneyed sequel, probably rushed to the screen to ensure that the all star cast here is retained to capitalize on the success of Ocean's 11, and what we get is pure cinematic platitude. If you'd like to moderately enjoy this film, you must forget about the previous installment.",Null,1,2,23 December 2004
Million Dollar Baby," A Champion of a movie
","This is paragonless cinematic storytelling. Clint Eastwood plays an aging boxing trainer who reluctantly takes under his tutelage an aspiring female pugilist, played by Hilary Swank. Boxing is just a sub-genre here, providing a platform for a compelling story about life circumstances, human character, and the vagaries of fate. Morgan Freeman, in a near flawless performance, plays Eastwood's sidekick in the management of a decrepit gym. Hilary Swank is brilliant in the portrayal of someone determined to realize a dream against tough odds, and overcome humble beginnings. The pool of characters in this movie is an excellent sample, or so it seems, of the human landscape in modern society. You will relate to one or more of them as they cope with personal demons and jockey for position in the rat race. This, however, is not a reprocessed rags to riches tale a la 'ROCKY' , as many moviegoers would rather have it, I'm sure. This movie imparts a brutal reminder that there is absolutely no method to the madness of fate, and that in the boxing ring of life, good people are not always the last ones standing. This is as good a film as you'll ever have the opportunity to watch. To say otherwise, I respectfully submit, would be a hopeless attempt at contrariety.",Null,1,2,6 March 2005
