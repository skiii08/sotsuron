Frost_Nixon," Intelligent AND entertaining. Why can't all films be like this?
","Director Ron Howard's Frost/Nixon chronicles the true story of British/Australian talk show host David Frost, who decided to interview former U.S. President Richard Nixon after his 1974 resignation in the shadow of the Watergate accusations. The film follows Frost's decision to self-finance the interview, his complex relationship with Nixon and the now-famous interviews he conducted with the former President during 1977.At the very heart of it, Frost/Nixon is a very moving and emotional film. I was satisfied and pleasantly surprised to see it got what it deserved by the Academy - at least nominee wise, that is (for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor for Frank Langella's excellent take on Nixon's controversial figure, among others) . Walking into the theater, I have to admit I was expecting a talky snooze-fest like 2005's Good Night and Good Luck. Instead, I found a true and unique movie that really tried to see what made both Nixon and Frost tick, and show that above all, it wasn't the politics - but first and foremost the dynamic relationship between the journalist and the ex-president, which led to Nixon's confession regarding his involvement in the Watergate fiasco.Personally speaking, I thought the film excelled in not trying to portray Nixon as an evil president, but as someone who truly believed he was working for a greater good, and that the end's thereby justified the means. Langella gave a stunning performance in that category, and made me want to visit the film again when it arrives on DVD - in hope of learning more about that turbulent time in American history and in hope of preventing a second Watergate from occurring.I gave it 9 points out of 10.",9,4,7,22 January 2009
Walk the Line," I became a die-hard Cash fan after watching it, and I'm sure any of you other casual viewers out there will become so too
","Truth be told, I've never thought highly about Academy Award nominee actor Joaquin Phoenix, despite watching him in numerous films (The Village, Ladder 49, Signs, 8 MM and more). It was only when I happened to stumble upon the Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line during a free screening I won on the internet, that I discovered this great, versatile, larger than life talent in all his glory. If I didn't know any better, I could have sworn that Phoenix was the Man in Black himself, singing and going through the complex notions of life on screen. The young actor literally became Johnny Cash, and the amount of electricity and enthusiasm that went into his role was enough to light up any Ring of Fire in sight.In Walk the Line, director James Mangold and actor Joaquin Phoenix took what could have been another routine retelling of a great musician's life (a la Ray or De-Lovely) and turned into a musical romp, with the help of Phoenix's dead-on performance and Cash's original songs, that helped introduce this recently deceased country music phenomena to a whole new generation of admirers.Now, enough about the Phoenix jabbering There's one more cinematic god, I mean goddess, to thank for this musical masterpiece. Reese Witherspoon, previously famous for her dumb-yet-sassy-blonde role in the Legally Blonde travesties, made a gigantic leap into the big league due to her portrayal of the unstoppable June Carter in this film. Carter, a country music talent on her own right, was also Cash's stage and bed partner, and eventually became his long-time wife (after an endless period of courtship). Since both leads deliver the musical bits single handed, words can't express the awe I felt upon encountering Witherspoon's dramatic and vocal side. As much as the film chronicles Johnny Cash's rise and fall, it also follows the bittersweet love story between Carter and Cash, with some of the most powerful sequences feeding off from the tension and chemistry between these two alone.Walk the Line, to me, is an epic tale of fame, music and love; while at the same breathe manages to be something different completely  an ode to one of the 20th centuries biggest musical talents. I became a die-hard Cash fan after watching it, and I'm sure any of you other casual viewers out there will become so too.",10,2,3,23 July 2007
The Ring," Meet Samara  the creepy, crawling, neglected young girl who haunts people through video tapes and slithers out of your TV screen
","It seems as if every decade needs an iconic horror figure. Be it the 1970's Alien, 1980's Freddy Krueger or the 1990's I Know Why You Screamed Last Summer at the Scary Movie thingy. Come the first decade of the 2000's and you get Samara  the creepy, crawling, neglected young girl who haunts people through video tapes and slithers out of TV screens.The effective 2002 American remake to the Japanese hit strikes a chord every time I watch it and still gives me the Willies every time I re-watch it on cable or DVD. It's a healthy mixture between thrillers and horror films, serving chilling delights for its target audiences on each and every twist and turn. It's almost hard to believe that the charming 17-year-old Daveigh Chase is also the girl behind the voice of Lilo & Stitch's Lilo. That thought alone scares more than this wonderfully horrific must-see ever will.Anyways, this film is highly recommended, but don't try watching it alone (or answering the phone while you're at it).",10,5,9,20 March 2007
Minority Report," Left me very satisfied thanks to the accurate storytelling, engaging special effects and unique setting and vision of the not-so-far future
","Phillip K. Dick based movies are somewhat tricky. When in the right hands, they can turn into true gems (Blade Runner, Total Recall); although they also tend to become mediocre from time to time (Paycheck) or just plain messes (Next). This time around, though, P. Dick gets the royal treatment, with the help of one Steven Spielberg (director) and one Tom Cruise (star). This dynamic duo of extreme talent hands out one of the most accelerating and captivating sci-fi adventures to ever embrace the silver screen. The film, as a whole, left me very satisfied – thanks to the accurate storytelling, engaging special effects and unique setting and vision of the not-so-far future.The story follows John Anderton (Cruise), head of Precrime, a futuristic police force whose genetically enhanced employees have the unique ability to foresee the future, therefore helping the unit's policemen to prevent crimes before they occur. This technological advancement quickly gets out of hand when Anderton becomes the prime suspect of a future murder he is about to commit. Thing is, Anderton doesn't know the victim, and soon becomes a victim of the system he so dearly embraces. Questions of the morality of justice and law enforcement ensue, as Anderton embarks on a journey to both prove his innocence as well as find out who's really behind this crime.Once the action shifts gear, you'll have a blast. Look out for excellent performances by Collin Farrell (in one of his earlier roles) as the investigator trying to beat Anderton at his own game; and Samantha Morton as Agatha, one of three Precrime enhanced predictors, who has the ability to see the 'Minority Report' and predict the flip-side result of the upcoming crime.",10,3,6,3 July 2007
Training Day," Training Day makes The Departed seem like a walk in the park
","Talking about defining rolls, try watching Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke in this highly unorthodox crime feature. What starts as your everyday police drama with the trained cop (Washington) showing the new rookie (Hawke) some bad ass moves, fastly turns into a nightmarish all-night experience as we learn more and more about the true nature of Washington's character. Hawke triumphs as the accidental hero of the movie, who is thrust into talking his way out of near-death situations and learns how to survive the crooked streets fast. The final 15 minutes of the movie are some of the more intense and violent cinematic experience I sat through in recent years. There's no doubt abut it, Training Day makes The Departed seem like a walk in the park (and that's saying a lot).",10,0,2,7 December 2007
Unbreakable," A subtle tale of men becoming what they were destined to be
","After the phenomenal success of The Sixth Sense, everyone was curious to see what director M. Night Shyamalan had in store for us next. The result was Unbreakable, the most original idea for a (major spoilers ahead!) comic book/superhero movie I have ever encountered to date. Even seven years into the future, the final play of this film manages to send these small shivers of joy down my spine.Dealing yet again with humans with supernatural talents, Shyamalan takes his time building his characters (as usual) and slowly introduces us into their downbeat world. Bruce Willis is David Dunn, your everyday Joe who miraculously survives a horrific train crash. Dunn holds a secret: this isn't the first time he walks away unharmed from a near-death situation. Shortly after his media-frenzy survival, he encounters his counterpart, Elijah Price (the fabulous Samuel Jackson, in one of his best roles ever). Price suffers from a rare medical condition which basically comes down to him having extremely fragile bones, which tend to break ever-so-easily. The two men then have numerous encounters which have drastic affects on their lives, but I'd rather not spoil the fun for those of you who intend to see the film.I think what really got me hooked up on this film was the final twist, which was on par with that of Shyamalan's initial attempt (if not better); and the dreamy, subtle atmosphere which sucked you me for the mere sake of curiosity. Bottom line, Unbreakable is a tale of men becoming what they were meant to be; one that leaves you pondering whether your destiny is a matter of free will  or something you can never escape no matter how hard you try.",10,0,0,3 July 2007
Memento," Over 5 years after watching Christopher Nolan's breakout hit Memento for the first time, I'm still not 100% certain I 'get it'
","I have to come out and say it  over 5 years after watching Christopher Nolan's breakout hit Memento for the first time, I'm still not 100% certain I 'get it'. I can discuss the film and analyze the life out of it, but there will always be huge cheese holes left in my various theories as to what exactly led to our protagonist Leonard's unique situation. A situation that, for those who haven't seen Memento yet (are there any of those left out there?), led to Leonard's devastating loss of ability to process and withhold any kind of short-term memory.Either way, Nolan's bold choice to tell the story backwards and break the old fashioned linear storytelling is worthy of all the praise it can receive. Compliments also go to Guy Pearce, for creating a compelling character I believe psychiatrists will discuss for years to come. Alongside Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and The Bourne Identity, this is yet another superb 2000's movie to deal with the delicate subject of (loss of) memories, and come out triumphant as a captivating piece of cinema.",9,0,2,24 March 2007
Finding Nemo," One of the best animated films ever to see the grace of a movie screen
","One of the best animated films ever to see the grace of a movie screen, Finding Nemo is a classic piece of cinema that'll probably stick around for decades to come. The classic story of a kid looking for his father looking for his kid finds new life when re-located to the bottom of the ocean. Taking the manifestation of aquatic life, the movie confronts us with one of the most beautiful and miraculous secrets this Earth still has to offer. To balance it all up, Ellen DeGeneres's forgetful-yet-unforgettable Dory brings in the masses with her witty voice over, while the endless variety of colors and vivid imagination rolls in the rest.Finding Nemo is one of those few films that'll make you want to laugh, to cry, and to embrace your loved ones over and over again.",9,0,2,24 March 2007
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Best X-Men film by far. Period.
","Earlier this week, my wife and I caught an early press screening for the upcoming X-Men Origins: Wolverine and we both went absolutely bananas. The screening was held in Ramat Gan, Israel, on an enormous screen, and it was a real delight. The surround sound system and the huge screen gave it all an epic feel, and helped emphasize the magnitude of the movie. At the end of the day, I found it to be on par with Iron Man, Spider-Man 2, X2 and other successful comic book films from the wonderful universe of Marvel.Truth be told, I went into the film without any big expectations, since I don't carry much knowledge about the character's background - and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised both by Hugh Jackman's engaging portrayal of the character and the light shed not only on Wolverine's origins - but on many of the other members of the X-Men as well... Back when the original trilogy was released (in 2000, 2003 & 2006) I managed to catch them all, and after reaching the new installment to the series, i'm happy to report that X-Men Origins: Wolverine corresponds successfully with the series, while still managing to rise and shine on it's own merit. Wolverine's story was a gripping tale of revenge and knowing one's boundaries, and served as a successful prequel to the whole X-Men series.The way I see it, All people involved in this spectacular summer hit deserve a great big kudos. I really hope the fact that a work-print version was leaked to the internet a month before the theatrical release won't hurt this film's truly deserved chances at box office glory come early May. In my opinion, this is a movie meant to be seen on a big screen if i've ever seen one. If this thing flops because of the leak, more quality products of it's ilk won't get a cinematic release, and we'll all be sorry... All in all, X-Men Origins: Wolverine was real cinematic fun, and an excellent set-up for (what seems like) a truly spectacular Summer of films. Keep up the good work, folks!",10,23,59,24 April 2009
The Others," A sharp horror thriller with one of the more memorable jumpy scenes in a while
","The final collaboration between Nicole Kidman and ex-husband Tom Cruise (he produced, she starred) is a sharp horror thriller with one of the more memorable jumpy scenes in a while ('Who are you? What did you do with my daughter'; 'but mommy, I am your daughter') which also earned the film a rightful parody on one of those endless Scary Movie flicks. While the twist has already been used in other films (*cough*), the film as a whole is a real roller-coaster of excitements and scares every horror buff owes himself the right to watch. Look out for the spooky setting that takes place exclusively in the area of the house, making the structure a living and breathing character in the film - perhaps more than some of the real characters.",9,7,11,24 March 2007
Troy," War stinks, Troy rules
","Countless words have been written in the course of these past 3 years about Wolfgang Peterson's 'swords and sandals' epic, Troy. However, I still don't understand why this beautiful retelling of the historic battle of the walled city remains in the minds of so many a mediocre product at best.There are so many good things going on for this film, starting from its ultra-wide cinematography, spectacular fight scenes (especially the 'dance fight' between Hector and Achilles), and superb performances by Brad Pitt, Rose Byrne, Eric Bana and Peter O'Toole (amongst others). More so, the most memorable anecdote I personally took from the film was the careful and balanced point of view Peterson took when showing both sides of the story. This allowed us as viewers to gain an objective perspective of the war, after learning the advantages and flaws of each side. Bottom line: war stinks, Troy rules.",9,4,8,17 March 2007
The Day After Tomorrow," The end of the world never seemed as photogenic as it seems in this disaster film
","German director Roland Emmerich, who never ceases to search for new ways to destroy New York City, outdoes himself once again in this spectacular epic that took my breath away over and over again just from watching its trailers. Emmerich, who already wreaked havoc across The Big Apple with aliens (Independence Day) and monsters (Godzilla) recruits the biggest villain of them all to cleanse the city of its immoral ground this time around  mother nature itself.When an abrupt global warming occurs, a father (Dennis Quaid - Innerspace, Dragonheart) swears to do anything he can in order to save his beloved son (Jake Gylenhaal - Brokeback Mountain, Donnie Darko), who is stuck in the middle of a damaged NYC. While this little tale might feel touching and cute at times, it's obvious that the main characters of the film are the special f/x that amaze the viewer over and over again. Being such, Day After Tomorrow serves as a 'must see' for anyone who values big-budgeted disaster outings, and doesn't mind having a side plot pretending to be 'Finding Nemo' on ice and hurricanes. Because in the bottom line - the end of the world never seemed as photogenic as it seems in this disaster film that stars Quaid alongside youngsters Gylenhaal and Emmy Rossum (Mystic River, The Phantom of the Opera).",9,3,4,9 April 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," The ultimate Pirates of the Caribbean adventure
","If I'd had to choose a favorite installment from the Pirates of the Caribbean film, my choice would surprisingly go with 2007's At World's End. Back at the time it received some negative reviews. To me, however, it was the highest peak of the original trilogy (which started with Curse of the Black Pearl way back in20'03), bringing together plot threads and characters from the two previous ones and giving us Captain Jack in all his glory - as if to let the series go out with a bang. Obviously it didn't, since we got a fourth installment in four years later, but that's another story...Anyway, to me, At World's End felt like a truly epic adventure, the culmination of the first three. Someone wrote elsewhere that as the series advanced, the films got bigger and bigger – and to me, this is a good thing.The beginning with the memorable chant 'A pirate's life for me' followed by the coin flipping and the title appearing on screen dictated the town of awesomeness that then followed. After that, the film was just filled with zany, wacky and hilarious adventures all jumping at you from all corners - the multiple Jacks stranded in no-mans land, the Keith Richards cameo as his father, the surprise twist with the Calypso character, the pirate brethren, the Chinese threat arising from the east, the countless twists and turns which followed our beloved characters from the previous films.And finally, there was this bittersweet ending to the Will and Elizabeth story, that made you look back and remember this amazing trilogy and appreciate it for its entire extravaganza - especially this third chapter which, although at times convoluted, was the biggest, wackiest and most epic installment of them all.I gave it 10 out of 10.",10,0,1,21 May 2011
Spider-Man 3," The rumors are true - Spidey 3 is the best of the lot!
","By now you've all probably heard the rumors about the quality of Sam Raimi's latest addition to the pantheon of big-screen adaptations for comic book classics (aka Spider-Man 3). If not, let me give it to you straight and simple: they are all true.Spider-Man 3 is the best film of the Spider-Man trilogy to date. In fact, it's bigger and better than its predecessors on so many levels; I don't even know where to begin. It's in this third installment of the series that the director allows the now matured and established characters to fully realize themselves. By doing so, Spider-Man 3 becomes a plot-driven piece of film, alongside being your lovable big-budget summer uber-buster as well. It is this cinematic achievement that'll make future audiences admire this film long after its initial box-office impact will worn off. And trust me; this will be an enormous hit from a mile if I've ever seen one (note that this review is typed on Thursday, April 26th, 8 days before Spider-Man 3's US premier, after I had the pleasure of attending a special press screening in Ramat-Gan, Israel).The thing is, I've never been a big fan of the first Spider-Man. The second one was much better, in my opinion, but only after seeing it I realized how much the original was required in order to establish the three main characters - Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), Mare Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and Harry Osborn (James Franco). This time around, this impossible love triangle finally dukes it out, as other character building devices, such as Osborn's oath to avenge his father's death, Parker's long yearning for MJ and his deterrence in finding anyone linked to his Uncle's death in part 1 - all reach a staggering crescendo, with some extremely dramatic consequences. On top of this all, Parker also has two brand new enemies to fight off - one of them being the alien form commonly referred to as Venom (Topher Grace in a nice change of style from his usual shenanigans) and the other being a small time escape con who by chance enters a scientific facility and is transformed into the Sandman (the always wonderful Thomas Hayden Church).At the end, it all comes down to a battle between good and evil, with messages of redemption and remorse playing a crucial role in the way the plot unfolds. The digital effects are at the top of their game as well, and entertain at the purest level of awesomeness (sorry, couldn't find a more subtle word). At some point, I remember telling my girlfriend what a great time I'm having - something I don't remember saying at the theater for some time now. Also, I am very glad the writers tried to close as much arcs as they could, making the trilogy as a whole smarter and more satisfying.As expected, Spidey 3 is not without its flaws, with many dialogs being somewhat cheesy and mostly clichéd (although it is a comic book adaptation, so don't expect Shakespeare), and a lot of the religious/patriotic themes were a little too much to bear. However, this all doesn't really matter that much when you're watching a film like Spider-Man 3. The main idea here is to sit back and enjoy, and hope Summer 2007 can maintain this level of quality throughout its upcoming blockbusters.",9,151,305,26 April 2007
Yes Man," Carrey is back with a bang. Yes! Yes! Yes!
","Being a teenager in the 1990's, I have to say I was never a big fan of Jim Carrey's mainstream performances in the movies that made him the star that he is today. Hits like Ace Ventura, Dumb & Dumber and Liar Liar left me mostly indifferent to Carrey's rather obscene personality. It was only when he shined in more complex roles like The Truman Show, Man on the Moon and eventually Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind that I grew to respect the wide range of characters Carrey is able to bring to life.Over recent years, Carrey continued doing his thing, moving from comedy to dramatic roles and vice versa. The problem is that all of the sudden he wasn't alone in the ring anymore, and countless other comedians have tried to slip into his shoes to various degrees of success. There was no place to deny it; Carrey was in need of a hit to re-establish his place in the Hollywood sky.Cue the brand new comedy Yes Man, that finds Carrey once again in his favorite 'What if...?' sub-genre. This time around, he plays Carl, a lonely divorcée that has somehow alienated even his best friend (portrayed successfully by Wedding Crasher's Bradley Cooper). Carl is stuck in a dead-end job at a bank, yearns for his ex-wife and spends his evenings watching rented DVDs... all by himself. When an old friend introduces him to a corny self-help program (lead by a hilarious Terrence Stamp) that persuades him to answer 'yes' to every question thrown his way, Carl's life takes a dramatic turn.As expected, the new approach gets our hero into all kinds of wacky situations - such as spending a steamy morning with his horny elderly neighbor (!); meeting a potential Iranian wife through an online service; partying all night whilst drinking countless cans of Red-Bull and over excessively helping a homeless person. Luckily enough, it also introduces him to the extremely free-spirited Allison (portrayed by the ever-so-cute Zooey Dashnel).If you've seen the average Carrey comedy, you can probably guess how the plot unfolds from here on out, necessary complications included. The format is more or less the same of what we've been used to seeing Carrey perform in his comic outings, with the main idea being a modern moral story urging people to stop going through the motions of life and start seizing the day. But I digress. It seems as though years of perfecting his comic roles as well as starring in more 'grown up' roles have tamed Carrey a bit. A lot of the arrogance and awkwardness revolving his earlier films seem to be missing this time out, and instead I could actually feel true emotion and heart in Yes Man. It seems as if this fact alone contributed greatly to the fact that most of the punch lines actually worked here and I found myself smiling for the larger part of the film.Some points that still managed to ruin some of the fun are: A. As mentioned above, the film was very predictable, and formulated at that. B. Carrey has definitely aged recently, and it's starting to show. The age gap between him and Dashnel left me feeling somewhat uncomfortable.However, all in all I had a great time with some excellent laughs - and at the end of the day that's what really counts (:",9,160,220,15 December 2008
Zodiac," Sorry to disappoint, but I just didn't like it...
","I watched David Fincher's Zodiac with my Fiancé and another couple of friends back when it was in theaters. It started out OK, but after a while, it didn't really reach a substantial point and just went on and on and on (and on). I mean, honestly, did they actually need 3 hours to tell the story of a serial killer the police didn't even catch? Come on! Another low point was that once the plot shifted toward Jake Gyllenhall's character it turned out to be another film completely. This could've been nice somehow, but the trailer, you see, sold me a cinematic thriller, not the story of a geeky journalist on a vendetta of some sort. And what's that about his wife leaving him and saying their marriage was 'a date that lasted too long' after they were married for more than a few years and even had children?!? How can you dismiss such a long relationship in a single breathe? It was just too unbelievable for me...",3,1,3,15 December 2007
The Prestige," Nolan's real follow-up to Memento
","After his brilliant breakout film Memento, director Chris Nolan went on to create the forgettable Insomnia and the overrated Batman Begins. The third outing to come (The Prestige), however, is his real follow-up to Memento, in my own honest little opinion, both in quality as well as in depth.This moody and complex film is a real treat for cinephiles wherever they are. Describing a fatal rivalry between Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), two competing magicians in 19th century London, it capitalizes largely on the length some people will go just to get even with their professional opponents. While the magic displayed on screen is what catches your eye at first, it is the swirl of emotions our two lead characters go through that makes this a true delight. Spanning over numerous years, we see Angier and Borden going from great career and personal heights to the lowest bottoms in their pursuit of the one true magic trick that'll make people remember them for years to come.To top this all up, the movie itself acts as the ultimate magic trick, with its various acts working as the required steps that allow us to fully enjoy and realize the final twist for all its brilliance and originality.",9,2,3,10 April 2007
Closer," Loved it/Hated it
","Mike Nichols has caught lightning in a bottle with this baby, a dark twist about romance-gone-wrong which, on a more personal level, I will always approach with some ambivalence. This gripping epic involves Clive Owen, Julia Roberts, Jude Law and Natalie Portman all over each other over a long period of years during which they love, hate, cheat and make up (not particularly in that order). It's one of those films that makes you think long and hard about you life and the relationships you experience along the way. I also can't help but feel that the conversation I had with my Ex Girlfriend after watching this together led to our eventual break-up. Oh well.(Note: don't miss the magnificent song 'The Blower's Daughter' by Damien Rice from Closer's soundtrack. Such a sad, touching song).",9,1,1,18 February 2007
The Devil Wears Prada," The chick flick that got straight men to follow...
","About 45 minutes into this film, I noticed the lead characters finally took a moment to breath. It was quite refreshing, though, since I don't recall seeing another verbal film where the actors (or actresses in this case) can't seem to shut up, yet there isn't a dull moment to spare. Wherever you turn to in the Prada universe, something happens. The fantastic Merryl Streep shines as Miranda Priestly, the magazine editor from hell, and Anne Hathaway marks her way cautiously into becoming the next Julia Roberts (or the next 'it' girl at the very least), after a starring in a string of kiddie hits (The Princess Diaries 1-2) and a quick breast flash (Brokeback Mountain). The story is your basic 'small town girl hitting big city life' cliché, but it's carved with so much glamor and style and fashion and wit  you'll soon to be caught in the act as well. And yes, I know it's basically supposed to be a 'chick flick' but I believe Prada has it's honorable share of male followers as well  mostly straight, by the way (surprise surprise).",9,0,0,5 March 2007
The Aviator," Scorsese and Dicaprio shine through Howard Huge's tragedy
","Martin Scorsese's grand masterpiece chronicles the true life of the troubled young Howard Huge, portrayed accurately by Leonardo DiCaprio, in what I believe is his best role to date. Being an orphan myself, I could relate with the character's loneliness and solitude throughout the film. While I still can't afford the luxury he lived in, I too feel my accomplishments will always be in the shadows of my late parents. I would, however, like to believe I have a brighter future ahead of me than the one Huge eventually had. Even though he was a pioneer in fields like cinema and aviation, Huge's mental illness never let him bask in the light of his achievements  and that, I believe, was his greatest tragedy.",9,2,3,24 March 2007
The Matrix Revolutions," Revolution is the most satisfying installment in The Matrix trilogy, if not plot wise, than at the very least visual wise
","The Matrix Revolutions picks up on the cliffhanger note Matrix Reloaded ended with, showing us the aftermath of Neo's decision to break the pattern of The Matrix  thus having his special powers become helpful both in reality as well as within the Matrix. This installment has a more religious tone, and portrays Neo's journey to the city of the machines in the real world as nothing less than a Christian epiphany (the comparison between Neo and Jesus is all but inevitable). While this thematic twist may request a large suspension of disbelieve on the viewer's behalf, the final battle between Neo and Smith; the ironic fact that both combating sides now have a common enemy (Smith); and the remarkable eye candy of the combat of the human resistance against the machines entering Zion  well, lets just say that all this more than compensates for this. Revolution is the most satisfying installment in The Matrix trilogy, if not plot wise, than at the very least visual wise.",10,0,4,14 July 2007
Cast Away," Cast Away glows in retrospective as a chilling drama that foreshadowed things to come
","With little words and many emotions, Tom Hanks prevails in Cast Away as the sole survivor of a plane crash who is forced to learn to live alone on a deserted island, with a football he calls Wilson being his only companion. Four years before Lost saw the light of day and one year before 9-11, Cast Away glows in retrospective as a chilling drama that foreshadowed things to come. However, the fact the film is followed with an optimistic note and has some truly moving sequences, gives us all hope there might still be a light at the end of the tunnel. Kudos also goes to director Robert Zemeckis who managed to turn this one-man-mission into a moving journey of faith and hope.",9,3,4,2 March 2007
Lilo & Stitch," Either way you turn it, Lilo & Stitch is a keeper. They truly don't make them like this anymore
","2002 may seem a long time ago now, but in fact only 5 years have passed since then. Back at the time, I was a 21 year old soldier, serving my third and last year of obligatory service in the Israeli army, counting the days left until I could be a civilian again. Anyway, I remember coming home one Friday after two weeks at the army, and I was all tired and worn out. Luckily enough, my ex-Girlfriend (we just started dating at the time) insisted we go out for dinner and a movie. I could still taste the gourmet meal I ate, and smell the popcorn that greeted me upon entering the theater. Needless to say, I wasn't the film buff I am now back then, and I entered Lilo & Stitch without any previous knowledge about what to expect.After all this time, I still don't know if it was the whole atmosphere of the brief vacation from the army or the fact it was an over the top animated masterpiece from the get go. As anyone would tell you from personal experience, it's all subjective anyway. Fact of the matter is, I instantly fell in love with the film and its lovable characters. The story of an alien being (cute and cuddly as he may be) who is stranded in a place miles away from home made me relate to my own personal status, having to serve in the hot and humid southwest area of Israel, hundreds of kilometers from my own home. Once I was there, feeling for the ridiculous looking Stitch, I soon developed a gradual empathy to Lilo, the little girl who adopted Stitch after mistaking him for a dog, as I myself am an orphan, and I can see why she needed a dog to share her emotions.Now mix all this with the hilarious animation, numerous likable side characters, beautiful Hawaiian setting, refined Elvis Priestly soundtrack, and you got yourself a winner. Lilo & Stitch manages to be silly and intelligent both at once, and to this day makes me laugh and cry simultaneously (I obviously own it on DVD). It's the last traditional animation outing that was a big hit at the box office as well (if memory serves me right, it earned nearly 150 million dollars in the US alone), and there's an obvious reason for that. Like Shrek 1&2, The Incredibles, Finding Nemo and other 3-D CGI animation films, it keeps its plot simple and easy to follow, when all the while manages to pay gestures to older films and themes us grown ups can relate to; thus really living up to the cliché that insists a G rating is for everyone from 4 to 90 9or something like that).As you can tell, I first and foremost fell in love with this film for sentimental reasons, but at the end of the day, what made me watch it again and again over time was its original mix of Sci-fi and traditional animation, unbelievable funny scenes (try watching Stitch running over the toy model of San Francisco and tell me you didn't laugh) and simple morals of family and friendship. Either way you turn it, Lilo & Stitch is a keeper. They truly don't make them like this anymore.",10,9,11,23 July 2007
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," A big spit in the face
","Judging by the trailers and the build up throughout the past 9 year and 6 movies, I was expecting HP7a to be a grand finale with a big showdown between Harry and Voldermort. Instead I got Harry and Hermione zapping from one place to another with seemingly no purpose, little to nearly none plot or character development, etc. Also, there were yet more questions asked (instead of the kind of answers you'd like to find in a penultimate film of a very long franchise), and - to top it all - major characters died off-screen (who does that?), and again, I didn't really see what point this served.Last but not least, I felt like the ending was a big spit in my face as a fan. Instead of dragging the damn thing and filling it with unnecessary gloomy stares courtesy of Harry, Hermione and Ron, they could have at least sneaked in one big action sequence that'll satisfy the audience. Why not give us some answers about these Horocrux's? Why not arrange a mini-meeting between the lead protagonist and the villain, like we've been promised in the trailer? Instead, the film just ended suddenly, abruptly, courtesy of the greedy suits in Hollywood. Thanks a lot. Not.",4,3,6,27 November 2010
Little Miss Sunshine," A touching drama that makes you feel for each and every one of the characters without retrieving even once to genre clichés
","Family values have been an 'it' thing in theaters ever since the medium was invented, yet somehow the genre keeps producing fresh entries every few years. In 2006, it reached a new height when both critics and audiences as one praised the independent hit that could - Little Miss Sunshine. A dark tale about a malfunctioning family, this road trip comedy is a touching drama that makes you feel for each and every one of the characters without retrieving even once to genre clichés.The cast of LMS is made up of incredible B-list actors who are way unappreciated for their cumulative works. Academy Award nominee, 11 year-old Abigail Breslin (Signs, Raising Helen), delivers the performance of her lifetime as Olive Hoover, a precocious little girl who scores a place in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty competition by default. Thing is, Olive is funny looking and not all that talented, but there isn't a soul in sight to tell her that. Her father Richard (Greg Kinnear, Academy Award nominee for As Good as it Gets) is a failed motivational speaker; her uncle Frank (Steve Carrel, in a wonderful detour from his usual shenanigans) recently tried to commit suicide; her brother Dwayne (Paul Dano, The Girl Next Door) is under a willing vow of silence and loathes the very essence of his family; and her grandfather Edwin (Alan Arkin, who received a long deserved Oscar for his role) seems to be the only understanding soul around, but also takes drugs and is obsessed with porn during his free time. Olive's desperate mother, Sheryl (Toni Collette, Academy Award nominee for The Sixth Sense), is determined to let Olive compete in the competition, which is held on the other side of the US, and manages to gather the malfunctioning members of the family in their VW mini-bus. From here on out, a macabre-yet-invigorating chain of events begins, thrusting the family into absurd scenarios and eventually bringing them closer together. On their road trip from hell, the Hoovers experience run-ins with the law, car trouble, sibling rivalry and the ultimate test of them all  a beauty pageant for little girls. During this chain of events, however, they learn to appreciate and even love one another, and get to deliver a strong message against exploiting preteens working within the fashion industry.You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll want to hug the adorable Olive, but most of all you'll smile. This memorable little drama is a tour de force of talent in display, and a perfect original film who stands out in a world of sequels, remakes and huge franchises.",10,1,3,14 July 2007
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," One of the best finales I personally have ever seen on the big screen
","One of the most profound childhood memories I will always remember was seeing Terminator 2 on the big screen. The scope of the plot, the groundbreaking effects, and of course  the one and only Arnold Schwarzenegger, than at the prime of his cinematic career  created a larger than life experience that made me tremble like the little kid I was at the time.Naturally, I was one of those very eager fan boys that looked forward to the third installment of the series upon its release 12 year later, and unlike many of those  I wasn't disappointed with the final result that unfolded before me on screen. Sure, the story seemed somewhat rushed at times, and the basic plot contradicted the final conclusion of the previous film; but once you get over the initial frustration from this sudden change of arc, you're in for one very intense action ride.While the plot here is similar to that of the previous films  with one Terminator sent to the past to kill off the future resistance against the machines and the other sent back to protect humanity's last chance  what's good about this film is that we actually get to see how Judgment Day actually occurs, with the final 10-15 minutes of the film being one of the best finales I personally have ever seen on the big screen. Once you realize that this time its for real, and the events have been set to begin the greatest attack ever set against mankind, you get that tingling feeling back inside  the one you got upon viewing T1 & T2. This unique and special feeling, and this alone, is worth the perfect 10 I give Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.",10,4,7,11 April 2007
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," A quintessential action movie - T2 is a sci-fi roller-coaster that defined an entire generation of moviegoers!
","In my book, Terminator 2: Judegement Day was one of those rare flashes of genius Hollywood bumps into every once in a while. From the breathtaking visuals (that still hold well after 18 years) to the maverick storytelling (kudos to legendary director James Cameron for that) and genuine performances by the cast members (not just Schwarzenegger's Terminator, but also Linda Hamilton as one of the best female heroines ever, as well as Robert Patrick as the ruthless killer T-1000) - T2: Judgement Day was (and still is) a roller-coaster of movie making at its finest. Plot-wise, it advanced the series' cannon story of the apocalyptic future where robots rule the world and human resistance is strong yet outnumbered. This time around, the robots send the shape-shifting T-1000 to destroy Sarah Connor's future-leader-of-the-resistance, John Connor, at the tender age of 10. But their attempts to destroy the human defiance is met with a precocious John Cononor, his mother Sarah (who has since the fist installment) has turned into a lean, mean, killing-machine) and the aforementioned Terminator (the one and only Schwarzenegger), this time being on the right side of the resistance.When this movie was first released back in 1991, I was a mere 10 year old child (just like John). I remember watching it twice at the movie theater and being blown away over and over again each time. If there was anything I was ever close to idolizing as a kid, it was T2 (especially Arnold Schwarzenegger). I remember later dressing up as The Terminator for Purim and hanging a very big poster of the film over my bed. Those were good times, and i'm sure current-day viewers will have a positive experience watching this as well.P.S. - I also liked T3, but it was less loyal to the first two, which marked it a lesser film in my book (although it did include one of my favorite endings ever).",10,4,5,21 May 2009
Ocean's Eleven," The slick and sly group hand out a magnificent performance as they make you realize that sometimes, in certain aspects and circumstances, crime does pay  and with an interest
","Long before Thirteen and Twelve, there was Ocean's Eleven. A salute to Hollywood's golden era where glamor and glory graced the silver screen, Eleven was a cool breathe of pure cinematic fun when it initially hit theaters during the winter of 2001. Being a remake to a forgotten Rat Pack 1960 release only added more glitter to the story  as director Steven Soderbergh managed to recruit some of Hollywood's finest current talents to this intelligent remake. When you come to think of it, there really isn't that much room for mistake when you have living-legends George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts and Andy Garcia as your main leads.If plot is of any importance to you, you'll probably want to know this is about Danny Ocean (Clooney), an ex-con who just got out of a 5 year period behind bars. Determined to make a final heist before he retires from crime (yeah right), Ocean finds the perfect target  a casino owner named Terry Benedict (Garcia) who has his eyes out for Ocean's ex, Tess (Roberts). With the help of his ten newly recruited accomplices (each individual specializes in a different field of theft), he plans the perfect crime  simultaneously robbing three Las Vegas casinos owned by Benedict. The suave gang of criminals soon set their plan in motion, working every little detail leading up to their final move.The slick and sly group hand out a magnificent performance as they make you realize that sometimes, in certain aspects and circumstances, crime does pay  and with an interest. Kudos go to Soderbergh and his gang for this one, as I truly had a ball watching it, as I'm sure they did making it (btw, the sequel, Ocean's Twelve, is a far inferior predecessor to this film  but the threequel, Ocean's Thirteen saves the prestige of the trilogy).",9,0,1,3 July 2007
Hardball," Forgotten gem of a film, Hardball is an adorable little sports feature you won't want to miss
","Now here's a little forgotten gem of a film that had the misfortune, or shall I say audacity, of being released on September 14th, 2001, only three days after the day the world changed forever.It is mostly this misfortune to blame for the fact that this adorable little sports film is mostly overlooked and unappreciated. It's a shame, though, as Keanu Reeves really shines as a lost soul who gets to coach a team of Little League baseball players by mere chance. Dealing with mostly African American kids from the projects of Chicago is never an easy thing to do, but through some clichés and many true moments of genius, Reeves's character manages to find himself again. Oh, and you'll really fall in love with Notorious B.I.G.'s 'Big Papa' after seeing this tear jerker (and yes, I know it sounds lame, but I still felt obligated to mention this).Enjoy!",9,0,0,7 December 2007
The Butterfly Effect," What if there's an alternate life for you somewhere, out there, where the cumulative sum of your choices leads to a better reality, a happier and more fulfilling existence?
","What if you could go back to major junctions in your life and take the other path? What if there's an alternate life for you somewhere, out there, where the cumulative sum of your choices leads to a better reality, a happier and more fulfilling existence? On the flip-side - what if, at the end of the day, you really can't achieve a solid grip on these things, no matter how hard you try?A great deal of science fiction works of art have tried to approach these meaningful questions throughout the years, all presenting many philosophical ideas and notions as to how one man can change his own fate, for better or for worse. In this surprisingly good sci-fi adventure from 2004, directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber (who are also behind the screenplay of Final Destination 2) raise all these questions once again, but use a different angle this time around. Time travel is not the issue here. Instead, our lead protagonist, Evan Treborn (portrayed by Hollywood prankster Ashton Kutcher  but more on that later) leads his whole life up until his early 20's without knowing he has a rare medical condition that seemingly helps him shut away traumatic incidents that occurred throughout his childhood and adolescence years. All he remembers from these various occasions are bizarre blackouts. But when a blast from his past comes back into his life only to leave it ever so tragically (Kayleigh Miller, portrayed by the lovely Amy Smart who we've since seen in films such as Just Friends and Crank), Evan learns that he can return to those important lost moments in his life and re-inhabit his younger body, thus changing the present and future. However, with every shift in the past comes an alternate present that may seem better at first, but is in fact a far harsher reality than the original one Evan has left.What truly touched me about this film was the essence in which it captured the troublesome youth of my generation, that was born in the 1980's, grew up in the 1990's, and is ever since trying to adapt to the ever changing reality in which we all live in. Here, one man tries to alter all this, and his own personal journey is parallel in many ways to the journey many young people go through nowadays. Part of capturing this Generation X notion is the pop-culture presented throughout the film. When you see the young actors and actress fall in love, fight, and grow up real fast, it all happens amidst references to films of the period (Se7en, etc.), outfits, 1980's technology and other devices that fill you up with an overwhelming feeling of nostalgia and sentiment, as if you were there yourself, living these events and going through all these horrible/wonderful events.Above all things, the makers of The Butterfly Effect do the unbelievable and turn Ashton Kutcher into a good actor  a feat I thought was unachievable at best. However, in this sci-fi epic it appears as though anything is possible. Bottom line, it was a fresh breath of air when I saw it, left me pondering for days, and gave me the inspiration and write something myself after a long period of writers block. If a film manages to be this inspirational and keep you on the edge of your seat throughout its 113 minutes duration, all I can do is humbly bow down in front of its makers' talents. I'm eagerly waiting for other outings by these young folks.",10,171,214,28 July 2007
Before Sunset," Leaves you with this depressing notion that no matter where life takes you, you will always be disappointed and unsatisfied...
","The sequel to the adorable and dreamy Before Sunrise from 1995, Before Sunset meets the original film's characters, American writer Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and French social activist Celine (Julie Delpy) nine years in the future, in the year 2004. The turn of the century definitely made it's impact on our two heroes, as did the turns of time. Now being 32 years old (as opposed to 23, the character's age in the first film), they are both much more mature and much less naive about what life has to offer them. Sure, on the outside they both made it well: Jesse is married with a child he thinks the world of, and is just visiting France during a PR tour for his recent published best seller (loosely based on his night with Celine, by the way). Celine, on the other hand, is engaged in a meaningful relationship as well, and after living several years in the states, where she finished her second degree, she is now an active member in several environmental organizations. Alas, underneath the surface, they are both aching inside. Neither of them is happy with the life he or she is leading, and they both find themselves compromising in cozy relationships and careers, with the memory of that mid-90's night still very much alive in their hearts and minds.This time around, Jesse and Celine stroll around Paris rather than Vienna, and as much as this city is beautiful and filled with inspiration perhaps even more then Vienna, it is something we have seen in many films as well, and the cinematography doesn't really indicate something new about the city. As opposed to Sunrise, the two lost souls now only have time until Sunset to catch up with each other, when Jesse's flight back to the states leaves. They spend their few hours together talking about their 1994 rendezvous and how it altered their lives, then exchanging their mutual disappointment from the twists and turns of life, touching numerous social ideals on the way.Sunset deals with some interesting concepts of second chances and becoming sober from all sorts of promiscuous ideals one might have as a young individual. It is a mature, self-aware film, that meets our heroes now leading a much more realistic, yet extremely disappointing, life style. While all this might add up to a positive overall viewing of this feature film, I myself found it to be quite anti-climatic in comparison with Before Sunrise. Since I know real life is often depressing, and rarely leads one to his true calling of his heart, I often turn to movies in search of a more escapist experience, that'll shed some light on my life, rather than paint my future in very bleak colors. As a 25 year old young adult currently writing this review, I would like to think that life has more to offer than yearning for some old sweetheart while watching my years fade away. Whilst Jesse eventually gets his second chance to meet Celine in Before Sunset, the movie never really lets you know what happens with them afterward, and instead leaves you with this depressing notion that no matter where life takes you, you will always be disappointed and unsatisfied for large periods of times. Being such a stubborn dreamer, you would have to excuse me for not buying into this perspective of life (yet?).For what it's worth, I could have been much more satisfied have I had only seen the first installment of this love story, being left with much hope and desire, rather than being faced with the biting reality in the second installment.",6,1,4,24 December 2005
Revolutionary Road," Sitting through torture would be less depressing than this film
","So you think life's tough? Well, you ain't seen nothing yet! If you really want to suffer, try living in 1950's suburban hell. In that period, women's freedom and choice of career was virtually non-existent, and whoever tried to shake this equation, often found themselves on the wrong side of society's ability to tolerant social turbulence.In American Beauty director Sam Mendes's adaptation of the bestseller Revolutionary Road, Frank and April Wheeler (portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet together on screen for the first time since Titanic!), a young, suburban couple going through the motions of life. April, who doesn't want to play the role of the lonely housewife, makes life miserable for husband Frank, who can't seem to make her happy. When April comes up with a daring idea to relocate to Paris, France, the consequences of the decision manage to make the couple's life even glummer.Personally speaking, I found Revolutionary Road to be a depressing experience, lacking the optimism or cynicism director Sam Mendes demonstrated in films like American Beauty or Jarhead. Instead, everything that happened to the characters of the film was so tragic and sad, that I was counting the minutes for the thing to be over. The acting was good, but nothing we haven't seen before in the department of suburban melodramas - even those starring the same actors (Winslet was much better in Little Children, which was more or less similar to RR, except that it took place in modern day and was much more tongue-in-cheek fun). DiCaprio was OK, but good thing he earned his Oscar recognition for bigger, better roles like The Aviator and Blood Diamond and not this train-wreck of a film.Now, I don't know about you guys, but these sort of blunt, straight-out realistic dramas don't help me feel better about myself or get a better perspective of life (like I believe most films should do). Instead, this film just left me shattered, annoyed and disturbed - and truly unsatisfied.I gave it 5 point out of 10 (and only because of the decent acting).",3,10,18,23 January 2009
28 Days Later...," The first in a long line of feature films to emphasize on our collective fears for humanity in the post 9/11 era
","Imagine waking up and finding out you're the only living person left wandering around the streets of London. You walk countless kilometers, yet there's no one out there. Pretty creepy, huh? Now imagine the only living sound you do hear eventually is coming from blood-thirst zombies. That's more like it now, isn't it? Bottom line  28 Days Later is one of the best zombie flicks to come out in a while, which also works as a gripping apocalyptic account. Shot with a relative low budget, it was the first in a long line of feature films to emphasize on our collective fears for humanity in the post 9/11 era. It also brought Cillian Murphy into our lives, and that could never be a bad thing.",9,0,1,20 March 2007
2012," The ultimate disaster film!
","I've recently watched 2012 during a press screening in Ramt Gan, Israel - and it's everything you can expect from a movie like this. The special effects are top notch. So breathtaking, intense and gripping that at times I found myself sitting at the edge of my seat. The main premise is the usual mix, with a family, a scientist and the president of the United States all struggling to make it through the end of the Earth. The latter two stories are filled with clichés and very predictable. However, I did feel emotionally connected to the angle regarding John Cusack and his on screen family's struggle to survive - and since they were the main focus of the story anyway, it worked well in my book. Also, throughout the film there is an incredible sense of urgency, which contributed greatly to the build up.The story is your basic end-of-the-world chaos thingy. This time around, the Earth's crusts are shifting - causing earthquakes and volcano eruptions on a global scale, followed by unfriendly tsunami waves. The governments of the world have some sort of a solution, in the shape of giant ships located in China (not spoiling anything here, this is said from the beginning of the film and is indicated in the trailer as well), and the movie follows the family's journey towards their destination, en route to China. As expected, they manage to flee and escape most of the horrific events happening around them and stay intact. Meanwhile, we get to see most of the world's biggest iconic monuments get destroyed in vivid ways - including The White House, the Jefferson Memorial, the Christ the Redeemer statue in Brazil, the Vatican in Rome and many many more.As indicated earlier, a main reason the film worked for me was the emotional connection I felt towards some of the characters. The cast here is top notch, including some recognizable actors like Woody Harrelson, Thandie Newton, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Danny Glover, Oliver Platt, Amanda Peet - and of course, John Cusack. The cast seemed as if they were having a great time shooting this film, including some necessary tongue-in-cheek implications. Never the less, many philosophical and emotional elements of redemption and survival of the fittest were also added into the mix - making 2012 a better film than it had the right to be. Sometimes, one might even forget that the chances these events will all happen at once are small at best. Now, if only the clichés were a bit less over-the-top and the premise less predictable, this could have been one hell of a masterpiece. But then again, even when 2012 doesn't necessarily bring anything new to the table, it's still one hell of a roller coaster ride – and an excellent winter blockbuster to close the year with.",10,261,509,7 November 2009
X-Men: The Last Stand," Too much talk, not enough action...
","I had the delight of watching X-Men 3: The Last Stand during a special press screening that was held in Tel-Aviv, Israel, 12 days before the US premiere. Although much cannot be said about the film without giving away any potential spoilers (and there are many of those to be spread around), there are certain things that could be said that will help clarify the fog revolving the film's premise.The most important thing that could be said is that this is indeed the last X-Men film that will be released in theaters. The film ties up the various plot strings that were thrown at audiences during the first two films, and closes up the personal arcs for most main characters. It picks up more or less where the last film left us; As we have seen at the end of X2, the evil Mystique has infiltrated the US government, human vs. mutant conflict ensues, whilst meanwhile back at the X-Men headquarters, we find Wolverine and Cyclops still pretty much shaken up by the loss of Jean Grey. Darkness continues to grow as we find out at the beginning of the film that Jean Grey is very much alive, but the ultimate sacrifice she had made at the end of part 2 in order to save her fellow mutants has turned her into a very different and dark character. Meanwhile, the Magneto-Xavier dispute about how the mutants should live their lives amongst mundanes receives a surprise twist, when we are informed that the humans have developed the ultimate anti-mutant weapon: a vaccine with the ability to 'cure' mutant powers. The now ex-prisoner Magneto, threatened by the thought of mutants being wiped off the face of the planet with the help of the vaccine, gathers an army of mutants to fight off the human's new threat. Our favorite heroines, led by Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Storm (Halle Berry, who gets substantial screen time this time around), must make the last stand amidst the chaos, and find the way to struggle for a peaceful solution, even when everything around them seems to be falling apart.More than anything, X-3 is a fascinating character study, although many characters we met during the first two films are absent, or suffer from very little development. Instead of minimalist performances by Anna Paquin's Rogue or James Marsden's Cyclops, we are now introduced to new on screen characters such as Dr. Hank McCoy (a.k.a. Beast), played by the always wonderful Kelsey Grammar (from television's Fraizer), or the walk-through-walls Kitty Pryde (a.k.a. Shadowcat). Unfortunately, many of these personal arcs take their time to unfold and slow the story. The whole film feels like a major build-up, leaving long minutes of dialog and story which postpone the action. When this does come, it explodes on screen with all it's glory, although I did miss the 'Wow!' factor I got from watching the f/x on previous X-Men films. Despite the feeling of finality to the series, I wasn't completely swept away, mostly because the film took so much time reaching it's climax, that by the time it got there I was feeling a definite fatigue. Had the action sequences been more spread out during the film, and the plot more fast-paced, this could have been a satisfying and inspiring summer 2006 outing. Instead, we are met with a decent comic book film that has its moments, but lacked the depths and emotions director Brian Singer could have brought with him to the set.",7,8,15,20 May 2006
School of Rock," School of Rock presents: Jack Black in all his comedic and musical glory
","I've always been a sucker for musical films  biographical (Ray, Walk the Line) or straight-out musicals (Moulin Rouge!, Chicago). Alongside that, I'm also a long time fan of the 'inspirational teacher' sub-genre, ever since I tumbled upon Dead Poet's Society way back when I was 13 years old. Understandable, when a movie that mixed both these genres came along, I was more than pleased.School of Rock presents you Jack Black in all his comedic and musical glory. Black plays Dewey Finn, a grown-up who never really gave up on his dreams of making it big in the world of music. However, reality hits on his face when his band kicks him out and his friend's bossy girlfriend doesn't want him lurching around their apartment anymore. Now, Finn has to find a real job to support himself, and figure out a way to participate in a lucrative rock contest without his band. Shortly after, he begins posing as an Elementary School substitute teacher, where he spends his lessons teaching his very gifted pupils how to play rock and roll, appreciate the classic rock monsters, and basically 'stick it to the man'. While this is far from the study material the kids were supposed to be learning, Finn manages to sweep them off their feet (as well as their principle, portrayed by Joan Cusack), and uncover their hidden talent for singing, playing music and writing lyrics while at it. Alas, a lie can only get so far, and with the rock contest approaching, Finn's cover starts to wear off, as it is obvious he is using them to enter the competition.I won't write down what happens next since I don't want to spoil the film. I will, however, strongly recommend watching School of Rock for its uplifting spirit; inspiring plot and soundtrack (one of the best, and most original, of the past decade); for its versatile director Richard Linklater (Before Sunrise, Fast Food Nation) and his remarkable achievement; for Jack Black's powerful and wonderful performance (there's a reason he was nominated for a Golden Globe for this one) and especially  for the young actors and actresses, who steal the show in every seen. Watch out for the adorable kid that plays Summer Hathaway, and for the exploding talent of Maryam Hassan, who portrays Tomika. Now there's a future singer if I've ever seen one!",10,1,1,9 July 2007
Kick-Ass," Was I supposed to enjoy watching an 11 year old kid getting all beat up?
","Sure, many people loved this allegedly realistic (yeah right) comic book film, but I beg to differ. Sure, it had a nice idea in its core (how would comic book characters act in the real world, told through the eyes of a nerdy teenager?). Unforutnaely, it got tangled up in its own web during the second half - when secondary characters took over the screen and turned into a bloody mess which totally forgot the point it sets out to tell.Being more specific, Kick Ass was a movie I found extremely offensive - mostly because of the Hit Girl character. She was cartoonish and unreal, an 11 year-old girl talking and acting like a pretentious adult, which then goes on to beat the crap out of numerous bad guys. Kids aren't supposed to kill people - good or bad. They're supposed to enjoy what little innocence they have left at this day and age. Instead, this character just acts as a parade of everything that's wrong and immoral about today's children (cursing, beating, acting too old for their own good).To top it all - near the end of the film, Mark Strong's character gets back at Hit Girl and gives her a long, hard beating. Aren't there any rules about the way children are portrayed on the big screen? Was I supposed to enjoy watching an 11 year old kid getting all beat up by an adult? If there are rules that prevent underage minors from appearing nude or being sexualized, why isn't there any supervision on the portrayal of violence towards and from minors on screen?",6,6,16,26 May 2010
Moulin Rouge!," A celebration of color and catchy musical numbers which explode unto the screen
","Shortly before there were Chicago and Dreamgirls (and all the others of their likes), there was Moulin Rouge. The film that revived the musical genre and made it relevant once again is a celebration of color and catchy musical numbers which explode unto the screen in a whirlpool of emotions.The plot brings us the story of a turn of the 20th century English poet living in France (Ewan McGregor in one of his best performance), who binds forces with a group of local bohemians, who urge him to write a musical play for the Moulin Rouge, a famous nightclub in Paris. A series of identity mistakes leads him to the Rouge's lead star (Nicole Kidman), who hasn't the faintest idea he is but a poor poet. The music comes in gear frequently across the movie, combining mid to late 20th century pop numbers with the dazzling re-staging of the 1899 France. Kidman and McGregor sing to each other about heart ache, about class differences and about love in a free and better world. When McGregor sings Elton John's 'Your Song' with the stars and moon twinkling behind him, real magic sends vibrations and electricity through the screen and into the viewer's heart. In fact, it seems as though Australian director Baz Luhrmann did such a great job this time around, he didn't shoot another film since (check his IMDb credentials for confirmation). Now if that's not putting your whole heart and soul to a love product, I don't know what is.",9,1,2,13 April 2007
The Illusionist," Ed Norton is back with a bang
","After several years of saving a lower cinematic profile, Academy Award nominee Edward Norton (Primal Fear, Fight Club) came back with a bang during 2006. In The Illusionist, Norton manages to create a unique and mesmerizing figure in the shape of the tortured magician Eisenhem, who is torn away from his childhood girlfriend, Sophie (Jessica Beil). Paul Giamatti is wonderful as inspector Uhl, who questions Eisenheim's ethics and methods, as he tries to woo back Sophie from the Crown Prince Leopold, whom which she is currently dating (currently being the 19th century).While the final twist in this film is somewhat week, the movie manages to stay visually stunning nevertheless, largely due to a very sharp cinematographic style by Dick Pope.",8,1,1,21 February 2007

","Like many other people, I was also thrilled upon watching the Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer trailer at the cinema. Similar to numerous people who adore CGI, read the comic books when they were kids and thought the first installment was decent enough to justify a sequel, I was more than willing to get myself ready to be overwhelmed by the mere strength of the eye candy and CGI effects within the film. And then I watched it at a special press screening in Ramat Gan, Israel. To make a long story short, FF2 is not a bad film. I was actually quite entertained throughout wide parts of the film (particularly at the beginning - but more on that later). Problem was, once I stepped out of the theater, I couldn't actually recall anything specific or special about what I have just seen (other than that cool CGI Silver Surfer, that is). It was just so mediocre in terms of plot, direction and acting (somebody really ought to give Jessica Alba some acting lessons a.s.a.p), that I didn't even care enough to remember it. Furthermore, while the original film required some suspension of disbelief, let's just say the plot in its sequel stretches this boundary one step too far, IMO. As I've already mentioned, FF2 actually starts up in quite a promising manner. While Reed (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue (Alba) get ready for their media circus wedding (think Tomkat style - but bigger), strange electronic and climatic disturbances occur across the globe. From here on out, you have this huge build up that pays off about half an hour into the film, continues with a bang and some dazzling CGI shots, and suddenly ends abruptly while the initial novelty of the Silver Surfer's appearance wears off. As usual, Chris Evans as Johnny Storm steals the show as the only character to truly evolve during this film, Mike Chiklis as Ben is seriously under-used, my 1.5 year-old nephew could play better than Gruffud's Reed and Alba isn't even that pretty anymore. Then you have all these villains (Silver Surfer is definitely not working alone, as implied in the IMDb official plot line) and some twists and turns that leave you feeling mildly entertained, but also incredibly under whelmed. You see, if you're looking for mindless big-budget fun, this is the place for you and your bucket of popcorn. However, don't expect to find the heart of Spider-Man 3 or epic feel of Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. Don't even look for credible acting or intelligent plot. Only decent thing you'll find are some good looking money shots, and mindless action sequences. This formula of a film may work well as a matinée, but not as something you'll want to come back and watch again in the coming future.",5,184,353,9 June 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Indulges you to seize the day and live life to its fullest, because you never know when it's going to end
","I've waited a long time to see The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and I'm happy to say I was quite happy upon viewing the movie in theaters. Director David Fincher's film follows the story of a man named Benjamin (portrayed by Brad Pitt) that ages backwards: when everyone around him grows older and older, he just keeps growing younger. Cate Blanchett portrays Daisy, his tragic lifelong lover, with Tilda Swinton, Taraji P. Henson and many other talented actors portray various friends, co-workers, love interests and family members he meets along his extraordinary path in life.The movie had lively characters you could relate to, its scenery was breathtaking, and it all came down to its original concept, a concept that made the film so special to me. Its time-twisting elements made you think about how life is fragile and how it keeps slipping away, and how we can never escape our mortality - no matter how far we go. Benjamin Button was growing younger in body but older in heart, and when he faced his aging friends and family, you couldn't escape thinking how lonely he must be (going through the opposite process and all) and how random life is.But instead of taking you to a depressing conclusion, the film wrote itself out like a marvelous feast for life. Even the setback - the story being told to a dying Daisy amidst the upcoming Katrina Hurricane - gives one a new perspective on life, and indulges you to seize the day and live life to its fullest, because you never know when it's going to end.From director Fincher (Fight Club, The Game, Panic Room), I found The Curious Case of Benjamin Button to be a great film with marvelous settings, excellent performances and a versatile cast. It's smart, unique, original, and has an extremely well executed high-concept. After a long wait, I'm happy to see the film get the respect it deserves - both at the box office and by the Academy.I gave it 10 points out of 10.",10,2,5,23 January 2009
Men in Black II," Solid, entertaining sequel with magnificent eye-candy
","On one of the coolest looking sequels ever, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones find themselves back in action as secret agents J and K, protecting the Earth from the scum of the Universe. Just like part 1, the theme song ('Black Suits Coming') makes you move your feet, the effects are top notch (the miniature galaxy inside the locker, the subway-eating worm, the post office workers etc.), and the general feel just make you smile. Sure, its nothing too deep or too inventive as the first one  but it's a solid, entertaining sequel with magnificent eye-candy nonetheless and a hell of a time at theaters (first) and on DVD (later). 'Let me see you nod your heads (black suits coming)'",10,9,17,15 March 2007
Million Dollar Baby," A film that doesn't give in to the rules of the genre, and stays loyal to the story and the characters instead
","Unfortunately, it seems as if two-time Academy Award winner Hilary Swank is one of the least famous actresses who managed to win the prestigious Oscar trophy twice during the course of the years. I say so in great sorrow, as I believe Swank is part of an elite list of modern-day actresses who truly lives up to the definition of acting. And boy can she act! Swank has that special ability to absorb herself into the role she's playing. If she's the androgynous victim in Boys Don't Cry, the nerdy cashier in the overlooked 11:14 or the powerful underdog boxer in this case  she'll always become the character and deliver a powerhouse, emotional draining, performance.Anyway Million Dollar Baby, Clint Eastwood's little boxer film that could, became a surprise Academy Award best picture winner back in 2005, beating Scorsese's wonderful The Aviator. The plot itself, much like the film and its lead actress, tells the story of Maggie Fitzgerald, a female boxer (Swank) who rises from her trailer-park life and become a professional fighter against the odds, with the help of her devoted manager, Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) a washed-up trainer who has seen much better days. However, this isn't your average boxing film. Unlike Rocky, Cinderella Man and others of the genre, its final twist is truly unpredictable, and will most likely leave you pondering for days after watching the film. Either way, I found it different in the right kind of fashion. It's a film that doesn't give in to the rules of the genre, and stays loyal to the story and the characters instead. Since it did that and still managed to gross over 100 million dollars in the North American box office alone, I would call it a remarkable achievement for the human spirit.",9,5,7,3 July 2007
Garden State," Managed to move me in a time and place I really needed it
","Garden State is an emotional shattering ride which is worth several repeat views, in my honest little opinion. The few characters in the film display numerous personality flaws we all carry inside ourselves in some form or another: the guy who can't express his feelings, the girl who can't stop lying, the dude looking for excitements while working at a funeral home. Yet somehow, during their journey, these young characters (all in their mid 20's) manage to find perfection, love and new found strength in the weirdest of places. Kudos go to Zach Braff and Natalie Portman for their convincing portrayals, that succeeded in moving me in a time and place I really needed it. Now, if you drop into this equation a whisker of fine pop music and some dramatic climaxes, you've got the grasp of troubled youth in the 2000's on the silver screen. Bravo!",10,0,1,23 February 2007
Shrek 2," Puss in Boots steels the show whilst Shrek strengthens his reign over kiddy land
","How could you possibly continue a kiddy animated film that ended on a 'happily ever after' note? Show the audience what happens next. The mixture of pop culture references and brothers Grimm mythology will do the rest. And really, how can one stay apathetic when facing the big green ogre  who, despite all his grunts, is adorable as hell? Children aged 0-100 can easily relate to the big guy who just wants to be left alone with his wife in their cuddly swamp home, and for everyone in 'Far Far Away' land to just leave him alone.When legend prepares a different fate for him, Shrek will go through the means to right all the wrongs, and with the help of his loyal friends Donkey and Puss in Boots (one of the most clever interpretations of a fairytale character in my book) he'll get his happy ending  even if it means going against the charming Prince and the evil fairy godmother themselves. While Shrek 2 is a lesser film than the original, which was a comical romp that made me laugh myself silly; the sequel succeeds in reeling you into the imaginative land where giant Gingerbread guys come alive and 'I Need a Hero' becomes a mighty hit once again. Here here.",10,0,1,3 May 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Thank you, Mr. Tarantino
","Amongst the seven films Quentin Tarantino has directed to date, Kill Bill vol. 1 has got to be the most pretentious of the lot. A revenge tale cut into two feature films due to its overlong running time, part one brings us the color and style, whilst part 2, that was released to theaters half an year later, is a much lesser film (in my opinion) that contains more plot and substance, but lacks the fresh and surprisingly stylish cool breath the first installment had to offer.Talking about style, Kill Bill vol. 1 is all over the place. Tarantino quotes Klingon catch phrases, gives out an outstanding homage to 1970's Kung Fu features, mixes it up with anime and an outrageous non-linear story as an intriguing plot device  and covers it all up with one of the best soundtracks ever heard to date. 'Do you find me sadistic?', Bill asks our protagonist, a catatonic bride, beaten to a deadly pulp on the day of her wedding. What Tarantino really wants to know is do we think he's a sadistic fellow himself, teasing us with all these genres, jumping from one end of the plot to another, and probably hailing to himself all the while 'I've done it! I'm a genius!'So yes, Mr. Tarantino, you are a genius. Taking a semi 'been there-done that' story of a vengeful Bride out on a murderous rampage to avenge her near death experience after spending four years in a coma, and turning it into solid gold, is not an easy task to live up to. There were some Tarantino films where I really couldn't understand where he was going with the story. In this case, the plot is very clear even with all the continuity issues and each of the actors shine in their respective roles. Tarantino created a whole new world of organized crime on screen, carefully crafting the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad from colorful characters, with fine actresses like Lucy Liu and Darryl Hanna giving out gorgeous performances. But all these superlatives can't be enough to describe the extravagant nature of Uma Thurman's portrayal of the aching, humane, vengeful Bride.Watch out for the training scenes with Sony Chiba's Hattori Hanzo, the Bride's final battle against the Crazy 88 (I've never scene so many limbs chopped off in such an artistic manner; even the horrific sprays of blood seems choreographed right down to the very last one), and the dramatic opening scene, which shows us the Bride taking the bullet that put her into the coma, seconds after confessing to Bill who's the father of her unborn child. Once the credits started to roll and Nancy Sinatra's 'Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)' started playing in the background, I was hooked. Thank you, Mr. Tarantino.",10,0,3,23 July 2007
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," At times more satisfying then the endless amounts of chocolate displayed on screen
","Tim Burton does it again in this clever and visually stunning adaptation to Roald Dahls' classic children book. Using his regular actor Johnny Depp as the misunderstood Willy Wonka, and re-teaming him with child star Freddie Highmore (following the touching bio-drama Finding Neverland), this new version receives that unique quirky feeling Burton creates again and again in his marvelous films. Being a man of vision and style, Burton paints the screen with surreal visions, showing us devilish squirrels and dangerous chocolate streams inside the spectacular Wonka mansion. As always, all this would never work without the pounding heart of the film  the story of two lonely soles finding friendship in the least expected place.Not to spoil the plot for anyone, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory tells the story of a little boy (Highmore) who along with several stereotypic kids wins a golden ticket which will grant him a tour in the mysterious chocolate factory run by the eccentric Willy Wonka (Depp). The tour quickly takes on a sinister turn, as the various children get punished for their sins (think of a children version for Saw or Se7en). If you want to know what happens next, put your hands on a rental quick  this entertaining ride feels like a lucid dream and is at times more satisfying then the endless amounts of chocolate displayed on screen.",9,0,2,3 May 2007
The Hangover Part II," Just as outrageously messed-up as the first Hangover. Let the good times roll!
","I recently caught up with Hangover II during an early press screening held in Tel Aviv, Israel, and it was by far one of the best films I've seen all year - and most definitely the best comedy. After being horribly disappointed by The Dilemma, grinned occasionally at Hall Pass and Just Go With It (but not really carried away by either), it was about time we got a decent 2011 comedy - and here it is.Plot wise, Hangover II is more of the same from what we've got in the first installment. A lot of main themes and characters from the first film return in different forms, and there are a lot of nods to the aforementioned 2009 mega-hit.However, I will say this. It seems as if the writers knew that the concept isn't as fresh as it was in the first film. So instead, they went for sheer shock value. As a result, some of the things our guys run into during their mess-up in Bangkok are so controversial; I was surprised they were even allowed to show it on screen. Prepare yourself for a lot of in-your-face humor, awkward nudity and misplaced violence.Also, the dynamics between the main protagonists were believable and hilarious. You get to learn more about the characters, and you actually feel like you really know these guys and care for them, after hanging out with them during the first film. The Bangkok location also opened up a whole new world of possibilities and mishaps for our characters to run into, and at one point things turn so crazy I just couldn't stop laughing.Oh yes, there's a plot to explain briefly. OK. So this time, it's Stu's wedding and instead of going to Vegas the whole gang winds up in Thailand. You see, after ditching his bossy girlfriend from part one, Stu ended up with this incredibly hot Asian American, and they decide to hold her wedding in her homeland. So Phil, Alan, Doug and Stu all hop on a plane across seas. The night before the ceremony, the guys decide to go out for a drink, and take the brides' young teenage brother, Teddy.The next morning, they wake up with another of their infamous hangovers. This time, they are somewhere in Bangkok, and it's not Doug that's gone – it's the adolescent Teddy. Instead of a baby, there's a monkey in the room, Stu had a Mike Tyson style tattoo, Alan's hair is shaved and somehow Mr. Chow from the first film is there.There. I won't say no more. But I promise you this – go watch this film in the right state of mind, and you'll laugh yourself silly. While not as refreshing as the first one, the Hangover II does deliver a fun, memorable time at the movies, and that's all I really wanted.",9,159,306,25 May 2011
Big Fish," In the bottom line, anyone who's ever lost a parent would automatically relate to the sentimental and ever so touching nature of Burton's Big Fish
","Big Fish is director Tim Burton's most mature film to date, taking his regular fantasy elements and vivid imagination, and planting them in an adult environment, where they can be both visually entertaining and emotional shattering. And yes, the film is that good.The story revolves around Ed Bloom (Albert Finney), a dying father who receives a surprise visit from his estranges son, Will (Billy Crudrup) while on his death bed. Ed has the tendency of telling tales of his past, most filled up with imaginative figures and mythical places. Will speaks with his father and asks him to retell the story of his life (a major part of the film is told in flashbacks, where the marvelous Ewan McGregor of Star Wars and Trainspotting fame portrays the young Ed). While listening to his father's gripping autobiography, Will tries his best to overcome his overlong cynicism and doubt towards the tales, and try his best to separate fact from fiction  a task he finds particularly hard to accomplish.In the bottom line, anyone who's ever lost a parent (unfortunately, I lost both) would automatically relate to the sentimental and ever so touching nature of Burton's Big Fish. The film is a moral tale that teaches us the importance of family and nostalgia, and emphasizes the sad truth that sometimes we really get to appreciate and understand what we have when it's too late. When the movie ended, and the credits started to roll, I really wished I would've known my own father better (he passed away when I was 9 years old). Honestly, why this film didn't race for the big Academy Awards of 2004 (for 2003 releases) is way beyond me, since this is purely one of the more complex and layered dramas of the 2000's.",10,3,4,9 July 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Enter with an open mind and heart
","The dynamic duo Kaufman/Gondry (writer/director in respective rolls), filled with inventive ideas as always, tackle a delicate texture of our romantic lives. This time around, they go after those fragile moments of love and tenderness we each seek after for years of our existence  and ask what happens when those seem to end or simply slip away. Mixing humor, science fiction and a heart breaking soundtrack (try and listen to Beck's version of 'I Need Your Loving' and tell me you didn't cry), Gondry managed to tame the ever so wild Jim Carey, who in return delivered one of his best performances to date  tied up there with his portrayal of Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon. In case that's one too many Kaufman's for you folks at home, Eternal Sunshine also offers stunning performances by a vary of esteemed actors and actresses, including Kirsten Dunst (Spider-Man), Elijah Wood (Lord of the Rings), Tom Wilkinson (In the Bedroom), Mark Rufallo (Collateral)  and the ever so adoring and lovely Kate Winslet (Titanic, Finding Neverland).

How to Train Your Dragon," The best 2010 release I've seen so far – and one of the best animated films to hit theaters in a very long time
","I remember watching the adorable Disney flick Lilo & Stitch at the theater back in the summer of 2002, after a truly exhausting week. The film - which tells the story of a small girl that befriends a wacky alien she mistakes for a dog - managed to put an enormous smile on my face, and made me forget of all my other worries for a while.While watching Dreamwork's new masterpiece, How to Train Your Dragon, I couldn't help but think about the similarities between both it and the aforementioned Lilo & Stitch. Toothless, the lead dragon character from the new film resembles the alien Stitch in shape as well as in behavior. Hiccup, the main human character which befriends Toothless despite warnings from his fellow Vikings, is a semi middle-age teenage version of the character Lilo. A trip visit to IMDb cleared things up for me - Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, the same people who directed the 2002 wonder (L & S) are behind the new and awesome How to Train Your Dragon.Fortunately enough, the similarities end here, and this is not a carbon copy of that film - even though the bottom line (tolerance toward people who are different, etc.) is the same. However, this new film takes place in the middle ages, in a small village which is repeatedly attacked by seemingly vicious dragons. Stoick (voiced by the almighty Gerard Butler) is the head of the village, a pumped up manly Viking who leads the counter-attacks against the fierce dragons. His teenage son, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), however, doesn't quite fit in. Unlike the older Vikings, who speak in an Irish accent, he sounds like your average American teenager. He's also skinny and small and not exactly the material Viking warriors are made of.After a nightly battle between Vikings and dragons, Hiccup discovers Toothless, a supposedly lethal dragon, which has lost its ability to fly after being injured in the fight. Without anyone knowing, Hiccup slowly gains Toothless' confidence, and the two gradually learn to know each other. After the primal fears disappear, they realize they actually have a great deal to learn about one another – and that friendship is always better than hostility. Soon enough, Hiccup trains Toothless and learns how to approach dragons in general, something that doesn't quite fit in with his father, friends, and the society he lives in in general. But when a greater threat reveals itself, the Vikings and the dragons discover their only hope is to put aside their prejudice thoughts and fight together – with Hiccup and Toothless being their best hope for victory.Bottom line – How to Train Your Dragon is a major victory for the guys at Dreamworks. The film is truly inspiring, with a story that feels self-contained and complete, one that doesn't need to rely on pop culture references to succeed (unlike many of their other products). After a long period of mediocre products (in my opinion) that pale next to their Pixar counterparts, Dreamworks Animation finally came out with the winning formula – which contains just the right amount of relatable characters and true emotions, stunning visuals (including Nordic landscapes and various species of beautiful dragons) and a 3-D element (that uses InTru technology) that really works for a change.Despite the similarities to Lilo & Stitch, I came out feeling that Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders actually managed to improve on their winning hit, and create the best 2010 release I've seen so far – and one of the best animated films to hit theaters in a long long time.",10,17,27,27 March 2010
Inside Man," Plot holes and weak twists aside, Inside Man just reeks 'coolness' however you look at it...
","After attending it's press premiere here in Tel Aviv, Israel, the best thing I can say about Inside Man (2006), is that it's a very, very cool film. Plot holes and weak twists aside, this film just reeks 'coolness' however you look at it. From the extremely stylish opening credits with the shaky camera movements, the brisk New York scenery and the uplifting Indian music; onto the powerful performances by Denzel Washington, Clive Owen (which just gets better and better every film) and veteran actor Christopher Plummer, and up until that moment where the plot finally unfolds and the Indian music starts rolling again - Inside Man is a fun, if unsatisfying, roller coaster ride. That being said, the only obvious conclusions one can assume after watching this film is that A) Spike Lee has once again proved his well achieved acknowledgment for being a very talented director, and B) he did the best he could given the subject material he was given. Oh, by the way, two time Academy Award winner Jodie Foster and two time Academy Award nominee Willem Dafoe also appear in this film, and give excellent performances at that, although their screen time is very limited, and makes you wonder if it was worth their efforts or not.For those who insist on plot details, take in mind that it's hard describing it without giving away potential spoilers, but I'll do the best I can. The film starts by presenting us Dalton Russell (Owen), a bank robber who confesses in front of the camera about his part in leading an extremely elaborate scheme he had recently pulled off with the help of some colleagues. What he exactly robbed, how he did it and why, is where the real fun begins. Because most of the characters in Inside Man are not what they may seem, and you'll find yourself not really knowing which side to cheer for when the curtain comes up. In the meanwhile, we flash back to the moment the scheme initiated, where we find Owen and his fellow robbers taking over a Chase Manhattan branch in Manhattan, New York. Keith Frazier (Academy Award winner Denzel Washington) is a NYPD cop who takes over the situation, trying to negotiate with Russell to retreat from the bank, where a hostage crisis quickly begins. But Russell isn't the ordinary criminal. He takes his time, doesn't seem to keen on robbing the place's assets and has all sorts of weird and unrealistic demands from the negotiation team. In comes Madeleine White (Foster), a very mysterious middle-woman who is sent to the scene by the bank's head of trusties, with a strange agenda of her own. Yeah, I know it sounds cool on the outside, but don't be tricked too quickly  the whole point of this motion picture is to look, sound and feel cool. The resolution is interesting, yet nothing we haven't seen before. If you're looking for a major resolution or for an original idea, don't get your hopes too high. But if you're looking for harmless fun, superb acting and rhythmic direction, and can skip some used ideas; you'll find Inside Man to be a fun ride in the theaters, and a tad bit better than your average matinée.",7,7,10,14 March 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Forget the critics, watch the movie and judge for yourself!
","Coming into the film, I knew there would be many moments where the term 'suspension of disbelief' would come into hand. Although I must admit I never got through reading the entire book (mostly because of my intense life style that leaves me with minimal free time), I knew the basic plot line, including the big secret that the Da Vinci code protects. What I didn't know was the sheer magnitude of writer Dan Brown's conspiracy theory, which crosses time and land and provokes an intriguing discussion about the authenticity of the foundations on which our religions stand. Sure, many of the 'facts' that are claimed throughout the film are not necessarily true, but the slight possibility that it is plausible is what makes it even more entertaining and interesting to view.For those of you who don't know what the film is about (are there any?), Da Vinci Code tells the story of the mysterious murder of a curator in the famous Louvre museum in current day France. World acclaimed Harvard Symbolistic, Robert Langdon (two time Academy Award winner Tom Hanks), is called in by the local police to help investigate the case, using his academic skills to connect the clues left in the murder scene in order to find out why the curator was killed. From there on, starts an intense chase throughout Europe which goal is to untangle the startling truth behind the murder and unleash a secret kept for centuries. Joining Langdon is French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu (French actress Audrey Tautou from 'Amelie' fame), which helps Langdon escape evil forces who are after him, whilst struggling to uncover the religious secret that lies beneath what may well be 'the biggest cover-up in human history'.I won't say anything further about the plot since I don't want to spoil the fun for any of you, but I can say this  the movie is very loyal to the novel, both in premise as in spirit, which is a rarity these days. For those of you who read the book, I can promise you will not be disappointed. However, for those who didn't, beware: some of the revelations are quite talky and less intense than your usual Hollywood fare, so I can see how many viewers may loose their patience from time to time. Alas, there are still some very suspenseful scenes throughout the flick, and if you can forgive a cinematography that is less than perfect (despite the beautiful scenery the plot has to offer, the camera work was anything but inspirational); you will thoroughly enjoy Da Vinci Code. Concentrate on the ideas the movie brings to life, on the fine acting by supporting actors Paul Bettany ('A Beautiful Mind', 'Dogville') and Sir Ian McKellen ('Lord of the Rings' trilogy, 'X-Men' trilogy), on the predictable-yet-enjoyable twists and turns the story has to offer  and believe you me, you will be having a good time.Honestly, I didn't expect for anything else than the aforementioned details, so believe me when I say I'm having a hard time understanding what the critics were so upset about. For me, this is a classic example of the everlasting dissonance between viewers and critics worldwide.I give Da Vinci Code a very satisfying 9 out of 10!",8,3,9,20 May 2006
The Matrix Reloaded," I found the whole freedom of will discussion thought-provoking, and an admirable addition to the intelligent nature of the series
","The original Matrix was a huge hit back in 1999, introducing the world to bullet-time special effects and the creative brothers Larry and Andy Wachowski. We were taught that the world we know does not in fact exist, and that it is a simulation of the late 20th century universe. In reality, it is actually sometime in the 2200's, and machines have taken over mankind, hacking all humans into a parallel universe called The Matrix, to prevent them from resisting and making them believe in a false reality. However, a prophecy speaks of one man (Neo, an icon character, portrayed by Keanu Reeves) who will free humans from the Matrix. That film also introduced us to Neo's arch-nemesis, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), a menacing villain who is sent by the machines to stop Neo inside The Matrix, but eventually goes rogue after Neo overcome him.Naturally, with such a set up, the world was uptight so see what will come next in the Matrix universe. The first installment left viewers anticipating (and not always satisfied), and the box office success of that film led up to The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolution (parts 2 and 3 of the sci-fi trilogy) being filmed back to back en route to their hyped up release back in 2003. The results, however, were a mixed bag with audiences. While Reloaded was a box office smash with over 280 million dollars of receipts on the domestic side alone, Revolutions, which was released later that year earned less than half than that. People claimed Reloaded was too contrived for its own good, and that Revolution's final conclusion was a far cry from what they have expected. Personally speaking, I had a blast watching both sequels, and think that the original film just set a bar that was way too high for any film to stand up to. I, for one, was happy with what I got.The Matrix Reloaded tells us about an upcoming attack of the machines on Zion, the last human pocket of resistance. Neo must ultimately find the architect, the computer program that is responsible for The Matrix, in an attempt to prevent this attack. Meanwhile, he is haunted by visions of a dark faith awaiting his beloved Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) and is encouraged by Morpheus (Larry Fishburne) to live up to the prophecy. During his mission, Neo encounters a new revelation that might shake the foundations of the Matrix before the humans do: computer programs who feel emotion, be it hatred by Mr. Smith or lust by Persephone. The movie was received with much doubts by fans and critics, as it is a more spiritual and philosophical journey than its predecessor. While many thought the questions aroused regarding freedom of choice and freedom of will were mainly boring and pretentious, I found the whole discussion thought provoking, and an admirable addition to the intelligent nature of the series. I also don't understand the yakking about lack of action  the car chase sequence with the twins and the multiple-Smith battle sequence were some of the best action scenes yet to grace the screen.",9,3,5,14 July 2007
The Fountain," The Fountain fills you with life and emotion and doesn't leave you apathetic in your seat
","Welcome to the lucid, dreamy, drugged up world of Darren Aronofsky. If you've seen Requiem for a Dream and/or Pi, welcome back. Aronofsky's world is a creepy place to be in if you're not in the right mood, so my first advice would be to just let go. The Fountain is told in a non-linear, rarely coherent manner. Like Requiem, it jumps from sequence to sequence like a rushed up video clip, shows you the lowest depths of human nature – but unlike its predecessor, it also has an upside in tempo, in the final, somewhat optimistic message, and in general feel.Without getting too much into details (it would just ruin the whole thing), i'll sum the plot up by saying it deals with a love story that spans over 1,000 years (the first occurring somewhere circa 1,500 a.d., the last around 2,500 a.d. and the main one told in current time). In the main arc, Hugh Jackman plays a tortured doctor seeking treatment to his ill wife's sickness (Academy Award winning actress Rachel Weisz), and finding a possible cure in the form of the mythological fountain of youth. Throughout the various plots, it is evident that our protagonist is not willing to give up his love without a vicious, courageous struggle against death and eternity. The final build up is also very satisfying, as Aronofsky makes his way toward the ending in a similar crescendo fashion with which Requiem for a Dream ended as well.

Mr. & Mrs. Smith," You can fight off villains and pull international operations off your sleeve; until you handle the risks of married life, you ain't seen nothing yet!
","In the end of the day, 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' is a classic Hollywood production: big guns, fast paced action sequences, lots of punch lines that'll thrill the audience, and two stunningly beautiful lead actors (who somehow remain beautiful, despite all the mass destruction going around them throughout the second half of the film). The pre-release buzz regarding the dynamic duo's on screen chemistry is absolutely true: as a pair, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are even more sparkling and charismatic then when they are apart (on screen wise, I mean; don't know what's happening off-screen). As a matter of fact, I could have sworn I actually saw them shining during several parts of the film. Add that to director Doug Liman's unique, if controversial, directing techniques (with many of the stylistic action scenes followed by melodramatic music and sharp camera movements) - and you've got yourself a certified crowd pleaser, and the best action film to come on screen... well, since Liman's 'The Bourne Identity' three years ago.The plot, for those of you who haven't already read about it in almost every form of magazine or internet site, revolves around a seemingly normal married couple: John (Pitt) and Jane (Jolie) Smith. The Smith's have been married for several years now, but apparently lost their initial passion to each other, replacing it with what seems to be chronicle marriage fatigue. What they don't know, is that underneath their upper-class and dull daily routine of troubled marriage, lies a secret waiting to explode: both of them are highly skilled deadly assassins, working for rival agencies. Of course, neither of them knows what the other's occupation really is, what only widens the gaps threatening to destroy their relationship. A mission gone wrong on both sides leads them to discover they are not working alone... and that their component, whom they now have to eliminate, has been sleeping beside them for the past five, maybe six, years! From here on out, 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' turns into an intense, action-packed, cat and mouse chase, as the prince and princess of modern-day Hollywood turn their guns (hidden in extremely nonchalant hideouts inside their house) - at each other. The last half hour offers the viewer some of the most stunning examples of why I love Hollywood so much, as pure mayhem conquers the screen, with bigger than-life action fragments (the best i've seen since the original 'Matrix' back in '99), catchy one-liners thrown to the air, waiting to be quoted by movie buffs who'll come in droves to watch this, and intriguing (yet somewhat predictable) plot twists lurking at each turn of the script. It's hard to go into details without spoiling the film for those who are intending to watch it, but I can easily say that I, for one, was very pleased with the final result. Liman directs this summer fare with heart and style, always a lethal combination. Although many will claim it is an emotionally drained vehicle, only good for it's large-scale destruction sequences, one can easily relate to the marriage crisis the heroes are handling, proving that (as Liman said in an interview I read) you can fight off villains and pull international operations off your sleeve; until you handle the risks of married life, you ain't seen nothing yet! Clocking in at nearly 120 minutes, there are some obvious 'dead moments' throughout the film, especially after the excellent beginning and somewhere towards the middle (before all cinematic hell breaks loose). What saves these moments from crucially sabotaging the film's experience is the numerous cynical remarks the Mr. & Mrs. keep throwing at each other. At times, they are so cute, you just want to pause the film, cross the screen into the movie, and give them both a big hug. This is, by far, one of the best on screen pairings I have ever seen; where the relationship part of the film feels a lot like the 1979 classic 'War of the Roses', and the action will even make the almighty Jerry Bruckheimer gaze at the screen with envious eyes. Another positive angle in the film is Vince Vaughn's character, Eddie, the comic relief of the film, who plays Pitt's long time business buddy and best friend, in a parodic appearance that sheds new light on Vaughn's portrayal of Norman Bates in the 1998 remake of 'Psycho'.All in all, 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' is made up of all the right ingredients to turn it into a classic action piece, one that could be watched over and over again throughout the years, and yet stay fresh and entertaining as it is today. True, this isn't the most intelligent or thought-provoking movie I have ever seen, but it sticks to what it's good that, and for that i'm happy.I gave it a strong 4 out of 5 stars, and a 9/10 IMDb rating.",10,185,365,7 June 2005
The Departed," Martin Scorsese's masterpiece keeps you guessing who are the true good guys and bad guys in your life
","Long before this very-deserving action/mafia picture received the lucrative Best Picture award at the 2007 Oscars, it had a well reserved place within my top 100 of the decade. Mirroring real life, Martin Scorsese's masterpiece keeps you guessing who are the true good guys and bad guys in your life. Underneath the endless clichés that could be told about who to put your trust on, the film also works as a character study, with powerhouse performances by lead actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon, the surprisingly talented Vera Farmiga (who hands out a steaming hot performance as the female interest) and the always superb Mark Wahlberg, who manages to say the word 'f**k' countless time in less than a minute  and still run away with an Academy Award nomination. Incredible.",9,1,2,20 March 2007
The Holiday," The Holiday 2006 - A Brief Review
","Well, anyone can tell you what this film is about (2 30+ year old women - one in US, one in UK - swap houses for two weeks and find love in their respective new vacancy), so here are some fun facts about the film you won't find so easily:1. The movie is not only a romantic comedy, but also a movie about making movies. Be prepared for many inside Hollywood jokes, including surprise cameos by Lindsay Lohan, Dustin Hoffman and others. 2. It' the only movie you'll ever find who shows you (brief) images of the DVD covers of classics such as Gone With the Wind and Jaws, and then show you a library who has the horrific Gigli in it. 3. Watch out for that boom mike that comes in the most inadequate scenes. 4. Two much product placement: I wonder how much Google, Universal Studios, that damn Blueberry palm computer and others put into this thing.The Holiday's negative points (IMO):1. Lack of editing: the film has at least 30 minutes that could have been easily removed whilst keeping the plot intact. Some of the scenes take way too much screen time (the film clocks at over 2 hours - way above average for a romantic comedy). 2. Lack of Jack Black: the guy is supposedly one of the main characters but hardly has any screen time, and becomes an important player in the plot only towards the end. 3. Lack of credibility: when you have Jude Law and Cameron Diaz together with two little girls in one scene, and the girls 'steal' the show from the stars, you know something is wrong. Black and Winslet, on the other hand, were more exciting on screen for me. Black actually shines more than ever in his rather small part, and is cute as a button. 4. Lack of continuinity: the UK and the US plot don't always mush together like the director might have intended originally, and seem like two entirely different films occasionally. Most of all, remember: this is supposed to be light Christmas fluff, so handle it with the right thing in mind. If you ignore all the negaive points I mentioned and simply enjoy the film, you'll be having a blast.",6,2,8,6 December 2006
War of the Worlds," The film excelled in so may other fields  acting, atmosphere, special effects  that I was willing to overlook the usual Spielberg disadvantages
","H.G. Wells's classic tale of aliens invading Earth has been a vital part of pop culture for over 100 years. What started as a sci-fi story back in 1898, was adapted (among other formats) into a radio play (with horrific results) in 1938, a ridiculously dated movie in 1953 and a melodramatic musical in 1978. Each retelling of the story placed the plot and characters in a social and political atmosphere that captured the essence of the period's fears and doubts within the artistic format.With these given facts, it was only a matter of time until the 21st century would see its own popular adaptation of the subject material. Someone had to retell the story while capturing the paranoia and true fright the post-9/11 world has been feeling ever since the notorious terror attacks. When Hollywood chose icons Steven Spielberg (director) and Tom Cruise (actor) to head this remake, a modern classic has been born. After striking lightning once with Minority Report, the creative duo set out to tell the story of an alien invasion from the point of view of a father and his two children, who are trying to find their way to shelter, and security, within the mass mayhem that follows the invasion.Cruise plays Ray Ferrier, a working, divorced man, who witnesses an extra terrestrial attack during what was meant to be another weekend he spent with his kids  son Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and daughter Rachel (the obnoxiously precocious Dakota Fanning). When the alien killing machines evaporate people into thin air while Ferrier runs home to save his children, our flawed hero becomes covered with the dust that was once human beings. Throughout the entire film, we watch him try to salvage his family in a chaotic world. We are never told who the aliens are and we never see generals or politicians handling the crisis. Instead, we are only revealed to the news reports and destruction our heroes encounter. The screen shows us tanks and soldiers running over the hill towards a battle against the alien tripods, but they never take us to the other side of the hill, to show us what's really going on.Watching the movie, I couldn't help but compare the dust Ferrier was covered in with photos from Ground Zero on the day of the attack. The aliens, in my opinion, were sophisticated allegories to the terrorists' threat: we never see their faces until the film is near its end, we never fully understand them; yet they pose a threat to our existence, so we have no alternative then to fight them off.The only thing that truly bothered me was the ending, which was both too sudden and abrupt, as well as overly clichéd in my own humble opinion. But then again, the film excelled in so may other fields  acting, atmosphere, special effects  that I was willing to overlook the usual Spielberg disadvantages (let's face it, the man doesn't know how to end a film) and enjoy the overall view as a haunting mirror to the way our society behaves during this frightening first decade of the 21st century.",10,10,16,7 July 2007
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Some of the best one-liners ever
","The funny thing about Israeli theaters is that they're quite problematic when it comes to Will Ferrell. Since most of the population here is Jewish, a Christmas fare like Elf skipped our theaters; our men prefer Soccer over Football so Kicking & Screaming went straight to DVD as well, and we don't have colleges (we have universities instead; which we usually attend after serving 3 years in the army) so you imagine where I saw Old School. Thank god we at least have Blockbuster to help us catch up on that ever so delighting Ferrell flare.Back to topic, this 1970's set film about the intrigue and innuendo set in the chauvinist world of Anchormen is a completer riot every true comedy lover owes himself. I guess I loved it most because it brings up important themes in a humoristic manner, and because it deals with my profession (journalism). But then again, you can't ignore those hilarious one-liners ('I'm Ron Burgundy?'; 'I love carpet'), and the mega-celeb fight scene with Tim Robbins, Jack Black, Will Ferrell, Luke Wilson and Judd Apattow.",9,1,2,19 March 2007
Inception," I really wanted to like Inception, BUT
","As a longtime fan of the science-fiction genre, I was eagerly anticipating the arrival of Inception come July 2010. It had all the right players in place – with director Chris Nolan hot off the unbelievable success of The Dark Knight, and four of the lead actors cooperating for the first time, after turning in spectacular performances in their previous films: Leonardo DiCaprio (Shutter Island), Ellen Page (Juno), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (500 Day of Summer) and Marilon Cotilard (Nine). In addition, the trailers demonstrated some awesome money shots – mostly the one showing a city folding into itself – with the plot resembling a fantasy world operating within its own set of rules and logic, reminiscent of The Matrix films.However, at the end of the day what I found was a film with an overlong prologue, characters which behaved more like plot devices than as fleshed out personalities, and a lack of true emotion. To top that off – DiCaprio's characters, Dom Cobb, went through a very similar journey to the one his previous character, Teddy Daniels, went through earlier this year, in Shutter Island, with the exception being that I found that film to be more emotionally satisfying.But first let me start with the pros, before diving deeper into the cons. First and foremost, Inception is indeed a visually stunning film; with some strong scenes I could easily watch becoming classics (the floating hallway sequence, Cobb and Ariadne's first foray into the dream world). The editing was top-notch too – with the plot altering between four different dream sequences, each existing within a completely different time frame – without alienating the audience in the process. In addition, the basic premise had a lot of potential, even though I found references to previous cinematic material of its nature.In short, the plot follows Cobb, a person who masters a technology that allows him to penetrate other people's dreams, where he can steal their secrets and use them against them in real-life. Saito, an Asian millionaire (Ken Watanbe), approaches Cobb with an interesting business proposal: he wants him to use these abilities of his, in order to plant a destructive idea inside the mind of Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), the son of a dying businessman that poses a threat to Saito's business. This procedure is called Inception, hence the title of the film. Since Cobb has some serious sub-conscious problems with his deceased wife, who appears again and again in all the dreams he penetrates, he needs to assemble a large team to help him carry on this mission. Complications ensue, and the team finds itself diving from one dream into another.Now, since the plot is relatively complicated and isn't always easy to follow, a large portion of the first half of the film works as a long and elaborated prologue. In fact, Ellen Page's character is bought in to do just that: she's a newbie in this business, so Cobb has to show her the ropes, introducing it to the audience as well. Whenever this internal logic is explained via visual effects, all is good in Inception-land, but at times, it seemed as if there was too much talk and not enough character development. The lack of understandable action continues long after the prologue ends, however, given the fact that there is no apparent 'bad guy' in the film. The team fights off foes that are merely reflections of their own sub-conscious, and while this may offer a visual treat at times, it lacks internal conflict and drama that usually drive films of this nature forward. In the end, after creating one of the strongest villains of all time (The Dark Knight's Joker), Chris Nolan created a film with no bad guys at all. In the absence, one would think he would give the audience a good explanation about the need to plant this idea inside Fischer's mind – which, after all, is the driving force behind the whole film – but no coherent explanation is offered. Was Fischer a bad guy who deserved the complicated turmoil Cobb and his gang put him through? Was Saito wrong in his path to remove his potential business rival? With no straight answers, it seems the team was operating in a permanent state of gray, which raised quite a few moral issues that weren't entirely treated.Instead of addressing these issues, Inception mostly tries to go into Cobb's own dark and mysterious history, by introducing us his sub-conscious reflection of his dead wife, Mal (Cotilard). The problem is that at this point, it just reminded me of Shutter Island too much. In both films, DiCaprio portrays a young man, haunted by his guilty conscience, feeling responsible for his unstable wife's tragic and untimely death, up to the point he finds it hard to distinguish what is real and what is not. Thing is, I actually found Shutter Island better, because his character there emphasizes DiCaprio's wide range of emotion as an actor better. Personally, I thought his performance in Inception as a whole lacked an emotional pull similar to the one he demonstrated in the aforementioned film, which prevented me from connecting with him on that same raw level.At the end, this feeling of plot-recycling (and I'm sure this wasn't Nolan's fault), lack of depth or emotion in certain characters, and indecisive motives for the actions of others – all made me feel like the true brilliance and vision of Nolan's Inception didn't live up to its potential. I gave it 7 stars out of 10.",8,3,13,17 July 2010
Vanilla Sky," 'Tech Supppppoooorrrrttt!'
","Halfway through watching Vanilla Sky, I was willing to let go of the whole damn thing and give up on watching it. The plot jumped from drama to romance to suspense and so on, not giving you too many threads or clues as to what's really going on. Thing is, if you lack the proper patience, you lack the tools to fully realize the masterpiece that director Cameron Crowe has created for us here. Vanilla Sky chronicles the strange events that occur to one David Aames (portrayed accurately by the ever so talented Tom Cruise), a 33 year-old New York playboy, who's lavish lifestyle and reckless behavior is about to take a sudden and extremely violent twist. Aames is the sole inheritor of a publishing company and a real lady's man. After encountering the beautiful Sofia at a party (Penelope Cruz, who also became Cruise's real-life partner for a while at the time this movie hit theaters), David seemingly has a reason to finally settle down and let go of his hectic manners. Unfortunately, that's exactly when reality comes around in the shape of Julie, a hurt and neglected ex-lover who's determined to settle the score with him once and for all  thus denying him the chance of love and happiness he took away from her so abruptly. The jaded lover (Cameron Diaz, in an eccentric and unconventional role) takes David on a highway to hell, driving them both into a tragic car accident. When David wakes up, his face is deformed, his ownership of the company is at risk, and he's haunted by whatever has happened to Julie. Our hero has to grow up and adjust to the harsh reality quickly, or else he'll lose what little he has left. However, adapting to the new status isn't as easy as it may seem. Something has changed in his post-accident life, and he can't quite put his finger on it. Whatever it is, it all comes down to the choices he made after the accident, those turns of fate that now come back to haunt him, thrusting his life into a nightmarish reality  if, indeed, you can call his existence a realityThroughout the film, Tom Cruise plays the tormented David with such accuracy, you really believe he's going through all these highly surreal events. In the end, without spoiling the film entirely, it's all about the way we handle the choices we make in life, and our never ending pursuit after the things we want the most. It's that bittersweet feeling you can always open your eyes and take the other path in life, that also made me return to this film and watch it over and over again throughout the course of the 5.5 years that went by since I first watched it in theaters. In time, I found many comparisons between the film and the general feel of this decade  which Vanilla Sky captures best. When Cruise's David loses his looks and becomes old real fast, it's the filmmaker foreshadowing our need, as a society, to wake up and face our problems instead of running away from them. The mixture of genres also blends well into this theory, as none of us really know how to approach the historical shifts all around us. When David runs through the empty streets and passes the abandoned Times Square, I saw our whole generation seeking for something familiar amidst the cold and aggressive present. Bottom line - after watching hundreds and hundreds of Hollywood products from the 2000's, Vanilla Sky remains one of the most compelling and brilliant films I am yet to have seen this decade. It's an intense and intriguing story from A to Z, which really only makes you understand it completely towards the final quarter of the film, when it shifts into yet another genre - Science Fiction. P.S.: Watch out for one of the most bizarre uses of a Beach Boys song toward the end of the movie, when all things truly go berserk.",10,1,3,20 January 2007
Casino Royale," Starts with a bang, ends with a whimper; A different 007 indeed
","After watching Casino Royale, one cannot escape the conclusion that for better or worse, Daniel Craig is a new kind of Bond, and entirely different from the one Pierce Brosnan portrayed in his 4 films as 007. Craig is a grittier, darker, more arrogant Bond. He plays his role very seriously and lacks some of the self aware irony that Brosnan brought with him to the part. While the latter had lots of charm and was reminiscent of nostalgic 1950's actors, the new Bond represents a 21st century type of masculinity. He's a man of few words, pumped up from head to toe (girls will be drooling all over this guy), and always believes he knows what to do best, even when his supervisor's suggest otherwise. He's pretty similar to TV's Jack Bauer from the hit series '24' for that matter, although what Craig lacks in brain and wit (compared to Bauer), Bauer lacks in body building (compared to the new Bond).This being said, I think Casino Royale was afraid of really letting this new Bond character evolve into the dark hero he could have been. Instead, we get a half baked version of numerous action heroes we've already seen before. The movie itself is much like it's main character - rather indecisive of where it's going and what it wants to do upon getting there.Clocking in at a ridiculously long 144 minutes, the film jump starts with one of the more intense action sequences seen on the silver screen in recent years. Bond chases an African arm smuggler halfway through an African marketplace, into a construction site and onto a foreign embassy. Both guys make insane leaps from one place to the other, hang onto construction equipment while suspended in the air, while explosions that demand suspension of disbelief ensue. This top notch (yet cheesy) action continues through several sequences that start off the film with a bang, each one somewhat calmer than the previous one. Through the African arm smuggler, Bond eventually reaches a French millionaire who benefits financially from various terror acts (this is the first Bond that speaks openly about 9/11 and laughs off the Cold War era). It is during a Casino game that will determine the future of the terror fonds that the film is supposed to peak. However, it just keeps winding down even more-so from there on out. Craig isn't too strong when it comes to the dramatic sequences, and the only dramatic lead that saves some grace is Eva Green (The Dreamers, Kingdom of Heaven), that only appears towards the end of the first 1/3 of the film.To sum it all up, Casino Royale could have been much better had the rest of the movie looked or felt like the beginning. It had all the right ingredients and heaps of potential, both regarding Craig as well as regarding the meanings through which the plot line unfolded in front of the viewer. However, the over-longed romantic scenes, the winding down of the plot and the lackluster climax couldn't compensate for a strange new Bond, which might just take some time getting used to. Also, the lack of Q and his mechanical gizmos, for one, was also somewhat disappointing. There's just so much an audience will be willing to bare.I gave it a 5 out of 10.",7,12,37,13 November 2006
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Ice Age 3 delivers the goods, and appeals to grown-ups and kids alike
","My wife and I attended an early press screening for the third Ice Age installment two weeks ago and had a wonderful time. The film easily tops the second outing of the series, and is right on par with the first - with just the right mixture of new characters and settings vs. the older ones we've all grown to love (especially Scrat. I can watch a whole movie with this guy).This time around, Manny and Ellie are expecting a baby mammoth, something that leads to unexpected responds from Diego and Sid. When Sid decides to become a parent himself in return, he steals three giant eggs he accidentally bumps into, only to later realize they're dinosaur eggs that belong to a pretty angry mother. When mother-dinosaur kidnaps Sid, it's up to Manny and friends to return him home safely. Adventures ensue as they find out that underneath their icy world lives a land filled with enormous and sometimes menacing dinosaurs, one which our friends would need to cross in order to rescue Sid.Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is cute but not insulting, the visuals are stunning and if you forgive the obvious historical loophole (there were no dinosaurs during the Ice Age) you can actually have quite a good time. The dinosaurs add a lot to the plot, and there's actually a very cool, nice sense of adventure throughout the film, one that was somewhat missing (in my opinion) from the previous installment. All this adds to a fun and thrilling experience - alongside the visuals, jokes and general good atmosphere.To sum things up - Ice Age 3 is an above average animated film, that'll appeal to grown-ups and kids alike. I gave it 9 out of 10.",9,94,140,28 June 2009
Before Sunrise," A dreamy stroll through the urban landscapes of Vienna, and a well told classical romantic rendezvous
","I managed to catch a late night double feature last night of 'Before Sunrise' (1995) and 'Before Sunset' (2004), and saw both films in a row, without really having the chance to catch my breath in between or ponder on the meaning of each film separately. After sleeping it over, I have to say that I largely prefer the former over the latter, and I shall explain why.Before Sunrise introduces us with then young actors, Ethan Hawke (Reality Bites, Dead Poets Society), only 25 at the time of the film's release; and Julie Delpy (the Three Colors trilogy), then 26 (although looking much younger). He is a promiscuous American writer, touring Europe after breaking up with his girlfriend; She is a young French student, on her way home to Paris. They meet on the Budapest-Vienna train and spontaneously decide to get off the train together. The two deeply spiritual and intellectual individuals than spend a whole night together walking the beautifully captured streets of Vienna, exchanging ideals and thoughts and gradually falling on love.The film has 1990's written all over it: back then, technology was leaping rapidly, the new millennium with all it's hopes and dreams was waiting just around the corner, and young adults like the ones depicted in the film were filled with love of life and passion for the future. The characters of Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy), with all their flaws and inconsistencies (Celine's accent, if by mistake or on purpose, was half American-half French, and it swinged from one spectrum to the other, breaking the character's credibility), were a mirror of the time. Watching the naive couple swallow life with such meaning and excitement, acting all clichéd and romantic yet managing to have the audience fall for them as well, is what really made this movie work for me. The fact that the director doesn't let you know if their relationship continues after the film or not makes it all even more worth while.All in all, Sunrise is a dreamy stroll through the urban landscapes of Vienna, a well told classical romantic rendezvous, and a film I will definitely return to for further insight sometime in the future.",8,1,2,23 December 2005
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," They finally got it right!
","While never an avid Harry Potter fan, I have watched all eight Harry Potter films on the big screen over the past decade. It's been a long, bumpy ride, with some films stronger than others - mainly the first few (in my own honest opinion). After a while, however, it all felt like the biggest cinematic tease ever. I mean, we've been told about Voldermort ever since the beginning, and we've known all along that the saga will end with this big, epic fight between good and evil... err, I mean Harry vs. Voldermort. However, that never came (except for a few teases here and there), and when the producers decided to postpone the inedible and split the last film into two, it became ever so frustrating.Thanks god, then, that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 came along to right all the wrongs the previous films have made and to give us the proper closure we've all been waiting for. Finally, after all this time, we get to see the main protagonist for more than a glance. We get resolutions to plot lines that began in parts 6 & 7, Hogwarts makes an awesome comeback for one, final stand between forces between both sides, and there are even some twists and turns that echo all the way back to parts 1 & 2.So yes, THIS is the Harry Potter we've all been waiting for all along: edgy, dark, more mature and complex than ever before, with solid performances from all involved (especially Ralph Fiennes, who gets some space to play with his character, and that guy that plays Neville Longbottom, who grew up to become quite a man from that mousy little kid he once was). But more so - and unlike any of the other films in the series – HP7b stands as an independent piece (alongside its 2010 counterpart), and doesn't leave the viewer unsatisfied. Here, we get a proper ending, we know this is the Harry Potter to end all 800 or so films that came before, and it seems that the producers knew this and gave it all they could. I only wish they've done this more often during the previous films, instead of saving the best for last.All in all, this is THE best Harry Potter I've seen from all the eight, and a truly exciting roller coaster of a film, filled with top notch storytelling alongside impressive special effects (even the 3D felt appropriate and relevant). I gave it a very solid 9 out of 10.",9,16,30,11 July 2011
Final Destination," Not your average horror fair
","Reflecting the whole 'terror without a face' reality Americans woke up to on September 11th, 2001; the first Final Destination (released during early 2000) stands as a shocking premonition of things to come - with the main focus on (You guessed it) an Airplane Crash. After a student on a field trip actually has a premonition of this happening during the first minutes of the film, he storms out of the plane, dragging a group of fellow classmates with him. Moments later, the plane lifts off without them  and explodes right after its lift off. However, this was not supposed to happen. You see, Final Destination believes death has a plan for all of us, and if you 'missed the train' the first time around, fate will come after you with a vengeance  combined with a horrible and gruesome death. The rest of the film sees the group of frightened teenagers who survived the crash avoiding the unavoidable  only to face the grim reaper later on in the film. This may sound dumb at first, but the concept of the movie, along with the idea one can actually 'cheat death' is fascinating, IMO. Trust me, these aren't your average horror fairs  they are instant classics, with some of the death scenes (at least in the first part) already part of the horror pantheon for years to come.",10,0,2,7 December 2007
Click," When the usual Sandler light-weighted fare is mixed up with this brilliant premise, there's no boundary for the mere amount of possibilities that unfold
","I'll start out by stating the obvious (well, it will become obvious after you read my review): I am a die hard Adam Sandler fan. It's not that he's a versatile actor (he basically plays himself over and over again) or that he's the most charismatic fellow you'll meet on screen (in fact, you'll usually find him angry and/or upset, stuttering some foul language to himself). However, Sandler does portray the everyman persona in a convincing manner; and does so with a great sense of humor and own unique charm. If you read my Anger Management review, you'll probably put 1&1 together and realize that whatever this man does, I'll love it  and rightfully so.Obviously, things got even easier to relate with when Sandler ventured into my own favorite sub-genre  witty fantasy-science fiction cinematic fair. Venturing even closer, Sandler re-invented the sub-sub genre of 'What if?' sci-fi in Click, a comedy where he again plays the everyman who becomes frustrated with his life. Aha! But what if this working man, who also has two demanding kids and a neglected feeling wife, should find a universal remote control that remote controlled his life? What if he purchased this device from well to fast forward his argues with the Mrs., see 'behind the scenes' from when his parents conceived him and put his irritating barking dog on 'mute'? And  what if all this fooling around with the present will have some unexpected and vast influences on the future? When the usual Sandler light-weighted fare is mixed up with this brilliant premise, there's no boundary for the mere amount of possibilities that unfold as the movie moves on  leaving the audience (that's you, by the way) feeling happy, sad and extremely satisfied. Add in living legend Chris Walken as the sinister salesman who sells Sandler the remote, Kate Beckinsale as the Mrs., and Sean Astin as the wife's alternate love interest  and you're in for a riot.",10,2,4,6 July 2007
Donnie Darko," Promising director Richard Kelly's debut film is a journey of fate, faith and our ability to walk the thin line that separates these two

That... is when the world... will end'  Frank, the giant bunny rabbit (from 'Donnie Darko').When I first learned about Donnie Darko, the film was already a two years cult classic. Of course it was a devastating flop at the box office, so many people didn't know what it was, or what it was about. But when a local Israeli radio station first played Gary Jewel's melancholy adaptation of the pop hit 'Mad World' (taken from the movie's excellent soundtrack), the announcer spoke of a forgotten American film about a kid who encounters a vision of a giant bunny rabbit that tells him that the world is about the end unless he takes some severe actions to prevent it. This all sounded surreal to me, and I decided to do whatever is necessary to put my hand on a copy of the film, and see what it's all about. And boy was I hooked. Jake Gyllenhall, in one of his earliest appearances (long before he started to become somewhat annoying), is Donnie Darko, the haunted teen who takes the impossible burden of fixing the world on his shoulders. Shortly after the film begins, a jet engine falls from a plane and crash lands into Donnie's bedroom. After eluding this freak accident, a sequence of bizarre occurrences revolving Darko begins to take place. Darko is led by his bunny-friend, Frank, to wreak havoc on his home town, supposedly in the interest of saving them (or something). Alas, it is not quite clear who this Frank bunny is, and why Darko is the only person to see him. This whole hallucinatory film takes place during the 1988 presidential election, but if you notice the voices in the background, you'll notice something went wrong with the alternate reality Darko is living in, and it is not the 1988 many of us would remember. Whatever he was trying to pull, promising director Richard Kelly's debut film is a journey of fate, faith and our ability to walk the thin line that separates thee two. Gyllenhall's real life sister and a talent on her own right, Maggie, plays Darko's on screen older sister, and Daveigh Chase (The Ring, Lilo & Stitch) is the younger one. Also taking part in this wonderful indie film are 1980's legend Patrick Swayze (as a child molesting sports coach), Drew Barrymore (as Darko's teacher) and E.R.'s Noah Wyle.If you manage to get your hands on this one, you won't regret it. The film's success is word of mouth in its full pride and glory  and an extremely justified one in this case.",9,2,5,10 July 2007
The Pursuit of Happyness," One of the only films in recent years to have a true heart pounding in the center of it
","Will Smith has proved himself over the years not only to be an undeniable tour de force at the box office, but also a multi-talented mega-star. After excelling in almost every possible genre (Action, Comedy, Animation, Sci-Fi, Romance, etc.), his 2006 mega-hit propelled him to yet another cinematic height  pure old fashioned dramatic acting.In Pursuit of Happiness, Smith portrays Chris Gardner, a single parent with no formal education, who decides to beat the odds and make it big in the world of stock broking  despite (and perhaps even in light) of all the objective facts being against him. One of the only films in recent years to have a true heart pounding in the center of it, the film plays out as an unfolding prayer for the Capitalistic and liberal manner through which the American society evolves. Through that, it also carries one of the sharpest and truthful messages i've ever seen at the cinema  the notion that each and every one of us holds the potential to make it big, even huge, in life, if we only put our honest talents to the task.",10,1,2,24 March 2007
Dodgeball," Sets an extremely high bar for future nonsense comedies
","'Nobody makes me bleed my own blood. NOBODY', White Goodman (Ben Stiller) in Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story.This ridiculous quote (don't bother searching for inner logic within it, you won't find any) is taken from one of the most zany, crude and remarkably dumb movies that were made for the silver screen in recent years. Guess what? The formula, absurd as it is, actually works. With the right cast, inexplicable cameos (Chuck Norris, Lans Armstrong and William Shatner all in one), and just the right amount of grown-up actors who are willing to embarrass themselves at any cost  Dodgeball is the best sports comedy made in the 2000's (miles better than Will Ferrell's overrated Talladega Nights).Dodgeball tells the ludicrous story of a bunch of losers (A high school student with aspirations of becoming a male cheerleader, a man who thinks he's a pirate, a spineless nerd married to a male-ordered Asian wife and more) who work out together in a gym conveniently named 'Average Joes'. The manager of the gym is Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn, in his last pre-Wedding Crashers days), who has an ongoing dispute with one White Goodman (Stiller), the owner of a mega-successful chain of gyms who looks to take over La Fleur's gym as well. La Fleur, who is also in deep financial debts, has to come up with 50 grand as soon as possible, in order to prevent Goodman from executing his devilish scheme. When he and his brethren of losers learn about an obscure Dodgeball competition with a 50,000$ award tag attached, they must learn to play the game fast, and overcome Goodman's competing team in the finals.The movie is very short, and very accelerating (I knew nothing about Dodgeball upon my first view, but hooked up with the rules of the game as the film went along), and pumps you up towards its adrenaline packed finale. The main course, however, is Ben Stiller's character, Goodman. Stiller gives out his best performance to date by portraying Goodman as the dumbest bad guy you'll ever see. The narcissistic head of the competitive chain of gyms is a goofy character, who speaks illogical sentences, often contradicting himself; greases himself up and masturbates with a Pizza slice (don't ask me how this works). Stiller gives Goodman the most outrageous gestures and one-liners I've seen in a while, especially when confronting Vaughn's character on screen; and comes out as a complete arrogant jerk. Stiller's real life wife, Christine Taylor, is the bisexual bank accountant who comes to La Fleur's aid and eventually falls for him (more or less). Taylor and Vaughn's chemistry with Stiller is a definite advantage that helps carry the movie throughout its comedic sequences, setting an extremely high bar for future nonsense comedies.If you love sports and comedies, and you don't get offended easily, Dodgeball is the place to be for relaxation and guilty pleasures.",10,1,2,10 July 2007
V for Vendetta," What's so brilliant about Vendetta is that even though it takes place in this vague future, the resemblance to today's worldwide politics is captivating
","'Remember, remember the 5th of November. The gunpowder, treason, and plot. I know of no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot'  (Hugo Weaving as V, the masked freedom fighter from V for Vendetta).If a person has the ability to change his own path of life, can one person be strong enough to change the course of an entire nation? And besides, who really calls the shots in our society? Is it the decadent and greedy politicians who think no further then their wallets, or is it the people, that elusive entity that presents the collective and unheard voice of the silent public? V for Vendetta takes place in an apocalyptic and futuristic London, a time where the preservative countries have lost their international powers. Great Britain is now ruled by a minority of corrupt leaders who use totalitarian methods to preserve order in the streets and maintain stability of their administration. However, underneath the surface a resistance is slowly rising. The people, it seems, are getting sick of being tortured and bullied around by the street police, and tired of a system that quiets down any attempt of people who think or act differently to raise their head with pride. All this is about to change. In comes one of our two main heroes, a masked vigilante out for justice, who stops at nothing in his attempts to reveal the startling truth behind the government's actions to the British public. Known only as V, his main role model is Guy Fawkes, a freedom fighter who tried to bring down King James I of England way back in 1605. V befriends Evey Hammond, a teenage girl whom he saves from some government bullies (the monologue scene where he presents himself to her, relying mostly on nouns beginning with the letter V, is one of the more admirable linguistic scenes I've ever scene). V brings Evey (portrayed by Academy Awards nominee Natalie Portman) into his life, and gives her shelter in his secluded hideaway. Their mentor-student relationship plays a large part in the film, as does the real reason why V never takes off his mask. Obviously, not much can be said without going into spoilers for those who haven't seen the film, but it's a hell of a roller-coaster ride  both emotionally wise and plot wise  and the big payoff in the end gives this film one of the most breathtaking and satisfying conclusions ever to be seen on film.What's so brilliant about Vendetta is that even though it takes place in this vague future, the resemblance to today's worldwide politics is captivating. It brings up many social dilemmas but ultimately deals with a universal theme almost anyone can relate to  the human spirit and its tendency to prevail, even when it seems that all hope is gone. Granted, V uses terror tactics to get his message out throughout the film, and that may be a tad bit tricky because it may make you agree to these methods under extreme circumstances. However, it manages nevertheless to shout out a strong and important message, one that is timeless at that  that terror, even if institutionalized, can never win against the ultimate weapon: man's deterrence to be free; and that desperate times may require desperate means, even if those should be used only as a doomsday weapon. Directed by relatively anonymous director James McTeigue, it's the film's writers you really ought to be looking out for. The Wachowski Brothers from The Matrix fame are the true people to commemorate for this fine piece of political and philosophical cinema.",10,2,11,28 July 2007
