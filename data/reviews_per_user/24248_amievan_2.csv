10 Cloverfield Lane," Not worthy a sequel to Cloverfiield, bad marketing and broken expectations
","I was one of those people who liked the first film (Cloverfield), and was expecting this one to be a sequel.It is not.The story, tone and pacing are different. This is a very different film. If Cloverfield was a first-person action packed sci-fi, this one is more of a slow paced psychological thriller. And not a good one.I was upset they used the same marketing to push the fans of the first film, into a totally different (and inferior) experience. Not cool.As a film on its own, it has important flaws which just turn it into a mediocre flick. It feels flat, uneventful... nothing really happening throughout most of the movie.The only real suspense I ever had, was the expectation of the thrills of the first film. But they weren't there.",4,8,14,8 May 2016
Zootopia," Average movie carried mostly by great visuals
","Zootopia (in a summary) tells the story of a character whose ambitions do not fit well in the world she lives in.If that sounds clich√©, then you would be right.The movie also takes on the (heavy) task of delivering messages around racism, acceptance, and fear of the 'different'.Unfortunately, the movie under-delivers on both the story line, and the depth & impact of its messages.The protagonist's optimism and resilience is not justified when *everyone* is depicted to be pushing against her dreams, including her parents. Worse still, the story collapses when a typical cheap/easy element is added in, to resolve the build up. It's as if the screenwriters spend all their effort and wit building a story up (easy), and have none at all left when it comes to resolving to a satisfactory conclusion (always the hard part).On the positive side, the tone of the movie is cheerful, with great artwork and visuals.",6,1,6,23 May 2016
