The Incredible Hulk," Hulk fans will be happier now.
","In my opinion, the first Hulk movie in 2003 wasn't all that bad. However, I went to see it with very high hopes and expectations, and left feeling unfulfilled. I didn't like the new origin story and I hated how The Hulk kept getting bigger - he was like 25 feet tall! There were good action scenes when Hulk fought the army, but Bruce Banner's dad as the villain at the end was just strange and boring.This time around, I think the formula is better...a little less drama and a lot more action. The Incredible Hulk also had a better villain in The Abomination. The action and fight scenes were terrific and a great cast complemented a well-written story. It seemed more like the Hulk in the comics which made for a much better movie. I also enjoyed the nods to the old Incredible Hulk TV series. The pace of this film is pretty fast and the feeling is more tense and exciting than the first movie, which was kind of slow and dramatic.The Incredible Hulk is definitely worth the price of admission. Hulk fans and general action movie fans will really enjoy it. I took my very uninterested girlfriend with me and she even said she liked it. As far as comic book movies go, I think only the Spider-Man movies (other than the 3rd), Iron Man and Batman Begins edge out The Incredible Hulk. Hopefully it does well so Marvel will make some sequels.",8,3,5,18 June 2008
