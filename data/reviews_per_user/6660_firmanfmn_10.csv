Scarface," Nearly perfect
","Al pacino amazing in here ,like hes amazing in dog day afternoon,this movie revolve around Al pacino character,to bad the side character not as memorable as his ,i mean what Michelle pfeifer character does ?nothing, she just prize woman without depth at all its couldve been better",8,1,2,11 June 2019
Gravity," Breathtaking
","It hits u fast and pull u on the edge of your seat.Gravity will makes u hard to breath and thats a good thing ,the cinematography is awesome makes u feel as afloat in the space with the character.I'll give it 10 star if they give a complete subplot for George clooney character instead just kill him off .",9,3,5,6 April 2019
Us," It was ok,not what i expected
","'Us' is second on Jordan peele directorial features ,having watch Get out i have a high expectation for this one,but turn out dissapointed ,maybe im setting my expectation to high i dont know,Jordan peele having a hard to take this story ,theres so much incosistency whether it gonna be scary or funny,im surprised by the amount of comedic moment in this and checking this page its said horror & thriller it looks like they forgot to write comedy cause thats what half of this movie is,its really ruined it for me.It got a good cinematography 20 minutes in that amusement park shoot is good,the biggest problem of this movie is plot holes and 'The twist' that we knew it coming and didnt leave me with open mouth or anything,i think Jordan peele take Shymalaman movies refference to serious.US got alot good scary and tense moment as well ,but far from being horror movie of the year such as 'Hereditary' or Peele predecesor 'Get out'",6,2,2,22 March 2019
Juno," Adult topic with teen package
","Juno is movie about teenage girl that get pregnant and how she dealt with it affect her relationship with people she love.Juno is a adult topic in a package of teenage movie ,at first i thought this movie gonna be rom com but turn out it talks about deep issue 'abortion' around a teenage girl played by Ellen paige.Juno is well told with a wit dialogue and wit characters.I reccomend to watch this if u like funny dialogue and weird dialogue and Michael Cera",7,0,0,7 April 2019

Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Better than Homecoming?
","I luv Miles morales ,i thought first hes gonna way more different than Peter parker,but turns out he just not share shooting web but also Peter goofy and clumsiness.
The animation its so unique so comical and yet it feels so alive,the story its good but not amazing ,its just fit with the tone and what this movie about, which is fun.Aunt may badass in here ,shes like Alfred pennywise to Batman,guarding cave and making suit and stuff.Gwen is lovable and the other character is just fit in and support Miles so well.The best Spiderman animated so far,maybe more fun than Homecoming i can say.",9,3,13,15 December 2018
Yesterday," Opportunity missed
","Its a shame with such an interesting premise this movie set up,they cant come up with the solution of the problem that comes up with it,how the physicall beatles proof record etc suddenly missing all over the worlds? Why John lennon alive and Paul and Ringgo whereabouts not even mention by him?how music world without the beatles influence? Why coca cola missing but Pepsi not,are this movie sponsored by Coca-cola competitors?why they need to erassed harry potter ?cause it nt improve the plot or whatsoever just used comedic that fell flat.",5,1,7,29 June 2019
City of God," God left this city
","City of god tells a story of 'Rocket a slum boy who wants to be photographer,but caught up in a war between rival gang in the city of god'Its been a long time for me to watch this movie,since theres so much good praise about it and sitting on a 100 top imdb list,and im not disapointed, City of god its unique and well written story based on real story that happens in Brazil with the exact same location in the City of God . I watch some of the clip before watching this movie,i watch the clip in youtube where Lil Z confront this kid and then shoot their feet,back when i watch it i didnt know the story or the context of whats going on and it makes me feel sorry for the kid and it feels so unreal watch it back then,but when i watch the movie now i kind feel different ,like less sorry for the kids after knwoning what they do, anyway back to the review,the cinematography is something else its zhame they didnt won oscar for it,the acting is on spot .Its amazing movie def gonna see it for a second time.",9,1,1,6 January 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," watch out
