The Blair Witch Project," A truly bad movie!
","I'm afraid I don't understand the wide appeal that this movie has generated. Having heard both good and bad things about it, I didn't know what to expect when I finally watched it.  I should have saved my money.  This movie basically drops three obnoxious film students into the woods under the premise that they are going to solve the mystery of the legendary Blair witch.  Heather, the only female in the group, was loud, obnoxious and very pushy-her major talent seemed to be screaming at the top of her lungs every time she heard a twig snap.  The other two, particularly Josh, seem to be little more than stoners whose primary preoccupations are with smoking cigarettes and using one particularly charming expletive repeatedly.I felt that the entire movie was setting the scene for something, but it never delivered.  It was merely three fools running in the woods screaming, then it ended.  Thank God.",1,3,6,27 October 1999
