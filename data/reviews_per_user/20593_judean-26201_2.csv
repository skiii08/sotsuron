Hereditary," Best Movie of 2018!!
","I was very amazed when I first saw this film. I think this might be the starting point of a whole new horror genre. I love the lack of jump scares and use of tension because it really brings out the best. I think the casting was brilliant, too! Every character was very three dimensional and didn't make stupid decisions like some of the characters in modern-day horror films. This movie gave me a racing heart and edge-of-my-seat experience!! Cheers Guys!!!!",9,0,2,9 January 2019
Carrie," Pretty good overall!!
","I really enjoyed this film. It was such a creative way of telling a story of a telekinetic girl who struggles with an abnormally religious mother and a school packed with bullies, sexual harassment, and unaware teachers. Although this adaptation of the original novel by Stephen King is an everlasting horror classic, some things could've been better.I think my least favorite part was the sound. Even though this was released in 1976, movies like Jaws had great sound, so I don't know what the deal was. Everything sounded extremely cheap and were not scary or original at all. The other thing that would have made this a better movies would have to be the ending. If the movie ended a lot earlier than it did, it would have felt more fun to watch. Everything was so dragged out, and didn't need everything it included.",7,1,3,10 January 2019
