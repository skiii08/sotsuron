Blade Runner 2049," terrible, terrible film
","If you want to see Ryan Gosling's back for a couple of hours then this movie is for you.If you want some incoherent pseudo religious up its own arse snooze fest - then this is the movie for youOh, you wanted a sequel to Blade Runner? sorry. this isn't it, so many plot holes its just not funny, a total waste of time and talent from beginning to end, the original was gritty, dark, the future was crowded tech was everywhere etc, seems the writer and director of this turkey of a movie didn't bother to watch the original, suddenly the world is almost empty of people, seriously the biggest 'crowd' scene had about 15 people in, everything is new and pristine, hell you can even have the whole of las vegas all to yourself if you like, the story is just plain dumb, things just happen for no reason, even a hologram is smarter then the blade runner and somehow manages to work out the 'puzzle' with no input whatsoever. and as for the product placement - the few people who hadn't walked out of the cinema actually laughed out loud at one point.Yes - this is the only movie I've ever been to where people where walking out not even half way through, its dumb, no story, slow as hell, just gosling being teenager moody for way too long.AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!!",1,1,5,22 October 2019
Captain Marvel," Very entertaining
","A quick review of captain marvel, it's way way better then Wonder Woman, sorry I though Wonder Woman sucked and really can't understand why 'feminists' went mad over it, an ex-model who can't act to save her life in a film where she needs a group of men to help her and a man ultimately saves the day, yes, real women power movie ffs.Anyway captain marvel isn't this at all, it's a fun entertaining action film, in the 90's style, it's not non stop modern action (which gets a bit tedious)Is it the best marvel film? Nope, is it the worst? Not by a long way, I don't understand the bad reviews, or the criticism of Brie Larson, it's funny, ok younger viewers are not going to get quite a few of the jokes as its 90's based.The special effects are top notch, the story is ok, the acting is top notch as you'd expect, it's funny has the twists we've all come to expect and a cat steals the show, what more do you want??",7,1,1,18 March 2019
Us," Interesting concept, let down by terrible characters and horror film clichÃ©
","The father in this film is the most irritating moron i've seen in a film since alien covenant, and as in alien covenant the characters do equally stupid things when confronted with life and death situations, things no one would ever do. Some nice (semi) original ideas in the film that could have made this a classic, instead someone seemed to be forcing the film into a totally different standard horror film (eg friday the 13th) , almost like it had 2 directors, one trying to make something new and fresh, and one wanting to make a 70's slasher film, and they took it turns to direct 20 minutes at a time.Oh an please, please, please STOP with these huge end of movie plot 'twists', everyone expects them now, they aren't twists anymore, anyone with half a brain worked it out. Ask yourself a simple question, is your twist as good as the sixth sense? no - then don't do it.",5,2,2,11 June 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A proper Starwars film!
","So let me start by saying I HATED the last jedi, anyone trying to follow that turd of a movie was always going to be in for a tough time.I don't think its a spolier now to say JJ has taken everything RJ set up in TLJ and thrown it in the bin, then set it on fire, and pee'd on it, all the while giving the finger to RJ, and thats no bad thing!So the Rise of skywalker. whats it like, well its back to JJ territory really - bigger is better (it isn't), some of the story is a bit all over the place mainly due to sorting the mess RJ left him, I've thought about this a bit since seeing the movie last night and (I have no idea if this is correct) its like JJ had mapped out the new trilogy, he made the force awakens and left his drafts for RJ, RJ said screw that and made TLJ, JJ comes back and says screw you RJ and still made the 3rd film he'd mapped out all those years ago, except hes had to squeeze in some fixes as RJ killed off characters he needed and added a load of new pointless ones, some of those 'fixes' work, some not so much,Its a back to basics starwars movie, no preachy messages about rich and poor, big business, wars etc , and all the better for it.For me the only part that didn't work was Leia.bottom line, its worth seeing",8,1,2,19 December 2019
Avengers: Endgame," what a ride
","If you've not seen infinity war (which as a stand alone film is better then this) and a fair chunk of the other MCU films then you're gonna hate this. Yes there are plot holes, and a a couple of truly cringeworthy moments pandering to the feminists but overall its a wild ride, its refreshing that it wasn't 3 hours of constant battles (yes transformers I'm looking at you) that just get tedious. There is a story and character development.
The 3 hours shoots by, but, you really need to see quite a few of the other MCU films to appreciate it, its not a stand alone film and I'd imagine makes no sense at all without knowing the history - you have been warned!!",8,0,6,30 April 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," sorry, its just bad
","I wanted to like this film, really, I did, but it just bad, huge huge plot holes, stupid pointless sub stories, its trying really hard to be deep and meaningful but the writer was obviously just a mentally deficient precocious child.Disney - why??? why didn't anyone at disney have the balls to stand up and say WTF is this rubbish?????and did I mention the plot holes? the huge stinking plot holes??steer well clear of this and just watch a new hope again instead",3,11,14,22 October 2019
Joker," This was going to a pile of crap or awesome, well, its not crap!
","Due to the hype this movie was going to be either a huge pile of crap, or totally awesome, and for once the hype delivers.Its going to be a very polarizing movie, you're going to love it or hate it, its not a super hero movie, so if thats what you're after then you're SOL.If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get the oscar then there is no justice in the world.I totally understand why some people are giving it 1 out of 10 and why most are giving it 10, it really doesn't fit in any predefined boxBy far the best DC movie ever.",9,3,5,10 October 2019
Alien: Covenant," If you value your sanity do not watch this film!!
","Where to start?? there is just so much wrong with this filmok, at the beginning - it just makes no sense, from the opening scene, a highly complex autonomous space craft identifies an oncoming catastrophe thats going to hit in a matter of seconds, but needs an android to hit a button to avoid it, who happens to be too far away from a console, seems we don't have wifi or bluetooth in the future then.And that was the smallest plot hole!!All these scientists then, for no reason, decide they aren't going to go to the planet that has been picked for them, surveyed etc etc but instead go to this totally unknown planet, do no checking before hand, no drones sent, no survey nothing, and land on it, all of them, at the same time, then just for kicks have no safety equipment at all - seems mankind gets even dumber in the futurenow just for kicks lets kill some people off, can't think of a decent way to do it?? well lets use the same way twice!! bingo, top idea, slipping on blood, those damn future shoes aren't too grippy.Well would you look at that, even though we didn't survey this world, WORLD, we seem to have managed to land within walking distance of the only 'living' thing on it, what are the odds??I wanted the aliens to kill everyone after about 20 minutes so I could leave.whoever wrote this rubbish should seriously look for a new career, walk around, talk to people, see that this just isn't what anyone would do, the characters acted like they where toddlers, not making bad decisions but totally unrealistic ones no one would ever make regardless of the situation.Hey fella, stick your head in this alien egg thing for me would ya, there's a good fellowThe rest of the film is a mash up of all the 'best' parts of the previous alien films, nothing new here at all.You know how frustrating all those horror films where back in the 60's / 70's where the woman (it was always a woman) would start running away, while looking over their shoulder, screaming, and inevitably trip, then not be able to get back up, just continue screaming, finally raise her arms as the monster get her? well alien covenant makes that look like the end of gone with the wind.There are far more plot holes, I just can't be bothered to list them, I've probably missed a load too in the confusion.The ending is laughably bad, the 'twist' you can guess as soon as they meet the bad android.and the less said about the main characters wig the better, why, just why?????don't waste your money on this, even if its on free tv, just don't",1,1,4,5 July 2018
