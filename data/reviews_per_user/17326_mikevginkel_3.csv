Ford v Ferrari," Just like it should be
","I went to this movie with a fellow shelby fan. And man, what an experience we had. We just smiled the entire movie. It's fun, beautifully captured and historically very accurate! I don't know what else to say about it because they did so many things right. This is a MUST SEE for every car and race enthousiast and i hope no one misses out on this incredible picture!",9,3,4,9 December 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Best movie i've seen in years
","Nuff said.But seriously. This movie is good in every single way;
Storyline: awesome
Music: fitting and epic
Visuals: strongest part of this movie. It looks so so good
Character development: really well doneThe only thing that bothered me a bit was kingpin, i would have liked to see him a bit more",9,3,5,31 December 2018
Joker," Sequel or not!?
","This movie is a rare gem. It's daring and fresh and a real thriller. I enjoyed it so much that i want to see more of joaquin phoenix' joker but i don't know if that would work. I recommend everyone to watch this, especially if you don't like the modern comic book movies. It's an entirely different experience from anything cb related movie we've seen so far.",9,1,1,5 October 2019
