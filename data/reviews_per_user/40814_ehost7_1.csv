War Dogs," Dark Comedic Take on Iraq Gun Runners - What Could Have Been?
","When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I was intrigued. The screenplay was extremely promising. A true story of two 20 something stoners turned gun runners during the Iraq War, and it was directed by Todd Phillips? Will this go the way of Spotlight, or even The Wolf of Wall Street?It does not reach the acclaim of either of those two films, but I will say that it makes for an entertaining watch. War Dogs borders on the seriousness of Spotlight, but also includes the debauchery of Wolf. And that's not a bad thing, but it cheaply cashes out instead of digging deeper.Phillips took many creative liberties with the story. Take a look at the original Rolling Stone piece, or any other article and you'll see exactly what I am talking about.Jonah Hill and Miles Teller portray the two real life runners, Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz, despite looking nothing like them. They are here for the laughs. Both offer plenty, but Teller's character provides a seriousness to counter Hill's Scarface persona. They create a dynamic buddy pairing that neither is bad, nor great.Phillips picked a screenplay that is so interesting, it would be very difficult to screw up. He avoids doing so by instead taking the safe route. For more substance, check out the movie's inspiration, the book 'Arms and the Dudes.'",7,3,7,16 August 2016
