The Ring," Flawed but genuinely scary
","I love the original Japanese Ring movies but having seen this, I think the US remake is just as good in its own stylish way.The story (and some of the dialogue) doesn't hold water but this is first and foremost a horror film.  It's supposed to scare the crap out of you and it delivers in spades.  It goes for flinch scares rather than gore and is all the more effective for it.Naomi Watts is that rare thing: a great actress who deserves her success. If the script occasionally lets her down, for the most part this film is creepy, atmospheric, stylishly shot and if it doesn't scare you, there's something seriously wrong with you.  (Or you're a Japanese film snob who sniffs at the mention of remakes).",8,0,0,17 March 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Fun but hugely overrated
","I saw POTC at the cinema and wasn't that blown away by it to be honest. So I rented it to see if maybe I liked it more second time around, seeing as how everybody seems to rate it so highly.But no, I still think it's overlong, unfunny and...just average really. It's not the worst film ever, but it certainly doesn't deserve the 'best film of the summer' taglines either. There's too much talk and not enough action IMO, and the leads are pretty to look at, but utterly bland in the acting stakes (Bloom and Knightley have all the sexual chemistry of two wet towels being thrown together). And Depp is just annoying. What's so 'brave' about a performance that basically comes down to pretending to be drunk for the entire movie. Brave? I'd call it lazy if anything. And I'm a big Johnny Depp fan, before you beat me with clubs.Cutthroat Island however, is a much better pirate movie IMO. Hell, all the best action in POTC is stolen from this very movie (the monkey, the ship-to-ship firefight, characters getting trapped in the hold before the ship blows up).Don't get me wrong, I liked POTC, but can't help but feel it's hugely overrated, especially compared to the bombastic action in Cutthroat Island. I hope POTC 2 is an improvement",7,0,1,4 December 2003
Van Helsing," So bad it's good
","Pretty much what we were expecting from Sommers: cardboard characters, bad dialogue, bad script, great CGI action sequences.The first half of the film is great, especially the black and white Frankenstein scene, Dracula's eccentric speeches as he walks the castle, and Mr Hyde: the film's best CGI character.Jackman and Beckinsale look great but are given little to do but run and fight so their characters aren't as interesting and you don't care for them as much as you should.  And this is the film's biggest mistake.  If Sommers had cut an action scene or two and replaced them with smaller more intimate moments, this could have been something special.  As it is, it's just enjoyable trash with nice expensive CGI and great production values.I liked the ending but as I said, since the characters aren't rounded, we don't feel the strong emotions we should.  Van Helsing is so bad it's good.7/10",7,0,0,7 May 2004
Moulin Rouge!," A bloody mess
","I loved Baz Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet and was looking forward to finally seeing Moulin Rouge.  Unfortunately I found out it was a loud mess of a movie, edited to within an inch of its life.Apparently this is 'reinventing the musical'.  Well yes, if by reinvention you mean 'no melodies' and 'snatches of pop song lyrics thrown around like confetti'.Some would argue the film is refreshing, and in some ways it is because the cast and director are plainly doing whatever they think is fun, but I found it to be like a four year old with a toy: it's fun for him but bloody annoying for you because he's so loud.This is a bloody mess of a movie, and I'm usually very open-minded.",6,0,4,28 September 2003
The Fly," Classic horror
",This is one of those really gory horror films you watch when you're ten years old and are never the same again.The original movie was a bit of camp fun (Scientist gets head turned into a crap plastic fly mask) whereas Cronenberg chooses to take things seriously and give us gore and suspense.  Goldblum has never been better (notice he nearly always plays scientists or teachers) and the special FX still stand up nearly 20 years later.Shame about the nasty sequel.,10,1,2,31 August 2003
Bruce Almighty," Some hilarity but far from a classic
","Much as I like Jim Carrey, isn't he getting a bit old for this?  Pulling faces at 40 just highlights his wrinkles.On the other hand there is a childish delight at seeing Ace Ventura: TV Reporter.  The film takes a while to get going and some of Carrey's mugging smacks of overkill (or maybe desperation), but when Bruce Almighty gets the jokes right... boy does it work.  Witness Bruce influencing a rival TV man to speak in a squeaky voice during the news, or Bruce's breakdown and use of the F-word live on air.  Morgan Freeman has some fun with the role of God, but when the film stumbles under its own theological weight and turns semi-serious in the third act, things become predictable and stale when you just want Carrey to do something funny.  Aniston's role is underwritten to say the least.Bruce Almighty has some laugh out loud moments, but it's no classic.  Oh well - at least it's better than Shadyac's last two films.",7,1,3,3 July 2003
