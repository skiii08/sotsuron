The Blair Witch Project," It's like an internet stock:
","It's like an internet stock:  it was hyped on the internet, soared briefly after its IPO (sorry, its premiere) and is destined to sink toward oblivion. The idea is very clever; but the realization is mostly a bunch of X-Gens whining over who got them lost in the woods and how they're going to get the equipment back to the rental store.  Over and over again one keeps thinking: they're lost, they're hungry, they're scared; why do they keep the cameras running?  The answer of course is that there wouldn't be a film without it. I'd rank this a lot lower except that it does have the one great virtue of a mediocre ultra-low budget film--audacity.  Some thirty-five years ago, some teenage friends of mine set out to make an 8mm version of the Ten Commandments; the only scene they got on film was the un-parting of the Red Sea.  It was awful.  It had guts.  I give points for guts.",6,0,1,6 August 1999
Unbreakable," Less and more
","Less and more than The Sixth Sense.  In some ways, this film is just a reworking of Sixth Sense, with Willis in the Osment slot.  The style, the structure, and many of the themes are the same.  Both depend a great deal on mood, and both leave a few plot threads unresolved.  Unbreakable is less because we've seen Sixth Sense, and so can anticipate the plot pretty well (including the shock ending).  It's a bit more because it is darker and more thought-provoking.  The movie drops a terrible moral conundrum in our laps--and gives us almost no clue toward its resolution.  The rather sunny resolution of Sixth Sense is replaced with something very bitter.  The movie would have been better if this bitterness were not so dependent on a brief twist at the end, but were more integrated into the characters' development. Nonetheless, it's a solid bit of work that seems better and better upon reflection.",8,0,0,24 November 2000
The Birth of a Nation," It's agony to watch
","It's agony to watch this film.  One must approach it exactly as one does Triumph of the Will.  There is historical significance, and technical excellence, and dreadful bigotry, all in one.  DWG was absolutely unconscious of his intolerance; to him, white superiority was so evident that he was utterly unable to see its savage nature, or the vileness of this racist celebration.  When, a year later, he tried to repent of Intolerance, he never repudiated this Birth, a birth that triggered the rebirth of the Ku Klux Klan.  The movie is, at the same time, a stunning summation of all that film could do in 1915; the battle scenes in particular hold up remarkably well. Do always remember that many Americans, black and white, condemned its pornographic racism.",7,2,6,31 July 1999
Shakespeare in Love," An overrated, but charming, bit of fluff
","An overrated, but charming, bit of fluff; as is true in many minor movies, the atmospherics are better than the main plot.  One gets a real feel for what it was probably like in Elizabethan England to be an impecunious player.  The jokes are amusing, but much too arch; the story is the sort of thing that one expects from Harvard or Oxbridge undergraduates.  The minor characters are far better etched than the stars.  The few campy minutes of Queen Elizabeth are far better than the whole dull lump of the putative heroine.",6,2,4,31 July 1999
The Others," Solid but predictable
","Solid but predictable, especially if one has seen other recent ghost movies. The resolution left a number of loose ends which could have been more imaginatively brought together.  The core of the film--the relationship between the living and the dead--could and should have produced something more than a not-very surprise ending.  The historical background--the German occupation of the Channel Islands during WWII--was merely used as a prop, not at a part of the narrative.  Similarly, the use of Catholic imagery and theology (which was often oddly misstated) seem to have little or no bearing on the story or its resolution.  The Others has the ingredients of a classic, but fails to blend them into a satisfying whole.",7,0,0,20 August 2001
Judgment at Nuremberg," One can't hate this movie, but
","One can't hate this movie, but one has to regret that it never quite fulfills the promise of its best moments.  These include not only the finely etched performances of Dietrich and Schell, but also the deep irony that dogs a passionate prosecution of crimes that America itself committed then, and commits today; crimes to which America was indifferent in the shadow of the cold war.  Schell's invocation of Oliver Wendell Holmes for the defense should (but undoubtedly doesn't) give pause to the seemingly innumerable contemporary supporters of eugenics. It was my first exposure to the filmed records of Shoah (I was about 12 when I first saw the movie) and those images can never, I hope, be erased.  And yet, and yet--it is so dull, it is so cut to fit the formulae of Hollywood; and, as other commenters have pointed it, it has Tracy at his pompous predictable liberal worst, rehearsing Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.  His best scenes are as Dietrich's foil; the very best when he is the excuse for her commentary on Lili Marlene.This is painfully close to a great movie; its failure is especially sad because its subject calls for greatness.",7,4,13,11 August 1999
Duck Soup," Perfect Marxism:
","Perfect Marxism:  a collage of old vaudeville gags and cynical humor; almost unencumbered by Hollywood impositions and sentimentality (which alas is probably why it fared poorly at the box office).  Virtual anarchy, in the sense of the Lord of Misrule sending satyrs among the sober and sensible madmen who run things.  Outside of Qoheleth, is there anything better to shove into the teeth of the gods of this world than:  'They got guns/We got guns/All God's chillen got guns?'",Null,0,0,7 September 1999
Pearl Harbor," Ed Wood has risen from the dead,
","Ed Wood has risen from the dead, and gotten a large budget.  That is the only explanation for this supreme turkey.  Among the Ed Wood touches are dialogue that seems to have been badly translated from Albanian and actors who apparently were cut from the cast of a failed dinner-theatre production of Clue.  Ed Wood of course is famous for his insertion of stock footage at random points in his movies, and a good bit of Pearl Harbor appears to have been constructed from stock footage.  Maybe its the computers that make it look that way.It's a bad sign when one finds it difficult to remember the characters' names or to remember which one is which.  I wouldn't have minded this so much if more of them had killed.I thought it was impossible to make a worse 'historical' movie than Titanic, but I was wrong.This movie made me wish that the Japanese had won the war.",1,0,1,20 August 2001
Titanic," Without doubt, the worst
","Without doubt, the worst movie ever to win the Oscar for Best Picture.  A ghastly script, which, feeble-minded and cliche-ridden as it is, proved far beyond the infantile acting ability of the stars left one rooting for the one real hero--that vast block of ice that sank the ship and took us all out of our misery.  The music is bad, the plot is absurd, the much vaunted realism in recreating the boat was done just as well forty years ago (in A Night to Remember); this is just further proof that the ability of audiences to see movies has deteriorated due perhaps to a combination of food additives and computer graphics.  It's not even bad enough to be funny; it's just flat out bad.",2,3,6,31 July 1999
Signs," One can't ignore the religious
","One can't ignore the religious backdrop of MNS's movies (and his own life)--a mixture of Anglican/Episcopalianism and Roman Catholicism.  These are the two tracks of his own background, and inform all of his movies. Sixth Sense has more than a touch of the Catholic idea of Purgatory.  Signs' lead character seems to be an Episcopal priest.  In Signs, the alien invasion is an Hitchcockian 'McGuffin' that allows the director to play with the serious theological problems of theodicy (the existence of evil in a divinely created and directed world) and divine providence.  The ending goes flat for those who reject the divine decree that evil is idiotic; specifically, that the aliens who are vulnerable to water invade a world that is mostly water.  Their plans are absurd in precisely the way that Hitler at the height of his power planed absurdly; he failed to invade the England that would have fallen to him in a very few weeks and instead invaded the Russia whose endless spaces defeated him.  Divine providence ensures that evil in the end is incredibly stupid.  One may or may not accept this as true, but it is the belief that underlies these films.Like it or not, MSN is making religious movies.  He is using every Hollywood gimmick to make his movies sell.  There is a lot here that is derivative (I have not read all the comments, but surely it is obvious that one of the movies from which he has borrowed is 'Day of the Triffids').  Yet the whole idea of an Indian-Philadelphian-Anglican-Catholic-Hitchcockian is so new that I for one intend follow his career with great interest!",8,0,1,5 August 2002
The Sixth Sense," An odd pastiche that oddly works.
","An odd pastiche that oddly works.  Excluding the terrifying prologue, the movie breaks down into four sections.  The first is a taut psychological thriller.  The second is a well-made, though essentially traditional, horror story with just a bit of gore.  The third makes an odd, and inadequately explained, transformation of the horror story into a rather sentimental and somewhat new-age-ish tale of redemption.  The last is a 'surprise' ending that should not be a surprise to anyone who has carefully noted (1) certain incongruities in part two and (2) the nature of the transformation in part three.  Even if it is deduced in advance, the ending is very well presented and largely satisfying.Despite the constant shifts in tone, the movie for the most part carries the viewer along with it.  The production is pure Hollywood, but Hollywood at its best; for example, the scary bits are announced with the same sort of camerawork and sound effects that Hitchcock polished to perfection long ago. The acting is uniformly good.  One surprise is that Bruce Willis can act. His young more-or-less co-star handles a somewhat disconcerting variety of moods and mannerisms remarkably well.  Somehow, after all this, it's hard to be scared of the woods.",8,0,0,6 August 1999
