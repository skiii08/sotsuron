The Devil's Advocate," Devil in your soul
",The Devil's Advocate is a film with good morale. Al Pacino really looks devilish in this film. The theme is good. Be alert!! not only advocates...beware of the devil in your soul. The film is worth watching.,Null,0,1,12 March 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Wars can only make worries
","Saving Private Ryan is a magnificent artistic piece. It is a good lesson to all those people who are interested in war. Especially to the Presidents and Prime ministers of all those countries making our beautiful earth a violent one. Wars, without any exception - world war, internal dispute, caste war or anything of that sort, can only make people worried about their near and dear. Watch the bloodshed and firing in this film before filling your gun with explosives.",Null,0,0,21 April 1999
