Sucker Punch," one of the greatest films of all time
","the movie sucker punch is literally a sucker punch to the mind. no doubt the action was pure mind shattering creativity from the daemonic samurai gargoyles with machine guns to robot Nazis to med-evil knights and futuristic cyborgs. along with the great emotional realistic plot that will make you have to fight back tears. however, people are forgetting to mention the deep philosophical part of the movie that will leave your mind set of reality changed forever. sucker punch is no doubt one of the greatest films of all time. That i will watch over and over and over till my eyes bleed. and i feel sorry for any one who misses it or cant comprehend it. a must see atomic mind blowing creative,philosophical, emotional, action.",10,6,19,26 March 2011
