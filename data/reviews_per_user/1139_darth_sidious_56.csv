The Rock," Entertaining!
","I don't like many Bay movies because he has very little skill in crafting a honest and detailed movie. Armageddon was a horrendous piece of donkey dung, everything that's wrong with Hollywood was detailed in that schlock!The Rock is a slightly different proposition, it's entertaining and never tries to be anything but! The story is thin and the dialogue is typically bad at times. The action is excellent and Sean Connery makes the movie work!The direction is very Mtv, the editing is silly at times - what's with the quick cuts? Why can't I enjoy the compositions? Pathetic! But still, the pace is consistent.The acting is okay, Connery's presence elevates the material. Ed Harris is always dependable and Cage is pretty funny as Goodspeed.The music is very patriotic and but fun.Overall, entertaining, switch your brain off! After this, Bay descended into familiar MTV garbage!",Null,1,1,25 February 2002
Scarface," Class!
","I haven't seen the original, but the re-make is certainly something very classy. The plot is not innovative, but the performances and direction are pretty good. There are times when the picture spends little time adding meat to a few scenes, but overall this is a terrific picture.Al Pacino is over-the-top, but you know what? It works!The films core is about getting to the top, but the top is not good enough!The photography is good, I didn't think it was awesome, there are some stunning shots, though. The widescreen composition is excellent.The music is awesome, the electronic score works wonders for the mood.Overall, it's probably the best gangster picture of the 80s.",Null,0,0,25 June 2001
Gremlins," Juvenile fun
","Re-watching Gremlins after many years, I found myself a little bored with the opening of the picture. The first 30 minutes range from good to bad, I found the characters boring. But once the Gremlins come into play, things get much better, infact, I couldn't stop laughing at the juvenile jokes and stupidity. The Gremlins are the stars of the show, I didn't particulary care for main human characters...they seemed so poorly written, or lacked good direction.The photography is servicable, but the directing seemed a little uninspired to me. The Gremlins are excellent puppets, you do believe that they exist. Technically, the film is fine, but I wish more thought was put into the characters, and the first 20 minutes were condensed into something more interesting than the usual introductions.",Null,0,1,16 December 2002
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Set pieces, not cohesive
","After watching The Phantom Menace for the third time in 2 years, it's safe to say that the film relies on set-pieces rather being a cohesive picture.There are 2 major sequences which are awesome, the pod race and the lightsabre battle. The other parts of the picture are mixed, some are good, some are bad.Dialogue has always been a problem with Star Wars, and it's the same again. Trust me, the dialogue is very weak between LIam Neeson and Ewan McGregor. Ewan had nothing to do, but this will change in Episode2.The Darth Sidious and Palpatine characters are my favourite, they add the depth to the picture. These parts will grow even stronger later in the series of prequels.Jar-Jar Binks added too much kiddie humour, I think these movies don't need them, just stick to telling a good story.As I said, the Pod Race is an amazing sequence, as is the Lightsabre battle, which is the most exciting yet, although not as powerful as the one in Jedi or Empire.The acting is obviously average, I wish Lucas spent more time with the actors!The director makes full use of the wide-screen frame, watching in full frame is horrendous.Overall, a mix start to the Prequel series.",Null,0,2,19 April 2001
Raiders of the Lost Ark," They don't make them like this anymore!
","Probably one of Speilberg's best pictures, near perfect direction. There was a time when Speilberg was untouchable, although he's making serious pictures now, I do miss the more exciting adventures.The story is quite nice and moves at a perfect pace thanks to some excellent pacing. There is no point in me giving anything away, just sit back and enjoy.Harrision Ford is amazing, enough said. Infact, every performance is top notch, can't fault anyone.Technically, the film is beautifully shot, just check out the opening 10 minutes, how perfect is the cinematography. The special effects are excellent, thanks to a International team.There a re a few nitpicks, but nothing that really hurts the film too much.John Williams' score is another winner, great rousing theme, fantastic action and some superb eerie music.Overall, a near perfect picture by Steven Spielberg, they don't make'em like that anymore.",Null,0,0,5 October 2000
Meet the Parents," Derivative
","Derivative! Meet the Parents is quite boring, there's nothing knew here to enjoy. The story is, obviously, very predictable!The film never attempts to go that one step further with the jokes, they sort of fall flat.De Niro does his job as does everyone else, but don't expect anything special.The direction is safe, the screenplay is boring and the music is forgettable.Overall, a derivative and boring picture - I expected much more!",Null,1,2,21 February 2002
Unbreakable," Nearly a comic book masterpiece
","Make no bones about it, Unbreakable is one of the best comic books to be ever filmed. The film has so much detail, so many layers that anyone who didn't understand the picture should have another viewing.It's easy to dismiss Unbreakable as slow and pretentious! You know, sometimes the camera work borders on pretentious, but the innovative approach to the storytelling and style is breathtaking.The film is basically one act of the story, the 3 act structure is dismissed, instead the director/writer has chosen to take the origins of the comic book character and tell its story, not its heroics, but its birth!
The whole comic conventions are placed in the story, interwoven into a non-conventional screenplay. The performances are magnificent, quality acting by everyone!The direction is stunning at times, method approach was used consistently. The panavision frame was used perfectly, making the film unbearable in pan and scan, which should be banned, anyway.The score is perfect, adds a lot of atomosphere.Unbreakable is an innovative piece of film-making. I think the film is much more appealing to folks who understand the director's vision.",Null,0,0,9 February 2002
Akira," Interesting innovation
","Akira is an interesting concept, it's an animation for a mature crowd. Sit back and enjoy the visuals, Akira works on a visual status, so you have to listen to the English dub. Akira's animation is moody, dark and unique in design, although it has been copied, I'm guessing not many have attained the God-like status of Akira.What is it about? I don't quite understand it all, it does require a few viewings. The English dub isn't perfect, ideally you want to read the subtitles and listen to the Japanese soundtrack, but the visuals make it impossible to do this for the first few viewings.Enjoy Akira, it's a unique animation picture.",Null,0,3,18 February 2002
Amistad," Good film but is it accurate?
","The slaves topic will always be a very volatile subject but is this film accurate in its historical re-telling? That's a difficult question for me to answer but I think a good portion of this picture shows us just what African people had to suffer from a minority of the white race and their own.This is not Spielberg's best direction, the framing was inconsistent but the photography was delightful and detailed.The acting was good all round. Not being an historian, I can't comment on the story's accuracy especially the court scenes. This picture probably was a little too long, the screenplay really required some more work.",Null,0,2,22 July 2000
Shakespeare in Love," Class British film-making does the business again
","As usual, British film-making (backed by American money) leads the way, with Hollywood trailing a million miles away. Not over-blown, horrid glossy commercialism photography with lacklustre directors and cast, no, this IS film-making at its best.The photography is fantastic, the lighting shows off the realistic sets. One of the best photographed films in recent times. The direction was great, but sometimes the framing needed better composition, I didn't think the shots were always consistent. The sets were built looked very authentic.The acting is fantastic, not even Affleck could ruin it, he was actually very good.The story is quite interesting, it's fiction, so don't take it seriously etc. The dialogue can be difficult to hear and understand. For this reason, this picture needs to be viewed at least twice.Overall, the film is very good, but better shot composition was needed during some of the scenes. It's not the greatest film ever, but very enjoyable, especially the photography.",Null,0,0,23 August 2000
12 Angry Men," Lumet Masterpiece
","Probably Lumet's best picture. The film is not about story, it's about 12 characters, 12 very different people deliberating a straight-forward murder case, but as the picture goes on, things are not clear cut.The film features 12 fantastic characters, each one is different, each one has different reasons for their answers. Henry Fonda is brilliant, maybe not his best role, but still fantastic.Lumet's direction is not gimmicky. The director puts us in the film, you are part of this jury, we are number 13.The film is shot in black and white, perfect photography.I can't say too much, just watch it because it's a masterpiece derived from a simple story. This is a character picture.Enjoy.",Null,0,1,26 September 2000
The English Patient," Excellent artistic picture
","The English Patient will divide the film fans, some will hate it, some will love it. I think it's a super picture, very artistic. The story, well, hmmm, there isn't a strong narrative or focus to the picture, it's kinda weird, some parts of the film do not have the meat, it seemed a bit inconsistent. The film is not about story telling, it's artistic directing, pieces of film put together. Sometimes the film lacks the cohesion, not always perfectly binding.It's a tough film for me to review, but I assure you, if you are interested in film-making, one must study this picture.The film is about love, deceit and adventure, I can't pin it down to one category.The performances are superb.The technical standard of the picture is extremely high, very reminiscent of David Lean. The photography is stunning, beautifully composed shots.Overall, an excellent film even though it has a few problems in the narrative and character definition, I love it!!! Just enjoy the art!",Null,0,1,20 November 2000
Elizabeth," The director was over-ambitious in an otherwise good picture
","I was surprised with this picture, not being clued-up on the Elizabeth years I found the film very interesting but surely inaccurate. The film doesn't feature any battles, it never rises to epic proportions. I suppose the budget wasn't large enough to accommodate one particular battle. This film isn't a Hollywood production, it's produced by British talent (backed by some American money). And again, the British technical crew blow away a lot of the Hollywood productions.The film's director is way over ambitious with his camera work, sometimes I'm in awe of the camera angles and other times I'm stamping the floor with frustration. The editing is awful, espeically in the first 30 minutes, we are given so many close-ups which convey absolutely no feeling. And they do affect the scenes drastically! It seems that the director didn't set-up a decent position with his DP or tried too hard without picturing his film in his head. Shame really.Other than that, the director's work is good. The British photography is excellent, reason enough to see it.The finale of the film is poor, it ends too quickly, very under played. The film doesn't reach a climax as one would expect. The acting is fine as one would expect with a foreign cast but Eric Cantona? Soccer turned actor? No thank you.Overall, an inaccurate screenplay but an enjoyable picture by a promising director.",Null,2,3,9 September 2000
Blade," Below average comic book flick
","The best comic book film is? Superman The Movie. The worst? Not sure, but this one fits near the bottom of the scale.The dark comic book character trend continues in this rather lacklustre adventure. Blade is cool, but nothing else. Blade kills vampires, yippie! Do we know anything about the character, his past as a boy? NO. Do we care? NO.Character development is thrown out of the window along with dialogue and interesting characters. There seems little motivation in the screenplay, it's all a bit boring. Snipes does no acting, Dorff tries and does well-ish.The direction is inconsistent, Norrington has potential for a Batman film if he gets a good screenplay.The fight scenes are very well done, I enjoyed them. The special effects are pretty inconsistent, CGI not perfected yet. The film score is horrendous, boring and hurts the film.The action scenes keep this film alive, worth watching with friends on a Friday night. I can't recommend this.Viewed in widescreen.",Null,1,5,19 August 2000
The Mummy," Entertains, but the films falls flat on its face if you analyse it.
","The opening sequence to the Mummy is pretty good, but once the picture cuts to the hero, it really suffers in the story, plot and dialogue. The story is poorly constructed, as is the horrid dialogue, but the film moves at a decent pace.It entertains, but if you have trouble leaving your brain at the door, then don't watch this. I have trouble leaving my brain at the door, but somehow I managed to get through this picture, and it was enjoyable.The film's special effects are atrocious at times, a lot of f/x look fake. This proves that computers cannot always produce a quality effect, other tools, or use of models would've been more appropiate.The acting is fair, some the characters are annoying in the picture. Being a fan of Rachel Weisz is one reason to watch this film, but she does get corny lines in most movies. Brendan Fraiser does what he can with a lacklustre script.The screenplay is poorly structured and defies logic.The directing is okay, but should've asked for a serious re-write, the script is way too campy and tongue-in-cheek.
You must see this wide-screen.",Null,1,2,5 February 2001
X-Men," A very good start to a new comic book movie franchise
","Superman is the definitive comic book film, but in 2nd place comes X-men. I've never read any comics, so I was really surprised by this picture, it's certainly moving in the right direction, and expect a decent sequel. X-men lays the foundation, a bit like Superman, but whereas Superman 2 was a step down, X-men 2 should blow away the original.The X-men has interesting Super-heros, they have powers which have a bad side, they are not perfect. I really like this idea, it makes the films franchise last longer, and the potential of sequel ideas is infinite.The acting in the film is excellent, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is excellent, steals the show in my opinion. James Marsden and Halle Berry didn't have a lot of meat in the picture, I think the sequels could sort this out.The editing of the picture was the major disappointment, the 2nd act was disjointed and the progress of the picture was hampered. This was an editing error, can be sorted out when and if A Special Edition cut appears. Storm, Cyclops, Toad and Sabertooth have no depth, I think a bit more work on them in the sequel.The screenplay isn't bad, hard to judge when the picture is obviously edited harshly.The direction is nice, I think Singer has put in verisimilitude, which make us believe just like Superman The Movie.The wide-screen framing is pretty good, unwatchable in pan and scan.Overall, a good start despite the 2nd act being disjointed.",Null,0,0,11 June 2001
A Bridge Too Far," Excellent stuff!!!
","Forgotten by many, this picture needs to be rediscovered because it's excellent! I hardly hear this film being mentioned with the great WAR pictures.The film is about a failed mission, enough said. The main point of the picture is about the loss of lives, the men behind the desks making dumb decisions, blatant lies and risking everything.Dickie Attenborough's direction might have lacked some focus, but the picture was so huge that it was an incredible task to make it authentic. The film is extremely well detailed, using authentic vehicles, superb destruction sequences and stunning locations. I reckon Dick did a great job with the direction.The stars of the film do their job well, the acting was good. I thought Gene Hackman had very little to do.The photography is stunning, the soft focus and smokey screen is a trademark of Unsworth, he used this to great effect in Superman The Movie.
The ending is quite piognant, it really says a lot about war.Superb picture, thanks Richard Attenborough! See it only in wide-screen.",Null,2,4,28 December 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Very good
","The Auteur, Tim Burton, delivers a film which is probably one of his finest. This is so Burton, Sleepy Hollow was made for Burton, from sets to gloomy colour to dark humour, this is TIM! Burton's work is backed up by the great artists in England who made Sleepy Hollow fantastic. I really believed this world could exist, that my friends is verisimilitude!The story is confusing, but I think it makes the film better because you have to watch it again to get it all. The acting is superb, Depp is awesome, his mannerisms are perfect, truely an underrated actor. Ricci has a wonderful Disney type quality to her and the British actors prove yet again that they are the best!The direction is excellent, the shot composition is perfect, making full use of the lense. The photography is stunning, it perfectly captures the mood, man, it's PERFECT!!!The production design is awe-inspiring, you couldn't it was location or set footage, all seamless.Elfman's score is terrific.The film did leave me unsatisfied at times, I wish the horror element was stronger.Overall, classic Burton at his best!",Null,0,1,27 June 2001
MASH," Interesting
","This picture is quite interesting in its portrayl of how one can cope during the stupidity of war. There is no message in this picture, there is no strong narrative, no story. It's a barrage of jokes edited together perfectly. Altman's direction is quite unique, the strong zooms, the editing, over-lapping dialogue. The fact that there is no plot throws up challenges, and I certainly admire the effort put into this by all concernedThe production values are terrific and the photography is miserable, which is perfect!Sutherland is so damn perfect, such a terrific performance, I love the goofy style.There are times when the picture isn't interesting and sometimes things fall flat. But there are jokes and laughs which this film relies on during the absurd war, it's the joking that keeps these characters alive.I wouldn't say this picture features a good screenplay but the direction is so unique that it deserves to be seen by everyone. They don't make challenging works like this anymore.Remember to watch this film in widescreen otherwise you'll miss out on 43% of the picture.",Null,11,20,25 July 2000
Alien," Terrific
","Ridley Scott's ALIEN is an example of great horror film-making. It's not the creature, but the design of the locations, the smoke, claustophobic rooms and atomsphere. The characters are nicely written, this is not your post-modern horror!ALIEN has a distinct style, the pacing is deliberate, the tension builds and builds. The film is a real master stroke by Ridley Scott and his team.The acting is excellent, I can't fault anyone. Weaver has the lead was a gamble, and a brave choice by all concerned. I'm happy to say that it pays off! The design of the ALIEN is fascinating, work of a genius.The special effects are tremendous, again, there's a distinct style, it's so fantastic!The score by Goldsmith plays more like a special sound effect, but it does fit the mood of the picture.The wide-screen frame is used to the max, do not watch this in pan and scan!ALIEN is a film which should be studied and studied, tons of details in the entire picture.",Null,0,1,25 January 2002
Bridget Jones's Diary," Quality!
","What made this film work? What made this film break the usual British romantic conventional route? One actress! Her name is Renee Zellwegger, seriously, if the actress was British, this film would've been -'been there, done that'. Instead, this clever casting has made Bridget Jones a wonderful little picture.Renee Zellwegger is an actress who changed to suit the screenplay, now that is ACTING! Her mannerisms, her weight, her enthusiasm and cutesy style are a wonder to behold.Colin Firth does a great job, he plays his role well, a future James Bond perhaps? Hugh Grant finally gives us something different, he was actually quite funny at times.Maguire as the director handles the proceedings extremely well, this is her debut and I think she will become quite successful with small films. The Super35 wide-screen frame is used well, bravo! The screenplay is lightweight, but written well, plenty of ad-lib and spontaneity transcend the script.As a male, sit back and have a laugh. Quality!",Null,60,81,23 December 2001
The Godfather: Part II," Coppola spoils us again with his second masterpiece
","Coppola spoils us again, the continuing saga of the Corleoni family is an amazing piece of cinema. The Godfather part2 isn't a sequel, it just continues the story as Michael stretches his empire into new ventures whilst keeping his family together.The film also features the backstory of Vito Corleoni and his rise in New York during the 1910s and 20s. The film is just as powerful as the first, this film is even stronger with the characters. John Cazle's Freddo is fully developed in this one.The acting is flawless, I mean it just doesn't get any better than this. I love everyone in this film, the performances come right out of their hearts.
The direction is amazing as is the screenplay. Intricate details and characters have a lot of meat.The story grabs you, you are in their world, 3 hours of near-perfection.A Masterpiece, thank you Coppola!",Null,0,0,18 December 2000
Notting Hill," Not bad
","Yet again, we have a British film which doesn't offer anything knew. Notting Hill is an average lightweight picture, which never challenges or tries to be different. We have the usual Hugh Grant, oh boy, he doesn't have a wide range of acting skills, does he? This is the same role as Four Weddings and a Funeral. The British film industry is technically superb, we have the best film technicians in the world, our films are photographed with a sense of verismilitude, but we lack ideas, this is why we'll never compete with Hollywood from a money point of view.Notting Hill is a simple, very simple picture, the story never takes off in any direction. You'll come away feeling that the picture didn't achieve much. Interesting to note that the film tries to paint movie stars in a fresh light. I think it's the simplicity of the picture which makes it undemanding for the viewers, it wasn't boring, but not exciting, either. The direction is good, I thought the scenes were handled well, even the predictable finale, one could see it coming a mile off. I think a better script could've helped.The acting is fine, I think the supporting work was excellent, but Hugh Grant was just too light, and Julia Roberts was terribly shallow, she had nothing to offer. It's not surprising to see why the film made money, but the lightweight script was disappointing, still, I think most romantic film fans will enjoy it.",Null,0,1,14 May 2001
American Pie," Amusing at times, but really! This is a disgrace
","I thought this was going to a good teen film, but I was wrong. The Breakfast Club is STILL the best in the teen/brat pack genre, American Pie isn't special, it isn't unique at all.The problem with the film is that it centres on the sex too much, yet never goes in any depth with characters. There was a lack of seriousness. It doesn't try to give something to the audience, I think director was more interested in shocking the audience (It failed).I'll give some credit, there are some amusing moments, especially when one kid gets ahold of the pie, nuff said!The writing was boring, it featured characters you seen before. The direction was aimed at teens who think they are hip, how pathetic!Don't bother with this trash, The Breakfast Club is still the best!",Null,1,1,3 April 2001
American Psycho," Interesting, always interesting!
","By the end, I didn't know what to make of it, but now I understand the film much better. This film is must viewing, it brings out the truth about today's world - Nothing but material values matter, we live empty lives, we think empty thoughts, we are empty people, life is boring.Christian Bale is awesome, quality acting! Willem Dafoe was underused, I didn't think the support cast had the same quality material as Bale.The photography is stylish, very 80s gloss!The direction is terrific, wonderful camera work.Overall, see it, it's satire, black comedy, social commentary and more!",Null,159,271,22 October 2001
Apocalypse Now," Masterpiece
","I quote Francis Ford Coppolla 'This is not a film about Vietnam, it IS Vietnam' How right he is. This picture is in my top 10 alongside classics such as Superman and Lawrence of Arabia. The 1970s was a great decade for Francis, all his films were masterpieces back then and this one is no exception.The film is about a man who is disillusioned with Saigon and is thrown into a mission to terminate a green beret soldier, Marlon Brando. That's all I want to say regarding the story. The film is a journey into madness and insanity. We journey with Willard played by Martin Sheen with a group of soldiers, each one with a different persona.. We meet insane people, we see the most stupid situations. The film clearly points out how stupid and insane everything in war is. There is quite a bit that I'll leave you to figure out, I don't want to spoil it for you.Technically, this picture is amazing, my jaw drops everytime I see the incredible helicopter action and the explosions. How can anyone direct this? Only Francis could. The photography is easily the best I've ever seen printed on celluloid, the colours are amazing. Everything Francis did on this picture is amazing, I can't praise him enough.The performances are amazing, Sheen is so perfect, his best performance. Marlon Brando is debatable, I mean there are a few people who could've played Kurtz, I didn't think Marlon gave his best but he was still very good. Dennis Hopper is crazy in this picture, he's excellent even though his part isn't that big. Everyone else was excellent, it must've been a tough picture for the actors, watch out for Fishbourne, he's pretty cool in this.Once you've seen this amazing picture, please watch 'Hearts of Darkness'. A documentary about the filming of Apocalypse Now. You'll appreciate the film even more.There is quite a bit of footage which was cut and maybe, just maybe us fans can see it in DVD quality one day.I always watch this film once or twice a year. I highly recommend this picture, technically perfect, excellent narrative and superb performances! You know what? They don't make'em like that anymore.",Null,0,0,5 October 2000

","What a waste of time this film is! Don't bother wasting 2 hours of your life on this trashy work. What's wrong with this film? There is NO plot, nothing interesting happens inbetween the racing. The characters are dull, there's nothing remotely interesting about them.The film has no 3 act structure, the picture never builds up to the finale. There's hardly anything for the actors to do. Everything is a mess.The cars are nice to look at, and we do get an excellent stunt sequence, but that's it. The film is so conventional, there's no set-up to the story.The direction is not the problem as much as the writing, terrible screenplay!Don't want to waste anymore time with this trash!",Null,0,1,31 January 2002
American History X," Technically astounding and the film is all too real
","Let's start by saying that Tony Kaye, the director has made one hell of a picture. Technically, the guy is fantastic, beautifully shot. The black and White photography is the best I've ever seen in a modern film. The opening credits are amazing, I can't believe how fantastic it looked.
Tony Kaye has disowned the film but I hope he'll look back and see what a technical achievement AHX really is. This is a director and cinematographer who has bags of talent, someone's skills I certainly admire. I don't think there's too much wrong with this picture, whatever happened behind the scenes, this is a terrific film.The film is all too real about our society today, the hatred, one has for another race because their own life has nothing to offer. The racism in the film is born out of frustration, passed down from parent, blaming other races for their own predicament. The film tells the story of a racist who is used and abused by his very group, neo-nazis are here because other people who orchestrate such hatred want power, they use everyone else to do their dirty work, this film shows it very well. Does hatred make the racists live a better life? NO, they are still frustrated because they are fighting an endless war.If there is a critism of the film, it's cliched in the middle and the finale is disappointing. The film required another 20 minutes to give Ed Norton's breathtaking performance more meat in the middle.The acting is fantastic, everyone was worthy of praises.Technically, the picture is perfect, shame the director doesn't feel that this is his film, albeit not his ideal cut. Every director should have the last word on his/her film.Overall, a fantastic picture but some disappointing cliche moments and the point of view is too one-sided.",Null,0,0,7 October 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Class!!!
","It's a rarity these days that an Asian Martial Arts picture gets the recognition in the West, but I'm glad people are opening their eyes and taking in the class wonders of foreign film-making.Hidden Dragon is a class picture, the film's foundations are based in the Martial Arts genre, but Ang Lee takes it further, ingraves a deep meaning, a more character driven picture. Each of the characters has a unique personality, each one has a story. There are 4 main characters, each of them is given a lot of time.The film is entirely fantasy, the fight sequences are special, even though they look like they are on wires, there's something majestic about them - they are very enjoyable to watch.The direction is  excellent, Ang Lee is a director who has delivered quality character driven pictures in the past, and he does it again here.The photography is great, but sometimes the lighting makes the background look fake.Excellent screenplay, but the flashback sequence lacked something. It seemed to be inserted rather than part of the flow.Superb film score!Overall, I'm surprised just how good a Martial Arts movie can be when characters are so strong in-depth.",Null,1,2,12 August 2001
Moulin Rouge!," Entertaining Post-modern picture
","Post-modern? YES Enjoyable? YES Over-the-top? YES Moulin Rouge is an excessive piece of film-making. Make no bones about it this film doesn't break much new ground - It uses old ideas, classic songs and bright colours to throw you into a chaos world. There isn't much to say about the plot, the film is about set pieces, it's loud, everything is big, everything is theatrical.The film is about love! The first part of the picture is interesting but so damn excessive, it's all a bit too much. 100 shots in 1 minute is headache-inducing! Tailor made for the Mtv generation!The film does work despite the post-modern ideas. I think the eye-popping features have to be the extraordinary sets! There's so much detail, without it, the film would be flushed down the toilet!The acting is okay, only Jim Broadbent really shows the class. Nicole Kidman is very sexy, fits into the world perfectly. Ewan is okay but seems a bit lost with the material.The direction is hyper-active, it lacks subtleness. Where the film does not work is the MTV editing, it's rubbish. There's no need to edit like this, it's worse than Michael's Bay cutting. Just because you can edit so quick doesn't mean you should. I know that the director wanted the film to be hyper but please! Where's the control?The use of classic songs sang in operatic fashion is quite fun, I don't think I've ever seen it done like this before.Overall, Moulin Rouge is entertaining but lacks a strong story, I guess it's all about the experience!",Null,3,4,21 March 2002
Mission: Impossible II," A disgrace to the film society. This was disgusting.
","What a disgrace this film is!!! Firstly, this film poos all over what made Mission Impossible TV show interesting. MI is about team work, not about one man, this film makes Tom Cruise the star, his inflated ego is there on the screen. I can just imagine Cruise telling Woo - 'Show me off'. Please!!!
The first film was interesting, it took 2 viewings to comprehend the complicated plot, but it laid the foundation to build a successful franchise. Although Tom Cruise was the focus of the story, I thought the next one would bring in the team and it would become a team film - I was WRONG!There's not much to praise here, John Woo is in sleep mode, his action sequences are plain boring, it's been done and done to death. Woo is so much better when he's making films in Hong Kong. This is Hollywood drivel from Woo. His trademarks takeover the film, this makes him the wrong choice, because the story is in the background. Someone like Donner can tell anyone's story, an auteur like Woo can't because his reputation is built on his specific style.The acting is boring and tedious, Thandie Newton is totally miscast. The Love story is pathetic, I was cringing! Forget the screenplay, it's bad.Tom Cruise should be ashamed of himself, he's stuck in ego land, doesn't care about the story or what makes Mission Impossible work.Is there anything to like here?  NO, avoid at all costs. I'm not surprised that this film made so much money, the audience seem to be brainwashed!The wide-screen composition was poor, too.",Null,1,2,29 December 2001
The Graduate," An important picture.
","This review contains some spoilers.It was influential back in the late 60s and I believe it still works today. The story is very simple, but the commentary on a confused graduate is terrific. A lot of people can relate to this picture, I think we all reach an age where we are confused and it's usually before becoming a man. Hoffman's out to find something, but exactly what? What does he want from life? Alienated by the older generation, he sets out on his confused journey, although this isn't planned, it just happens.During his search, he ends having an affair with Anne Bancroft, but she used for him for her own needs, this is not what he wants. He falls in love with her daughter, he gets her, but he's still in the same position as he was at the beginning of the film. The final frames are fantastic.The performances are great, Hoffman is perfect as a clueless and confused young man. The direction is superb, with the wonderful photography, very dreamy at times. The soundtrack rounds off a perfect package. This is class film-making!You simply must watch this in letterbox otherwise you haven't really seen the film.",Null,0,1,13 August 2000
Once Upon a Time in America," Masterpiece
","My title sums up the film, albeit cliche, the film is a masterpiece. The story of a gang's rise from the prohibition years to the 60s. The film's main 2 character's are the focus of the picture. Without trying to spoil it, the film addresses 3 distinct eras in their lives.The film explores the heart, Noodles soul. A man struggling with himself, someone who plays evil acts, a man who sees the pure in his childhood sweetheart. A man never at peace.The film is directed by Leone, a master of his art. I'm a huge fan of his work. Each of his films got better and better, and Once Upon A time In America was a picture which had all the experience which he achieved in the 60s. It's almost a gift to himself.The film's locations are stunning, authentic and dirty.The screenplay is excellent, but the direction makes the film. Maybe one or two characters were underwritten, but it seems that the director wanted us to talk about the picture, discuss the possible loose ends, make up our own minds. Leone's methodical pacing is stunning.The acting is tremendous, can't praise James Woods and Robert De Niro enough, awesome!The photography is beautiful, it lacks colour giving it a gritty look, perfection!Morricone delivers another masterpiece, his score adds further depth and backups the director's story.See it wide-screen, this film is a stunning piece of cinema. Leone, you were the master!",Null,7,12,3 January 2001
Toy Story 2," Toy Story 2 surpasses the original
","Toy Story 1 is terrific, but I found myself enjoying Toy Story 2 even more. I love Buzz, my favourite character, I love the little guy!It's really weird, but you really do feel for the characters, after all, they are just computer generated. It's the voices that bring them to life, Hanks and all, add depth and emotions, great stuff!The story is a bit more exciting, than the first because all the Toys go on an adventure!!!The screenplay is excellent, a lot of thought went into it, the dialogue and in-jokes will keep the adults happy, and the kids will just enjoy the adventure.Overall, see it on DVD and wide-screen, Toy Story 2 is superb! Please, please make Toy Story 3!",Null,0,1,12 March 2001
Total Recall," Good fun
","I found this movie to be quite fun to watch, it's not just an action bonanza. Throughout the movie you are trying to figure why is everything happening? I won't say too much on the plot, it's one of those which cause endless arguements with your friends.The director loves to deal with an unusual future, this one is certainly that. The film looks a little cheap, the production looks a little dated. I thought some of the imaginery looked amazing, good use of colours throughout the picture. I was disappointed that the picture was not shot in panavision scope, this film would've been better in that format.Arnie is Arnie, his acting is pretty good, he's always great to watch and he seemed to be having a great time. Sharon Stone is fine, nothing great. The villains are played very well.The screenplay needed some fixing, the finale is disappointing.The score by Jerry Goldsmith is fantastic, one of the best action scores of the 90s.Overall, a good fun film but the screenplay required a little more thought, especially the finale.",Null,0,1,3 July 2000
Rocky," I wanted to love this film, but...
","I really wanted to love this film but I didn't. The problem is that I didn't see enough of Rocky's rise to the fight. I want to know what he goes through to get to the big event. There simply isn't enough to make me cheer for Rocky.Why would Apollo want to fight someone like Rocky? It's not realistic.I didn't feel sorry for Rocky or his girlfriend. The 2nd act required beefing up. Some of the film is terrific. I love the gritty city, it looks very realistic at times, a dirty city. The direction is good. But the script required beefing up in the middle. The performances are good. This isn't about boxing, but the rise of a hero from the slums of life. I wished it work better!",Null,0,3,22 May 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," Fascinating
","The first time I watched 'Eyes Wide Shut' was in September 1999 -  I liked it but I didn't connect with it. I watched it again recently and my opinion has become stronger, I now connect with the picture, and I must say it's a fascinating piece of work.The film is about sex, love and trust, 3 themes which make up a relationship, abuse them, then your life can be turned upside down. I don't want to say too much about the plot, because there really isn't one as such, there is no goal to the picture, but I think Kubrick wanted us to chew on the themes rather than the story.The performances are very good, both Cruise and Kidman put some effort into their roles. The screenplay at first is a bit disjointed, but smoothes itself out throughout the picture. It's not an award-winning script, it doesn't have the meaty dialogue, but it works.The direction is terrific, as is the photography, beautifully lit.Not Kubrick's best direction, but head and shoulders above anything else in 1999.Overall, this film will not be universally loved, it's not for everyone.I loved it, but it took 2 viewings to understand the picture.",Null,0,1,4 June 2001
Some Like It Hot," Awesome, it really is!
","Sit back and enjoy this comedy, I don't believe in greatest this and that when it comes to films, but boy, this is superb.The acting here is fantastic, all actors, even Monroe are on top form.The direction by Wilder is superb, the guy's style in this picture is perfect. He directed this film in a very clever way, by using one camera for the majority of the scenes, he could easily edit the film together without studio interference.The script is well written. The dialogue between Lemmon and Curtis is beautifully balanced.Monroe is just too hot for the screen in this picture. Although, Monroe had major off-screen problems (83 takes to get things right) she is fantastic on-screen. She may not have the best lines, but what the heck! She plays the role very well.Overall, this is awesome, it really is.",Null,72,113,17 April 2001
Rocky III," Rocky 3 was a missed opportunity
","Rocky 3 is plain predictable, you know what's going to happen and it does. Mr T wasn't directed properly, his character showed promise but there was no script for him. Hogan was okay.There is about 10 minutes of worthwhile watching, and most of that features Mickey, Rocky's trainer.Rocky 3 should've been about the downfall of the character. Rocky could've been a terrific trilogy but instead just became boring.Rocky 1 - this one should've been the the rise of Balboa Rocky 2 - He becomes the champion Rocky 3 - The downfall of RockyNope, instead, Rocky becomes boring and er, boring.",Null,0,1,5 June 2000
It's a Wonderful Life," A Masterpiece
","This is a super, fantastic masterpiece by Frank Capra! I love all Capra pictures, he always put his heart into his films.The story is about George Baily, a guy who is such a nice man, full of warmth but once he gets involved with the dollar sign... Watch the rest.The film's humanity is its strong point, in a world where evil and greed always lurks, it's nice to watch a picture where life can be wonderful and simple.The performances are amazing, nuff said. The direction is perfect and the production values are amazing. Everything is perfect.Thank you Frank Capra.",Null,2,6,25 December 2000
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Excellent Lean mastery
","David Lean will always be an amazing director, he is one of the few who knows how to direct a picture with widescreen lenses. The entire width of the picture used is perfection.The film has a basic plot, it's war picture but not physical and brutal one but more about strong minds and defeating your enemy by brute force of the brain. The film isn't accurate, which is a shame because it could've been even better.The film's cinematography is amazing, the jungle never looked so lush and yet so deadly. The direction is perfection as I've mentioned before, Lean will always be one of the greats.The performances are perfect except that Holden came across a bit too cool, the film almost lost itself with the American stuff.Oliver Twist and Lawrence of Arabia are still my favourite Lean pictures.
Overall, an excellent picture but not Lean's ultimate best.",Null,0,1,25 September 2000
The Green Mile," Wow - This is quality
","3 hours? Yes, and worth every minute. The Green Mile is the perfect companion piece to Shawshank Redemption, this is a wonderful prison picture.Adapted from the King novel, The Green Mile is about miracles, justice and injustice. By the end, you wonder why magical things can happen. It makes you question the death penalty and the whole justice system.The Green Mile is drawn out, the characters are not explored as well as one might think, but the story needed 3 hours to be told, it did that extremely well.The direction by Darabont is perfect, the methodical approach is consistent throughout the film, never rushed.The photography by David Tattersall BSC is perfect. David goes onto lense Star Wars Episode 2.The score is beautiful, one of my favourite Thomas Newman scores. It perfectly backs up the visuals.The acting is 101% perfect, Hanks really fits the picture, as does Michael Clarke Duncan. Everyone is fantastic.Overall, the film needed 3 hours to tell the story, nothing could be cut from this film. Mr Jingles steals the show!Quality stuff.",Null,0,1,7 January 2002
Kingpin," Crude and juvenile; not a bad way to spend 2 hours
","I was surprised, there are some funny moment in this picture. The humour is crude, but man, it's soooo funny at times. Of course, not every joke will work, but the film as a whole is very enjoyable.The story is simple, but I think, Woody Harrleson and Bill Murray make this picture work, they are excellent in their roles. Bill's deadpan humour is fantastic. Woody's character is plain fun as well. The opening sequence in excellent, terrific music, really captures the era nicely.Vanessa Angel is eye candy, plain and simple, her character doesn't have the depth or is interesting but great to look at.Randy Quaid is pretty good, he does his job very well.The film does lose it's way in the last 30 minutes, a shame really, the characters seemed to die. It really needed focus towards the finale.The film does have a message, but you'll need to think about that one when the credits rollTechnically, the film is shot very nicely.An enjoyable picture, nice way to spend 2 hours on a Friday night with your friends.",Null,0,0,22 November 2000
Bring It On," Guilty pleasure - not that bad!
","Being a film snob, I was taken back at how much I enjoyed Bring it on. The film is a notch about the average teen flick. Obviously, there's very little story to eat into! But, the film is a guilty trip of pleasure. How can you turn down Dunst in that cheerleading outfit!The choregraphy is excellent, really top class! The cheerleading songs are quite funny as well!Dunst does a good job with the material, she's very hot in this one! Forget the others, they are just there. Dunst rules the flick!The direction is simplistic, does the job well without over-stretching!Have fun, a guilty pleasure for us snobs!",Null,0,0,15 February 2002
Paths of Glory," Pure class from Kubrick
","This is a terrific anti-war picture by the late great master, Stanley Kubrick.The film focuses on the stupidity of the people who make decisions, yes, the very forces that shoot off instructions. They seek the stars and decorations, to move up in their ranks whilst the ordinary man suffers. This is the dumbest, idiotic part of war. At the end of day, someone has to pay for the glory and it's always the common man.Kubrick delivers a startling picture, his message is clear. The film makes me mad, it provokes anger!Technically, the film is astounding, the trademark tracking shots always amaze me. The battle scenes, albeit shot from one main angle, work extremely well. The cold acting in the film works very well, the French generals' acting was sheer perfection. Kirk Douglas is excellent, as usual.Pure class from Kubrick!",Null,0,0,24 December 2000
Shrek," Doesn't reach the greatness level
","Shrek is an interesting concept but it lacks viewer satisfaction. The lampoon idea is excellent and I found myself laughing at some of the jokes, a dig at Disney?Shrek as a whole is not entirely satisfying, by the end, I was perplexed that the picture was missing a strong character/villain conflict.
Never mind the shortcoming of the villain, Shrek is all about lampoons and the jokes. The picture is entertaining, and Donkey steals the show. Voiced by Eddie Murphy, he brings energy to the character. Mike Myer's Shrek is slightly underwhelming. The CGI is quality, really fantastic.Pixar is still leading the computer animation, Toy Story adventures will be difficult to top. Shrek was a decent effort, but needed  meat to fatten the story and the villain.",Null,0,0,1 December 2001
Ben-Hur," I'm in awe of this epic masterpiece
","I couldn't believe how much I loved this picture. It's an amazing piece of work from the technical to the warm performances.The story is simple, but the symbolisms add so much depth to it. The Jesus story is extremely fascinating, it's not in your face, it's magical and gives the picture a mystical feel. Ben Hur is played perfectly, his hatred for revenge clouds his mind during the events featuring Christ.
There maybe too much sentimentality towards the end, but it works, and gets to you. The famous Chariot Race is STILL amazing.The technical standards are fantastic, the sets, the action set piece, the size of the entire picture is astounding. There are no computers, it's all pure magic from innovative technicians.The direction is very good, the widescreen frame is used superbly. Anyone watching this in full frame is missing 55% of the picture. You've only seen Ben Hur if you have seen it in widescreen.A masterpiece, they don't make them like this anymore.",Null,1,2,9 August 2000
The Sixth Sense," Interesting for first time viewers
","Watch the film, and then read the commentsThe Sixth Sense is an interesting picture, some will figure out the finale quite easily, while others, like me, will figure it in the final few minutes.
The problem with the film is that it hinges too much on the finale which has it given it a status, which I don't think it deserves -'Great Film'. It's not a great film, it's good, but just not great.There are too many plot problems which make the picture wobble on its feet. The problem lies in the script, it really required more thought, because I think 75% of it works, but the 25% really hurts it.The performances are superb, the kid is excellent as is Bruce Willis.This is a film which could've been a masterpiece, but the screenplay lets it down. Still, it's interesting for first time viewers, but the 2nd viewing highlights the plot problems. I didn't have to watch it again.",Null,0,0,1 June 2001
Kagemusha," A Technical Masterpiece but story lacking

The beautiful sun to the dark battles, it's simply amazing. The beautiful red sky, I could go on and on.Unfortuantely, I couldn't connect with the story. I found myself yawning at times. There are moments when the picture seems to lose meaning, the editing seemed delibrate but I didn't connect with it. The acting was fine but maybe a little stiff.Technically, this film is a masterpiece but the story and characters didn't always work for me. It's a film that must be revisited in the future.",Null,2,4,8 August 2000
The Thin Red Line," Excellent film
","The film questions the destruction of our world, our humanity and the effects the war has on soldiers.The film's methodical approach is rather interesting. Look at the beauty that nature has given us, yet we decide to fight and kill our own existence. The film offers a lot, but you must be prepared to watch and listen. The film will reward you if you give it a chance, and I doubt very much that you'll understand it in the first viewing. Give it 2 or 3 chances. I've yet to understand all of the picture but I do think that the director wanted us to distinguish humanity and horror.The direction is stunning as is the photography. The jungle looks alive. It's one of the best looking pictures in recent years, amazing!The performances are excellent.The film doesn't have a strong plot, it's very poetic. There are flaws, I didn't think the picture featured a strong core and the screenplay could've been stronger in parts.Overall, a fascinating picture which requires a lot of attention.",Null,1,2,10 December 2000

The screenplay does lack something, but at the end of the picture, it has served its purpose.The film's 5 characters are perfect, every class had a geek, a sports fanatic, a loser etcetc. Judd Nelson is awesome in this, steals the film.A good film, but never exploited to the max.",Null,0,1,20 February 2001

Born on the Fourth of July," Superb picture!
","Well, I thought this film was superb, a very powerful history lesson for me. I now understand what the American nation went through during the late 60s and 70s.The film tells the story of man who goes through war and comes out blaming everyone else but himself. If you don't serve your country, you don't belong here. Little does he realise, it is taken part in war that is the mistake, he could've been something, instead he becomes just another marine spit out from his country. He expects to be awarded for his bravery, what, to kill? To interfere in a country thousands of miles away. He expects people to love you for that?The Marines seems to be an attractive offer, it's only once you are in war that you realise that it's a pointless exercise.I'm touching the surface here, I don't want to spoil it for you.It's a tough and emotional picture, directed by Oliver Stone who as in NAM. This adds more authentic approach to the film.The performances are superb, even Cruise was excellent. The film isn't perfect, there are moments when it needed better transistions.Technically, this film is amazing, the photography is beautiful, stunning, jaw-dropping. The camera work is fantastic, truely an amateur film-maker's wet dream.You must watch this in wide-screen.A superb film.",Null,0,1,13 November 2000
The Wedding Singer," I love the 1980s but this picture disappoints
","I love the 80s, it seems to be forgotten by a lot of people but believe me, a lot of things happened in the 80s. Unfortuantley, this picture paints the 1980s in an average fashion, the film is dopey. It had potential, but by the end it was a plain bore. There are some genuine funny moments and some nice ideas but the story was a plain bore, we've seen it many times in other films.Adam Sandler actually shows he can act a little, nothing great but serviceable. Then you have Drew Barrymore, she's okay nothing special.Technically, the film is fine, nothing astounding, it's never won awards.The songs were a nice touch, some excellent tracks, but the music should've helped the story more. The director never utilized the songs in a more interesting fashion, we never had the eye candy to tie in with the music.

From Here to Eternity," War rules over us.
","A superb film, superb performances and terrific direction make this mandatory viewing.War is bigger than any single person, when it happens, our lives are put away for a while, the army has a one track mind, to fight the enemy. The male leads in the film are all affected by war. The people they love are put to one side so the man can fight the war, it's almost like there is an inner world in the army, this is the point of no return.There are very different characters in this film, each portraying different personas of the army like the stubborn, and the bully. And then there is the love, is it real or just in the way of the looming war?

The Godfather," This is a masterpiece of epic proportions
","The 70s is my favourite decade of films, a new breed of cinema began and it started with The Godfather and ended with Apocalypse Now, both directed by the master, Coppolla!!! In-between, we had many films, ranging from innovative thrillers to a stunning comic book picture(Superman), from horrors to romance etc etc.Guys and gals, the 1970s was and always will be the decade when cinema had taken a massive change. Don't get me wrong, I love the 40s, 50s, 60s, 80s and 90s, but the decade in question just took a bigger step.The Godfather is storytelling at its finest, it just can't get any better (actually it does in Godfather part2), this film is stunning, amazing, breathtaking and near-perfection.The performances are stunning, every person in the picture is amazing, they really drew me into their world. Marlon Brando is amazing, no one could've made this role work. On paper, Brando's role is simple but the execution could only be done by Marlon.The masterful story-telling crafted by Mario Puzo and Francis Coppolla hit the right notes. Francis directs each scene with stunning authority. The production values are breathtaking, very authentic. Every person on the film deserves a hand. And let's not forget the unforgettable score by Nina Rota.I won't tell you about the story because only the film can do it justice. Just watch it. Always worth watching every year, a film which will take multiple viewings to understand all characters.The saga continues in The Godfather part 2.This is A MASTERPIECE!",Null,1,2,17 December 2000
