The Blair Witch Project," I thought this was done with cannibals and italians in 1979?
","It's a different story, but the same idea as Ruggero Deodato's italian gore classic 'Cannibal Holocaust'. But with any luck this film will do well at the box office and help bring back the 'true' horror film to the theaters. I'd say the last good horror film to hit theaters was 'The Prophecy'(w. Christopher Walken) or maybe 'Halloween Six'(just because of Donald Pleasence). But some say there has not been a good horror film in theaters since 'Day of the Dead'. As far as 'The Blair Witch Project' goes, it is a very well made indie film, that is truly scary. It's diffently not one of the thousand hip teen slasher flicks being released this(or last) year. It markes a return of the true horror film. Not the Hollywood horror formula films we have seen this decade. And yes no Jen Love Hewitt(sp), no rap music, and no Rob Zombie. Wow how different! On a scale of one to ten(ten being the best) I'd give it a eight. Note to film makers, good job with this film, but you could have given a little credit to Mr. Deodato.",8,1,1,19 July 1999
