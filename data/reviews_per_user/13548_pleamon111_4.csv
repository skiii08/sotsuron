The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Two movies one plot!
",I thought this movie was a great movie. My biggest complaint about this movie is I feel like this was a cash grab. Don't get me wrong I think this was a really well done cash grab up but I feel as though the last book Mockingjay part one and two could have been combined into one single movie.With that out of the way I think this was a really good movie. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone. I think that Jennifer Lawrence did a really good job being Katiness Everdeen as the lead in this movie. The acting in this movie was very good all around and I really can't point to an actor and and say they had a bad performance. Some of the people cast in this movie made there roles in this movie more memorable then if it was a different actor. For example Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee and Julianne Moore as President Coin really add something to there roles which might not be present otherwise. The special effects were really good in this movie. I felt like I was really a part of this futuristic world. This was aided by excellent editing by Alan Edward Bell and Mark Yoshikawa. I think the way they cut some of the more dramatic scenes in this movie really increased the suspense.I think this was a great movie and is worth seeing but I think that the reason to make a Mockingjay 1 and 2 instead of just one movie is to make money. Granted 300 million dollars is a lot of money but I think artistically speaking this movie would have been better not split up between part one and two.,8,8,30,29 November 2014
Citizen Kane," Is it as Good at the Hype? Almost
","In all honesty, I went into this movie knowing about how people call it a film classic so I am not looking at this movie as if it was just released yesterday. One of favorite aspect of this movie was how they didn't just tell the story of Kane's life beginning to end as most movies do, the way Welles used Kane's last words 'rosebud' as more of an object through which the rest of plot developed was very interesting. My biggest complaint with the film is that throughout the movie there are several key characters and while brilliantly acted, I never fully understood who they were. If I watched the film over again I would probably understand who everyone was but in my opinion it took something away from the story. These characters were very interesting and each had a different perspective on who Mr. Kane was, I feel that if I could distinguish his account from his best friend I think this would have added more to the experience for me.Another aspect I really enjoyed about the movie was the acting. Although as previously mentioned sometimes it was hard to distinguish who was who, but the performances were still really good. Orson Welles did an amazing job as the rich powerful, but never happy newspaper tycoon, Charles Foster Kane. I really enjoyed seeing how Mr. Kane reacted to money and wealth and how as he gotten older he looked at the world differently. Also Dorothy Comingore who played Susan Alexander Kane had a wonderful performance that really showed the emotional toll of living with Mr. Kane. The way her character developed really highlighted how Mr. Kane changed throughout the film and really added something to the movie.The only other problem I had with the movie is in some parts the movie was slow. This was not a huge part of the movie but some scenes seemed to drag on a little to long.In Conclusion, Is it 'The greatest in cinema history' as some have said? I don't think so. With that being said is it possible that I just didn't appreciate the movie fully. Probably. I think it was well directed, acted, and had an interesting story. I will definitely want to watch the movie again and maybe after a second viewing I will understand its full brilliance. Util then, I think this is a great movie that definitely made cinema history at the time and has only been getting more respected as time goes on. I would definitely recommend you see this move and make your own conclusion.",10,3,4,13 December 2014
Django Unchained," Great Movie, Great acting, maybe a little too bit violent.
","The acting was amazing in this movie. Jamie Foxx does a great job playing Django a slave that with the help of Dr. King Schultz played by Christoph Waltz, is trying to find and save his wife from Calvin Candie played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Broomhilda, Django's wife played by Kerry Washington does a good job as the damsel in distress. She doesn't have a lot of dialogue in the film but she did a fine job acting and really made her scenes count. I think one of the most interesting aspects of the movie is motivation behind Dr. Schultz on one hand he is a bounty hunter and the other he is also against slavery. Throughout the movie I kept asking myself if I was in that situation what would I do? I don't think it is fair to the people who had to experience slavery first hand to know exactly what I would do, but I think this movie forces you to question your own morals about the situations Django finds himself in. Calvin Candie's right hand man in this film and a key antagonist is Stephen played by Samuel L. Jackson. Another interesting relationship is that between Stephen and Django both hold significant power despite being African American and comparing the two is very interesting considering the time period and their roles in society.A major part of this movie was the violence that was prevalent throughout the movie. When I was first watching this movie I thought at some points the violence was excessive and not with purpose. With that being said after watching this movie I feel as the thought the violence is more and more warranted. The more I think about why the violence occurs the more I am OK with the violence. There is no mistaking this movie is a hard R rated and is quite violent. I encourage you to see this movie and decide for yourself if the violence was warranted. The writing was amazing in this film, as this is nothing unusual with a Quentin Tarantino movie. I thought the dialogue was well written and really added a great element to the movie. I really like how this movie looked at some very potent issues of race, killing, and what is 'ok'. There were certain instances where I feel it might have been a little bit too violent or in excess. This doesn't change the fact that this is a movie that looks at hard questions, and let you decide the answers. I really enjoyed Django Unchained and highly recommend it.",8,1,4,15 February 2015
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Changed the way I look at war movies!
","The reason why I gave this movie a 10/10 is because not a movie before or since has shown me war in the same way. I am not implying that I have watched every war movie out there but of the one I have I can honestly say this movie is really unique. This movie is great for a number of reasons but what really makes this movie great in my opinion is that it does not glorify war like some movies (G.I Joe an obvious example) or show the tragedies of war (one example is Full Metal Jacket.) This movies shows war in a totally different light. War is not good or mad but a matter of principle. Both Colonel Nicholson and Colonel Saito are crazy and would rather dying than give in to the other. The struggle between these two for me show that war is not good or bad but a struggle and both you and your enemy are in the same struggle, the struggle to succeed, the struggle to survive. Not everything is black and white.Another dynamic that plays into the movie is that at the same time this bridge is trying to be built the British forces are trying to destroy the bridge. This movie does a really good job of showing different sides to this struggle, not just the POW's side but also who the Japanese commander' side and also the British trying to destroy's side throughout the movie.Lastly, This movie had some amazing performances by Alec Guinness who played Colonel Nicholson, Sessue Hayakawa who played Colonel Saito, but I really enjoyed everyone in this movie and I didn't think this movie had a bad performance. Also this movie had amazing directing by David Lean, editing by Peter Taylor and cinematography by Jack Hildyard. This movie is one of the greatest movies in cinema history. What this movie did that I have never seen before or since was is didn't look at war as good or bad but a struggle.",10,0,1,28 November 2014
