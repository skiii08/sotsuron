Walk the Line," Sharp like a razor, steady like a train.
","I liked last year's 'Ray', and I didn't mind Jamie Foxx taking home the Oscar for Best Actor, but I never thought that the film was as good as many believed; it had a good soundtrack, but, like so many biopics, it failed to really convey the sheer awe that a great artist can inspire. With 'Walk the Line', however, James Mangold has struck a live wire.First, I've never been a huge fan of Johnny Cash or his wife June Carter Cash; I was aware of their music, and knew some of their songs, but I was never a devotee. My favourite Cash performance was his guest voice on 'The Simpsons.' I really can't judge Joaquin Phoenix's performance on its resemblance to the real Cash; all I can say that it is a great performance that works on its own terms. Reese Witherspoon is the same with June; there is an extensive supporting cast of a good actors, especially Waylon Payne as Jerry Lee Lewis (much better than Dennis Quaid).There are several terrific musical sequences in this film, none better than the Phoenix/Witherspoon duet of 'It Ain't Me, Babe' that, for me, betters Dylan's own version (sorry Bob, you got a talent for penning lyrics, but not for singing them).I give 'Walk the Line' a 10/10.",Null,0,1,29 January 2006
The Incredible Hulk," Hulk returns to theatres, with more action and less introspection.
","I just got back; all in all, I'd say pretty good. It's hard to compare it with Hulk '03 as to which is better, since they're very different types of films, but I'd say this definitely meets audience expectations a lot better.Edward Norton was good in the lead part, although, and perhaps this is a deliberate emphasizing of his need to control himself, he rarely seems to get very emotive, even when he's supposed to be really angry.Liv Tyler; I really like her as an actress, performance-wise here I'd say she's a bit weak in the first half and really good in the second. Admittedly, some of that could be that when we first meet her the director spends a bunch of time shooting her in slo-mo with a lot of shots of her looking uncertain/stunned. Starting with the big shootout at the university ('DAAAD!') she won me over.Very effective use of humour; the interruptus scene in the motel room had the audience laughing hysterically.I think they overused the 'Betty calms the Hulk' routine; I count at least three instances, possibly more.The villains, however, I didn't think much of, at least in human form. Tim Roth doesn't convey much menace as Blonsky; this is one instance where the CGI creature works a lot more than the actor (among other things, and I know this is something that can't be helped, he looks like a midget standing next to Ross (ie, pretty much all his scenes)). William Hurt as Ross wasn't nearly as good as Sam Elliot, though, to be fair, the character lacks the depth the first movie gave him. The biggest problem I have with Hurt's Ross, both in terms of writing and acting, is that there's really no sense that he gives a damn about Betty beyond one or two perfunctory expressions; the real conflict in Elliot's Ross made for a much more interesting dynamic.One problem with writing the Hulk and villains is that he inevitably faces them as the Hulk, rather than as Banner, and it's really, really hard to convey any continuity in what the Hulk's personality thinks from transformation to transformation, especially since his expressions in battle are always very simplistic. Lee's Hulk did a really good job of investing the conflict between Banner and the remade Absorbing Man with real weight (it just fell down in the physical aspect, which this movie delivered on).Great action; in terms of the finale, they outdid Iron Man in this respect; I think this is probably the best super-brawl that's yet been filmed in live-action, though (as Ebert pointed out in his review), the lack of any real relationship between Banner and Blonsky prior to the fight means it's mainly just a big fight.Excellent cameo by Stan the Man, which reminded me irresistibly of 'I Am Furious (Yellow)'.I give it an 8/10.",8,2,4,14 June 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," What can be said except for 'awesome'?
","As a prologue, I'll say that the showing of Pirates of the Caribbean 2 that I attended helped remind me why I love going to the theatre while others wait for the DVD. My enjoyment of a movie is heightened when seeing it with a good audience watching as well, and that was one of the best audience experiences I've ever had. You could just feel everyone's enjoyment of the film.In other words: awesome.While it's fun to see Jack and Elizabeth flirt it up a bit, I can't see it going anywhere. Will's too nice a guy to not get the girl in a Hollywood motion picture, even one with a subversive streak.I don't want to start off a wave of Lucas-bashing, but watching the Pirates franchise just shows what he forgot when making the prequel trilogy. Expertly-blending cutting edge effects with real flesh, blood, and scenery, and an expert mix of action, drama, and comedy. The effects don't overwhelm the story, and the story is centered on three actors perfectly cast as the leads (whatever I think of Bloom's talent, he's good as Will, your standard bland, upstanding guy) I think, unless something really stunning appears, this film has the best FX Oscar locked up.I also love that in writing the sequels the production team didn't lose sight of all the little minor characters from the first film: we had Mr. Gibbs (an especially good supporting character), Cotton and his parrot, the dwarf guy, a cameo by the two old girlfriends of Jack at Tortuga, Governor Swann, and Norrington (who gets an especially fitting character arc).And, of course, Pintel and Ragetti, the R2D2 and C3PO of this franchise.I was also amused to see Tom Hollander and Keira Knightley get a few scenes together, reunited from their roles as another Lizzie and Mr. Collins; there really are only about twenty working British actors.The end, with the return of our good friend, had the whole audience cheering.My favourite scene has to be the showdown on the island, with about six different parties fighting for control of the chest; the whole thing is just one joke building on another, with some the finest scoring around (the Pirates main theme is an instant classic), and a bunch of stuff right out of Super Mario Brothers.10/10, just because, after six straight days of working 7/8 hours, I needed such a jolt of fun. Bring on number three!",10,2,4,8 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," An epic adventure; my favourite film of 2003.
","The first time I saw 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' in theatres, in the summer of 2003, I knew that it was the first of many viewings.  I ended up seeing it four times in theatres, and I then acquired the DVD.  PotC is a truly great action-adventure film, perhaps the best pirate movie ever made (although that genre hasn't faired well of late). Johnny Depp does an iconic turn as Jack Sparrow, the bizarre anti-hero that captured the audience's imagination, and earned Depp an Oscar nomination (he should have won, if you asked me).  Sparrow is a truly unique creation, and he overshadows everything else in the film.  Doing his best to match Depp in scenery chewing is Geoffrey Rush, playing another of his memorable villains, Captain Barbossa.  Somewhat more subdued are Orlando Bloom, Jack Davenport, and the stunningly beautiful Keira Knightley (in the role that put her on the map).  Knightley is just about the only woman in the production, but she is a great screen presence; hopefully she will have a long career ahead of her. My favourite scene is the dinner scene onboard the Black Pearl, where Elizabeth sits down with Barbossa and he gives her food to eat; unable to enjoy the food himself, Barbossa draws an absurd amount of enjoyment from watching her eat and drink; he then follows it up with an excellent monologue, one of the most memorable film speeches I've ever seen. I give 'Pirates of the Caribbean' a 10/10.",10,1,3,25 August 2004
Spider-Man 2," The Spectacular Spider-Man
","I biked to the theatre in the baking heat to get two tickets because I feared it would be sold out by the time it was actually time to go see the movie. My father had taken the van I drive because he needed the space. Later, my friend's job meant that he couldn't go with me, but I got a refund on his ticket. Then I arrived and there was only a couple of people there, so my long bike ride was for nothing. I got rained on as I left the theatre, and I hadn't brought a coat. Then when I got home after the movie, I saw that my dog Marco Polo had vented the contents of his bowels while I was away (mostly on the tiled floor, luckily enough).In between the hardships was an excellent movie. Doctor Octopus was an excellent villain. Those mechanical arms were scary to watch. They jump out from all over the place, like snakes. The idea that the arms are sentient seemed new to me, though. Was that in the comics? The world of Spider-Man is quite in tact. Acting is uniformly great. The fight scenes (and by extension, the CGI) was much improved, although I never had as much a problem with Film 1's effects as so many others seemed to. My favourite fight scene is the one at the bank; Aunt May is a tough old lady. J.K. Simmons is still right on as Jameson, although I didn't find him as funny this time around. The 'New Yorkers stick up for Spider Man' scene was much more believable this time around. And more moving. A major problem I had with the resolution to the Peter/MJ situation was how MJ dealt with John. I really couldn't cheer when Peter and MJ kissed because I kept thinking about John, left alone at the altar, in front of all those people. John seemed to be a totally nice guy, and the way MJ handled the breakup was really off-putting. I kept thinking 'What a bitch!' instead of 'Yes! She loves Peter!'. My favourite moment in Spider-Man 2 doesn't involve any of the principle actors. When the garbage man brings Spidey's costume to Jameson, Bill Nunn as Robbie Robertson steals the movie. The look on his face and the way he held the mask was heartbreaking. That Raimi so effectively translated that bit player from the comics to the screen is greatly to his credit. Also, Dylan Baker, Donna Murphy, Mageina Tovah (Glynis on Joan of Arcadia), Bruce Campbell, and Daniel Dae Kim (I get the impression there was more to his part) all put in brief appearances. Did anyone else, while watching the awesome opening credits, think 'Previously, on Spider-Man.'? There were a lot of parallelisms with the first film; the roof jumping sequence, Harry's talk with Dad in the mirror, rescuing the person from the fiery building, etc. All in all, 10/10.",10,0,0,30 June 2004
Superbad," Another winning film from Apatow's crew.
","'Superbad' is a notable production in that it was first imagined when its writers were 13, and wanted to see if they could write a movie; based on the finished project (which, sure, has undergone numerous reworkings in the intervening years), I believe the answer is clearly 'yes'. 'Superbad' has the plot of a typical teen movie, pitting two unpopular nerds and their reluctant acquaintance against the whole world in a desperate attempt to acquire the liquor to facilitate their receiving some action from the chosen ladies (who are far out of their league, at least in one case; this is a recurring thing in Apatow films, especially considering that the Seth character in this film is modeled on co-writer Seth Rogen, who was in a similar situation in 'Knocked Up').Like its Apatow kin, the film manages to mix crude humour in with genuine feeling, and does not mock (at least, not without love) its characters or deny them some dimensionality. In particular, I enjoyed the handling of the two main female characters who are the object of so much desire; neither fills a standard teen movie stereotype (no cheerleaders or prom queens here), and the expected roles are in a lot of ways reversed.It's not a great or significant film, but then, you weren't expecting that kind of production from 'Superbad'; this is a great bit of fun, if you can take the swearing.",8,1,4,4 September 2007
Brokeback Mountain," Good, but not the year's best film.
","Buried under an avalanche of praise from critics and moviegoers, there is a real film called 'Brokeback Mountain;' it is a moving story of missed opportunities, small moments of happiness, set against a backdrop of confusion, homophobia, and general unhappiness. It is a good movie, with fine performances, a thoughtful script, and involving direction; however, it is probably not a great movie, or the year's best film, or a milestone in the history of cinema. This fact will not prevent many from viewing it that way. That's fine.I subscribe to James Berardinelli's view of the film: that audiences, in an effort to rebuff the hateful words of some right-wingers, have over-hyped 'Brokeback Mountain', making something beyond what it is. It is a good movie, however, and I recommend it to anyone with an interest in these kinds of tragic stories. Michelle Williams should be singled out for her especially good work, and Linda Cardellini is great in a small role.",8,3,10,29 January 2006
Juno," One of my favourite films of 2007.
","Every so often, a little independent film produced on a shoestring budget becomes a critical and box office hit, propelling its star into the spotlight. The most recent example of this would be 'Little Miss Sunshine', which eventually secured an Oscar for veteran supporting actor Alan Arkin (with a little help from 'Norbit'). 'Juno' follows in the footsteps of that film, but it earns considerable marks for being much, much less annoying.The story is about the title character, Juno, a teenaged girl who gets pregnant after having sex for the first time with her friend Bleeker (Michael Cera, best known for the TV series 'Arrested Development' and the hit film 'Superbad'), and decides to keep the baby after an abortive visit to an abortion clinic. She picks Vanessa and Mark Loring (Jennifer Garner, from the great TV series 'Alias', and Jason Bateman, also from 'Arrested Development') as the adoptive family for her child. One of the notable things about 'Juno' is that, until the third act, there really isn't much in the way of dramatic conflict; Juno's parents (J. K. Simmons, best known as J. Jonah Jameson in the 'Spider-Man' films, and the invaluable Allison Janney of 'The West Wing') are unconventionally accepting of this development, and do no become the needlessly confrontational figures so often seen in films like this. When the real drama comes, it involves Juno and the Lorings, particularly the prospective adoptive father.The performance of actress (and Atlantic Canadian; woot!) Ellen Page has attracted most of the critical attention, including an Oscar nomination for Best Actress that she may very well win. It is indeed an impressive performance, worthy of the award. Also impressive is Jennifer Garner, a favourite actress of mine, who takes a yuppie stereotype and injects it with humanity and vulnerability. The rest of the cast is also strong.The sole sour note, in my opinion, is the soundtrack, which is composed entirely of annoying indie acoustic music with pretentiously nonsensical lyrics. This is one area where I'd have preferred a more traditional approach.'Juno' is often grouped with 'Waitress' and 'Knocked Up' as a trio of 2007 pregnancy comedies where unplanned pregnancies are taken to term; the politics of this has been debated in some circles. In my opinion, 'Juno' argues that while abortion should be available, it is a practice that many find unacceptable, even if they are open in principle to it (it also rather prominently mocks pro-life protesters) ('Waitress' I would characterize as more clearly pro-life, at least in the perspective of the main character, although that is also a choice).Anyway, this is a very enjoyable film, and highly recommended.",9,2,7,29 January 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," A joy to watch.
","I saw the first 'Pirates' film four times in theatres in the summer of 2003; it was one of my all-time favourite film experiences, and its first sequel joined that illustrious group, almost matching its precedessor in pure fun and entertainment. I'm glad to say, having seen the second sequel, it is similarly entertaining. Many people and critics have fallen out of love with the sequels, but I love the films as much as ever.First and foremost, I love the incredibly complicated mythology that the screenwriters have cooked up, much of it on the fly. The film introduces a lot of major plot elements that were not previously mentioned, including a whole pirate hierarchy (that does play on some information given in previous films), and, in spite of itself, it all just works. There are so many balls in the air, and so many running jokes, that it all amounts to an overstuffed joy on the screen. You have to pay attention, but it's not nearly so complicated as many critics would have you believe; perhaps they were just expecting to be able to switch off their brains in a summer movie.The cast is simply brilliant, from Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow right on down to the two guys who play the goofy comic relief British soldiers from the first film. In particular, it is great to have Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa (first name Hector, we learn) back, as he adds immeasurable hilarity to the proceedings.I could go on and on about this film, but sufficed to say, I loved it.",10,1,1,4 September 2007
X-Men," The start of a new era of comic book movies.
","In the year 2000, the comic book movie was all but dead; the but being the 'Blade' movies.  Director Joel Schumacher, in making the spectacular flop of 'Batman and Robin', had seemingly doomed the genre.  But a new champion arose, a Marvel champion, in the form of director Bryan Singer's 'X-Men'. Long had Marvel been bequeathed the short end of the stick, with DC Comics making all the successful movies.  The box office success of 'X-Men' opened the doors to sequels, adaptations of 'Spider-Man', 'The Hulk', 'Daredevil', 'The Fantastic Four', 'Punisher', and spurred DC's efforts to revive its ailing 'Batman' and 'Superman' franchises. Singer, more of an arthouse filmmaker than a commercial one, had assembled an all but perfect cast to play his legendary comic book characters. Patrick Stewart (a personal favourite, since I count myself a diehard Trekker) as Professor Xavier, the mutant who sought cooperation; Ian McKellen (soon to play Gandalf) as his opposite number Magneto, who believed mutants must make their own way; breakout star Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, haunted by flashes of his unknown past; Anna Paquin as Rogue, the girl for whom physical interaction with others was impossible; Famke Janssen as Jean Grey, Xavier's telekinetic right hand; James Marsden as Cyclops, the brave field commander of the X-Men; Bruce Davison as the misguided McCarthyite Senator Kelly, who saw the light before his end; Rebecca Romijn as Magneto's henchman, Mystique; and, perhaps the only fly in the ointment, Halle Berry as weather god Storm. And for all of this, X-Men is only an average film.  It isn't nearly as action-heavy as most comic book movies, and it is burdened by introducing so many characters.  I rate it a 7/10. But for all its flaws, it revolutionized the comic book movie genre, making the making of greater films (like its sequel, X2) possible.",9,0,0,9 August 2004
Spider-Man 3," A strong finish, although there are several flaws.
","Various reviews have mentioned the butler scene, which totally took me out of the film. However, perhaps even bigger than the problem of where this guy was while Harry wasted years on a mission of vengeance, a more fundamental problem is: what exactly does his testimony actually prove? So Osborne was impaled by his own glider; that doesn't mean anything; later on, Harry is impaled by his own glider; did Harry kill himself? Aside from the butler, most of this movie works quite well; the parts that don't basically all involve the Sandman, who is quite well-acted, but totally unnecessary. The retcon with Uncle Ben just sticks out as unnecessary. The ending is just weird; sure, he's repentant, but he's probably put four-score people in critical care, and caused millions of dollars in property damage (of course, perhaps Spidey just didn't have the energy to stop him at that point). Sandman should have been left out in favour of Harry and Venom. The Sandman's whole plot (criminal, sick daughter, superpowers) reminded me more of Scott Lang than anything else, although Lang became a hero (albeit by stealing).Pretty much everything else works great. James Franco is excellent; he was rather awkward in the previous two.One of the things that I really liked was the large, large cast of characters; to have Connors drop in for the film equivalent of two panels, and Captain Stacy, and the whole Bugle cast, etc., just is terrific for replicating the feel of a comic, where appearances of characters cost nothing.The 'emo-Spidey' scenes are played outrageously broadly, which I think is the point: it's goofy, laughable, until the ending scuffle, at which point the movie crashes down to earth. I really liked how it was handled. It's amusing how they cast natural blonde Dunst as redhead MJ, and then hired natural redhead Howard as blonde Gwen.Eddie Brock is handled very well; although I'm not sure how the movie wants us to feel about his firing from the Bugle; sure, Peter was a bit of a jerk, but professionally speaking he did absolutely the right thing: Brock falsified, and he deserved to go down (not to mention smearing Spider-Man's reputation for no reason).The ending is quite appropriate; I was afraid they'd have him propose or something like that, but instead we just get a ray of hope that they can work things out.In the end, it's a tremendously ambitious film; it falls down in a couple of places, but I'll give it a 9/10. It was very entertaining.",9,2,4,6 May 2007
Match Point," Well, it's safe to assume that Woody thinks life is a tragedy.
","Woody Allen's most recent film 'Match Point' finally arrived in the theatre here this week, and I saw it last night. Everyone was talking about how this was Allen's best film in years (some say since 1989). While I haven't seen much of Allen's work, I thought this was a great movie.Plotwise, it plays like 'Crimes & Misdemeanors' distilled to only the Martin Landau plot, without the Woody Allen/Alan Alda comic plot interlaced. In both movies, a successful man is having an affair, and when the mistress won't keep quiet, ponders whether he should kill her to cover up his secret. This could be called derivative, but I actually liked it more than C & M, because the Martin Landau plot is by far the more interesting of the two. In MP, Jonathon Rhys Meyers plays the Martin Landau role (philandering spouse), Scarlett Johanssen is Anjelica Huston, and Emily Mortimer plays the wife role (Claire Bloom in C & M, but Mortimer's role is at least three times larger). While C & M was a very intellectual meditation on whether or not God exists, MP is about how much of our lives are determined by totally random, often implausible factors that we can't control.For instance, both movies have fundamentally the same ending: the murder is carried out, and while some suspicion falls on Landau/Meyers, they ultimately get away with it, and, even more horrifically, they each reach an accommodation with themselves, accepting their decision. As well, another person is fingered for the murder. This happens in both cases, but how it happens and how it is played is different. The details of how Martin Landau gets off are essentially unimportant, since the focal point of the film is whether he can accept what he has done. However, MP has an extended epilogue to the murder where we see how random events (including one really brilliant twist on something that had earlier seemed a visual flourish) allow Meyers to get away with the crime.Ultimately, Chris (Meyers) and his oblivious wife Chloe (Emily Mortimer, terrific) conceive a child, and Chris gets another promotion in the company owned by Chloe's father (Brian Cox, essentially the same 'nice dad' roll he played in 'Red Eye').I'd recommend that anyone who likes thrillers (honestly, it would be impossible to guess Allen had directed this if his name wasn't on it), or Woody Allen movies.",10,0,1,3 April 2006
The Prestige," A marvelously intricate construction.
","Christopher Nolan's previous films show him to be a master of plotting and misdirection, even in a relatively straightforward superhero film like 'Batman Begins.' Here, with Batman and Wolverine headlining his production (Batman, amusingly, plays a character named Alfred), he weaves another elaborate mystery set in Victorian Britain, as two stage magicians vie for prominence (when I first heard about this film, it reminded me of the novel 'Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell', which was set in the Regency). Bale and Jackman bring little trace of their previous roles (especially Jackman), and have able support from Michael Caine, Scarlett Johanssen (in a rather throwaway part), and Rebecca Hall. However, the real surprise of the film is an astonishing performance from David Bowie as inventor Nikola Tesla; Bowie is incredible in this part, and one almost wishes for a movie about him. Much like a J.K. Rowling novel, the delight of this movie is the way in which Nolan scatters numerous clues to what is really going on through the proceedings, only to pull out a series of fantastic plot twists the cast a whole new light on everything we've see happen previous to this. There are several huge twists at the end of this film, any one of which alone would seem to be enough, until Nolan contorts the plot again, and things still hold together. I highly recommend this stellar production.",10,3,5,30 October 2006
Ocean's Twelve," The best sequel to a remake since 'Father of the Bride II' (I mean that as a compliment)
","'Ocean's Twelve' is an interesting film to consider, and has many reasons to like it and many reasons to dislike it. Pros include the superb cast and the breezy and entertaining way in which Steven Soderbergh shoots the film. The Cons center around the plotting, which is often hard to believe. Whether or not you like the movie depends on which you value more: superficial entertainment value and beautiful people, or a plot (if the latter, you must not enjoy many movies). I personally was very entertained by the movie. The cast was what made the film, especially Catherine Zeta-Jones, Matt Damon, and Julia Roberts. Zeta-Jones is the main newcomer, and does very well, not to mention being extremely sexy. Matt Damon and Julia Roberts provide the most laughs; Roberts in particular has a hysterical sequence where her character Tess is called upon to impersonate Julia Roberts. I give the film an 8/10. If, while promoting 'Ocean's Twelve', Soderbergh in taken by a particular location and decides to do 'Ocean's Thirteen', count me in.",8,3,7,11 December 2004
Knocked Up," Apatow is the king of crude but kind comedy
","Judd Apatow's movies have gained a reputation for being extremely vulgar and uncouth in their humour, while at the same time containing a core of genuine emotional weight and sympathy, and this has proved to be a winning combination with audiences, who have made three Apatow-backed, R-rated productions into 100+ million dollar hits in the last two years (although the third, 'Superbad', has somewhat less involvement from Apatow himself, instead being a production made by his reliable company of actors, including Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill).This, the second of the three Apatow films, takes Rogen, a supporting character from 'The 40-Year-Old Virgin', and makes him the leading man, rather implausibly (on purpose) paired up with the beautiful and winning Katherine Heigl ('Grey's Anatomy'), who plays a beautiful up-and-coming reporter who is quite clearly out of Rogen's league (a similar situation was faced by the Seth character in 'Superbad', incidentally). This sort of mismatched, accidental relationship has been done a thousand times before, but rarely this winningly. Rogen demonstrates promise as a real romantic lead, not just as a brilliant frat comedian, while Heigl makes her character's interest in Ben (Rogen's character) seem reasonable. Also notable in the supporting cast is the always-charming Paul Rudd, who plays Heigl's character's brother-in-law, whose marriage is a sort of worst-case-scenario for the movie's main couple.Bonus points for Rogen playing an actual Canadian character on film, which one rarely sees when my country's great comics head south of the 49th Parallel.",9,1,3,4 September 2007
Closer," Love takes a holiday.
","Mike Nichols ('Angels in America') directs this adaptation of Patrick Marber's stage play, starring Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Natalie Portman, and Clive Owen. One can easily see the play's theatrical origins, given its focus on dialog and the existence of only four real characters. 'Closer' is a sexually graphic (mostly in terms of dialog) film, and contains four superb performances, especially from Clive Owen and Natalie Portman. Roberts and Law, the real movie stars, give very good performances, but they're outdone by their lesser-known costars. Clive Owen really steals the show, as the brutish Larry. Given that all four characters are horrible individuals, one can't help but root for the one who seems to be enjoying it the most.",8,1,3,26 February 2005
Capote," An intellectually engaging experience.
","This biopic of the eccentric American author Truman Capote focuses all its attention on the years between 1959 and 1965, when Capote toiled on his nonfiction novel 'In Cold Blood,' the groundbreaking portrait of two murderers in the heartland of America. In a much-lauded performance, Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Truman Capote, making his extremely affected mannerisms quite compelling, and eventually unnoticeable. It's a terrific performance. However, Hoffman's character is really the only person in the film whose personality is really developed; Catherine Keener, Bruce Greenwood (for once not cast as a villain), Chris Cooper, and Clifton Collins ,Jr. all flit through the picture, giving solid performances, but none receives enough screen time to really matter. Keener, in particular, is receiving many awards and nominations for a performance that, quite frankly, doesn't get enough development (no slight to Keener, who is a wonderful performer). I liked 'Capote', but I think it would have benefited from expanding its focus onto the wide range of secondary characters that exist in the film. There's little emotional resonance to the events the occur; my appreciation for it was primarily intellectual.",8,0,0,29 January 2006
Fargo," A disappointingly ordinary film.
","'Fargo' is frequently called the best film ever made by the Coen Brothers, but I must resolutely veto this notion. How people can consider this superior to 'Miller's Crossing' or 'The Hudsucker Proxy' I'll never understand. The film tells the story of Jerry (William H. Macy, playing his standard pathetic loser), who arranges to have his own wife kidnapped by two goons (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare, as their standard characters, a foul-mouthed weasel and a taciturn thug), in order to get the money needed to pay off his debts. Things go wrong, and police officer Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) is on the case. The film won two Oscars in 1997, Best Screenplay and Best Actress (McDormand); I must say that it didn't deserve either of them. In particular, I found McDormand's performance incredibly overrated. Margie is a cartoon character, and nothing more. I give this film a disappointing 5/10.",5,2,5,4 March 2005
The Aviator," The Katharine Hepburn Show.
","Before Howard Hughes was a recluse so reclusive as to out-Salinger J.D. Salinger, he was a big time stud, who made big movies, flew fast planes, and courted gorgeous ladies; so say Martin Scorsese and John Logan, architects of this latest Hollywood biopic.' Leonardo DiCaprio continues his trend of turning in great performances with great directors, playing Howard Hughes between 1927 and 1947, the years where Hughes conquered the worlds of film and aviation, making room for romance with Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale). In later years, Hughes's mental problems would become legendary; at this stage in the game, he suffers only from pronounced germ phobia and mild obsessive-compulsive disorder. This is all expertly depicted by Scorsese, Logan, and DiCaprio. Stealing all her scenes is Cate Blanchett, who should start making room on her mantle for her Best Supporting Actress Oscar. It couldn't have been easy to play an iconic movie star like Katharine Hepburn, but Blanchett aces it. Kate Beckinsale, Kelli Garner (Faith Demorgue), and Gwen Stefani (Jean Harlow) are the other women in Howard's life, although none are as clearly defined as Blanchett/Hepburn. The villains of the piece are Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda, playing, respectively, Pan-American Airways CEO Juan Trippe and Trippe's bought-and-paid-for politician, Senator Ralph Owen Brewster. Both excel, with Alda coming off as both slimy and goofy at the same time. Alec Baldwin, like Cate Blanchett, steals every scene he has, playing Trippe as a delightfully suave villain. In his final scene he delivers a wonderful monologue on the future of Hughes's Trans-World Airline, and caps it off with the most hysterical use of the F word in many years. Also appearing: the dependable John C. Reilly as Hughes's business manager Noah Dietrich; Jude Law, who apparently can't go two weeks without seeing himself in a different movie, as movie legend Errol Flynn; Brent Spiner (yay!) as airplane executive Robert Gross; and Willem Dafoe as a photographer. 'The Aviator' is overlong, and drags in places, but it is a great movie. I rate it a 9/10.",9,203,332,26 December 2004
Dreamgirls," A decent adaptation, but no 'Chicago.'
","A few years ago, there were many predictions that the movie musical was going to make a triumphant return, after several decades confined largely to Disney animated productions (even Disney has gotten out of the habit of employing music in its productions, sadly). 'Chicago' won the Oscar for Best Picture (enraging many LOTR fans, but since the production crew got their just deserts for the third film, it doesn't bother me; one Oscar is enough), and 'Moulin Rouge' was also successful. However, the momentum stalled after that; now, 'Dreamgirls' gamely attempts to restart things, with 'Chicago''s writer onboard as director as well. The results are good, but not at the level of 2002's Best Picture.I won't recap the story, other than to say it is a fairly straight-up adaptation of the history of 'The Supremes', with a happier ending for the ousted original lead singer. Said singer is played by Jennifer Hudson, who was apparently on 'American Idol,' a show I've never watched more than five minutes of, so I wouldn't know; she has won rave reviews for this performance, and an Oscar nomination. She's fine, but nothing spectacular (as opposed to Catherine Zeta-Jones as Velma), and her big musical number verges on incomprehensible on a number of points. Speaking of the music, this is my biggest problem with the film, for two reasons (and this is a musical, so issues with the music present a considerable problem): (1) the film initially appears to be adopting the 'Chicago' approach of not having the characters spontaneously burst out into song, but find some other outlet for music (in this case, it's a film about singers, as opposed to 'Chicago''s creative fantasies); however, things abruptly switch over to spontaneous song, and, quite frankly, I don't think it works; it doesn't help that the lines continue to blur between stage and spontaneity throughout the film. (2) The music is just not that memorable. I walked out of 'Chicago' humming about half a dozen songs, and bought the soundtrack. There's not one song from the proceedings that I really remember.I've already talked about Hudson, so the rest of the cast deserves mention. Jamie Foxx is fine, although he never ever sings, which seems rather odd. Beyonce Knowles' casting as the Diana Ross character is fascinating, given that it speaks to her own history as the breakout star of the black female threesome 'Destiny's Child;' her acting is fine, and her singing is great. Eddie Murphy, the film's other Oscar nominee, gives an excellent performance, and he can sing.I'd say a 7 out of 10 is appropriate.",7,2,4,28 January 2007
Collateral," Los Angeles After Dark
","Director Michael Mann teams up with Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx to make his latest stylish thriller, the first film of his that I've seen in theatres. The heart of this film is Jamie Foxx, displaying acting skills far in excess of what I would have credited him with; I'm now even more interested to see his portrayal of Ray Charles.  Tom Cruise is also playing against type, as a nihilistic assassin.  Cruise is also good, although the role offers him little to do other than act like a villainous badass.  Jada Pinkett Smith, Peter Berg, Bruce McGill, and an unrecognizable Mark Ruffalo are all fine in supporting roles.  The movie is clearly Foxx's, however, as the audience identifies primarily with his terrified taxi driver. Mann's direction of Collateral is excellent, shooting with digital film that allows Los Angeles to look like it never has before.  Bravo, Mr. Mann.  And Mr. Cruise.  And Mr. Foxx.",8,0,0,7 August 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Rich, atmospheric, and one hell of a ride.
","Chris Columbus's two Harry Potter films were good, and they did a fine job of setting up the Harry Potter universe; but there was something missing from those films. They both lacked a style of their own. Now comes Alfonso Cuaron, whose Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban has style to burn, as well as plenty of substance. Screenwriter Steven Kloves makes many noticeable changes to J.K. Rowling's masterful novel, and the result is a great script. Kloves brings in his own dialogue, and it works; there are plenty of great one-liners. Several subplots had to go to make the film fit (I missed the Quidditch Cup storyline most of all), but it was all for the best. Among the regular castmembers, Emma Watson continues to be the big discovery of this series. Hermione was already my favourite character in the books, but Watson takes the character several steps higher. Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint also do great work here. Michael Gambon is great as Albus Dumbledore, bringing to the screen the quirkiness and uniqueness that was largely absent from Richard Harris's portrayal of the Headmaster (no offense is meant to Harris, who was in the twilight of his life at the time, and seemed too tired). David Thewlis is wonderful as Professor Remus Lupin, although I hadn't pictured Lupin as having a moustache. Gary Oldman, likewise, is excellent as Sirius Black.",10,0,0,5 June 2004
The Duchess," A fine period drama.
","A lot of people think of British period drama as stuffy and boring, a reputation it occasionally does something to deserve, but history is anything but dull, and if you were under the impression that the past was a place of strong moral values and happy marriages that has given way to our current immoral society full of single parents and extramarital affairs, think again. Consider the subject of the life of Georgiana Spenser Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire (Keira Knightley).Married young by her mother (Charlotte Rampling, in a wonderfully controlled performance) to William Cavendish, Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes), the foremost peer of the realm, she finds quickly that her husband (who she met only twice beforehand) is a cold and distant fellow who is only interested in a male heir. Already tasked to mother his bastard daughter Charlotte, she gives birth to two daughters, to the disgust of the Duke, who has a series of mistresses that she tolerates. The Duchess becomes a social marvel, hobnobbing with Whig politicians like Charles James Fox (Simon McBurney) and Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper, later 2nd Earl Grey and Prime Minister) and politician/esteemed playwright Richard Sheridan (Aidan McArdle), whose 'School for Scandal' was based heavily on the Cavendishes' marriage. She eventually finds a close friend in Lady Elizabeth (Bess) Foster (Hayley Atwell), and invites her to live with them, which turns out to have dangerous consequences when the Duke initiates an affair with her, and refuses to expel her. She then finds herself living in a forced menage a trois (subtle humour found in the three of them eating silent breakfasts together). Understandably, she finds herself increasingly drawn to Grey.The dramatic core of 'The Duchess' is an examination of the limited social prospects for women in this period (though, as an aside, one imagines a great many poor women from this period would gladly enter a loveless marriage to live like Georgiana does), and their limited legal rights. Both Bess and Georgiana face adulterous husbands who hold over them the prospect of never seeing their children again as a price of leaving; getting her children back is, indeed, Bess's motive for embarking on her affair with the Duke, who, as a powerful lord, is easily able to finagle it. Georgiana, likewise, initially decides to choose freedom over her daughters, but cannot. The Duke, for his part, is a controlling fellow, raised in a very patriarchal worldview; Fiennes expertly shows his emotional straitjacketing, which at odd moments make him mildly sympathetic, though he mostly is not, particularly at the conception of his long-desired son. He's normally at a loss when called to talk about feelings.Keira Knightley, once again travelling back in time to the 18th century (her fifth or sixth visit, I believe), does a fine job as Georgiana. Hayley Atwell is likewise very good as Bess, a character who walks the finest line between sympathy and dislike from the audience. There's a curious scene included which seems to suggest at a rather different dynamic between the two women, though this doesn't go anywhere. Fiennes, as mentioned, does his best in a rather staid role. Dominic Cooper as the young semi-radical Grey is suitable, though not of the same calibre as the other actors. McBurney and McArdle are scene-stealers in small parts as Georgiana's sympathetic male acquaintances. The set design, as one would expect, is stunning.While not in the highest tier of British period pieces, this is a fine addition to the genre.",8,1,1,7 December 2008
No Country for Old Men," Excellent most of the way through, but with a doubtful ending.
","The Coen Brothers, after a decade of middling productions following the (highly overrated, in my opinion) 'Fargo', hit a major success in 2007 with their adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel. It racked up awards, ultimately winning Best Picture at the Academy Awards, among other Oscars. I did not see it until February 2008, when in arrived in theatres on Prince Edward Island.The film functions on two levels: the first is as a pure thriller, and on that level it is an all-but-unqualified success. The Coens are tremendous filmmakers on a technical level, and so they are able to conjure up a series of stunningly tense set-pieces, pitting various characters against Javier Bardem's stone-cold killer Anton Chigurh. One, particularly, is brilliant: Josh Brolin's character, Llewelyn Mars, sits in his motel room, having found the tracking device placed on his person, and listens as the ominous beeping of the tracking device (which the audience has previously observed in action) approaches: the audience is on pins and needles. A great thriller needs a great villain, and Chigurh is as good a filmic foe as I have seen in many years. He is determined, and his ability to continually keep on the trail of his opponents and absorb pan is almost Schwarzeneggerian. The Coens supply him with some grisly signature weapons as well, from a nasty-looking gun to the prominent air-fired cattlegun. Bardem's performance is quite intimidating. Elsewhere, Josh Brolin and Kelly Macdonald are strong as as his most prominent targets (the latter has a particularly fine scene right at the end).Then there is the second level, that of a more existential drama, and on that level I am less certain. There are issues of fate, chance, and the like in play here, and the nature of evil (incarnated in Chigurh), and none are really resolved, or, as far as I can see, amount to much. The title refers to Tommy Lee Jones' character's belief that the world is becoming less and less civilized as time passes. However, the movie welcomely bucks this, as Jones' elderly uncle relates that the world has always been a cruel and hard place, and criticizes his 'vanity' at thinking he could really change it. The end is inconclusive, and I could tell that many of the audience in the theatre were not satisfied by the movie's climax (which basically avoids anything climactic). The 'evil wins' motif is rather banal.This is a gripping film experience most of the way through, but the ending does not work as the ending of a thriller, and I never found the other themes particularly well-developed; ultimately, I give it a seven, since it is still first-rate most of the way through, and I know a great many people saw more in the movie then I did.",7,0,2,16 August 2008
Batman Begins," The dark knight returns in style.
","As every review of 'Batman Begins' mentions, the Batman franchise self-destructed eight years previous when Joel Schumacher's 'Batman and Robin' turned out to be an unmitigated disaster. The campy elements of the franchise had overrun Schumacher's two films, and now the studio turns to virtuoso indie director Christopher Nolan and 'Blade' screenwriter David Goyer to revive their classic superhero. Marvel Comics heroes have been ruling the screen for the last several years, and now it's only fitting that DC get in on the act. Christian Bale picks up the role previously essayed by Adam West, Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, and George Clooney, playing a younger and much more dramatic Bruce Wayne/Batman than any of the other actors had (although Adam West's series retains its campy nostalgia value). As is fashionable these days, a young rising star is surrounded by a phalanx of veterans performers: Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Ken Watanabe, and Tom Wilkinson have between them three Oscars and a further ten Oscar nominations. Add to that Rutger Hauer, Cillian Murphy, and Katie Holmes, who does surprisingly well with her role, and you have perhaps the best cast assembled for any film this year. Gotham City is no longer the twisted, stylized metropolis of past Batman films, but a relatively normal city, which adds to 'Begins''s authentic feel, much like Bryan Singer's 'X-Men' movies. My one complaint has to do with the way Nolan chooses to shoot the hand-to-hand fights, which is in extreme closeups and rapid editing that makes it difficult to understand what is happening. The fights could have benefited from a more remote vantage point and less frenetic editing. Regardless, this adventure gets a 10/10.",10,8,14,16 June 2005
Before Sunset," Utterly majestic.
","In 1995, director Richard Linklater released a little romantic comedy called Before Sunrise, which made only 5 million dollars, but became a cult favourite on VHS/DVD.  Nearly a decade later, Linklater reunites with the film's stars (Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawk) to produce this sequel.  The motive clearly wasn't financial, given the rather limited success of the original; this was a labour of love for all involved.  I haven't seen the original film, but having seen the sequel, it has now become a major priority.  I must see where this all began. The plot is minimalist.  Jesse (Hawk) is now a successful writer, and is touring Paris when he encounters Celine (Delpy).  Jesse and Celine wander around the city for an hour and a bit, with Jesse's imminent departure the film's ticking clock.  The plot is not the point; this film relies on dialogue and the strength of the two actors' performances.  French actress Julie Delpy is truly radiant as Celine, instantly becoming one of my favourite actresses.  Ethan Hawk, who has done little work seen by me since Dead Poets Society, is also great as Jesse.  No other actor has more then a couple of lines. The dialogue of Before Sunset is wonderful, all of it feeling natural, never forced. Like the first film, the ending of this film is open-ended, although there is a very obvious (and correct) direction for series to take.  Bring on Before_______.",10,0,0,2 September 2004
X-Men: The Last Stand," A fine conclusion.
","Many fans of the cinematic X-Men were against 'X-Men: The Last Stand' before it was even released. This was, in large part, due to the non-involvement of original director Bryan Singer, and his replacement by studio director Brett Ratner. While Ratner is not a creative talent of Singer's skill, it's my opinion that most of the flaws in this production predate Ratner's involvement, as they mostly pertain to the scripting phase, conducted under the direction of studio executives and Matthew Vaughn. In any event, the flaws detract, but do not cripple the film.Fans will always speculate about Singer's potential storyline, and, almost unanimously, will conclude it would have been superior. Leave that to other fans; the plotting of this film works quite well, although those who say the movie could have used another half-hour are quite accurate in saying so. The mutant cure plot and the Dark Phoenix story compliment each other suitably, and it all comes together for a terrific finale, including the finest superhero brawl ever filmed.Arguably, the production's big flaw predates Ratner by two films: Halle Berry as Storm, who continues to prove anemic and a sour note. Berry's amplified role in X3 only serves to cast further light on this. Luckily, stalwarts like Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, and Patrick Stewart are on hand, as well as newcomers like Kelsey Grammar (who's the real McCoy, if I am to be allowed the pun) and Ellen Page (the third Shadowcat in as many films, but irresistible in the part). Famke Janssen has a tough role as the reimagined Phoenix, but, again, any problems with her most be accorded to the writers.In sum, I think the X-franchise is in good standing. If nothing else, the stage is ripe for spin-offs focussing on Wolverine, a younger Magneto, and the younger X-Men like Shadowcat and Iceman. It's not as good as X2, but a commendable effort nonetheless.",8,0,1,19 June 2006
Across the Universe," Apparently filmed using a kaleidoscope...
","Julie Taymor's new movie has been getting somewhat middling reviews (on the high end, the all-father of critics, Roger Ebert, gave it four stars and said it was the only movie at the Festival that he saw twice), and I can see both sides of the coin, although I ended up enjoying it quite a bit.The film is a musical set in the 1960s, following various characters through the various signature features of the era (student activism/militancy, anti-war protests, the civil rights movement, the draft/Vietnam, the sexual revolution, drug culture), all set to over thirty Beatles songs. Pretty much all the characters are named after characters in said songs: Jude, Lucy, Max, Prudence, Sadie, etc. Jude (Jim Sturgess) is a Liverpool dockworker who decides to go to America sort of on a whim, and ends up meeting Max (Joe Anderson), and then Max's family, including his sister Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood). Jude falls in love with Lucy ('She's got a boyfriend.' 'That's alright. I've got a girlfriend.'), and eventually everyone ends up living in New York, in a single apartment populated by a bunch of other characters, including an Asian lesbian runaway named Prudence and two singers modeled on Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix. The plot isn't particularly important (one of the main criticisms of the film in reviews). The movie is all about the songs.On the subject of the music, a lot of the really big Beatles tunes are absent here, and even having a character named after one doesn't necessarily mean it gets in (Maxwell does wield a hammer at one point, but the song itself is absent). I had never heard of a lot of them (my knowledge of the Beatles isn't particularly deep). Everybody can sing quite well, and Sturgess and Wood have good romantic chemistry. Since this is a Taymor film, the visuals tend towards the quite extravagant, often going to full-blown music video rather than musical in the traditional sense ('Strawberry Fields Forever' particularly). One thing that I really liked was that Across the Universe is quite unequivocally a musical where people burst into song; one of the problems I had with Dreamgirls was that for a long time it was ambiguous about whether or not the characters were just singing the songs on stage or were actually in a musical, so that it was jarring when the film started to have characters singing conversationally.And this movie has Bono show up as a hippie guru singing 'I Am The Walrus', which sequence appears to have been filmed using a kaleidoscope; and not one, not two, but five Salma Hayeks as sexy nurses at a VA hospital.",8,0,2,21 October 2007
The Incredibles," Pixar continues to outdo itself; 'The Incredibles 2' can't come soon enough.
","Every few years, the good people at Pixar Animation Studios see fit to bless us with a new masterpiece; thus has it been since they first revolutionized the world of animation with 'Toy Story', one of the films that defined my childhood. For my money, 'Toy Story II' was the best Pixar film; up until I saw 'The Incredibles', that is. Now I'm not sure. After a second viewing, perhaps, things will be more clear. What is clear is that this is a remarkable film, one of the year's best. 'Shrek 2' isn't fit to kiss it's boot. Pixar has always cast actors, rather than stars, in their films, and their outstanding casting work continues here; the only person who sticks out is Samuel L. Jackson, but he's just so cool that it doesn't matter. Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter are superb performers, and everyone contributing does a great job (including the director, Brad Bird). The film deals with some quite mature subject matter for a children's' film, including marital difficulties, midlife crises, and the hardships of normal life. The action in this film is a leap beyond anything that has ever been animated before, and puts most action movies to shame. I look forward to Brad Bird's next project, which I'm praying will be a sequel.",10,0,1,7 November 2004
Gran Torino," Clint Eastwood: herald of multiculturalism?
","Clint Eastwood returns to the screen with his second film of 2008 as a director (and his first acting role since 'Million Dollar Baby' in 2004), following the Angelina Jolie vehicle 'Changeling', and the result is one of the more interesting features in his filmography. Though the role of Walt Kowalski was apparently not written with Eastwood specifically in mind, it is almost impossible to think otherwise, as so much in the film depends upon the screen persona that Eastwood has painstakingly constructed in the minds of audiences over his several decades of screen stardom (drawing, in particular, upon the four films he did as Detective 'Dirty' Harry Callahan, the iconic vigilante cop). The marketing suggests that this is just another such vigilante story, pitting the now 78-year-old Eastwood against another gang of ethnic toughs for the safety of his neighbours (which probably set stereotype alarms off in many a viewer). However, what the trailer suggests is not much like what the film delivers.Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a just-widowed retired Ford employee and Korean War veteran living in Highland Park, Michigan. The film opens with his wife's funeral, where he scowls at just about everyone: his two sons, their wives, and their children, especially the eldest granddaughter; and he insults the earnest but inexperienced young priest (Christopher Carney) who, at Walt's dead wife's urging, has committed himself to making Walt go to confession, which the old man has no intention of doing. Walt is just about the last white person living in his old neighbourhood, otherwise populated now by Hmong immigrants. Walt is racist almost to the point of caricature (the film takes refuge in audacity; he's so virulent in his insults that it becomes a genuinely uproarious point of humour with the audience), but he's generally misanthropic, and would rather just be left alone with his dog, Daisy, and his beloved car, the titular 1972 Gran Torino. It is the car, however, that leads to him being dragged into the lives of his neighbours, the Lor family. Thao (Bee Vang) is a fatherless young man without direction in life, who, over the objections of his sister Sue (Ahney Her), finds himself drawn towards his cousin's gang. The price of initiation is the theft of Walt's Gran Torino, which he fails at; the gang attempts to drag him away, but Walt, not knowing Thao was his attempted carjacker, intervenes ('Get off my lawn.'), and inadvertently becomes a hero to the neighbourhood, to his annoyance.Resocializing Walt becomes the project of Sue, the independent-minded and Americanized daughter, who is heedless of Walt's constant insults (firing some of her own back at him, which seems to earn her his respect). In particular, Sue hopes that her brother can find a male role model and some idea of what he wants to do in life. Meanwhile, the gang lurks on the periphery.This sounds like an extremely cliché and sentimental story of a white guy learning a Valuable Lesson about race, mixed with a standard Clint Eastwood vigilante drama about taking the fight to the local punks, but it is neither. On the former score, Eastwood's style of storytelling (and his presence in the story itself) is relentless in avoiding sentimentality; there is a strongly realistic feeling to the proceedings. There is, however, an unexpectedly high quotient of humour; the middle section of the film is frequently hilarious, making a strong case for Eastwood as the ultimate straight man in a buddy comedy (though he is also the source of most of the humour, a mix of 'fish out of water' and audacious 'I can't believe they went there' use of racial slurs). On the second count, the story Eastwood is telling here is actually a thorough deconstruction of the 'Dirty Harry' persona that he has cultivated over the years, similar to his 'Unforgiven' as a take on his old Western roles. Much of Walt's mentoring of Thao concerns views of masculinity, and the ultimate result is something audiences probably won't expect. This story wasn't expressly written with Eastwood in mind, but it's hard to imagine anyone else essaying the part, which ends up drawing so much from audience recognition of Eastwood's own history. One would never have imagined Clint Eastwood as a herald of a new, multicultural America, but that is the image this film presents us with, as the Hmong are the new defenders of traditional American family values, while Walt's family are incredibly shallow (a minor knock against the film, I think; they're so cartoonishly unworthy as to not be very believable), and there's an hysterical attack on the only other young white character as a weak imitator of blacks (or, more specifically, urban gangster/thug culture) (which the blacks don't take kindly to either; African-Americans and Latinos are tangential here, with gangs of each appearing briefly, but the focus is mainly on whites and Asians).On the acting front, Eastwood turns in another award-worthy performance; whether or not he gets an Oscar nomination, I would count him deserving of one. Eastwood also, per another recent trend, helps score the film, and actually warbles a few bars of the theme song, 'Gran Torino', which must be heard to be believed. The primary debate among reviewers of this film seems to be about whether the first-time Hmong actors that Eastwood has cast are great, awful, or something in between. Of the two main Hmong actors, Ahney Her as Sue I found to be extremely compelling; Sue is, after Walt, the film's best-realized character, and one minor issue I had with the film is how she sort of fades from view as the focus shifts to Thao. Vang as Thao is less polished than Sue, and some scenes stretch the limits of his range, but it is a credible debut.All in all, this is one of the year's best films, and I would highly recommend it.",10,0,4,21 January 2009
Hero," Visually ravishing; philosophically suspect.
","After two years of delay, the Chinese martial arts masterpiece 'Hero' arrives in Western theaters, and audiences look for the same dazzling swordplay that made 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' such a success (for the record, though, I wasn't a big fan of that movie). While the plot isn't particularly original, or important, it involves the arrival of Nameless (Jet Li) at the court of the King of Qin [Shi Huangdi, although his name is never explicitly stated on screen](Daoming Chen). Nameless has killed Long Sky (Donnie Yen), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung), and Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu Wai), three assassins who have vowed to kill the King to prevent his wars aimed at conquering all of China. Nameless recounts his story of how he defeated Long Sky, and then strategically set Flying Snow and Broken Sword against each other; also involved is Broken Sword's apprentice, Moon (Ziyi Zhang, from 'Crouching Tiger'). The King of Qin, however, believes that Nameless and the three assassins are in fact engaging in an elaborate deception to kill him. The film borrows from Akira Kurosawa's 'Rashomon' (or, really, any of the movies that have already borrowed from 'Rashomon'), in that we see multiple accounts of what supposedly has (Nameless's account, the King's version, and what really happened), each one using a different colour scheme (Nameless's story is primarily red, the King's version is blue, and the real story is white; green is used in the present, as well as in a few other flashbacks). The fight scenes are superbly staged, balletic even; my personal favourite was the fight between Nameless and Broken Sword over the lake, with the two combatants skimming across the water. The scale of the film is awesome, with director Zhang Yimou showing us massive armies arrayed in the desert and at the Court of Qin, and thousands of arrows flying through the air, obscuring the sun. Acting is good, with Maggie Cheung being the best, but there are no performances that will win Oscars; martial arts movies aren't built on acting in the traditional sense. The only troubling thing about 'Hero' is the underlying philosophy that the film seems to promote. Nameless comes to believe (as Broken Sword already did) that the King of Qin's bloody wars and tyrannical rule are justified in that they will unify China, and Nameless allows himself to be killed rather than kill the tyrant. I find that entire philosophy suspect. In the end, though, 'Hero''s philosophy scarcely matters in the long run. It's a visual film, and a great one. I give it 10/10.",10,10,16,11 September 2004
Million Dollar Baby," Clint knocks out the audience with a devastating sucker-punch.
","That Clint Eastwood continues to prosper in Hollywood, despite having been a star for four decades, reflects well upon his talent and his ability to make relevant films. 'Million Dollar Baby' is Clint's 25th directorial outing, and the 57th film he's acted in. 'Million Dollar Baby' is advertised as a female 'Rocky', with more focus on the boxing trainer. For the first two acts, perhaps, it is. The film follows Frankie Dunn (Clint), who is pursued by aspiring boxer Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank, in an Oscar-worthy portrayal). Frankie doesn't want to train girls, but Maggie is persistent, and Frankie eventually agrees. Frankie and his gym manager, Eddie 'Scrap Iron' Dupris (Morgan Freeman), train Maggie, who quickly rises through the boxing ranks. Maggie becomes a surrogate daughter to Frankie, who has a painful past with his own daughter. It's at the start of the third act that Clint sucker punches the audience, taking the film in a totally unexpected direction. After an accident in the ring, 'Million Dollar Baby' switches from a female 'Rocky' to a female 'The Sea Inside'. Let's hope for Oscars for Swank and Freeman, and, while I love 'The Aviator', Picture, Director, and even Actor are hardly undeserved. 10/10.",10,6,11,1 February 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," A sedate, interesting look at an important juncture in recent history.
","2005 has been a blockbuster year for George Clooney, who won heady praise for his actor/writer/director/producer role on 'Good Night, and Good Luck,' and for his performance as CIA Agent Bob Barnes in 'Syriana.' Clooney, son of a local journalist, seems to have great affection for this period, when television news was in its infancy. He's meticulous in depicting the way a 50s TV station was run, and it's engaging just to see the old equipment (film instead of tapes, for example). The entire place seems quite claustrophobic (the limited array of sets surely plays a part in this), and with untold toxic tobacco particles floating in the air (little wonder that Murrow died of lung cancer in early middle age).The film is quite sedate, as I said earlier, with little score (beyond some jazz riffs that can get a bit repetitive), and tight camera-work that focuses solely on the actors, walking down grey halls and talking in offices and meeting rooms. The film's trailer really misrepresents the kind of film this is; it's a docu-drama, that does not 'sex up' the day-to-day workings of a newsroom. Anyone not really interested in the subject matter is likely to be bored by the movie.There is a bevy of quality actors in the film, ranging from Clooney himself (underplaying nicely), David Straitharn as the legendary Murrow, Frank Langella, Tate Donovan, Jeff Daniels, Patricia Clarkson, and Robert Downey Jr. There's very little character in the film; Clooney is interested in the genesis of the plot, and the facts. It makes for refreshingly unsensationalized viewing, although it can seem a bit sterile.It's interesting to note the differences between this and Clooney's other political film; GNaGD argued that good men, like Edward R. Murrow, could topple villains like McCarthy if they stuck to their principles; 'Syriana''s ultimate message is that we're probably screwed, regardless of what we try to do, because the problems of the world are beyond anyone's ability to solve. This film's message is, obviously, the one most people would prefer.",9,2,4,30 January 2006
The Dark Knight," The Dark Knight delivers the film fans have been waiting for.
","In 2005, Christopher Nolan relaunched Warner Brothers' dormant Batman franchise with 'Batman Begins', an exceptionally well-made film that took a realistic, detailed approach to the origins of DC's biggest hero (arguably the most popular hero in the world). Now, three years later, Nolan and his star Christian Bale return to the property, and they deliver what is perhaps the greatest superhero film ever made (and a great film, besides), one that will become the model all others will look up to.The first movie ended on an optimistic note: Batman had saved the city, and had 'really started something', in Gordon's words: however, one tease at the end (the Joker's playing card) hinted at the violent chaos to come in the next movie. And here, Nolan delivers on that, in the form of the late Heath Ledger, in a performance that is already becoming legendary. Gordon closed the last film with a prediction that Batman's presence would lead to escalation in the criminal community. He was right. The desperate Gotham mafia (a coalition of Slavic, African-American, and Italian gangsters) turn to the Joker to deal with Batman before he brings them all down. The Joker enacts a campaign of terror designed to smoke Batman out: the caped crusader and his chief allies, DA Harvey Dent and Police Commissioner Gordon (the first film's Commissioner Loeb is among the Joker's first victims), along with assistants Alfred Pennyworth and Lucius Fox, must deal with this embodiment of chaos. Dent, as well, is romancing Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, a superior replacement for Katie Holmes).Nolan and his screenwriters draw on several different comics sources to create their vision of Batman, the Joker, and Gotham. The most obvious among these are Alan Moore's 'The Killing Joke' (perhaps the seminal Batman vs. Joker story) and Jeph Loeb's 'Batman: The Long Halloween', which involved Harvey Dent and the struggle between Batman and the mob. Moore's Joker was conceived of as having no fixed origin, and Nolan follows throuhg with this: the Joker has no origin, though he offers several different versions to different people.Conversely, the film diverges noticeably from the comics in its depiction of Two-Face. There is no split personality in evidence, nor any of the psychological problems that said personality springs from. Two-Face has more or less been cut down to his gimmick, and then a new rationale for the gimmick constructed to suit the themes of the film. Eckhart is very compelling as this version, which also sports some effectively grisly makeup/effects.'Batman Begins' was notable for being the first Batman film to really be about Batman, instead of being a showcase for various freakshow villains; this is dialled back a bit in this film, where the villains take more of a centre-stage. Batman still has a significant character arc, but the story is less about him; notice that the buzz surrounding the movie centres on Ledger, not Bale. That Batman is less of a focus is not a bad thing in and of itself, so long as the villains are well-done, which they are. Caine, Freeman, Oldman, and Gyllenhaal are all effective supporting cast.One of the most notable things about this film is its ability to make the audience doubt the outcome, bringing the storytelling styles that have flourished in the comics industry for at least twenty years to the big screen at last; Spider-Man succeeded in 2002 where he failed in the comics in 1973, but now the audience is never sure whether Batman's allies will reliably make it out alive. It's a jolt that one hopes will allow future comics adaptations to reach the greater diversity of outcomes that the comics currently enjoy.A bravura effort from all involved.",10,7,16,16 August 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Fantastic.
","Top marks; an excellent film. I'm not sure if I prefer this or Prisoner of Azkaban, but the films are neck-and-neck.One of the things I find about watching any of these films is that, as a die-hard fan of the texts, I find it difficult to escape critiquing the film as adaptation as a watch it; I know how the scenes play out in the books, who gets the cool lines, and how plots intersect, and so I observe how the filmmakers rework it on film; this was true to an extent in this film (moments like when Sirius, rather than Moody, gives Harry the photo of the old Order; or Kingsley getting Phineas' 'style' line), but, as I was on my way home, I realized that I had completely overlooked the way the filmmakers rerouted the villains' scheme in the end, jettisoning Kreacher's involvement entirely. So, they can pull me out of the canon on occasion, and that's pretty impressive.Also, the repeat of the 'I must not tell lie' line (which I guessed two seconds before he said it) was an excellent addition.The only things I really miss here were the encounter with Neville's parents at the hospital (the scene between Harry and Neville in the RoR is a decent substitute) and all the Umbridge v. McGonagall stuff (we get a truncated version, but I really wanted the career consultations scene; Maggie Smith would have been awesome in that).The action the Department of Mysteries was excellent; in particular, the arrival of the Order of the Phoenix as clouds of white smoke was a real 'yeah, the cavalry' moment, and the choreography of the initial encounter between Harry's team and the Death Eaters was brilliantly claustrophobic. By comparison, the Dumbledore vs. Voldemort fight was kind of anti-climactic (in an interesting choice, Voldemort seems to really overpower Dumbledore here, while in the book it's more of a clear stalemate).There were the usual clutch of stellar performances from the entire British theatre guild. It's become perfunctory to say that Alan Rickman absolutely rules all, but he still does. The kids are all terrific here, and there's actually some effort made to set Ron and Hermione up (although Radcliffe and Watson still have more chemistry on film). The girl playing Luna is really, really good. On the villain side, Jason Isaacs delivers another of his 'smooth criminal' performances, and Lucius remains the series' best villain; at the same time, Ralph Fiennes' Lord Voldemort is way, way better here than he was in GoF (where I was a bit underwhelmed); Helena Bonham Carter has few lines, but she's effectively creepy/deranged. And Imelda Staunton is great as Umbridge (as I knew she would be as soon as I saw Vera Drake).Yates' direction is great (very much like Cuaron's), and he and the screenwriter make some inspired stylistic choices (they get a lot of mileage out of the things the Room of Requirement will do to suit the needs of the people inside). I also want to mention the way that Ron and co. escape the Inquisitorial Squad, which I have to say I like much better than the method in the book.",10,0,1,4 September 2007
Pride & Prejudice," An old-fashioned piece of film-making.
","First off, unlike so many posters and reviewers, I have not read Jane Austen's 'Pride & Prejudice', nor have I seen the storied BBC miniseries starring Colin Firth, who apparently was to-die-for in a wet shirt. I approached this film knowing very little about the story or characters, beyond the most important plot points, and the fact that critics generally liked it. I liked it too; it was very enjoyable. The film has an absolutely terrific cast, including Academy Award-winning screen veterans Dame Judi Dench and Brenda Blethyn, and should-be Academy Award-winning Donald Sutherland; the young cast is led by Keira Knightley, Rosamund Pike (the allegedly more-attractive older sister), and Matthew MacFayden. All are terrific, although, as a man, the constant giggling of the Bennett sisters was occasionally too much. The film is gorgeously shot, and should earn Oscar nominations for set design, cinematography, and perhaps an acting nomination or two (Knightley is first in line, with Sutherland (whose part may be too small), Blethyn, and Pike not far behind). I give this film a strong recommendation, and a 9/10.",9,2,3,27 November 2005
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Another terrific entry in a great film series.
","I'm a die-hard fan of J.K. Rowling's magical 'Harry Potter' series, and I have enjoyed each of the four Hollywood films that have been based on her novels, to varying degrees. Chris Columbus' two films were good, but it was Alfonso Cuaron who elevated the series to artistry, and Mike Newell follows Cuaron's lead.Cuaron's poetic style and intimate camera is gone, replaced with 'Star Wars: Episode III' epic sweep. Everything in this film is big, loud, and energetic, reflecting the many changes sweeping through Harry's world, and the cataclysmic struggle that all informed viewers know lies ahead. The Triwizard Tournament is the centrepiece of the film, consisting largely of the three tasks, with the Yule Ball wedged in between; all leading up to the Little Hangleton graveyard, perhaps the single greatest scene in all Rowling's canon.As the series evolves, it's young stars continue to thrive. Understated and effective Daniel Radcliffe, bumbling everyman Rupert Grint, and energetic, mannered Emma Watson have all become their characters, and it would be a tragedy were any of them to miscarry before this series ends. They're backed up, per usual, by the whole British Screen Actors Guild, doing the damnedest to steal their individual scenes. Michael Gambon is a powerful Dumbledore, Dame Maggie Smith an intelligent McGonagall, and Alan Rickman a suave Snape; newcomers like Brendan Gleeson do great work, although the presence of David Thewlis' Lupin is missed.To all involved, our thanks.",10,0,0,27 November 2005
The Untouchables," A fine film, although Costner can't surpass Robert Stack.
","The 1960s television show 'The Untouchables', starring Robert Stack as Eliot Ness, is one of the finest crime dramas ever produced. Th 1987 film, with Kevin Costner as Eliot Ness, is also of high quality, although I prefer the TV series in general; if only for the higher volume of material. The film is set in Chicago during Al Capone's reign, when all levels of the government and police have been infiltrated by the mafia. Treasury agent Eliot Ness (Costner) and his squad of Untouchables have vowed to bring down Capone and his organization. The other members of the squad are; James Malone (Sean Connery), an old Irish (?!) cop; George Stone (Andy Garcia), an Italian recruit; and Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), an accountant from the Treasury Department. Capone is played by Robert De Niro, in another of his iconic mob roles. There are several classic sequences in the film: the harrowing death of the little girl; Capone's baseball lecture; the ambush at the Canadian border; the death of Malone; the shootout at the train station; and Ness's climactic killing of Frank Nitti. The plot is not airtight, but it hardly matters. This is a classic piece of entertainment.",9,1,2,27 December 2004
The Fountain," My interpretation of events...
","From the first time I heard of it, I was very interested by the concept of Darren Aronofsky's 'The Fountain,' starring Aronofsky's wife Rachel Weicz and Hugh Jackman. It has been receiving an extraordinarily mixed reaction from critics and audiences, and there seems to be very little middle ground. It is, truth be told, a bit pretentious, and (if my interpretation is correct) it's not saying anything new (it's the same basic idea as the moral of 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'), but it's quite an impressive work of art. It is an interesting, poetic film, with a great performance from Hugh Jackman (Rachel Weicz's role is less substantial, as only in the 2000 segment is she given a real part, but she is also good).Without having looked at any of the other theories that have been posted, this is my interpretation: the anchor story is the 2000 segment (although there's no specific dates given, other than in the trailer), about the quest for medical immortality. Thomas is looking for the medical 'fountain of youth/life', while Izzie has found a kind of acceptance about death and the universe. The 1500 segment is her allegorical story about her life, with the last chapter left open for Thomas to write. In the 2000 segment, Thomas finds the medical fountain, but too late, and so he lives into the 2500 segment, traveling with the Mayan spirit-tree thing to the nebula. The tree dies, just as Izzie died right before the cure was found, and so he realizes the truth about death and the afterlife. The final section of the 1500 segment, which we see intercut with the finale in 2500, is Thomas' realization of how the last chapter of Izzie's book should be written.My assumption through most of the film was that Tomas found the Tree of Life and he and Queen Isabella lived into the 2000 segment, at which point she became ill, since the Tree doesn't grant invulnerability; obviously, I changed this perception when Tomas turned into a flower bush.The other interesting thing I noted was that the Grand Inquisitor's spiel about death was more or less correct; the characterization of the body as a 'prison' doesn't really fit, but the idea of death freeing all souls is right.I give it a 10 out of 10 as a work of art; it should be seen by people, even if many will not like it.",10,0,1,28 January 2007
It's a Wonderful Life," Truly wonderful.
","I was in elementary school when I first saw 'It's A Wonderful Life'.  My teacher (or perhaps a substitute) had little to do in the last day before the holidays began, and so she decided that the class would spend the entire morning watching 'It's A Wonderful Life'.  I had, of course, heard of the film, and seen several parodies and takes on its ending (on Tiny Toon Adventures, for example), but I had never seen the film itself.  Seeing that movie was a life-changing experience.  Simply put, 'It's A Wonderful Life' is one of the greatest movies ever made, and one of the few black and white films that can hold my attention. Jimmy Stewart gives the performance of his life as George Bailey, the humble man from Bedford Falls who sets aside his life's ambitions in order to help others.  Stewart is truly phenomenal, even if the spectacle of him playing the 'young' George is a bit difficult to accept.  Also in fine form is Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Potter, the nastiest and richest man in town.  Mr. Potter is the very embodiment of the self-satisfied aristocrat, and an easy man to hate.  Donna Reed is great as George's true love, Mary, although (like Stewart) her unchanged appearance despite the passage of many years requires some creative disbelief.  Particularly heartbreaking is Thomas Mitchell as Uncle Billy, the good-natured but forgetful man who nearly ruins the family. The plot of 'It's A Wonderful Life' is well known, and has been frequently imitated, but never surpassed.  George Bailey decides to end his life, and God sends an angel to help him.  George then becomes convinced that the world would have been better off he had never been born, so the angel Clarence transports him into an alternate timeline where he did not exist, and shows him how George's selfless life altered so many people's lives for the better.  George returns, and is greeted with the results of his compassion. I watch 'It's A Wonderful Life' once a year, when it aires at Christmastime, and it always brings me a great feel of renewal.  This is a true classic, one that all people should watch, regardless of their faith.  10/10, and a cheer for all those involved.",10,1,5,19 August 2004
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Brad and Angelina make an enchanting (off?)screen couple
","Most of the early publicity surrounding 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' had to do with the alleged relationship between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, which supposedly led to the demise of Pitt's relationship with Jennifer Aniston. Regardless, this doesn't affect the film that much; whether or not they are soon to be Mr. and Mrs. Pitt, Mr. and Mrs. Smith are both engaging, fun characters, and the movie can be similarly described.The setup is well-known; John (Pitt) and Jane (Jolie) are a bored married couple each unaware that the other is a highly-trained assassin, and that they work for different, rival companies. When they eventually do figure this out, they are ordered to eliminate each other. The plot of the film could cheerfully be called minimalist; it's mostly about the darkly comedic interaction between John and Jane, and some brutally fun fight scenes. When the Smiths demolish their house, reminiscent of a famous 'Alias' fight, laughs come fast and furious. The whole film really resembles, more than anything else, a 1930s screwball comedy, except with lots of guns.Neither Jolie or Pitt has a particularly difficult role; they're both required to seem cool and sexy, which they are capable of doing in their sleep. But they both do it well, and the result is undeniably entertaining. I give 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' an 8/10.",8,0,1,2 July 2005
War of the Worlds," Spielberg shows he's still got it.
","Steven Spielberg, the greatest film director currently working, re-teams with Tom Cruise, Hollywood's top gun, to adapt H.G. Wells' classic novel 'War of the Worlds'. Wells set his story at the turn of the 20th century, in the heyday of the British Empire, and modeled his story as a critique of British imperialism. In the world post-9/11, Spielberg and Cruise transfer their story to 21st century New Jersey.Cruise plays Ray Ferrier, a blue-collar dock worker who is divorced from his wife (LOTR's Miranda Otto), and is a rather poor father to his two children, Rachel (Dakota Fanning) and Robbie (Justin Chatwin). The arrival of the alien tripod machines disrupts everything, and suddenly the three of them are running for their lives.Spielberg movies are usually known for their kindness and amiability, but this film is brutal. The terrifying alien tripods incinerate humans by the hundreds, and mount a particularly graphic attack on a ferry boat (standing in for Wells' HMS Thunderchild). These aliens will never be mistaken for the jokey ET or the benevolent spacemen of 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'. 'War of the Worlds' is one long chase scene, and Spielberg's range as a director is demonstrated clearly. I can't wait to see what he does with his film about the Israeli Mossad. I give WotW a 9/10.",9,3,7,2 July 2005
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," An enjoyable diversion.
","There are any number of reasons why 'Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist' will be frequently compared to 2007's indie hit 'Juno', chief among them the presence of Michael Cera, the male lead in that film, again opposite a peppy brunette who isn't quite sure what she wants in life (neither is he, for that matter). While not in the same league as 'Juno' in terms of character or story (though possessed of a far less annoying soundtrack), it is worthwhile for anyone looking for an entertaining film about teens.The titular Nick is the depressed guitarist for a queercore band (meaning, all the other members are gay), and thoroughly depressed over being dumped by his girlfriend Tris (Alexis Dzienza); at the urging of his bandmates, he goes to their latest gig, largely because he has learned that his favourite band ('Where's Fluffy?') will be playing at an undisclosed location (which seems counterproductive to selling, to me, but what do I know about hipster music?). Norah, meanwhile, is a nominal friend of Tris' who has never met Nick, but knows of him through the CDs he is continually making and sending to Tris ('Road to Closure, volume 12' the most recent example), which she picks up after Tris discards them. A chance encounter leads to them meeting cute and pretending to be together, sparking a multiplicity of sideplots involving a jealous Tris, Norah's drunk friend Caroline (Ari Gaynor, who deserves some kind of prize for playing one of the least appealing drunks in recent memory), and, of course, the question of 'Fluffy'.This is the sort of production that (like 'Before Sunrise') hinges on the main actors' performances and chemistry, and Michael Cera and Kat Dennings succeed wonderfully in that regard. Cera, as most reviewers have noted, is basically playing the same character that he played in 'Juno', 'Arrest Development', and 'Superbad'; it's a popular persona, one that he has honed to smile-inducing precision, and, in his defence, he is nowhere near the first actor to develop a schtick (indeed, most of the greats refined a persona and either played to or against type). Cera might try something different in the near future just to give a better idea of his rang (serial killer!), but I won't hold that against him. Kat Dennings, meanwhile, strikes a very individual note; Norah is extremely well-characterized. Dennings does a good job of showing her uncertainties and conveying her frustrated attitudes towards the still-hung-up Nick. The rest of the cast does a good job in small parts. The crew makes the New York nightlife look tremendously appealing.Recommended as a light entertainment.",7,0,0,24 March 2009
Wedding Crashers," Worth seeing just for the lovely Rachel McAdams.
","Cahadian actress Rachel McAdams ('Mean Girls') is both beautiful and talented, and her star appears to be in ascendancy. That's a good thing for everyone. She is a wonderful screen presence, and 'Wedding Crashers' is worth seeing solely because of her.This is clearly a 'Frat Pack' movie, with Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn in the lead roles, and Will Ferrell making a cameo appearance. I kind of wish that Owen's brother Luke had shown up, but that's neither here nor there. Owen and Vince are thirtysomethings who crash weddings in order to seduce bridesmaids. They decide to crash the wedding of the eldest daughter of William Cleary (Christopher Walken), a powerful politician. In doing so, Owen falls for Claire (McAdams) and Vince is snared by Gloria (Isla Fisher), a borderline-psychotic nymphomaniac. Vince wants to run, but Owen is now in love with Claire, and wants to convince her to leave her lout of a boyfriend, Sack (Bradley Cooper, intense and losable). Various hilarious and embarrassing antics ensue.Unusually for movies of this genre, both Claire and Gloria feel like real characters. Owen is sometimes a bit boring, while Vince is playing his standard character, and doing it well. Will Ferrell's cameo is as the original Wedding Crasher, who has now gone on to crashing funerals. It's all good.I give 'Wedding Crashers' an 8/10.",8,3,6,26 July 2005
There Will Be Blood," A worthy period piece from Anderson.
","Director Paul Thomas Anderson does another period piece, skipping further back in time then he did with his famous 1997 work 'Boogie Nights'. This time, the destination is the United States in the early years of the 20th century, with a brief epilogue set some time after the Wall Street crash of 1929. The subject is the California oil industry, based (very, very loosely) on Upton Sinclair's famous book 'Oil!'. The character is Daniel Plainview, played by Daniel Day-Lewis in his second Oscar-winning role.The story follows Plainview as he pursues his dream of earning enough money to separate himself forever from other people, who he despises as a general rule. He has a son, H.W., who he actually does care for, though at the same time he loves money; one is reminded of one analysis of Shylock that said that the most charitable thing to be said about his attitudes was that if he didn't put his daughter before his ducats, at least the reverse wasn't true. Plainview is given a hot tip by Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) about huge amounts of oil in his home town, and hurries to buy up all the neighbouring areas. The major other character is Eli Sunday (also Dano), a would-be evangelical preacher and miracle-worker. If Plainview is brutal capitalism, Sunday is fundamentalist religion (recalling the huckster faith-healers of later decades). As business grows, the conflict between the two grows based on minor acts of spite and conflicting worldviews.The character of Plainview is the movie, basically. As played by Day-Lewis, in a volcanic performance, he is a mass of contradictions and impulses: he genuinely cares for his son, but at the same time he is driven by greed for money. When his son becomes deafened in an accident, Plainview first cannot stay beside him because of the accident, and later, struggling to deal with it, sends him away to the city. In what I think Plainview regards as Sunday's most offensive act, he forces him to face up to this action and show genuine weakness and desperation to escape the possible wrath of God. Plainview later reenacts this scene at the climax, with the roles reversed, to remarkable effect. Occasionally, he explodes into violence, particularly when family is brought up; as he relates to one character who later falls victim to this violence, he doesn't like people, and at times he seems like he does want to reach out. Ultimately, though, he is a cynical, vengeful, black-hearted old man that Ebenezer Scrooge would be appalled by.Anderson and his crew meticulously reconstruct the time period, conveying the many dangers faced by the pioneer workers in the early oil industry. More than one many dies a grisly death as a result, and blows sting the audience as sharply as the bolts from Anton Chigurh's airgun.On another note, this is often called an adaptation of Sinclair's 'Oil!', but it is not, really. Anderson takes one or two ideas from the novel, perhaps, but among other things, the names are all changed (Plainview and Sunday have been given Meaningful Names in lieu of the more ordinary Ross and Watkins), an the plot is different, focussing on the father character. Most significantly, the moral of the story is completely reversed: the tycoon in Sinclair's novel is a genuinely likable figure who is corrupt and brutal because the system is corrupt and brutal. Anderson remakes this to the story of a sociopath who is rotten because of his own nature, with the system itself apart from him seen much more benignly. There are mentions made of monopolies held by men like John D. Rockefeller, but all the other characters seem reasonable and cower in fear of Plainview. Not that it isn't a good movie, but it seems a strange adaptation that completely changes the meaning of one of the great social commentators of the 20th century.All in all, I quite quite liked this movie; as a film, I felt it was much more wholistic than the Coens' 'No Country For Old Men' (though my personal vote for the Oscar would have been 'Atonement').",10,1,3,16 August 2008
The Reader," Well, Winslet's plan to win an Oscar by starring in a Holocaust film worked.
","Stephen Daldry is a director who has started to acquire a reputation for tackling books that are rather difficult to adapt, starting with his 2002 debut, 'The Hours'. This time, he has chosen as his subject Bernhard Schlink's 1995 novel 'Der Vorleser', which was somewhat controversial at the time, attracting accusations of creating too much reader sympathy for a former SS officer. I did not find that to be the case here; what Schlink and Daldry are doing, as I see it, is raising uncomfortable questions and taking the stance that there are no neat answers (which could, I suppose, be called a dodge, or else dramatically unsatisfying).The film, like 'The Hours', has a somewhat intricate narrative structure, juggling timelines in 1958, 1966, spans from the 1970s to the 1980s, and 1995. There are points when this seems unnecessarily complicated, but it generally works well. The most effective sequences are the 1958-1966 span, where Michael Berg (David Kross) finds himself drawn into an affair with Hanna Schmidt (Kate Winslet), a Neustadt tram employee. He is 15, she considerably older. Their relationship is almost a quid pro quo of sex and reading. Then, one day, she vanishes, only to return into his life surprisingly in 1966, when he finds her on trial for her role in the death of 300 Jewish women in the final days of World War II. In the later sequences, an adult Michael (Ralph Fiennes, a long way from Amon Goethe) as he deals with the aftermath of these events.One of the more prurient items of discussion regarding this film is that it features quite a bit of Kate Winslet naked and having sex (though 1 in every 2 Kate Winslet movies might be said to have the same). There is also plenty from the young Kross (one imagines your average young actor would be thrilled for their first role to involve a lot of time being naked in bed with Kate Winslet). There is in our society something of a double-standard regarding such underage relationships; if this film starred Brad Pitt and Emma Watson, once imagines the reaction of critics and audiences would be rather different. However, 'The Reader' conveys with great subtlety the damage this does to Michael (even before the Nazi revelation). In 1958, while the affair goes on, Michael becomes isolated from his friends and ignores the more age-appropriate Sophie; by 1966, at law school, he finds himself incapable of sleeping in the same bed as a fellow law student; in the present day, we find him divorced and struggling to connect with his daughter.On the issue of the Holocaust, the filmmakers are quite aware of the risk they run in focussing so much on Hanna; the camera tends to create sympathy, particularly as she is so scared an uncomprehending when brought to trial. We feel the temptation to make excuses for her based on illiteracy. And, at the end, the film wheels out a survivor (Lena Olin, wonderful in two scenes) to challenge this directly. Michael, whose story this is and whose views have been transplanted to the audience to an extent, squirms under her questions. As Olin says, the film cannot offer absolution, nor, perhaps, should it (that's up to you, of course).Berg's guilt comes not just from his inability to resolve the question of Hanna, but also from his own actions in 1966, and what that says about him. On a much smaller scale, he repeats the moral cowardice of Hanna's generation which casts doubt on whether he'd have done any better in her situation.The cast is excellent. Winslet deserved an Oscar for the work she does here (though it's more properly a supporting role, not a lead); what she does with her facial expressions in the trial scene is impressive. Kross makes a strong impression here as well. There's novelty in the presence of actors from past Holocaust dramas occupying roles much more sympathetic; not just Spielberg's Amon Goethe, but Hitler himself, Bruno Ganz ('Downfall', another film that attracted criticism of too much sympathy for the devil), as a law professor. Overall, a very strong package.And for those who don't get the title reference, do consider watching the BBC comedy series 'Extras'.",8,1,2,9 March 2009
Sherlock Holmes," An entertaining swashbuckler that gives a great character a new lease on life.
","Sherlock Holmes has been identified by the Guinness Book of World Records as one of the most frequently used fictional characters in history. Appearing first in the 60 stories of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, he has subsequently went on to make hundreds (if not thousands) of appearances in novels, film, television, and radio, with the part essayed by a number of very talented actors, with Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett the most notable. Adventures on the big screen have been slim pickings for a while (the last really notable one was 1985's 'Young Sherlock Holmes', obviously a bit of a break with traditional formulas) as TV adaptations have been the go-to medium. This new entry aims to jumpstart a new cinema franchise and introduce Holmes as a living character to a new generation of fans (as opposed to just being a cultural touchstone), with the assistance of talents like Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. This has been met with understandable wariness by longtime fans, but I would say that overall the movie succeeds admirably at its goal. Some spoilers follow.The bare bones of the plot (summarized in innumerable places elsewhere): Holmes (Downey Jr.) and Watson (Law) crack the case of a series of ritualistic murders and arrest the man responsible, Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong; doing a lot of villain-work this year, and looking like a British crossbreed of Andy Garcia and Stanley Tucci). However, even after Blackwood is hung by the neck until dead, trouble continues, and it appears that he may indeed have risen from the grave thanks to the black magic he claimed to possess. Holmes is back on the trail of the seemingly-resurrected villain, while former acquaintance Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) reenters the picture, in the employ of an anonymous stranger. And on the domestic front, Watson is getting engaged to the nice Mary Morstan (Kelly Reilly) and preparing to move out of his Baker Street bachelor flat, much to Holmes' annoyance.I would say that this film has been somewhat poorly-represented by its trailers and promotional material (not poorly served, though, if the box office returns are any measure), which plays up the action to a point that will turn off many diehards (though one imagines they'll still see it to feel the joy of bilious outrage). While there is certainly more physicality to this production than to your average BBC adaptation, director Guy Ritchie retains the core of Holmes as a cerebral man (and, truth be told, Doyle's original knew his way around a fight, even if the author didn't spare much prose on depicting it). Tastes change a bit, and, so long as the core of the character isn't lost, it's fine by me to show him in a few scraps.Downey's Holmes is a brilliant/eccentric mind with addiction issues, and rather poor hygiene (I tend to think of him as being more precise, even when troubled, but whatever). But he's always on top of things. Saints be praised, though, for Jude Law's Watson, who will hopefully go a long way toward rescuing the character from the bumbling ghetto created by Nigel Bruce's characterization and carried on ever since. Law gives us a strong, confident Watson who is an indispensible part of Holmes' operation, and possessed of considerable deductive prowess of his own. The film really hangs on the Holmes/Watson interaction, and Downey and Law hit it off marvelously. The film opens in media res (a smart move, really; it's not like anyone is unaware of who these characters are and how they work), and you get a palpable sense of two people who've been working together for a very long time. The ladies threatening to intrude on this male-bonding exercise, McAdams and Reilly, are both fine, though the writers sometimes seem a bit insure of what to do with Irene (they know enough about the mythos to know that Holmes isn't the romantic type, even if this is a bit more in that direction than most depictions, so this is a fairly mild case of Catwoman). Mark Strong glowers and growls sufficiently as the villain.While heavier on the action than your typical Holmes story, and a lot grimier in its production design (true to life, one imagines; outside of the upper class, Victorian London wasn't the cleanest of places), Ritchie and his writers retain a lot of the core Holmes story aspects. A villain with seemingly mystical powers must be confronted, and Holmes' logical mind must inevitably pierce the veil and uncover the rational explanation behind it all (outlined in a marvelous little climactic scene). And, as we find out, Holmes has been slowly building his case through the whole movie, but rarely letting anything on. The film also does a pretty good job of making Holmes' end-of-film explanation visually interesting, rather than just a dull monologue.The film ends with some quite obvious sequel setup, and given the box office numbers, it's pretty likely we'll see a 'Sherlock Holmes 2' in a few years; I welcome it.",9,11,20,28 December 2009
WALL·E," Pixar works its magic once again.
","Over the years, Pixar has regaled us with stories involving children's' toys, ants, things that go bump in the night, fish, superheroes, and culinarily-inclined rats; so we now arrive at the next logical step: mostly-mute robots. The result is Chaplin's 'City Lights' crossed with a bevy of science fiction (notable nods are made to productions such as '2001: A Space Odyssey'), made with Pixar's now standard charm and craft. And the result may very well be Pixar's finest piece of work to date, which is no small thing in a catalogue that includes 'Toy Story 2' and 'The Incredibles'.WALL-E, a little robot, inhabits an abandoned, garbage-clogged Earth some 702 years in the future, after humanity abandoned the world as uninhabitable, leaving robots behind to clear things up. Over the centuries, most of the robots broke down, leaving only one, the title character. He has evolved a personality, and collects choice items for storage in his house, where he lives with seemingly the only other living creature, a cockroach. Then, one day, a spaceship deposits the ovoid probe droid EVE in the vicinity, and the lonely WALL-E is smitten. Eventually, he wins the all-business EVE's affection, before a turn of events forces the little robot (who looks like a mini-trash compactor with tank treads for legs and binoculars for eyes) to go on an epic adventure into outer space which I won't go into too much detail on, as this is a movie best experienced.WALL-E, EVE, and the various other robots in the movie are triumphs of design, whose deliberately inhuman appearances do not prevent them from coming across to the audience as profoundly well-realized. This is not such a revelation as some would have you believe; R2-D2 and the magic carpet from 'Aladdin' illustrated the depth possible and achieved here. WALL-E and EVE are a magical screen couple, despite dialogue that consists of each others' names, and some random guttural noises; inflection and some expressive eyes carry the day. The animation of the various human characters renders them more unreal in many respects, given what humanity has become in its 700-year absence. Pixar has been delivering the gold standard in CGI for years, and they don't stop here, even as the technology has become far more widespread (there were no less than three non-Pixar CGI films at my showing of WALL-E).This is most definitely a film with a message, but it is artfully incorporated into the main story, which is all about EVE and WALL-E. Adults will spot more clearly the finer points of the story about environmental responsibility and consumerism (the latter is, somewhat hypocritically, perhaps, packaged in what will undoubtedly be a heavily-commodified production).And, hey, you may develop a new appreciation for the film version of 'Hello, Dolly!' while watching this.",10,3,8,28 June 2008
The Good Shepherd," A slow, excellent effort by De Niro and his cast.
","After seeing almost no movies in 2006, there are a half-dozen coming out within the last two weeks that I'm interested in seeing ('Rocky Balboa' being the most surprising entry on the list). I just got back from a showing of 'The Good Shepherd', Robert De Niro's second directorial effort. He's apparently been developing this for a while, and has roped in a pretty impressive cast, even for small roles (he even managed to smoke Joe Pesci out of the self-imposed exile he's been on since the last 'Lethal Weapon' film).The film follows Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) from 1939, when he is inducted into the Skull & Bones Society at Yale, and then enlisted by General Sullivan (De Niro himself) to serve in the OSS during World War II, until 1961, in the aftermath of the Bay of Pigs fiasco. Through Wilson, we see the founding of the CIA, the Cold War with the KGB, and the disintegration of Wilson's shotgun-marriage (albeit to Angelina Jolie) under the stress. There's the typical 'honest patriot discovers how ugly things are' story, but, unlike many spy films, the film never gets into a debate about whether or not all this is really necessary; the tone is clinical, as in, this is how is happens, and this is how it affects people.Performancewise, Damon is good as the central character, but he's a pretty tightly-wound character (think Jeffrey Wright in 'Syriana'), so he's not really that emotive (this keeps things from getting excessively maudlin, although it also lends itself to criticism that the character's emotional arc isn't especially evident) (although he does dress up like a woman and play 'Buttercup' in Gilbert & Sullivan's 'HMS Pinafore'). As in a lot of movies, the supporting cast contains all the live wires: Jolie, obviously, although she's in a fairly traditional role (put-upon wife), even if her early scenes give her a lot more fire than is often the case; John Turturro, as Damon's associate/subordinate throughout his career, who is also notable as the only spy in the film who ever raises his voice that much (when beating up a would-be defector); and, in my favourite performance, Tammy Blanchard as Laura, Edward's first girlfriend, who comes to represent the life he might have had if he hadn't joined the CIA. The movie's best scene comes when Edward and Laura are on the beach, shortly before Pearl Harbour; Edward had just been seduced by Margaret (Jolie's character), in a rather bizarre scene, but still loves Laura; then, Margaret's brother arrives and Edward goes to speak with him, and is told that Margaret is pregnant; now Laura is deaf, but she's lip-read the whole conversation from a distance, and just dejectedly walks away before Edward can say anything.To be clear, this isn't a happy movie, but it's a very good one.",10,7,12,27 December 2006
The Shawshank Redemption," Quite simply the greatest film ever made.
","Frank Darabont's 'The Shawshank Redemption', starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, is the greatest film ever made in Hollywood. Plain and simple. The film tells the involving story of two prisoners at Shawshank Prison, and their decades together under the thumb of a cruel warden and his henchman. Andy (Tim Robbins, never better) is an innocent man, who uses his accounting skills to make himself useful to the warden, and struggles to keep up hope, against the counsel of his fellow inmates. Red (Morgan Freeman, astonishing) thinks hope is a dangerous thing, and is an institutionalized man, who can't imagine life outside of the prison walls. The film also stars Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown, William Sadler, and, in a powerful performance, James Whitmore. I'll say no more, because this film must be seen to be understood.",10,0,1,5 December 2004
The Queen," A compelling, low-key film for adults.
","Diana, Princess of Wales' life and death were both fodder for sensationalist tabloids and newspapers, as well as a rather unique event in the 1990s; a singular outpouring of national, even global, grief for an 'ex-HRH' who became a media princess. This film, made by the reliable director Stephen Frears, follows the British Royal family in the week between Diana's death and her funeral. Helen Mirren, essaying her third British Queen (well, two Queens and a Queen-consort), plays Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and a score or so other nations for over fifty years.I have always been an advocate for the Canadian Monarchy (a thousand dead Irish-Catholic relatives scattered along the Boyne roll over in their graves), in support of a traditional establishment that has served our country well over the years; I've always greatly admired the Queen's dedication to duty and dignified execution of her office. Mirren portrays her as a concerned, professional woman who finds that the England of her father, George VI, has changed under her feet, and she may not be able to judge the mood anymore. Tony Blair, played by Michael Sheen, attempts to transition the Crown to a more modern role, while fending off barbs from his disrespectful subordinates.There isn't a whole lot of plot here, but it is a terrific character study of the Queen and the Prime Minister. Mirren and Sheen are excellent, and each is physically a dead-ringer for their subject. Other actors, such as Sylvia Syms (the Queen Mum), James Cromwell (Prince Phillip), and Alex Jennings (Prince Charles) are not as physically similar, but are also strong in their parts; Syms is a delightful comic, and she and Cromwell get most of the best lines (there's a good deal of humour, the dry and educated variety, to be found here). Mirren's performance has been deservedly praised, but it is a shame that Sheen's work has fallen by the wayside; he deserved a nomination for Best Supporting Actor.A decades after Diana's death, the fears for the future of the monarchy have not come to pass; Elizabeth II is still widely admired, and more popular than ever, and she can hopefully surpass Queen Victoria as England's longest-serving monarch. God save the Queen.",9,1,2,28 January 2007
Iron Man," Marvel Studios scores in its first shot.
","It'll take another viewing to confirm, but we may possibly have reached Nerdvana with this movie (incidentally, we got a trailer for The Dark Knight, but it was the teaser they initially released; meh; also, there was the Incredible Hulk teaser, which people seemed to like). I got into comics through the animated adaptations of things like Spider-Man and X-Men, so I only knew of Iron Man from his appearances in the 90s Spidey cartoon for a while. Recently, though, you can't throw a rock in the Marvel Universe without hitting Tony Stark, and I've been following the excellent current run by Charles and Daniel Knauf, as well as his appearances in other titles like Captain America, and reading the collected editions of his classic stories.Looking only at the plot, this is a pretty standard origin film; we get the modern version of Tony's beginnings as detailed by Warren Ellis in 'Extremis' (with Afghanistan instead of Vietnam), and Pepper Potts is Tony's Girl Friday, though otherwise this is strongly influenced by the Layton/Michelinie period, particularly the presence of James Rhodes as the lead male supporting character, the main villain, Obadiah Stane (he doesn't last enough to be christened the Iron Monger formally, though he uses the term in conversation earlier), and Tony's immediate motivation for becoming a superhero, which is modelled heavily on 'Armour Wars'. But it's the execution, the details, and, yes, the Downey Jr., that make all the difference. Robert Downey Jr. owns all, no doubt; he's utterly fantastic as Tony Stark. Jeff Bridges is very strong as Stane; he's up there with McKellen and Defoe as realizing the best film villains of the current revival. At first I was a bit put off by Terrence Howard's voice as Rhodey (softer than I had imagined; in my head he's always been more of a Dorn/Haysbert type), but he's good; Paltrow does a good job too.The film is peppered with setup for future stuff: SHIELD (and, if you stay after the credits, ole Nick himself, talking about his 'Avenger Initiative'), an expansive terrorist network referred to as the 'Ten Rings' (of the Mandarin), and, my favourite, Rhodey vowing 'next time, baby' on seeing a silver-grey suit of Iron Man armour.Mild criticism might be that the final defeat of the Iron Monger is vague and not especially climactic, but it suits the purpose well enough, and the preceding fight between the two armoured knights is awesome.10/10.",10,22,41,1 May 2008
Casino Royale," Craig, Daniel Craig is excellent as James Bond
","All in all, it was a very good film. Daniel Craig was excellent as Bond, although I do miss Pierce Brosnan a bit (he did a great job of making Bond a serious character, even if the scripting didn't always back him up).After the perceived excesses of the more recent Brosnan films (fans keep coming back to the invisible car), things are heavily scaled back here, with no Q, and almost no cool gadgets. The fights are, to quote Thomas Hobbes, 'nasty, brutish, and (not really) short.' The highlight is a stairwell showdown where Bond struggles to fend off some machete-wielding villains and keep Vesper (Eva Green) out of harm's way. Green, who, as anyone who has seen 'The Dreamers' can attest, is stunningly beautiful, and probably my second-favourite Bond girl (after Michelle Yeoh in 'Tomorrow Never Dies').Since they've got the origin story down, I hope they don't keep people like Q and Monneypenny out of future installments just to 'be different.' There were practical reasons in this one, since neither has much to do in the novel, but they're important parts of the films. This whole film was sort of a lead-up to the unveiling of Craig as the 'Bond as we know him,' complete with theme song, so I'm not concerned.I know nothing about poker beyond some of the terminology (straight flush, full house, etc.), but the exposition from Mathis was a bit of an embarrassment in an otherwise low-key film. I don't think the filmmakers needed to explain what 'all in' means to the audience.",10,0,2,27 December 2006
Before Sunrise," Young love.
","After seeing Richard Linklater's 'Before Sunset', and loving every minute of it, I resolved to find the film that 'Sunset' was a followup to: 1995's 'Before Sunset'. Both films star Ethan Hawke ('Dead Poets Society') and Julie Delpy ('White') as Jesse and Celine, two star-crossed lovers who have a penchant for engaging in long conversations on a wide variety of topics. In 'Sunrise', Jesse and Celine meet while on a train to Vienna. Jesse is sightseeing in Europe, having been dumped by his girlfriend who he had originally intended to spend his vacation with. Celine is on her way back from a visit to her grandmother. Jesse is going to catch a plane in Vienna back to the United States, and convinces Celine to get off with him. The two wander around Vienna, talking, encountering the locals, and, of course, falling in love. The plot of 'Before Sunrise' is minimalist; the film depends on the strength of the two lead actors, and the dialogue they are given. Fortunately, both are very strong. I prefer 'Sunset' to 'Sunrise', but both are excellent productions. I give 'Sunrise' an 8, compared to the 10 I gave 'Sunset'.",8,1,3,18 September 2004
Beowulf," A decent adaptation, dragged down by Zemeckis' choices.
","'Beowulf' is the classic work of Old English literature, but, truth be told, it really isn't much of a story, when viewed in a modern sense; Beowulf fights Grendel, Grendel's mother, and a dragon, winning in each case simply because he can, dying in the final combat, which is completely disconnected from the previous two parts. Tolkien forgive me, but that is my view of the story. Here, Gaiman and Avary solve the structural problem of the disconnect between the first two acts and the third; at the same time the story changes rather dramatically, and is no longer a straightforward heroic tale, but a story about a flawed hero perpetrating a lie and having to face the consequences. Devotees of the classic will take issue with this, but I don't. I find this story a lot more interesting.The major problem with this film is the way Robert Zemeckis chooses to film it. Zemeckis has always been very interested in pushing technical achievement in his film; 'Forrest Gump', for example made virtuoso use of editing and CGI to insert Tom Hanks into 40 years of American TV footage. However, in the last little while, his new project as become creating totally photo-real CGI, and he's lost the human element in the process. I am not saying that CGI cannot be used for human characters; Pixar has done so quite successfully; but attempts to completely replicate real actors simply have not worked yet, and, as detailed by the 'Uncanny Valley' effect, the closer they look to real, the more apparent the flaws in the technology become. The stylized humans in 'The Incredibles' and 'Ratatouille' were much more fully realized as characters. Zemeckis should either have shot this in live action, or animated it in a more animated fashion where such matters aren't important.Nevertheless, and interesting production.",7,1,3,7 December 2007
X2: X-Men United," What every comic book movie should be.
","2000's 'X-Men' was the first majorly successful comic book movie in many years, and it revived the entire genre.  It's sequel 'X2' arrived in theatres one year after 'Spider-Man' broke box office records, and with adaptations of many other comics either delivered or on the way.  Fans were legion in their anticipation, and the general public was waiting to see if the franchise would falter, or if it would soar.  It was the latter, clearly.  'X2' was truly glorious, perhaps the greatest comic book movie ever made. Director Bryan Singer returns to his creation (sadly, he will not finish the trilogy with 'X3'), and brings with him crack screenwriters like David Hayter.  The massive cast of the original film also returns, with some (Halle Berry) having significantly increased their star power since the original film. The villain this time around his Colonel William Stryker (Brian Cox, the original Dr. Hannibal Lecter), and his mind-controled mutant assistant Yuriko Oyama (Kelly Hu, a menacing presence, but with little to do). Stryker schemes to rid the world of all mutants, with the unwilling help of both Magneto (Ian McKellen) and Professor X (Patrick Stewart).  Stryker's plan involves using Professor X's mental powers to kill every mutant on the planet, and uses mind-control to get information from the imprisoned Magneto.  With Professor X and Cyclops in his grasp, and the remaining X-Men reeling from Stryker's assault, Magneto executes his escape from his plastic prison; he, Mystique, and the X-Men head to Canada to stop Stryker. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) feels that Stryker was involved in his past in some capacity, and this ads an additional level of intrigue.  Another addition to the X-Men is Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), a deeply religious mutant who was once controled by Stryker. Singer finds an excellent balance between action and character, and gives screentime to his entire cast (although some, like Professor X, are shortchanged).  He crafts some truly brilliant action sequences, the best being Nightcrawler's assault on the Oval Office. The cast is as good as before, with Berry making some improvement (but remaining the weak link; I'm not sorry that 'X3' will be without her). I give it a 9/10, and I hope that we can look forward to many more X-Men movies.",10,0,0,9 August 2004
Rear Window," Somewhat disappointing.
","As often happens when one experiences something after a great deal of build up, the primary emotion one feels is disappointment.  I had read for years how Alfred Hitchcock's 'Rear Window' was a masterpiece, one of the greatest and most suspenseful films ever made.  So when I finally rented it and watched it, I came away thinking it quite overrated. The film was rather unremarkable in my estimation, despite the superb work by the cast and the undeniable craftsmanship.  It just didn't seem particularly interesting to me. The cast was great.  Jimmy Stewart (a longtime favourite for his work in 'It's A Wonderful Life') is quite convincing as L.B. Jeffries, the photographer with a broken leg who is convinced his girlfriend is too good for him; Grace Kelly is truly luminous, and her work makes me want to see more of her movies; Thelma Ritter (from 'All About Eve') is great as Stella, Stewart's nurse.  Raymond Burr is good as the villain of the piece, Lars Thurwald, although he never becomes a truly great villain. Despite all that I've heard of Hitchcock's skill as a director, no sequence was really suspenseful to me, although many were quite interesting.",9,3,9,18 August 2004
Munich," Spielberg is still the master.
","I just saw Spielberg's latest film, in a theatre that was pretty close to packed; and the audience was almost entirely older people (40+).First of all, this is about the most un-Spielberg that Spielberg has ever been, even moreso than with Schindler's List; there are (at least, as far as I can see) none of the little moments that some people deride about SL (like the girl in the red dress, or Schindler's teary monologue near the end; personally, I didn't think they were inappropriate). There's one moment where Avner (Eric Bana) confesses to his wife (who's apparently named Daphna, but I don't recall it ever being said aloud; also, she's a total babe) that 'You're the only home I've ever had.' Daphna bursts out laughing at this, and remarks how corny that line was. It's almost like Spielberg is mocking his own past work.There is way more sex and violence than I can ever recall in one of Steven's past films; the violence is especially notable: there's blood everyone, pieces of brain, you name it. In one especially disturbing scene an Israeli athlete has a whole blown through his cheeks, but is otherwise fine.There are a lot of little moments, without any epic score or 'dramatic posing', that really get to you. For example, an Israeli athlete is about to escape from the compound by jumping out a window, but, noticing a butcher's knife lying on the floor, he grabs it and wordlessly charges back in, killing a terrorist before being machine-gunned to death. Performancewise, Eric Bana should get an Oscar nomination for his work here; it's a magnificent piece of work. However, his character is a rather closed individual, so he probably won't get anything.After this film, I'm convinced that Daniel Craig will be a particularly ruthless James Bond; his character is the only assassin who never has any real doubts about their mission.Ayelet Zorer, who plays Daphna, is also notable (and, as I said, extremely attractive). The 'loving wife' role is a bit thankless, but she is absolutely convincing. Actually, she may be my choice for this year's Best Supporting Actress.Geoffrey Rush, Ciaran Hinds, et al. do their usual quality work. Lynn Cohen's Golda Meir is only in the film at the beginning, but she's a formidable presence (she looks more like an old grandma, but she commands the whole room effortlessly).I give Munich 10/10.",10,0,1,7 January 2006
Thirteen Days," Another reason why Kevin Costner is underrated.
","Kevin Costner as an actor is thought of far too negatively by the public. Movies like 'Thirteen Days' and 'Open Range' show that he hasn't lost his touch after disasters like 'Waterworld'. 'Thirteen Days' tells the story of the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, with Costner as Kenny O'Donnell, an aide to President Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood, in an uncanny performance); O'Donnell was the old university roommate of Attorney General Robert Kennedy (Steven Culp, also fabulous). Costner's character has been beefed up, both to further the drama and to give Costner a bigger part, but it works well. O'Donnell functions as the normal man amongst extraordinary figures. JFK, RFK, and O'Donnell are the lead players on the American side, and come into conflict with the hawkish Joint Chiefs, led my General Taylor (Bill Smitrovich, who plays a lot of military roles). Another notable performance is that of Michael Fairman as Adlai Stevenson. Even though the conclusion is well known, the film manages to keep the audience guessing about what happens next. I give 'Thirteen Days' a 10.",10,0,1,31 December 2004
300," A faithful adaptation of Miller's source material.
","Frank Miller has, since the 1980s, been one of the most popular and influential creators in comics, almost his fame culminated in 1986's 'The Dark Knight Returns', and his later works have been less successful commercially. Despite Miller's fame, I have never been particularly impressed by his work, even of his supposed magnum opus, the aforementioned 'The Dark Knight Returns.' From what I have read, the highlight of his career was his early Marvel work on 'Daredevil', and everything since then has been fairly downhill, especially after 'Sin City', which, while adapted into a very fun film, typifies his work: completely devoid of any real value beyond crude entertainment, with no emotional investment, and obsessed with extreme violence and highly sexualized depictions of female characters.'300' is post-'Sin City' in Miller's career, and is basically the story of the legendary 300 Spartan warriors, with the usual Miller features: Madonna/whore women (tilted towards the latter), graphic violence, anti-gay humour (despite Spartans being historically homosexual). It's a fun entertainment, but nothing more, and certainly not a great movie. The technical merits are quite impressive (including the abdomens of the Spartan warriors, led by King Leonidas; Gerard Butler's performance has at the very least supplied fodder for innumerable internet parodies; Butler is not bad, let me be clear; he perfectly fits the histrionic, one-dimensional material, and I know him to be a very talented actor in other roles).This film did well enough to get Zack Snyder the job of directing Alan Moore's 'Watchmen', which will be the real test of his skill; he provided a convincing film translation of a one-dimensional story, and now he faces the Holy Grail of all mature, literate comics. We'll see how he does.",7,1,2,4 September 2007
The Bourne Supremacy," Low Key Espionage, High Intensity Film
","Having not seen The Bourne Identity, I entered the theatre to view its sequel with some trepidation.  I knew the basics of the series, and the second film reintroduces the key plot information succintly. The plot of The Bourne Supremacy is deceptively simple, although it appears muddled at times during the film.  I'm told that the plot of the movie has little relation to Robert Ludlum's book of the same name, but that doesn't matter to me as I have not read the book. Matt Damon is quite effective as Jason Bourne/David Webb, and his low key portrayal sets him apart from flashier spies.  The other key performances are from Brian Cox and Joan Allen, both of whom are very good.  Julia Stiles has a small role as well, although I'm ambivalent about her as an actress. My main complaint relates to director Paul Greenglass, whose hyperkinetic editing combines with the heavy use of handheld cameras to make the film jarringly difficult to watch at times.",8,2,2,24 July 2004
The Simpsons Movie," The show that defined a generation comes to the big screen.
","The above phrase in the title of my review ('defined a generation') is thrown around a lot about pieces of entertainment, but rarely is it so appropriate as it is in the case of 'The Simpsons', the animated program that debuted in 1989, and is now approaching its 20th season on television, with over 400 episodes released. To today's ten-year-olds, the show has always been around, and is generally regarded as a charming piece of comfort-food; to people of my age, who were young when it first came out, we remember when parents believed that the show was Public Enemy Number One, and disallowed us from watching it (but that didn't stop us). Bart, once 'America's bad boy', is now a cultural icon, and a fairly harmless one compared to the likes of Eric Cartman of 'South Park.' The controversy has long since worn off, and, after 13 seasons (in my estimation) of brilliance, the show is looking a bit tired these days, but it can still knock them out of the park occasionally.And now they come to the big screen. This has been the dream of many a fan and screenwriter for many years, and it arrives a bit past the point where it might have been most anticipated; fortunately, this doesn't affect the quality, although it is important to moderate expectations when approaching it. 'The Simpsons' is the greatest television program of all time, bar none; 'The Simpsons Movie' is not one of the greatest films of all time, by any means, and it doesn't come close. In part, this is because the show has already dealt with so many of the things a movie might have done; as well, a movie simply cannot capture the diversity of story and humour that can be found in the over 400 episodes currently released. However, it is a very funny movie, well worth one's money.The basic plot has been done many times before (Homer screws up, compromising his family and his town, and must grow up just enough to fix it), but it doesn't feel stretched out for film, and the animation is modified quite well for the big screen, seeming more epic while at the same time retaining the classic look of the show. And, despite the many times that Homer and Marge's marriage has foundered on the show, the big scene in this film where Marge believes (once again) that it's really over is truly excellent; it's a knockout bit of voice-acting from Julie Kavner.",9,1,2,4 September 2007
Atonement," An excellent turn from all involved.
","Like so many of the best films of 2007, 'Atonement' does not see wide distribution until 2008, owing to the practise of holding back the so-called Oscar-bait movies until limited release in December, to meet the Academy's deadlines while keeping the movies in the minds of voters. And so, at January's end, I finally got to see the new film adaptation of Graham McEwan's novel 'Atonement' (I have not read the novel).The story follows Cecilia and Briony Tallis, two sisters from an upper class family in interwar England, and Robbie, their groundskeeper who has also been patronized by their father, and gone on to some education. The opening segment (covering perhaps the first hour) is set in 1935, and shows how Cecilia and Robbie's burgeoning relationship becomes the victim of a lie told by Briony, who does not understand what she sees, and how her own feelings cause her to act. The next segment, set in 1940 on the eve of the 'miracle of Dunkirk', depicts the fallout of this lie, as Briony, now a young woman, tries to make up for what she has done. Finally, there is an epilogue set in the present day, where the question of Briony's atonement is examined at the end of her life.Briony, the central character, is played by three different actresses in the course of the film: first, Saoirse Ronan as a 13-year-old girl; by Romola Garai as an 18-year-old; and by acting legend Vanessa Redgrave as an old woman. All three actresses are fantastic; most of the critical acclaim, including an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, has accrued to Ronan as the young Briony, and she would be a worthy recipient of the award. Keira Knightley, the big name in the cast (re-teaming with Joe Wright, her director on 'Pride & Prejudice', one of my favourite recent films), is impressive, and develops good chemistry with James McAvoy as Robbie. Also present in a minor role is the great Brenda Blethyn (also of 'Pride & Prejudice').The most talked-about scene in the film is the depiction of the beaches of Dunkirk in the days of the evacuation. The five-minute continuous tracking shot of soldiers walking through the chaos has already become famous; there is tremendous poetry in Wright's visuals, as the music of singing soldiers swells, abandoned Ferris wheels absently turn, and horses are shot for lack of food and transport.The conclusion of the film is remarkably powerful, aborting the expectations of a traditional Hollywood period drama; sins, it seems, cannot always be made up for like in the movies. There is also the question raised of whether fiction can/should be used in the way Briony ends up using it, and whether she is simply continuing to deceive herself at the end of her life. This is by no means a happy film, and some unaware viewers expecting a companion piece to Knightley and Wright's 'Pride & Prejudice' should look elsewhere; but for an adult tragedy, this production has few compeers this year.",10,4,6,28 January 2008
