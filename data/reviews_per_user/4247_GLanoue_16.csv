Angels & Demons," Nice shots of Rome are not enough
","This adaptation of the Dan Brown novel of the same name tries hard to be faithful to the pseudo-erudite tone of the book but just doesn't quite make it. Ron Howard is not a subtle director; his straightforward style could have worked to simplify the book's complexities, but it doesn't. I think one of the major reasons is that it is a bad book, but the prequel Da Vinci code was so popular that the screenwriter and Howard were perhaps a bit too respectful. Howard, to give him credit, tries with a kind of chiaroscuro lighting scheme but even that doesn't seem to work. Many scenes are simply too dark, and chiaroscuro is light and dark combined. Rome is wonderfully lit at night, but nothing equals the daytime sky that inspired so many artists. Howard opted for night time scenes (like in the book) but this just muddies the images, since most are dark close ups rather than dramatically lit piazzas, churches and monuments. Light and dark only work in panoramic shots that can include both. Switching from light to dark doesn't work when the action is set at night. Second, the book insists in making John Langdon into something of a James Bond, Sean Connery style. This may be believable for some, but anyone who knows Harvard professors and 'symbologists' also knows that not too many are going to be running the 100 yard dash in under 10 seconds, swinging wildly from balustrades, and hold their breath under water for 30 seconds. Most of these guys are so used to talking that the underwater silence alone would kill them, not to mention the gymnastics and their bodies toned by thousands of hours in those armchairs. In brief, it is just not credible, as neither are the clues and riddles and Langdon's solutions to them: too easy. These are supposed to be the Illuminati, the greatest assembly of geniuses the world has ever seen, able to battle the greatest spy network in the world, the Vatican. Yet it alls seems a bit lowbrow. It's like the first book: playing word games in Latin may dazzle people who haven't studied the language, but they're not too difficult to figure out if you have. Hanks tries, as always. He is very good at being earnest as he gets older. Unfortunately, the female lead was not the love interest this time around, and no one really holds our interest except Ewan McGregor as the Camerlengo, the Chamberlain who is the eminence grise in the interregnum following a pope's death. He communicates the real power and responsibility he wields behind the scenes. Hanks' Langdon comes across as a clever but preachy high school teacher, and Vittoria Vetra is not a so convincing scientist that we believe she has found the mysterious 'God particle' at the heart of the plot. All in all, not a bad movie, and worth watching just for the shots of Rome (though these are not so good as a decent travelogue on the Discovery Channel), but not so interesting, and the lighting, meant to be provocative, is only irritating.",Null,0,0,18 September 2011
Skyfall," Psychological terror matches the terrifying action
","I was almost dreading this latest instalment in what must be the world's longest running franchise, thinking the writers couldn't possible sustain yet another Bond episode. Happily, I was wrong. This proves once again that once you get past the legacy of the special effects of the 1990s and the comic book villains of the earlier Bonds, scripting and casting are at the heart of any movie enterprise. Daniel Craig proves once again that the producers were absolutely right to cast him as a youngish (at first) Bond-type (we are never sure if this is a retro-ed Bond a la the recent Star Trek) who by now is accidentally wounded by his own partner and psychically wounded by all the killing and uncertain moral standards of the contemporary world. This, BTW, is explored very well in a subplot involving M (Judi Dench, in another incredible and understated performance) facing a parliamentary hearing into the screw up that led to Bond getting shot as he's trying to recover a hard disk with the names of Western agents infiltrated in terrorist groups. Obviously, Bond survives and goes underground, licking his wounds and wondering if it's all worth it. Apparently it is, when it turns out that this is part of a larger plot to discredit and eventually kill M, by a rogue agent that she allegedly abandoned in the field to be captured and tortured. He too survived, but with a different and very malignant mindset than Bond's, whose personal loyalty to M, though tested by his knowledge that she ordered the agent to take a difficult shot that missed the bad guy and hit him, overcomes his moral disgust with the institution. Dench, Craig and newcomer to the franchise Naomie Harris who plays the field agent with a shaky aim who later decides to ride a desk under the name of Eve Moneypenny (signs of the retro-ed story, as we are clearly in the contemporary world, with modern technology and modern bad guys even though we are viewing a prequel birth of the Bond world). And speaking of technology and bad guys, the movie gains quite a bit by having a new Q, a confused young genius not at all certain about his technology (twice, M and he set off a cyber attack by trying to backtrace a cyber attack, a feint that was designed to provoke the cyber response and open the door to real attack). It also has a scaled back the technology: a gun and a radio (albeit a gun with a grip keyed to Bond's palm print). It makes the menace and especially the confusing reactions to it all the more human and believable, since the threat is not really a superweapon from space or the ocean depths, but an evil person wreaking havoc by exploiting human weaknesses amplified by current technology. And what a menace it turns out to be – Javier Bardem is the best Bond villain in decades. He combines sadism, sadness, crazy-obsessive paranoia, complete indifference to others, yet with a modern vocabulary of caring and insight. It's like talking to your shrink, except he's packing a Glock with which he'll blow your kneecaps off once your 50 minutes are up, or maybe before if you don't have enough insight. Bardem is spooky and unnerving, since he's not really undone, unlike other Bond villains, by his own ego masquerading as crazy genius, and Bond/Craig is far from an invincible superhero as he faces off against an evildoer whose talking isn't merely an excuse to show off how clever he is (how many times have we wondered why No, Dax, Goldfinger, Blofeld and the rest didn't just shut up and simply shoot Bond?). Bardem and Craig really sell the idea that it is not at all foreordained that Bond will win the climactic battle. In brief, a wonderful addition to the franchise, showing that good writing (action and characterisation) is the key to a good movie",10,7,17,15 February 2013
In Bruges," The cityscape as the main protagonist
","As usual, a great script is the basis for this great film. The story turns on a series of highly improbable circumstances (which I won't mention to not spoil the enjoyment), but the script has managed to flesh out the characters sufficiently well that we even come to expect them, or at least regard them as normal in context. The camera work is excellent, with long, static shots of the cityscape, and with zooms reserved mostly for people shots, so we unconsciously accept how Bruges and its Medieval architecture becomes a powerful player in the story, and the protagonists' life and death decisions and actions (this is a crime and morality play, so I can safely reveal that there is a certain level of violence) seem almost arbitrary and meaningless compared to the permanence and therefore emotional force of the constructed landscape against which the action takes place. In fact, the script acknowledges this several times, since the protagonists in several crucial moments actually stop shooting each other to allow themselves to change locales that they think are more appropriate (the tower on the main square is the most importance example, though at least one scene involves Bruges' famous canals). Other normally important actions – there's a great scene with one criminal, a dwarf and two prostitutes in a nondescript hotel room – are interrupted or are inconclusive. It's as if meaningful action can only take place against the backdrop of the city's public places. David Lean's films, especially Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago, also tended to transform the environment from simple backdrop into an active protagonist. In Bruges does it in a much more subtle yet strangely effective manner, which is perhaps as it should be since the life and death situations in which the protagonists find themselves are all the result of venal, morally disgusting and illegal activities. The city, unbeknown to them, works its magic (despite that Ray one of the killers on the lam describes it as a 'shithole') and brings each of them to their just desserts, hell or redemption, or perhaps both. All in all, an extremely well-crafted film that makes believable the improbable and underscores the futility of individual human action (cities are the symbol of the entire community par excellence). I haven't mentioned the actors, but Colin Farell's excesses for once are used to good effect, and Ralph Fiennes and Brendan Gleason are excellent as usual, and the excellent and underplayed script allows the secondary actors to shine as well. All in all, a great little movie. Life and Death in L.A. makes sense, in America, but here, life and death have strangely little effect or impact, since the location makes it such that life or death are almost predestined and thus meaningless as individual destinies.",9,1,3,13 March 2011
Unbreakable," Even comic book heroes get the blues
","This underrated film is a pleasant antidote to Hollywood's emphasis on special effects. Bruce Willis is a reluctant superhero who takes years to come to grips with his powers – a form of psychic sensitivity, unnatural strength, and, of course, the fact that he is almost indestructible. Samuel L. Jackson is his antithesis – cerebral (Willis, as I said, has trouble figuring things out), physically fragile to the point of being known as Mr Glass, and for most of the film, relatively immobile and confined to a wheelchair. This film's strong points are its dark, muted colours, its lazy rhythm (long shot lengths) combined with constant slow panning, and its cast. Willis is terrific as a man psychically tortured by his strengths (he has trouble connecting with his wife, his job, and his life in general) who is trying to flee the growing realisation that he doesn't belong, while Jackson is excellent as a man emotionally twisted by his physical impotence. The dialogue is terse, minimalist, and contextualised in an intelligent way, since the thesis-antithesis plot is voiced mostly by Jackson in his character as an art dealer specialising in comic books. Appropriately, the visual imagery analysed and presented by Jackson (which is largely correct, BTW, especially the emphasis on large heads and skewed eyes on villains) acts as a counterpoint and bait to Willis, a kind of blind Argos. Willis' son communicates well the appropriate stunned look of alienation, so we understand his emotional investment in helping his father understand his destiny. The denouement is interesting: Jackson sees all, at least in terms of the comic book logic that has been his one crutch throughout his life, yet we discover that he is just as emotionally crippled as he is physically weak, while Willis slowly comes to see his role not as someone made special by his powers, but as someone whose destiny is to be conventionally honest, moral and kind. What is the message? That real heroism is facing the everyday 'evil' of banality (Willis is a security guard who lives in a somewhat grotty home)? Perhaps. I don't think that other actors could have worked so well together to convey this slowly growing tension between blindness and sight, strength and weakness. Okay, Shyamalan has been parodied especially on Robot Chicken for sticking to his formulaic 'twists' that seem too pat, too deus ex machina, but here it works because the underlying narrative structure of the filmic action is the simple black or white logic of comic book morality. Even for the tortured superheroes that have followed on the heels of Spiderman, a sudden twist at the end is appropriate for the war of good and evil. I don't think he chose the comic book backstory for Jackson's character by accident. Yet, despite the apparent simplicity of the moral imperatives that are its backbone, the film manages to provoke.",9,1,1,4 January 2012
Troy," Legend without the myth
","I find it amusing that people criticise this movie as historically inaccurate. Of course it is, like an old-fashioned John Ford Cowboys and Indians movie that inspires schoolyard kids to reprise the mythic purity and simplicity of the theme. I mean, steel cuts into flesh with an added sound effect of a knife sharpener, like Stars Wars explosions make noise in airless space? Okay, we accept this is a fable, all the more reasons to treat it as such. But director Petersen also took out the mythological element that made the story more real for ancient listeners of the tale (which is interesting, since it can be argued that his other 'realistic' films – Das Boot, Enemy Mine – are structured like myths). Myth for the Greeks (who didn't yet exist as such at the time of Troy nor even in Homer's day) would have been seen as enhancing the story, not making it less realistic, as one might expect from a modern perspective. In the original, gods and goddesses weave in and out of the plot, sometimes favouring one side and then the other. Homer's audience would have understood: the achievements of men count for little faced with the power and caprices of the supernatural and all it stood for. People who thought otherwise were guilty of hubris. The problem for the modern spectator is that the lack of myth is supposed to make the story more real. In fact, it means it depends entirely on the psychological dimension, so it is easy to judge this movie. Is the action sufficiently motivated by the scripted emotions conveyed by the actors? The answer of course is no. The actors are good, but their emotional depth seems misplaced since we are not provided with any real clues to account for the force of these emotions driving them to a ten year long murderous frenzy. In fact, the movie reduces the war to cupidity, greed and schoolboy notions of honour and masculinity (by the 'Greeks'; the Trojans are in fact more complex psychologically because they are defending their homeland from the imperialist invaders). But the decision to motivate the action prosaically leaves Petersen in a bind, and so the photography, costumes, montage and even the score to a certain extent become 'mythic', with old-fashioned long shots (now undoubtedly aided by CGI) to show the epic proportions of the battles, loving shots of the 'eternal Aegean', of 'sad' sunsets signalling death, of mighty walls, choreographed balletic duels, and so on. Myth and its richness are thus reduced to things – armour details, dramatic lighting – and plays no role in the human. This could have been a great film. As it stands, it is a great failure. You read Homer once, you never forget it. You could watch this film 20 times and even admire its technical prowess, but it is in the end forgettable.",5,0,1,6 March 2011
The Bourne Ultimatum," fast pace, too fast
","Excellent action movie. Pacing was great, but the use of 1990s style hand held camera to create a fake docudrama feel at the beginning was jarring. I know the director wants this to create continuity between the action scenes and slow paced dialogue, but the movie would have been better if the action was subtly highlighted by more static camera angles, I think. Damon as always is highly believable, and as usual in these huge budget action films, the supporting actors are great. There's an ensemble feel to the cast, as well there might be since there is some continuity (Stiles, Allen) with the first. The story was comfortably complex without too many twists, and the action was believable, even when they fight through the incredible amount of pain the protagonists inflict on each other. All in all, a credible effort.",9,3,4,4 January 2011
Salt," Angelina's most excellent adventure
","This I guess is supposed to be Angelina's breakout vehicle, the movie where she shows us she can out Schwarzenegger Bruce Willis, that she doesn't depend on her looks (she even disguises herself as a MAN, how brave is that?), that she can communicate complex plot lines with a sultry stare; oh wait, we're back to the beautiful woman thing again. Damn. I guess this means she'll shop around for another breakout vehicle, which means we'll be tortured one more time. Jolie, who is fast becoming the Liz Taylor of her generation with multiple babies substituting multiple husbands, is resting on her IRL fame. I get that this is an action flick and not a documentary, but it is simply not believable that a 95 lb woman can outfight about 50 two hundred pound trained bruisers, not to mention outwit the combined intelligence agencies of the USSR, Russia, and the US, oh wait, maybe that part could be believable, given the US president's wooden dialogue and plot holes large enough to accommodate several ICBMs. It's good for a laugh, I suppose, and some credit should be given to Jolie for performing without showing us once even one inch of cleavage (she clearly used a body double in the opening scenes in the North Korean prison, where all prisoners are apparently forced to wear Victoria's Secret naughty things as part of their re-education and brainwashing. God, that Kim Jong Il is SO diabolical).",2,1,4,26 February 2011
The Love Guru," The most democratic movie possible: insults everyone
","All I can say is, wow. Is it possible that a once talented showman became so suicidal that he managed to talk people into giving him 60 million dollars so he could make this career-ender? Masochism is a multi-layered thing. This movie is one long puerile penis joke. What was funny in the context of trailer park losers Wayne and Garth twenty years ago has become an insult to the public. Myers is nearly 50 years old, for heaven's sake, and the best he can come up with is two elephants copulating on the ice in game 7 of the Stanley Cup? Are people that venal to star in this POS? I understand Jessica Alba, like who knew it would be this bad, but the others? There's no excuse to compromise other people's careers if Myers has a death wish, which he apparently does. Penis jokes, testicle jokes, scrotum jokes, ass jokes, it's all too much. Not to mention racist, an insult to Indians, to Maple Leaf fans, to short people, to Jessica Alba fans, to everyone. I guess this is also a tribute to the Hollywood system, where Myers' inflated ego on the basis of the Shrek cash cow can actually convince real human beings to give him a gadzillion dollars. I won't even mention the starving Africans and Indians who could have used the money, it's an insult to them. Hell, building a sewage treatment plant with this money would have done humanity a major favour. Didn't anyone have the courage somewhere along the line to tell Myers to reign it in, to hire a decent scriptwriter if he no longer has it, or just perhaps to rest on his Shrek laurels and play golf? What's really disturbing isn't that this isn't funny (most things aren't), but that it's really mean-spirited. The only redeeming features are Justin Timberlake (who knew?) and a Verne Troyer outtake over the credits. The other 89 and a half minutes should be consigned to Heaven's Gate hell, and Myers should apologise to everyone involved.",1,12,23,12 February 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," The great mystery of life, for dummies
","This movie is supposed to be provocative and thoughtful, with its references to the eternal struggle between free will and an omnipotent God. Who's the boss? could be the subtitle of this movie. In fact, it debases the central question that has forever plagued eastern and western philosophers alike. In the end, it has little content beyond what we would hear in a high school debate. There are too many shortcuts and just not enough fleshed-out ideas for a movie that claims to be tackling The Grand Mystery of the Universe, but it takes itself way too seriously to be Monty Python-esque about it and come up with credible answers: the angels are supposed to be the enforcers of a master plan, yet they have hobbled powers; they have to wear stupid 1960s Mad Men hats in contemporary Manhattan; couldn't God have just given them key cards to open doors? Not to mention that the secret of their power is that they twist doorknobs counter-clockwise to enter their secret realm. Who would have thought? The two main characters are always conveniently single whenever they meet over the years. More importantly, John Slattery is not so believable as the head field agent in charge of making sure people stick to The Master Plan. He comes across as a little too slick, too corporate, and too efficient but without any passion. In fact, the whole Plan thing is presented along those lines: the Adjustment Bureau personnel seem to drive Miami CSI style SUVs, they are headquartered in a huge warehouse, the minions seem hard at work on The Plan in a large retro-style library. It's a little like watching Jack Lemmon's The Apartment, but colorized. Perhaps the most important thing is that Matt Damon and Emily Blunt have no believable chemistry when they are together, so it's hard to accept that two young and attractive people are saving themselves and avoiding romantic entanglements for seven years so they can eventually be together and buck The Master Plan cooked up by God Himself. Plus, it irks me that the whole movie reduces what could have been an interesting idea played by otherwise good actors to the tired American cliché that Love Will Find a Way and Triumph. Really? Two people are only mildly attracted to each other at the level of a first date (Blunt even tells Damon, at one of the climax points, that he doesn't know anything about her) in a cinematically unconvincing way, and this is supposed to be enough to come to the attention of God, halt the machinations of dozens of angels working on the case to set things back on track, and rewrite the master plan for all of humanity? Somebody seems to have given Damon novocain in his morning decaf, because he shows as much passion as a mushroom, and Blunt, while acting credibly, is just given too many bad one-liners that alienate the audience. We don't know if she's just bitchy, flippant or wary of Damon stalking her. She's supposed to be a dancer that changes the world of dance, yet the dancing we see looks like it was choreographed by high-schoolers; Damon is supposed to become a President that will change the world for the better, but the only evidence of his acumen and grit is a clichéd concession speech in which he admits to the image manipulation that lies behind political campaigns. Wow. I'm stunned. They hire consultants so his shoes can match his ties? So it's not about ideas? Thanks, Matt, that's a major revelation, which encapsulates more or less what's wrong here: we're continually told to be on the lookout for something earthshaking, and it's just, in the end, a case of lust. Yuri Zhivago pursuing Lara across Siberia, across wars and revolutions, writing poems that survive Stalinism, and in the end dying for her: that was earthshaking love. This? Pfft.",Null,1,3,12 November 2011
Zero Dark Thirty," Boring and self-serving
","Imagine the Da Vince Code without two generations of conspiracy theorists nourishing our fears that things aren't what they seem to be, or imagine a WWII movie without the subtext of moral outrage at Pearl Harbour or Auschwitz. Without the desire for payback and closure for 9-11, this movie is shallow and conventional. It cheats by hitting all the right moral triggers: Evil Mastermind Osama Bin Laden, torture is bad but necessary to Protecting Our Freedoms (yes, in capitals; it's that kind of movie). But it's not a gung ho John Wayne's Green Beret style movie. We're way too cynical for that. Director Bigelow gives a knowing wink to the audience that we're beyond old fashioned and simple minded patriotism; we get gratuitous scenes in which women and high ranking officials like Leon Panetta/James Gandolfini swear like troopers, or women talk about sex as a relaxing distraction from the job, or the head torturer saying that he's had enough not because of moral doubts but because he's seen too many naked guys: We Edgy Now. Once everybody agrees that we're hip, cynical and patriotic, all we get is a conventional Cowboys and Indians movie: the bad guys are really bad, but we're still good because our doubts about our methods (waterboarding) prove we're still on the moral high ground. The fact is that this is a boring movie underneath the documentation of all the slick CIA procedures and technology: a maverick (Chastain) insists she is right all along, and convinces her superiors by sheer strength of will that Osama is hiding out in a city and not in the mountains. The movie highlights guts, intuition, determination, and even insight, but Maya/Chastain has no real facts on which to hang her case. So, we have a gung-ho, me against the world movie that is carried by cheap Hollywood contrivances: the loner, the maverick, the hunch-player, the High Plains Drifter, and a woman to boot, so her one dimensional obsession is morally unassailable in today's political climate. Here, the outraged Chastain/Maya had the advantage, because we all know she was right all along. All the buzz is about the use of torture, payback and closure for 9-11, and a voyeuristic fascination with the SEAL team that took down Osama. It's not about the movie, which didn't deserve its nominations, hype and ticket sales. I'm not taking a pro- or anti-US position here; all I want is a better movie.",5,3,7,16 April 2013
Inception," Bad, slow, pretentious.
","This overly-hyped movie tried to be too clever by half and didn't even manage to pull off a Matrix-type pretentiousness. It's just bad, substituting elementary (and wrong) psychobabble for plot. It's science fiction and fantasy, it doesn't have to conform to real life but it should conform to its own rules. The acting was wooden, which is due to the bad script because each of these actors can hold their own elsewhere. The pacing is glacial. We are continually being preached at about the subconscious, but it's all like an Agatha Christie novel, with a surprise, unforeseen and unannounced deus ex machina just popping up here and there to wrap things up. Like, it's really complicated because there are these things called 'levels' to dreaming and the subconscious. If the director spent ten years writing this script, he should get another job. It looks like it was pasted together in a couple of days over a few too many mai-tais. Some interesting visuals, but that's all there is.",1,31,58,31 December 2010
Taken 2," Unbelievable bad guys.
","If I were Albanian, I would be thinking of organising some sort of boycott for the way my people are portrayed in this sequel to the well-made 2008 hit. Not because the movie portrays Albanians as criminals, but as bad criminals. Honestly, is this the best the casting director and scriptwriter could come up with? No scary dialogue, no scary people. Just thugs with AKs and Glocks. Okay, that's scary, but basically it's surprising they don't all shoot themselves in the foot. The chief baddie out for revenge because his son was killed in Paris just looks like a tired old man with a bad haircut. He spends must of his time sitting in an empty room. Inexplicably, he suffers from the Blofeld syndrome: once Neeson and his ex are captured, he talks too much while setting up the usual 'horrendous death' scenario and actually leaves the room, allowing Neeson time to escape, coordinate his daughter's rescue, and contemplate lots of scenery. His henchmen look like gorillas in track suits. This is supposed to be the cream of the dreaded Albanian mafia? And the Turks, who are wary of Kurds so are no slouches when it comes to police work, look incompetent, corrupt and stuck with old, modified Ladas as police cars. Usually, it's a bad script that's the problem in a bad movie – and Lord knows this one is no Oscar contender – but here the problem is really casting. Not only are the crooks bad, the daughter (Maggie Grace) looks like she's aged 20 years since the last film. She's supposed to be about 18 or 19, in reality the actress is 29, and she looks like 39, or maybe 29 with too much partying. Back home, she can hardly drive in an empty parking lot with an automatic, having failed her driving test twice. In Istanbul, she steals a stick shift and can suddenly outclass a Finnish rally car champion – in Istanbul, mind you. How? Liam is in fine form and has improved his horribly fake American accent slightly (which was I think the basis for a Robot Chicken sketch), but even he looks a little long in the tooth for the action sequences, or maybe he's just a bit bored playing a role that he can do in his sleep, where he's not even called on to be outraged. The beautiful mommy and ex-wife Famke Janssen doesn't have much to do except suffer; there's some sort of inexplicable deus ex machine subplot with hubby number 2 leaving her as a prelude to cancelling a reconciliation attempt that was supposed to be a vacation, all as an elaborate scheme to explain how the mommy and daughter meet Liam in Istanbul where the Albanians track them down and get to work. In brief, none of the believable bad buys and outraged father of the original – Neeson is sleepwalking, despite the high octane action sequences, Janssen is mostly unconscious, and daughter Grace transforms from alienated mall girl to 007 as soon as she gets her hands on a grenade, which daddy Liam conveniently carries around. Any positives in this mess? Well, obviously these movies are well made in a technical sense, if you don't expect any sort of character-driven plot (there isn't any, not a shred, except the old Albanian's desire for revenge). The action sequences are fine. That's it. Sappy script, wooden acting, bad casting. Watchable, but barely.",3,0,0,10 February 2013
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Emotional angst with a light touch.
","This wonderful and light hearted look at what we want and don't want is proof that Woody Allen is becoming a better film maker with age, and that a movie can be serious and funny at the same time. Here, two friends from America, Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall, arrive in Barcelona for a summer abroad and discover that love, desire and passion can turn emotional rigidity (Hall) into existential angst and uncertainty, while emotional failure to commit (Johansson) can become stability and acceptance, or at least, as the movie says as its last word, the certainty of what one doesn't want (in fact she achieves stability only as the glue that binds together a dysfunctional couple, but I don't want to reveal too much). Scripted and directed with economy, this is the rare movie with a voice-over narration that doesn't jar and doesn't actually impose a narrative structure on the viewer, although of course its content strives to. The acting and script are so good that Allen lets the narrative line and especially the psychological tension linking the four main characters emerge on their own, through the characters' interactions (besides Hall and Johansson, there is an understated and 'truthful' Bardem and Penelope Cruz as Bardem's unstable ex wife who can only attain equilibrium in a triangular relationship with Bardem and Hall). A wonderful blend of having what we need and what we want, and all the uncertainty and danger that accompanies choice. The really interesting aspect for me was that Johansson and Hall both speak in Allen's well known intonations and rhythms, restarting sentences right before getting to the verb, tonal hesitations, and even a little Bronx whine creep into their inflections. To make sure we get the contrast between want and need as sometimes being one and the same, Hall is dark and of course Johansson is blonde, but the two are often shot with camera angles that underscore their physical resemblance. The real trick achieved by Allen is the ending, where Hall goes back to her ordered New York existence after flirting with emotional danger, and Johansson goes on to the emotional anomie that defines her existence and ironically gives her strength and stability. In other words, back to the beginning. Fans are often unusually vocal in their enthusiasm for Allen in the first few weeks after one of his movies comes out, and then settle down. He does appeal to that literate and sometimes pseudo intellectual crowd. This, I think is no exception. However, it will stand the test of time, in part because Allen continues to grow as a filmmaker who can nuance the human heart without the egocentricity that dominated his earlier films, and partly because he now attracts even better actors to his projects.",9,1,2,22 March 2011
RED," Decent Willis vehicle
","This film brings nothing new to the genre (old codgers show they still got spunk, like the last thirty years of the life of almost-eternal George Burns in art and in life). I don't however agree with some of the extremely negative reviews. Yes, it may be hard to see great actors like Mirren and Freeman hamming it up, but what the hell, they looked like they were having fun, and we all know that good roles aren't that easy for ageing stars – Mirren can hardly redo Elizabeth, can she? Sure, the thing is full of clichés, and there are several improbable segues. But we're all supposed to be grown ups by now, having seen a gadzillion Bourne type flicks, so we know that all spies keep hidey-holes full of weapons, passports and money, so we shouldn't gripe that it's not explained in the film. Just take it as a given for the genre, sit back and enjoy the decent pacing, minimalist script (for once!), sympathetic actors (Mary Louise Parker is a major scene-stealer), and great casting for the secondary parts (Brian Cox as a shady Russian, Richard Dreyfus as an arms dealer who's channelling Dick Cheney, Rebecca Pidgeon as a CIA boss dragon lady). It's a Bruce Willis action slash comedy slash rom-com, for heaven's sake. Judged on its own terms, it's decent, well crafted, and I certainly didn't feel my time was wasted. Casablanca also started its mythic journey as a well-made B film. This one won't age as well, of course, since comedies especially topical comedies never do, but for now its nice to see good actors having fun.",7,0,0,23 February 2011
Jurassic Park," Trite and overblown insult to collective intelligence
","It's perhaps not fair to judge a film 20 years after it came out, but on the other hand, that's how people define classics. This film fails. Yes, stunning CGI effects. Great photography. But the script is horrible. First, Spielberg's standby dysfunctional American family is in full bloom, with smart aleck kids and incompetent adults who when faced by technical challenges and alleged science seem to have an attention span of a five year old. No one listens to anyone else, no one collaborates, and the only voice of reason philosopher Dr Malcolm is played by Jeff Goldblum as a caricature. Every conceivable corny camera set up or angle is exploited, every lush note of John William's heroic score is designed to substitute the lack of human chemistry among the cast, every character reacts in a stereotypical fashion. Granted, perhaps Spielberg wanted idiot-savants (kids and adults alike) to showcase the dinos' personality, but even here we are treated to ridiculously anthropomorphised creatures instead of nature in the raw. I mean, dinos opening doors? The T-Rex was scary because it was hunting, not playing. Even the park's UNIX computer system is given a ridiculously amusing and needlessly complicated graphics Next-Generation interface to heighten the drama of rebooting the system after it is sabotaged. Not that this interface wasn't doable in 1993, but no one-of specialised system would have anything but text commands for such a massively complicated park. So, humanised computers, humanised dinos, but one dimensional humans. If it wasn't for the massive publicity campaign that let it slip that the film was 'about' hubris and so worthy of being taken seriously, this wouldn't pass muster with any but the simple-minded. In the end, the script is completely predictable, and no amount of gorgeous camera work can substitute hackneyed plotting.",5,2,8,2 January 2014
The Island," Fast action, credible script
","I am a little perplexed why this film got panned and did so poorly at the box office. Interestingly, it earned a lot more overseas, so perhaps Europeans (mostly) have a different view of things? This story is not really new: in the near future, scientist (Merrick, well played by Sean Bean) figures out a way for rich people to grow clones for spare parts, who are given artificial memories and kept on an island until needed. One (Lincoln Six Echo/Ewan McGregor) becomes aware he and the others are not survivors of some global ecological catastrophe who are being saved to reproduce humanity; through a flaw in the programme that instills memories, he seems to acquire the memories of his biological matrix, a rich and dissolute motorcycle designer (also McGregor, of course) who needs a clone for an eventual liver transplant. Lincoln escapes with his friend Jordan Two Delta/Scarlett Johansson, who doesn't do so much in the movie, but looks great and does what she does best, which is to suggest a latent sexual power. The action is carried by a credible McGregor and his nemesis, a relentless mercenary Albert Laurent/Djimon Hounsou hired to bring back or kill the escaped clones. This movie has some of the best action scenes around, because they are entirely credible: Johansson and McGregor seem as lucky as they are proficient at running away from Hounsou, which keeps things believable. The science behind it also comes out as needed: we don't get the one colossal lecture about how things work (like in the older James Bond movies when Goldfinger or Dr. No reveals his plan for global domination). Sparse science is good in science fiction. The writers thankfully do not include details meant to convince us the science is real, as when a character tells the audience when cloning was invented, by whom, when, etc. Here, it is just taken for granted that trains will fly in the sky; technical achievements are balanced by a social dystopia: rich and poor live in different worlds; human life is obviously cheap (the mercenaries just shoot up anything that gets in their way), etc. Also, the movie has a lot of relatively funny but low-key parts: when McGregor's human friend Steve Buscemi chooses costumes for Johansson to wear instead of the island-issued jump suit, for example, or when McGregor-Evil Designer matrix realises his clone is running around with Johansson but is still a virgin (that sounds wrong, no insult intended to Ms Johansson; I should have said 'running around with Johansson's character'). So, what's wrong with this movie? Well, the inevitable preachy ending, where McGregor/Lincoln returns to the island with Jordon/Johansson and frees the slaves, I mean, clones (Lincoln, get it?) after a showdown with evil genius Merrick, and when the mercenary reveals he 'understands' oppression and changes sides. Okay, it had to end somehow, but the operatic choral ensemble as they walk off the island in their Rudi Gernreich Space 1999 jumpsuits (remember Barbara Bain?) reminds me of those 1990s British Airways commercials set to The Flower Duet by Delibes. Overall, it's as if they shot sequentially and had already spent most of their special effects budget for the earlier chase scenes. All in all, a gripping film. I especially liked that it avoided excessive preaching about clones and harvesting human beings. It lets its images (the mercenaries' indifference to human life) and its actors (such as a very convincing Bean as an evil idealist who thinks the clone technology will save more lives than it claims – not new, but Bean can pull this kind of fluff off in his sleep) communicate its message, such as it is. I think perhaps Americans expect huge casts and crews in this kind of film, but here it comes down to a dozen actors in chase scenes; strangely, it's a 'talky' but low-key intellectual film despite the high grade action, so maybe this explains why Europeans seemed to like it more. Worth watching: fast paced, well acted, economic script.",9,0,0,24 March 2013
