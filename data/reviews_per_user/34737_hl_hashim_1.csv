The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Love it
","This is one of my ultimate favorite films, I love the main character's development and this movie as a whole. I never get enough of it. Although the movie doesn't completely cover the book but it was arranged amazingly, the cast, direction and everything. I must admit the first time I've watched this I was in tears throughout the entire film, not sure why but after re-watching it several times it turned into my go to feel good movie. It doesn't have the clich√© everyone gets what they want ending nor does it have the everyone is miserable in the end thing either, the ending is one of my favorite parts of the movie and I recommend this movie to anyone interested in the whole 'not okay teenagers' cause it takes the matter somewhat realistically.",10,1,3,27 April 2015
