The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," 'The Double Life of Veronique' is an abs...
","'The Double Life of Veronique' is an absolutely beautiful movie in every sense.  The film tells the story of two identical-looking women, the Polish Veronika and the French Veronique, who seem to be aware of each other in some way, but who have never met.  The movie doesn't attempt to explain the similarity of these characters; it is far more interested in telling their stories and leaving the mystery as a sort of resonant background that colors the events that unfold.  The radiantly beautiful Irene Jacob plays the double role of the title characters, and she is brilliant; the film doesn't give her very much dialog, but she communicates volumes with her facial expressions and body language.  The cinematography is gorgeous, with most of the film shot through amber-colored filters of one form or another, essentially eliminating the color blue from the movie and giving everything a slightly distant look.After seeing Kieslowski's three subsequent movies, his wonderful 'Three Colors' trilogy, it seemed to me that 'Veronique' was almost intended to be a prequel to them, with scenes in each movie alluding to scenes in the others.  Certainly, anyone who loved 'Three Colors' will appreciate 'Veronique' as well.Overall Rating:  9 (out of 10), or 4 starts (out of 4)",9,5,9,6 August 1998
The Exorcist," A Disappointment
","Since its release, 'The Exorcist' seems to have played a very large role in the popular culture.  Even 25 years after its original opening, references to projectile vomiting or someone turning their head all the way around immediately recall this movie.  So, when I finally sat down to watch this film, I had high expectations.  Sadly, these expectations were not met. The effects were very well done, and the movie was quite scary in places (more so than silly slasher flicks like 'Friday the 13th', anyway), but the plot and character development left much to be desired.  Ellen Burstyn's character, the mother of the possessed girl, is one-dimensional at best, and is frequently very annoying, while Max von Sydow's Father Merrin seems almost totally undeveloped despite spending a fair amount of time on the screen.  The only human character with any interesting development at all is Jason Miller's Father Karras.  The most important character, though, and the one whose development is perhaps most lacking, is the Devil himself. He possesses this little girl, and does all sorts of disgusting and violent things with her, but his motives in doing so are totally unexplained.  In this regard, the climax of the film also seems terribly silly.  Frankly, if the sort of stuff shown in this film is the best that the Devil can do, I wouldn't be too terribly scared of him.Overall Rating: 5 (out of 10), or 2 stars (out of 4)",6,0,5,8 September 1998
Event Horizon," Creepy, But Mindless
","'Event Horizon' could have been a really impressive movie.  The visuals are nice, and the film does have a couple of genuinely creepy and frightening moments, which is more than can be said for quite a few so-called horror films.  However, the movie is badly compromised by characters that move about as mindless slaves to the plot, as well as by some excruciatingly bad science.  Now, this is a science fiction movie, and as a longtime fan of science fiction, I am willing to concede such unlikelihoods as their faster -than-light drive and artificial gravity; however, the gross and unnecessary violations of well-understood physics (such as the fact that the ships seem to be both indside Neptune's atmosphere and motionless with respect to it and orbiting the planet at the same time; ask yourself why you don't see satellites 'orbiting' in the atmosphere of Earth) and the ridiculously artificial technical complications completely destroy my willing suspension of disbelief.  For years, I have been waiting to see a space-opera-type science fiction movie come out of Hollywood that shows even close to the level of sceintific and technical knowledge shown by the great majority of successful hard science fiction writers.  I am still waiting.Overall Rating:  4 (out of 10), or 1 and 1/2 stars (out of 4)",3,2,4,19 August 1998
