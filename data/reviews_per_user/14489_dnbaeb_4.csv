Hereditary," It was ok and kind of interesting...
","Until the last 20 minutes. Totally lost me in terms of tying this back to the grandmother and why the sister was born in the wrong body, etc., etc. I think they tried to answer questions at the very end, but it just fell short in my opinion. I think this could have been accomplished in less than 2:07 minutes.",5,2,4,2 February 2020
Aquaman," Awesome
","This was a great movie. Everything that a good movie needs. The cinematography was SUPERB. Nicole Kidman was awesome in her mother role. And Jason Momoa was indeed AQUAMAN. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Black Manta was a great pick. All of the characters were strong and whether good or bad, really pulled you into the movie-not one dull moment.",10,3,7,1 January 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Not sure how to feel...
","I liked the movie, but I agree with some of the other reviewers, it was very much hyped up, but I feel like someone let the air out of my balloon while I wasn't looking.First off, love Iron Man. Was really surprised that he is one of the Avengers that is sacrificed at the end. Is he really gone? Not sure...kinda thinking he did some mastermind stuff to live on in some capacity.And then they take Cap away. An old man now...(sheesh). I do understand that Chris didn't want to play this role anymore. It's been 8 years, but hey, I could have taken a few more. And in the comics, the mantle goes to Bucky to continue as Captain America. Well right now, Bucky is just hanging out to dry (as he has been lately).And although I see that they tried to throw some humor in there, why in the world did they make Thor a drunk and fat. Really????And why did they even put Danvers in there for? OK...she found Iron Man and brought him home and then destroys Thanos' ship only. I thought she was supposed to save the day. All the hoopla with building her up in Captain Marvel (which don't get me started as to how much of that movie didn't mesh with the comics).I don't know, but the whole fighting scene was a bit much. Some things just didn't make much sense. Why is Thanos so strong all of a sudden (with no stones)?And I just don't think that certain Avengers got their fair share of screen time and some received too much.And finally, there were just holes all over the place. I'm not sure where the MCU goes from here, but I'm here for it (that's for sure).",6,9,28,28 April 2019
Creed II," Creed I better
","While I liked this...there was something lacking or forced. I don't know if it was giving Creed a family and a baby in this or what. The drama was really in the Drago side. I won't switch my allegiance to Creed, but like I said something felt forced. Perhaps it was the chemistry between Creed and Bianca. It was off and amiss.I did enjoy the workout scenes in the desert and the fight sequences were definitely on point, but it is kinda unbelievable that Creed would actually be the real victor if this wasn't Hollywood. Drago had the height, weight, and skills to put Creed in the ground.For all of these reasons, I'm giving it 7 stars.",7,0,2,11 March 2019
