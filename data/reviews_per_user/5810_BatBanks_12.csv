Vertigo," The Worst Suspense Movie I Ever Seen
","This movie should not never remade in 10-20 years. It complete overrated and had bad acting. Hitchcock tale about obsession and fear. Jimmy Stewart plays a detective who forced to retire after his fear of height cause the death of a police officer. When an old friend asks him to follow his beautiful wife (Kim Novak) who obsessed about her great-grandmother. He end up fall for her and become obsession with her, after he believe he cause her death by suicide. This is Jimmy Stewart worst movie, Stewart is a good actor, but that was the wrong film he did and Kim Novak is no good either, I know she's the worst actress of the 50's and known for her pretty face. I gave it a thumb down.",5,5,12,18 November 2011
Batman Returns," Waste of Character and Plot in Batman
","Batman Returns has ridiculous plot and one unnecessary character. The movie could been better, they didn't show Michael Keaton that much and they portrayed the Penguin as a deformed psychopath while in the comic book and series he was just a criminal whose is a gentleman. Michelle Pfeiffer is a pretty actress, but she was miscast as Catwoman. She is portrayed as psychopath woman who runs around blowing up mall and beat people up while in the comic and series she was just a jewel thief. Like Batman ripped off his mask, really stupid and she get worked up with this. She is the unnecessary character that made this film not make any sense and dumb.",6,0,8,24 August 2011
Doctor Zhivago," Doctor Unfaithful
","Doctor Zhivago is about a Russian doctor-poet who marry his childhood sweetheart/adoptive sister but falls in love and pursing a lovely woman during World War I and the Russia Revolution.The film is too long and boring. There is no romance/chemistry between Omar Sharif and Julie Christie at all. There's no acting (soap opera-like acting instead). I never understood what Zhivago fall or see in Lara. Well I am not a fan of infidelity he cheating on his wife while she having their second child. They never explains what happen to Lara's family and Tonya, her father and their son. The movie tried to be the next Gone with the Wind but fails. Nothing can top that. The critics didn't like it (can you blame them), but the fans and Academy did like it. It not a good story at the begin. I didn't find the late Omar Sharif all that attractive in this he looks better in Funny Girl, that three years later. Julie Christie look really pretty in this movie. The movie had pretty cinematography and costume design. Watch careful and you see Omar Sharif only son as young Zhivago as a child at the begin of the film. Watch Lawrence of Arabia instead.",4,5,9,1 March 2016
Captain America: Civil War," It Should Be Called The Avengers: Civil War, Not Captain America
","This was the year (2016) of superheroes fighting themselves. The first half of the movie was slow it start to pick up around the middle of the story. The story lines remind me of DC Animated Movies and Justice League Unlimited first season. Three Marvel characters that do not appear in this one were Thor, Hulk, and Nick Fury which that surprising. They treating Tony Stark like he's the bad guy in this but he doing his job and all Cap (meaning Captain America) is doing's protect his friend Bucky now Winter Soldier. Who really steals the show is Tom Holland's Spider-Man (first actual teenager playing him) in his appearance he just as fun as Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man. The film is okay, but I like said the begin was mediocre but still entertain.",7,2,4,24 May 2017
Revolutionary Road," Two Leads are Miscast
","The movie is about young 1950s couple's dysfunctional marriage. When the wife masters a plan to move the family to Paris to save their marriage, careers, and unfulfilled dreams. When the husband commit infidelity, she also commit infidelity, her acting career is failure (because she can't act), and other issues that lead into tragedy.The movie is kind of like a play both leads are miscast. Kate Winslet can't act and is not right role. She and Leonardo DiCaprio have no chemistry. It's only because fans like their relationship in Titanic (in which neither have chemistry and can't act at the time). And the film is not so great so it a skip that film topic.",4,1,4,13 August 2014
Django Unchained," B-Movie Style Western
","Fun movie with spaghetti western/Blaxploitation and typical Quentin Tarantino film (over the top violence and humor). They original wanted Will Smith as Django, but Smith is not right for the role, the role was perfect fit for Jamie Foxx. Kerry Washington was pointless as Django's wife, she was more of damsel in distress. But really made the film was Christoph Waltz, Samuel L. Jackson, and Leonardo DiCaprio, you really know why Waltz won an Oscar for his performance because he was excellent in the movie and Samuel L. Jackson performance deserved more attention. Also there comic relief with Big Daddy (which the funniest and stupid scene you've ever seen), but the film show too many racist and disrespect scenes that will make everyone uncomfortable. The film's okay but not great.",7,0,2,15 November 2018
Frozen," Okay Disney film, but little Overrated
","Frozen is revamp/little bit piece of Hans Christian Anderson underrated tale, The Snow Queen. The story about two princess sisters Anna and her older sister, Elsa. Elsa has icy powers and accidental trapped the kingdom of Arendelle in eternal winter Now accused for sorceress, Elsa flee the kingdom so she never harm anybody. Anna teams up Kristoff to get her sister back and save their kingdom.The story is cute especially the silly snowman, Olaf. The song they keep playing 'Let Go' is overrated and sound terrible. If you read the original story of the Snow Queen; she was evil and cold and want everybody to love her she kidnap Kay because he doesn't believe in her, she was not misunderstood (so they should've kept her as she was). Even though I don't care for computer animation I prefer hands-made drawing (I'm 90's kid), Elsa and Anna are pretty, especially Elsa. Everybody compare this movie to The Lion King, but The Lion King still top. The movie is okay but it little overrated.",5,4,9,17 June 2014
Moulin Rouge!," Over-the-Top Musical
","Moulin Rouge is a musical comedy/romance/drama about a young British writer, Christian (Ewan McGregor) travel in France and fall in love with the star attraction cabaret/courtesan, Satine (Nicole Kidman). The love affair is doomed at the beginning because of two reasons: 1.) The duke who can finance improvements to Moulin Rouge by turned into a theater and he lust for Satine. 2.) Satine is dying.Everyone in the movie can not sing and ruins the classic songs from the 50's and the 80's. Nicole Kidman is miscast as the lead, she is neither sexy or pretty and her acting in this annoying why on earth did she get nominated for her performance. The scenes with her moaning is rip-off of When Harry Met Sally, it really show she's a lousy actress. Ewan McGregor and John Leguizamo are talented actors but they were wasted in the film. McGregor good looks and charms kept the film going.The acting is bad and over the top cartoonish performances and more up close of grotesque people working in Moulin Rouge. The characters are silly; Kidman's character is sick & dying, what bother me is why didn't she just tell McGregor's character that she's sick? The movie's extremely overrated and stupid.",4,0,2,29 October 2019
The Dark Knight," Better than Batman Begins
","Batman has return indeed; the Dark Knight is better than the first one. The movie left off with Gotham City not knowing if they trust Batman or not, He teams up with Harvey Dent and Commissioner Gordon to bring down Gotham City organized crime. A new villain come in Gotham he is known by The Joker (played by the late Heath Ledger) and psychopath and known what Batman thinks.The film is good, but overrated. The writers did research in both comic books and the animated series back in 1992. Unlike the sequel Batman Returns they had better villains and re-introduce The Joker is killed in the original first film. When they first announce Heath Ledger was going to played the Joker I thought he was going to be miscast and too young for the part but he did a good job (not Oscar-Worthing) but I still believes Jack Nicholson is the best Joker. They cast the right people for the characters especially Gary Oldman as Gordon but Christian Bale is still miscast as Batman, he can't act and Bruce Wayne suppose look like Gregory Peck handsome (Michael Keaton's still the best) and Maggie Gyllenhaal can't act either as the love interest (who replaced Katie Holmes role, she was too young for the part). It stills enjoyable film to watch and still a three star because it reminds me of the animated series.",9,1,4,18 October 2010
Alice in Wonderland," Alice has returned to Wonderland indeed
","This new adaption of Lewis Carroll classic children tale Alice in Wonderland is suppose to be a sequel to the two previous books. It has Alice now 19-year-old returning to the magical world of Wonderland. She discovers her true destiny to end the Red Queen's reign of terror once and for all. There's only one problem, Alice doesn't remember being in Wonderland as a child and thinks it all a dream.Johnny Depp teams up with friend/director Tim Burton and steals the show as the Mad Hatter. Me and my aunt's favorite scene is when Alice meets him and his fellow mad party friends. Helena Bonham Carter was perfect as the Red Queen. The once beautiful Anne Hathaway as the Red Queen sister the White Queen look like a vampire instead of a Queen. The Cheshire Cat is not shown that much in the film, but I love the way he acts. Newcomer Mia Wasikowska is miscast as Alice, she is too ugly, pale and can't act. Alice is suppose be cute. I still think they should have pick someone like Emma Watson or AnnaSophia Robb as Alice. This was one of the best Alice in Wonderland ever made. Tim Burton has a perfect plot for the story after all no one once to watch a story about a little girl wondering around meeting odd character.",7,0,2,18 October 2010
Inception," Sweet Dreams Are Made of This
","Inception is about a man who specializes stealing people ideas in their dream, but his career does him everything in his life that's real. His plan gets ruins by his psycho dead wife that he keep this secret from his team. A businessman hires him go to his rival mind about his company.The film is good and well-acted by Leonardo DiCaprio and other cast. But what ruins the team mission is Leo's psycho wife played Marion Cotillard; Cotillard performance is overrated, Michelle Williams did better job as his wife in his other film, Shutter Island (came out the same year and similar plot). She was pointless in the film. Ellen Page is good especially her scenes with DiCaprio (I wish she should've played Jane Eyre's 2011 film) Both DiCaprio performance in the same year really prove that he's a good actor now. I don't understand why everyone considered the movie was bad, but it not.",7,0,3,10 June 2014
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Interview with the Whining Vampire
","It about a vampire (Brad Pitt) tell a interviewer (Christian Slater, who replaced the late River Phoenix) about his immortal life from 18th-century New Orlean-modern day San Francisco. How he becoming a vampire after Lestat (Tom Cruise) give him the 'dark gift'. Louis's horrified by his blood-lust and whines about it. Lestat turn recently orphan little girl, Claudia (a young Kirsten Dunst) into a vampire to prevent Louis from leave him but he doesn't realize he made it worse...It get boring when it get to the middle of the movie. Everybody in the movie can't act (except for Kirsten Dunst. She the only one that could act she gave best performance as the vicious child vampire who will be forever a child.) Tom Cruise performance is over-the-top as the seductive and powerful Lestat. Louis is whiner; he doesn't like being a vampire (but he was not thinking because he was too upset about his wife death). Brad Pitt is the best looking vampire in this although his vampire make-up is frightening looking but he's still attractive. The movie has good Gothic themes with humor and dark fantasy. If the movie ever get reboot, next time cast better actors, please?",4,2,7,17 September 2013
