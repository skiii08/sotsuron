Casablanca," OUTSTANDING
","This is by far my favorite movie of all time.  It spins so many different tales that come full circle back to the main point of a love story. Starts and finishes strong, I like the struggle that Rick must choose between the woman that he loves and the Nazi's taking over the city of love.",10,1,1,18 September 2002
