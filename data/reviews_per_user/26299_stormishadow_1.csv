The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," It was all I expected it to be! :)
","So on Saturday I was able to watch this movie! To tell you the truth I enjoyed it very much! I have read the books and I found that the movie had a lot of things that I enjoyed from the book. Of course it has its slow dialog at times... but for those who read the book already know and should be aware of this. In this book and movie.... there really wasn't any fighting scenes so don't expect much action. The honeymoon scenes was funny, cute and they didn't show much so that was good :) I've read in other reviews that you might laugh in the most serious parts well there were some funny parts because of Jacobs's sarcasm... I laughed a lot in the honeymoon scene because of how they made it :P but other than that, for those Twilight readers and fansÂ…. I was very proud with the out come!! Oh and one more thing. Jacob and Renesmee imprinting isn't a 'Pedophile' like some reviews have mentioned. Obviously you aren't well informed or just not smart enough to understand. Like Jacob mentioned when people imprint its not like they just want to marry that person then have sex or whatever. No, its more of a I'll be your protector, your brother, your friend, anything. Well anyway... For those Twilight Fans I recommend you go and watch it.! I loved it :)",10,12,29,20 November 2011
