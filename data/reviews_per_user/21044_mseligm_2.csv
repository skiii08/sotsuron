Skyfall," Stuck together with sticky tape!
","I was disappointed with Skyfall due to the plot and overall inconsistency of the movie. There are so many factors that make me feel this way. Here are a few without giving too much away.1) Bond can't move out of the way when he knows an order has been given to shoot 2) Surviving a fall like that and then vanishing off the face of the earth, why?? are we watching a Bourne movie or have we lost creativity here? 3) Q is just terrible. The actor should stick to playing roles like in Cloud Atlas 4) No gadgets at all? 5) Super duper ex agent with amazing computer skills hacks into Mi6 systems because of a moronic act from the so called super intelligent Q.. OK whatever.. those who see the film will know what i mean.I am amazed that this got such a high rating like 8. Clearly IMDb is rigged and its not the first time i have seen errors with movie ratings on this site. Besides bashing the film i can say it was mildly entertaining to watch but definitely not the 8 as it has been given. i give it a 5/10.",5,8,18,1 January 2013
The Hunger Games," trailer is better than the movie!!! by far!
","terrible adaptation of a fantastic novel. This movie is probably one of the biggest let downs of 2012 so far. Not worth the ticket price, stay away is my advice.. An extremely predictable movie which takes away any fun from watching at the cinema. There were even people laughing at what was meant to be serious 'love' moments in the movie, including myself. It's amazing to see what marketing can do to hype. The only compliment i can give is that the trailer looks great!! Go and spend your money on something else that will actually add value to your life. You've been warned :-)",1,30,54,25 March 2012
