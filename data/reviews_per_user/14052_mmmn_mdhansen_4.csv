Blade Runner 2049," Even better than the original
","I'm a big fan of Blade Runner. It's not in my top 10, but definitely in my top 100. I was cautiously optimistic for this, but it completely blew me away. I don't think anybody but Denis Villeneuve could've pulled it off.It felt like a true sequel, and that is surprisingly hard to pull off. It maintains the spirit of the original, while expanding on the story and the characters without going overboard. I couldn't have hoped for or imagined anything better.",10,1,18,29 January 2019
Citizen Kane," How is this #1
","Honestly, the mere fact that this movie is ranked so high by so many people and organizations just proves that behind the greediness of Hollywood lies a smug bunch of people who consider themselves more artsy and intellectual than everyone else in America. Unless they grew up during the great depression, they didn't actually enjoy this movie and the only reason that they move it to the top of their list is because everybody else has and they think that by not having it up there others will see them as being less artistically advanced. This movie may have been great when only 5 movies were being made in Hollywood per year, but since then hundreds of movies have been whose quality far surpasses that of Citizen Kane.",4,5,12,1 August 2007
Cloverfield," Great Movie...HORRIBLE ENDING
","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.It was thrilling, scary, well made, full of pretty good acting. It kept me and everybody in the audience on the edges of our seats (literally) throughout the entire 1 1/2 hours.What bothered me about this movie and the reason that I gave it 5 stars instead of the 8 or 9 that it could have deserved...I have never seen a worse ending in my entire life. There is absolutely NO closure...It just ends.I'm not going to say anything specific about the movie because the mystery makes it better and I still believe that it is worth seeing in that it is extremely entertaining, I just think that it doesn't deserve he merit of a great movie because a believe that a movie should have a beginning a middle and an end...call me old fashioned but i don't think that a movie should stop in the middle.Go see it...you'll be entertained...just don't expect it to make in your top 500 list.",5,3,9,19 January 2008
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Good Spiderman movie. Terrible 2-D animation. WAY overrated.
","I honestly don't understand the hype. The movie was fine. My kids enjoyed it about as much as I did (I'm 35, they're 6, and we all love superhero movies). I really enjoyed the movie at times, and was bored at other times. The comedy was great and the plot was original/decent. For the first 30 minutes of the movie, I thought we were being shown the 3-D version. I looked around to see if people had the glasses on. The random guy next to me was doing the same, and he left to get glasses for him and his kids. He let me try them to prove to me that the animation was not in 3-D, but rather was just bad animation.Here are my guesses for why the ratings are so high:
1) Only really big fans of Spiderman, comic books, and/or cartoons have seen this movie, so the scores haven't been evened out by the average moviegoer.
2) Many reviewers saw it in 3-D, and the animation looks like it was designed solely for 3-D. If I felt like wasting my money, maybe I would've enjoyed it more.
3) Critics are mostly nerds, and the nerdy critics are the only ones who watched this. They're probably all the same critics who love the CW superhero shows.
4)I don't see how this is higher than a 7.5 on iMDB, and 50% on Rotten Tomatoes.",6,6,14,29 January 2019
