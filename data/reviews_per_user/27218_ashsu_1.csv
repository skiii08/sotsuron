Airlift," nailed it
","its one of the great movie to watch...some scenes really give you goosebumps.go to your nearby theater and do watch it as fast as you can.Akshay nailed the screen and so as Nimrit. I have become an Akshay Kumar fan in the recent years. From being Bollywood's favorite Khiladi in more ways than one, this person has matured as an actor. He brings that rare thing to the screen - persona. Nimrat Kaur does justice to her role. I would have liked a lot more layering in the expressions of this rather complex character, but that's just me. Joseph - who grows in stature from that first shot when Akshay Kumar is asking him how much moneys they have, to the end. Purab Kohli as Iqbal.. what can one say? He stands out, really, REALLY stands out, is all. You will have to see his performance to know what I mean. From the man who escorts the hero to a small gathering of friends in a supermarket, to the man who ensures an identity for a woman with an infant, and then looks the hero in the eye as he walks past, this man truly is an equal.",10,3,5,25 January 2016
