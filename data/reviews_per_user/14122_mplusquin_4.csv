Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Funny, nice but a bit overrated
","KBv2 is a nice movie, very well acting but in my opinion a comedy. Bit cornball and also long (and slow compared with v1). I believe it's more of a Tarantino hype then the movie is worthy. A lot of funny pointers too any move we ever might have seen, but also overdone. Very nice photography, very well instructed. I lack the kung fu capabilities of 'little Grasshopper'/Kwai Chang Kain David Carradine. My guess is they made a lot of money by spending as little as possible on locations, scenery and background. But why not if you can get away with it? As this is the part two of one movie I'm afraid that the whole thing is too long (4 hours) for a single line story, in which some impossibilities repeat to much, there could have been a bit more creative vision on these points. All together: a good film, bit overrated now, but it will also be a very nice part on the resume of Quintin over the years.",7,1,3,22 April 2004
Van Helsing," Good be overall nothing special
","Again, a good movie. But are good movies special nowadays? The story is actually very skinny. Gathered and ripped characters, no connection between these and I think sometimes to sought off for the younger ones. Van Helsing seems suddenly to be the 'left hand'of god, Gabriel. Does everybody fully understand that this is the archangel? Why did the screenwriter decide this? And when he did, why didn't he use it more? Now it's a almost useless decision. The whole film is carried by the effects, and it's seems to me it's made on exactly the same computer as the extraordinary League Of Gentlemen. I did miss the Gothic aspects very much, for this being a side step of the fantastic and ever inspiring Dracula story. All together I had a good time, over two hours (!!) and a good laugh as well. Some parts were on the border of being romantic or cornball, I choose for the best intention. Storywise it definitly could have been made better, but then again, it could have been done worse as well. See it for yourself, as it is worthwhile.",7,0,0,4 May 2004

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," We're spoiled!
","With a lot of enthusiasm I start writing this comment. Potter 3 is again a superior release, with all the ingredients needed. The story continues in a sturdy manner, the characters grow, as the actors do as well. And I notice that we as an audience are spoiled to the bone. Spoiled by the overwhelming specials effects as we've seen in 1 and 2, now we almost would take them for granted in this third edition. The whole surrounding in which the story takes place seems so natural and normal, what is at the same time a huge compliment to the makes of this picture, as they can convince us in believing the craftsmanship of special effects.  The story, just as the book, brings the viewer to a new dimension in the saga. And everything in this story matches as a glove, and keeps the viewer on the edge of his seat till the end. Also the new but familiar faces in the cast are a nice surprise, and very well fitted in. This line of movies is a quality standard on itself and the makers manage to keep it high in a refreshing manner.Go see it for yourself!",Null,0,0,3 June 2004
