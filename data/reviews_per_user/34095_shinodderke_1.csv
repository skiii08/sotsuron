Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," VERY AWFUL!
","Only little children can like this movie, because I can't imagine that a grown-up with enough intelligence could ever tolerate the stupidity of this film. Well, if you can see this movie free of charge and you have absolutely nothing important to do, then you can do it. But don't pay and don't sacrifice your valuable time for such an idiot movie",1,18,36,3 November 1999
