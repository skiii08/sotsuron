First Man," Shake it up baby
","A relative bought this film on a pay-per-view while I was visiting because she knew I was a space flight junky. (Aerospace career engineer at McDonnell-Douglas, Rockwell, JPL, and Lockheed Martin).The initial sequence was well done and a valid use of shaky cam. But when the camera just kept on shaking I knew I was in trouble. I utterly despise shaky cam and will not watch a film that uses it.I've gotten into the habit of checking in this forum before renting or attending a film to see if this execrable method is used. Went as long as I could before apologizing and....well....bailing out.In agreement with many reviewers here on what I did see -- slow moving and somewhat listless, with way too many extreme close-ups.",3,2,4,15 April 2019
