3:10 to Yuma," Instant Classic
","This movie is destined to be a classic. I don't watch movies more then once usually. Unless I am lying on the couch with the plague watching whatever comes across the TV anyway. And I have watched this movie at least 5-6 times over the last two years. As a young 29 year old male I must say I was more then intrigued with the outlaw Ben Wade, simply a brilliant character brilliantly played by crowe. But what really got me is the pure guts of Dan Evans, the father, played by bale. I would recommend this movie to anyone as I think this movie has something for everyone in it. My 9 year old loves it as much as I do if that means anything.",10,2,4,15 April 2009
