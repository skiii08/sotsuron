The Devil's Advocate," One of my all time favorites
","In my opinion,this is one of the best movies of all time. I'm shocked that it has no Oscar nominations. Pacino definitely deserves one for almost every movie he was in. But it won Saturn award for the best horror... really?! Horror?! In which universe is this movie a horror?! It's drama, it may pass for thriller or mystery, but to say it's horror is complete nonsense. I suppose everyone saw this movie, but to those who saw it just once I recommend watching it again, because this movie is full of ingenious lines that in first watching mostly pass unnoticed, because without knowing how movie ends they seem casual and irrelevant, and they're not. In spite of the fact that the main role is entrusted to Keanu Reeves, the story and other actors are so strong that the film is a pure10/10",10,2,2,30 January 2018
The Mask," Cult comedy
","Cameron Diaz debut and movie that made Jim Carrey superstar. Cult comedy and one of favorite movies in my youth. For its time it had spectacular special effects and it's one of biggest blockbusters of 90's, cause with 20 million budget it earned over 350 million. From today's perspective it's not quite a masterpiece, but it is pretty much fun and dear memory.7,5/10",7,1,1,29 September 2017
Saturday Night Fever," 'I'm goin' nowhere, somebody help me.'
","This cult disco movie, which made Travolta a star, talks about growing up in the working class and attempts to escape from mediocrity and pointlessness of everyday life, even if only on a Saturday night. The main character finds sanctuary in a discotheque, where he's undisputed king of the dance floor. Through film permeate many of the problems typical of the lower middle class, as well as disturbed relations between the sexes that are particularly noticeable in this environment. Although music and dance occupy a large part of the film, the 'Saturday Night Fever' exudes the atmosphere of hopelessness. Travolta gave an excellent performance, and the soundtrack is one of the best ever, but the overall impression is relatively weak. The film is good, but not nearly up to its reputation.7/10",7,1,3,18 September 2018
The Lobster," Speechless...
","I watched this two-hour movie without pause, as hypnotized, and when it ended I was left staring at the ending credits and then the black screen for a few more minutes. I had no idea what to write, so I went to see what others have commented. Rare are films that divide the audience like this. There are no middle grades, I didn't see any fives, sixes or sevens. All the reviews I saw either spit on it, rating it one or two, or praise it and give it nines and tens. I think it is both an exaggeration, but one thing is certain - the film achieved the goal that is shared by all the movies, and that is to make a strong impression.In the dystopian future, it is not allowed to be single. Singles are arrested and taken into a remote hotel, where they have 45 days to pair up or otherwise they'll be transformed into an animal of their own choice. A lot of them escape to the nearby forest and the hotel residents hunt them and for every one caught hunter gets an extra day at the hotel. The film shows both sides of the coin, life in the hotel and life in the forest. It is totally weird, irrational, morbid and mesmerizingly disturbing, yet again, it's not tiring to watch. The cast is very good and Yorgos Lanthimos definitely hooked me to see the rest of his movies.8/10In case you didn't notice, except for the main character and his two 'best friends', there are no names mentioned in the entire movie. Even the names of the two leading female characters are left unknown.",8,0,3,13 December 2018
The Avengers," 'Cognitive recalibration - I hit you really hard on the head'
","Action, action, action, effects, effects, effects, action, effects, effects, action, action, effects... I don't know, maybe I should give up on superhero movies, or maybe Marvel could put a little effort into giving them some meaning. Two and a half hours of stunning effects and breathtaking action, great acting and directing, interesting characters, a few witty remarks, but all together is kind of vain and pointless. The plot didn't engage me, I didn't relate to the characters and I couldn't care less what will happen to them. There was no depth or point. This is simply a couple of hours of superficial fun for those who have fun shutting their brains out. I love the effects and the action and the adrenaline too, but that's not enough for me. I need the film to have a strong story and depth. If I can't have both, I'll always pick a poorly filmed good story rather than superbly made nonsense. Still, I have to admit that it is really powerfully filmed and, within the genre, I cannot go below8/10",8,1,1,31 July 2019
Blade Runner 2049," Sequel or Remake
","Blade Runner 2049 is direct sequel to original from 1982, by story, picture and sound. Although technically sequel of the original story, essentially it is remake of Blade Runner's atmosphere and soul. It mimics the original so skillfully that the gap of 35 years disappears. It answers some questions that first film had left undefined, and deepens the others. Still, it's not quite It. In 1982 Blade Runner was something new, original, interesting and thought provoking. In the meantime a lot of films about artificial intelligence have been made, and 35 years later the Blade Runner 2049 does not bring anything new. Some things were taken from the original, in many others I recognized the similarities with 'AI', 'Her', 'The Fifth Element' ... Simply, however good it is, all it shows has already been seen, and therefore it does not leave a particularly strong impression. I liked it, but personally I experienced it more like a remake than a new movie. Great, but inferior to the original.8,5/10P.S. Strictly subjective, I think it's unnecessarily too long and, although the acting is excellent, I do not like the choice of actors. Simply, most of them do not fit right into the story, especially Jared Leto, which in my opinion is a total failure for the role.",8,1,8,18 February 2018
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Kill Bill: Vol. 1 & 2
","At the time 'Kill Bill' came out, movies were a totally minor thing in my life. I watched them relatively often, but I did not pay any attention to 'details'. I had no idea who the director was, and the question is whether I knew at all what the director was. Besides Uma Thurman, I think I never heard of other actors back then. I rated movies on a very simple scale - whether it's fun or not. This one was fun for a ten. Fifteen years and several thousand films later, I look at movies from a completely different angle and 'fun' is no longer at the top of the criteria that distinguish good movies from bad ones. Now I analyze them in more detail and I still haven't found any flaws in this one.It could be said that Quentin Tarantino's talent is a gift from God, but I think it's far more likely that he sold his soul to the Devil. The lowest rating I have ever given to one of his films is nine, and I'm not a 'fanboy'. 'Kill Bill' is an action thriller, and for me action films are the lowest form of the seventh art. But Tarantino's ability to create an action movie which is also an art film is fascinating. The story is crazy and great, but the least important. Camera work, fight choreography, use of color and sound and feeling for details make this film a masterpiece of cinema. The cast is more than good, and Tarantino manages to get the most out of them. I doubt that any of these actors have ever given a better performance than in this movie. And, of course, music! Music is very diverse, totally unexpected, often even unsuitable for the scenes it follows, yet again in such a perfect (dis)harmony with the divine scenery and crazy choreography, that it all leaves the viewer breathless. For movies like this one even ten is depreciation.10/10",10,3,4,26 May 2018
Black Swan," Overrated
","Natalie did deserve her Oscar, but the movie overall is extremely boring. The first hour is agonizing, and then, after some 65 minutes, something finally begins to happen and the finale is great. But I was at the edge of giving up ten times and missing that good ending, because it takes real effort to go through the first hour.Natalie: 9/10

Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Weakest link, but still great
","Fourth movie in Pirates franchise is bit below level of its prequels, but that does not mean it's bad, it's just bit less great. Story is linear this time, there's less plot and twists than before, and Penelope does not fit in this world so good in my opinion. But Jack Sparrow is Jack Sparrow, movie is visually beautiful and followed by music that crawls under my skin deeper and deeper with every sequel, becoming closer to be my favorite soundtrack ever.

Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Watchable, but better skip it...
","I'm sitting in front of an open post for about 10 minutes not knowing what to think, let alone write. It left me speechless for a while. In fact, not movie itself, but hype it caused when it was released. For months I was listening about it, 'It's hilarious. It's offensive. It's actually pretty smart as well', its screenplay was even nominated for Oscar... I was skeptical, but I would lie if I said I had no expectations. I expected it not to be as good as it was popular, but I really didn't expect complete crap. Out of the attributes mentioned above, it is only offensive. Don't get me wrong, I'm not at all against offensiveness. Quite opposite, I'm against today's aggressive political correctness and offensiveness is one of my favorite techniques in achieving humor. But if we are going to be offensive let's do it in the most hilarious way possible. If it's not funny then it's just offensive and just offensive is ugly. This movie offends not only Kazakhstan and Americans, this movie offends our intelligence. I admit, in preadolescence childhood I might find it quite entertaining, but as an adult... If they were going for 'it's so bad that it's good' type of movie then I could forgive their failure cause that kind of movie is really hard to do right, but if they were just going for good comedy then I really have no idea what to say...4/10",4,2,3,11 August 2017
Alien 3," Underrated
","'For within each seed, there is a promise of a flower. And within each death, no matter how small, there's always a new life. A new beginning. Amen.'I cannot find any positive reviews for this movie. Rated 6 and all reviews put it in the worst movies ever made. I liked it very much. It is a bit weaker than Aliens, but to me, it is better than the first one.8/10",8,2,4,12 March 2017
Gremlins," Lovable family horror comedy
","One of my favorite childhood movies. Easy going horror-comedy, one of the very few that succeeds in mixing those two genres and not ending up as complete crap. The story is smart and nicely told, with good acting and directing. It's entertaining and slightly scary, especially if you are a kid. And Gizmo is one of the cutest things ever shown on the big screen. True family movie from the '80s.7/10",7,1,3,8 November 2016
The Incredible Hulk," Ang Lee, come back, everything's forgiven
","Edward Norton and Tim Roth are good as always. And that's about everything that's worth in this movie. There's no drama, no suspense and tension, no mystery or thrilling moments, no humor at all (which is surprising for Marvel), characters are bland and do not cause a bit of empathy... Stupid and boring action crap with lousy CGI. If you think that 2003 'Hulk' was bad, you should probably skip this one.4,5/10",4,0,4,30 August 2018
Requiem for a Dream," 'In the end it's all nice'
","When I first saw 'Requiem for a Dream' I watched it with a company, so I've probably seen it in its entirety, but, since I was extremely bored, ask God where my thoughts were. A couple of years later I reprised it and it was so boring that I gave up before the end. When one of the movie groups on Facebook became like second home to me, I noticed that this film is quite popular among its members and that many even rank it among the favorite films, so I decided to give it one more chance. It bored me to the extent that I was not able to analyze it, and I only assessed my subjective impression by rating it three out of ten. This caused general bashing after yours truly. For this reason, for the first time in my life, I did not just reprise, but for the fourth time I watched a film that I did not like. This time I was mentally prepared to be fully focused from start to finish and be as objective as possible.I must admit that the movie is visually really masterfully filmed. It contains a lot of unforgettable scenes that are, each for itself, striking artwork of photography. The camera work, the use of colors, editing and music perfectly conjures up the psychic and emotional states of the characters and effectively insert the viewer into it. The acting is flawless, and particularly strong impression leaves Ellen Burstyn, who deservedly picked up a bunch of awards and nominations. Still, despite all this, I simply do not like 'Requiem'. I don't enjoy it, it's boring to me, and despite all efforts, I just couldn't force myself to watch it whole at once. I have often paused, checking how much is left to the end, and dragged it through the entire day. Although I can not disprove its artistic value or essential power, I simply can not stand this film and I'm through with it once and for all.8/10 (subjectively, it's still 3/10)",8,0,1,13 March 2019
Your Name.," One of the best animated movies I have ever seen
","Every few days, a girl from a small Japan town wakes up in the body of a Tokyo boy, and soon realizes that at the same time he takes over hers. On these occasions, they have to live each other's day, trying not to cause problems to each other. They begin to find ways to communicate with each other to make all this easier to work out. What they have yet to understand is that the situation is much more complicated than it first appears, and that on two of them depends survival of many people. I can not go deeper into the story to avoid spoilers, but believe me, you do not want to miss this movie. I really do not like anime, but this time I'm thrilled.9,5/10",9,3,4,20 April 2018

Sucker Punch," My new favorite :D
","I really want to rate this movie ten out of ten although I know it definitely doesn't deserve it. But I wanna... For quite some time I was thinking how to write smart and competent review and I've got nothing so far. I can not hook you by short summary without spoiler risks. To abstract some deep thoughtful philosophy out of it I really don't want to even try. Even if there are some I didn't notice them. This movie is simply pure fun of epic proportions. There are some artistic cadres, trippy weird amazing and jaw dropping mindfaks, there's drama and pathetic, there's action and CGI intemperance, sanatorium and whorehouse, little bit of Kill Bill and a bit of Hobbit, alternative history, train hijacking, samurai and trench battles against Germans, incompatible epochs mixed in same scenes, there's everything and everything is awesome. To lure mail audience, there's bunch of hot girls in sexy battle outfits, armed to teeth with swords and machine guns, who, in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Charlie's Angels and Matrix style, jump out of WWII airplane on running trains and medieval castles to butcher and riddle everything from people to zombies, robots, orcs, and eventually dragons. Complete madness. Zack Snyder is the king.I do not like Emily Browning in leading role (my only objection to this movie), but Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone and divine Carla Gugino nailed it with both performances and looks.9/10",9,3,6,30 October 2017
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," 'No measure of time with you will be long enough. But we'll start with forever.'
","And so for two hours ... The love triangle, the emotional-moral dilemma of a misunderstood teenage girl, everything that most of us experience in our youth, but which we cannot relate to because of the lame scenario and acting and the complete lack of any sympathy for the non-charismatic actors of this story. Even inter-species sex they have failed to utilize to spice up this pathetic lemonade a little and make it at least acceptable, if not interesting. Unlike the previous parts, this one does not even have action scenes that somewhat helped me not to fall asleep.5/10",5,0,1,4 April 2020

A little stronger rating because of Chloë Grace Moretz, who was the reason I saw it in the first place.7/10",7,1,1,9 March 2020

","Unlike the first one, which had great characterization, good dialogues, and witty remarks, and the second one that had Scarlett Johansson and AC/DC, this one is just a shallow action.

","When we talk about September 11, we usually refer to the World Trade Center and discuss the conspiracy theories and who is, in fact, responsible for this tragedy. Until this film, I never heard anyone mention passengers of abducted planes, and no matter what really happened, these people do not deserve to be forgotten. This film took care of it. The story is told from the perspective of the passengers of the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania, passengers who realized what was happening and took matters into their own hands, sacrificing their lives for a greater good. True, their fates were already sealed, since the abduction was a suicide mission, but it does not diminish the courage of people who have decided to leave this world as heroes, not as victims. With all due respect to them, I did not particularly like the film.7/10",7,0,1,26 January 2019
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," One of my favorite childhood memories
","I was very small when I saw this movie for the first time and, believe it or not, E.T. was pretty much scary to me. Because of that I was refusing to watch it again for years. But when I finally did, it was experience one never forgets. And even now, decades later, this movie evokes deep emotions and even makes me cry. It may be simple and technically outdated, but its essence has eternal value. 'E.T.' is that kind of movie that should definitely be watched from time to time and for which you are never too old.9/10",9,2,3,30 October 2018
Casablanca," Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she walks into mine
","This movie was nominated for eight Academy Awards, and it won three - Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay. On every list I ever encountered it is placed very high, often in the top ten. I have seen it several times and I still don't understand why. The movie is good and I love it, but if it were to win any Oscars than that Oscar should have gone into the hands of legendary Humphrey Bogart, one of the best actors of all time, because, in my opinion, Bogart is what made this film stand out above the average.7/10",7,0,1,13 November 2018
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Amazing
","Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter... who could be drawn to a theater by this title?! I thought it must be either parody or some low-budget crap and I had no intention to watch it at all. Yet, curiosity prevailed. I decided to take a look at every 15 minutes or so, just to get a basic idea of what it looks like. I could expect anything from this movie, but I could not possibly expect it to be any good. And not only it is good, it is great.The story is some kind of alternative history. It follows the life of Abraham Lincoln from early childhood to tragic death, but pervades his whole biography with vampires. It goes so far to claim vampires to be part of the cause of slavery in America and Civil War to be a war of human North against vampire-ruled South. It also gives a very interesting explanation of battle for Gettysburg. But I'll stop here to avoid serious spoilers. Interesting, but not complicated. It has elements of drama, horror, romance, western, supernatural, historical, biographical and action movie. Intelligent and well written and packed dialogues with some humor relief. Choice and performances of the actors are great, good directing and soundtrack, high-level production and special effects that are literally breathtaking in some scenes, especially those that combine western and Matrix style.Overall, I loved it.9/10",9,1,1,29 August 2017
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," 'I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.'
","The animated rabbit is accused of killing a man and he is to be punished by 'deleting' sentence. His beautiful animated wife and a human private detective are trying to solve this case and save the rabbit and the whole animated world from destruction.For me, this noir-mystery-comedy-thriller to this day remains the best movie that combines live action and animated film. I saw it countless times, never found a flaw, and I could count the qualities until the day after tomorrow. The story is simple but well-written, the combination of the noir atmosphere and the atmosphere of short cartoons is captivating, and one-liners are hilarious. This is the only film in which Disney and Warner characters appear together on the screen, and there are also several characters from other studios. The film has several parallels to 'Chinatown' and 'Back to the Future', and it parodies or pays homage to many more iconic movies and characters. It is full of awesome details that you have no chance to notice all during just one viewing, and for some it is necessary to watch the movie in slow motion because they are put in single frames.What fascinates me most about this movie is that computer animation wasn't used at all. Everything was done old-school and 326 animators hand-drawn over a million drawings, of which nearly one hundred thousand frames were used in the movie. With 70 million dollars invested, this is the most expensive film of the 80's. It had six Academy Awards nominations, out of which it won three. I must also mention the excellent music by Alan Silvestri (Fandango, Cat's Eye, Back to the Future franchise, Predator, Young Guns II, The Bodyguard, Judgment Night, Forrest Gump, Judge Dredd, Identity, Van Helsing, Night at the Museum, Captain America, The Avengers).I recommend this movie to everyone, and if you end up amazed like me, you can find tons of interesting trivia online.

","In my opinion, this movie is way overrated, as well as most of the Monty Python's 'masterpieces'. I rated it seven out of ten, meaning it is slightly above average. But the song from the film is the truest song ever recorded. It may sound like a clichÃ©, but I want this song at my funeral, because it has the incredible ability to brighten even the darkest moments. I consider this song the most valuable legacy of Monty Python.The movie: 7/10

Mulan," Different kind of Disney Princess
","In a Chinese family with no male children, daughter disguises herself as a male and goes to war against Huns instead of her elderly father. Hilarious Eddie Murphy lends his voice to her sidekick, a clumsy little red dragon. The story is interesting, with lots of Disney humor, but also a good message. Essentially, this is 'coming of age' and 'women empowerment' drama, but shown in a typical Disney way, to the extent that even this girl warrior can be classified among the Disney Princesses. I had the impression that someone forced them to make a 'women empowerment' movie, and then they did their best to disguise it as much as possible. I know that Disney movies are primarily intended for children, but still I think they banalized it too much. Also, I did not like the animation, but the music is excellent. Overall, a pretty good movie and a big step out of the comfort zone for Disney.7,5/10",7,0,0,6 November 2018

","Feature film debut by irritating Mike Myers is a comedy/parody full of wasted pop culture references and spoofs. From moment to moment I was recognizing piles of them whose potential to be hilarious was destroyed by an unbelievable lack of wittiness and charisma. The movie is too stupid for a quality humor comedy, and not stupid enough for an 'it's so bad it's good' movie. And for a comedy, it's incredibly boring. It seems to me like they tried to cling to the success of 'Bill and Ted.' The only good thing about this movie is the music, and the only scene I laughed at was the one with Alice Cooper.4/10",4,0,2,6 January 2020
Fight Club," Chuck Palahniuk... even if it is not good it must be fun :D
","I wouldn't align it with all-time masterpieces, but it definitely is a great movie. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton nailed the lead character, but from them, I didn't expect anything less. Meat Loaf additionally spiced winning combination. But my biggest surprise was that movie was based on Chuck Palahniuk novel. Although I saw it many times, that 'detail' never caught my eye. Chuck is completely nutz, but the movie did not indicate his style to me. Now I definitely have to read the book. The movie itself is fast, entertaining and with good twists, although the main twist is somewhat predictable if you are watching the movie carefully enough. If there is anyone who didn't see it so far, you should correct that mistake urgently, and for others, it won't harm you to refresh your memory, there are always new details you missed before.8,5/10",8,0,2,18 January 2017
Train to Busan," Good but overrated
","When I sit to watch zombie movie I expect horror, action, maybe even comedy, I expect B production and certain level of frivolity. Instead, Train to Busan brings A production and very serious drama. Essentially, this is not a zombie movie. This is movie about human relations and what they become in state of panic. Story that is seen many times before, but it's usually placed in war or natural disaster surrounding, while here they placed it in zombie apocalypse. This is not original story, this is just somewhat original mash-up of pretty much outworn clichés. Mash-up of disaster drama and zombie apocalypse we already have in Walking Dead. Walking Dead + Snowpiercer = Train to Busan. So, it's definitely not original. Further, action part of the story is painfully dumb. again we have bunch of people acting stupid and illogical in order to stretch movie to two hours. Most obvious example are survivors piercing through wagons crowded with zombies. In every new wagon they find different way to get from back to front door, risking their lives again and again. The only goal of those inventive new solutions is to fill half of the movie with thrilling action, while there is simple, obvious and safe solution put aside as it does not exist. Simply tell driver to stop the train in next tunnel (cause zombies attack only people they clearly see), then leave the train through door, walk outside the train to desired wagon, enter it and journey can be continued. Logical, practical, safe, but also a scene that would last just a few minutes and deprived us of the most exciting part of the movie. Stupidity and illogicality in service of agony prolongation is something we are used to in most of horror movies, but in serious drama it simply doesn't hold. Technically and visually it's well done and personal drama is deep and strong, but overall this is unoriginal movie with stupid plot and bunch of redundant action. And it does not have even H of horror.6,5/10",7,1,4,23 November 2017
Citizen Kane," Rosebud
","'There's only one person in the world who's going to decide what I'm going to do and that's me.'When I first watched this movie, I barely made it to the end. Superb photography, direction, editing, music, a strong atmosphere, excellent study of personality ... and boring. For some reason, it was unbearably boring to me, and it completely sidelined all qualities. Whoever I told I didn't like the movie considered me a fool, and for years I couldn't bring myself to give it (or myself) a second chance. I made the same mistake with Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey'. After decades of quitting halfway through, when I finally watched it in its entirety, I came out of the theater thrilled. It motivated me to re-watch some more cult classics that I hastily wrote off. 'Citizen Kane' didn't have nearly as strong an effect on me as 'A Space Odyssey,' but this time I saw it through without yawning and it left a much better impression than before. The objective qualities that make it a timeless masterpiece are undeniable, and now that I've read a bit about the film, I'm additionally impressed by some amazing facts. This is a Chaplin-like achievement for Orson Welles. He co-wrote, directed, starred and produced it at just 25, personally picking up the Academy Award for screenplay and nominations for directing (and this was his feature film directorial debut) and leading role, as well as 6 other nominations for the film, including the Best Picture. He was the first-ever to be nominated for the directing and leading role for the same movie. Movies 'Stagecoach' (1939) and 'Rebecca' (1940) had a major impact on Welles and many similarities in the story, set design, and shooting techniques can be seen in this film. There is a lot more interesting information that I read before I re-watched the film and that helped me to see it in a whole new light. Who knows, maybe after another viewing, it could go up to ten, but for now8,5/10",8,0,0,26 December 2019

","I do not feel competent to evaluate the 1915 film. I love old movies and I watched hundreds, but for the assessment of the film it is necessary to look at things from the perspective of its time, and this one is too far for my abilities.

","I appreciate Tarantino very much, but something like this I could not expect. He gathered fantastic group of actors who all overcame themselves, and such great competition Christoph Waltz easily stole the movie. I have absolutely no objections to it.

Underworld," Underworld Franchise (2003-2016)
","Still a better love story than Twilight :DSet (predominantly) in the present day, this fantasy franchise tells us of a centuries-old war between vampires and werewolves. We follow the story from the perspective of Selene (Kate Beckinsale), one of the greatest vampire warriors, who leads the werewolf hunt. When she meets Michael (Scott Speedman), a man who is persecuted by werewolves for a mysterious reason, her life and worldviews change drastically. This saga has quite a well-crafted story and characterization, though as the franchise goes on, the quality of the story declines to eventually turn into a shallow action. The acting, the camera, the directing, the effects, the music ... it's all pretty well done, but nothing spectacular.Underworld (2003)The first film introduces us to the dark world of vampires and werewolves, which secretly coexists with ours. While vampires are a well-organized society with a powerful army, werewolves are a wild unleashed horde that is gradually exterminated by vampires. And then emerges a leader capable of uniting werewolves, as well as a man capable of uniting the features of both races in one hybrid being. A good thriller with a story that will intrigue you, and with just the right amount of romance and well-directed action.7/10Underworld: Evolution (2006)'Evolution' continues directly to the first movie and now Selene and Michael are trying to break into the history and secrets of both races, in a desperate attempt to bring the centuries-old war to an end. A worthy sequel in the same manner and quality as the first film.7/10Underworld: Rise of the Lycans (2009)'Rise of the Lycans' is an 'origins story' and takes us into the Middle Ages. Vampires were aristocracy, and werewolves were their slaves, until the young werewolf Lucian rose into a leader who led his race in the struggle for liberation, thus beginning a centuries-old war between the two races. The franchise still holds a level.7/10Underworld: Awakening (2012)Humans discover the existence of vampires and werewolves and decide to exterminate them. Michael and Selene are hit while fighting humans and she wakes up twelve years later, not knowing what happened to Michael. She now has a twelve-year-old daughter, the first natural-born hybrid, who she must protect from Lycans that want to take advantage of her in their fight for dominance.The fourth film is slightly weaker than its predecessors. The action continues in the same manner, but the story is underdeveloped. I was under the impression that I was watching a long movie trailer, not the movie itself. But basically, I liked it.6,5/10Underworld: Blood Wars (2016)The latest installment in the 'Underworld' franchise is by far the worst, but not redundant. 'Blood Wars' rounds off this saga, but it does a rather lousy job, and the movie is reduced to eighty minutes of shallow action and two-dimensional characters that are there just to keep the story from staying unfinished. I don't want to recommend it, but again, you have to see it if you wish to know how the story ends.5/10",7,1,1,14 December 2019

Alien: Resurrection," Terribly underrated
","This movie is terribly underrated. It is a common opinion that 'Resurrection' buried 'Alien' franchise, but I really cannot see any reasons for it. The movie has a different approach than its prequels, but in 20 years movie industry changed so much and it would be sad if it was the same. Honestly, although I think it is slightly worse than two previous sequels, I still prefer it to the original 'Alien'.7,5/10",7,10,17,12 April 2017

","I wanted to see this since it was in the theaters 20 years ago, but somehow it never came to the table. I missed it in theaters, then I did not have VCR, then VHS became obsolete but I did not have internet till 2010... and so on till today. I was really dead set: a darkened room, good sound, snacks, all in order and... complete disappointment. Don't get me wrong, this movie is far from bad: excellent cast, interesting premise, and the baton in the hands of Terry Gilliam... But precisely because of the great names, the incredible hype in the nineties, and probably because of 20 years of waiting to finally see it, my expectations were very high and the film did not nearly satisfy them.6/10",6,2,8,21 March 2017
Shaun of the Dead," Golden middle
","I'm reading reviews and trying to find golden middle with no success. Audience considers this movie either the best or the worst British movie of the year. British have an unusual and for the rest of us often incomprehensible sense of humor. If you're used to Hollywood this probably won't entertain you. I suppose that most of the lowest ratings came from USA. At the other hand, I think this movie is overrated and that most of the tens, that pulled it to an average of eight, came largely from Britain. From my point of view, this is solid movie for one watching. I wouldn't call it a comedy. It is horror adventure sprinkled with lots of humor, British humor that tries not to be too British, but to adapt to the wider audience. And in that attempt lies it's biggest issue. Also, it is very difficult to mix genres, especially if there's too many. Although this movie somewhat succeeds in that attempt it didn't quite shine. Still, we have to acknowledge this brave attempt to make something unusual. All together, if you're not a fan of recent British film don't even give it a try, but if you are able to slip into British state of mind I think you'll enjoy this flick. I surely did.7/10",7,0,1,12 January 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Fairytale for all ages :D
","This one is maybe even better than first one. Good plot, great acting and directing and fantastic visual effects. It lacks some of the 'soul' first one had, but it's still a sequel and it's bound to repeat itself and lose some soul on lack of originality. But whatever it loses on originality, it is more than covered by quality in every aspect.When I was watching the first one, unfortunately I did not pay attention on music. This time music hypnotized me. It is so good that I even watched complete ending credits not being able to interrupt music that follows it. Movie sound fantastic.And of course, Johnny Depp, the only man who could possibly pull off Jack Sparrow, one of the best actors of our time.",8,0,1,9 October 2016
Rocky V," Refreshing change
","He finally gave up on four times repeated pattern and made a completely different story. This is not the story of a boxer who has to fight a bigger and bigger opponent in every sequel anymore, this is an emotional drama of a man who started from nothing, reached the stars and hit the bottom once again. A movie about being able to distinguish true values in life from current goals that blur the mind. The movie is not excellent in any aspect, but the story is the most interesting so far. Rocky's son is portrayed by Stallone's son, which gives this father-son relationship more credibility. Music is not bad, but it cannot be compared with prequels, except for fantastic 'The Measure of a Man' by Alan Menken, performed by Elton John. Definitely worth watching.7,5/10",7,3,3,22 January 2017

Beauty and the Beast," Simplified but beautiful
","This movie is an adaptation of the story from mid 18th century written by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont. The original story is completely different and I prefer it to Disney's version, but I understand why did they have to take a totally different approach and I admit that the result is amazing. Still, I recommend you to read the original text because it will shine a new light on the story and give you insight in its depth and true meaning. Disney's movie is meaningful, but it's mostly just a fairy- tale, while the original has a much heavier background. This is the very first animated movie nominated for an Academy Award for the best picture. It didn't win it, but it won two other Oscars, for the original score and the title song.8,5/10",8,0,0,4 May 2017
Public Enemies," Soulless
","Chicago, thirties of the last century. John Dillinger and the crew rob banks and with high-speed cars flee across state borders, escaping the police. The FBI is in its infancy and Hoover wants to build a reputation by catching Dillinger, a state enemy number one. Story is realistic, almost like documentary. Action scenes are well shot and from a technical standpoint film has no flaws. But, although it definitely isn't boring, it failed to pull me in. I was not tied to the characters, I wasn't rooting for either side, nor did I care about their fates. Johnny Depp, Christian Bale, Marion Cotillard, Jason Clarke, Stephen Graham and many other big names guarantee that trouble certainly doesn't lie in acting, but screenplay didn't left room for characterization. Characters are one-dimensional. Criminal is just a criminal, cop is just a cop, there's no background stories, no diverting from main course of the movie, no inner struggles, no emotions or depth. Just black and white and straight forward, like TV news. Though, here and there they inserted a couple of emotional moments, I guess in attempt to breathe some soul into the movie, but they only achieved needless pathetic that simply doesn't fit with the rest of it. Technically excellent film, but not essentially powerful.7/10",7,0,0,15 January 2018
Madagascar," 'I'm ten years old. My life is half over and I don't even know if I'm black with white stripes or white with black stripes!'
","The zebra got tired of living in the New York Zoo and decided to run away and try his hand at life in the wild. His best friend, a spoiled and egocentric lion, a protective hippopotamus and a hypochondriac giraffe embark on a rescue mission, and by a combination of unfortunate circumstances, they all end up in Madagascar, where their true natures come to the fore, and friendship must resist animal instincts and struggle for survival.This already cult animated comedy brings a lot of interesting situations and fun or even hilarious characters. The cast is great, and the performances of Chris Rock in the role of the zebra Marty and Sacha Baron Cohen in the role of the lemur king are unforgettable. And there are of course the awesome penguins who also have their own spin-off series and movie. It is not a masterpiece, but it is a great choice when you want to relax and smile, simple and colorful enough for the youngest, and intelligent and witty for the mature audience.8/10",8,0,0,5 June 2020
Us," 'I have the highest kill count in the family'
","And that's about the only 'joke' in the movie that made me smile for a moment. 'Us' definitely did not aim at a horror comedy, and for a serious horror it is too frivolous. Technically well-done, it has some very nice cadres, good atmosphere, and the performances of the leading four, and especially Lupita, are on a high level. I won't go into the story itself, because even a brief summary would be a spoiler. The idea is original and very interesting, but it seems that they have not thought it through to the end. The film starts slowly and gradually introduces the characters and the plot, and builds up the atmosphere. Everything indicates excellent horror. But when the mystery begins to unfold, it does it quite amateurish. There are holes and illogicalities, and some moments are plain stupid. The final twist is good, but although it is not predictable from the start, you will anticipate it just enough before it happens to spoil the surprise effect. Although the premise is so bloodcurdling that it itself should send shivers down your spine, the movie simply isn't scary. To me, it felt like six out of ten, but I have to raise it, at least slightly, above the stupid slashers of the eighties.7/10",7,1,3,21 June 2019
Ice Age: The Meltdown," A consistent and worthy successor to the previous film
","Due to global warming, Ice Age is coming to an end and the herd from the first film has to get away from the upcoming flood. Technically, the film is at the same level as the previous one, and the story is new, fresh and fun. The story does not have the depth and drama that the first 'Ice Age' had, but in terms of adventure and comedy, it does not lag behind. I fairly laughed and had a good time.7,5/10<ul><li>'Do we have to bring this crap?'</li></ul>'It was a gift from my mother.'<ul><li>Stop, hey, what's that sound</li></ul>All the mammoths are in the ground<ul><li>If your species will continue, clap your hands...</li></ul><ul><li>She's a ton of fun.</li></ul>",8,1,1,5 November 2018
Spider-Man 2," I'm sorry, but...
","I believe I'm not objective this time. I saw this movie few times, three I think, and it simply does not touch me at all. I didn't notice any holes or illogicalities in the story, everything runs smooth, every scene is polished to perfection, special effects are excellent and Tobey and Kirsten have sparkling chemistry. I should rate it at least nine, but I simply can't. Movie feels like seven and, although I can't support it with arguments, I simply can not give it more than that. In my opinion, Spider-Man is the most boring superhero I have ever encountered with.7/10",7,6,10,17 October 2017
The Fifth Element," 'Where did he learn to negotiate like that?'
","In the distant future, a dark force is approaching the Earth in order to destroy all life. The four stones which represent the four elements in combination with the perfect human being as the fifth element are the only defense of mankind against destruction. (I wonder how women look like in 300 years distant future if Milla Jovovich represents perfection...) The army, an order of priests, an alien race of warriors and some criminals, all trying to be the first to get hold of the five elements.The story combines SF, action, drama, romance, and comedy, in a way that is at times totally ridiculous, but this film should not be taken seriously, because its sole goal is to entertain and it does it more than well. Technically it is top-notch and at that time it was the most expensive film made outside Hollywood. The cast, besides Milla Jovovich, includes many well-known faces, such as Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman, Ian Holm, Luke Perry, and Brion James, and although their performances are not Oscar material, the characters are diverse, original and very entertaining, and for this type of film, they are just right. The directing is great, there are some excellent cadres, and the special effects are amazing for that time. There are also aria unachievable for the human voice, performed by a singer whose name is in the Serbian language, the biggest explosion ever recorded indoors, the language invented especially for this film, creations by Jean-Paul Gautier and a multitude of ingenious details. Interestingly, Luc Besson began to write this script in the age of sixteen, but managed to finally film it twenty-two years later.8,5/10",8,0,0,5 December 2018
Batman Returns," Great sequel
","Sequels are often unwatchable and almost never keep up with original or succeed to be great films independently from prequels. But Tim Burton obviously doesn't know how to fail.

What can you possibly put in those sequels that won't be copying and repeating the same story with slight variations... Maybe they do copy, maybe they repeat more or less the same story over and over again, maybe they catch us on pathetic emotional tricks and nostalgia, but those tricks obviously accomplish their purpose extremely well. Emotional scenes bring tears to our eyes, fights keep us on the edge of the seats, Stallone acts better and better in every new sequel, production becomes better every time. Maybe it is not original, maybe it uses old tricks to get to us, but it is still great, I mean really great movie.8/10",8,0,1,13 February 2017
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," 'Nobody gets to kill you but me!'
","'Wolverine' is a standard Marvel's blockbuster. Expensive, great effects and production, visually impressive and full of fast-paced action that is trying to divert your attention from an expectedly lousy scenario. Logan and Victor have good characterization and Hugh Jackman and especially Liev Schreiber are excellent in their roles, but the rest of the characters are just packed to fill the space. Characterization and motivation of other characters are nonexistent and they leave no impression, and the story is interesting but very poorly developed. I love the origins stories and I hate when their potential remains so unutilized. This was the third time I've been watching this movie, and while I watched it, I had the impression that I was watching it for the first time. It is so forgettable that nothing has left in my memory from the previous viewing. It probably deserves one or two grades lower, but I have to treat it as it is quite entertaining.7/10",7,0,0,1 October 2018
Hot Fuzz," Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg are winning combination
","When I watched Scott Pilgrim vs. the World I had no idea who director was nor was I interested at all. After Baby Driver name Edgar Wright began to get the significance. Then I saw Shaun of the Dead and decided to watch everything that this man made. Hot Fuzz, the second film of this 'trilogy', takes over Shaun of the Dead's cast and style and takes them one step further. Movie begins a little confusing and it seems that it will not be able to maintain the level of its predecessor, but then in the second half it turns into a black comedy thriller that overcomes it in every way. Original and completely unexpected turns with continuous bombardment with quality humor will glue you to the screen. Perhaps it is not one of the best movies of all time, but it certainly is one of the most entertaining.8,5/10",8,0,0,11 February 2018
Constantine," Decent entertainment
","Heaven and Hell are in eternal battle for souls, but angels and demons are prevented from staying on Earth. 'Half-breeds' are living among humans, and by them Heaven and Hell affect people, but they are also prohibited from direct influence. They can only direct people to good and evil and provoke situations in which the real human nature of nature will show itself. If they violate the rules and thus disturb the balance of good and evil, John Constantine, a man with a gift to see the world of angels and demons, is there to stop them and 'send them home.' Keanu Reeves is satisfying as Constantine, but in my opinion he is lousy actor who reduces quality of any movie he's in. I do not like Rachel Weisz in the main female role neither, and there is no chemistry between them. Tilda Swinton is also lousy and the only actor who really leaves positive impression in this flick is Peter Stormare in the role of Lu(cifer). Story is interesting, directing and special effects are good and movie holds attention. It's worth watching, but don't expect too much.7/10",7,0,0,1 March 2018
The Others," 'Sometimes the world of the living gets mixed up with the world of the dead'
","While I watched it several times since it came out, until a moment ago I had no idea that the film is Spanish. And not only is it Spanish, but it's also the only film that has ever won the award for the best Spanish film, without having a word in Spanish. Although the original script was written in Spanish, it was translated into English, it stars an Australian woman playing an English woman, it's backed by Americans and the story is placed in Jersey, but it is filmed in Spain and directed by Spaniard. IMDb classifies him as a horror/mystery/thriller, but even though the story itself is a mystery and perhaps somewhat a thriller, and the film has an atmosphere that balances on the verge of horror, in my opinion, essentially, this is primarily a strong psychological drama. Nicole Kidman once again proves her acting size and steals every scene in which she appears, but the rest of the team are not to be underestimated, especially eleven-year-old Alakina Mann. One of the strongest features of this film should be the surprise brought by the final plot twist, but since I saw it several times, I knew what would happen, and I really can not remember whether I predicted this twist or not when I first watched it, almost two decades ago, and if I did, in which part of the film it happened, and therefore I can not comment on its effectiveness. But even without the mindfak factor, this movie has a lot of qualities and deserves a high rating.8,5/10",8,0,0,22 January 2019

","For more than a decade, I refused to watch a movie about gays. Man, was I wrong! Although technically the movie is about gays, essentially this is a film about forbidden love, with which many of us can identify, regardless of sexual orientation and the specific circumstances of our own experiences. A well-told story, so emotionally charged that it will make even homophobe cry. The fantastic performances of Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are incredibly convincing and deserve Oscars, not just nominations. And let's not get any further on, the film is simply perfect.

He is convinced that he is the best, and he dreams of proving it by defeating the famous 'Minnesota Fats' and taking him at least ten thousand dollars (the equivalent of today's hundred thousand). Unfortunately, as with most things in life, talent and skill are not enough, and the difference between winners and losers is largely determined by maturity and character.'The Hustler' is, on the one hand, one of the best billiard films. Games were choreographed by fourteen-time world champion Willie Mosconi, who was also in charge of performing the most complex shots. And, on the other hand, this is an excellent character study of a man incapable to snap out and make something of his life until he touches the bottom first. The film deservedly won Best Cinematography, Black-and-White, and Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White Oscars, and all the main actors were nominated. It was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Writing, so there is no need to rattle about technical qualities.

Terminator Salvation," Terminator Violation (2009)
","Have you ever wondered what the private parts of the terminators are hiding, and are these movie characters sexually functional? Even if this did not come to your mind while watching Schwarzenegger in the second and Kristanna Loken in the third film, the series 'Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles ' very clearly insinuates this issue. The creators of the fourth film seem to have succumbed to a decades-long sexual frustration and decided to brutally rape the franchise. If you have not seen this garbage yet, I advise you to suppress curiosity in order to keep this cult franchise in a good memory.Writers did not have any idea in which direction they will develop the story, and even who are the main protagonists. The movie is two hours of completely meaningless noisy action that does not lead anywhere. The characters are two-dimensional and totally uninteresting, acting mediocre, and even Christian Bale in the role of John Connor does not stand out from mediocrity. John Connor is practically supporting role and Bale's performance is characterless and bored, as if he was forced to play in the movie against his will. Arnold Schwarzenegger's cameo is a pretty insipid and redundant detail, and Helena Bonham Carter appears just briefly.To avoid being hater who sees only negative things, I have to mention pretty good performance of Sam Worthington in leading role, and the scene in which Bale says legendary 'I'll Be Back' and then we hear the song from the first movie 'You Could Be Mine', although pathetic, is quite a successful trick to provoke nostalgia in the audience. Even I, who had fought the entire film with the urge to give up on it, for a moment succumbed to this emotional manipulation.3/10",3,1,3,21 July 2018
500 Days of Summer," 'This is a story of boy meets girl, but you should know upfront, this is not a love story.'
","Yes, it is, this is a love story. But this is not a typical love story we are used to seeing on film and the kind we are used to reading in love novels. This is neither a romanticized tragic love from heartbreaking dramas, nor a 'lived happily ever after' fairy-tale, nor a romantic comedy. This is the story of love as it really is - silly and serious, gleeful and pathetic, seductive and painful, enlightening and ignorant, energetic and depressing, full of unexpected joy and disappointing, all of that randomly and at the same time ... and above all unpredictable, like life itself. Few of us can identify with Romeo and Juliet, or Don Juan, but I believe that most of us have at least once experienced something similar to this, and this makes this film much stronger and more lifelike than most love stories. Because this is not so much a story about love, as it is about life.8/10",8,2,3,4 May 2020
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Second best adventure ever <3
","For me, this one was the best so far. A bit too long for my taste, but so are previous two so I can't complain on that. Well designed adventure, with bit less characterization than before, but those are the same characters we already got to know well, so it should not bother anyone. Acting is good, story shifts between drama, fast action and emotional parts in tempo that prevents you to get bored during 3 hours of this awesome adventure. I could even go so far to compare it to the Lord of the Rings movie. It's not that good, but in its genre, for me it holds honorable second place right after The Return of the King. 10/10My favorite parts... opening scene is one of the best I ever saw. I had goosebumps when they started to sing. And during reception at Singapore, when Keira disarms herself, her body talk and facial expressions irresistibly remind of Jack Sparrow.

Peter Parker is portrayed as self-pitying selfish cry-baby, Mary Jane is a personification of negative prejudices about women, and in the role of Venom we have Eric Forman from 'That '70s Show'. And by it I do not mean only that it is the same actor, but virtually the same character in the new environment. The film has no focus at all and is fading into a multitude of insufficiently elaborated stories and characters, with too many bad guys, none of which is the main one. Two and a half hours of meaningless action, based almost exclusively on excellent effects and some pathetic scenes.

Thor: Ragnarok," 'Thor: Ragnarok embraces its preposterousness and swims in a pool of ridiculousness, with the deadpan and self-mocking humour hitting all the bulls-eyes.'
","The most effective way to understand the difference between DC and Marvel movies is to look at Nolan's Batman and Thor: Ragnarok. From the beginning, Marvel spiced their superhero flicks with a touch of humor and light atmosphere, but here they have turned the game. So far it has been difficult to precisely determine the genre of Marvel's films, but this time there are no doubts. The new Thor is a comedy, action comedy, and one of the best Marvel films, side by side with Deadpool, Doctor Strange and Guardians, maybe even slightly better. Story itself breaks out of a superhero pattern, the characters are comical, and even those we've seen in the previous films got a relaxed and comical note, and the one-liners are hilarious. Comedy here is not just spice, like in the previous films, but from the beginning it strikes right into the head and does not stop to the end of the film, varying from light humor, through 'WTF?!' and 'I can't believe what he just said/done,' to the complete shame-transfer.

Humans send Kyle Reese to save her. The rest is history.From today's perspective, this action SF is still good, but largely out-dated. Subjectively, I would rate it six out of ten. But when you take into account that it was filmed in 1984, that it had a serious impact on the genre and career of several actors, as well as anti-nuclear message and warning that technology develops faster than our ability to manage it safely, the rating must go up.8/10I would like to add another observation. If the film was exactly the same as it is, with the only difference that Terminator was not a robot but a ghost or a demon or something like that, it would probably be classified as a horror. This movie has all the elements of '80s horrors, and the only difference that distinguishes it from them is the quasi-scientific premise.",8,1,3,19 May 2018

The Hateful Eight," Who did it murder mystery anti-western
","Tarantino's last movie belongs to western sub-genre known as anti- western. While classic western has clear, even black and white distinction between good and evil, where we know from the start who's good and who's bad and we are drawn to root for good guys, anti- western brings more realistic picture of Wild West. In old movies white folks are good guys and Indians are cruel primitives, or sheriff against evil gang and similar fairy-tale plots. Pretty unfair and unrealistic. Anti-western is trying to show things in shades of gray, from the 'villains' point of view, making them just another people who are fighting for their spot under the sun.This genre by itself raised up my expectations. And when you add Tarantino as writer and director, Morricone in charge of music, and in leading roles we have Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, this movie is masterpiece in advance. Board game 'who-did- it murder mystery' played out as theater play and made into movie. Everything is played out in single room and it's based more on dialogue than action. It starts slow, gradually builds atmosphere and culminate in explosive finale. Almost everything in this movie is Oscar material, from the screenplay, scenography, camera, directing to excellent acting. Jackson is expectedly great in a role that's perfect for him, but Jennifer Jason Leigh definitely stole the movie with her absolutely magical performance. Still, movie misses 'that something' for me to rate it ten out of ten.9/10",9,1,4,29 October 2017
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," 'You just keep thinkin', Butch. That's what you're good at.'
","You can find this biographical Western on many lists of the best movies of all time and it holds the 219th place on IMDb Top 250 list. The film tells the story of two legendary robbers and gunmen who were harassing the Wild West at the beginning of the last century. The sister of the real Butch Cassidy attended the shooting and was thrilled by how scenario and Paul Newman faithfully portray her brother. Technically, the film has no obvious shortcomings, Paul Newman and Robert Redford are excellent, and the rest of the cast are on the level too. The music is unusual for this genre, but very good and it won an Oscar. The film is an adventure crime drama, but it has a strong comic note, masterfully measured to be extremely fun but it does not escape into comedy. The strongest trump is certainly well-written dialogues that, although humorous and witty, serve not only as 'comic relief,' but primarily for the characterization. In every respect, this is a great film, but still, it did not leave such a powerful impression that I would rank it at the very top of world cinema.8/10",8,1,2,11 March 2019

This time, unfortunately, that was not a case. The film is based on the true story of the famous Boston mobster who spent decades at the FBI's Most Wanted List. Classic cliche crime drama about the mafia the likes of which we've seen many times in the past, and which does not bring anything new to this outworn genre. Not a trace of originality.

Underworld Awakening," Underworld Franchise (2003-2016)
","Still a better love story than Twilight :DSet (predominantly) in the present day, this fantasy franchise tells us of a centuries-old war between vampires and werewolves. We follow the story from the perspective of Selene (Kate Beckinsale), one of the greatest vampire warriors, who leads the werewolf hunt. When she meets Michael (Scott Speedman), a man who is persecuted by werewolves for a mysterious reason, her life and worldviews change drastically. This saga has quite a well-crafted story and characterization, though as the franchise goes on, the quality of the story declines to eventually turn into a shallow action. The acting, the camera, the directing, the effects, the music ... it's all pretty well done, but nothing spectacular.Underworld (2003)The first film introduces us to the dark world of vampires and werewolves, which secretly coexists with ours. While vampires are a well-organized society with a powerful army, werewolves are a wild unleashed horde that is gradually exterminated by vampires. And then emerges a leader capable of uniting werewolves, as well as a man capable of uniting the features of both races in one hybrid being. A good thriller with a story that will intrigue you, and with just the right amount of romance and well-directed action.7/10Underworld: Evolution (2006)'Evolution' continues directly to the first movie and now Selene and Michael are trying to break into the history and secrets of both races, in a desperate attempt to bring the centuries-old war to an end. A worthy sequel in the same manner and quality as the first film.7/10Underworld: Rise of the Lycans (2009)'Rise of the Lycans' is an 'origins story' and takes us into the Middle Ages. Vampires were aristocracy, and werewolves were their slaves, until the young werewolf Lucian rose into a leader who led his race in the struggle for liberation, thus beginning a centuries-old war between the two races. The franchise still holds a level.7/10Underworld: Awakening (2012)Humans discover the existence of vampires and werewolves and decide to exterminate them. Michael and Selene are hit while fighting humans and she wakes up twelve years later, not knowing what happened to Michael. She now has a twelve-year-old daughter, the first natural-born hybrid, who she must protect from Lycans that want to take advantage of her in their fight for dominance.The fourth film is slightly weaker than its predecessors. The action continues in the same manner, but the story is underdeveloped. I was under the impression that I was watching a long movie trailer, not the movie itself. But basically, I liked it.6,5/10Underworld: Blood Wars (2016)The latest installment in the 'Underworld' franchise is by far the worst, but not redundant. 'Blood Wars' rounds off this saga, but it does a rather lousy job, and the movie is reduced to eighty minutes of shallow action and two-dimensional characters that are there just to keep the story from staying unfinished. I don't want to recommend it, but again, you have to see it if you wish to know how the story ends.5/10",7,1,1,14 December 2019
Suicide Squad," Unbelievably disappointing
","This movie was made to match with Marvel's 'Deadpool'?! If DC wants to compete with Marvel (which I see no reason for, and no chance of success either) they will have to put much more effort into it. Not only that this movie did not bring them closer to Marvel level, it downgraded them big time. Without any competition, this was the worst DC movie I saw so far and probably the worst superhero movie overall. It would take me half the night to write everything that's wrong with 'Suicide Squad'. It is simpler to say that acting was mostly good and music is awesome, but everything else is a complete catastrophe.The story is not developed enough and it is full of holes and inconsistencies. For those who are not comic-book fans and don't have good knowledge of the DC universe, this movie is simply unwatchable. I had a feeling like when you turn on TV randomly to kill few minutes while you wait for the water to boil or something, and you run into some random movie that started who knows when and then you watch that random part somewhere in the middle and turn it off before it ends. OK, I would probably be able to paraphrase it shortly, but basically, I have no idea what I was watching. Characters are two-dimensional, without enough background, pretty much irritating, and a good amount of them is simply redundant. Too many characters without real purpose for the story itself just make unnecessary confusion. Joker was the trump card in advertising this movie, but he is a completely secondary character that barely shows up (5 minutes in theatrical and 15 in the extended cut) and in my opinion, Jared Leto is mishit for this role. Deadshot is black?! and too cute and funny for his character. Captain Boomerang has no purpose in this movie at all. Jay Hernandez was good as Diablo and Harley Quinn is probably the only good thing about this movie. She's hot and very entertaining. Everything else is just a mess of redundant characters and senseless action with no point. And production is nothing but decent.Overall impression... this movie is just one step above 'Power Rangers', and I'm talking about old ones.3/10",3,1,3,17 November 2016

","Halfway through:This morbid surreal thriller is indisputably well-made, but to me, it was so boring that I'm not capable of objective assessment of its quality. I'm not even sure if I'll endure to the end. I'm only a halfway through and I'm already bored to death. I had to switch from bed to chair to prevent myself from falling asleep...At the end:I do not think this has happened to me so far. I barely made myself watch it to the end, yet I still have the urge to give it the maximum rating. Excellent cast, great camera, directing, sound, atmosphere, but although I liked all those aspects individually, the overall impression was not that good. I love midf**k movies, perhaps it's my favorite genre, but this one was too Lynch-like for my taste. In the second half, however, it gets better and starts to keep me focused, and the outcome and especially the last scene are really powerful. I have to admit that this is one of the best movies I saw so far, but at the same time I did not enjoy it accordingly and I would not watch it again.8,5/10",8,0,1,28 September 2018

","I'm not a big fan of Marvel and, in my opinion, their movies are mostly overrated. This one isn't. This is probably the second best Marvel movie, after 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. If you expect a movie to have depth and the point, you should skip, not only this one, but whole Marvel production, but if you are looking for fun you are at the right place. Visually it is amazing. I recommend watching it in theater or at least on a TV as big as possible. Standard computer monitors or, God forbid, tablets are out of question. Although 90% of this movie is pure action and fighting scenes, compared to most of the genre, story and characterization are more complete and Benedict and Tilda are excellent. Sure, like in all Marvel movies, there is a certain amount of humor and finale is one of the funniest things I have ever seen in Marvel movies. The way Strange finally defeats the enemy is at the same time unbelievably stupid, unbelievably clever and funny to tears. I gave it 8/10 within all the movies I ever watched, but within the genre, it is pure 10/10.8/10",8,27,35,26 February 2017

But the story is so full of holes, illogicality and over-the-top moments, as if they have dropped in from some dark comedy, that they make the movie too surreal and make it impossible for us to get involved with the characters (except possibly Woody's) and take the story seriously, which is, at least for me, a serious deal-breaker for a movie that pretends to be a shattering drama.7,5/10",7,1,2,16 September 2019

The movie has touching story, dark and heavy atmosphere, great cast and directing, and it must have left the strong impression because, a few years after watching, I remember it as if I watched it a few days ago. Although I'm aware of its objective qualities, for some reason I did not enjoy it.

Rocky II," Expected, but necessary and beautiful
","It's rare to have a sequel keeping the level and even outclass the original. In my opinion, 'Rocky' is one of the greatest movies of all times, and the sequel keeps its level and even beats it in almost every way. Acting, directing, music... The movie is a bit faster than the first one and that makes it even more entertaining. But, I said 'almost every way' because, as a sequel, 'Rocky II' lacks originality. The movie has some new elements added and the ending is better, but it is almost the same as the first one, more of a copy than a sequel. However, it is kind of a story where it could not be any other way. The movie holds attention, brings emotions and ending keeps you at the edge of the seat with a lump in the throat and tear in the eye. A rematch of the legendary fight that had to be filmed and has to be watched, because these two movies simply do not go one without the other.9/10",9,2,2,9 December 2016

Bunch of movies has been made about con artists and mainly they are better than this one. The movie is interesting, but mediocre. Leading four really did a good job. In my opinion, in this movie, Jennifer did not deserve to be nominated for Oscar, but Bale, Adams, and Cooper nailed it.

I cannot say what is the issue, if it is acting or directing or music or what... but until just a few minutes before the end I had absolutely no emotions towards what I was watching and I was bored. For the idea and the very end of the movie... 9/10, but the overall impression is about 5/10.!!! SPOILER ALERT !!!Christian girl gets involved with a Muslim refugee and gets pregnant. Christian police kill the Muslim and her child is taken away at birth and sent to an orphanage. Many years later she gets revenge for the tragedy of her youth by killing the leader of Christian police. She ends up in prison where she is raped by the cruelest guard. She gets pregnant again and gives birth to twins. After she is released from prison, she takes her children to Canada.After she died her testament sends her children in a quest to find their father and brother and deliver letters from her. The daughter goes to search for the father and the son searches for the brother and they both find the same person.The orphanage was destroyed in the war and the child was adopted by attackers and trained to be a killing machine. He ends up as a prison guard where he rapes a female prisoner, not knowing it was his mother.Twins first get to know that their father is not killed in the war, as they were told. They find out that they are a result of their mother being raped in prison while she was serving sentence for murder. Then as icing on the cake, they find out that she was raped by the long lost son. So, in adult age, you find out that your whole life was a lie. Your mother is a murderer, you are a rape child, the rapist is your older brother, and you are just a side effect of sadistic, incestuous rape, and now you are expected to continue with your life as a mentally stable person... yea, right, like it is possible...So, I would like to improve this already sick movie by adding some epilogue to it:a) Father/brother receives both letters and, when his brain finally realizes shocking truth, he drops letters on the floor and jumps through the window (shoot himself in the head), while twins end up in a closed section of a sanitarium.or, for those who root for a happy ending...b) Twins cry in embranchment, which ends up 'horizontally', and father/brother accepts his newfound family and joyfully awaits the birth of his grandchild/nephew and they lived happily ever after.P.S. Yup, I know, I'm sick.7/10",7,0,6,30 October 2016

But this way, it left me completely shocked. I honestly wonder who's crazy here. 'Fargo' won an Academy Award for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. Okay, on paper this story really has great potential. I can also understand William H. Macy's nomination somewhat. But nominations for Best Picture and directing?! Really, WTF?! All the characters in the film, except the cold-blooded sociopath, are portrayed as slightly falling behind in their mental development. Both their actions and how they are portrayed by the cast cause chronic embarrassment transfers throughout the film. Something like that would work in some types of comedy, but with such characters and acting, to call this movie a drama or a thriller ... WTF ?! Directing also has nothing to do with these genres. Drama and tension do not occur even in trace amounts. The story may be a true event, and in reality it was probably a drama and a thriller, but the way it is presented in this movie is totally frivolous. It had the potential for upsetting drama, for a suspenseful thriller, and even for a morbid comedy, but this mix of the Coen brothers looks like a clumsy result of their hesitation to opt for the genre. Watchable, but probably the most overrated movie I saw in years.6/10",6,1,3,5 March 2020

I would not go so far as to place 'Bohemian Rhapsody' among the best films of all time, and I can not rate it a straight ten because it has its flaws, but I do not want to analyze it, because this time the technicalities are completely irrelevant. Although one part around the middle was quite boring, it could not spoil the overall impression. The great selection of actors and their even better performances, excellent music and some of the best songs ever written, and perfect balance of touching drama and good humor completely hypnotized me, so I spent most of the film either in tears or loudly laughing, and often both simultaneously.

Watchmen," At the same time one of the best and one of the most boring DC movies
","The film begins with confusing scenes that make no sense without a context, so I had the impression that I did not start watching the movie, but that I fell in the middle of the second season of some series. It is too prolix and discursive, without any focus on anything. Many things happen, but it does not make much sense and it looks like it does not lead anywhere. There are movies that start slow and even boring, but later everything starts to make sense, but here, even after more than two hours, there's no real plot to hold your attention. Okay, the movie lasts for three and a half hours, so at that moment there's still the duration of the entire average movie left, but two hours of introduction is really too much. After more than two hours story begins to get meaning and movie brings some really impressive scenes. Sex in the aircraft was first thing to wake me up a little and then follow the action scenes in prison and scenes on Mars. If the whole movie was like that half an hour or so, I would probably be thrilled, but two hours of boring introduction to the story at the pace of tectonic movements and over the top ending, with totally redundant pathetic elements, prevailed in the formation of the overall impression. Less than hour of excellent material with everything before it being boring and everything after it being stale. The best thing about this movie is great music (Nat King Cole, Bob Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, Janis Joplin, Billie Holiday, Leonard Cohen, Jimi Hendrix), and Carla Gugino, who, even in a supporting role, always improves the overall impression and makes me rate a movie at least half a star higher. All in all, a good point, great music and effects, fine acting and directing, but a bad scenario and inhumane duration.7/10",7,0,0,28 May 2018
Baby Driver," 'Easter Eggs' feast
","I usually avoid trailers, spoilers, reviews and any stories about movies I have not seen, and when I finally sit down to watch a movie, I do not know almost anything about them. But there was so much hype about this one that even I, who live under the stone, did not manage to avoid being dragged into it. Whether the movie is overrated or the hype has raised my expectations to an unrealistically high level, I'm not sure, but it didn't leave any particular impression on me. So far I saw 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' which I liked, but saw it so long ago that I shouldn't rate it from this perspective, and 'Shaun of the Dead' whom I gave seven a few days ago. As 'Shaun of the Dead' is fresh in my memory, I immediately recognized the same director in 'Baby Driver' (until that moment I did not know the director for either of these two films).Wright is great screenwriter and director, but in 'Baby Driver' he really made a step forward. I can't remember when I watched such a masterfully directed action. Gunshots and movements of characters in the film are in line with the rhythm of the music that is heard at the moment. And when you take into account that all the driving in the movie was shot without CGI even ten out of ten is not enough. I am also amazed by Wright's sense for details and quantity of 'Easter eggs' hidden in this film. When Baby is flipping through the channels on TV, several lines of dialogue from different movies can be heard. Each one of these lines appears later in the film as a line of dialogue. In the first scene, when Baby goes for a coffee and listens to 'Harlem Shuffle', he passes by the graffiti, signs, and posters that show the text of this song. In this scene, you can also see the reflection of Wright in the shop window. It's shot by accident but left in the movie on purpose. It instantly reminded me of Hitchcock. There are several references to 'Back to the Future' too. One of the cars in the movie has a license plate that represents the date when Wright's previous film came out. Singer whose song is played during the first robbery plays guard. While listening to 'Radar Love' song, Baby drives a car painted in 'Radar Purple'. There are countless details like these and even if you watch the movie a dozen times you won't even catch a half.Still, no matter how directing, soundtrack and sense of detail are perfect, in other aspects, this film is nothing special. Acting is good but, in my opinion, wasted on unoriginal characters. The story is mediocre and the atmosphere of the movie didn't move me. It was fun to watch but I forgot most of it very next day. I may watch it again, but only because I'm curious to try and find some more eggs that I missed the first time. Overall impression7/10",7,0,1,20 January 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The Lord of the Rings (2001-2003)
","'One Ring to rule them all,
One Ring to find them,
One Ring to bring them all
And in the darkness bind them'Tolkien's 'The Lord of the Rings' is a book that has introduced me to the world of epic fantasy and, while no longer in the top of my favorites, will forever hold a special place in my heart. I will never forget how I eagerly awaited this movie trilogy, as well as the thrill of the movies when I first saw them in the cinema. And with each new viewing, enjoyment is no less. Although I don't like movies this long, the twelve hours of 'The Lord of the Rings' just fly by.It is far from being the perfect movie, as many seem to perceive it. I find many changes to the book to be unnecessary hollywoodization. Elijah Wood never felt right in the role of Frodo, and his latently gay relationship with Sam will never stop poking my eyes. It may be up to me, but I've never experienced it in a book. There are a lot more of all sorts of minor complaints, but in spite of them, the overall impression of this epic trilogy in every respect is an unforgettable experience. A very well adapted story, camera, directing and effects that take your breath away, mostly excellent cast choices and ingeniously blended music that greatly enhances the already perfect atmosphere, make this film a masterpiece of the genre and, in my opinion, one of the best film achievements of all time.10/10",10,0,0,2 April 2020
The Matrix Revolutions," And I just did...

Man of Steel," His name is Kal, son of El.
","For me, DC has always carried more weight than Marvel. While Marvel was mesmerizing us with effects, and with the spectacular action imbued with humor was covering up the shallowness of the story, DC was making more serious and deeper films. Then at one point, they decided to get into a race with Marvel, taking over their style. To me, the new Superman looks more like Marvel than DC, and more of a classic space SF than a superhero movie. Technically, it's amazing, but I wouldn't be able to recount it in detail, even though I watched it yesterday. It made absolutely no impression. Fun for one watching, but without any weight and forgettable. The only pleasure I got from this movie is the sweetness of Amy Adams.7/10 (for the visual spectacle)",7,0,1,10 December 2019

The Thing," One of the most overrated movies ever
","It is considered to be one of the best horrors of the '80s and maybe even one of the best horrors overall?! If that's true I do not want to see the rest of them. I cannot say it is complete crap, but it definitely is waste of time. Extremely overrated nonsense with no purpose. The basic idea is good, but it's not developed nearly enough. Characters are two-dimensional and stereotypical. The movie has no depth, does not provoke thoughts, cannot be more linear than it is, does not arouse any emotions, there's no tension, and finally, it is not even scary at all. There are movies that are very stupid, but make you crap your pants in fear. Stupid but with purpose. This one is not even that. It is as if people who were accustomed to make only low-class action movies their whole lives suddenly decided to shoot the horror. Linear, shallow and boring.4/10",4,9,18,24 March 2017

","Bale, as always, has fantastically laid out the role, and his every film reinforces me in the belief that he is one of the best, if not the best actor of his generation.

In free time he is collecting spare parts of clocks trying to finish robot that he started together with his late father. One day he meets little girl who's grandpa works in one of station shops and adventure begins.

Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," They should have left it at two
","The third film in the 'Terminator' franchise deteriorates to the level of cheap action SF. (When I say cheap I'm not referring to budget, of course.) It does not bring anything new either in the story nor visually, but copies the previous film with essentially insignificant variations. Action scenes are greatly done, but since the film is virtually reduced to an endless series of explosions, it soon becomes tedious. Nick Stahl, in my opinion, is not an adequate substitute for Edward Furlong, Clare Danes is made for romantic movies and she was thorn in my eye through the whole thing, absence of Linda Hamilton feels too much, and the Schwarzenegger performance is weaker than in previous movies, although this is more to the script than to him. Practically the only thing worth watching in this movie is the beautiful Kristanna Loken in the role of the latest Terminator model. It's not boring, but if you skip it, you won't miss much.6/10",6,1,2,23 May 2018
The Shining," Kubrick's top three
","I never paid too much attention to directors and in the most of the movies I saw I was unable to recognize them. Besides Lynch and Jarmusch, Kubrick is one of the few that I could never mistake for someone else. All of his movies, however different their stories might be, share that insane atmosphere that simply screams Kubrick. Frames, angles, sound and his particular kind of creepy unmistakably betray him. While watching any of his movies I have flashes from his other movies. Although their plots are not related, this movie reminds me of '2001: A Space Odyssey' and bit of 'Clockwork Orange', and with those two makes the holy trinity of Stanley Kubrick's heritage. In my opinion, one of the best movies of all time.10/10",10,4,6,13 December 2016
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," 'It's in your nature to destroy yourselves'
","Since the first terminator failed to kill Sarah Connor and prevent the birth of a man who would defeat them, the machines send a more advanced T-1000 model in 1995 to kill ten-year-old John. At the same time, future John sends reprogrammed T-800 to protect him and the madness begins again.This time, the story is somewhat more complex, and 15 times bigger budget and advanced technology bring richer scenery and better special effects, so the film wins 4 Oscars: for sound, sound effects, visual effects and makeup. It gained cult status and, with 'Star Wars' and 'The Matrix', it's one of the most popular SF movies. Schwarzenegger moves from the role of a villain into the lead and gets more space to show what he's capable of and, despite popular belief, he's quite good. Linda Hamilton reprises the role of Sarah Connor and also provides much better performance than in the first film. And she looks better too. John Connor was the debut role for then fourteen-year-old Edward Furlong, which launched him among stars and provided him with a career on a big screen, and Robert Patrick made us believe in liquid metal robots and blurred the line between SF and horror.While the first movie has an essentially stronger story and more tense atmosphere, this one is more impressive on the technical side, and it's hard to say which one is better. After all, these are two parts of the same story and can be seen as a two-part film, which in my opinion deserves strong8/10",8,0,0,20 May 2018
Duck Soup," I would very much like anyone who liked this to explain to me one thing... WTF?!
","This film is considered one of the best comedies of all time. I cannot say if it was a good comedy back in the thirties, I wasn't there and maybe I'm incapable of perceiving it from that point of view. But if anyone would make something like this anytime in the last few decades, I'm almost certain it would be considered a total crap. In my opinion, this movie has absolutely nothing to offer. The storyline is supposed to be satire, but it's too stupid to be effective. There is no characterization at all and I couldn't connect with any of the characters. From my point of view, this is just a bunch of piled up jokes and slapstick gags that are not particularly funny, and not only they weren't entertaining enough, but after some time they became quite irritating. I was bored to death and I literally forced myself to endure it to the end. Subjectively, I would rate it two out of ten, but I have to acknowledge the impact this movie made on the film history, so I'll go with4/10",4,3,9,2 November 2018

Film may be excellent in many aspects but it failed in one very important thing - to hold viewers attention for over 3 hours. If it was bit shorter or if it was made as mini series for example, maybe I would enjoy it more, but this way I give it 10/10 for quality and 2/10 for interestingness. So...6/10, and if I include The Doors music into rating, then 5/10",6,0,2,11 October 2016
Edward Scissorhands," Gentle lovechild of Frankenstein's monster and Freddy Krueger
","'Edward Scissorhands' is a romantic drama about a lonely young man with scissors instead of fingers, who leaves the isolation of the Gothic castle in which he spent his whole life and comes into town among people. The story of isolation, socialization, human hypocrisy, stupidity and fear of everything that is different, but also about sincere friendship, love, and sacrifice. Edward is obviously inspired by Frankenstein's monster, with which he has a lot in common, although this is not a horror, but a warm and sad fairytale, and therefore Edward is also much milder 'monster'. Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder have excellent chemistry, which is understandable considering they were a couple during the shooting of this movie. Besides their love, on the set of this movie the friendship between Depp and Burton was born, and Depp has become a frequent occurrence in Barton's films. Burton rotates the same handful of actors through all his movies, but why would he change a winning combination. Barton's signature is obvious in both the story and the visuals - the film is magical, surreal and a feast for eyes. If you're even remotely sympathetic to Barton's style, 'Edward Scissorhands' will keep your attention from the beginning to the end and leave you overwhelmed with emotions.8/10",8,0,0,11 January 2019

Cruise is a bit older and much less irritating than usual, the rest of the crew is awesome, action scenes are adrenaline feast but the movie itself is not an action movie anymore. It's more of a spy thriller, and a good one too. The movie starts fast and rushes faster and faster until the perfect ending. I could not find any weak spots in this sequel and it definitely is the best one so far. I gave it 9/10 only because 10/10 is reserved for the best movies of all times, classics of cinematography that will never grow old, and I could not go that far to put MI in the same box with them.

Dunkirk," Greatest War Movie I Saw So Far
","I hate everything connected to guns, army, war, so consequently I avoid war movies (after this one I'll get aerophobia as well, and I'm not so eager about swimming in the sea any more). Movie doesn't have specific plot or leading characters, but rather tries to convey the atmosphere of this historical event. This is in itself a risky venture, and when you take into account that it is a WWII, Dunkirk had a tremendous chance of, at least for me, being an unwatchable crap. But Nolan pulled this off. With this film Nolan proved that he can pull off whatever he wants. Although there are no characters to bond to and for whose fate I would tremble, camera, directing and sound kept me at the edge of my seat from the beginning to the end. When I sat to watch this I was sure I'll give up latest at half of it, but instead Nolan earned one more devoted fan.9,9/10To me, this is one of the best war movies ever. Still, I won't rate it full ten because its end slightly disappointed me. First, why the pilot did not jump out of the plane above 'safe' part of the beach, letting plane to crash somewhere in distance?! I supposed he thought he could land it safely so he decided to give it a try and save the plane. But once he succeeds he burns the plain and get captured by enemy. WTF?! Second, that diarrhea monologue in the train was completely redundant. In no way does it contribute to the understanding of the film, but dilutes the atmosphere of the film, which up to that point will not let go not for a moment. Dammit Nolan, you pulled off 99% of the movie in same tempo, why did you have to spoil it in last minute?!",10,0,3,22 December 2017

Acting, directing, production, special effects (especially hippogryf), everything is on high level and finale is great, but with story itself something definitely isn't right. Something's missing.

The Amazing Spider-Man," 'Oh, I'm in trouble'
","It wasn't very clear to me why would anyone make new Spider-man trilogy just five years after the previous one ended (quite poorly), but as I decided to see all Marvel flicks... I read IMDb reviews and cross myself. Tastes differ, that's a fact, but to rate this movie from one to three out of ten is nothing but spite. There is no way that anyone seriously thinks that this film is unwatchable crap, except of course if they look on the whole superhero genre that way, in which case it would be fairer not to evaluate it at all.'The Amazing Spider-Man' is a reboot of the Spider-man franchise with a slightly different approach than Raimi's. The story is basically the same, but a bunch of details is changed. In some respects, this version is more faithful to the comic book, and in every respect I liked it better. The most obvious and critical difference is the characterization of Peter Parker, who, unlike the pathetic weenie from Raimi's version, is now a rebellious teenager with whom it is easier to identify. Also, Garfield is much more likable than Maguire, though he does not exactly fit the role of a nerd. The film has a great pace and balance of drama, action, and humor just to my liking. A little laughter, a little sitting on the edge of a chair, and two hours flew by. The only advantage of Raimi's version, very subjective though, is that, to me, Kirsten Dunst is much more attractive than Emma Stone, and the chemistry between her and Tobey is stronger than between Emma and Garfield.8,5/10",8,2,2,9 August 2019

Sequels, even good ones, usually cannot match originals, but this one is so much better than the first one that it is beyond any comparison. The story is much better developed, without idling, there are no two-dimensional characters, everyone is credible and persuasive and fun in their own ways. Big step up in visual and sound effects and overall atmosphere of the movie and, while 'Alien' was pretty much boring to me, this movie kept me at the edge of the seat.8,5/10 (within the genre it's pure 10/10)",8,3,5,7 March 2017

This movie has very high ratings on film sites, it was nominated for ten Academy Awards and won two (for adapted screenplay and sound), and it enjoys a status of one of the best movies in the genre. With due respect for its cult status and people who love it, in my opinion, it is silly to classify this movie as a horror at all, moreover as one of the best ones. Personally, I prefer Leslie Nielsen's parody.6/10",6,0,3,7 July 2019

","The four magicians respond to mysterious calls to arrive at a certain place at a certain time. A year later, they are 'The Four Horsemen', the world's greatest illusionist attraction. The grand finale of their most spectacular performance is to perform the illusion of bank robbery from the stage. It turns out that the bank is really robbed and the police, with the help of the former illusionist, who has reoriented to exposing the illusions of others, is trying to find out what happened and catch the mysterious four.This film does not possess depth, philosophy, and hidden messages, nor aspire to some sort of artistic value. This is an illusionist action movie, whose purpose is to entertain, and in that purpose, it succeeds. If you're not a film snob and enter this adventure with realistic expectations of this genre, you can expect an awesome ride and you will not lack the adrenaline. Although not comparable to the greatest cinematic achievements, within the framework of its genre and goals it is trying to achieve, this film is perfectly executed and deserves the highest rating. In addition to the other qualities, there's really exceptional cast, among which are Mark Ruffalo (three Academy Award nominations), Woody Harrelson (also three), Morgan Freeman (one Oscar won out of five nominations) and Michael Caine (two out of six).10/10",10,1,2,18 December 2018

Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," A masterpiece of fun for all ages
","I saw it in the theater yesterday, and although it was not what I expected it to be, it was a very pleasant surprise. 'Harry Potter' without Harry Potter is great.While 'Harry Potter' franchise is focused on children in Britain's magical community and adults and the magic in the rest of the world are mentioned only in passing, 'Beasts' takes us to America where things are set differently. Something terrorize the city and slightly clumsy magical beasts lover, fired Auror, and muggle who was incidentally involved in all the mess are trying to solve the mystery and prevent the magical world being exposed. And in the focus of the story there is a magical suitcase that's bigger from the inside, as if it originated from Doctor Who's Tardis and Terry Pratchett's Luggage combined.The movie is fast, resourceful, very witty and entertaining. The cast is excellent (Johnny Depp shows up only for a brief moment, but I hope they'll give him more space in sequels), CGI is great and there's lots of it, and magical beasts are truly fantastic. You'll fall in love with them for sure. The story doesn't have that epic feeling like 'Harry Potter' had, but it is epic fun for all ages.8,5/10",8,4,9,30 November 2016
American History X," Even amazing Edward Norton could not make me blind for its flaws
","I understand how this film managed to hype the masses, but it's a complete mystery to me how it withstood the test of time and even after twenty years it is considered to be one of the best films of all time. The movie undoubtedly has its qualities, but its flaws are much more numerous and painful.On the positive side, if the idea was to criticize Neo-Nazism and racism, I support that. I also like the idea to make the movie more effective by running the whole thing from the angle of a skinhead. And the strongest trump of the film is that this skinhead was played by Edward Norton. His appearance, charisma, acting skills and the transformation of his character through the film definitely deserve an Oscar, but unfortunately, he was in competition with Benigni's performance in 'Life Is Beautiful', against whom no one would stand a chance.Furlong's performance is not for underestimation either, but besides two of them, the most of other characters are pale and uninteresting. In fact, most of the film is totally unconvincing, which may be a good thing, because if it already (accidentally) sends the wrong message, it is better that it is not powerful. I am literally allergic to racism and Neo-Nazism and I found myself rooting for Skinheads... Although I believe that the author's intention was to criticize it, the film instead romanticizes the 'white power' movement. I suppose the purpose of this romanticizing is to show us how it all looks in the eyes of the kids who decide to join it, and that would be perfectly fine if the film showed the other side of the coin equally striking. But if I, in my forties, so easily fell under the influence of this romanticizing and found myself rooting for Skinheads during almost the entire film, I am afraid to even imagine the influence it could have on immature kids with crazed hormones, and that is something I can not forgive. There are many examples, but the basketball game is one of the most obvious. I'm pretty sure we all rooted for Skinheads to win the bet, and even worse, they did. And then follows zenith of believability when black guys quietly pick up their things and leave the court with lowered tails. Yea, sure, in reality it would happen exactly like that.By far the weakest point of the film is the end. I think the idea was to aggravate the overall impression and strength of the film with earthquake tragedy, but that murder in the school toilet was so stupid and unconvincing that, instead of tears, caused my jaw to fall in disbelief. Neither there was appropriate motivation for it, nor would anyone, even wildly adolescent, brought it up in such a place and in such way. I knew that in the end one of the brothers would have to die, but I expected them to get killed out of the passing car as they walked to the school, or through the restaurant window, and I expected the gang to kill Norton as a retaliation for the black guys he had killed. That would be upsetting and make sense. But this toilet murder was simply stupid. And what's even worse, it's not even the original end of the movie. After the toilet murder, there was supposed to be a scene which would somewhat repair the damage made by this ridiculous killing. According to the script, the film ends with a scene in which Norton stands in front of a mirror shaving his head. This scene would round the story perfectly, made it more realistic, convincing and vigorously tragic, but Norton refused to do it.Norton's performance is fantastic and so striking that it is perfectly understandable that it has blinded many eyes and distracted them from all the drawbacks of this film. If you are watching a movie focused exclusively on Norton, you will easily overlook all its shortcomings and experience it as a masterpiece, but I think that, if you watch the film again after reading this review, you will understand what I'm talking about and deprive it of some undeserved credit. Ten out of ten for Edward Norton, but about four or five for all the flaws, some of which I did not mention.7/10",7,0,1,30 October 2018
Saw III," Tumbling down...
","I loved first movie. I am aware that sequels are often worse than original, but I expected them to stick to formula that worked so well in first movie, so even if sequels have no quality they would at least be fun. I saw second Saw that pretty much keep up with first one and I could not wait to see more. I never expected such unpleasant surprise. I knew this franchise will in time most probably lose some of its awesomeness, but such drastic drop in quality between two contiguous movies really surprised me. Saw III is not so bad by itself, but in comparison with first two this is complete catastrophe. First, it is boring. Few scenes twist stomach pretty successfully, but to achieve that effect one does not need much skill. Tension, suspension and fear are nowhere to be found. Second, this movie insults my intelligence. Unlike in prequels, story is completely linear, boring and predictable. And in addition to that it's full of holes and illogicality. Characters and their actions are unconvincing, especially Jeff. He lost so much time in every room for no obvious reason. If himself was threatened in any way I could understand his hesitation, but he was not. I have no nerves to get into the details, cause it would take to long. Further, flashbacks are lousy and have no purpose in story. For those who saw previous two films they just make this one more boring and unnecessarily stretch it to almost two hours. Last and the biggest disappointment was the end. Regardless of your taste and opinion about first two Saw movies, one thing you have to acknowledge and it's genius mindfak twist that ends them both. Here, they could not make effort even to achieve that. Ending is totally predictable. I knew how it will end, but I hoped that movie made me think that on purpose so they could make even bigger surprise when it ends differently, but that did not happen. It ended just as I suspected and I felt deprived. Movie ends in manner of low-budget gore horrors. In those it's not a flaw cause they do not pretend to be more than they are - movies based on disgusting scenes that do not need intelligent plot to achieve their purpose. But in Saw franchise that present itself as intelligent mystery thriller this is unforgivable. First hour I was bored but hoping that it will get better in time. During second half I was just sad and had to force myself not to give up before the end.5/10",5,1,1,11 October 2017

Spirited Away," Best Movie for Grownups Who Refuse to Grow Up
","Although I don't like the anime style of animation, it didn't bother me this time. The story, if it is literal, does not make much sense, the characterization is lousy, and the motivation of the characters' actions is completely unclear. If the story is symbolic, maybe I did not understand it. One of the reasons for this may be that there was no script for the film, but it was written along the way. There is also a cultural gap between the East and the West. The authors were aware of this, so English-language synchronization contains more text than the original Japanese version, in order to explain to the Western audience some of the things that the Japanese perceive. But I was watching the original Japanese version, so I was deprived of these explanations. Based on what I have written so far, it looks like I didn't like it, but it's not so. All objections are negligible before the unique beauty of this accomplishment. Rationally, I would impose an average grade of five, or perhaps six, but this film does not aim at reason, but wins at a much deeper level. That's why in 2003 it won the award that suits it the best - Best Movie for Grownups Who Refuse to Grow Up. In addition, it won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, as the first anime ever nominated in this category. It is also one of the two animated films that have ever won Japan Academy Prize for picture of the year, and it holds the 27th place on the IMDb Top 250. Deserved.8/10",8,1,2,13 April 2018
Duck You Sucker," You're a grand hero of the revolution now
","You're a grand hero of the revolution now'I know what I am talking about when I am talking about revolutions. The people who read the books go to the people who can't read the books, the poor people, and say, 'We have to have a change.' So, the poor people make the change. And then, the people who read the books, they all sit around the big polished tables, and they talk and talk and talk and eat and eat and eat. But what has happened to the poor people? They are dead! That's your revolution! So, please, don't tell me about revolutions. And what happens afterwards? The same (censored) thing starts all over again!'From the very beginning, the film will shamelessly attract your attention. It is opened by the close-up of the urine stream, drowning insects on the tree. Close-up shots on details, especially the face and eyes, are a kind of trademark of Sergio Leone, and he uses them skillfully and frequently to show the atmosphere and more accurately depict the psychological state of his characters. For the fifth consecutive time, music was entrusted to the legendary Ennio Morricone, but it is so different from the music in the previous films that by style I would never have thought that Morricone was in question. Moreover, it did not fit in with the movie, and it irritated me so much that I was tempted to watch the film without sound.This time, instead of a gunslinger, the main character is an explosive specialist, an Irish revolutionary who is forced to leave his homeland, and goes to join the revolutionaries in Mexico. Along the way, he meets Mexican bandit and tricks him into joining him and helping the cause. Although it definitely is Western, this film greatly differs from the classic representatives of the genre, because it is also socially and politically colored war drama, as well as a psychological study of morality, family, friendship and searching for oneself. The presence of humor somewhat dilutes the rather heavy atmosphere of the film and makes it, in my opinion, much more relaxed than this story deserves, but also significantly more fun.The biggest drawbacks of this film are John's flashbacks, which, although they support the characterization of his character, completely derail the movie from its path, and the last one, in my opinion, is unnecessarily disgusting and more appropriate to some pathetic romantic drama than the war western, as well as totally inappropriate music, which may not be bad in itself, but it does not fit in this movie. If not for flashbacks and music, this movie would stand shoulder to shoulder with other Leone's masterpieces, but these two flaws totally ruined the overall impression.7,5/10",7,1,1,11 October 2018
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Wright's best
","This is, so far, probably the best Edgar Wright's movie. However, I still have to look at his debut 'A Fistful of Fingers', but I doubt it can even be compared with this. Scott Pilgrim is a twenty-two year old boy with a serious lack of confidence, who dates a 17-year-old student and falls in love with a girl with a complicated emotional past. He has to find the strength to break up with the kid and defeat the seven exes of his new girl. Instead of boring or pathetic love drama, this film Scott's overcoming his own insecurity and girl's emotional luggage displays in the form of fights in the style of 'Mortal Combat'. Whole movie was made in a combination of video game and comic-book style. Acting and music are good, and the camera, direction and editing will make your head spin. In this action romantic comedy, Wright once again shows his skill and genius.9/10",9,0,0,16 February 2018

","This lovely melodrama has a fair story and acting, and on the technical side it is quite decent. Although I do not like Patrick Swayze, and I consider Jennifer Grey to be a bit on the ugly side, their chemistry is incredibly addictive, but the main advantages of this flick are great music, for which it won an Oscar, and a lot of erotic dance. Objectively, the film is about a six, but due to awesome music and the powerful emotion it evokes, it has become a cult hit, especially among the women. Thanks to my sister, who's crazy about this movie ever since she was a kid, I saw it countless times, and I must admit that it got under my skin.

","It is almost unbelievable that this movie was made in the '30s and even now, 80 years later, it is not a bit outdated. It has a beautiful, well-written story and the amazing cast that brought it to life. It is technically and essentially brilliant and when it finished I had the urge to watch it all over again immediately. The only thing that stopped me was lack of time, because this masterpiece lasts for full four hours. And the people say the book is better. I definitely must read that. 10/10",10,3,6,14 October 2018
The Butterfly Effect," Event Reborn
","Someone in my FB movie group recently mentioned this movie and I couldn't recall it in my memory, so I went to take a look at my own review. But there wasn't one. When I saw it again, I understood why I didn't write anything after the previous watching. I had to sleep on it, for impressions to settle, before I was able to evaluate it, even subjectively.'It has been said that something as small as the flutter of a butterfly's wing can ultimately cause a typhoon halfway around the world.' - Chaos TheoryAnd in essence, this is the basis of the film's plot. Ashton Kutcher plays a young man who finds a way to change the details of his own past, thus completely changing the present and the future. Unfortunately, every time he fixes one thing, he simultaneously messes up something else, embroiling himself in playing God more and more.It's fun to watch actors from your favorite series ('That '70s Show', 'Daredevil', 'My name is Earl'...) all together in the same movie. When actors go from film to film, there is not enough time to connect them closely with the characters they interpret, as is the case with actors who interpret the character in the series from episode to episode for many seasons. And when they appear in a movie, after we've watched them for years as the same characters in a series, it is a bit strange. And when there are more such actors in the same movie... confusing.For its relatively small $ 13 million budget, the film is technically great, the acting is good, and the story keeps your attention from start to finish. I mostly like the fact that the film has a mindfak charm, although it's not one, because everything's pretty much clear all the time. There are four alternative endings and both times I saw 'director's cut', which has the most striking finale. I don't want to write spoilers, but if you saw or will see this version, pay attention to the relation between the scene where Ashton's mother tells him that she had a few miscarriages and the way our protagonist resolves the whole situation. When my brain linked these two things, the entire movie significantly gained strength.8/10",8,1,1,3 January 2019

Days of Thunder," Top Gun on the ground
","Tom Cruise in an action movie about NASCAR drivers - I was convinced I would quit after about fifteen minutes. I was wrong. Although I am not a fan of films like this, nor of the aforementioned gentleman, the film has held my undivided attention from start to finish. Although this movie is primarily an adrenaline fun, the story makes sense, has some depth and message. Nothing new or original, but universal enough that it does not become obsolete. Besides, the film features Nicole Kidman in her early twenties, which in itself is reason enough to watch it. And there are also Robert Duvall, Randy Quaid, and John C. Reilly. The sound is great, and the roar of racing cars is accompanied by a legendary soundtrack (Gimme Some Lovin' - Spencer Davis, Break Through the Barrier - Tina Turner, Trail of Broken Hearts - Cher, Hearts in Trouble - Chicago, You Gotta Love Someone - Elton John, Show Me Heaven - Maria McKee, The Last Note of Freedom - David Coverdale,...). The only thing I would object is that the plot is extremely predictable from start to finish, so there is no tension, but the good pace and scenes of car racing make up for this shortcoming, so the movie is not boring for a moment.7/10",7,1,1,11 August 2019
Batman Begins," Demystification of superhero
","Although my average rating of all the Marvel and DC movies I have ever seen is the same (6.7/10), I have always been more inclined to the DC universe. This film only reinforced my position. I can not say that this is the best superhero movie so far for the simple reason that it's hard for me to put it into that genre at all. While Marvel flicks are mostly shallow action movies sprinkled with humor, and DC films keep the two-dimensional comics atmosphere, here we have a completely new approach, the complexity and depth of a serious drama.Batman Begins, as name suggests, brings the detailed origins and genesis of this superhero and gives background to everything we've been watching about him so far. All that we took for granted in previous versions, because it was vaguely hinted or not explained at all, here it is elaborated to the tiniest detail, thoroughly and rationally. Drama of Bruce's loss of parents, his growing up, inner struggles, how he acquired the skills he possesses, what kind of devices allow him to move and fight and how he got them, everything is clearly and thoroughly explained, which completely demystifies Batman. That's why I think that Nolan's Batman is too realistic to be considered a superhero movie. I wonder how much this action thriller with drama elements is even faithful to comic-book it's based on...From a technical point of view this movie is excellent. Camera and directing are great and in combination with scenography and music they create very serious and dark atmosphere. The cast is top-notch. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman and Rutger Hauer are names that guarantee flawless performance. Still, although I love Katie Holmes, and I consider Christian Bale one of the best actors of today, in my opinion two of them do not fit into the atmosphere of this film at all. Katie leaves the impression as if you put single actress in color technique into black and white movie. I can not pin any flaws to her, it's just that her appearance and charisma simply stick out from the rest of the movie. At the other hand, Bale as Batman is just fine, but as Bruce Wayne I think he's pretty much a failure. The story itself is excellent, not completely linear, yet not too tangled, with a good characterization and sequence of events without holes and illogicality. My only complaint is predictability. I suppose that the discovery of the main villain, who is working on the destruction of the Gotham from the shadows, should have been a surprise, but it was clear who it was from the very beginning. Still, the absence of a surprise factor in this case does not have too much effect on overall strength of the film.8,5/10P.S. I'm only sorry that Katie saved Joffrey back in 2005. Because if she killed the little bastard back then, he wouldn't grow up to terrorize Westeros six years later. :D",8,0,0,25 January 2018

Twilight," Yuck...
","I have not read the books, and I have no intention, so I am only talking about the movie here, without favor or prejudice. The film is simply bad. There is not one single aspect I can praise, but nothing is so catastrophically bad to be worthy of bashing. An uninteresting tale that desecrates vampire mythos, told in a ludicrous and pathetic way, played by non-charismatic actors who have no chemistry between them and all the while feel as if they are bored. The effects are bad for 2008 and such a big budget, the makeup is ridiculous, to say the least, there is no drama, tension, no emotion at all, and if the film has some subtext and conveys a message, I failed to notice it. It is not boring or tiring to watch, but it is so lame, that in an endless sea of good movies, even in this genre, it is a shame to waste time on it.4/10",4,1,4,3 April 2020

The Grand Budapest Hotel," A feast of colour and sound
","I'm reading reviews and I cannot believe what I read. Amount of bashing on this movie is unbelievable. And arguments they use... Either I'm crazy or they are. They say it is not funny enough for a comedy and I say it is not a comedy, so why would it have to be funny. They say that great actors gave lousy performances and I really cannot see that any of the actors failed to shine here. They say characters are two-dimensional, I say it's kind of fairy-tale, they are supposed to be kind of two-dimensional, and in my opinion, they are not anyway.This is a beautiful drama, disguised in some sort of fairy-tale with elements of comedy and action movie, but it is a drama. It tells a story about human nature and friendship and it tells it in an amazing way. The cinematography here is excellent and stunning. It is a feast of colour and shape. And sound and music... hypnotizing and delightful. This movie is a feast for senses and it is more about how it tells the story than the story itself. If they cannot realize that, it's their loss. This is a work of art, not some cheap adrenaline injection.Warm recommendation for those who have the ability to relax and enjoy, without overthinking unimportant details.9/10",9,0,1,6 November 2016

","I don't like action movies and I have an allergy to Tom Cruise, 'Mission Impossible' is pretty much stupid franchise and... this movie is great. It is fast, but easy to follow. The plot is typical for an action, it's almost completely linear, but nicely put and shot. The action keeps you at the edge of your seat from the beginning to the end. What I liked the best is the fact that Tom is not superman anymore. So far he was unbreakable and unstoppable and his plans were perfect. Now we see his plans go south and he has to reorganize as he goes. Also, he gets seriously hurt in tougher fights and he has to move forward with abilities limited by his injuries. That makes the movie more convincing and Tom more likable and the whole movie is a lot more interesting, because you start to worry for him instead of being bored by knowing nothing could happen to him. The best part of the franchise so far.8/10I rated it 8, but it is an 'action 8' and cannot be considered the same level with for example drama rated 8.

Although, it could be considered to be prequel to original movie from 1968. if we completely disregard details, cause this movie implies how apes took over Earth, but not in the way that's explained in original movie. Although it's done in manner of modern Hollywood blockbusters, which makes it weaker than its predecessors by default, story is good, drama and action nicely balanced, and it's interesting to see CGI apes instead of people in costumes. And of course, John Lithgow who is spice that makes every movie better. Weaker than Schaffner and Burton, but still it's very good movie.8/10",8,0,0,21 June 2017
City of God," Subjective taste is crucial...
","Rio's favelas are ruled by poverty and the struggle for survival. Teenagers and even children are turning to crime and only the most violent and the most unscrupulous survive. And even then only until someone even crazier comes along to kill them off and replace them. This explicitly brutal film portrays such a life very realistically, at the same time criticizing the state of society and giving a glimmer of hope that it may still be possible to get out of it all. Shocking story with a strong message, superbly shot for relatively little money. The impression is even stronger when you take into account that in most roles are not professional actors, but children who grow up in such an environment and contribute firsthand to the script. The ending, while somewhat expected, further intensifies the story, and I cannot point to any specific flaws of this film. However, it did not emotionally move me nearly as much as is necessary for the highest rating. Maybe it's up to the movie, maybe it's up to me, but I can't go over8,5/10",8,0,0,21 August 2019

Avengers: Infinity War," Series finale
","Last night I went to the cinema to watch 'Infinity War' and I wasn't thrilled at all. I'm aware that it's partly my fault, but anyway I think it's extremely overrated. Seen by itself, the film is completely meaningless, because this is not a stand-alone film, but the grand finale of all Marvel films that precede it. So, it's not just recommended that you have seen most of Marvel films before, but it's absolutely necessary that you have seen them all and that they are fresh in your memory. I watched most of Marvel films, but some of them I skipped, and many of those I did see I saw too long ago to remember them, so 'Infinity War' left me with the impression of a bunch of amazingly shot, but empty action scenes, without the story that gives this action a meaning. It's like if you watched the last hour of 'The Return of the King', without previously watching the rest of the trilogy or reading 'The Lord of the Rings' ever before. Most movies have a part that introduces you to characters, then introduces them into a story, then develops and elaborates the story, and ultimately takes you through the blow-away finale. This whole movie is one huge finale, while all the other elements that you need to experience this finale right way need to be found in other Marvel films. Each of the previous films brings new characters, introduces you to them and connects them to the characters from the previous films, builds their mutual relationships and portrays small parts of the big picture, and then 'Infinity War' puts all these characters together and, assuming you already know who they are, what their relationships are and what was happening in their individual stories, it immediately cast you right into two and a half hour of action madness, without any characterization and explanations, and with a minimum of the story that serves just to separate the action scenes. Marvel films are a literally series in which the episodes are somewhat independent, and this is the last episode, and do not even try to watch it if you didn't follow entire series. Although visually excellent, to me 'Infinity War' was terribly confusing and even boring, and I will refrain from rating it until I see all the movies that precede him, and then repeat it with good background.",7,1,7,18 May 2018

","I saw the new Tarantino last night and I think my impressions haven't settled just yet. At first glance, this is a beautifully filmed, but empty film in which almost nothing happens, and seemingly without a point, so I understand the people who didn't like it. Honestly, I'm not even sure I fully understood it. On the other hand, the top cast, beautiful camera, Tarantino's directing, and some typically Tarantino's elements (although, at first sight, the film overall isn't his style), and most of all the nostalgic atmosphere of Hollywood from the setting of the Golden Age, leave an unexpectedly strong impression, and even in the slowest and seemingly the most pointless of moments it is not boring and has kept my undivided attention from start to finish. And those more versed in the era that the film portrays and events it skillfully insinuates will find additional satisfaction in innumerable details that will go unnoticed by the average viewer. I can not say that it is a masterpiece, but it certainly is a work of art, and is definitely worth watching, whether you're a fan of Quentin Tarantino or not.8/10",8,1,3,24 March 2020

Unfortunately, in a manner of many movies these days, a fantastic 90 minutes story was stretched and raped to 150 minutes and the final blow to the quality of this movie inflicts Ben Affleck who is lousy by default. I never saw a movie where Affleck gives a stunning performance and even my favorite 'Chasing Amy' is partially ruined by his sleaziness.

Today I woke up at four AM, worked all day, got back home more beaten than usual, are something, played three hours log movie, and I saw it through without blinking. Enough said. I wonder if Tarantino knows how to make a movie that is not fantastic. So far, I didn't rate any below nine out of ten. I will not analyze this one because it is perfect in every aspect. I just want to mention the music. The music is, in my opinion, totally inappropriate for the genre, place and time in which the story is set, and often for what is happening on the screen, and it very distinctly stands out from the film. On the other hand, music is excellent and fiercely enhances the effect of the film. The music is in a perfectly harmonious discord. Madness.10/10",10,2,6,19 February 2019

Ghost Rider," Terribly underrated
","'Ghost Rider' has very low ratings and reputation of one of the worst Marvel movies, and it slowly starts to worry me that this is an increasingly common case with my favorite movies. I'm watching Marvel chronologically, and of the 24 films and series I've seen so far, this one is in my top 5. I can not say I'm amazed, but it was close enough.The story is one of the most powerful in the Marvel universe, and a dark and fairly serious atmosphere is more in the spirit of DC than Marvel. Considering one of the lowest budgets in the genre, the film is very well done and I have no objections from the technical side. An excellent balance of action, drama and humor, which is rare in Marvel films, keeps the attention from start to finish and, if you are a more careful observer or you watch it several times, you will notice a lot of interesting details. There are Bible quotes, characters borrowed from other Marvel stories, references to 'Apocalypse Now' (a film directed by Nikoilas' uncle), scenes made as a homage to painters and all sorts of interesting stuff. It is interesting fact that Nicolas Cage is a big fan of comics, especially this one, so he fought tooth and nail to get this role, and even has a tattoo of Ghost Rider that they had to hide when shooting. He is such a fan(atic) that he took his stage name from comic character Luke Cage, and he named his son Kal-El after Superman. Director does not fall far behind Cage, because he gave money from his pocket for shooting some of the scenes that the studio didn't approve. All in all, this is the movie that true lovers of comics made from the heart, and it's really sad that it is so badly (un)accepted by the audience and criticism. I rate it strong eight.8/10",8,3,4,12 May 2018

","I return to this movie from time to time for the last two decades. I do not like Damon and Affleck, but this is their lifetime achievement and the most deserved Oscar they will ever win. Beautiful drama about finding yourself, finding a balance between the essence of life and its everyday appearance, about love and friendship. Realistic, unpretentiously philosophical and warm movie about life. Two main trumps of this movie are its perfect script and brilliant Robin Williams, the actor that adds warmth and love in everything he does. I can not say it's a masterpiece of cinematography, but it surely is beautiful, intelligent and it never gets old.9/10",9,1,3,22 June 2017

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The Lord of the Rings (2001-2003)
","'One Ring to rule them all,
One Ring to find them,
One Ring to bring them all
And in the darkness bind them'Tolkien's 'The Lord of the Rings' is a book that has introduced me to the world of epic fantasy and, while no longer in the top of my favorites, will forever hold a special place in my heart. I will never forget how I eagerly awaited this movie trilogy, as well as the thrill of the movies when I first saw them in the cinema. And with each new viewing, enjoyment is no less. Although I don't like movies this long, the twelve hours of 'The Lord of the Rings' just fly by.It is far from being the perfect movie, as many seem to perceive it. I find many changes to the book to be unnecessary hollywoodization. Elijah Wood never felt right in the role of Frodo, and his latently gay relationship with Sam will never stop poking my eyes. It may be up to me, but I've never experienced it in a book. There are a lot more of all sorts of minor complaints, but in spite of them, the overall impression of this epic trilogy in every respect is an unforgettable experience. A very well adapted story, camera, directing and effects that take your breath away, mostly excellent cast choices and ingeniously blended music that greatly enhances the already perfect atmosphere, make this film a masterpiece of the genre and, in my opinion, one of the best film achievements of all time.10/10",10,0,2,11 October 2016

","I just watched it for the first time and it really is highly above average movie, excellent in every aspect except for one. It has the same issue as 'Apocalypse Now', it is too damn long. In the middle, I simply had to give up. However, a few hours later I decided to finish it and, of course, I was amazed. Movies that can nail you to the screen without even blinking for over three hours are extremely rare, and this one, same as 'Apocalypse', is not one of them. Because it is stretched too much and only because of that, I cannot give it more than 8/10. If it stayed under two hours it could be pure 10/10.8/10",8,3,9,21 October 2016

","This is one of the most entertaining movies I ever watched, and I saw over a thousand in the last few years. Action is not set in some superhero universe, it's in our world where heroes are just comic-book characters. A kid who is completely into superhero stuff decides to become one, although he has no powers and, even worse, he is a clumsy nerd. And then he realizes that he is not the only one who came to that idea.The movie is extremely funny, has Nicolas Cage in one of leading roles, 12 years old Chloë Grace Moretz nailed one of her first serious roles, and music is awesome with The Prodigy, The Pretty Reckless, Sparks, and many other great bands.9/10",9,0,1,2 November 2016

Call Me by Your Name," Boring and nasty
","When two people have real chemistry it doesn't matter if they are man and woman, two men or two women. They completely mesmerize you and you root for their love no matter what. Even in extreme cases such as 'Lolita'. But that's not the case here. I was extremely bored with everything that does or doesn't happen in this movie from the beginning to the end, and in a few scenes, I was even disgusted. And that's not because I'm homophobic, 'Brokeback Mountain' is one of my favorite movies, but because this movie is simply boring and these two people feel terribly wrong to me. Instead of rooting for them, the strongest emotion I felt while watching this was sorrow for that poor girl Elio screwed, literally and figuratively. The movie is far too long, too empty and unconvincing, and the only bright moment of it is the scene at the very end, when ending credits start and Timothee Chalamet shows his true skill, making everyone who has ever been brokenhearted relive that memory.5,5/10The scenes from which my stomach turned over: Third place is shared by the scene in which Marzia tells Elio that she is afraid he would hurt her, he was at that time already aware of his feelings for Oliver and he still has sex with her and then leaves her, and the scene where Oliver tells Elio that he's getting married. In the second place is the moment after which the film got its name, and the first place is convincingly held by the peach scene. I was at the edge of vomiting...",5,3,15,16 August 2018
Shrek the Third," Great, but not amazing
","'Shrek the Third' was made in the same manner as the first two, as a combination of parodies to various fairy tales with references to pop culture. But even though it's a top-quality cartoon, it's not at the level of its predecessors. Animation and music are excellent, but there's less humor and it's less funny. While I was crying of laughter during first two movies, this time I sincerely laughed just a few times. Although, to be honest, I'm not sure if this is due to a weaker scenario or it's simply saturation, because sequels that stick to the recipe of the first film inevitably lack originality and the surprise factor. Movie is great, but it does not bring anything new.7,5/10",7,4,5,13 May 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Carina: 'I'm not looking for trouble.' Jack: 'What a horrible way to live.'
","The fifth film of the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise is in every way 'the same' as its predecessors. With minor exceptions, where it fails or shines for a moment, the whole franchise leaves an impression of one big movie. In terms of the story and in terms of directing, editing, camera, effects, sound and acting, all five movies are more or less at the same level, therefore I have nothing to say about this movie that I have not said before about previous four. I just want to mention the end, which simply screams 'Disney' and 'Hollywood'. Very emotional happy-end, with no humor and without any cliffhanger or at least an indication of the temporality of happiness, somehow does not fit into the tone of this franchise, but although it is typically Hollywood pathetic, or as Captain Jack Sparrow said: 'What a truly revolting sight', I admit that it has achieved its purpose and I ended up with a few tears in my eyes.8/10",8,0,1,2 December 2018

","I do not like musicals. I really don't. But 'Moulin Rouge!' is something special. Story is based on 'La bohème' by Giacomo Puccini, 'La traviata' by Giuseppe Verdi and 'Orpheus in the Underworld' by Jacques Offenbach. Although it is a tragic love drama, the film is full of quality humor, positive energy and good entertainment. From great actors (if these are not the best roles of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, they are certainly my favorite), through catchy music and excellent choreography, to camera, directing and editing, this film has no flaws. The range of the emotions that this movie awakens is incredible.

Soon he leaves Vienna, but fifteen years later returns and, under the new name, becomes a famous illusionist. They meet on one of his performances and the old flame revives. Since she is now a fiancé of the Prince, it will take much more than the cheap tricks to reunite them.This mysterious romantic drama features superb cinematography, dark atmosphere and a great cast, led by Edward Norton, one of the greatest actors of his generation. The main female role was meant to be interpreted by Liv Tyler, but, luckily, she gave up at the last minute, and in her place came the fascinating Jessica Biel. There are also Rufus Sewell in the role of Prince and Paul Giamatti, who was excellent in perhaps the most interesting role in the film.

Miguel is a boy who dreams of becoming a famous mariachi, but his family has banned music for generations. It is up to Miguel to change this unfortunate tradition with the help of the late great grandfather.Beautiful animation, which does not skimp on colors, a story that is both fun and emotional and, although twist is somewhat cliche, essentially powerful and edifying. A movie that will entertain the youngest, teach them a little about life, and at the same time, elicit a few tears even from those whose emotions are long since numb.

Mulholland Drive," Much better than I expected
","Story is one of the most boring and pointless ones I have ever had misfortune to see in a movie. But it would be hypocritical to hold it against this movie and use it as excuse to rate it in lower half of the scale. It would be unfair for two reasons. First, because everyone who has even basic knowledge about Lynch work knows what kind of nonsense they should expect from his screenplays. Although I said I won't see another Lynch movie ever again, the moment I decided to see this, partially because of majority of critics being extremely positive, and even more because of Naomi in leading role, I was ready to endure whatever nonsense Lynch passed off as an art this time. Second, because movie is not just about the story it tells, and this one has a lot to offer beside the lousy story.Visually, this is work of art with very distinctive and striking atmosphere and, to me, very lovely details and cadres done as homage to cult TV show Twin Peaks. Even more than visual aesthetics, I was impressed by sound. And I do not speak only about soundtrack and legendary Badalamenti, who also did music for Twin Peaks, but also about sound effects throughout the movie. The strongest impression on me was left by Spanish version of Crying by Rebekah Del Rio and sound of frontal crash in the beginning of the movie. Excellent performance of Naomi Watts implies, cause she is the main reason I decided to see another Lynch. She is definitely worthy that sacrifice.But the very strongest impression of all was made by sweet Naomi and super-sexy Laura Harring in the hottest lesbian scene I have ever seen outside a porn. Although it is very short and not explicit at all, it is so deeply emotional and sexually charged that it left me completely breathless.All in all, I do not regret breaking my word and watching another Lynch.

Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," I honestly liked it
","It is the fact that the presence of the Disney company is clearly felt in the film. It is also a fact that the story has more holes and illogicalities than the previous parts of the franchise and that at times it is over-the-top ridiculous. And it's also the fact that, while watching the movie, I did not pay attention to any of this at all, because I completely enjoyed the entertainment. Only later, when I was browsing reviews on the internet (which almost unanimously rate this movie one or two out of ten), with every argument I read I was rewinding the movie in my head and realizing that the criticism is valid. But even though the things haters wrote about it are accurate, I really liked this movie. If not with the story, with audio-visual experience and even overall atmosphere, 'The Last Jedi' quite satisfactory respected the legacy and spirit of the franchise. It took it a little time to catch the momentum, but when it really started it kept me at the edge of my seat till the end. Comic reliefs may be too frequent and exaggerated for hard-core fans of the franchise, but, in my opinion, they are quite good and have excellent timing. Yes, they give this movie a bit of 'Guardians of the Galaxy' kind of feeling (Marvel is also Disney), but as I like 'Guardians' more than original 'Star Wars', it just made it more enjoyable for me.7/10",7,5,30,12 November 2018
Evil Dead," This time remake is better than original
","Although I'm usually against remakes, in this case I fully agree with the project. Movie tells essentially the same story as the original, but with more serious approach. While 'The Evil Dead' (1981) was shallow, stupid, cheap and over-the-top to ridiculousness, 'Evil Dead' (2013) is serious horror movie. The story is better developed, with more convincing details, and has a much better dramatization and characterization than the original (not to say that there's none in the original flick). It begins as a drama, introduces us to characters, builds suspense and eerie atmosphere, and only after twenty minutes slowly moves with the introduction of horror elements in the story. Actors are completely unknown to me, which, if they are good, is a great addition for watching horror movie. The acting and directing are good, music is atmospheric, and the effects are, although they copy original and do not use CGI, much more credible and effective. Maybe I'm a sissy, but I had to pause few times to relax. The film retains many of the original scenes, but the roles are scrambled. Good example is cult scene in which Ash cuts off his hand with chainsaw. In remake, demon takes over hand of one of the girls and she also removes it, but unlike the original story, here the cutting does not help and soon the demon takes over and she dies. This change in the story is quite fine, but one thing I can not forgive - they replaced Ash's chainsaw with small kitchen electric cutter... wtf, really?! The end is completely changed, but it's great. All in all, a top horror, a recommendation to all fans of the genre.8/10",8,1,3,1 March 2018

Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Uma Thurman has really ugly feet
","At the time 'Kill Bill' came out, movies were a totally minor thing in my life. I watched them relatively often, but I did not payed any attention to 'details'. I had no idea who the director was, and the question is whether I knew at all what the director was. Besides Uma Thurman, I think I never heard of other actors back then. I rated movies on a very simple scale - whether it's fun or not. This one was fun for a ten. Fifteen years and several thousand films later, I look at movies from a completely different angle and 'fun' is no longer at the top of the criteria that distinguish good movies from bad ones. Now I analyze them in more detail and I still haven't found any flaws in this one.It could be said that Quentin Tarantino's talent is a gift from God, but I think it's far more likely that he sold his soul to the Devil. The lowest rating I have ever given to one of his films is nine, and I'm not a 'fanboy'. 'Kill Bill' is an action thriller, and for me action films are the lowest form of the seventh art. But Tarantino's ability to create an action movie which is also an art film is fascinating. The story is crazy and great, but the least important. Camera work, fight choreography, use of color and sound and feeling for details make this film a masterpiece of cinema. The cast is more than good, and Tarantino manages to get the most out of them. I doubt that any of these actors have ever given a better performance than in this movie. And, of course, music! Music is very diverse, totally unexpected, often even unsuitable for the scenes it follows, yet again in such a perfect (dis)harmony with the divine scenery and crazy choreography, that it all leaves the viewer breathless. For movies like this one even ten is depreciation.10/10",10,1,2,22 May 2018
Saw II," Just a bit weaker then its prequel
","Movie has some really dull moments and its concentrated more on people panicking than on solving new puzzles and that disappointed me a little. At the other hand, it has some advantages to previous one. While in first movie Jigsaw appears just briefly, in second we have a chance to enjoy great performance of Tobin Bell. Twist at the end, that's maybe even better than in prequel, revels to us a puzzle more complex than last year's. Idea on which movie is based is better than one from previous movie, but realization is weaker. Overall, Saw II is somewhat weaker than its prequel, but still within solid eight.8/10",8,0,2,7 October 2017

The Last Emperor," Name Bernardo Bertolucci is written all over this film
","The Last Emperor is a upsetting drama about a man who spent his whole life in a cage, being someone's puppet. He grew up in the Forbidden City, where he played the leading role in a theater without an audience. He was raised and educated to regard himself as a sublime creature, but the cage is a cage even if it is made of gold. When communists took power in China, he gets asylum from Japan, where he continues to maintain the illusion of Emperor while being a Japanese marionette. When the Russians liberate Manchuria, he ends up in prison where he finally begins to grasp the world around him as it really is.Under the baton of Bernardo Bertolucci was born a movie which was nominated for nine Oscars and won all nine. It takes almost three hours, it's slow and not so entertaining, but the depth and strength of this drama does not leave room for boredom. This film is both technically and essentially excellent and I recommend to everyone who did not watch it to make up for that failure.8/10During the film, I had the impression that some parts of it were very familiar, as if I had already watched it, and I'm sure I didn't. It was only on the last scene that I discovered why, because the loan was so large that it could not go unnoticed. Korean film The Last Princess was apparently created after the model of this film. The titles of the films are almost identical, the story has a lot of similarities, and the end of The Last Princess is almost copied from The Last Emperor. The fact is that the stories of the last Korean princess and the last Chinese Emperor by their very nature must have some similarities, but the similarity of these two films is too large to be attributed to coincidence. All other similarities could be accidental, but the end is definitely rip off.",8,1,1,4 February 2018

Mission: Impossible II," Better than original, or at least more honest
","After the first 'Mission Impossible', I was thinking to delete the rest of this franchise without watching. But back then I bought the soundtrack for this movie because of the Metallica song that was not released anywhere else. And it was a pretty good soundtrack. Because of music, I decided to give this movie a fair chance and, to my surprise, it was not bad at all. I did not like the first one because it pretends to be a thriller that keeps you in suspense and it pretty much failed in that attempt. I'm not saying this one is more intelligent, but at least it does not pretend to be. This is a typical Woo action movie with lots of chasing, fighting and gunfire and, in own genre, it is really OK. If you don't have high expectations you will enjoy in well-done adrenaline rush scenes and that's all. And it has a cute babe in the lead female role.7/10",7,2,4,21 December 2016
The Dark Knight," Worthy sequel
","While 'Batman Begins' combines super-heroic elements with a drama that demystifies the Dark Knight, the second part of the Nolan's trilogy is well written and even better shot action thriller that extends the story, but doesn't deepen it. In some ways, this film goes beyond the quality of its predecessor, but in my opinion it somewhat lacks depth and soul that the first film had, and this makes it slightly weaker. The strongest aspect of this installment is the excellent characterization of Joker's character and the perfect performance of Hit Ledger, for which he was posthumously awarded the Oscar for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role. Frankly, I do not see how his role is any less major than Bale's. The man stole every scene he appears in.8/10",8,0,0,25 April 2018

"Girl, Interrupted"," Role of her life
","I was amazed by this movie when it was released. Two decades later I run into it and decided to watch it again. I must admit I have no idea why was I so thrilled back when I was 20. It is undeniably good, but it does not break into 'required reading'. The cast is excellent. Angelina Jolie inviolably dominates the movie and, although she is in supporting role, I think this was the role of her life. She deservedly took Academy Award and a dozen more first places on various film festivals. Winona is Winona, I was never able to form a coherent opinion about her. There are also Jared Leto, Whoopi Goldberg, Brittany Murphy, Elisabeth Moss, Vanessa Redgrave...

2001: A Space Odyssey," I finally saw it on the big screen
","I watched this movie several times at intervals of several years and every time I barely made it to the end. I attributed my inability to like it by saying that I was too young to understand it, that I was not in the right mood, and so on. In the end, I gave up. Until tonight, when I finally got a chance to watch it at a cinema.I gave it one more and last chance...Every cadre of this movie, standing by itself, is a work of art, followed by an excellent sound. Together they build a fantastic atmosphere that in a movie theater has a hypnotizing effect and it compensates for almost complete lack of plot. If I saw this back in the '60s in a theater, I would almost certainly give it 10/10. But watching it at home, on a small screen and without a quality sound system, this hypnotizing effect is lost and what is left is a pretty much boring movie that seems like it would never end. That's why I rated it seven, the average of visually beautiful and audibly genius film, and the fact that I usually give the movies, which I must compel to endure, two, maybe a three. But tonight's experience proved my theory that this movie must be seen in a theater to be fully experienced. After watching it on the big screen, I changed my attitude toward this masterpiece and I'm giving it a ten.P.S. Ending scene, with the baby floating in space, is surely one of the creepiest things in the history of cinematography.

The Graduate," He did mother and daughter and it isn't even a porn
","Mike Nichols deservedly won Academy Award for this story about a college graduate, torn between his older lover and her daughter. It is coming of age love drama sprinkled with some hilarious moments. Dustin Hoffman nailed the role and it launched his career. The story is well-written, well-played and directed, with great photography, but probably the best thing about this movie is the music of Simon and Garfunkel. Still, I wouldn't place it amongst the greatest movies of all time.8/10",8,1,1,13 October 2018
Singin' in the Rain," Genius Gene Kelly in one of the best music scenes in the history of cinema
","This film is on all the lists of the best films of all time. Interestingly, neither Gene Kelly nor Debbie Reynolds won any awards for this film, while Donald O'Connor took the Golden Globe. I love this film very much, but I would not include it in the best achievements of the world cinema, even within the genre.8/10",8,1,1,12 June 2018
Once Upon a Time in America," 'The pleasure is all mine'
","This was originally conceived as a six-hours long movie in two parts, but the producers forced Leone to reduce its length. There are several versions of this film and it is interesting that the same critic who declared two and a half hours long version as the worst film of the year, a few years later declared the version of three hours and forty-nine minutes as the best movie of the '80s. No one saw the original version of six hours, and at nine o'clock last evening I finally sat to watch the directors cut of little over four hours. I finished it at five in the morning. I paused it a few times to let the impressions settle, rewound many scenes several times to make sure that I understood them well, or that I did not miss a single detail, or simply because I wanted to see them again. And when the movie was over, I had that feeling that usually occurs after the last episode of your favorite series that you've been following for years.The film is based on the semi-autobiographical novel 'The Hoods' by Harry Grey, a former gangster, and it describes the path of a group of Jewish mobsters, since childhood in the streets of New York in the early twenties, through the rise in Prohibition, to the epilogue in the late sixties. The camera and directing are, expectedly, fantastic, and many of the scenes and details in the film are Leone's homage to gangster films from the first half of the twentieth century, but the story itself was nothing special to me. All the time while watching, I thought I'd rate it a seven or eight. But now, when it's over, I miss it. The film has a moderate pace, and the events are carefully weighed that at no time do they look movie-like, so that the story is very realistic and life-like. And the characters ... The characters are so well written and played that they feel real, and you will experience them as people you know and as if you are at every moment with them, somewhere just outside the reach of the camera. This is not surprising when you take into account that almost all the major roles are entrusted to Oscar-winning actors or those who have at least been nominated for this award.Two leading roles are played by Robert De Niro, who has two Oscars behind him, five nominations and over a hundred roles, and James Woods, with two nominations and over one hundred forty roles. There are also Elizabeth McGovern and Tuesday Weld, with one nomination each, Burt Young with one nomination and over one hundred sixty roles, Oscar-winning legend Joe Pesci, a man born to play villain William Forsythe with over one hundred forty roles, Mario Brega who played in all Leone's films, and many other famous faces.Leone's swan song is at the same time the first feature film of Jennifer Connelly, which was a stepping stone for the successful career of this Oscar-winning actress. Apart from acting skill, Jennifer is, especially to the male part of the audience, also known by the sexy body that she does not hesitate to show on the big screen. At the audition for the role of Deborah, Jennifer was less than twelve years old, and when the film was released in theaters she was fourteen. Although the credits state the name of the double who replaces Jennifer in the nude scene, some sources say that the scene was filmed with minor Jennifer, and that the name of the double is a scam to avoid legal consequences. It's a scene where Deborah gets undressed after exercising ballet (the ballet scene is inspired by Edgar Dega's paintings) and in which we see her only from behind, so I can not say anything with certainty, but it didn't seem like a double to me.And of course, we must not forget the greatest surprise this movie brings - the music was done by, you won't believe this, Ennio Morricone.10/10",10,1,4,24 October 2018
Alice in Wonderland," Disappointment
","'Alice in Wonderland' by Lewis Carroll, directed by Tim Burton (whom I love), starring celebrities like Johnny Depp (whom I adore), Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway, Crispin Glover, Stephen Fry, Alan Rickman and legendary Christopher Lee, with technical capabilities of year 2010 and a $ 200 million budget ... You can not blame me for having high expectations. And when you see this wonder of wasted potential you won't blame me for being disappointed either.The film is visually impressive and I really have no complaints, but everything else is lousy. Tim Burton didn't really fail, but we all know that he can do it much much better. Mad Hatter is one of Depp's weakest roles, Mia Wasikowska is sweet and she played Alice quite decent, and only Helena Bonham Carter really made an impression on me. The story is cute but lousy, it's not boring, but it doesn't engage you as much as such adventure should. You will not have the urge to turn off the movie, but you will not be upset if you need to leave it in half. However, I'm not sure how much is that the fault of unimaginative screenwriter and director (it certainly isn't Carroll's fault), and how much is this actually result of this being Disney movie primarily intended for children, which imposes many limitations. But the fact that the film is intended for children is just an explanation, and not an excuse for a naive, shallow and too simple story. A quality movie for children should be multilayered, on the first glance simple enough to entertain children, but with a certain depth that will intrigue adults. This movie doesn't have that. If you are out of elementary school you're too old for this.6/10",6,0,0,29 August 2018

","It is quite probable that my objectivity is not on the level as I do not like either De Palma or Cruise. In my opinion, this is typical Hollywood crap, Tom Cruise trying to live his boyhood dream of being new 007. Unsuccessfully... The plot is kind of mannered and all twists and turns are predictable so the story wasn't interesting to me and there is no trace of tension or surprise factor. Music pretty much irritating, directing does not stand out, and acting... I don't know, maybe it is aversion towards Cruise talking, but I am incapable to see any of his characters. In his every movie I always see just same old featureless vacuous Tom Cruise. He had few decent movies back in 'Top Gun' time, but ever since... The only movie he did good (but still not great) job was 'Interview With a Vampire'. And the only De Palma's movie I really appreciate is 'Carlito's Way'. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this even to action fans, because even within the action genre it is not above average.6/10",6,0,2,10 December 2016

Story is strong, twists are excellent, and torture and gore scenes are carefully measured, purposefully placed and they do not cross the line of tastelessness at any point. Surprise factor has big role in this movie and knowing how movie ends spoiled it to me pretty much. If you didn't see it yet, I strongly recommend you to avoid trailers, reviews and any other potential spoilers.

","The first animated film to have the honor of opening the Cannes Festival. Ranked 120th on IMDb Top 250, Metascore 88, won two out of five Oscar nominations... It's good, but is it truly that good?The story of an elderly widower who, after the death of his wife, embarks on an adventure to pursue their shared childhood dream, and learns something about himself and the true values of life. The story is well-written, emotional and laced with humorous moments, but it did not leave a particularly strong impression on me. The animation is good, with an interesting use of color, but nothing breathtaking. Everything in this movie is very good, but not great. Other than two completely unnecessarily cruel scenes (miscarriage and death of the main villain), I have nothing specific to complain about. But the movie just didn't move me. It amused me and is a handy choice if you want to watch something with younger children, but I believe soon I won't remember it at all.7/10",7,0,0,26 January 2020

Groundhog Day," More than just a comedy
","The cult film by Harold Ramis tells the story about a TV reporter who relives the same day over and over again for years, until true love breaks this endless loop. At first glance, this is just another romantic comedy, that will relax, endear you and make you laugh, but with every new watching, more and more I realize the multilayeredness and depth of its story. 'Groundhog Day' is a philosophical study of human nature and life, subtly packaged in the form of excellent comedy, with a rarely well-written script, which has picked up a bunch of awards and nominations. It's a shame that it's not even nominated for an Oscar. I rarely watch movies more than once or twice, but this one I have seen at least ten times and I will re-watch it at least as many times.9/10",9,2,3,11 July 2019
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," 'The one true anarchy is that of power'
","'Salò' was directed by the notorious Italian poet, novelist, painter, and film-maker Pier Paolo Pasolini, who was murdered before it was released. The art house film was based on a work '120 Days of Sodom' by the notorious Marquis de Sade, to depict the short-lived, lakeside republic of Salo in Nazi-controlled Northern Italy at the close of WWII. There, four ruling fascist officials, in a secluded chateau near Marzabotto, rounded up a group of adolescent boys and girls and subjected them to one hundred and twenty days of physical, mental and sexual torture.When I saw this movie for the first time, it was without competition, the single sickest movie I have ever seen. The movie is extremely disgusting, but it has something that made me see it through to the very end. Since then, I have seen much worse than that, but this one is the only of its kind that made me re-watch it a few more times. It is the most impressionable one in the long run.6/10",6,0,1,23 June 2019
Total Recall," 'Baby, you make me wish I had three hands'
","In its time, 'Total Recall' was heavily hyped and it earned cult status almost overnight. It must be admitted - quite deserved. The story is good, it is greatly shot and directed, and the effects are spectacular for 1990. On top of that add the sex bomb Sharon Stone and one of the greatest action heroes of all time, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and success is guaranteed. Even thirty years later, the movie is not as outdated as it could be expected. However, some decisions were, in my opinion, a mistake. As much as Schwarzenegger was a great advertisement at the time, I think the film would be much better with some quality actor in the lead role. Schwarzenegger simply makes it too silly, which this adaptation of Philip K. Dick certainly does not deserve. In addition, the chemistry between him and any of the main actresses is flat zero. Sharon, on the other hand, nailed her role, and thanks to this performance she got a chance to play in the 'Basic Instinct', which secured her glory. The other thing that bothered me is the too obvious violation of the laws of physics in order to squeeze as many spectacular effects as possible. When people find themselves on the airless surface of Mars they begin to distort as if they were going to explode. While this definitely looks interesting, and, with the three-breasted prostitute, it is one of the scenes that will forever remain in your memory, in reality, they would simply and completely unspectacularly suffocate. But let's attribute this to artistic freedom, because this is a sci-fi action and its aim is primarily to entertain, and that definitely works.7,5/10",7,0,1,11 January 2019

But it's not. 'Pretty Woman' is a cult classic of the genre that marked the nineties and one of those unforgettable movies that you can't help but love. Julia earned an Oscar nomination, she and Gere have incredible chemistry and charisma, and the great atmosphere of the film is further enhanced by music that includes Red Hot Chili Peppers, Bowie, Robert Palmer, Natalie Cole, Vivaldi's 'The Four Seasons', Roxette, and Roy Orbison's legendary song 'Pretty Woman ' after which the film was named.7/10",7,1,1,23 June 2020

","I saw first movie when it was released, before I registered on IMDb and started to rate and comment movies. It stayed in good memory and I know I had good time watching it, but I don't remember it well enough to be able to evaluate it and comment more specifically. I have the impression that the sequel is somewhat weaker, but it keeps pace with the first. If you expect complex characters and a powerful story you won't find it here. This is entertaining SF adventure, packed with action and hilariously funny moments. If you watch it as a serious movie, then it will be bad for you, but if you look at it as an action comedy then it's great. The end was bit disappointing because they made it more serious than the rest of the movie and humor is what gives this film the strength.

The answer is - Obviously longer than common sense allows. The movie was blockbuster, it launched the song 'Eye of the Tiger' in unbelievable heights, and it achieved crazy success in every way. However crazy it may sound, rearranging of the Rocky story works and it works well. The story is good, acting and directing too, the soundtrack kicks ass, and the movie keeps attention from the first till the very last moment, and it really leaves a strong impression.

","On the cinema screen, this visually impressive movie will leave you breathless, but when you watch it at home, on your TV, you will realize that its greatness is just an illusion. This sci-fi action brings an interesting, but simple and naive story, about intrigues at the court of the Nordic 'gods' and their impact on our world, and represents Thor's 'origins' movie. It relies almost entirely on high-budget production, special effects, and celebrities, and if stripped of all those fancy clothes, there's not much left to enjoy. above mentioned celebrities are Anthony Hopkins as Odin, Natalie Portman, Kat Dennings, Clark Gregg, Idris Elba, and Rene Russo. I didn't mention Thor and Loki deliberately because, although they nailed these roles, before this film those two weren't famous actors.

The oldest R-rated movie can also be found on the lists of the most controversial films because, in its time, it was something new and shocking. Frankly, I was a little bored. Although technically well-made, with great camera, music, and performances by Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh, the story and overall atmosphere made no special impression on me. The introductory part, until Marion arrives at the motel, was needlessly dragged on for half an hour and, after hundreds of watched thrillers and horrors, neither did the rest of it particularly hold my attention.

The Green Mile," 'I've done some things in my life I'm not proud of, but this is the first time I've ever felt in real danger of hell.'
","I usually comment on movies right after watching them, while still under strong impressions. Of course, provided that the film does leave impressions. Movies over two hours I watch in halves, two days in a row, or even thirds, in case they are extremely long and slow-paced. Also, I tend to 'rewind'. I often watch certain scenes two or more times, whether to understand them better or simply because I like them. I take breaks to search the Internet for answers to questions that pop into my head (Where have I seen this actor before? When did this guy die? What exactly does this word mean?), to make screenshots of powerful cadres, write a note in the skeleton of future review, do something that comes to mind and I'm afraid I'll forget if I don't do it right away...'The Green Mile' lasts over three hours. It flew by faster than a sitcom episode. I saw it in one breath, without a single 'rewinding' or pausing, without even blinking. Without a single thought unrelated to the movie. I don't remember the last time a movie caught my attention like this, and when it ended, I was left speechless. Even now, a day later, I am unable to write anything analytical about it. The technical aspects are excellent, but essentially irrelevant. I would only like to mention the performance of Michael Clarke Duncan, which was so convincing and full of emotional charge that he repeatedly brought tears to my eyes. The story this movie tells, the message and the emotion it conveys, are enough to make this film fully deserving of its reputation and its high place on the list of the best films of all time, side by side with 'The Shawshank Redemption'. If I recall correctly, King himself stated that this film is the most faithful adaptation of one of his novels. And when it comes to adaptations of Stephen King, we can divide them into two groups - Frank Darabont's adaptations and all the other adaptations that, compared to Darabont's, can only go to the corner to be ashamed of themselves (with the exception of Kubrick's 'The Shining' and Reiner's 'Misery').10/10",10,1,2,30 July 2019

Dark Shadows," 'Ugliest woman I've ever seen'
","After centuries of captivity, Barnabas Collins, a vampire, returns home to Collinsport to regain his cursed family's glory. The film is based on the series of the same name from the 1960s, replacing the more serious and darker tone of the original with typically Barton's humor and fairy-tale atmosphere. Vampires, werewolves, witches, and ghosts are never outdated, especially not when played by Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Helena Bonham Carter, Eva Green, Jackie Earle Haley, and Chloë Grace Moretz, with cameo appearances by Christopher Lee and Alice Cooper.8/10",8,0,0,23 March 2020

Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," The first feature-length cartoon
","The first feature-length animated film that laid the foundation stone for Disney company and the genre itself. If this movie failed Disney company probably would never get off the ground and dozens of masterpieces would never see light of day. It is questionable if we would even have this genre today. The success of this movie encouraged other companies to take this path and enrich childhoods of many generations.The movie was made in four years, two million $ was spent, and it made a profit of around 200 million and won a bunch of awards. A masterpiece of art that laid the foundation of a new genre, resisted the test of time and to this day it keeps its place at the top of best movies of all times. Despite the progress of technology, even after 80 years, few cartoons reached this level. These days cartoons are not made by hand and the production process is much faster and easier, but movies are mostly tragically bad. That's sad. By today's standards I would give it 8/10, but considering that it was handmade 80 years ago and influence it has on everything that came after, even 10/10 is not enough.And of course, we must not forget fantastic songs led by 'Heigh-Ho'.",8,2,2,2 November 2016

","'The Lion King' is one of the best known and most respected Disney movies. On IMDb it's in top 50, Metascore 83, 93% on Rotten Tomatoes... I don't know... it seems a bit too much to me. The film is very good and I do not have any specific objections, but it did not delight me. To animated characters voices are lent by the pretty powerful cast, which includes Rowan Atkinson, Jeremy Irons, Whoopi Goldberg, James Earl Jones, Cheech Marin, and others, and several songs from the movie were deservedly nominated for an Oscar, from which one won it. Still, from today's perspective, I would rate it seven, but when it came out, and I was a kid, I was thrilled, and for 1994, it has an enviable animation, so I will give it a compromise eight.8/10",8,0,0,20 April 2019

The Shawshank Redemption," 'Geology is the study of pressure and time. That's all it takes, really. Pressure... and time. That and the big goddamn poster.'
","Many believe that the IMDb Top 250 list is quite bad and unrealistic. I partially agree. The trouble is that cult classics, that have passed the test of time, are mixed with the latest blockbusters that enjoy enormous but only temporary popularity. Many of these films have a high rating due to strong marketing and internet hype, and will disappear altogether within a few months or maybe a few years, but I think that the positions of the films that have been on the list for more than a decade, with little variation or without any, pretty much reflect their real quality. 'The Shawshank Redemption' deserves the first place it holds.To me, this movie is just perfect. Great camera, masterful directing, a pace that makes two and a half hours simply fly by, top actors and their performances, well-integrated music, and most importantly Darabont's excellent adaptation of the King's story, make this film a timeless masterpiece. This prison story found the perfect balance between drama and humor, sadness and joy, alienation and friendship, malice and empathy, terror and hope. It can be viewed as an interesting adventure with a great plot twist, but also as a metaphor for life in general. 'The Shawshank Redemption' was nominated for seven Oscars, it is at or near the top of almost every list of best films of all time, it's Freeman's favorite own film, King's favorite adaptation of his own story, by far the best adaptation of King and, if not the best, certainly one of the best movies of all time. I saw it several times and not once have I been able to write about it right after watching. It simply leaves me speechless every single time.10/10",10,0,0,15 November 2018
Parasite," 'With no plan, nothing can go wrong'
","Metascore 96, IMDb Top Rated Movies #26, higher than ' The Green Mile', 'LÃ©on', 'The Usual Suspects', 'C'era una volta il West', 'Django Unchained', 'The Shining', 'A Clockwork Orange', even '2001: A Space Odyssey'... Oscars for Best Picture (first one ever for a film that's not in English), directing and screenplay and Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival... close to five hundred nominations and awards... I honestly don't get it.The movie really is good, but in any of the categories I could possibly classify it, it wouldn't be at the top. I came across comments that the film successfully combines almost all genres. I don't know what they were watching, but I was watching a morbid drama about a 'con-artist' family and social stratification. Comedy, thriller, horror, ... were we watching the same movie. And if someone asked me to recommend him a good South Korean movie, I don't think, in a few months, this one would even come to my mind at all. In a similar fashion, I would probably recommend 'Oldeuboi,' which, although I saw it a couple of years ago and gave it a seven, I remember as I saw it yesterday. And regardless of the genre, the first association with a South Korean film would definitely be 'A Moment to Remember.'I'm not saying it's not worth a look. Those who love well-shot sickness and modern South Korean cinema should definitely not miss it, but I certainly won't re-watch it.And finally, one question - does the movie's title refer to the Kim family or the Park family ?! I think this is an interesting topic to think about. I guess the author meant poor fraudsters, but from my perspective, their employers are essentially bigger parasites.7,5/10",7,2,2,5 May 2020
Prometheus," Nothing special
","If I understood right, this is Alien Origins movie, a prequel to the Alien franchise. It has the same feeling like Alien movies, but if you expect one more Alien movie you'll be disappointed. About half of the movie is introduction without much ongoing, while the majority of the action is placed in the last few minutes. Light SF adventure without horror elements we got used to in previous Alien movies. Visually well done, without many flaws, but also without special qualities. If you saw all the other movies in the franchise you should see this one too, it's not a waste of time, but if you skip it you won't miss anything special. I liked it, but I surely won't see it ever again.7/10",7,0,2,11 October 2017
Halloween," It may be the first, but it doesn't make it good
","'Halloween' from 1978 is a cult horror by John Carpenter, movie considered to be the first slasher horror and one of the most influential movies of all time. With all due respect, this does not automatically make it a good movie. This is Jamie Lee Curtis' debut movie, the movie that made her famous and one of the stupidest and the most boring movies I have ever seen. It practically doesn't have a story, characterization is also nonexistent, and complete lack of motivation makes Michael Myers one of the most unconvincing movie villains. The movie has no depth, no tension, and it is not scary either.One reason to watch this film could be the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis is extremely hot. She changed a little over the decades, but her specific sex appeal and sensibility fits her better in her forties and fifties than in her youth. As she is buttoned up to the neck all the time, this reason falls apart. On top of that, she is a lousy screamer.The only good thing in this movie is Carpenter's simple but eerie high-pitched melody, that became one of the most famous themes in the history of horror, or even movie melodies overall.5/10",5,5,10,20 October 2018
Wonder Woman," Nice movie for kids and terrible for DC fans
","It's really hard for me to rate this movie. If I start detail analysis of everything wrong with it I'll spend half a day on bashing and I have o go to work in half an hour. First, this is school example of lazy screenwriting. The story is dumb linear, full of holes and illogicalities and characters are terribly developed, without any background or evolution during the movie, which is unacceptable for an origin story. Gal Gadot is perfect for the role, but her acting is artificial and it looks like she poses for every scene. Like if the accent isn't on portraying WW character in the best possible way, but they want to decoy us and draw our attention from bad movie to Gal's unbelievable beauty and skills. Amount of slow motion in action scenes is so excessive that after some time it goes from ridiculous to tragic. I had a feeling like I'm watching ballet adaptation of comic-book on Fashion channel. Special effects are not bad, but it could be done better and more convincing. This looks more like animated than a feature film. Also, in some scenes, it is more than obvious they violently refrained from natural development of the scene only to stay within PG-13 at any cost. If I go into details I could do this for hours. And then again, Gal Gadot is magical, hypnotizing. There are some beautiful scenes and few funny moments. Although I could list its flaws for hours and I have almost no compliments for this movie, I really enjoyed watching it. Briefly, catastrophe, but really entertaining one.7/10Objectively, I would give it 5/10, but it would be hypocritical to rate so low movie that I will most probably watch again. Cause, in spite of its flaws I liked it pretty much.",7,2,8,13 September 2017
Carrie," Sissy, sweet nightmare
","In the '70s, 'Carrie' was a show worth your money. By today's standards, it is not a horror movie at all. But horror isn't the point of this movie anyway. King goes much further than the simple scaring of the audience. 'Carrie' is a primarily sad and heavy drama about an unhappy childhood, while supernatural aspects of the story and horror ending just serve the purpose of amplifying the drama. Mother, religious fanatic, was much more convincing to me in the 2013 remake, but Sissy Spacek really nailed her part. Although the movie does not give us enough time and background to get to know her well enough, Sissy's performance is so real and convincing that she transfers her emotions to the audience from the very beginning of the movie. We feel her sadness, her loneliness, her fears, her anger. When other kids mistreat her we want to kill them all. And at the end of the movie, that sweet shy little creature transforms into a frightening monster. Makeup cannot do that transformation on its own. Sissy nailed it. She is so creepy and scary at the end that she established herself as one of the most terrifying nightmares in horror movies history. Still, I prefer the remake.7/10 [10/10 for Sissy]",7,0,0,1 November 2016

It brings background information about the characters we watched in the trilogy and tells the story about how it all started. The story is good, but written in a way that is not especially interesting. As for the technical aspect, we all know what to expect from Marvel production, and on that side I really have no complaints, but even visually film did not impress me (though I believe that it would have left a stronger impression if I saw it at the theater) and overall, it was on the verge of boring.

","This movie pleasantly surprised me.

Black Panther," Good, but not great
","Marvel adheres to a tested recipe - 'If you've found a winning combination, stick to it.' They string high-budget action blockbusters one after another, maintaining the level with small variations. There are no masterpieces, but there are no failures either. Although I understand why they do it, personally, I don't like that approach, because all their movies follow same pattern and resemble each other. Without risk, there's no danger of failure, but there's no opportunity to make a really good movie either.'Black Panther' is visually stunning, fast-paced and entertaining. The combination of tribal features and futuristic costumes and technology is in perfect balance and the landscapes of Wakanda are beautiful, while the action scenes are directed to leave you breathless. The acting is good, but the characters and the story itself could be much better developed. Rather than to provide a good script, and then take advantage of big budgets and modern technology to make this story as impressive as possible, I think that Marvel films are based solely on the visual spectacle, leaving the story in the background.I watched the movie in the theater and I'm not sorry, I enjoyed it and had a good time. But I believe that in a couple of days I will not remember what the film was about, which is happening to me with almost every Marvel film.7/10",7,3,6,19 March 2018
Iron Man," Marvel's answer to Nolan's 'Batman Begins'
","Tony Stark was like - if Bruce Wayne can do it, I can do it too. And inspired by Robocop and Transformers he did it, and he did it better. In my opinion, Iron Man is not a superhero. He has no super-powers, but only huge amounts of money put into weapon development and high education in technology. His personality is more of an anti-hero rather than super-hero. But it doesn't make him any less interesting. On the contrary, this is one of my favorite Marvel films. Action SF thriller with excellent pace and well-measured balance of action, drama and humor, which will hold your attention from the beginning to the end, without oscillation in quality. The story is nicely developed, with well-written dialogues and witty remarks, great acting, and fantastic effects. Robert Downey Jr. gave a good performance as the Iron Man, perfect as Tony Stark, he has good chemistry with Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges don't even need to be commented on, and it is unfortunate that his character isn't better developed. And after the great movie, end credits are followed by the song of the same name, by legendary Black Sabbath. Delight :D8/10",8,0,0,4 June 2018
Blade Runner," Review for 'The Final Cut (2007)'
","Loose adaptation of Philip K. Dick's 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' had six different versions, until in 2007 'The Final Cut' was released. This seventh version allowed Ridley Scott to finally get the film closest to his original vision, without test audiences and studio pressures twisting it. I won't go into differences between versions and reasons why there's so many of them, because I didn't see them all and you can always google it.'Blade Runner' is one of those movies that should be seen in theater. It's made for big screen and you can't fully experience its visual magnificence by watching it at home. It would also be blasphemy to use lousy plastic speakers while watching this piece of art, not only because of Vangelis's music, but because overall excellent sound.Story develops in 2019, when nature is destroyed, human race colonized outer space and androids are used as slaves. The last generation of androids are almost undistinguishable from humans in body and mind, so there's a risk that they develop emotions and become unpredictable and dangerous. For that reason they are given life span of only four years and they are forbidden on Earth. Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Brion James and Joanna Cassidy are four of such Replicants who killed bunch of people, hijacked a ship and came to Earth to find their maker, in hope he could stop them from dying in four years. Harrison Ford is Blade Runner, member of special police unit whose job is to track Replicants on Earth and kill them on sight. Both sides, from their own point of view, have justified causes for their actions, so even if Blade Runner is our leading character you are meant to root for, if you put yourself in Replicant's shoes you'll realize that they didn't have much of a choice and you would probably do the same in their place. Movie doesn't serve all answers on a silver plate, some things are left to us to interpret and it opens some moral questions that will make you think.Performances of all actors are great, characters are very convincing, Sean Young and Harrison Ford have nice chemistry, and overall atmosphere achieved by Scott and Vangelis is stunning. Based on audio-visual magnificence and essential issues it deals with, 'Blade Runner' could be compared to Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968) and Kubrick's and Spielberg's cooperation 'Artificial Intelligence' (2001), and I think it's safe to say those are three greatest SF movies made to this day. If you are interested in A.I. subgenre of SF, I would, beside these three, also recommend Spike Jonze's 'Her' (2013) and Chris Columbus 'Bicentennial Man' (1999). I must emphasize that last two are in my top five only because of their story, while in every other aspect they are far below any comparison with first three.10/10",10,1,3,18 February 2018

Trainspotting," The best drug addiction movie
","I want to see as many as possible and that's why I rarely repeat movies, but some movies one simply has to watch over and over again. 'Trainspotting' is one of those. With 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' (1998) and 'Requiem for a Dream' (2000) it makes a 'holy trinity' of drug addiction movies. While I really can not stand the first two, 'Trainspotting' is real masterpiece in every way. Story is adapted from cult novel of the same name by Irvin Welsh, about Mark Renton, heroin addict from Edinburgh, and his low-life friends. Although at no time does it condemn drug addiction directly, the film shows the life of addicts in a way that is much more effective than any moralizing. The story is fast paced, full of crazy and surreal situations, unforgettable scenes, black humor, and phenomenal dialogue and monologues. Great acting, original directing and one of the best soundtracks of all time.

","I leading roles - Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny! How could anyone resist this announcement... In 1996, this movie was a miracle that, even without the internet, caused big hype. I loved it as a kid, and now, two decades later, I didn't enjoy any less.An amusement park, somewhere far away in space, begins to decline in attendance and the owner has to provide new attractions to stay in business. He decides to go to Earth and kidnap Warner's cartoon characters. The fate of the Looney Tunes will be decided by a basketball game against aliens, and desperate toons are calling for help from Michael Jordan.Story is classic Looney Tunes cartoon combined with feature film. Beside probably every Warner animated character and Michael Jordan, there are few more NBA players and genius comedians Wayne Knight and Bill Murray. From today's perspective, the film is technically rather outdated, but even if you are not able to look at it from the perspective of the time in which it originated, its speed, humor and a lot of interesting details and references (which you have no chance to catch all during a single viewing) leave you no time to bother with technical shortcomings. I also particularly liked the music (Seal, R. Kelly, Salt-N-Pepa, Technotronic, 2 Unlimited), which objectively might not be that great, but in me, who grew up in nineties, it woke up some nostalgia and its specific atmosphere put me in the right mood to enjoy this wacky film.8/10",8,1,1,24 March 2018

Audio-visually the movie did not disappoint, but the story itself was really lousy. It is probably pretty good for pre-teen children, but to me, it was quite boring.

","The movie is based on the ancient concept of expansion of consciousness. A human mind is limited by ego barriers and our own personality stops us from seeing the bigger picture. If we could get over obstacles we set up to ourselves, and we started to expand our consciousness further and further, at some point we would merge with collective consciousness, namely, we would become one with God.

I was never disappointed so far, but with big expectations one cannot be easily amazed either. Director Jean- Pierre Jeunet already amazed me with fantastic post-apocalyptic surreal romantic dark-humored horror drama 'Delicatessen' from 1991, then disappointed me with the 4th sequel in 'Alien' franchise, and then he made an amazing comeback with 'Amélie'... If I didn't see 'Delicatessen', I could not believe this movie was made by the same person responsible for 'Alien 4' failure.The story, acting, camera, colors, music... complete atmosphere left me speechless. At the same time intense and relaxed, cheerful and sad, smart and silly, this film turns everyday life into a fairy-tale. I was not just entertained. However stupid it may sound, while I was watching this movie I was truly deeply happy and I cannot recall any movie ever did that to me.10/10",10,0,2,13 March 2017

","Movies that save twist and surprise for the end are usually very effective for the first watching, but once you know the ending those movies lose their strength and stop being interesting. This one is an exception. Knowledge how the movie will end did not make the second watching boring. Quite the opposite, it made me want to watch this movie a few more times. Every few years I gladly get back to it and every time I discover some new details and experience it a bit different. Also, during every session, I am trying to find its flaws and holes, but so far I failed to notice any mistakes. A deeply emotional, slightly creepy, only seemingly linear, movie that provokes reflections on essential topics of life that bustle patterns of everyday life constantly sweep under the carpet. I am too biased to say if this movie is really one of the masterpieces of all time, but it surely is a great movie and definitely one of my favorites.10/10",10,1,3,24 December 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Haters will hate, no cure for that :)
","I spent last half an hour reading first few dozens of reviews on IMDb. Every single one was bashing with rate from 1/10 (big majority) to maximum 4/10. Still, average rating on that same IMDb is 8,1. Conclusion - movie is not at all that bad as they wanna show it. Haters are minority, but all haters have unbearable urge to bash everything they lay their eyes on, while the rest of us who liked the movie and who are in huge majority, mostly do not care to write reviews. To be completely honest, most of their arguments against this movie are hard as a rock, it's all facts, but the final result is not bad movie at all. Haters claim this is is plagiarism of original trilogy. True, movie has one of the most appalling lack of originality I have ever seen, but I prefer to consider it reboot of the original trilogy rather than plagiarism. Yes, they made it to get some more money on old fame and, yes, everything in it we saw before, but still it is nicely done and very entertaining movie. Maybe I fell on targeted nostalgia they cunningly used, but I really really enjoyed this show from the beginning to the very end. I simply loved it.7,5/10",7,23,47,6 March 2017

RED," 'Your eyes are so beautiful'
","DC pulls more towards dark dramas, while Marvel strings action blockbusters that border with comedy. This time, DC beat Marvel on their ground. Although it is based on the graphic novel and it has traces of comic-book attributes, 'RED' (Retired: Extremely Dangerous) doesn't have a comics-like atmosphere. It is an action-comedy with elements of romance, which is so entertaining and funny that the only reason I did not watch it in one breath was that I was constantly rewinding the scenes to see them again. Action scenes are well-staged, and the editing and effects do not lag behind. There are also great music and a totally awesome cast. Bruce Willis is, as usual, an irresistible charmer, whose character is called Moses and he's something between McClane from 'Die Hard' and Jimmy from 'The Whole Nine Yards'. Mary-Louise Parker is luscious and has perfect chemistry with Willis. And when their support are legends such as Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Brian Cox, Helen Mirren, and Richard Dreyfuss, there is no doubt about the quality of the acting.<ul><li>You know, if it is the CIA, then there's only one place we can go to find out why they're coming after us.

Rear Window," Overrated...?
","The more I watch Hitchcock and the more I compare my impressions with the reviews of other people, the more I start to think that maybe I do not like his style. I love the genre he works with and I appreciate him very much, but either the most reviewers are following the hype and rating his movie too high because that's expected from 'true cinephiles' or I simply don't get him the way most people do. I saw 16 of his movies so far and my average rating is 6,9 which places him slightly above average. 'Rear Window' is a perfect example. It is considered to be one of the best films of all time, but to me, it's nothing special. I have no objections to it thou, but I do not see what's there to praise so much. Good movie, but not the great one and definitely overrated.7/10",7,1,3,23 August 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The Lord of the Rings (2001-2003)
","'One Ring to rule them all,
One Ring to find them,
One Ring to bring them all
And in the darkness bind them'Tolkien's 'The Lord of the Rings' is a book that has introduced me to the world of epic fantasy and, while no longer in the top of my favorites, will forever hold a special place in my heart. I will never forget how I eagerly awaited this movie trilogy, as well as the thrill of the movies when I first saw them in the cinema. And with each new viewing, enjoyment is no less. Although I don't like movies this long, the twelve hours of 'The Lord of the Rings' just fly by.It is far from being the perfect movie, as many seem to perceive it. I find many changes to the book to be unnecessary hollywoodization. Elijah Wood never felt right in the role of Frodo, and his latently gay relationship with Sam will never stop poking my eyes. It may be up to me, but I've never experienced it in a book. There are a lot more of all sorts of minor complaints, but in spite of them, the overall impression of this epic trilogy in every respect is an unforgettable experience. A very well adapted story, camera, directing and effects that take your breath away, mostly excellent cast choices and ingeniously blended music that greatly enhances the already perfect atmosphere, make this film a masterpiece of the genre and, in my opinion, one of the best film achievements of all time.10/10",10,0,0,2 April 2020
The Purge," Disappointing
","Performance of Cersei Lannister and the crew is good. Inner struggle between self-preservation and conscience is convincing. Directing and sound are very good and movie is very suspense. But story itself is retarded. Original it is, but originality at any cost does not worth much. Even if we take basic premise for granted, without thinking and analyzing, behavior of leading characters is painfully stupid. Story is full of holes and illogicality that lower potentially great movie to below average level. With all good will I can squeeze from myself I can not rate it over5/10SPOILER ALERT<ul><li>Main characters became rich selling security systems, which means they benefited of Purge and it suits them. But if they already have all that money, why the hell they do not go abroad on vacation in that time of year and avoid any risk?! They could even emigrate to wherever they wish once they have enough money. But no, they stay in America to risk their lives every year. </li></ul><ul><li>Five people, however clumsy they may be, in their own home, could easily ambush dozen invaders, who enter unknown territory, without too much risk for themselves. But instead they first reduce their numbers by sending two teenagers in the basement and leaving homeless man strapped to chair. Probably because two have better odds than five... OK, I can understand leaving children out of trouble, but damn, homeless guy is war veteran who is more skilled in combat then the rest of them together. So instead of fighter and two nerds they go with just two nerds. And after all those mistakes they do not ambush invaders but they start to walk around the house, not even protecting each others back, giving invaders opportunity to ambush them. No one with at least one brain cell would do something that stupid. Normal person would gather all five in one room with one door, arm themselves as much as possible, point all guns to that one way in, and shoot at everything that moves.</li></ul><ul><li>There's more, but even this two things alone prove my point, so I won't bother to continue.

A Nightmare on Elm Street," Introducing Johnny Depp
","When I first watched this masterpiece of the genre, I was not at all a fan of horror. What's more, I did not watch horror at all, and I decided to see this film solely because of Johnny Depp. I saw all of his films and Johnny's film debut was the only one left. I was avoiding it for a long time because it was a horror, but in the end I could not resist. When I finally saw it, I had to see the second one, then the third... and I was hooked. Love was born to the horrors of the eighties, and then to the genre in general.Many mistakenly believe that the greatest human fear is the fear of death. The fear of death is just one aspect of the really greatest human fear - fear of the unknown. Dreams are still a mystery to us. We do not understand them and we have no control over them, so the horror based on dreams is a very effective idea. Horrors based on impossible premises, no matter how well designed, have no effect on me. But when there is even a trace of suspicion that the premise could be possible (of course, not exactly in this form), combined with masterful skills of Wes Craven and the credible cast, led by Robert Englund, as one of the most awesome film villains of all time, we get a movie that maintains tension from the beginning to the end, and you will be at least a bit uncomfortable the next couple of nights while you are about to fall asleep. And if you are still a child, get ready for a few months of nightmares.10/10",10,2,3,21 August 2018
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," 'Here lies Keanu Reeves. He played Ted.'
","For years after the release of this movie, Keanu Reeves had been moaning that his epitaph would sound like this, because, after seeing 'Bill and Ted', people saw Ted in his every subsequent role. I'm not one of those, because if I were, I would like him much more. As much as he has irritated me in most films, I have to admit that here he has played a dumb teenager fantastically and is unexpectedly likable and funny.Bill and Ted are high school students who want to start a rock band, but because of their dullness and laziness, they are threatened with expulsion from school. If that happens, Ted will go to a military boarding school and there will be no band. Their last hope is that they deserve the highest marks in a history presentation. George Carlin comes to the rescue, in the role of a man from a future, sent to allow Bill and Ted to travel through time, to explore historical figures firsthand, and the crazy adventure begins.The movie has no particular objective qualities and, in cold blood, I would rate it maybe some five out of ten, but I can't ignore the fact that I had a great time and was genuinely laughing at times, so I can't go below7/10",7,1,2,23 December 2019
The Matrix," 'To deny our own impulses is to deny the very thing that makes us human'
","Machines have subdued people and now use them as bio-batteries, packed in containers on huge energy farms and connected to Matrix, software that keeps human minds in a false reality in which everything is as it used to be. Relatively small resistance, in constant flight from hunter machines, at will enters and leaves Matrix, looking for a chosen one who, once freed from illusion, will take over the leadership over free men and defeat the machines.I finally decided to give a chance to famous The Matrix Trilogy. Not all at once of course, I'm not a masochist. Even two hours straight of Keanu Reeves is at the edge of too much. First one is not nearly as good as it's popular, but I must admit that it is good.7/10",7,0,3,23 March 2017
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," May the Force be with you
","Episodes I and II have 6,5 on IMDb, III has 7,7 and this one has almost 9. I don't understand. Maybe I am not able to see things from the '70s perspective, I was not even born back then, but from my point of view, all four I saw so far are on more or less same level, slightly above average movies. I'm giving 7 to all of them. I just have to acknowledge one thing as first time viewer. If I didn't know anything about this franchise before watching it, it is possible that I wouldn't even notice two-decade space between trilogies. Sure, when you see 3 movies from the 21st century and then in the 4th sequel you see Harrison Ford as a youngster, it reveals pretty much, but other than that trilogies are perfectly blended.7/10",7,1,1,9 December 2018
Cloud Atlas," I have to read this book
","I'm not sure to what extent I understood this movie, or if it is at all possible to catch everything from just one watching, and I really want to understand it fully. I think it would be best if I read the book. Complete mindfak, but not in usual way of inexplicability or unpredictability, but because story, although pretty much explained, is extremely complex and told in very unusual and original way. Movie follows six stories at the same time, switching from one to another every few moments, so in the beginning you have a feeling like someone is terrorizing your TV remote. Situation is further complicated by fact that all stories are placed in completely different epochs, six unrelated locations, and they even differ by genres, but the same cast is acting six different group of characters in all stories. Makeup and costumes are so believable that in some cases I did not recognize some actors in all their roles until end credits, while in other cases it's obvious but still beautifully done. Some transformations are bit raped but I didn't mind. Some actors even have roles in both sexes. There are four Oscar winners: Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent and Susan Sarandon. At the beginning stories are seemingly unrelated, except for the cast of course, but as film progress, connections and coherence are more and more obvious, until at the end you realize that all stories make one rounded entirety, when even tragic moments gain meaning and make you smile. Whole construction is even more fascinating considering that stories are placed on 1849. boat, 1936. England, 1973. San Francisco, 2012. London, 2144. Seoul and 2311. post-apocalyptic Hawaii. Till today I never heard of this movie. I run into it by accident and I'm glad I did. This is one of rare examples of a movie that lasts 3 hours but holds attention strongly from beginning to the end. I warmly recommend it to everyone, regardless of your movie taste, because in this movie you can find overseas ship adventure, freeing of slaves, classical music, gay drama, intrigue, blackmail, 70's thriller, sex, violence, comedy, gore scenes, futuristic SF, post-apocalyptic tribal civilization, reincarnation, new worlds, romance and, well, everything you could possibly put in a movie.8,5/10",8,0,0,10 October 2017
Cube," Disappointment
","The amazing original idea which could have been used for making cult classic for all times. The idea that deserves 10/10 is by terrible realization degraded to average trash. Acting is mediocre and sociologically and psychologically movie is a complete failure. Characters are so two-dimensional that viewers cannot relate to them, therefore there's no fear, no tension, no emotions, nothing... There is a single scene that kept me on the edge of my chair, while everything else was just sad cliché. And, of course, the ending is lousy in every way.There's not much sense in making a quality remake, because originality is the main charm of this story, and this movie completely wasted that awesome idea. When the movie ended I felt sad and angry at the same time. The idea deserves 10/10, the realization is maybe 4/10, so we have a weak 7 movie out of what should have been 11/10 masterpiece...7/10",7,2,3,21 October 2016
Fantastic Four," I really enjoyed it
","Another unjustly bashed movie. Of course it is not masterpiece of cinematography, but it doesn't try to be.

Annihilation," Beautiful pretentious crap
","If you've watched the movie 'Ex Machina', you may notice that 'Annihilation' is the work of the same author. Although thematically they have nothing in common, the style of Alex Garland is quite recognizable. The movie has quite an original premise, or at least I've never encountered anything like this, and it is visually beautiful, therefore in the theater, it is probably breathtaking and diverts attention from the fact that it has nothing else to offer. Characterization, which in the previous film was Garland's main asset, here is almost non-existent, so the characters are unimpressive and do not provoke sympathy. 'Annihilation' is an SF drama-adventure with a touch of horror, but it is neither particularly dramatic, nor exciting, nor scary, yet it is full of holes and illogicality. I can not say I was bored, but with characters whose fate I did not care about and a story that did not keep me at the edge of my seat or woke up any emotions, it left me quite indifferent. There is a possibility that I did not understand the film, but it somehow seems to me that the problem is that the author himself did not have a concrete idea of what he wanted to achieve with this film, so he just let his imagination run wild without any particular goal, blurring the lack of essence, and even a common sense, by excellent cinematography.6,5/10",6,2,3,3 April 2019

Aladdin," Disney + Robin Williams = Timeless classic
","The US-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee protested over the pro-Western display of Aladdin and Jasmine, who is always without a veil, over the fact that all the characters with the turban are bald, and that all the villains are caricatured personifications of prejudices about the Arabs. But the fiercest protests were caused by a verse from the song 'Arabian Nights,' which opens the cartoon. The verse now reads 'Where it's flat and immense and the heat is intense, it's barbaric, but, hey, it's home'. In the original version, the verse read 'Where they cut off your ears if they don't like your face, it's barbaric, but, hey, it's home'. This provoked such an alarm that the film was placed among the most controversial achievements of all time.Personally, I find this information quite interesting, but totally irrelevant, because the animation is excellent, the music is beautiful, the story is quite solid, and the film that stars Robin Williams by default can not fail.8/10",8,0,0,5 May 2019
Sin City," Jessica is goddess <3
","'Sin City' is a neo-noir omnibus of four stories adapted from the comics of Frank Miller, directed by Rodriguez, Miller and Tarantino. Camera and directing mimic the style of comics. The film is in black-and-white technique, but some details are highlighted with bright colors (red blood, red lipstick, red dress, red sneakers, yellow monstrous blood and the like) whose contrast leaves a powerful impression and enhances the story. The cast is fantastic and packed with sexy (un)dressed beautiful women. Rosario Dawson, Benicio Del Toro, Carla Gugino, Josh Hartnett, Rutger Hauer, Michael Madsen, Frank Miller (writer, producer, director and actor in this movie), Brittany Murphy, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Elijah Wood,... Such a team gathered in the same movie is quite promising. When you see Jessica Alba dancing on the stage of striptease bar you'll completely forgot about Salma Hayek's performance in 'From Dusk till Dawn', and her chemistry with Bruce Willis is fascinating. An unforgettable experience that can be repeated many times. In my opinion, this is one of the greatest movies of all time.10/10",10,2,2,8 March 2018
Gangs of New York," Controversial
","Subjective tastes are very diverse and opinions of movie fans most often vary throughout the 1-10 scale, but in most cases majority agrees. However, there are movies that divide the audience into completely opposed groups of those who praise and those who bash the movie, with negligible few of those who rate it somewhere in between. When you scroll through the reviews for 'Gangs of New York' you can see either 1/10 bashing or 9-10/10 hymns. And all the arguing between those groups is in vain. They'll never agree. In this particular case, I'm with those who praise it. I am not able to prove the worth of this movie to you with facts. The magnificence of this movie is not in analyzing the objective quality of its components, it's in the overall impression it leaves. And I was very impressed. I won't go into the historical accuracy of this movie for two reasons: I do not know the facts and I absolutely do not care. I will not analyze the story-line or dialogues. The cast consists of a bunch of great and well-known actors that rarely fail, and based solely on their performances, especially Daniel Day-Lewis and Leonardo DiCaprio, as well as the overall visual impression, I rate this movie the strong8/10",8,4,5,27 August 2018
The Cabin in the Woods," Original cliché
","If you are a fan of art drama or you simply don't like the horror genre, I can understand if you hated this. But for every true fan of horror, with at least a basic knowledge of at least cult horrors through the history of the genre, this should be a real joy. 'The Cabin in the Woods' is a weird movie that can not be precisely genre determined. It gathers horror ideas seen countless times and turns them upside-down. Nothing in this movie is new, but the greatest thing about it is its ability to make something very original using totally outworn horror cliches. This is a parody and homage at the same time. It is a funny-scary movie with great visuals and even better dialogues and one-liners, and its pace and twists (even the predictable ones) will not let you get bored even for a minute. And the final revelation is at the same time one of the most ridiculous and one of the most awesome things I have ever seen on the big screen. It is not a masterpiece, but it is a real gem and I loved it.8/10",8,39,61,4 October 2018

","During the mating season, male and female Emperor penguins seduce each other with song. Until one day a penguin came into the world completely unable to sing, but an incredible talent for tap-dancing.The script is somewhat original, but it essentially delivers the good old story of growing up, of sticking out, of seeking your true self and the need to be accepted and loved. A story of genuine friendship, courage, and true love. Nothing new, but it doesn't make it any less wonderful. The powerful emotion this movie conveys from the start is complemented by good animation, a strong cast that gives voices to cartoon characters (Robin Williams, Brittany Murphy, Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman, ...) and a superb soundtrack (John Lennon, Stevie Wonder, Prince, Lionel Richie, ZZ Top, Elvis Presley, Freddie Mercury,...).The film won an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year and brought Prince the only Golden Globe of his career.

Great 15 years old actress who, although she made just a few movies since she was 13, was nominated for 6 best actress awards on various film festivals.

","A visually magnificent spectacular adrenaline ride. From the viewpoint of the camera, directing, set design, makeup, props and action, at the top of the genre, the music and the sound in general are fantastic, but from the point of the story rather thin and without much to do with the original trilogy. And without Gibson, that's not it. Tom Hardy is good, but he just can't replace him. Although I have to admit that the cast is really great, and the strongest impression on me was made by Nicholas Hoult (which is worrying when we take into account all those women...). Big recommendation, but I wouldn't watch it again.8/10",8,1,4,29 August 2019
Warcraft," Good, but not great
","To begin with, I have to say I'm not Warcraft fan. I played the game occasionally, but I never gave too much thought to it nor read anything related to this lore, so I'm not competent to say if movie is faithful to original story or not. But I am fan of epic fantasy and it's my favorite genre. The only thing that somewhat bothered me was that two hours is not nearly enough to tell this story proper. Fact that movie feels incomplete is acceptable, cause it is obvious this is just the base for movies that will follow and this franchise looks very promising. But even just introduction to this world can not fit in only two hours. It needs at least three hours, or even two movies for this part of the story to be told right. Beside that I have no other objections. It is very good movie. But they call it The Lord of the Rings for the new generation. That's where I must draw a line. However good this movie is it is not worthy to be even compared to LOTR. Not only it is blasphemy to say that Warcraft is better or equally good, but they are beyond any comparison. Even after fifteen years nothing came even close to LOTR, let alone overthrow it from the throne of the genre. Maybe this movie standing alone deserves higher rating than what I rated it, and if there was no LOTR maybe I would rate it much higher, but LOTR set standards so high for this genre and in every single aspect it so much better than Warcraft, that on the scale where LOTR is ten, I simply can not give this movie more than seven. Still, I warmly recommend this adventure to all genre lovers and I can not wait for the sequels.7/10",7,23,34,3 October 2017
Me Before You," Enjoyable, if you do not think about what you see...
","I've heard so much glorification of this movie, that I was eager to watch it as soon as possible and enjoy its magnificence, but then... disappointment on many levels. To be clear, this movie is not a crap, but it's just slightly different from high budget South- American soap opera with Hollywood production.Acting is satisfying, scenery and landscapes are sometimes breathtaking and production is on the level. That would be all I can commend.Story... This movie doesn't have 'o' of originality and it is predictable from opening scene to ending credits. There's no single surprise or twist. Everything in it has been already seen and thoroughly verified Hollywood clichÃ©s are carefully wrapped in decorative paper.Will is successful businessman from wealthy family who ends up in wheelchair after traffic accident. On that fateful day he would go to work on motorbike, but his wealthy and beautiful blonde stops him. Same second he gave up on his motorbike I was sure what will happen next. While he was crossing the street on his foot he was hit by, you won't believe this, motorbike. Of course, in this type of story, the one in wheelchair is usually male and rich and he hires someone poor to care for him. At the beginning he is cold and grumpy, but in time he starts to show his warmer side. Am I the only one who saw 'The Intouchables' ?! Slight touch of 'Beauty and the Beast' maybe ?! Though here we have poor girl that gave up on higher education to take care of her family, instead of black petty criminal. She irresistibly reminds me of 'Ugly Betty'...Wills relationship with his blonde falls apart after the accident and she marries his best friend. His new caretaker is seven years in relationship with egocentric sportsman until time with Will opens her eyes and she realizes she is not happy, so she falls in love with Will. Author is trying to catch us on cheap pathetic...Characterization is lousy. We see two-dimensional characters who are not well developed, not even close. How did Will win her love ?! What is that she falls for ?! Fact that he is good looking and rich ?! I doubt author had intention to send that message, but except for his looks and money we see no other positive sides of Will. She gets money from his parents and organizes luxury dates and travels in attempt to awake desire to live in Will... or maybe she provides herself a chance to experience things she could only dream about before she got access to his money... I understand what author wanted to present, but also I can not stop myself from seeing what's obvious. I did not make up any of this. I just point out the obvious.They go out, they travel exotic destinations, they fall in love. Will has good time with his new girl, she loves him unconditionally, he is offered to get back to his job, his family provides full support, and he is rich. But that's not worth living and he decides he should kill himself. Yes, he planned this way before he met her, but not even love of his life can change his decision. What message does it send to us ?!That people with disabilities are useless, dead burden to their surroundings, that they have nothing to give, professionally or emotionally, that good job, supporting family and true love are not worth living for ?! Somehow Stephen Hawking pops up in my mind...Sure, no one can stops you from killing yourself, but having health institution to help you ?! If you are in continuous unbearable pain and your life comes down just to pure survival in endless agony... then maybe.But let's ignore moral dilemmas and stay in limits of this movie. If you already decided to kill yourself and nothing, not even true love, can make you change your mind, why the hell did you mislead innocent girl, give her false hope and broke her long term relationship, just to make her sucker at the end and leaver her emotionally destroyed... That seem selfish and cruel to me.At wedding, on the dance floor, he openly admitted that before his accident he would never noticed girl like her, let alone fell in love with her. And after accident his life is so worthless that even their true love is not worth living. Somewhere I saw that perfectly put in one sentence. 'I cannot live and love you because I refuse to live and love as any other man than the man I was; however, if I were the man I was, I would not have loved you.' But she does not mind.And so on, they fall in love, the time has come to go, she gives up her believing and needs and escorts him on last voyage. Movie ends with epilogue. He is dead and he left her with fat bank account (and she did not even had to get married) and a letter that sends her to Paris, his favorite place on Earth, with detailed instruction where to go and what to look for. 'P.S. I Love You'... anyone ?!Don't get me wrong, movie is more than watchable. After reading my review you would probably think that 6/10 is too high. But if you avoid to analyze, just grab your popcorn and sit comfortably in your sofa to watch the screen with half a brain, you will enjoy two hours of stereotyped Hollywood romance drama, and maybe it will even make you laugh or cry once or twice...",6,1,3,17 October 2016
Donnie Darko," Mesmerizingly confusing
","This movie is hard to describe and even harder to explain and that's one of the main reasons I loved it. The other reasons are great visuals and an excellent cast led by young Jake Gyllenhaal, one of the best actors of today. But don't waste your time reading reviews. Go and see this awesome MF as soon as possible.8,5/10",8,0,0,1 October 2018
Pocahontas," Cute, but forgettable
","A very nice story with a lot of potential that this film wasted. The first half of the movie is slow-paced and boring, while everything is happening in the second half, so the story is quick and undeveloped. I have the impression that I've watched an introductory episode of a series rather than a complete rounded movie. Song 'Colors of the Wind' may have earned the Oscar that year (I do not know what was its competition), but music as a whole is below Disney's level. There aren't any catchy songs that once you've heard them you'll never forget. I finished this movie about 15 minutes ago and I already can't remember any of them. All in all, cute but forgettable.5,5/10",5,0,2,8 February 2018
Goodfellas," Great cast in a mediocre movie
","I saw a lot of mafia movies and they all are on the same mold. This one is no exception and to me, frankly, it was quite boring. Of course, it is possible that other films under this template are younger than 'Goodfellas' and that, if I saw them chronologically, this one would be more interesting, and the others that copy it would be boring. But 'The Godfather' was made almost twenty years before this film, so this theory does not hold water either. However, seven nominations and one won Oscar, baton in the hands of Martin Scorsese and the cast which is by no means inferior to that of 'The Godfather' rise this achievement above a bunch of similar ones. But as I rated 'The Godfather' an eight out of ten, I can not rate this one above7/10",7,1,2,2 July 2018
The Birds," The only good bird is a roasted bird
","I watched this on TV as a child and, although I forgot all the details a long time ago, it remained carved in my memory as terrifying. Of course, this memory was greatly influenced by its reputation as one of the most famous horrors of all time. I just watched it for the first time as an adult in its entirety and I must say - wtf?! The story is linear, simple and does not require even the slightest use of the brain. It starts as a typical romantic comedy of its time (and it would be better if it stayed that way to the end), and then turns into something that is supposed to be a horror, but it is at best a mediocre drama. There is no mystery and tension that we expect from Hitchcock, there are no interesting dialogues, and performances of the actors are at a rather low level. From today's perspective, the effects are tragicomic, and I believe they were not anywhere near top-notch even for their time, which leads to the question how the hell was this film nominated for an Oscar in that category. Occasionally, the effects were so ridiculous that I had the impression that someone deliberately mocked with bird attacks. This is a film from 1963, not from 1923. The events in the movie remain completely unexplained, but that didn't bother me much because I couldn't care less about the reasons for bird attacks. The only good thing about this movie is the premise itself, because it is relatively realistic. Considering the number of birds on the planet in relation to the number of people, the very idea that birds can turn against us and attack us all at once is horrifying, because, despite their primitiveness in relation to human technology, I believe that in this war mankind would have no chance to win. Ever since I can remember I felt moderate repulsion and disgust towards birds, and after this movie, however unconvincing it may be, I could easily develop a phobia. If this movie was of a more recent date, I would rate it even lower, but, considering technical capabilities of the sixties, I have to give it a slack, so I'll rate it5/10",5,1,1,17 September 2018
Beetlejuice," 'What's the good of being a ghost if you can't frighten people away?'
","The young married couple invested a lot of time, love and effort into renovating the house and turning it into a home of their liking. And then they died and left trapped in the house as ghosts. Soon the house got new, extremely irritating owners, so the ghosts decided to get rid of them. When it doesn't work for them, they hire an (un)professional exterminator of the living - Betelgeuse.This is only the second movie for Tim Burton, so the atmosphere he is known for is still evolving, but already recognizable. The story is for all ages, simple and tame enough for kids, but laced with jokes and references that make it interesting for adults. Burton has assembled a great cast. The lead roles are interpreted by Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, with Michael Keaton in the title role, while the irritating new tenants are played by Catherine O'Hara, Jeffrey Jones and then seventeen-year-old Jeffrey Jones.As a kid, I adored this movie. I can't criticize anything in particular, because, for its target audience and the time in which it was made, it is really well done. But from today's perspective, it is too tame and tepid to me and I don't see any praiseworthy qualities. An average fantasy comedy for a single viewing.6/10",6,0,1,22 November 2019
Alien: Covenant," Better than Prometheus
","Covenant is direct sequel to Prometheus, acting at the same time as origins movie and sequel, filling holes its predecessors left and rounding the franchise, but leaving more than enough space for new sequels to come. It's simultaneously slow and crowded, but everything works just fine. I'm not thrilled but I am very satisfied and, to me, it's better than Prometheus.7,5/10",7,1,3,27 October 2017

The Wizard of Oz," Movie that left mark on countless generations
","This is one of those movies that will last forever. Our grandmothers were watching it while they were just little girls and our grandchildren will enjoy it as much. Its values will never be outdated. One of those that define expression 'classic'. Only a shallow viewer could consider it to be just a fairy-tale for children, because this masterpiece is much more than that and its depth covers all generations. Although it's almost 80 years old it still resists the teeth of time, even visually. Its costumes and special effects are extremely outdated but still effective. I admit, it would be very interesting to see how it would all look like with today's technology, but I think this is one of those shrines that should not be touched.10/10",10,8,8,16 June 2017
The Martian," Unexpectedly believable and even touching
","When this movie first came out I was hesitant whether to watch it at all. The premise about a man stranded all alone on Mars for months and coming out of it alive sounded completely ridiculous. If it was a comedy plot then maybe, but for an SF drama, it was too much over the top. Additionally, I'm not a big fan of Matt Damon. But after a few really positive reviews I decided to give it a try. And I was pleasantly surprised. The totally unbelievable premise was turned into an extremely believable movie. I'm not too good at physics, but I suppose the story is full of scientific holes. Still, for a laic, this movie offers quite convincing and touching human drama, supported with awesome visuals, a touch of humor and probably the best Damon's performance so far, shoulder to shoulder with his role in 'Good Will Hunting'. Ridley Scott proved his worth once again.8/10",8,0,0,25 October 2018
Evil Dead II," Skip first one and see this one twice
","When I first saw 'The Evil Dead' (1981) many years ago, I was disappointed. I gave up on franchise and made terrible mistake. 'Evil Dead II' is what its name says but also much more than that. At the beginning movie reboots the story from 'The Evil Dead' and then continues where it left off. Story is painfully stupid and characters make stupidest possible movies in a given situation. But it does not matter at all. There's no introduction or characterization, it's complete madness from the start. The movie is an unstoppable bloody over-the-top action, exaggerated out of all proportion, with a camera that savages all over. Shots that shake and move in all directions, scenes from the first person and a lot of slimy liquids of all colors splashing everywhere. And in the middle of all that Bruce Campbell, whose acting deserves at least nomination for Oscar. The man is damn genius and I can not wait to see him in 'Army of Darkness' and 'Ash vs Evil Dead'. Without delay, tonight. One of those 'it's so bad it's good' flicks that you can rate both zero and ten without the guilty conscience. I rate it8/10",8,6,8,28 February 2018
From Here to Eternity," Army version of the 'Cool Hand Luke'
","This drama by Fred Zinnemann brings us the story about the life of American soldiers in Hawaii just before Pearl Harbor. A realistic portrayal of a soldier's life, with an emphasis on two romantic relationships and a stubborn soldier that is irresistibly reminiscent of the protagonist of the 1967 movie 'Cool Hand Luke'. The film won eight Oscars out of thirteen nominations. The Academy Award for Best Black and White Cinematography seems to me deserved, and even the Oscars for sound and the best supporting role that went into Frank Sinatra's hands, but thirteen nominations is really too much. I wonder what the competition was like if this was the best movie that year. On the other hand, I may not be able to look at it objectively because I have a big problem connecting with characters like these. Similar to Japanese films, where the cultural gap is almost insurmountable to me, the military mentality is so alien to me that their perspective on things, their motivation, and decisions, seems totally illogical and even sick, so I am not able to sympathize with them and for the most of the movie I was thinking - God, what a moron, no normal person would do this. Because of this, the end of the film was not distressing to me but rather irritating and, although I cannot say that I did not like the movie, it did not leave a particularly strong impression, so I give it one extremely subjective seven.7/10",7,0,0,10 April 2020
V for Vendetta," 'People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people.'
","Placed in futuristic Britain, this movie tells a story about dictatorship and the man who became symbol of it's downfall. People from many, not to say majority, countries in today's world can easily identify with the characters. Great adaptation of DC comic and always gladly seen Natalie Portman.8/10",8,41,47,3 March 2018
The Godfather," It is great, but hardly the best
","I finally set out to take three hours to watch 'the best movie ever' and, frankly, I'm not thrilled. Is it good? It's great. But the best... not even close.8/10",8,3,6,17 October 2018
