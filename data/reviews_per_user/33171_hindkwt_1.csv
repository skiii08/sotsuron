The New World," Loved It!
","i was kinda expecting a snooze fest from what i heard on IMDb even thought i was waiting to see it for a while now , I LOVED IT, Terence Mailk did a great Job i think , the cinematography was amazing , Collin was as usual not that good , although he looked great , same can be said for Christian pale only he acted better than Colline still not his best work, the story and the way Terrence shot it you can feel that there is something special and different in the way he works with the camera and uses the music in the amazing scenery shots , amazing , worth watching but not for everybody 'if you like comedies skip this one , this is for true drama lovers , not a lot of dialog though , hard to explain Terrence Malik movies Rating : 8/10",8,0,5,12 February 2007
