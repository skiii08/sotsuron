It," New season of Stranger Things started good
","Well the movie is quite good overall.Great acting , scenes ans music. It's a great remake of the classic. What threw me off was the fact that it looks so much as the series Stranger Things.For some unknown reason directors decided to include way too much ''funny lines'' and jokes to the point yo forget you are watching a horror movie.Nothing like the original IT unsettling atmosphere. This along with how the whole town didn't giving a tiny rats ass about kids being bullied to death literally makes 2 big problems for me. In the theater i swear there were more laughs than scares. Less jokes and less Stranger Things atmosphere would be better for me.",7,3,5,1 October 2017
