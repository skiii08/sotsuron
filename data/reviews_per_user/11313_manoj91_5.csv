The Avengers," Miami.com review quote
","Only Scarlett Johansson (as Black Widow) and Jeremy Renner (as Hawkeye) come off as actors playing dress-up.But despite the assured performances, The Avengers is unconvincing: The illusion doesn't stick. The story ties itself into knots to rationalize why these disparate superheroes would ever band together, under the supervision of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), to thwart the villainous Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Right from the opening scene, a belabored set piece boasting one of the most listless car chases ever filmed, the movie feels off. Everyone talks too much. The pace lumbers. Extraneous characters eat up screen time. You hunker down in your seat and shrug it off, patiently waiting for the film to kick into gear. By the end, you're still waiting.",5,6,20,7 May 2012
Insomnia," Cast aside - what would be left?
","Cast aside.  Just breaking down the film into its plot and direction, there's nothing much about the movie that brings me to feel the tension or feel any compassion for the characters.  Sure the cop had to cover his a**, and robin was just being the regular bad guy we've seen so many times. The main three characters did not even have any chemistry between them, which didn't really make me care what happened to any of them.
This movie is worth watching for movie-goers alike.  Key tip, always keep your expectations low.  Chris could do better, not completely original this time though.",5,0,1,7 September 2002
Avengers: Infinity War," what a boring movie
","Boring movie, few good bits but not coherent and cohesive. needed more dialogue and conversations. Needed to take its time. Too jam packed. I liked thor and hulk in the thor 3 movie. I liked Ant man 1. I liked Iron man 1,2,3. The good part in infinity war - thor was good. thanos was ok. wong was good. dr strange was good. bruce was good.",1,4,11,5 November 2018
A Beautiful Mind," The film was an illusion and a good romantic film
","Ron Howard directs movies which really touches the human spirit.  He has all the themes of hope, courage, and the idea of coming through a struggle. It's a love story and we learn as Hollywood always teaches us that love will get us through all troubles.  When the movie ended, I felt I needed to see more of this John Nash character.  Hey, it's a thoughtful drama.",Null,0,1,3 May 2002
American Gangster," American What? Gangster? Nooo
","Directing is key - Spielberg does it without stars and makes good films. Tony Scott and Zel are a good pair. My favorite was crimson tide - it rules, it rocks. There was no such tension in this movie - prob because it's based on a true story, and jerry goldsmith's orchestral scores were missing. So its about a good cop investigating this business man. Plot's not important. But Zel didn't get a lot of dialog to express his character's character (I know it's redundant).I would've liked to see more of Zel talking and yelling, and getting mad or happy through dialog (not that serious look he has in most of the film) with occasional outbursts of murdering his fellow men. Ha ha. I liked it when he busted a cap.Russell Crowe - holds his own ground - brilliantly - more of a pleasure to watch - how's he gonna do it, how's he gonna get nail that sucker. Well would be cool if Zel knew he would get caught - at least he would keep a low profile - like he said he would or like he made his bro keep a low profile. Damn, his Puerto Rican wife with that loud fur coat and that glamour with photographs, what was Frank Lucas thinking ? Oh right, it's a guess by tony Scott that the coat was what set off a catalyst of events that led to frank's capture. OK, 30 minutes left for frank to snitch on all the dirty cops. Oh, and now he's out of prison in 1991. The end. What??? Come on man, he's back in the dark with the shot of a gun to shine one second of light on the dark background. Part 2 the return of superfly? Wait, that was the temporary name of American gangster. I wonder what happened to his wife and how did he get all that bling bling ??My review of this movie is this: I've seen it twice, still, it runs real well, smooth, cool, entertaining to watch the stars. I don't like this movie cause it could be better, had to have gone in a different direction. More writing, more words. I liked Shawshank - how much were they talking, thought the whole movie right? Damn! Gotta watch it as many times I can, can't say the same about gangster. Russell and Zel were pretty decent in virtuosity, Russell was a funny cyber-man.",4,5,13,3 November 2007
