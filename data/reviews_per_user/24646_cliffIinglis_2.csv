It," BOO?
","'IT'. What can I say? Nothing really. There was,to me, nothing to say anything about. Perhaps I'm getting old and I've had to many jump scares in my time for them to have any effect any more.
 I vaguely recall the TV mini series some years ago with Tim Curry as Pennywise The Clown. His portrayal was far more menacing than Bill Skarsgard's. Next problem for me was the children. There was really no character to them as there was in 'Stand By Me'. Most of the were cliche caricatures like the fat boy etc. It has often been said that Kings novels never transfer to the movies well. I feel this is because his stories play out in the theatre of the mind. This could be put down to the fact that this is how they are created in the mind of King when he writes them and how they are played out when they are read. Your own world is conjured up in your mind and you are disappointed when you see somebody else's interpretation of it. I guess this could apply to any written material transferred to the screen, but more so with King. Even the movie where he has had full control have been a disappointment to most.",Null,0,0,2 January 2018
Dunkirk," Dunkirk. Really?
","Well, I've finally seen 'Dunkirk'. Like most my first impression was one of awe. I was particularly impressed with the dog fight scene.In most movies the planes get a bead on the enemy plane and blast it out of the sky. This showed that it is not that easy. The plane is bobbing around like a cork and you have the enemy plane doing his maneuvers so most times a hit may even be impossible. Then later started to think there was something missing from the movie In my search to find out more about this conflict I came across this documentary, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcX8NvJPOFc. It was while watching this that it came to me what was missing in the movie. It was reality. The opening scenes of the young Brit soldiers walking through the French village stands out. The buildings were pristine, not one brick out of place, no rubble and just flyers floating down. It's a known fact that at this time France was going through hell and a lot of towns and villages were hit. The other thing that I picked up in this doco was the troops on shore were being attacked by waves of 50 to 100 German Stukas. In the movie you only see 2 or 3. The thing Nolan seemed to be proud of was that most of his FX were practical and he did not rely on CGI. While this is indeed an achievement in itself I feel there were parts where CGI wouldn't have gone amiss. It was admitted that they use cardboard cutouts to enhance the number of soldiers waiting on the sure.Photo Shopping was used and massive printers. The easy answer, and cheaper, option would have been to use matts. This is a method whereby images are painted on a glass plate and placed in front of the camera.
As far a performances where concerned I did not see anything that really stood out.",Null,0,0,30 December 2017
