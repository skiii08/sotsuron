Raiders of the Lost Ark," Delivers Everything it Promises
","Looking for a provocative romance or gripping drama? WRONG FILM! This movie is about action, excitement and fun! It set the bar for this genre when it first came out, and still to this day is a benchmark to what other action films are judged. No CGI here - just great sets and innovative stunts. No sex, cussing, or gore either - no time for it. The film is too full of thrilling scenes of adventure, humor, and cliff-hanging danger. Sure its out-done now days by a quarter century of newer technology, but the spirit of the film will live on in anyone who saw it in the theaters, and anyone how rents the DVD and puts themselves back in an early-80's film mode. Yet another great George Lucas/Steven Spielberg movie that parents won't have to feel squeamish about having their kids see due to objectionable content.",10,2,4,23 October 2008
American Beauty," Possibly the most over-rated film in recent history
","His life sucks, family sucks, society sucks. So...lets just write a story affirming it. Gee thanks. Good acting? Abosulutely. (Thus it gets 3 stars from me) But a film ought to have a point beyond spreading depression. What was I suppose to come away from this movie feeling? 'Wow...at least I'm not THAT bad off'? There are plenty of pointless films out there, so no need to bag on this one in particular, but what is pointedly offensive is how 'acclaimed' and 'revered' this movie was by the critics and industry at large. What gives? You throw great actors at something and it just has to be good? Or was their marketing department just working in overdrive?",3,11,23,23 October 2008
The Exorcist," Simply the best horror movie ever
","What makes The Exorcist scarier than all other horror films, is that unlike the rest of the lot, this film takes itself serious. Too many modern cookie cutter horror films have fallen into a predictable recipe of presenting some characters (most viewers start guessing which one's will live and die right from the get go) in really bad situations, apply some psychotic killers or sci-fi monsters, and let the blood fly. The Exorcist is head and shoulders above anything else in the genre, because it is presentation of what would happen if someone were possessed by the devil. Period. And that's scary. There are special effects, sure, but nothing more than needed to depict what would happen during an actual possession. The Rites of Exocism performed are fairly accurate. Compared to modern standards of whiz-bang effects and creative ways to show dismemberment, The Exocist comes off as slow and almost low-key as a film. But, great acting and hauntingly depressing scenes, remind us that nothing is more horrific than common people battling the ultimate evil.",10,0,1,2 January 2007
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Some Movies Change Hollywood Forever
","No one that saw Star Wars when it first came out in the theater will ever forget the opening credits and the low flying Imperial Cruiser that roars over the audiences head at the beginning of a film that would set an unprecedented benchmark for sci-fi. George Lucas took his space/action film to a place above all others at the time, without benefit of CGI technology, overpriced actors, and DVD sales to count on. He did it with the most simple of ideas - good guys defeat bad guys; he did it with humor; he did it with feeling; he did it with excitement and fun. A film with no gore, no sex, no swearing and it made more money than any other film in history at the time. You'd think other film companies would get a clue.",10,0,0,23 October 2008
