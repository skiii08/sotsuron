Captain Phillips," SERIOUSLY, watch it
","I went into this movie with no Expectations at all, i didn't know it was nominated for Oscars and it was a coincidence i Saw it really. but boy how it blew my mind! This movie Will keep you on your toes through it all, without being spooky as horromovies or overly dramatic. Now i read some Of the reviews and it angers me that no one mentions how good muse was, cause his acting, along with Tom hanks Of course, was what really made me love this. I later found out he was nominated for an Oscar and i calmed Down again, aha. But seriously watch this movie, it strangely made me cry, because the idea Of it happening in real life, which it did, really frightens me. I'm not from the United States, I'm from denmark, who were also part owners Of the Alabama maersk ship. But i still Got to proud Of the US's accomplishments, and the lenghts they were Willing to go. Sorry for my english btw",10,3,3,27 October 2019
BlacKkKlansman," Hella dope music
","This film is weird, both funny and tragic. Very good acting and gives you an excellent understanding of the awfulness Of the KKK! But besides all that the Music is popping, like waow.",7,0,4,17 August 2019
Twilight," What's with all these bad reviews
","Yes, i Think We Can all agree that this movie sucks, but that's what makes it so good. Like i mean it when it's the worst movie i've ever watched, but for some reason I can't stop watching it. I love the cullens family and when you watch all the movies it all just makes sense. I love these movies just as much as I hate them, and I know you do too. That's why I give it 10 stars.",10,1,5,20 October 2019
