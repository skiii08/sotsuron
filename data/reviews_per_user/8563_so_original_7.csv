Scarface," Yes, it is worth the hype.
","A definitive classic, 'Scarface' has remained relevant and entertaining to fans, 25 years after its release. It tells the story of Cuban immigrant Tony Montana, played amazingly by Al Pacino. Tony is reckless, defiant, charismatic, and hungry for success in America. He and his friend Manolo come to America, and become involved in the drug dealing business. After a couple of lucrative deals, and dethroning a drug kingpin who backstabbed him, Tony climbs to the top of his empire. He has the money, he has the power. But soon, his decisions affect everything and everyone around him, endangering him of losing it all.Those who say that this film is not 'worth the hype' are wrong. It is a very lengthy film, clocking in at a little over 2 1/2 hours. But it is worth it. It takes time to allow this story to unfold. One can't go from ex-convict refugee to wealthy drug lord completely overnight. It is a wonderfully written story. From the beginning, you can see the lengths Tony is willing to go to get what he wants. He doesn't feel guilt over killing a Communist to obtain a green card, or doesn't slow down when his friend is murdered in a drug trade gone bad. He just keeps going. Coming from humble backgrounds, Tony has outrageous goals he wants to achieve, such as owning a tiger and stealing his boss's girlfriend Elvira, and building a family with her. However, he proceeds to get these things, because of his bold and driven attitude. But, the film is also a morality tale. The ways in which Tony lives and gets what he wants are illegal, immoral, and unhealthy. The attitude Tony displays often gets him into trouble. This is what ultimately leads to his downfall.The cast of characters are played by talented actors. In the lead role, Al Pacino shines as Tony Montana. He is all at once funny, charming, violent, and brash. He could be considered the bad guy, but he has a way of making you like him. However, you know eventually he will meet his downfall, which he does. Michelle Pfeiffer also stands out in her debut role as Elvira, the bored drug-addicted housewife. On the surface, Elvira seems cold and distant to those around her. But, as the film goes on, you can tell she is a good person who is just caught up in the storm going on around her. Steven Bauer,who plays Manolo, is a great, more light hearted counterpart to Montana and Mary Elizabeth Monstrantonio also does well as Tony's spunky and sweet natured young sister Gina, who eventually gets corrupted by his world, despite his efforts for her not to be.This film has found great popularity among the youth of today, especially those in the hip-hop community. I think its because it speaks to the ambitious dreams of those who come from humble beginnings. Some people want it all, the so-called American Dream, and will do whatever they can do obtain it, such as Tony did. But the question this film poses is : When you get it, are you actually happy? Was it all worth it? 'Scarface' speaks to the morals in all of us, and is a more complex movie than some give it credit for.And it is definitely in my top 5 movies of all time, by the way. Bias or not, I recommend this to almost anyone, because it speaks to a lot of people. Just as long as you don't mind a lot of profanity or violence, or go into it with great expectations, you should be pleased.",9,0,1,2 March 2008
Erin Brockovich," Entertaining Vehicle for Julia Roberts.
","Julia Roberts is the star in this based-on-a-true story film, 'Erin Brockovich'. It's a classic 'David and Goliath' tale, that pits one woman against a huge corporation. Erin Brockovich (Roberts) is a single mother of three, with little money and plenty of attitude. As she takes a job as a secretary in a law firm, headed by former lawyer Ed Masry (Albert Finney), she discovers the horrors taking place in the small town of Hinkley. The water has been contaminated, and has altered the lives of these working class people. Brockovich makes it her mission to take down PG&E (the corporation responsible for the contamination) and she and Masry, with the 637 Hinkley residents, go toe to toe with the corporate giant in court.Clearly, this is a vehicle for Julia Roberts, first and foremost. The character of Brockovich, the journey she goes on and the growth she experiences from helping people and making a difference is the main focus of the film. However, Roberts truly proves her acting skills and that she's more than a box office draw and a megawatt smile. Julia is known for taking on the 'girl next door'-esquire roles. Even her breakthrough role as a prostitute in 'Pretty Woman' was written as the nicest prostitute you'll ever meet. But, Erin Brockovich is a grittier character. She swears and struts her way through the scenery, chewing out those who challenge her and shocking more conservative types with her revealing wardrobe. Although she often comes off tough and provocative, it is also made clear that Erin has a warm heart. Her determination and defiance comes from an honest desire to help make her life and her kids' lives better. She also makes an emotional connection with the plaintiffs, seeing them less as clients and more as an extended family. The way Julia creates a nice balance between Erin's strong and soft side and makes her a complex character truly proves her talent. Her Best Actress Oscar was well deserved, in my opinion.Of course, there are other well played characters in this film as well. Albert Finney makes the contrast between his Ed Masry character and Erin Brockovich clear. He's conservative, she's over the top. He plays it safe, she makes her own rules. He thinks in a more business-like lawyer fashion, while she distrusts lawyers and tends to think with her heart (which helps her relate to the plaintiffs). As Erin's foil, it is clear that these two can learn from each other and as the film progresses they do. Aaron Eckhart is Erin's boyfriend George, who begins to feel inadequate when constantly playing Mr. Mom to Erin's kids, and Marg Helgenberger as one of the standout Hinkley plaintiffs. It is Erin's show, but the supporting characters help her to figure out more about herself and the world around her.All in all, the film is a pretty standard genre. Even the director, Steven Soderbergh, shoots in a straightforward (but visually rich) fashion. Nothing too suspenseful, as we all know what's going to happen in the end (or else the movie wouldn't be made). But, the story is entertaining and the acting is excellent. And when you get down to it, that's all most movies need.",8,0,1,19 May 2008
The Devil Wears Prada," Follow Your Dreams, But Don't Sell Your Soul
","That is the basic morality message of the film, 'The Devil Wears Prada'. The plot revolves around aspiring journalist Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) who takes a job as second assistant to the icy tyrant Miranda Priestley (Meryl Streep), who is editor in chief of 'Runway' magazine. The job is both demeaning and demanding, but Andy takes it to ensure her future success as a journalist. But, Andy soon learns that she is sacrificing the relationships around her (particularly with her close friends and boyfriend) and her own values to further her career.The film's perspective on the fashion world is both negative and positive. On one hand, it seems to say that the fashion business is a shallow and cutthroat industry. Women who wear a size 6 are considered fat, those who wear anything but couture are laughed at, you never question the boss, and be willing to sacrifice your interpersonal relationships to get ahead. That seems to be the opinion of those on the outside looking in. Those that work in the fashion industry see their job as important, fulfilling, and meaningful and are willing to climb the ladder of success (or stay at the top) in any way possible. Even if it means being a mindless slave or stabbing someone in the back. Where the line is drawn and what is the 'true' perspective is never seems to be concrete, and it is up to the audience, like our heroine Andy, to decide what's wrong and what's right.As for the performances, Meryl Streep is fantastic as Miranda Priestley. She's not necessarily the lead, but she is the most memorable character. Miranda is demanding and ruthless, impatient and imposing. She never raises her voice, yet everyone is scared of her. Streep is purposely and perfectly understated; both outrageously cold and subtly funny. As a viewer, you loathe and love her all at once. Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci are both humorous and believable as Emily and Nigel ; the former Miranda's neurotic, snot-nosed first assistant and the latter the wise and lovable fashion editor of 'Runway'. Andy seems to pale in comparison to these colorful characters, but Anne Hathway does her best to make her work. She's likable, but a little too naive and pushed around by others (although thats probably the point). But her character did go through the most development, and you see Andy finally gaining strength near the end and the ability to make her own decisions.In conclusion, the most compelling thing about 'The Devil Wears Prada' is Meryl Streep. Her character proves to be the most entertaining, with Blunt and Tucci tying for second place. However, it is a solid, yet predictable, plot with some funny dialogue. So it's worth a watch.",7,0,0,1 June 2008
The Shining," Chilling and Memorable
","'The Shining' is often named as one of the greatest horror films ever made. And while I do agree that it is in the top five in the horror genre, its not exactly a perfect film. It has its superb moments and its lackluster moments, in my opinion.As far as the good points go, Jack Nicholson is one of the obvious ones. Nicholson is a very talented actor and his role in this film is a display of his brilliance. He has the ability to turn almost every role he plays into a one-man show (for example, his iconic role as The Joker in 1989's Batman). He makes his character, also ironically named Jack, dimensional. He's menacing, conflicted, witty, and eventually psychotic. Danny Lloyd, also playing a character of the same name, also does a great job with his role as the little boy who 'sees all'. The film in itself, based on the infamous Stephen King's novel, has a disturbing atmosphere to it. A few of the famous scenes ('Redrum', the twins in the hallway, 'Here's Johnny!') definitely leave an impression on the viewer.As far as the negative goes, one big problem I had with the film was the casting of Shelley Duvall. She is, at least in my opinion, a horrible actress. Or shall I say over-actress. But, to her credit, I'm not sure if it was her acting or if her character was actually written to be shrill and stupid. Either way, she was distractingly bad and unintentionally funny in most of her scenes. Also, the running length does go a little long. It clocks in it at over 2 1/2 hours. I can watch a film that long if the story keeps moving and developing. There are a handful of certain scenes that feel too drawn out and prolonged, dragging the pace of the film unnecessarily. I understand King's novel was very lengthy, but the film could've been just as effective if cut down about 30 or 40 minutes.That being said, this film is still breath-taking and much better than some of these 'slasher' flicks that have come out in the last decade or so. But, it does have its flaws at the same time.",7,2,3,16 July 2008
"Girl, Interrupted"," Free Your Mind
","'Girl Interrupted' is set in a women's mental institution in the late 1960's and based on the autobiography by writer Susanna Kaysen. Winona Ryder plays the lead role as Susanna, who's not so much 'crazy' as she is a very conflicted and lost young woman. Ryder plays the role convincingly, with a dose of vulnerability, as we watch her character go through her own personal growth and awakening. Ryder has always been a great actress, but Angelina Jolie manages to steal the show as Lisa, the role that brought her mainstream fame and the Best Supporting Actress Oscar in 2000. Jolie nails the role as the sociopath: she's charming and alluring on the surface, yet also dangerously ruthless and insensitive. She's very compelling as an actress, and this film shows she's more than just a sex symbol. Other supporting actresses include Whoopi Goldberg as the tough yet down-to-earth nurse and Clea Duvall as the pathological liar Georgina, who are also great. 'Girl Interrupted' is a solid film, with interesting subject matter, and is worth the watch.",8,2,2,19 July 2008
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," The Chemistry Carries the Movie.
","Before it was even released, 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' received endless publicity. Not particularly because of the film itself. But because of the drama behind the scenes. You know the story : super-sexy Brad Pitt is married to Jennifer Aniston, goes on the set of this film with super-sexy Angelina Jolie, something may or may not have happened between them, Pitt and Aniston get divorced after the film wraps, and suddenly Pitt and Jolie are a couple! Did Brad and Angelina have a steamy affair on-set that caused the eventual divorce of Brad and Jennifer? During those months of press, this question was continually denied. But, what we can tell is there is plenty of chemistry between the two leads, which makes this movie sizzle.The plot of 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' revolves around John(Brad Pitt) and Jane(Angelina Jolie) Smith, a couple that has been unhappily married for 5 (or 6) years. They can't seem to relate to each other like they did before they were married. But little does the other spouse know that both John and Jane are secret assassins, that are working for rival organizations. And when the truth comes out, it has hilarious, action-packed and unexpected effects.The story is pretty creative, yes. It puts a new twist on the standard 'marriage issues' plot. However, halfway through the movie it wears thin and the 'make a joke in an action situation' punchlines sometimes get old. But, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie milk the script for all its worth. Both of them are somewhat underrated when it comes to their acting, and more known for their sex appeal than their actual talent. They both have a great sense of the tongue-in-cheek aspect of the film (that blends action, comedy, and romance) and have a great comic rapport with each other. Their chemistry together is all at once passionate, funny, and believable. You actually can picture them as a couple. Nicole Kidman was rumored to have been considered for Jolie's role, but I honestly couldn't imagine two better actors as the leads. It wouldn't have worked as well, and the story would have dragged instead of entertained.In retrospect, its no surprise that Pitt and Jolie became a couple after this film. The fireworks between them is the reason that this movie delivers.",7,1,3,18 May 2008
Scream," 'What's Your Favorite Scary Movie?' Scream.
","'Scream' remains one of the smartest and most entertaining teen slasher films ever. Why? Well, of course there's the actors. Neve Campbell definitely gives Jamie Lee Curtis a run for her money as the Reigning Teem Scream Queen. She makes the lead character, Sidney Prescott, all at once strong, smart, and vulnerable. Besides Sidney, there's ruthless and ambitious reporter Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox); dopey but lovable cop Dewey (David Arquette); Sidney's feisty and funny best friend Tatum (Rose McGowan); Sidney's brooding boyfriend Billy and his wisecracking friend Stu (Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard); and movie-obsessed geek Randy (Jamie Kennedy). All the characters are distinctive and well-acted, and it really is an ensemble film.However, it is the writing by Kevin Williamson that makes 'Scream' truly special. As Billy states to Sidney at one point, 'It's all one big movie. You just can't pick your genre'. The film stays true to this quote. Unlike other slasher films full of clueless teens, the characters in 'Scream' know they're in a movie. And if they don't, they sure do know a lot about them. The script contains several humorous, pop culture references to movies (many of them being horror films). The film takes pleasure in poking fun and deconstructing many horror movie standards and clichés. 'Scream' is still a horror movie itself and often implies a few of these so-called rules. But they are often done in an ironic and inventive way. The death scenes are creative, the characters are actually smart and know how to fight back, and the plot twists are effectively surprising. Actually, it would be safe to say that 'Scream' is not so much of a horror movie, but a mystery movie with blood and violence. Unlike Freddy, Michael, and Jason, the killer is never given an identity until the climax of the film. 'Everyone is a suspect!' Randy proclaims. At different points in the movie, every character does come under questioning. Is it Billy, Sid's dark and angst-ridden boyfriend? Did Randy see one too many movies and snap? Or is Gale doing all of this to get another story? Anything can happen, and the final reveal is very unexpected.'Scream' is amazingly entertaining and suspenseful on the first viewing. And the great thing is it remains fresh and continues to keep you on your seat every time you watch it. Afterwards, many teen slasher copycats like 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' and 'Urban Legends' were made, and two more films in the 'Scream' series, but none of them are like the original 'Scream'.",8,0,0,21 May 2008
