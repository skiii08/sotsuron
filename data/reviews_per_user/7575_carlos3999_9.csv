Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It Works as a Kids Movie...And it's a fun one.
","Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace is not a bad movie at all. It's not a great movie, and is certainly inferior to the original Star Wars trilogy, but it's far better than it's sequel, Attack of the Clones. The Phantom Menace is a fun and cheerful family movie. It doesn't have the memorable mythology of the original trilogy. It lacks character development, yes, and these new characters lack the likability of the original characters. That said, The Phantom Menace didn't bored me, and I enjoyed it because it delivered what it promised to deliver. It has solid performances, flat but sometimes funny dialogue (hey, it's only a kids movie), wonderful special effects and action sequences that are a lot of fun. And that was enough for me, as this is only the first chapter in the Star Wars saga and it plays better as an introduction than a real important passage of the story. We get to see new planets, places we didn't see in the original trilogy, and the story is nicely developed in a way that we meet young Anakin Skywalker and we are aware that he is just a kid, but with a special gift. Liam Neesom also manages to make his character more interesting. He is the wise jedi who encounters Anakin and becomes aware that he is not an ordinary boy. Yes, the acting could be a bit better, but it's fine enough. Another thing I want to mention is that some people believe this is inferior to Attack of the Clones, the next chapter. I strongly disagree. The direction, writing, pacing and acting in this movie are far better than in its sequel. The reason why this film works is that it only wants to be a fun kids film, and on that level it succeeds very well. Not many family movies are good, and this one is. *** out of ****",Null,1,2,26 October 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Splendid Visuals and Entertaining Action Sequences Make This Movie Enjoyable
","STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES is a decent movie. I have a great admiration for the original STAR WARS trilogy, so obviously I went to see this new installment.  I left the theater happy, but a bit disappointed. Let me divide what I liked and what I disliked about the film:1.- The Good Stuff: a) Decent Story. SPOILERS................... I liked the story. It's not bad at all, although it's not great. Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his padawan learner Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) are given a mission to protect the senator of the planet Naboo, Amidala (Natalie Portman). There is an attempt on her life and now Ob Wan is sent to investigate the mistery of who is trying to kill her, which leads him to a discovery that someone is secretly creating an army of the republic, formed by...you guessed it, clones. Meanwhile, Anakin is sent to protect senator Amidala on her home planet of Naboo, where they both fall in love. Let me tell you...for a sci-fi movie, this plot is OK. But it's basically just a transition between Episode I and Episode III. It's a bit overlong at a certain point. However, the plot is not important in this film. It is just a setup for well-made action sequences and to show impressive visual effects.b) SOME of the acting: Ewan McGregor is quite good as the Jedi-knight Obi Wan Kenobi. He knows what he's doing and has some fun with his character (if somewhat underdeveloped character). He is witty, funny and has fun on the screen. Christopher Lee is also good as the evil Count Dooku. Hayden Christensen, has a few good scenes in which he gives a good performance, but I will get to that later. Oh, and Natalie Portman looks just terrific, wearing different costumes in every single scene.c) Great Visuals. The movie deserves an Academy Award for it's amazing visual effects. The movie looks gorgeous. This is the best-looking film of all of the STAR WARS films. My eyes were couldn't believe what they were seeing. It is just a great film to look at.d) Great Action Sequences. Yes, there are many and entertaining action sequences. One involves a chase sequence through the streets of Coruscant. Another involves a massive fight at a Coliseum, that is just impressive to look at, and it is filled with excitment. There are more effective action sequences. And a final lightsaber duel between Yoda and Count Dooku that it's just great fun.The Bad Stuff: a) The Dialogue. The first hour of the film consists of too much dialogue in my opinion, which is very flat and laughably bad in some scenes, especially in the scenes between Anakin and Amidala. George Lucas should get someone else to write the dialogue in Episode III.b) SOME Wooden Acting. Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman are sometimes flat in the film. Their words feel like they are not having fun in the film. They look bored, and unhappy. Probably because it is difficult to act in a film with blue screens around you, trying to act as if you were in a real place. They're not terrible, they're pretty good in some scenes, but in others they look somewhat flat.And that's about it. Yes, Episode II does have some bad things: dialogue and wooden acting. But the excellent visuals and the terrific action sequences make it enjoyable, and that's all what I wanted. To enjoy the film. And I did.* * * out of * * * *",5,0,0,2 September 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Splendid Visuals and Entertaining Action Sequences. Nothing More.
","I love the original Star Wars Trilogy. Obviously, I had to see this new installment. I was hoping to see Anakin taking his first steps into the dark side. I was hoping to see a decent love story between Anakin and the beautiful Amidala. I was hoping to see great visual effects. I was hoping to see great action sequences. And I was hoping to have a lot of fun. I did, although not as much as I would hope for.
STAR WARS: EPISODE II - ATTACK OF THE CLONES is a decent picture. It's not a great movie, but it has some good stuff in it. It's not quite up there with the original three installments. But, yes, it is better than THE PHANTOM MENACE (A movie I found entertaining, if a bit childish). The plot is.....well...a bit complex if you're not a SW fan: there's a LOT of trouble in the galaxy, and there is an attempt at senator Amidala (Natalie Portman). The Jedi Council orders great Jedi-knight Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his padawan learner (Hayden Christensen) to protect senator Amidala. But meanwhile, there is another attempt to kill Amidala, in which Obi Wan ends up trying to investigate the bounty hunter, which leads him to a planet where they are building an army of the republic, which is formed of...you guessed it, clones. Meanwhile, Anakin and Amidala travel the planet Naboo, where they both fall in love.
All of that, is the plot. But this is not a movie to discuss the endless plot. This is a movie in which one has to seat back, and enjoy the visuals on the screen. There's nothing better than that in the film. If you want to go to the movie, and be interested by a story, and find intriguing characters, and find a great love story, and be moved, or be challenged, then prepare to be dissappointed. The movie has banal dialogue, a love story in which the very little chemistry that exists is because of how cute the two lead actors look together (Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman).Do not confuse dialogue and story. The film has a decent story (if a bit overlong), but it has bad dialogue. The story is just fine.The acting is so-so. Hayden Christensen is sometimes good, and sometimes flat. Natalie Portman looks just terrific, wearing different costumes in every scene, and she has a kind of warm smile that gives her character a bit juice. Ewan McGregor is the best actor in the film. He is very witty and good, and he is much better here than in THE PHANTOM MENACE. Christopher Lee is also good as the Count Dooku, a new evil jedi knight who is helping Darth Sidious with his evil plan to rule over the galaxy.The directing could be better. George Lucas is too busy with his visuals that he should put a little more strength in his characters.However, the action sequences are great. Just great. They make the movie worthy. And the visuals, deserve an Academy Award.OVERALL: Despite it's flat and banal dialogue, sometimes wooden acting by Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman, the film has a decent sci-fi story. It has great visual effects and it has TERRIFIC action sequences.*** out of ****",5,0,0,1 September 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," This is NOT a good movie
","Attack of the Clones is an inferior film to The Phantom Menace, and certainly a VERY inferior film to the original Star Wars trilogy. Why? Because it simply doesn't have what a good movie needs: a good script. It appears that the director George Lucas, made his new film from the technology he has. This is a film that doesn't care about it's characters, and it's apparently not interested neither in delivering things the original trilogy delivered: witty, smart and colorful dialogue. This is a movie that only cares to make things look great, to deliver some very fun action sequences, but apart from that, it fails as a good Star Wars movie. And surprisingly, the film it's not as much fun as you'd think. The first 90 minutes of the film are very boring, filled with cheesy lines in a love story that just doesn't work. Even if there is chemistry between the two actors Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman, their characters are so thin, so lifeless, so boring, that I didn't cared for them or for their love story. Is there something good in the movie? Yes, there are some good things. The visual effects are truly impressive. This is definetly the best-looking Star Wars film. It is filled with beautiful places. The art direction, and the costume design are also good.Another thing that entertained me are the action scenes. There is one early chase scene set in Coruscant (a futuristic city)that is very exciting. And those last 30 minutes are a lot of fun, set in a Coliseum. But the sad part is....most of the film is not like this.Attack of the Clones is, in a few words, a weak film. Yes, it is a very beautiful film to look at, enjoyable at times, but as a whole the movie feels very weak and lame, because of it's banal script, bad dialogue, boring first 90 minutes, and....weak acting.",5,0,1,21 October 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A Disappointing Episode
","I was quite disappointed by this last entry in the Star Wars franchise.I admired and enjoyed a lot the original STAR WARS trilogy, and I actually liked the much-hated Episode I. That was a juvenile film, yes, with flat dialogue (not banal), but at least it was entertaining, the story was decent and it was overall fun. But I cannot say the same thing about Attack of the Clones. I clearly see it is a great-looking movie. It is a wonderful film to look at. Just wonderful. All of the visual effects, all of the amazing places, new places, amazing monsters, the art direction, was all very neat. It is pure eye-candy. The action sequences are fun too. During the first half hour there's an exciting chase sequence through the streets of Coruscant, and almost at the end, there's a very impressive sequence set in a vast Coliseum (sort of a 'Gladiator' style scene), where huge and scary monsters attack the heroes: Anakin Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi, and Padme Amidala. The sequence is done well, and from that point, Episode II becomes somewhat good.But sadly, most of the film, is not like this. Most of the time the film is boring. The mistake of the film is that it just doesn't have a good script. It is one of the most banal scripts ever conceived into a film. It begins with a lot of characters talking about the problems in the Republic, all of the political crisis, and about the Empire, and bla bla bla. I was amazed that those scenes were incredibly unconvincing, even sometimes laughably bad. There's also a love story, involving Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman). But the love story is so artificial, filled with tired cliches, bad and corny dialogue, the sort of things characters use to say in lame soap operas. And the acting is just well...flat. The actors look like they're not having fun with their roles. They look tired, and sometimes I felt like I was watching a junior high school play, set in space. Even gifted actors like Ewan McGregor and Samuel L. Jackson, look muted in the film. And the story itself, it's just basically an ending to Episode I and an introduction to Episode III, but it's not really a story in it's own way.Because of the excellent visual effects, the entertaining action sequences, and because it is a great-looking film, it is not THAT bad. It's a mediocre film, but not a very bad one. It's the bad script that makes it mediocre. Some people may think I'm being too critical. I know people who say they liked the film, people who say they thought it was 'cool' or entertaining. It is entertaining at times, but not most of the time. I can almost recommend the movie because the visuals are about to win me over, but no. I cannot recommend a film where the dialogue is flat, the story is boring and the acting is mediocre. Oh, and I almost forgot to say that many people seem to think that this is a better film than THE PHANTOM MENACE. It is not. I actually think that THE PHANTOM MENACE is a good movie, certainly better than this.** out of ****",5,0,1,25 September 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Best Film Ever
","I did not read the books. I did not even know a lot about the movie before I went to see it. I had seen the trailers and it looked like a visually stunning film. The Fellowship of the Ring is a great film. It has all the elements one could love in a movie: fantasy, action, drama, suspense, romance (only a bit of romance). It is done to perfection. Peter Jackson has created a masterpiece that will be remembered for generations. It is a huge success on every department: acting, screenplay, visual effects, art direction, music, action, pacing, direction, and everything else. It really could be considered the best film ever made.",10,2,3,24 September 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," One of the Best Films Ever Made
","THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is a true masterpiece. No, it's not because of the hype. No, it's not because of the popularity. No, it's not because it was a huge box-office success. No, it's not because it earned 13 Academy Award nominations. It's because it is a truly amazing achievement in the history of cinema. Films like this are usually never made. Only every once in a while we get a truly great classic. Luckily last year director Peter Jackson and his team delivered a truly great motion picture.Let me say first that, I am not a fan of the LOTR books. I have never read the books. In fact, I went into the movie without knowing what to expect. I had only seen the trailer and it looked like it was going to be a good-looking movie, so I went to see it. When it was over, I could not believe what I had just witnessed. It surpassed my expectations and the hype that it had created. I was mesmerized. I was blown-away. I kept thinking: 'I have never seen anything like this before'. I was captivated by the powerful look of the film, the powerful and epic story, the characters, the excitment, the cinematography, the score, the visual effects, the action, the drama, and everything. I guess I can call this film, in so many different ways as 'the perfect film'. Because it is a film that puts together all of the pieces that one can love in a film.Everything, absolutely everything about the film is great: the direction, the acting, the story...etc. It doesn't have flaws in my opinion, and although some people complained about the length (3 hrs) of the film, I wasn't bothered by it. In fact, it didn't feel like three hours for me. When it was over, I wanted more.For anyone who hasn't seen this film (who hasn't?), I truly recommend it. It is a triumph. It is a masterful movie that will be remembered for generations. For a movie that's 3 hrs long, and leaves me wanting more, hey, not so many long movies can do that. And I am hugely anticipating the next two sequels.* * * * out of * * * *",10,1,1,3 September 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Probably the most impressive and spectacular epic ever made.
","There are not enough words to describe how wonderful, imaginative, powerful, impressive, spectacular and great this film is. And believe me, this are the words from someone who has a very open mind about films. Very few films have managed to come across with such power on the screen. The first film was a great achievement, and by the time I saw it I just could not believe how it could be surpassed. But it did, it really did. Maybe not on an emotional level, because by necessity, this film can't stand alone. It's only the middle chapter, it doesn't have a real beggining or a real ending. But surprisingly, it does enough with it's characters to care about the story.I will not get into describing the story, because you all know what it is about. What I do want to describe it's how well it's the story told and how well the film is done. This film is certainly much darker than it's predecessor, and more violent, too. And there is also an interesting thing about it: it doesn't exactly feels like a fantasy film, precisely because it looks so real, and partly because most of the story centers in the country of Rohan, the world of men. There are not a lot of 'fantastic' places here. But that does not harm the film, because in a way, it makes the film feel more like one of those great epics such as Braveheart.The visual effects are the most impressive ones I have ever seen. At least for the last hour of the film (which centers on the now famous Helm's Deep battle scene), there are some images that I never even imagined in my dreams. There are, some really wonderful and AWE-inspiring shots that look....amazing. And...of course, there's Gollum, the most believable CGI creature I have ever seen (and a compelling character, too).What I loved about 'The Two Towers', is that it's the kind of film you don't see very often. It's one of those very very few films that leave you thinking about it for a LONG time. It's great on every aspect. It's the kind of film where you'd have to write a big review for how well the story is told, how amazing the direction is, how good the acting is, how impressive the visual effects are, how dark, dramatic, violent, heroic and inspiring it is, and...how lovable it is.10 / 10.",10,0,0,5 March 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Much Better Than The First Film. It's A Very Enjoyable Movie.
","I liked the original 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'. It was a fun movie, full of special effects, some good action scenes (if only a few), good performances and a imaginative story. I liked it, yes, but I didn't loved it.This sequel, 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' is considerably a much better film in my opinion. It is a visually gorgeous film to look at. The art direction, combined with the neat special effects, and good costume design, makes the movie great-looking. Second, it has a more interesting story that starts right from the very beggining and it doesn't have a BIG introduction, like the first movie. We already know the characters, but we get to know more of them this time. There IS character development, helped by very good acting by all of the cast, including the three kids, who deliver their lines with style and personality. These kids look like they're having fun with their roles. The story surprisingly kept me interested, and the dialogue was just so full of wit. The movie is also darker and scarier than the first film. It has two quite scary action sequences involving spiders and a pretty ugly monster at the end of the film (a final action sequence that looked and felt as a scary horror film).This is the kind of film kids will LOVE, and adults can enjoy without being bored. It is an improvement over the first film. And I have a suspicion that the next film will be even darker and better.***1/2 out of ****",Null,0,0,23 November 2002
