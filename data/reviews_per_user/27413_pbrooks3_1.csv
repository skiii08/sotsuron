Requiem for a Dream," blow my mind!
","I just arrived home from seeing this film. My head is still spinning and I have a feeling that I've been beaten up, but in an oddly good way. This film crosses some serious boundaries in all ways. Aronofsky is a genuis who knows how to freak us out and make us cry with seamless effort. I was so disturbed and yet so empathetic for the characters. Ellen Burstyn should be nominated, but may not be because of the nature of the film. That would be a real shame. She took the biggest risk of her career in playing this character. What an amazing ride. Popcorn with this film would be an insult and would probably make you sick. My mouth hung open though most of it.I would have no energy to chew it.
