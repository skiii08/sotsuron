The Blair Witch Project," Re-evaluation from a one-time harsh critic...
","I originally slammed this film when I first saw it. Having had a chance to see it again in a more proper setting, I find myself changing my opinion on this film.You see, the first time I saw it was on the big screen. A matinÃ©e showing, at that. How scary can anything be in a crowded building in the middle of the afternoon? The next time I saw it was at home, at night, after having watched the 'Curse of the Blair Witch' back story mockumentary. It also helped that I live near the woods. This time, I saw how truly scary this film can be. Without the sound distortion of the theater's Surroundsound system, many of the scary sounds came through much more clearly. And seeing the back story helps you to see some of the supernatural aspects (that house at the end isn't even supposed to be there!).Seen the right way (at night, as close to alone as possible, near or in the woods if you can manage it), this is a horror masterpiece.",8,0,2,3 March 2006
Gettysburg," Magnificent Civil War epic
","Based on Michael Shaara's great novel 'The Killer Angels', this is one of the most impressive movies about the American Civil War that I've ever seen. It is a shame that the theaters are unable to screen a movie of this length, otherwise this would have been up for numerous Oscars.
In one memorable scene after another, we are told the tale of the pivotal battle of the Civil War, where the Confederacy made huge tactical mistakes that turned the tide of the war against them. Particularly memorable is the scene where Colonel Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels) addresses a group of deserters, and through the conviction and passion of his argument, convinces them to re-enlist for the coming battle. Martin Sheen gives the performance of his career (so far) as General Robert E. Lee, portraying him as a gentleman, a warrior, and a patriot to his cause.The reason this film is so powerful is that it doesn't take sides, as some Civil War movies tend to do. The Rebels aren't shown as a bunch of uneducated, slave-driving rednecks, but as people fighting for their personal liberty. That they kept slaves but fought for liberty is an irony not lost on the Rebels; one Confederate officer comments 'We should have freed the slaves first, then fired on Fort Sumter.' The Confederates weren't fighting for the right to keep slaves, they were fighting to remain free from a federal government that they felt was growing too powerful, and that message is made clear in this film.Highly recommended; I give it 9/10.",10,2,3,20 June 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Ignore the critics; this movie is a blast!
","I'm not sure what the critics expect to see when they go to a Star Wars film, but it's clear they are missing something. Maybe they can't bring themselves to have fun at a movie. Maybe they think every last film has to have some grim, depressing, meaningful socio-political message to it. Too bad for them. If they can't enjoy a film like this, that's their loss.What does 'Attack of the Clones' offer? Exciting chase scenes, huge battles, political intrigue, the battle of good against evil, broad humor, and the required lightsaber duel. Just like all the other Star Wars films. So why do critics praise the original trilogy and pan Episodes I & II?The critics complained that 'The Phantom Menace' was too lighthearted. Do they praise 'Clones' for being more serious in tone, for showing that the good guys don't always win? Of course not.True fans of Star Wars will be blown away by this movie. Anakin's descent towards the Dark Side starts, the Clone War is begun (do those Clone Troopers look familiar?), and Yoda shows that he is more than a foot-tall Zen Philosopher, he is a Jedi Master, the most powerful Jedi on the Council.One complaint; the dialogue between Anakin and Amidala as they profess their feelings for each other is so cliched, the audience at the screening I attended couldn't contain their snickering. But this, too, is part of Star Wars tradition, when you think about it; the love scenes between Han and Leia were no better.One warning; there is a scene that might disturb younger viewers, when Anakin goes to the encampment of the Tusken Raiders. I won't give any details, as I don't do spoilers, but this scene is largely where Anakin's slide towards the Dark Side really begins, and the Dark Side is not pleasant.I give this film 8/10. It's a blast. Go see it if you like having fun at the movies.",8,0,0,16 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Epic fantasy literature becomes epic fantasy cinema
","I have never, in my whole life, been so impressed with a motion picture as I was with this masterful adaption of Tolkien's classic epic. The acting and direction are flawless, and the visualization of Middle-Earth is breathtaking. Every detail, from casting to scoring, was handled as if Tolkien himself was watching over the production.As far as I can tell, the movie's main critics are a) uptight Tolkien purists, and b) people who didn't like or haven't read Tolkien's work. The uptight critics say that Jackson left too much out, but the truth is that much of Tolkien's narrative is just too slow to be filmed well. I, for one, was glad to see the story tightened up a bit; I got a bit tired of those happy little Hobbits singing silly songs and falling ass-backwards into extraneous troubles every few pages. Also, Tolkien never actually described Lord Sauron in the novels; he left it to the reader's imagination what the Dark Lord looked like. That worked perfectly in print, but the cinema is a different medium altogether. The scene where Sauron the Great takes the battlefield is one of the most heart-stopping in the whole movie.
If your idea of a good fantasy film is wall-to-wall swordplay with lots of scantily clad chicks in chainmail, this isn't the movie for you. If you think the genre of epic fantasy deserves better than Xena and D&D, if you like movies with an intelligent plot and story, if you think dialogue is more important to a fantasy film than the sound of swords clashing endlessly, then Peter Jackson's vision of the greatest heroic fantasy is for you. I give it 10/10.",10,1,1,22 June 2002
Van Helsing," A treat for fans of the classic monsters...
","As a fan of the classic monsters from the old Universal Studios films, I was probably bound to enjoy this film no matter how bad it turned out. If you're a fan of the old films...Lugosi's 'Dracula', Karloff's 'Frankenstein', and Chaney Jr.'s 'The Wolf Man', and all the myriad sequels...you're apt to like this film, and see its flaws as forgivable. After all, the old films, particularly the ones from the 1940's, were far from perfect.And there are flaws. The plot is overwrought, the acting by many of the supporting roles is at times wooden, the Wolf Man (I refer to Velkan; there's more than one werewolf in this film) doesn't have enough screen time, and some of the fight scenes (especially near the end) go on way too long. And the second scene of the film (with Van Helsing fighting Mr. Hyde) is completely unnecessary.However, when this film is on, it's on in style. The opening scene is hard to top; the creation of the Monster, Dracula trying to take control of the Monster, an angry mob chasing the Monster to an old windmill, and the pathos of the Monster as the windmill burns, all in black and white as a beautiful tribute to the classic films. The portrayals of Dracula and the Frankenstein Monster would have made Lugosi and Karloff happy; their signature characters are handled as though they were directing Roxburgh and Hensley themselves.If you aren't a fan of the old classic monster movies, you probably won't be too impressed with 'Van Helsing'. However, as long as you go understanding that this is a popcorn film, a movie to enjoy with your higher brain taking a snooze, you'll like it. It's just as much fun as Sommers' Mummy films.
And if you are a fan of Lugosi, Karloff, and Chaney Jr., this film is an absolute blast. Do not miss it.8/10 stars if you like popcorn films, probably 5/10 otherwise.",8,1,1,8 May 2004
Saving Private Ryan," Stunning; should have won Best Picture
","Much has been said about the opening scenes of 'Saving Private Ryan'. Here's all you need to know about it; at preview screenings of it, some veterans who survived D-Day had flashbacks of their unimaginable experiences. Some couldn't bring themselves to watch. That being said, anyone who wasn't there on D-Day should see this film so they will have some small idea of what those brave soldiers went through. After the opening scenes, we get to the plot of the movie, the search for a young man whose brothers have all been killed in the war. A troop of soldiers is sent to bring this young man home. On the way, they question the validity of their mission; why risk a whole group of men to save one? It is a question that has no easy answer, for the characters or the audience.This is, in my opinion, the greatest movie about the Second World War ever filmed. It was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, but lost to 'Shakespeare in Love'. Why the Academy snubbed 'Saving Private Ryan' is a mystery and, again in my opinion, the biggest mistake the Academy ever made.",10,0,1,18 June 2002
Titanic," Titanically overrated
","Teenage girls spent an entire summer watching this movie; people flocked to it in unprecedented numbers; the Academy of Motion Pictures completely lost its head and awarded it Best Picture. All for a film that was little more than a poorly-written Harlequin Romance set on the greatest ship to never finish one voyage.This film could have been improved in so many ways:1) Punt the insipid fictional love story and focus on the real-life characters. The supporting cast playing the actual people on board the Titanic was, on the whole, a much better group of actors than the ones in the fictional love story. 2) Have somebody (anybody!) else play the role of Jack. Matt Damon would have been good, Joaquin Phoenix would have been better, but DiCaprio was a huge mistake.3) If DiCaprio is really a must, have him and Billy Zane switch roles. Zane is much better suited to the romantic lead role, and DiCaprio would have been perfect as an unlikeable, self-absorbed fop.4) The Captain should have been portrayed more as he was in real life, not as the confused, incompetent geezer the movie makes him out to be. Witness reports say that Captain Smith acted heroically and with honor; it is a disservice to his memory to portray him as this film does.After all this, I must admit that I did kind of like this movie. I just don't understand all the fuss over it, and I REALLY don't understand why it won the Best Picture Oscar. This is a good film, but it is far from being a great film.",6,2,3,18 June 2002
Gangs of New York," An American Masterpiece
","The depth and complexity of this movie is amazing. Scorsese truly succeeds in giving us a movie where the setting is as much a character as the people. Somehow the viewer comes to feel that this story couldn't take place anywhere else than New York.I loved the parallels in the lives of the two main characters. Bill the Butcher was defeated by Priest Vallon, but his life was spared. He then rose again to defeat and kill Priest. Amsterdam Vallon could have been killed once his treachery was revealed, but Bill spared him, and act which eventually spelled Bill's doom. The father-son relationships are also powerful. Young Vallon's love for his father drives him to plot Bill's downfall. To enact this revenge, he must get close to Bill. So close, that Bill starts to see Amsterdam as the son he never had. It also seems as though young Vallon has to fight his own growing affection for Bill in order to try and kill him.This film could be compared with Hugo's 'Les Miserables'. Both are stories of a set of people and how their lives are shaped by the time and place they are in, set against an epic backdrop of large-scale strife and turmoil. In Hugo's work, it is the lives and tribulations of Valjean, Javert, Marius, and Cossette set in revolutionary France, culminating in the battles at the barricades. In 'Gangs', it is the lives of young Vallon, Bill the Butcher, Jenny Everdeane, and Johnny Sirroco set in the slums of Civil War-era New York, ending with the Draft Riots.This movie is a masterpiece. I give it 10/10.",10,1,2,13 December 2004
Gladiator," Masterful historic epic
","Brilliant acting, brutal battle sequences, and a concise story propel 'Gladiator' to epic status, making it quite possibly the greatest epic of Ancient Rome ever filmed, rivalled only by 'Spartacus'.Russell Crowe proves himself to be one of the great actors of our time as he plays General Maximus, a man who only wants to live a quiet, peaceful life with his family. Instead, Maximus is hailed for his abilities in battle, first on the battlefield as he helps Emperor Marcus Aurelius expand the Empire, then in the gladiator arena after he is betrayed, sold into slavery, and forced to kill for the entertainment of the barbaric masses. Crowe shows us the General's quiet desperation to get home after the battle in Germania, his unimaginable shock at finding his family murdered, and his intense desire to avenge his family by killing Commodus, a range of emotions that many actors these days have trouble playing convincingly, but which Crowe handles perfectly.But a hero is only as good as his nemesis is bad, and Joaquin Phoenix portrays the insane Emperor Commodus flawlessly. Commodus is shown as more than a crazed dictator; he is shown as a young man who wanted to feel love from his father, but couldn't, even when his father tried to express his love for Commodus. His unsettling passion for his sister makes the audience dislike him, but his apparent love for his nephew makes him seem human, until he threatens the boy near the end. The audience comes to hate Commodus, but there is also a feeling of pity for him, and that is a hard balance for an actor to maintain. Phoenix shows that he has a long, impressive career ahead of him, and in my opinion, he should have been awarded the Best Supporting Actor Oscar when he was nominated for this role.Everything about this production is remarkable, from the almost Wagnerian score to the jarring choreography and cinematography of the battle sequences. A true masterpiece of movie making.",10,0,0,17 June 2002
