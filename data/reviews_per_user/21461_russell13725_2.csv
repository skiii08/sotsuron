Ford v Ferrari," Hated car movies... until this one popped up
","This kept my interest all the way thru. Even spiced up and glamorized for Hollywoods sake never caused me once to say as I always do 'C'mon, I mean really'... except maybe when Henry Ford II started balling like a baby. Hard to understand Bales English accent at times still wasn't even to much a bother since you were already so gripped in the movie by then. Damon pulled off the perfect car guy character and Fords top henchmen pulled off their roles as well. Very watchable movie and I know you will enjoy it too. Worth the watch.",10,1,2,8 March 2020
Yesterday," Is there anybody gonna listen to my story...
","Well ya should... cuz this was a well thought out and playful movie and worth a feel good watch. Gotta admit,,, best well acted movie by the two leads that ive seen in a long long while. How has nobody thought of this plot line for a movie before is beyond me but we finally have a funny Beatle movie that keeps you watching,,,, why,, because of the songs for one reason. There was one glaring error that caught me when they stumbled on to John Lennon but ill let you see if you can figure it out. My only hint is 'why them but not him.' Bottom line, if you want a great movie to watch (and lets face it not many coming out these days) then I would recommend 'Yesterday.' The only downside to this movie was the character played by SNL Kate McKinnon. An overplayed continuous character that youve seen her do on the show as well as any movie shes ever been in. If the movie itself wasnt this strong then she possibly could have sank the whole yellow submarine with her style.",9,0,1,28 September 2019
