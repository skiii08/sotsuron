National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Book of Secrets is Better than its proceeder!
","Let me summarize this first quickly; National Treasure: Book of secrets is a great fun BLOCKBUSTER movie and better than its proceeder! The only reason i capitalized blockbuster is because the movie is (obviously) not Oscar-worthy, but a great end to a year full fantastic movies! Critics might not have enjoyed it, but i recommend it if u're looking for what may have been a great entry this summer! The performances are good; Nicholas Cage is still enjoying his role, Bartha is funny, and Helen Mirren and Jon Voight are actually nice together! The plot is interesting, but the highlight of this movie is not only the jaw dropping breathtaking car chase in London, but the stunning scenes in Buckingham palace, in the white house(where it becomes comedic as Cage tries to steal a 'board' from the president's table while Diane Kruger seduces a guy who works there)and in the library of congress where he steals the Book of secrets (which i've never been to). I was waiting for the kidnap of the president, but I was a bit disappointed because he ends up not kidnapping him but taking him inside a cave and asks him about the whereabouts of the book(But that scene remains cool, and one of the best scenes in the movie) In addition to that, the movie features an amazing scene when the 4 characters try to maintain the balance of a swaying platform. (the city of gold is gold!) Even though the movie doesn't features lots of clues like the first one, it's better!",9,3,7,21 December 2007
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," One of the best video-game adaptations ever made; that's not saying much!
","Yes, I did realize going in that Prince of Persia is based on a video game of that same name, but I couldn't help but feel disappointed and unsatisfied! PoP is about Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal - who was miscast!) who becomes a fugitive after he is betrayed by one of his 'brothers' and is determined to return the Dagger that allows him to go back in time to its rightful place in order to keep it away from the villain who is keen on becoming king. (How he wishes to do that: I won't dwell on it!) He is escorted by a Tamina, a lovely princess (Gemma Arterton - who was seductive in Clash of the Titans, yet I couldn't help but squirm in my seat in this one because of her!).It is very predictable! I saw everything coming!Gyllenhaal , though he performs his stunts quite brilliantly, wasn't meant for this role! However, Ben Kingsley did a good job.Some of the action scenes are quite fun, I must admit! The run over the rooftop was captivating and the big finale was heart-pounding! (Though, some of the special effects looked really fake!) I tend to enjoy Jerry Bruckheimer's films, and , even though it had its fun moments,this is a disappointing outing from him. Don't see it, it can wait.(This is probably one of the best video game adaptation ever made, that's not saying much.)",4,1,2,25 July 2010
Salt," A Summer Film that Never Stops! A Ticking Time Bomb!
","I must admit that I was quite surprised at the fact that I thoroughly enjoyed Angelina Jolie's Salt! (Considering the fact that I entered the theater without expecting anything.) Salt is one hell of an action film! This is exactly what a summer film is all about! It never stops; you're barely given enough time to breath! In addition, amidst all of the gorgeous stunts and high-octane action scenes, Jolie stands out and gives it her best; she is truly incredible! I won't waste that much time on the plot: It's mainly about Evelyn Salt, a CIA officer, who is accused of being a Russian Spy taking part in the murder of the Russian President! (And who will help bring forth Day X). I will keep the rest for you to discover, for the plot twists are quite fun to behold , disregarding how implausible some of them seem.Actually, the film itself is implausible! Not only do the plot twist go all over the place, (and get more ridiculous as you go along) the action scenes are off-of-the-top! However, Salt is like a ticking time bomb; from the moment the interview with Orlov starts, hold on cause it is going to be one-hell of a ride! You rarely find films like this!Angelina is brilliant! Her stunts are awe-inspiring and she shows everyone how it's done! She pours a lot into her character! In the end, leaving the theater, all you'll be thinking about is her and the great work she's done! Nobody goes into a summer film expecting something smart or a character-based flick; let's face it, we see for the action and the fun of it! Regardless of all of its ridiculous moments, this does it! One of the best summer offerings so far (excluding Inception and Toy Story 3, of course). Don't miss this popcorn film! (make sure you leave your brain at the door.)",8,18,36,25 July 2010
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," An Enchanting Film That Will Stand the Test of Time
","Before I saw TCCOBB, I was surrounded with so many negative reviews that I even at one point last hope in this film. All I heard was: 'It's too long', or 'It's pointless'. Yes, opinions do differ, but people were totally panning the film! Until I saw the film, and I was in awe! The film is enchanting and magical. It follows the entire life of Benjamin Button; a man born in his 80s and ages backwards. The plot is a fantasy, but it is so well-treated that you get so sucked in and enjoy the film. Many themes run throughout the film, most notably death, loss and forbidden love.Brad Pitt gives the performance of a lifetime! Brilliant! Taraji also shines as Queenie, she gives this character a huge heart, and she's like an angel! Blanchette also did a great job (An Oscar nomination would have been well-deserved).David Fincher adds a magic to this film that is so rare in movies! He was robbed! The screenplay's pretty good, and there are some killer lines! he he THe visuals are stunning! The make is awe-inspiring! The sets and costumes are gorgeous! The scenery is stunning, and the score was stuck in my mind! TCCOBB is a magical film, not to miss! Should have won many more Oscars. Dunno why all of the negative commentaries! It will live forever.P.s: Prepare yourself for many tear-jerking moments!",10,0,3,12 March 2009
Avatar," A Journey Beyond this World!
","A lot of hype has been building up around 'Avatar', James Cameron's return behind the camera, so, without question, I was there opening night! Luckily, in my country, the movie was released one day earlier than US. (Since movies are released here on Thursdays, not Fridays.)In short, Avatar has got to be my favorite movie experience ever which I can't wait to experience again and again.I'll drewl over the awe-inspiring, jaw-dropping visuals later on, but now let's focus abit on the plot, shall we? In several critics' reviews, I noticed that they mentioned the movie lacked depth. I disagree. (I'll try my best to keep this review spoiler-free.) It's future Earth, and the plot revolves around Jake Sully, a marine who lost the ability to walk. He is sent to replace his recently dead brother on a mission that involves him flying over to Pandorum ,which is inhabited by the indigenous population called the Na'vi, in an avatar body, a human mind in an alien body. Through a chain of events, he meets Neiriti (did I write that correctly?, well who cares?) who for a certain reason (which I shall NOT spoil) decides to help him learn their culture and ways, only to find himself torn between two worlds. (Abit 'Dances with Wolves'-ish, eh?). Humans are in desperate need for natural resources which this world provides, but there's a scared bond (religion) between the population there and the nature.In my opinion, James Cameron brilliantly wrote Jake Sully. He made him 3-dimensional (no, not with those glasses). You're rooting for him. He also focused on Neiriti which I will even go ahead and said looked sexy!My only issue is that the movie has several cheesy lines and moments. (But, I mean, check out Titanic for crying out loud. Cheesy but with 600 million $ in the bank.) He created an entirely new world, creatures, a language (fan boys, brace yourselves!), and a religion! The religion really interested me! (Being a committed catholic myself, couldn't help but find it delicious.) Now I come to the visuals, and what gorgeous effects they are!This will change cinema as we know it!I'm speechless actually! The 3D glasses are not used for pointless being thrown at you, but so that you become immersed in this stunning world! As I left the theater, I felt like I was leaving Pandorum and coming back home!WOW! You must see this! Missing it out is a crime in my opinion! The 3 hours fly by instantly!Everything looks so real! Even the Na'vi, once you get used to the fact that thy're big and blue, are stunning. The attention to details is 'fantabulous'.The colors, the plants, the creatures all tell you one thing; 'Sit Back , and ENJOY!' Avatar is an event! You do not want to miss it! I can't wait to see it again! The stunning effects and the plot (oh and let's not forget the cast, especially Sam Worthington!!! )will take to another world! Avatar is the new King Kong on top the Empire state Building, the new castle in Oz, the new King of the World!",10,7,13,18 December 2009
Inception," Inception: One of the greatest thrillers of all time?
","I walked into the movie theater where they were screening Inception, not knowing a thing! The only trailer I had seen then was the teaser (where they don't give out any details on the plot or etc.) . All I knew was that , visually, it looks mesmerizing. The reason why I didn't watch any of the trailers or read the synopsis is because lately I've been going into movies without knowing a thing, hence as it unfolds , I would enjoy it even more. As I watched Inception unfold in front of me, I forgot everything around me, and slowly began to realize what a genius Nolan truly is.The beauty about Inception is how the story slowly reveals itself. Nolan never gives everything away instantly. So, I'm gonna be quick and brief in order not to ruin your experience: In the future world (where there are no big pointless gadgets, but slick and cool architecture), we have a technology that allows us access into one's dreams. It is usually used in order to extract ideas from ones brains. Cobb (Dicaprio) is a man who gets one last chance to return home when he is asked to implant an idea (into who's mind and etc , I'll leave that to you to find out.) by assembling a team and dive into that person's dreams.However, the story is much more complicated than that. This film has big brains; and you need to focus thoroughly in order to keep up with what's going on. However, My God what a movie! When I first got what the film really is about (since , I repeat, I didn't know a thing) I almost jumped out of my seat and began cheering...almost. It keeps on unfolding and Inception is like an onion; there are layers after layers. It keeps you wondering and leaves the answers to you.Dicaprio gives one hell of a performance!! This is probably his best! He is having one hell of a year, and by God if he doesn't get an Oscar nom...His expressions are priceless! His eyes express everything so easily!Cotillard is creepy as hell (not going to ruin it, unless you already know) and also worthy of a nom. Ellen Page and the rest of the cast excel! Joseph Gorden Levitt gets to be part of the craziest action scene ever! (The one with the spinning hallway...oh, and as he flew through the corridors and etc.) Nolan is a genius. It is said that this took him 10 years to write! We are surrounded with remakes, sequels, book and TV-shows adaptations, and the films based on nothing are 3D crap. However, without the help of 3d, he created an amazing story and a visually immersing experience! The folding of Paris, the paradox staircases (only to name a few) are proof of his creativity. In addition, this is one hell of psychological thriller. It's in depth study of Cobb's mind...and ours!He keeps you on the edge of your seat, waiting to know what's gonna happen next...Brilliant! The visuals are stunning, and so is Zimmer's score. Wally Pfister's work here is outstanding! He better get a nom, at least. The Art Dirction is what caught me the most as a matter of fact! The sleek cool style is tempting! I made a list of the best films of the last decade, and I believe this beats all of them! Intelligent, thrilling...I might even go ahead and say that this is one of the greatest thrillers ever made! (And not getting it isn't an acceptable reason for not liking it.) Bring on the Oscars!! Now, there's a debate as to how the film ends, and , point is, we'll never really know. I'm gonna stick to the ending that makes this film even more intriguing...Definitely worth multiple viewings! This film, not only does it dwell into Cobb's mind, it's one of those rare psychological thrillers where Nolan toys with you! The entire time Cobb (and you) is lost as to what is real and what is a dream. In the end, you realize that it's you who is stuck in that conundrum...",10,2,6,1 August 2010
Despicable Me," Despicable Me: Cute but nothing more.
","I am simply baffled by the amount of (over-the-top) praise this film has received! It is ludicrous! Despicable Me is an average movie, nothing more (don't be fooled by the critics) nothing less.DM is a cute film. The lush blending of colors is truly eye-popping; however, the animation isn't necessarily top-notch! I couldn't help but compare the animation to that of Toy Story 3 and feel disappointed! However, the 3D is truly state of the art! (Make sure you stay during the credits in order to be blown away!) The film orbits around Gru, the 2nd greatest criminal in the world, who wants to perform the crime of the century; steal the moon! He is helped by his loyal legion of (VERY adorable) minions who are the main generators of laughs through-out the film! The film-maker found a brilliant way to make the audience fall for the evil master-mind; imposing upon him the task of taking care of the 3 orphans.Some jokes are a big success, while others are tired out gags that fall flat on their faces. Their isn't much focus on plot here, but , let's cut tot the chase, the only people who know how to mix plot with great emotional core is Pixar! (It goes without saying, anyways). In other words, don't walk into the theater expecting a masterpiece.)Several people have enjoyed this film - including me- but I didn't find anything here worth of excessive praise. A kid sitting next to me kept on jumping in his seat,laughing hysterically; he truly enjoyed it and was captivated by it. I, perhaps, enjoyed watching the film succeed in making kids laugh rather than watching the film itself...",6,17,33,13 October 2010
