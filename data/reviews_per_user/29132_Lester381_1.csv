Requiem for a Dream," If you're looking for a great date movie, look elsewhere
","I just watched Requiem for a Dream at a sneak preview.  Going into the film I had high expectations, but let me just say that the film surpassed all of them.  This film WILL GET TO YOU! Watching the main characters slowly destroy their lives from drugs is not an easy thing to sit through, especially the way it is portrayed on screen.  Anyone who is taking drugs or is even considering taking drugs should view this film.  I know people who are faced with the reality and consequences of drug addition and drug abuse. Sadly, this film accurately portrays the affects.  It is an important film that needs to be seen.The writing, directing and acting is the best.  Even Marlon Waynes brings his acting status to a new level. But when Oscar time rolls around, I don't know how the film will sit well with the voters.  But one thing is for sure, the editing and cinematography should be shoe-ins for nominations as well as Ellen Burstyn's performance!  My God... she HAS TO BE NOMINATED to say the least.  The haunting images and fantastic score will forever be in my mind.After my friends and I left the theatre, no one was talking... we were still absorbing the film.  This film is truly an EXPERIENCE unlike any other. It is shocking, scary and horrifying- several people covered their eyes during scenes. Be careful going into this film and keep an open mind. Remember, it was going to be rated NC-17, but Artisan decided to keep the film as it was and release it as 'Unrated.' This was smart on Artisan's part b/c if the film had been edited down to an R rating, the affect wouldn't have been as great thus the entire point of the film might have been lost. Bravo to the filmmakers and everyone who worked on this film for taking the chance and making an extremely risky film. It is truly in a class of its own.Unless you have no soul, I guarantee it will move you and leave you stunned by the time the end credits roll.  It is a very, very TOUGH film to sit through and IMPOSSIBLE to forget. One of the best films of the year, right next to Almost Famous.  I highly recommend it- with caution.",10,1,1,20 October 2000
