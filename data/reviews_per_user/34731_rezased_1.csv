The Equalizer," superficial
","The virtue of helping the unprotected and tendency of eradicating roots of evil shown in the film is respectful , but the role played by Denzel was very clich√©d . Another minus point is that the idea is that devil is from Russia.To cast the blame on a source out of the society.confession of the ex KGB agent regarding that he has no emotions irritates the audience to induce and generalize this notion to Russians.finally , I was expecting a much more sophisticated movie when I saw Denzel Washington was the actor.It is just good for entertainment as superficial as Bollywood films .",Null,0,0,23 June 2016
