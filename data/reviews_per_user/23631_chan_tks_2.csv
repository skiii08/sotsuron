First Man," Different perspective on Neil, however flatline dull.
","The focus on Neil provides a different perspective showing him as a man overcoming normal challenges. The significance of his task and the space race is less prominent as compared to other films.Although these draw you closer to Neil's personal life this movie is unnecessarily slow paced and dull. Especially when there is minor change in dynamics, this can frustrate the audience to ponder and ask what is scriptwriter and director trying to portray.Overall enjoyable for space enthusiasts, minus the action and drama.",4,12,22,24 October 2018
A Quiet Place," Good concept but frustrating and irrational.

<ul><li>Remove irrational and illogical scenes. A lot of scene you will raise eyebrows and ask... really? This made it very frustrating to watch.</li><li>Poor ending, appears to be a rush ending. Could have shown the struggle and development better. </li><li>Tacky techniques to reveal information about the aliens.</li></ul>",2,0,2,26 August 2018
