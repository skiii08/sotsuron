First Man," Sublime, yet slow.
","It's not very original. The story moved kinda slow. What it gets right is the pure anxiety of the lunches, of the dangers of the situation plummeting into outer space. It's also quite beautiful, stunning, the moon scenes are literally out of this world in all senses. In the end, it could have stood to be a bit more compelling. The directing, the acting, it all pulls in when it should.",8,0,0,13 August 2019
John Wick," A simply told, brilliantly made, action movie milestone.
","Fun, just fun. Not your typical action movie. Not messy like a lot of them are typically now. The fighting and gunplay is very smooth, yet also highly graphics and violent. The story, about a retired hitman seeking revenge over the death of his dog, is simple, but since Jon Wick is portrayed as a tragic, sympathetic character, its good enough. Reeves also turns in a surprisingly good performance. If nothing else, this movie deserves respect for its attention to detail. These filmmakers really know what they are doing, they craft and layer this thing with a passion that makes it highly pleasurable to view, right down to the subtitled conversations, being very in sync with whoever is speaking, to a degree that makes reading them faster. That's what this movie is, fast, quick, constant action, with a simple effective story and great performances, also with a passion and professionalism that makes it stand out from the rest. It has earned its spot as a milestone for the genre, based on that alone.",10,4,6,28 May 2019
A Star Is Born," A sweet, charming, real film of success.
","This is a very sweet and sad movie. It has great songs, great performances. A love story that is founded on some truly great chemistry between our two leads. It is a good story of success. Troughout the film we see these two grow apart and grow back together, Lady Gagas character becomes increasingly more famous, leaving Bradley Cooper in the back, who is a character who I was curious about, as we know little about him but are let in on the fact that he is a very sintmental person and a highly tragic one with a backstory of depression and drunkenness. You did feel sorry for him. You feel sorry for him as you feel good for her as she gets that success. When they are together, signing or simply hanging about, things get to a rather tender sate, to a rather sweet time. It is a movie of moments like that. It has a classic quality to it to from that.Also being expertly directed, Cooper also serves as the man behind the camera here, and he frames and puts all the passion and vsison right in front. At the end it proves a sad tale, a tale of making something special, having something to say, never getting lost in an image. It is far to charming and enduring in its message and in its execution for me to not it to much for a bit of predictability now and then. Everything that works works much to well. The songs also, are truly beufiul, original, and real. Cooper set out to gives us this story, and it proved well.",9,0,0,14 June 2019
Mulan," Fun little adventure.
","First take: admittedly not one of my favorite films Disney has done, mostly serviceable, yet also, like with most of their films, there is an easy, watchable likeability to it, and it's never boring, it just didn't live up to other standards I may unrealistically have set.The acting: the main lead is great. She's charming and has a great voice for a kit of the songs. As do the rest. We have to sidekicks and meaning if not a tad over the top villains, and they are playing well, despite a dose of stock.The songs:
All great, all memorable, here we are treated to 3 tracks that are very catchy indeed. They all progress the story and comment on the situation. The standout is easily Make a man out of you.The Animation:
Classic hand drew beauty here. A lot of backgrounds the leap out due to their sheer size, plenty of expressive faces and a nice imperial aesthetic that blends well with the culture however accurate.The story:
Maybe it doesn't hold up as much now or has been done so many more times and better, but a story of female empowerment, especially back then, before it really blew up, should be praised and respected. Also, a character who fights for her family and what's right.Final take:
Not one loved as many others, but it is perfectly fine for anyone really. It has a nice story and good songs and looks gorgeous, but maybe after time, it proves a bit serviceable.",8,0,0,9 July 2019
Captain Marvel," Remember, strength means no emotion.
","Not good. One of my least favorite in the MCU so far. The boring, bland story, hyping itself on 90s nostalgia, intending attempts at emotion and heart but making the lead actress remain stoic and wodden despite the story trying to be about her overcoming a need to hide. The story is underwhelming, no new beats or takes, just standard jumping between, hey you know this character is important right, we need you two, more goddam flashbacks. The actors are all talented but you won't know that watching this movie. Even Slj bored me here, and the reason he wears the eye patch, just terrible. As for Larson, she tries and is funny and their is one scene that is pretty effective emtioanlity wise, other than thast, another stoic badass performance, which I don't blame her for, its been a sick trend with Hollywood writers for a while now. Overall not good, one of the few mcu films that are straight-up bad.",5,3,7,23 October 2019
Brokeback Mountain," Forbidded, secret love.
","I loved this movie. It was tragic, sweet, and full of depth. The way Jack and Enis share this unique love over the years. The way they try at individual lives, at individual relationships, and fail, only to come back got each other is that much purer. They have a connection, a need, to be with each other, to take brakes in themselves from lives they lead and don't enjoy. The actors do such a good job at conveying all of this. From the loneliness to the failed love. There are messages here, ones that should always be listened to. They speak of warning to fully arrange something like this should it appear in your life. To fully embrace it. The way it ends in tragedy is also adding to this, leaves one feeling sad and depressed.Everything about the way it is even made is one of quiet, one of always letting the viewer know of all of these things that are truly the essence of what two drifters in life, to loners are feeling on the inside. I feel for them and their failed love. I marvel at how well it was executed. It was a powerful story told in secret corners of a hidden life. One that always should have seen the light of day.",10,0,0,25 May 2019
Aquaman," It's good, very good.
","This movie was a lot of fun. Jason Momoa killed it in the lead role was funny and badass. Him and Aber Heard also had some charming and even cute chemistry. The effects and action are also serviceable exciting but nothing mind-blowing. Atlantis looks beautiful if not a little busy. This is a CGI heavy film, but that's hardly at fault since there is really no other way to faithfully present such an imaginative landscape as it takes place in.There is also a level of the heart to it that is simple, but effective enough. It's not without its cheesiness though, lots of over the top creatures, and Patrick Wilsons villain, but they all fit. At the end of it, all this film can be viewed simply as a fun, creative action romp with a good deal of exaggerated landscapes and the characters found in those landscapes that seem to know what kind of movie they're in. It's epic and fun and, despite the simple tired story, is one of the DCEUs better outings. It has a color where the others were grainy and charisma where the others were stoic. A solid change of pace.",8,3,7,1 May 2019
Tangled," Likeable
","That's really the best way to describe this movie. With Disney, you usually get movies that can be described this way. Their films, mostly their animated films, have a good streak of fun, cute, funny, and adventure titles that usually feature great theatrical music, and some rather impressive animation to boot.Most all of this can be said for Tangled, as well as it's an admittedly predictable plot. Yes, we have them all is lost moments and a typical story of someone wanting more out of life. Where this film successes in the chemistry between the two leads. Rapunzel and Flynn are really good together. They bring in plenty of laughs and even some rather touching moments in the end. It is all simple, but there is something in that chemistry for everyone.That's what I liked about it, even more, there is not too much childishness. It all evens out, and I did have a good time with it and would say to give it a watch if you haven't yet.",8,1,1,10 April 2019
Nightcrawler," The world of news, the death of moral.
","This is the kind of movie we need to both watch for and always try to project. It is beating with originality and raw force of Storytelling power and a certainly needed ability to throw the audience into a side of life that exists totally within our need for violence and our want to always see it and see it plentiful.Here we have Jake Gyllenhal playing a rather mysterious character that we immediately know is ultimately up to no good despite is Passion despite maybe possibly wanting to do good in success. this character is highly intelligent, highly educated, and highly confident in his speech and Carries himself brilliantly everywhere he goes. where he goes is a peek behind the curtain and the News industry and the need to get a story 4 furthering that need for violence and for the crime. It shows how moral is almost basically non-existent. People are stories nothing more and nothing less. There's a whole team of various reporters various new screws going out to the city at night and trying to find any wrongdoing any chaos or any destruction or any active violence that they can use for that said story.Everything here is so brilliantly done from The Shear Excellence of the acting by our lead Lewis Bloom played by Jake Gyllenhaal, to the constantly moving script by Dan Gilroy who also very well directed the film.. he captures The Nightlife of the city of Los Angeles with absolute realism and absolute Grit. There are really no good guys in this story, everyone is full of greed. That's is what makes it so brilliant. It works on all these levels. Rather it wants to be a piece on the world of news and our need for it or a story about the disintegration of humanity from that. It even has a bit in here about how to create a business and expand it. All of the thrills come from our leaders, who are consistently determined and shockingly so.That is what makes this a brilliant movie. It works on all of these levels and is greatly benefitted from all the talent aborad. Destined to become a modern classic it just might be.",10,2,3,16 July 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," It's a leap of faith.
","First, take: I loved this movie. On a simple front its a Great, wholesome, genuine take on the iconic comic character that has a lot of heart and laughs. More in-depth though it's a deeply good story of taking a leap in life. Pushing beyond boundaries and becoming something big, something you can do no matter what or who you are. It has a. Real charm to the animation, a visual comic. Colorful as hell, creatively over the too, yet also smooth in its action and sharp in its wit. There is a lot to get into here, so let's do it.The acting:
All across the board solid. Every character has their own personality. From loners and outcasts to caring and composite father figures, to brave friends. Everyone has their time to make the viewers laugh and even cry, all the wide array of voice talent makes this all the truer. Even Nicholas Cage is genuine in this, playing this dark, brooding, noir version of Peter Parker, in a way a critique of overly edgy stories usually found in this subgenre.The writing:
Sharp as a tack. It has a fair dose of heart and humor. The heart is portrayed from family love to friendship, to bravery. The humor is portrayed from light-hearted, to even meta and satire. All comes in just when it needs to and never stays too long. The dialogue also always helps it.The Directing:
Same with the writing, on point. A good deal of prediction came into this, getting all of the angles and cutting right, making everything always feel quick yet smooth, well paced and never slow. It appears like a visual comic, literally, with the word bubbles and the bursts of bright light and flashing color. It all works together with each little interval. Some of the shots are stunning, most of them leap off.The Animation:It's everywhere. The characters are drawn with the top-notch expression and flowing movements. Calm and then hyper. Keeping the focus on what the charters are doing, and this is never hard to make out. Also, again, the color, everywhere in this one.The story:
It's been told before sure, but like any old story, there is always potential to do something with it and this movie does. Combines with all the shared universe elements, breaking out of boundaries seems far more at home with itself. This world seems the right place to do it, as anywhere is. It seems its own place of imagination. Almost private, and when we see that change happens in the end, we that point of becoming this fantasy happens, we get behind it, young and old. All the needed emotional moments are their and effective as always. Even if the story has been told, it is still working.Final take:
This movie was basically perfect. Everything worked here. It was precisely put together, stunning to look at, fun to watch, likable in its story and its education all across the board. A fun film for all really.",10,1,4,8 July 2019
Black Snake Moan," Another moving southern blues mobile.
","A great, deep, richly told narrative set in the south. Gonna have to check out more of what this done, cause his work here is quite new and impressive to watch. He captures blues culture quite realistically. This film is not quite down and dirty, yet still, the rebel atmosphere is all over the place.The character work as well, unpredictable, deep. We have Christine Ricci in a very as a sort of nymphomaniac. Someone who can't seem to turn off those impulses and overtake her. Jackson plays aging down on his luck blues singer. He finds her and sets to clearing her of her wicked ways. Yet he is not perfect either. He has a falling marriage, yet keeps to the right.The way all of these things leap in and out of each other is right where it needs to most all the time. The acting as well, all-around good. Chemistry solid, Rccis southern accent, unrecognizable, wonderfully vulnerable. Of course, simply have to address Jacksons singing voice, so damn good. I'd listen to a whole album with it.In the end, this not quite a love story, not quite a music film. It is about failed love, human wickedness, and using the sounds of the south to get back to those things respectively. It may not be perfect, the pacing could use some work, also a few awkward moments If attempted comedy, yet it still works great for all the others. If you go for these sort f stories, this may not go in your shelf with the best of them. Still, it may fall in somewhere down the line.",8,4,6,12 August 2019
Big Fish," Fiction is the truth inside the lie.
","Life is boring, we all know that it's is the very reason most flock to the
realm of fiction, why stories exist. To escape, to break through the boredom, and find the realm of journey underneath. This is an old statement, all know it by now. What is perhaps less known is that the stories often tell truths? They exaggerate, sure, but they give the feeling of life, brought up more, enhanced, to make entertaining.This whole movie bases itself around not that idea alone. It makes a lesson from it. Stating within that if you listen to these stories you'll realize the truth in them, what they meant to the subject, how they have a power that can last forever, based on that truth.It says about how feelings are misplaced, Repackaged, told out of order to serve these means. What is a myth, what is the fact? What is a metaphor, are these all literal? These stories, can they help to understand in depth what mundane reality can't touch. Throughout the story of Mcgergors character, we see that yes indeed it does, and can last forever. Movies like this are teaching good morals, executing them well, and getting to that sentimental side, and reminding of the realness within, that makes a great juxtaposition and a brilliant movie.",10,0,0,20 September 2019
Quiz Show," Decent.
","This movie was just fine. It had a good through line, a solid story of corruption and dectiet and the game shows were certainly doing a good deal in ways of making the film engaging. The likes of Ralph Fiennes and John Turturro give terrific dramatic performances in it. Unfortunately, the film was not too special to me. I brought up the whole thing with the system behind the game shows, the dynamic there, and while it is still well done , I have seen it before and nothing really makes it stand out too much. That whole commentary on the mind-controlling television is growing stale. Not a bad film, just one I personally felt was a bit ordinary.",7,0,0,26 April 2019
The Fly," Classic Sc fi\ Horror, classic many fares.
","Classic. It's gross, has great effects. The process of Jeff turning into this infused fly is packed with suspense and gross-out horror. It has a sci-fi element, introducing some form of science and invention. It is also fairly sad as he has a bit of a romance with Geena Davis character. It's has a good dose of tragedy to it as well as being creepy and intriguing and expertly directed by David Cronenberg. That's all I got, brief words to be sure, but, Alas, those are my thoughts. It's a great movie, for both of its genres.",9,1,1,23 April 2019
Limitless," Weird, yet creative.
","I love all the ideas this film presented to us when it was talking about the drug and how it changes Eddie's life. All the camera work of how he moves tough time quicker grows smarter, and. Gets richer, this is all over creative and well made. However, faults come to be in a rather muddled plot, that gets lost inside a story of drug dealers and even stock brokerage. It has a very crazed tone, though you could argue that's part of its charm. It is indeed an interesting expiracne. One with a clear motive, and brilliant performances, yet, I cannot help but feel that there is some need to show off to much.",7,0,0,23 May 2019
Wedding Crashers," Stupid, but, thankfully, a fun side of stupid.
","For every dirty sex joke and every dirty does of crude crass humor, there is the potential for a laugh, there are laughs, and then there is fun. It's a simple premise, with an even simpler execution. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson crash weddings and get laid, get involved with a rich family, they both sort of fall in love with two daughters of said family, and potentially do sole searching.What made this one work is the goofy nature of its comedy. All of the humor styles I hinted at are executed with the pure persoona, with pure energy. Both of the leads are fun to watch. Their system for crashing weddings, while a bit of a stretch, is so committed, you can't help but go along with it. The Bradley Copper character is so unlikeable and irritating every time he is on screen, yet he is played to such a delightfully slimy t I have to give credit.Everyone's putting forward effort here, to make us laugh, and while this is hardly a cackling till you tear up kind of affair I had fun with it. It's a damn fine little comedy with a ton of persona, though a predictable story is still present, it remains a great example of two leads really making a movie.",8,2,2,9 May 2019
Joker," Makes a great character study and executes a brilliant film.
","Not only is this a great comic book movie, it's a great movie, by all standards. One that would come in the 70s , looking like it, acting like it, by the biggest hits of it's cinematic output. This is not a pleasant movie to sit through. It depicts a persons slip from sanity in a way that makes you go from fearing for him to those who oppose him. Not in a way the celebrates these vile acts he commits. It knows the tragedy of the character, and uses it to create a genuinely impactful character study and form a cationary tale around it.Though it was questioned rather comedy director Todd Phillips would be able to bring the chops needed for such a story. Such worries are moot, once the brutal grittyness, the nastyness the visaeral execution of these things play out. It's well as well, moving in a slow burn to bursts, akin to the characters own mind, before it snaps at the end.Carrying this all is Phaqin Penoix, who is meanicing, unnerving, yet with a dose of fun and sympathy. He's creepy to watch and owns every scene, carrying the whole film as it's star. A film that is deserving of praise , makes you think, creates uncomfortable questions, and executes it's intentions valiantly. This one is a keeper every film buff should see.",10,1,1,5 October 2019
Army of Darkness," Crazy, it knows it and works because odd it. Rami trilogy ends with a bang.
","This movie is just but, that's all can say. 81 minutes of our, high energized insanity. It's confused about itself. Does it want to be a midlevel picture, a goofy comedy, a gore splashed horror fright fest? These are, but here I can't really complain. It all so unapologetically  insane, and it knows it. From that, I help but want more and more. The first two films in this series kind of get this too. Yet here it's much more personified.Rami is a quite interesting filmmaker. His directing techniques are very low quality, that too adds to the charm. of dutch angles and clever camera movements. He really knows how to make a scene move and move fast. Of course, we need to have a talk about the one and only Bruce Campbell. He carries the film quite naturally. He is at his most funny and schematic of the whole series here. He makes me laugh and get behind him when he makes commentary on the of whatever situation he finds himself in, just that good constantly with him.In the end, this is a short film, it goes by in a snap, and I enjoyed every minute. If your a horror fan, and want one that serves as a great one of those and a great fun time, this is the movie possibly.",10,1,2,7 August 2019
"Hail, Caesar!"," Nothing really happens.
","As a fan of the Coen Brothers work, I have to admit to being a little let down by this entry. To me, this film was love letter to Hollywood that seemed to forget to have an actual story around the various odes to classic cinema that surrounds it. There are some attempted funny moments, and the film sure is gorges to look at, as one would expect from something put together from Roger Deakins. It does for sure make itself highly respectful to that golden age Hollywood scene, capturing all the magic and the wonder that was in cinema at that time, and I always enjoy peeking behind the curtian to see the inner makings. We also have a large cast of good actors attempting to make it all work.Where this film falls flat is all down to the writing. Basically, there is no story to this movie, at least, not a very good or memorable one, it does not get above the flash, it always loses flair. There are attempts to make commentary on the red threat which was big in Hollywood at that time, but they really do nothing with it, and all the odes feel quite forced and shoved in. It is all very surface.This is a well made movie. A well acted movie. Basically everything in this movie works except the storytelling, which needs to be strong, to a certain level, for it all to bookend.",5,0,2,19 April 2019
Kingpin," Serviceable comedy.
","It's perfectly fine. Has some intelligence and wit to it. Some crude and crass humor, all of the actors do a good job. With this one, however, it was mostly a stake comedy. It kind of lingered around scenes too long and I only laughed a few times, more chuckled. It works as a good movie about bowling with a little bit of a mean spirited edge, and a lot of personalities mostly, it is just decent in its execution. What it does do well is making itself a little held back in it's a comedy. The Farrelly Brothers typically like to go over the top with gross-out humor, and that is not as present here, which is a nice change of pace, not enough, however.",7,0,1,11 July 2019
Murder on the Orient Express," Not too good, I do prefer the original.
","This film, from renowned actor\director Kenneth Branagh, is sorta let down for many reasons. First, it makes far too many unnecessary changes. The ending, in my opinion, was done so much better in Lumet's original, it's much more subtle. While the ending here has pretty much the same meaning, it's a little overdone and melodramatic. The directing as well I feel is a bit on the showy side, lots of weird angles that don't seem to serve any sort of a creative purpose, other than to show off how clever the cameramen can frame scenery.Speaking of the scenery, that's where I will lead into my positives. This film is gorgeous, the winter months, the sense of isolation, even the way the trial is filmed in these are damn good, as are some of the cities and locations we visit at the beginning. The acting as well is across the board impressive. We have to likes Of Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Jonny Depp, Penelope Cruz, and even Josh Gadd, an actor most known for his more comedic roles, is even good here. The weakest length is, unfortunately, our leading man, his accent was kind of overdone to me, he has his moments, and I would not call him bad, but that was a distraction.All in all, this film really did not need to be made. The only reason I can think off is maybe Branagh wanted to make a closer adaptation of the book by Agatha Christie, which is a sound reason to do a film like this, however, I've heard it's not that at all, (I kind of have to trust other readers here, as I have not read it myself, for the time being). That's kind of the biggest problem with it. It has its good qualities and is perfectly watchable, but it fails to have any sort of a reason to exist. I would say it a rental, but I am more inclined to persuade you to rent the original film.",6,1,2,25 April 2019
Lord of War," One of Cages better ones.
","It is indeed quite easy to poke fun at some of the cages more laughably bad roles that he has taken as of late. However, all the memes and the like should never take away from the fact that he can actually be a good actor sometimes, hell, even a damn great one, like he is in this.This film follows the life of a Ukrainian man who sells guns to various dictators and militants and eventually becomes the main financier of bloodshed and combat in many warring countries. Knowing that it is easy to see his character as irredeemably evil. He sells these weapons with full knowledge innocent people will likely die because of it and does it anyway, he sees it as a business. That's what makes him that much more of an interesting character. He sees the prospect of arms dealing as a pure money making affair, with no attached desire to get involved with any of the conflict that makes his business necessary. He goes from country to country, getting all down in the nit and grit of the monstrosities and genocides committed, and still leaves with the cash and returns home to great riches and a loving family.This is a pure character study of a film. It takes us through the eyes of cages character, who also narrated the film. We see his many complexes on how he believes arms dealers may be the only thing keeping a sort balance. How they may be more genuine then some prompted legal businesses. It has a good deal of violence and depravity to it, but also intrigue. This all comes down to cages brilliant performance, all the levels of cleverness and precision that make him fun to watch, and the rest of the movie, right along with all the uncomfortable states it outs you in and the questions it makes you ask there.",8,0,0,2 May 2019
Inside Llewyn Davis," A gloomy, inspired music scene
","With this one the Coens are taking a much more subdued approach to a story about music. Particularly the music of Llewyn Davis, a down on his luck former folk music singer. Shot at various small bars and in clubs and houses, this has all the look of the type of low budget feel of usual sundance fair, and that's why it works.
First of, their is a ton of goood music in here. If you're a fan of old times folk type music, you may find yourself enjoying this movie a little bit more. It also has at the level of a dark comedy about it to, but its alot ore underpayed here. I would not go as far as to calk this film boring, but it is quite slow, quite relaxed, and that too makes it feel calm and easy to watch , which is a positive for me. Its really a simple story, though told very well I would not call it anything special.",8,0,0,18 April 2019
