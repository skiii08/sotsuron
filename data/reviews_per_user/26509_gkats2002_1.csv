Resident Evil: Afterlife," Resident Evil, After......
","If After.... this fourth installment of the series, they make another one, I am surely to not watch this. As much as I enjoyed watching the first movie, and even the other two of the series, this one surely makes the worse of the four.Shot specifically to sell out as a 3D movie (and especially in Greece where I live they have this bad habit of translating the movie titles in whatever they think suits them, so the title was changed to Resident Evil: three dimensional escape!!!!!!! ), it doesn't even succeed in that. Silly action scenes, to facilitate the use of 3D, many clich√©s and non-existent dialog is what makes this film a total rubbish.There is so much exaggerating in this movie, that you just can't have any more. And there are times that it looks so bad, that it makes you wanna stop watching it.Too bad, because they cold make so much more from this franchise, if they really out some effort in it. I wont go into details, it isn't worth it. But have in mind, that there are better movies out there to watch, than this piece of nothingness!!!!",4,1,3,10 October 2010
