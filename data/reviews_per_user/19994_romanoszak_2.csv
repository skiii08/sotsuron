Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," A new era for our beloved pirates!!!!!!!!
","The first three films are now a big part of the history of cinema and no one can deny that. ''On Stranger Tides'' is a worthy sequel to those films.Of course, Johnny Depp is once again incredible amusing as Captain Jack Sparrow, showing you his acting skills one more time and why he was nominated for an academy award for best leading actor for the same role in the ''Curse of the Black Pearl''. Every time he is on screen, his presence is so entertaining, you'll just want more more of Captain Jack. So we have our favorite pirate back -who is also one of the most iconic character from the 2000's...but what else?Geoffrey Rush returns as the cold-blooded pirate captain, Hector Barbossa. This time his story is evolved just like in the previous films. From an evil villain, a guest star, and a tritagonist he has becomes now a huge supporting character. His performance is of course excellent, the motives of his character are very interesting and I give you my word, you will love his last scene!!!Penelope Cruz is better than I expected, I'll give her that. She manages to appear as the complete equal to Jack Sparrow's cunning and her role in the story is extremely important. Plus, she is so hot!!!But what is a good movie like this without a menacing villain? Ian McShane is perfectly cast as Blackbeard, the ''pirate all pirates fear''. Even from his first scene you realize that he's not messing around and that he will stop at nothing in order to get what he wants. The only bad thin about Blackbeard is that I expected him to be....more evil...don't get me wrong, he was very cruel, but still...The rest of the cast is very good as well. Kevin McNally is funny as hell in the role of ''master'' Gibbs, just like he was in the ''old days''. Astrid-Berges Frisbey is incredibly cute, hot as the mermaid Syrena and she gives us a very interesting sample of her acting skills. Sam Claffin is also very good as the priest caught prisoner by Blackbeard and falls for Syrena and he has some very well written scenes. Stephen Graham is incredibly amusing as Scrum replacing Pintel and Raggeti as a comic relief and Keith Richards, Richard Griffiths, Greg Ellis and Oscar Jaenada all have small but important roles. The writers Terry Rosio and Ted Elliot give us a clever script based on the novel ''On Stranger Tides'' and Rob Marshall directs in a very good way, just like Gore Verbinski.To sum it up, is very entertaining movie for every age and a worthy sequel to the previous films and it cannot be missed. It's not perfect, but it will make forget your problems and take a deep dive into the amusing world of the Pirates of the Caribbean.",7,0,1,13 June 2011
X-Men: First Class," They don't call it first class for nothing!!!!
","Another good X-men film, guys! I have to tell you, I saw this almost a week after its release and I thought ''the theater will be empty''. I was freaking wrong. Every one was there for this film, turns out X-men are pretty popular in my country too.When I first learned that this movie was in the works, I felt somehow disappointed. I hated ''X-men Origins: Wolverine'' and I always used to say ''why can't they just leave us with the original trilogy?''. I really liked the first three (X-3 was a bit of a let-down). But when I saw the movie I changed my mind. It was one of the best comic book movies I've ever seen!The casting was very good and the script is well written and it gives us a chance to see our beloved characters (Professor X & Magneto) back when they were young, friends and how/why they became adversaries. The CGI is incredible -might I say it's better than Thor's a bit- and the music very intense. But the best thing was the direction. Matheww Vaughn was better than I would have hoped, with incredible shots, characters' depth and a perfect tone for the film. It's not as dark as ''The Dark Knight'' but it wasn't as comedic as ''Fantastic Four''.The thing I enjoyed more was the characters they chose for the story. Every single mutant plays a pivotal role in the film. There is only a few things I didn't like. Magneto's uniform when he departs the team ( Ian McKellen's was better by far) and I expected Magneto and Professor X to be friends since 17-18 years old. This doesn't happen in this film. They meet each other far later. But their relationship is explored in very good way.To sum it up, either you are a comic book fan or not, you must go and see this movie. It's clever, it's entertaining and with a nice climax. It's worth it. You 're even gonna enjoy the little cameos they've put in there for comic geeks.....Go see it my friends...",8,3,8,16 June 2011
