Ali," A Wonderful, Beautiful,Moving and Timeless Celebration of Ali's life but with two major flaws
","This movie would be highly appreciated if it was just marketed as a celebration of Ali's life but unfortunately it wasn't it was marketed as a film to teach you more about Ali's life, which it doesn't. The film covers arguably Ali's most eventful decade 1964-1974 ending with Ali's world title bout with George Foreman and beginning with first world title shot against Sonny Liston. Will Smith, Jon Voight, Jamie Foxx and Mario and Van Peebles are outstanding in their roles of Muhammad Ali, Howard Cossell, Bundini Brown and Malcolm X respectively. The score is also excellent, the direction is also telling, but the second major flaw is the editing, where they skip straight from Ali's first loss against Frazier in 1971 to the Rumble in the Jungle in 1974 which as a result cuts out all of Ali's 'comeback period', and the film doesn't really then doesn't recover its boxing authenticity, also many people's criticism of the film is criticism of the man Ali himself not the film so that's disappointing. Apart from the editing and the marketing it was a perfect film about undoubtedly one of the finest athletes of the 20th Century. I highly recommend this film to those seeking a celebration of Ali's life but I won't to those seeking a better understanding.",10,1,2,27 May 2006
The Shawshank Redemption," A Truly Captivating, Uplifting and Important Masterpiece
","Captivating, Uplififting and Important are three adjectives most appropriate for this picture. Captivating as this film did literally hold me captive under Morgan Freeman's spellbinding narration in addition to his sublime acting from Freeman, Tim Robbins and the supporting cast. Uplifting as this film truly made hope spring eternal and has done for film-lovers across the globe. Finally this picture is important as there are many people in this world who have given up hope, are denigrated and dejected and may even feel that there life has no purpose but this film has renewed life to many people. It tells the story of Andy Dufresne(Robbins) who is convicted of murdering his wife and sent to Shawshank Prison for life and forms an unlikely friendship and bond with Red(Freeman) and his gang, who initially reject him, that's all I'll prefer to tell you of the film to maximise it's impact.",10,0,0,31 March 2006
