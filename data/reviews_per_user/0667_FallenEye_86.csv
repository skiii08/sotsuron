Changeling," Escorted, not Thrown... A Changeling.
","Perhaps we are so spoiled by the conditions of our time, with all this technology, social media and international network activity, that we are unable to - as fairly as possible, vividly imagine how possible it could've been in fact, to plant a child to pose as someone he is not, during a time that was incredibly technologically undeveloped, and where the human mind was more vulnerable to manipulation and fear. Even today, the human mind is still susceptible to both manipulation and fear, it's just that the attack and approach has matured with time.Yes, the neighbors and teachers and family could've come forward to corroborate Christine's claims, however, is it really a far stretch to believe that in that time, the world, countries, cities, towns and more specifically, neighborhoods, were filled with people who's mentality would be to 'stay out of matters that don't affect them, unless it's to judge and condemn', especially given how that was a period, where people would believe anything, no matter how apparently absurd?However, though I would love to give Changeling an 8 out of 10, it wasn't quite. Angelina was superb, Eastwood displayed some great work both behind the camera and with the composition, while Malkovich was also satisfactory, but sometimes the film felt a bit emotionally exhausting, and its resolutions weren't as satisfying as one would prefer. Also, the child actors could've been better, while the depiction of how the ranch story broke felt, slightly incomprehensible.I mean, the picture of the guy that was acting as if he didn't know where the ranch was, was on the wall in the house, and the detective looked right at it, and didn't bat an eyelid or find it strange? Instead, it was up to the boys' conscience to break the case, a case who's writing was on the wall. 7/10.",7,1,1,21 December 2018
Alien 3," Alien on 3-peat.
","How many times will this franchise keep fighting the exact same alien, in the same way, for the same reasons, by the same person.And how many times will Ripley keep bouncing around space, and landing everywhere but earth, and yet, everywhere she lands is always a place filled with people nonetheless?3 films, and still, nothing is known about anything. Alien is about fighting something we don't know or understand. Aliens is about fighting the same something we don't understand, and its family. Alien 3 is about fighting the very-same-something-we-don't-understand-like-in-Alien, except this time, instead of it growing in Kane, it's now growing in Ellen.The twist was cool, and I feel I would've seen it coming, had this film just not been such a bore, because of it being NOTHING MORE, absolutely nothing more, than its 2 predecessors.Alien, Aliens and Alien 3 is the same thing, over, and over, and over again... The 3rd time around was just too brutal to experience. Had it not been for the twist, this movie would've easily been a 4, but that twist helped quite a bit. 5/10.",5,0,3,8 May 2018
Captain Phillips," Two Green, One Red.
","Captain Phillips starts off on a very interesting note, then somewhere deeper into its voyage, it drops to a resting point. The first hour of this film is gripping, and somewhat tense, however, the last hour is, relatively monotonous.What plays well into Captain Phillips's hands is that it is a biography, but it being shot almost like a fictional action flick kind of withdraws some much needed emotional attachment and interest, at least to the level that is deserved and necessary.Performances were satisfactory all around, but, I fear Barkhad Abdi may have gotten an Oscar Nomination for all the wrong reasons, because though his performance was sufficient, it wasn't really Oscar material.This film hit some areas very well, but sadly missed others, and like the U.S. Navy, it struggled to target all the meaty points as needed; it seemed to have a target on one or two targets at a time, but never that elusive three, so with that said, a 6.6/10 rating would be fitting.",6,0,0,2 September 2017
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The War is Lost
","This movie, is not good. It's disjointed, feels very cheap(even for a 1999 film) and the acting, was incredibly scanty, all around... from Neeson to McGregor to Portman, and everyone else in between.The final fight scene was quite possibly one of the worst finales I've seen in my life. I really don't have much good to say about this movie, except maybe that, the fight between Kenobi and Darth Sidious was, especially for that time, awesome... And then it only lasted what felt like seconds.How this movie managed the Billion Dollar Mark, is beyond me... Even with considering the 2012 3D re-release and the fact that this movie is built upon a legacy, a Billion is STILL too much.The only person that should be happy with this movie is George Lucas, seeing as his bank account is well attached to it. Definitely, one of the worst movies I've seen.",2,1,4,5 December 2015
10 Cloverfield Lane," A Story About...
","A difficult film to rate, on the basis that 10 Cloverfield Lane is an entertaining and gripping watch, however, it is also an amazingly irritating rehash of sorts, of 2008's Cloverfield, that ends up elongating the already unanswered questions of its predecessor, while creating a mountain heap more.10 Cloverfield Lane unfortunately feels like a middle finger to fans and viewers. Two films in, and this series/franchise has literally said nothing about anything. The first time it was brilliant really, however with this film, it's extremely annoying, though still enjoyable. Cloverfield and 10 Cloverfield Lane's type of approach and mystery is VERY, VERY, VERY, reminiscent of Lost.At this point, given the angle this franchise is taking, it can keep going indefinitely, telling side stories that are around the main, and still unexplained, unanswered and unexplored story arc.Winstead and Goodman are great, true, but this film doesn't say anything, move anywhere and it accomplishes even less than what Cloverfield did. What is going on? What are these creatures and where do they come from? Hell, even if Trachtenberg and Co. didn't want to answer those particular mysteries as yet, almost 10 years later, then; Who is Howard? Did he kill the girl in the photo? Why did he lie about that girl being Megan? What is Howard's agenda? That injured woman, what happened to her? Even Emmett doesn't feel like he was fully developed, to point where it feels difficult to accept his death.Also, am I the only one confused by the end part of this film? An end part by the way, that kind of falls apart just a little bit too, during all that puzzlement.Thoroughly enjoyable movie, but, it says less, does less and accomplishes less, while creating more, and more, and more questions, that may never really be addressed, as there may be no reason to.10 Cloverfield Lane has positioned itself as a movie that is either pretty great, or annoyingly useless, depending on how its sequel will approach the story as a whole.",Null,0,0,31 March 2018
The Finest Hours," A Fair Current.
","The title may have been The Finest Hour, however, the film itself didn't quite live up to the meaning.A very wet, grey, cold, weirdly paced and overrun by jargon motion picture, that also suffered from lack of tying up knots, because it was so focused on measuring knots.Was Chief Cluff's call based on knowledge or arrogance? Was his order to send out Bernie, right or wrong? Did he believe in Bernie's abilities, or was he really sending him out to cover his own ass? Sure, there was a point where he voluntarily asked for Bernie's opinion... However, he showed him very little respect otherwise.I don't know if in real life Ray Sybert was offered any recognition for the role he played, but, he was as big a hero as Bernie, and... I would've appreciated the movie highlighting that.From there, Miriam's stringent persona was a delight, and Casey and Chris displayed very decent performances respectively. There were points as well where, even though the movie feels so cold, almost made your heart melt.The cinematography could've been better I imagine, but, ultimately, satisfactory. The directing, was fairly dispatched and the score came to the rescue from time to time. Overall, this movie is a fine 7/10.",7,0,0,25 September 2016
Deepwater Horizon," Greasy Palms Spill Blood and Oil.
","Peter Berg's directing style is incredibly similar to that of Michael Bay's, no matter how much one tries to ignore it, Peter Berg makes it very difficult to brush off. This time round however, instead of always coming second to Bay in almost every way, when comparing Deepwater Horizon to 13 Hours, Deepwter Horizon blows 13 Hours out the water, so to speak... Sadly, Peter needed a budget 3 times higher though, to accomplish that.The build up in the movie and the character interactions, are very reminiscent of films like Armageddon, Transformers and 13 Hours... Peter Berg tried this before with Battleship, and failed dismally. This time though, it came across as a whole lot more natural... And, he has the cast to thank.Unlike Battleship, that was helmed by Taylor Kitsch, Brooklyn Decker and the oh so terrible Rihanna, Deepwater Horizon had Mark, Kurt, Dylan and John; nothing, but a talented cast all around.The rig explosion set piece was, amazingly wonderful. Cinematography was on point, even though there were quite a few mechanisms I didn't understand, that translated into visual jargon.While watching the movie, I wondered to myself; is Vidrine really in the wrong here? When arguing with Mr. Jimmy, he presented arguments that nobody could oppose, and on top of that, even suggested a second test, to prove his theory. But then I remembered, that, from the VERY moment Mr. Jimmy set foot on that rig, he constantly wanted to know the 'cement' situation, because of how vitally important it was, just to find that, Vidrine and Kaluza were behind that suicidal decision to begin with.I appreciated that Deepwater Horizon didn't go on longer than it needed to. The directing was perhaps Peter Berg's best, the cinematography was on point and the cast, top notch. Why Kate Hudson was such a misrepresentation of Felicia Williams however, I guess we'll never know. Anyway, well drilled 7.5/10.",7,0,0,20 May 2017
Gravity," Has Lungs, but the Chest is still a, Cavity.
","When she (Dr. Stone) finally landed in the water, swam her way to the top and grabbed on to that wet sand as if to propose that she just held the world - which a few minutes prior felt worlds away - in her palm, made me realize more graphically, that there was space, between me and the intended emotion. I didn't quite connect with the planned nostalgia... And though I feel Alfonso ultimately did a really good job, I feel he robbed me of his vision, because there was something missing.Also, I love Sandra Bullock, but her performance, though too, very good... Perhaps needed a little more than just being, very good. George Clooney also gets a thumbs up, but I kept wondering if maybe, someone else could've played the role better. Reason being, I didn't expect his death, yet still, when it happened, I didn't feel the loss. Lt Matt was clearly meant to be lovable, so that his unfortunate departure could create that, hole. Sadly (and maybe it's because of the script), though the execution was right, something was missing.However, Steven Price was on point, and the end credits answered a question that kept harassing me; 'How difficult was it, to shoot this film'? Gravity had 1 director, 1 cinematographer... And, an additional cinematographer. That just put a smile on my face, because it's clear when you're watching this movie that, it couldn't have been easy... Yet the end product, was, stellar.Gravity is more than satisfactory, and takes a unique and fresh angle at space related motion pictures, with stunning visuals to boot... However, it falls short of a certain impact, and loses to the abyss of infinite space.",7,1,1,22 October 2016
Alien: Resurrection," It's Ripley's, Believe It Or Not.
","The paraplegic, wasn't his ear supposed to be burnt off, thus causing major medical issues for him? If not burnt off, then at least severely injured, because right after Jean-Pierre went so far as to zoom in on his ear, in Vriess's next shot, his ear was A okay. Oh well, I guess these mistakes happen, it's just that, when they happen in a movie so draining, it's hard to focus on anything else.The Alien series is truly a disappointment. Its been over 250 years, and these aliens are still what they were back in 1979, because this entire series is filled with repetition and gimmicks, with zero story.There was an Alien, that alien came from a queen alien, then an alien lay an embryo inside Ripley and Ripley killed herself. She got cloned and had her DNA mixed with another queen alien, that then gave birth to another alien, and now Ripley has moved from being prey, to being mommy. The 1st sentence is literally all 3 of the first Alien movies, and the second sentence, is a convoluted mess meant to resurrect a kicking horse.I don't know how I would've felt watching these films back in the day, but watching them today, I can't help but see shoddy pieces of work, that get crippled more and more with every sequel, by their predecessors. Heavy hitting names are attached to this series; Scott, Cameron, Fincher and Whedon, which is why I feel so at war with myself, however, I can't ignore what the situation is. 4.4/10.",4,1,2,9 May 2018
Passengers," Accidentally on Purpose.
","Passengers is a highly enjoyable film to watch, however, it feels like it was one thing, that meant to be another, or, it was one thing, made to be another. The angle Passengers took makes me dismiss all its science, not because it may be wrong, like, really wrong, but rather, because science seems almost moot in this particular Science Fiction.Passengers almost feels like a wasted premise... This movie, though again I'll repeat - very enjoyable, needed a more accomplished director at the helm, like the director of The Imitation Game for instance. Yes, I know it's Morten Tyldum too, but this film didn't quite have that edge.The romance conundrum was pretty great, and what would've made it completely marvelous is how Jim would fix it all... Sadly, I'm not sure Jim did fix it. A happy ending for an unforgivable act was imposed, at the cost of intense emotional depth. What Jim did was wrong, and though his situation wasn't his fault, it wasn't Aurora's either, and Aurora being afraid of being alone, doesn't make it right.Sure, had Jim not woken Aurora, everybody would've died... But, at the point of his decision, Jim didn't know this, but, if the argument is fate, then...This film should've never been advertised as a Sci-Fi, but rather, a Romance Drama Adventure, and needed that edge, that depth, that quality acting ability that Jennifer Lawrence can harness.Passengers meant to be a 7+/10, but accidentally became a 6.4/10.",6,1,2,20 August 2017
Zootopia," A Concrete, Not Concrete, But Concrete, Jungle.
","Judy's folks, aren't they the best though? 'It's OK to have dreams, just don't believe in them too much'. The humor in this film has enough sauce and spices. It doesn't feel forced, it doesn't feel over the top. It hits the palate well.Jason Bateman has my kind of humor. It's that type of humor that relies more on delivery, rather than what is actually said. Though actually, everyone involved was pretty good playing their part, I do feel that the show was stolen by Bateman and Elba.The script was terrific, performances - no complaints there, direction and animation was crisp and the story, though somewhat obvious at times, did a pretty exemplary job at being, smart.I can definitely understand why Zootopia is acclaimed, and why it was such a smash hit. I enjoyed it and appreciated its message, even the one that I'm sure, is embedded in its title. a perfectly, imperfect 7.4/10.",7,1,2,7 May 2017
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Crazy Crush, Stupid Sex, Legitimate Love
","Crazy, Stupid, Love gets you laughing, cringing, involved and emotionally engrossed... And while it's busy getting all of that right, it hits you with a twist that's arguably Stupid, but it is so Crazy how the directors hid it in plain sight that, you just have to Love it.Steve Carell I've always felt, is an actor that possesses many of the qualities I rarely ever admire in an actor, however, every time I see him do what he does, I inexplicably respect him that little bit more.The plot is mainly around a couple named the Weavers, and fittingly, the subplots are so nicely woven in, that the final spouts' explosion came together almost like soulmates.The cast is superb. Gosling's opening scene at the mall is so smooth, you can't wait to see what he's going to do for Cal's transformation. Carell is fun to watch throughout, and he doesn't drop the ball. Moore, Emma and Marisa are also a wonderful addition, to a script that does a really sterling job at mixing laughter, sadness, and drama, with a subtle, but nicely expressed sense of humility.This movie was crazy, a little stupid, and about love; and it did it all without being too excessive, and pretty well grounded.",8,0,1,30 October 2016
Point Break," Pointless Break
","For a movie that is about thrills, stunts and exhilaration, it sure did lack in excitement or any type of suspense. Maybe its weak point was, the sheer fearlessness. Utah, Bodhi and Co. had such little fear that, you really couldn't sense any danger... There was damn near literally, zero danger.The closest to suspense this movie got was when they were rock climbing... and that too wasn't all that, exciting. Even the way Grommet just accepted his fate... Was, so ordinary. These guys push fear and show it no respect, then you have Utah reacting when fear pushes back. Utah acts without fear, then gets riddled by guilt when consequences arise.Teresa Palmer, though she is very, very pretty, then sometimes not - she's weird that way - was playing an incredibly flat character. Samsara was quite avoidable in this film, and only seemed like some kind of eye candy. Sure, many movies have that, but here, it felt too obvious.This version is better than its original mainly, if not only based on technical aspects, such as cinematography and composition... Two aspects that have a lot to do with this time vs that time.From there, the progression felt a little incoherent, the acting from Edgar and Luke felt a bit too much, then a bit little... Then a bit too lack luster. The 8 Ordeals approach was meant to make the movie much fresher than the '91 version, but failed dismally... How, I'm not even sure.I'll give Point Break 5/10, only because it didn't inspire anything in me. It was what it was, and that is the end of that. I may be a little harsh, but... I've seen this movie once, and that feels about enough.",5,0,1,20 November 2016
Creed," A Rock Hard Creed.
","This is the best I've seen Michael B. Jordan. He gave this role the type of fight that's necessary to stand your ground and hold your own, inside a ring. He wasn't amazing, but he did a great job, far better than I thought he would... He showed growth, and that is a step in the right direction. He didn't win the fight... But, he won the night.Sylvester Stallone was very natural and comfortable in his role as Rocky... He was rock solid. His performance was mature and convincing... Realistic and artistic at the same time, and though Rocky may have been Donnie's mentor, it also felt as if Sylvester was Michael's mentor too, and you could almost feel it oozing past the fourth wall.Ryan Coogler is young, true, but, he shows promise in this film. The direction and story though at times it would creep along, Creed, still remained strong, on it's legs. It's not a complex screenplay. Friendship, Love, Loyalty, Rite of Passage, and the execution, heartfelt. Tessa Thompson won me over too effortlessly... She was just too gorgeous, and her performance was just as attractive. She owned the camera and was in charge of her character.Jordan, Stallone, Coogler and Thompson were a compelling force, in a journey of discovery and definition, with inspirational elements that hit home... However, I feel this couldn't have been accomplished as well as it was, had it not been for Ludovin. The score is a pool of beautiful rhythmic, melodic and harmonic waves, that you can't help but want to be immersed in.Creed is a story we already know, but, as with any other story of this nature, if it fails at being motivational and just, awe- inspiring, it ultimately loses whatever purpose it was intending to achieve. Creed, did not fail in doing this.7.9/10.",8,0,1,13 November 2016
Troy," Selfish Love
","Though Hector and Achilles are different sides of the same coin, it's Hector who gives the commodity any sense of value.Achilles, you hate loving, and yet still end up disliking him anyway. He had a code, which made him a respectable character, however, he was also very inconsistent and vulnerable to his own emotions - like a little child, to a point where he became a hypocrite, by turning into the very king he abhorred.Hectors patriotism was very understandable, and he stayed true to his code. However, what makes Hector a far better man than Achilles, is that he displayed consistency. Hector fought to defend... Hector fought for peace.Paris and Patroclus were foolish mimics of their mentors. Paris had integrity, without the strength and discipline to endure it. Patroclus had a love for war, without a code or purpose to pursue it.Paris is an embarrassing character with no hope of redemption, Patroclus a sheep, that died in a wolf's clothing. Achilles is an arrogant megalomaniac and Hector... A man of honor, a hero.That concoction of personalities, with some Priam here, Odysseus there and Agamemnon everywhere else, translated into a poetic collision of tragedy and... More tragedy.I would've preferred Achilles live, than fall at the hands of someone as unworthy as Paris.The ladies were gorgeous, and their performances, eye-catching. Wolfgang Petersen made the 3 hours feel like 2, and above all else, inspires a rewatch. The story had you in a firm grasp, and you can't help but love Eric Bana, dislike Brad Pitt and hate Orlando Bloom... and that, is a good thing.8.6/10.",9,0,0,10 September 2016
Spotlight," Spot the Light Difference.
","The subject matter, as well as Ruffalo and Schrieber's performances in particular, together with the rest of the cast is arguably a 10/10, however, a film also comes with more than just actors and plot.Spotlight has an excellent, and a HIGHLY necessary story that needs to be told as much as humanly possible, but, how it was told wasn't at all revolutionary or profound in fact. The story is profound, but the telling of it is not. Spot that light and faint difference.McCarthy's direction was pretty much as ordinary as they come, barring one very piercing scene however, that was just so incredibly subtle, but if noticed, just commanded absolute attention.Also, Shore's score was unreservedly appropriate for this film. It set the necessary tone from the very beginning.Because of its subject matter, Spotlight should get a 10/10, however at the end of the day, it is a piece of art, and should be viewed as such. Its message is amazing, and had it been told better, then this film could've been among the greatest of all time. 7/10.",7,0,0,16 September 2018
Aquaman," Worth a 'Sea', But Did it Land?
","'Where I come from, the water washes away our tears'.The absolute best part about Aquaman, is undoubtedly and unequivocally, Nicole Kidman. She had the best lines, the best story, the best performance and truthfully, she had the best fight sequence (which sadly, is at the beginning of the movie). Nicole Kidman will regrettably be, the unsung hero of this film.The interjections of Vulko and Arthur's growing past was a lovely touch, however, Zack Snyder did a far superior job of that technique, in Man of Steel. James Wan's horror addiction was impossible to ignore, especially given how literally, the very first shot was a type of jump scare, and I appreciated that trademark inclusion. The kiss between Arthur and Mera was also a visual treat.But, that's the thing with Aqauman. It suffers from too many cliches blended together, cliches I do and did enjoy even in this film, except for them being cliches done better before in other films, except perhaps for Arthur and Mera's first kiss.The score was, a bit scattered and uncomposed, while still being satisfying at some parts. It was like Suicide Squad meets Green Lantern. The composition had this tendency of pulling you out of the movie, and throwing you back in, instead of completely immersing you.Aquaman's suit was not great at all, and the Atlantean warriors looked quite silly, while the Atlantean weapon Orm gave Black Manta, looked like it came straight out of Power Rangers. And speaking of Black Manta, I wasn't really excited by him, unfortunately.Jason Momoa is an awesome Aquaman, albeit an unrecognizable one, and Amber Heard's beauty more than qualifies her for the role of Mera, however, her acting prowess felt a little out of its depth. I'm a fan of Patrick Wilson, and he did a satisfactory job, as did Willem Dafoe.Aquaman is a fantastic attempt. It's worth it to see, but, I'm not certain it stuck the landing, much like Arthur's landings in the actual film, or the humor. Except for 2 extremely distinct parts in the film, the humor was Sahara desert dry. 6.7/10.",7,1,2,21 December 2018
Concussion," CcOoNnCcUuSsSsIiOoNn
","The villain is not just a colossal organization, it's not just a gargantuan country... It's human nature.Like football, the world is at loggerheads propelled by selfishness, and like the players, humanity suffer from 'ethical CTE'... And like the NFL, we don't want to admit it, because that means recognition of being bankrupt, morally.This is mainly why, this movie spoke to me and engaged. Greed vs Truth, that lead to Apology vs Bribery. Honestly, after this movie, one has to ask themselves; How is it, that this film performed badly at The Box Office?, and; How true are the findings of the Actuaries, seeing as, like all those doctors before them, who represented The NFL, lied.Peter Landesman was satisfactory on the directors chair, though admittedly, the movie could've come out much more, 'hard hitting'. The pace at times, was sedate, and the editing, jerky... But overall, the film was captivating. The dialogue was filled with so many sublime lines, so many I just couldn't keep up... And every time I heard them, the movie won me over more and more. 'Mike Webster goes mad, and nobody asks why. They make fun of him. They insult him on TV, and they want to pretend that he's disease doesn't exist... And they want to bury me'.Will Smith was amazing, and the reason he may have seemed less amazing is perhaps because, we expect him to be amazing, and so when he is, we're used to it. Also, his Nigerian accent, unlike many Americans before him, was well researched and practiced... It didn't sound like some generic African accent.I'd like to give this movie an 8/10... But, maybe it didn't quite reach that level, so, to stay true to my Review Title, I'll give it a solid 7.7/10.",7,2,5,23 July 2016
Deadpool 2," Dead Man Walking.
","Truthfully, there was heart, action and pretty awesome humor, however, there was no excitement. Deadpool is unique in that, it is or can be too much, but it's a franchise that positioned itself to also be, enough, simultaneously. This is bad, good and weird.Deadpool, as in the character himself, is like that amazing movie with a twist you never saw coming, so, the second watch of said movie will still be amazing, but, knowing the twist already, takes a little something away.The humor has earned its license to overkill, but, it also threatens the survival of all the other characteristics. For instance, the action is there and it's pretty cool, but it's not exciting, and the heart is there, but it's not, pounding.Many of the references were priceless, and the fate of the X-Force during their mission was, altogether, inspired. The story, was actually quite fresh, and many may feel it didn't have a story, because quite possibly, it's a story that would've flourished far better in another film, or tone. Not that it didn't belong in this movie, or that it was wasted on it, rather, it was obscured.Deadpool was an amazing film which is good, however, Deadpool 2 is somehow better which is weird, because it's familiar, which is bad. However, being able to live up to its predecessor is respectable. 8/10.",8,1,4,2 June 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," RagnaRock, Paper, Scissors?
","There are two ways one can take oneself too seriously: 1. The Twilight Saga way or 2. The Dark Knight Trilogy way. What I mean is, Twilight was silly in taking itself seriously, because seriously, it didn't have the maturity required, both because of its directors and cast, to portray the necessary emotion for the desired results of profoundness. The Dark Knight Trilogy on the other hand, is like age old whisky; Swirl, smell, sip and swallow.Thor: Ragnarok could've taken itself seriously in the good way, but rather than doing that, it didn't take itself seriously at all, unnecessarily so, and ended up becoming a good thing still, but in a bad way. It's weird and begs the question(s); Is Marvel bending to its fans' will, or is Marvel forcing its fans to bend to its will? Is Marvel being smart and trying to revolutionize Comic Book Cinema, or stupid, and completely losing the plot?Tension is one of storytelling's best and greatest tools, and Marvel seems to be slowly abandoning it, for another great tool, humour. However, is this Marvel's doing, or is it the fans/critics/audience? Captain America: The Winter Soldier: Serious, dark and amazing = $714 Million Box Office, 89% from critics and 7.8 IMDb. Guardians of the Galaxy: Colourful, silly, funny = $773 Million Box Office, 91% from critics and 8.1 IMDb. GotG beat TWS (even though TWS is a sequel, and sequels tend to do more, and, our first look at Steve after The Avengers) in every way according to numbers, but was GotG actually the better film? Batman Begins, Captain America: The First Avenger, Man of Steel and X-Men: First Class suffered similar fates.I love dark, serious, tense. Ragnarok is not that for the most part, but it's still a good watch. There is a lot that is good about this movie, like Thor and Loki's moment in the elevator, but there is also a lot that is bad too, like the fact that for 4 years we've wondered how Thor would react to Loki's impersonation/imprisonment of Odin, and what we got left much to be desired.I think Ragnarok took a very different approach here, and, because of Marvels appeal and reach, it maybe shaking something loose. Also, they could afford to take this route with Thor, as it is the least received franchise, so, they perhaps didn't have much to lose, and more/everything to gain.Ragnarok being this 'light' also, could work very well for Infinity War, as long as IW is 'hella' dark. The contrast maybe a very welcomed surprise.I will say this though, if Infinity War takes Ragnarok's path, it will undoubtedly, dismantle its opportunity of being a legendary classic, that has been 11 years and 18 movies in the making.Personally I think that at this point, it may be difficult to judge any MCU film by itself, because each installment is now telling the stories of something bigger, so when you factor that in, there maybe more to what meets the eye.Anyway, in the spirit of judging each on its own merit, Thor: Ragnarok; 7/10.",7,90,172,29 October 2017
The Last Song," Right Composition, Wrong Artists, Wrong Lyrics.
","The first thing that needs to be done is; getting rid of Miley Cyrus. I don't necessarily have a problem with her per se, it's just that, the role of Ronnie was way above her expertise. She just didn't do that character any justice whatsoever.Secondly. Change the director and rework the script. Keep, but elevate Liam's performance, and Bobby Coleman (Jonah), either needs to go, or work hard at his overacting.Thirdly. Keep Greg Kinnear. He could've been better, but was terrific and also, keep the deeper story.All these changes, and a few more here and there, The Last Song is prime Oscar material.A story wasted with clichés, overacting, somewhat choppy and unseasoned directing and a lead that just collapsed under what still wasn't, but could've been, dramatic art.The story was on point, it just needed the right nurturing, alas.",5,0,0,5 May 2017
Cloverfield," A Story About a Girl, a Camera and Something.
","The hand held camera format was always going to be an issue, the type where even Reeves, Abrams and Goddard were probably aware of first, long before any other obstacle, so getting it right was an absolute must. Did they get it right? Not completely, but Reeves' directing and the length of the movie went a very long way in cauterizing the bleeding, especially for the viewer's eyes.That camera, that damn camera. The camera is more of a survivor that Tom Hanks in Cast Away, with Destiny's Child playing in the background and Jeff Probst narrating the whole thing.There were some issues I had with the acting, however there were other parts where all the main actors involved redeemed themselves to satisfactory levels. There was also one scene, the tunnel scene, which felt a bit out of touch with reality, given how Cloverfield did such a stellar job at creating a natural and authentic panic.Cloverfield is actually not about the creature, it's about the consequence of it. This film is a prelude, it's an entire movie about depicting an aftermath. It's the movie before the origin story, but not a prequel, and I believe that was a pretty brilliant stance and angle to take.Another awesome touch, is introducing the main couple and telling their story as a recording being recorded over by the current event. A creative way in recounting a flashback.Also, the way Cloverfield ends is, somehow perfect, because though it doesn't provide any kind of closure what-so-ever, it does however, fit extremely well within its approach. If the approach had been executed terribly, then that ending would've been aweful.Cloverfield is an awesome watch. 7.3/10.",7,0,0,30 March 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Homecoming Prince.
","Did you notice that, just like a vulture, Keaton's Adrian Toomes scoured the streets of New York, picking at dead metal, in an attempt to salvage what was left, in order to feed his family?Did you notice that Tony Stark's scolding to Peter on the roof was inspired by Tony's actual characteristic, that we were given a glimpse into, during Iron Man Three?Did you notice how Watts used the whole 'diversity push' to his advantage? Instead of using one race to just traditionally replace another, he used it to strengthen his work.Did you notice, that with this particular Spider-Man, because of his age, he wasn't a hero, he was a trouble maker who had the makings of a hero... because of his age, he doesn't yet have the maturity or acumen to become a hero through similar trials and errors of hero's such as Strange or Ant-Man?At the age of 15, most boys have absolutely no idea how to even react or act around a girl... So imagine at that age, you get thrust into a world even Tony Stark wasn't ready for; How would you handle it? How would you react?The angle Jon Watts took here, put together with trying his level best to separate this Spidey to his predecessors, makes this rendition pretty damn ingenious.It's young, it's clumsy, but also smart and consistent. Spider-Man: Homecoming is setting us up for the journey of a lifetime, from when Peter was young and stupid, to what and who he'll be in Spider- Man: Homecoming 2 and 3... Stronger, smarter... Wiser.My biggest gripe with Homecoming is the suit; it felt a bit too Iron Man like, and because we can't see how Peter will make it completely and totally his own just yet, it was hard to ignore.From there, given the hurdles this film had to endure, and how Watts' take was truly so fresh, makes this film a Homecoming King. 7.8/10.",8,1,4,21 August 2017
Alien," Good, Though Perhaps Alien, to the 21st Century.
","I can definitely understand the rating Alien has, however, watching it now, the problem isn't the special effects (they're fine and clearly amazing for their time), rather, the problem is how drawn out the story feels.It takes around 40 minutes for Alien to start. Before that is a long winded journey of suspense and discovery, then after it finally really starts, there's more of the same at too many parts. For instance, a longer time than necessary is spent looking for the cat (Jones), right before Brett is killed, and that time itself was directly preceded by another sequence filled with too much shadowing.The pacing wouldn't be such an issue, if at least the suspense was able to live up to it. The coolest part by far is when the parent alien was attached to Kane. It was ominous and appropriately nightmarish. Thereafter, especially given Dallas's constant nonchalance, the film feels, lengthy.Also, we never really get to fully see the alien in its entirety, and maybe that was by design, but because of the pacing, I found myself needing something in the film to look forward to, and since the story was already a far gone conclusion, it left the spotlight on the alien.This may seem like a negative review, however, I did enjoy this film, though it lost my full attention at some points due to its near inactivity, or seemingly sedate flow. I'd love to give it more, however my experience of it just can't allow it. 6/10.",6,2,4,6 May 2018
Black Mass," Boss Cast, By the Ton.
","Joel Edgerton as usual stepped in front of the camera, and did damage. He is an impressive actor, and is always wonderful to watch. Cumberbatch is always looking to stretch himself somehow, challenge himself as a true artist, and again, thumbs up. An Englishman who pulled off an Irish American accent pretty well, from what I could hear.Johnny Depp was absolutely amazing to watch. I'm not really drawn to any of his movies, or the type of roles he plays, so seeing him in something this different, and executing it so well, was a joy to witness.The rest of the cast, especially Jesse Plemons, were also pretty good. However, as good of a performances as every one of the actors achieved, Black Mass feels like a squandered classic. It lacked a certain extra, or necessary thrill, and much of the movie feels a bit too, forgettable.Black Mass is by no means a bad movie at all, it just, wasn't as good as it was perhaps meant to be. What carried it however, is something that should be a major contributor in any film, and that is the cast. The cast was just, noteworthy.I would seriously love to give Black Mass a 7/10, but, honestly, it falls a little short because, things are missing in it, and ultimately the film feels like something we've really seen many times before. So, 6.7/10, that I'll reluctantly round up to 7/10.",7,0,0,7 May 2017
The Town," A Stolen Heart, in The Heart of Robbery.
","I absolutely dig it, when the leading lady turns rogue, especially when the antihero makes the audience switch with her.I'm no expert on how an Irish American ought to sound, but, even though Affleck was charming and cool in his role as Doug, the accent felt very iffy. Renner was much better, and his performance was quite enjoyable to watch.The story was straight forward, and Affleck did a great job at keeping the viewers interest at the necessary level to luxuriate in 150 minutes of blossoming love, painful pasts, tough realities, betrayal and of course, loss.Rebecca Hall and Blake Lively. Beauty, talent, admirable, like- ability and attractiveness all rolled up in... two. It must be Rebecca's British allure and Blake's breathtaking smile, but these ladies get the job done every time it would seem.The Town is a simple story, that was told very well and portrayed quite eloquently by a capable cast. 7.2/10.",7,0,0,16 April 2017
Suicide Squad," Its Like, Committing Suicide by Making Love. Blame Warner Bros., not DC.
","Finally got to watch the much anticipated Suicide Squad, and... I'd like to start with; DC and David Ayer, are not the reasons I believe, as to why this movie is WITHOUT EQUIVOCATION, one of the most incoherent motion pictures I have EVER seen in my life. Suicide Squad is incredibly enjoyable, however, it has more plot holes than a Gang/Mob of Meerkats, and that run deeper than The Mariana Trench.The Suicide Squad we've seen, is actually 2 versions of the same movie, in 1. And therein, lies the problem. Thus, TRUTHFULLY, anyone who believes this movie is an 8+/10, is either lying to themselves, or, they just don't care either way.Firstly, the good. The show was not stolen by who I thought it would be stolen by, which is Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn - she was awesome to watch, and had a depth which once explored in later films, will probably make her the most interesting of the bunch, however in this film, truth be told, Viola Davis, Will Smith and Cara Delevingne's Enchantress, were the hero's that inflated the enjoyment. Davis's badassery was, 'gangster'. Will Smith's humour was, genuine. And Cara's Enchantress, was... well, enchanting.The Joker, I was afraid would be overacted by Leto, but... I think, he was as good as Affleck's Batman in comparison to Bales, as his Joker is comparable to that of Ledgers. Leto was good, but Ledger is still better.Speaking of Affleck, his Batman/Wayne cameo was, really fun to see.The visuals, though the cinematography could've been better, were an absolute joy.The score. One word. Amazing!!!Now for why critics give Suicide Squad 26%. This movie is like a well constructed main national road, that has 'potholes' left, right and centre. The plot holes are so bad in fact, that the movie would keep contradicting itself in the exact same moment... I don't think I've ever seen a movie, at least one of this calibre, do that. For example; While Amanda Waller was describing just how crazier than The Joker, Harley is, The Joker proves to in fact, be crazier than Harley. Another one (among MANY others, that you just can't let it go anymore); Right after we're shown how easy it is to kill The Enchantress's army, Amanda, explains how difficult, to almost impossible it is, to kill them. Now, these can be taken as 'nit picking', but sadly - because of the many times this same mistake happens, it's really not nit picking... But let's say it is; how about the movies motivation though? It's a plot hole so bad, it makes little, to no sense.The Squad, had an opportunity to kill the ONLY 2 people who had power over them, however, the movie just completely ignored that fact... A fact that would've ended this movie, in 1 hour. But fine, let's still say, they inexplicably, had a change of heart.How do they explain, The Enchantress not killing Amanda Waller in her hotel room??? I'll tell you how, they don't.How do they explain The Enchantress not killing everybody, in the boardroom at ARGUS? They don't.Why didn't AT ANY TIME, with one fell swoop, The Enchantress not take her heart back???The Enchantress's brother (Incubus) was a killing machine... Then suddenly, against the Squad, he turned into an amateur blind archer... He's precision moved from 100, to 0... Why? Because...Suicide Squad, made the exact same mistake Green Lantern made back in 2011 (AMONG MANY OTHERS); They had a villain way to powerful, as an initial adversary, to overcome.This films greatest flaw is, if you were to explain it's motivation logically... The movie wouldn't exist.Is 26% harsh? Perhaps. Is it better than BvsS... Arguably not, but I do believe it is certainly, without question, more enjoyable.I don't know how to rate this movie, because Making Love is 100% fun, however Suicide... that, that can mess up your whole day.Easily could've been an 8... Hell, even a 9... But then... That 9, from some point in the movie, slowly started rotating. I would truly love to give this movie a 7... I would love to... But, David Ayer/WB make it IMPOSSIBLE to justify. Hell, I'm only even hovering around 6, because I refuse to believe that, this movie could possibly be a 5, and below.So, from 9... To 6.something/10.",6,0,1,6 August 2016
Doctor Strange," From Mr. To Dr. To Master.
","The pace in this film is so strange, in that it is without question, the most blistering of all the MCU installments, seriously, without equivocation! Yet somehow, even with that, there was a good 10 minutes in the film that loses you quite a bit, and not because it's bad, but I feel it's a symptom caused by how fast this film moves, that when it just slows down to a standard pace, you feel a type of jet lag, yet still on top of that, you feel that Doctor Strange could've easily, been longer than just 1 hour 55 minutes.The humour. Marvel needs to tone down on the humour. There were areas, and enough in fact, where the humour struck the right chords, but, like Age of Ultron, Doctor Strange suffers from a strangle hold of jokes and unnecessary humour. There were parts, and noticeably so, where humour needed to be thrown to the wayside, especially because of the type of actor Cumberbatch is. Strange may be a Master of The Mystic Arts, but Cumberbatch is a Master of, Dramatic Arts... So again, I wish Marvel would've given him more room to be that.The love story between Strange and Palmer was, too secondary, instead of it faintly manufacturing itself, in the background. Musically, it would be a breakdown, instead of being that, bass- line, which gives a song that oomph. I didn't get the chance to really love Palmer in that way (again, a pace issue), McAdams can make you fall in love with her characters, however, McAdams, as always, was an extreme pleasure to watch.Alright, now for the strangely amazing. The opening sequence of this film was 'WTF' amazing. It sets your expectations unusually high, another reason why for a brief period, the movie loses you as it tones down, but, it brings you right back up again, and this time... It doesn't let go. The magic, the fight sequences and the visuals representing them were absolutely spectacular.I also applaud Marvel as to how they approached a villain in this installment. Kaecilius didn't want to kill, rule or destroy. He wanted to neutralize his painful past, for himself and all, with what he thought was a gleeful future, through the main villain - Dormammu, who was just too strong for Strange to beat, so instead of winning or defeating, Strange rather did some neutralizing of his own, by outsmarting and, bargaining. The concept of Good and Evil pretty much remains the same in film, and it's no different in this particular one, however, the attempt of freshening it, was unalike.The final fight scene was, exceptionally sublime, brilliant and worthy of noting as a testament, to Scott Derrickson's successful attempt at showing us something we haven't seen before. Forget reverse motion and freezing of time, what Scott did was depict time being bent on itself by portraying it in a way I've never seen; the present playing itself out during an occurring past. The idea deserves a: 'Thank you'.The story wasted very little time, and tended to be a bit too direct, but it came together very well. Motives were explained, and the reactions from the characters concerned, were understandable. Cumberbatch was class and the cast was quality. Scott played around with horror elements, and I'm happy he did. Ben Davis, once again displayed expertise in his craft. The visuals in Doctor Strange could've easily seemed heavily disarranged, but they came out magnificently. The score sounded a lot like Star Trek: Into Darkness, so perhaps Giacchino could've done a bit more, but overall, he was very good.Out of 10, like a constantly changing reality, I give it a 7.6 that keeps spinning into a .9, then .6, then .9... So, 7.7/10 it is, that I'll round off to a spinning 8... Because an 8 right way up or upside down is still an 8, and horizontally, it's infinity... Ideas and concepts this film captured very well. Strange was strange indeed.",8,2,4,5 November 2016
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The War is Lost: Episode II
","No. No, no, no... No, no!!! This movie, is junk. It's horrible. Disgustingly so. It was one of the longest 2 hours of my life... I was digging my nails through my skin.This movie felt like detention, and I was feeling every never ending second pass by, as this most incredible sorry excuse for a film, clawed away at my soul.No... No... No, no, no... No!!! No! How can a franchise, be THIS AWFUL, and yet be so successful??? HOW???And an Oscar Nomination, for visual effects? How, though? Why? When? By who??? This movie does not deserve a single award for anything, let alone a nomination. NO!",2,2,9,22 December 2015
Forrest Gump," The ForrestShank ReGumption.
","I'll start like this; Do you want to know how it's possible to in fact consider The Shawshank Redemption as an eternal classic? Well, because The Shawshank Redemption is without question, a superior film to Forrest Gump, and the funny thing is, Forrest Gump is truly an amazing film. That's how you can tell how amazing The Shawshank Redemption was, because it is better than another amazing, super amazing film.Forrest Gump was released over 20 years ago, and this is the first time I finally got to watch, finally got to see the film who's shadow The Shawshank Redemption lived under, and what an entertaining and stunning watch it was, however, I just can't get over how this film took away all the spotlight from well, TSR.I guess I'm reviewing both movies in one here, because they are two films which are so worthy, while one, though received multiple Oscar Nominations, was unjustly ignored, and I'm just not able to do so while watching Forrest Gump, but in the same breath, I sincerely don't blame Forrest Gump either, because like I've been saying, it is a fantastic film.Forrest Gump is what happens when you just don't overthink anything, while still maintaining a pure heart. The man just, did. No words, all actions. No analyzing, just commitment. Sure perhaps, there may have been some luck, however, because of how Forrest went about his life, luck was neither here nor there, and on top of that, though he may have been lucky, he also did experience immense and intense heartbreak, and that, perhaps makes all the difference.Sivestri and Zemeckis were in the zone, and that is the best way I can put it. The visual effects, especially for that time were superb. The action bits, in such a drama driven movie were so well positioned and the way this film was tying into the past and the future was appropriately humorous.The relationship between him and Jenny is such a beautiful tragedy. A happily ever after between the two of them would've just ruined this film, and that sucks, because damn it, Gump deserved better than her, but we also wanted him to be with her because well; 'Forrest, I'll always be your girl'. Also, the way Zemeckis told the story, allowed for Jenny's childhood story to come through for her, and explain to us that, Jenny was lost, broken and stuck, held prisoner by her past. Without having to be graphic about it, or delve way to deep into it, we knew that Jenny's heart was bleeding, long before she knew it was, and so knowing that, though Forrest may have deserved better, she deserved him. That is so weird and beautiful and just absolutely tragic.The Shawshank Redemption is better, however, Forrest Gump is not worse. 8.4/10.",8,1,1,25 February 2018
Southpaw," The Ring That Mattered, Was Hers.
","Have we seen this story a million times before? Yes, sure, we have. Southpaw however says; 'So What'!!!This movie had emotional engagement, which is why when Billy lost the woman wearing his ring, we as the viewers felt the loss too. Rachel McAdams is so stunning in front of the camera, that we really did just need the first quarter, to fall in love with her character.Jake Gyllenhaal was superb. Billy was a wreck and Jake sold it. You really do feel the inevitability of everything falling apart around him, and once it does, though very predictable, you're still so heavily invested in Billy and Leila that you're still asking yourself; 'Billy, why didn't you listen to her in the first place'.The pace and structure of the film however, like the Japanese Gyro- Top, though still rapidly spinning, would tend to seem like it's about to topple over. However, Antoine maintained an emotional connection with the viewer, to a point where, even you as the viewer, would choose to hold on to the feeling, thus the top, kept spinning, with Antoine and Jake continuing the necessary momentum.The Jab-Cross-Left Uppercut-Cross combination of Antoine Fuqua, Jake Gyllenhaal, Rachel McAdams and James Horner, like Billy's final move on Escobar, is a knock-out, and though you may recover from it... The points still tip against you.So yeah, 8/10 for this one. Very enjoyable and oh so, poignant.In Memory of James Horner.",8,0,0,16 October 2016
Nightcrawler," Law Breaking, Breaking News.
","A sociopath like individual, who - though his behaviour is incredibly abnormal, has a certain code of conduct and a constant and unbiased logic that really provides him with strong credibility throughout the film, so much so that one has to keep reminding themselves not to like him, because he is the bad guy. Though Lou's logic really is quite admirable, it is not user-friendly and his execution of said logic is wrong, dishonest and criminal.Without taking the whole dissociative disorder route, Nightcrawler was able to somehow create a lead character who is both the protagonist and antagonist, who also was able to make you feel uncomfortable most times he was on screen, because of his unpredictable, though logical, but illicit nature.Nina, portrayed by Rene Russo, assists greatly in highlighting the protagonist in Lou, making her another aspect the viewer has to keep in mind, when straying away from disliking Lou, because he is an antagonist at his core, but still, somehow one keeps finding themselves hating to love him. I mean what he does to Joe is vicious, immoral and evil, yet still, you don't quite find yourself completely against him... Or maybe that's also because of how impressively well Jake Gyllenhaal knocks this character out the park.Ultimately though, what Lou ends up doing to Rick, even though Lou was doing what Lou does, which is calculating, weighing and using logic, finally gets one completely against him, like how it should be, given his depraved execution.Dan Gilroy and Jake Gyllenhaal deserve a round of applause with this one. The writing, direction and performance was exciting and gripping. Rene Russo was graceful and the supporting cast was compulsory. A title reminiscent of an incessant bug delivered by a performance which captures said image almost flawlessly, I give Nightcrawler a solid 9.2/10.",9,1,1,12 November 2016
Baby Driver," No Plan. Just Drive, for Miles and Miles.
","Why didn't Baby agree with Doc to rather not go through with the job after Bats' mess up? Why was his plan to say yes, then run in the middle of the night? Saying 'no' seems to me like it would've been the shortest route between him getting out of there, and getting to Debora for their 2 a.m. road trip.Speaking of Debora, I'm not really all that crazy about Lily James, but my was she just delicious in this movie. Also, I could feel the calm Debora was for Baby. Ansel and Lily had great chemistry, and made a wonderful onscreen couple.The dialogue, script and word play was especially entertaining, and the performances were effortless all around, and well executed. I would've liked to see a little more of Jon Bernthal however. The action sequences syncing with the score was also a nice touch.Baby Driver is enjoyable, and Edgar Wright is a virtuoso, but at points, it seemed to lose a little bit of control; like Bats insisting on going to the diner, just to want to shoot Debora afterwards. That situation was contrived to have the team meet Debora, however contained little sense in that; why after the night they'd had, would Bats want to further risk the operation?I would absolutely love to give this film a 7/10, but, it left me wanting. I feel like Edgar did in fact write and direct something pretty awesome, but, it lacked. Baby being a driver and his name being 'Miles' were those nice elements, but, I couldn't help feeling not as satisfied as I wanted to. 6.5/10.",6,1,2,15 April 2018
Justice League," Minor League.
","There is always so much to say when it comes to the DCEU. You want to be honest, but also exhibit to the die-hard fans that you're not the villain, especially because, many of us, would love to also see the DC franchise soar.There is always risk. Infinity War for instance, runs the major risk of being a complete failure, because it has generated anticipation that spans an entire 10 years, a whole decade; so the delivery needs to meet expectations that have been multiplying and amplifying, and that will prove without question, to be one hell of a mountain to climb.With Justice League, well, it ran the undeniable risk of being compared to Marvel's 2012 Avengers Assemble, and possibly not being up to the task. Justice League ran the risk of not being the first to 'do it', and so, if they can't be the first, they can damn sure perhaps, be the best.There is a rivalry here, hopefully healthy. Hate it or love it, the best way to really judge Justice League, is to compare it directly to Avengers Assemble, and sadly, it is a distant 2nd.For example; because of BvS: Dawn of Justice, Batman, Wonder Woman and Superman all had already met, so, the excitement of them meeting for the very first time, and also in the very first actual DC team- up extravaganza, that goosebumps inducing moment was dead in the water long before Aquaman could breathe life into its lungs.Furthermore, Loki, even without comparison, was an amazing villain to watch, and Tom Hiddleston brought him to life excellently. Steppenwolf, was just okay. The CGI on Cyborg was, suspect and the CGI on the Parademons was brutal. Flash's armour wasn't the best either, but, with that one, we understand why. The first act of the movie was Cyborg, Flash and Aquaman's backstory and motive, which was way too much story to fit in, thus it felt a bit incomplete and without that juice, to mention a few.Watching Justice League, and seeing with my own two eyes that for the first time ever, this union is in fact happening was amazing, but, the film itself, could've been so much more.Gal Gadot was gorgeous as usual, Flash was on and off, Affleck was, Affleck, and Cavill's Superman was truly awesome actually, but the ones who stole the show were Jeremy Irons and Jason Momoa. They probably fall within the characters who received the least screen time, but, like those '3 minutes', Jason especially, made it count.The League vs Superman fight was stunning, and what Superman said to Batman was just so truly, piercing... I absolutely loved it. That entire sequence/scene is hands down, the best in the movie. The energy it had, was enough to have been the one to bring Superman back to life... And honestly, it did.Justice League isn't bad, entirely, but, it's definitely not in The Major Leagues. I'll say it again, DC has such incredible characters, but Warner Bros. aren't doing them, True Justice. 6.2/10.",6,5,7,18 November 2017
Man of Steel," Man of Steel: Done Justice. MOS SUPERior to BvsS
","Man of Steel, is better than Batman vs Superman in almost every way.Superman: In MOS: The character is a bit bland and colourless. In BvS: Pretty much the same, perhaps, slightly better.Lois Lane: In MOS: She is compulsory. Has presence and purpose. We love her. In BvS: Out of place and utterly useless.General Zod vs Doomsday and Lex Luther: Zod: Firstly, the fact that Zod as a villain alone, is able to take on both villains in comparison, says it all. Michael Shannon was stunning. General Zod had a reason for his intentions. Not all is perfect with the character, but when put up against DD and LL, it's like comparing Heath's Joker, to... whatever villain that's been useless in the past. DD & LL: These villains are pointless and without an agenda, or a valid one I guess. Lex was made to seem like; He just wants to see the world burn, with a 'Kid in a candy shop' twist. All that twist did, was wring the plot dry. And Doomsday... An abrupt and unnecessary villain.Story: MOS: David S. Goyer and CHRISTOPHER NOLAN. CHRISTOPHER NOLAN!!! BvS: There is no Christopher Nolan. Enough said.Score: In both MOS and BvS, Hans Zimmer brought quality, but in MOS, you feel more emotion, that strikes a deeper sensation.Action: MOS: Amir Mokri was on form. Cinematography was on point. The fight in Kansas... Awesome. Catching Superman in mid-flight, and slamming him into the tar. The acceleration and real-time combo of the camera, absolute joy. BvS: Batman and Superman's battle royale... What a mess. A let down. What is the opposite effect of goosebumps? Because, that's what it was. It was... ordinary.Final Battle: MOS: A flight fight that could take on Neo vs Agent Smith. Pure entertainment. BvS: Why was Wonder Woman there??? Why was Doomsday there???Before I run out of words; Man of Steel's 56% is crazy unfair, just like BvsS's 29%. They both definitely deserve more, however... I'll repeat, Man of Steel, did a solid job. BvsS... Rushed... Because DC is dancing to Marvel's tune... Unnecessarily so.",8,1,1,1 April 2016
The Revenant," Tummy Tuck on Steroids
","First things first... That bear attack, how did they shoot it? I mean, was that bear real? Is Leo aware that; 'Hey, I'm just shooting a movie, here, right'... Because, that scene, gives meaning to this films title. It was a graphic, not gory, yet a realistic depiction of a bear attack. Well done Alejandro and Emmanuel.Next, lets - for a moment, imagine that the bear attack didn't live up to expectations, of erecting a revenant; that gutting of a horse, for him to lay dormant inside it, just to survive, surely would've been worth a look, as a substitute title, The Abdominoplasty, aka, The Tummy Tuck.The Revenant, was, stunning, however, it's pace was... frequently, slow-moving, and it lost you a little. Also, the mixture of the languages and civilizations was, a bit confusing at times. On top of that, the death of Glass's son, didn't move me, and it felt a bit contrived and orchestrated... Which means, I couldn't fully appreciate Glass's thirst for revenge, and the motivation it gave him, to rise again.And, was this Leonardo's best performance? For me, not at all. Was it an Oscar performance... Yes. Was it worth the win... I don't know. And Tom, there were points where he'd sound like Bane, and look like his character Eames, from Inception - thanks to his mannerisms, but, I do love that he decided to take on a role that's this different from his previous works.For me, this film is not quite an 8/10... The most spectacular scene - being the bear attack, happens 28 minutes into the film... Then thereafter, we have 2 more hours, that need to be given reason... In some parts, they succeed, but in others, Alejandro lost me, left me for dead, haha, for a while. Also, the most purposeful scene, didn't captivate me, so... 7.7/10 it is.",7,1,2,25 July 2016
Warrior," Strong Swing and a Miss
","Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton and Frank Grillo. These are 3 actors, I love. The latter 2 being way underrated I think, but they are amazing. Their intensity in front of the camera, is 'Pound for Pound for Pound'. However, though this film, at many points; got me cheering, involved and engaged, it also got me to that point right before being close to tears, and then, it dropped me.As the film progressed, I found myself backing Brendan Conlon, but not fully, because Tommy also had his own baggage eating away at him. Sadly though, Tommy, Brendan and their father Paddy's back stories weren't quite fleshed out enough for us to understand their inability to forgive.Sure, Paddy beat on their mother, and Brendan chose to stay with Paddy, because he fell in love with Tess, thus Tommy is angry at Paddy and Brendan... I get the tragedy of that, but, the anger Tommy felt, seemed more deep seeded. OK, maybe that's because of Iraq. But still, his story is not told well enough, for you to empathize, it's only told well enough for you to sympathize, to a point. Reason being, because of Brendan's maturity and struggle, Tommy starts to seem like a baby, without a cause, and because of that... The story, kept dropping and catching, and dropping me.Honestly, you only feel for Tommy because of Hardy's impressive portrayal, not because of Tommy's actual story. I mean, he even turns his back to his niece's, while his hurting brother, pleaded with him.Warrior gave hints at back stories, and perhaps told them at points, but, it didn't bring them to life, and for that, it loses me, because I don't think Warrior was a Sport Movie... I think it was meant to be a Drama with a sport backdrop.It's a... Hit, with the fans, I see that... But, I can't give it an 8. It was a potential 8, that for me, turned into a very well fought for, 6.I realized all the points of absolution. Brendan with Paddy. Tommy with Paddy. And at the end, Tommy with Brendan... But still, those points came about based on the necessity of a happy ending... They didn't arise from tackling what it was that was tearing them apart.",6,2,4,31 July 2016

","I'll start off like this; a lot of Oscar Nominations came this movies way, and even won one... I'm not exactly sure how, or why.Personally for me, Bradley Cooper was just wrong for this role. There is a certain smoothness and charm that Cooper has, and cannot shake, thus, being this uncontrollable, bipolar and erratic loon just looked really silly, and again for me, exposed his limits.Jennifer Lawrence was far better perhaps, but, this was not an Oscar Nomination performance, let alone a win. She was just the female version of Cooper... Pat and Tiffany were the same character in different genders, which makes character depth quite questionable.Honestly, Lawrence was far better in The Hunger Games, than this movie, which again in my view, just reveals how the Oscars are prejudice against big budget blockbusters, just because they're big budget blockbusters.De Niro, Weaver and Tucker were also very good, and a major part as to why I've rounded off the rating to a 6/10.The story, direction and score, are not the best I've seen or heard. Things happen in this movie where you're like; 'What, how?'. There are also things that aren't quite resolved, or resolved properly at least.I enjoyed this movie, as much as it allowed me to I guess, but, it does not at all deserve a single Oscar Nomination, just like how Pat and Tiffany didn't deserve the score they received at the dance competition.I love the cast... The cast, is the best thing about this movie. Apart from that, it's choppy, nonsensical, a bit boring at points, but the acting ultimately, carried it quite well.5/10 feels harsh, but somehow still appropriate... so, 5.5/10 from me.",6,1,3,26 March 2017
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Mission Impossible: Repeat Nation
","Throughout the entire 131 minutes, I wasn't wowed once. Rogue Nation, didn't inspire a single reaction out of me. I was neither bored, nor impressed... I was just, watching. It's not a bad movie, but, it's also not one to remember.Ghost Protocol is better, in perhaps, every way. And also, I'd like to know where Agent Carter is... because I think she was pretty amazing in MIGP.Another thing is, just after being disavowed in Ghost Protocol, MIF found itself again, having to not exist, while not existing, in it's very next installment... And Mission Impossible has been working on that premise pretty much throughout the series, so much that, I figure, for some reason, MIF will have to be dissolved again in Mission Impossible 6... Because I don't know - maybe, Ethan will be framed for; assassinating President Kennedy all those decades ago.In my opinion, Ghost Protocol remains the crowned head of the Mission Impossible series.",6,3,4,23 July 2016
Aliens," Alien, Just With the 'S', But Without the 'Cott'.
","Okay, so in the 80's, a character like Ripley could earn one an Oscar Nomination, but today, a character like The Matrix's Trinity and especially Katniss Everdeen, will never even bring you close to a Nomination, when Sigourney's performance was satisfactory to be fair, playing a type of character very similar to the above mentioned and not even as well? This of course isn't Aliens' fault, but I feel it adds to the acclaim that it garnered.I have no problem with Aliens, except for the fact that, to be honest, it was an almost frame by frame replica of Alien, except a larger everything, from cast to explosions, to a greater population of well, the very same aliens, with them attacking the same way, being beaten the same way and the suspense being executed, the exact same way.Also, because of the carbon copy, the series quite literally couldn't progress. The only thing further we now know is that, there is a 'queen alien'. But, where do they come from? Why and how are they on LV426? What inhabited the planet before their arrival? What are these aliens? What's their agenda? What happened to their planet/home? All these questions, with an entire 2 hrs 30 minutes addressing non of them and rehashing what Ridley had already covered.The effects are excellent, and yes, Cameron is an accomplished, world renowned director, and respected in all corners of the world, however, Cameron in this case just copy pasted Scott's work, with a bigger budget. The film itself is done well, but the vision is redone, well.I really, and truly want to love this film and series, but in this particular installment, it's incredibly difficult to ignore Cameron's major shortcoming. From there, this movie also had it's own problems, as well as its own successes, and ultimately, it was a film well made, albeit it, a film remade. 6/10.",6,2,5,7 May 2018
Captain America: Civil War," Mission Report: April 27th, 2016
","This movie is not perfect... But, it is intelligent. It's a story, and, it is in fact such a Civil War, that the act of war itself, is the main villain. The Russo's realized something very pertinent from the word go; This movie ran the risk of being too loud, cluttered, without direction, CGI driven and pointless... In other words, the Russo's realized that, if one sticks to the script without a second thought, sticks to what is expected, Civil War would be the absolute mess that was Batman v Superman.My only complaint about this movie, quite honestly, exists from the Russo's careful, and marvelous construction. The story, including the screenplay, was epic. The character introductions... Spider- Man's was Amazing, haha... And Black Panthers'... was so well motivated, then logically deescalated.My complaint within the Russo's excellent vision, was that, they took away a few things - 3 in particular, that for me, make a HUGE difference. Firstly, the Score, was boring... It diminished the excitement terribly... It was too, non-existent and short lived. And also, the Airport scene... It was very good, but, it was not at all as mind blowing and legendary as it was supposed to be... Almost like the final fight scene in Iron Man Three, damn it, it left me wanting. The editing as well... The scene of Black Widow catching the vial in Lagos was cut so badly (amongst a few others), I felt myself deliberately trying to shrink my irritation, because that fight scene was so awesome, that editing that scene correctly, would've been the sweet cherry on top. These are my only problems.From there, Zemo (Daniel Bruhl, I've got nothing but love) was a thrilling undertone villain, in the back- round, logically and with good motive, wonderfully orchestrating a collapse of an empire - while the empire is understandably distracted, like Ultron would say: 'From the inside'... And at the end, you ask yourself; 'Did he lose, really'. Unlike BvS, with Sups 'death', you know he is coming back, so, tension is lost... But, with Civil War, even with knowing The Avengers are coming back, you sense that, they aren't coming back the same... You sense that, a part of The Avengers, are in fact, dead.Bucky, Vision, Scarlet, Hawkeye, War Machine, Ant/Giant Man... My goodness, there is so much to say and love about this movie, and how the Russo's tied it together that... I mean, I'd have to type a review that would take the full 147 minutes to read.An the unsung hero in this movie; Sam Wilson/Falcon. Anthony Mackie... He was just, stunning. I loved him... He killed it!!!This thrilling ride could've been a 9.9/10... However, it doesn't deserve a 7... So, I'll give it an 8/10... A lot of thought went into the story, and I love that.",8,1,4,24 May 2016
Avengers: Endgame," Avengers: Endgame 3000.
","What Endgame needed to be, was a movie that illustrated the love its makers had for not only the the movie itself, but far more importantly, for an entire decades' worth of journey. For the MCU to thrive for over a decade, was us, its fans, showing our commitment to this creation; what Avengers: Endgame needed to be, was the MCU's creator's turn, to demonstrate their commitment to us. What Avengers: Endgame needed to be, was a Love Letter 3000, to a fan base that followed it to the end of Time and Space, with our Minds and Souls, that allowed it the Power to touch our Reality.That, truthfully, is a gargantuan task, so huge in fact, that if this film was a complete disaster, you would almost understand the inevitability of such an outcome. So with that said, did Feige, The Russo Brothers, and the MCU give us a Love Letter 3000?The topic of time travel has always been a tall order, especially if your intention is to respect the science, while delivering an entertaining product. Endgame, did exactly that; though not perfectly, it did it with some level of perfection.Trying to fit in story, reunions, suffering, action and sadly, goodbyes, was again always going to be a tough ask. Endgame at points felt rushed, but not because they were rushed scenes, but rather because, as a fan, personally, I wanted to linger that little bit longer in the moment, and I imagine most fans felt the same. However, rushed or not, the nods, connections and continuity that was displayed in this film, to accomplish everything from story to goodbyes, was handled with such care that, you can linger in that intention of attention.So, with amazing attention to detail, a difficult story that was dealt with, professionally and passionately though not perfectly, a cast that can never really ever be forgotten, in a film that quite honestly, didn't feel like a film, but more like genuine adieu with a heavy heart, Avengers: Endgame leaves you asking for nothing more, except maybe: 'Do you really have to end?'Thank you Marvel Studios, for your Love Letter 3000.",9,0,5,1 May 2019
Alien vs. Predator," AVP, Not MVP.
","Well, if Bishop died, it would mean that Alien vs. Predator is not a 'prequel' to the Alien quartet, since he appeared in Alien 3. However, the end of Alien Resurrection clearly shows that earth is no more, which would mean that AVP, would then have to be a prequel.One of the many questionable plot lines, that I guess could be answered by altering previous truths and intentions. Apart from that, AVP proves to be somehow the freshest of the sequels (It's sad that W.S. Anderson may have given a better product that James Cameron), though perhaps not the best, while of course, it still suffers from the same basic issues this entire franchise is plagued with.AVP substitutes a spaceship, a colony, a jail and another spaceship, for an underground pyramid, then follows the exact same overdone Alien franchise blueprint that excels mainly in under delivering.The Predator's origins on earth involving the aliens was not bad, and it's what really gives this installment some level of edge over the other sequels. The action was pretty much the same with the benefit of more advanced cinematic technologies, and the sequence of this film, in terms of how many people, predators and aliens are involved, dead and alive was not well presented. 5.3/10.",5,0,1,10 May 2018
Legends of the Fall," None is Fair, in Love and War.
","The funny thing is, Sam was fortunate in being naive, because he left one war that could've and would've ripped his heart clear out his chest and riddle it with more ammunition than any machine gun could ever imagine to carry, for a war far less devastating, and was fortunate enough to never even know it. Life is not for the faint at heart. Sam lost Susannah long before they went off to war, Sam lost her as soon as her and Tristan's eyes met.Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, combined with the loss of your brother, topped with the failure of securing his life and survival - especially when that was your one and only objective, the only priority, and all you cared about, allows Tristan the room he needs to seem and be dramatic, because the motivation was wonderfully captured.Susannah's heart wanted what it wanted. She had the option to remain in misery, while causing agony for Alfred, or, be in misery with the hope that Alfred (who already knew that her heart belongs to another) would somehow be capable of healing her with happiness, while still providing him the remedy of herself. Both her and Alfred were in between a rock, and a hard place, and so it was best to try while already having failed, rather than to fail without having tried.Anthony Hopkins was amazing. Aidan Quinn and Julia Ormond were also terrific. Edward Zwick you genius. James Horner, once again; from below the ground, your music still reaches beyond the skies.Legends of the Fall is life. It's heart-breaking, it's difficult, unpredictable, unfair, harsh, mean... It's, uncaring. Sam deserved to be with his love. Alfred didn't deserve the broken heart, and Susannah didn't deserve the loneliness. Tristan was in the centre of it all; Sam didn't get to be with his love because he failed him. Alfred was heart broken because Susannah wanted him, and Susannah was alone because he failed one brother and lost another; that kind, level and amount of responsibility and accountability, isn't easy.'I followed all the rules. Man's... God's. And you... You followed none of them, and they all loved you more. Samuel, father, even my own wife'. - Life. 8.3/10.",8,3,4,26 March 2018
Foxcatcher," Steve Carell, Steals the Spotlight, But Ruffalo Assists.
","From the moment Steve Carell made his first on screen appearance, you could already sense something off about his character, but because you can't imagine what it could be and whether your feelings are accurate or not, it's very easy to dismiss; however, still, you remain uneasy, and that, is just brilliant.Though I truly haven't the slightest idea as to who Dave Schultz is, Mark Ruffalo's portrayal and performance was just majestic. The mannerisms and idiosyncrasies were testament to Ruffalo's ability to harness his craft with ease and precision.Channing Tatum however, is not nearly as good as his costars, and though I don't really have a problem with him in this particular film, Channing is an awful to mediocre and forgettable actor at best, and even at his best - which I believe was the case in Foxcatcher - he isn't enough... He isn't capable. What helped him tremendously in this film, were the ranges and quality of his fellow stars.I believe Foxcatcher would've definitely benefited from the exclusion of Tatum. Ryan Gosling, James Franco, Chris Pratt, Jake Gyllenhaal... Maybe even Liam Hemsworth, any of these guys, would've assisted in bringing Foxcatcher home, and complimented everything else that was just so right with this film.Foxcatcher is a story I didn't see coming. It has a slow start, that becomes confusing, but in a good way, because it depicts senselessness in a way that creates more questions for the viewer as to why; and the answer, is surly and truly worth the wait.I'd love to give Foxcatcher a solid 8/10, but it had an element that, even with his greatest attempt, always only seems to sap away rather than contribute to, and sadly, though he was seemingly much better this time around, Channing Tatum still couldn't shy away from his natural setting; and because of that, Tatum is to Carell and Ruffalo, what du Pont was to Dave and Mark. 7.4/10.",7,1,1,1 September 2017
It Follows," Coitus Cons
","I was happy to allow this movie to make its way to a 7/10, until what happened within the 59th minute... Thereafter, there was just no way it could recover.It Follows starts off very intriguingly, and doesn't waste much time getting to the point of it's plot; that, I do like about the film.From there, dumb decisions keep getting made by the lead (Jaime), and what makes it worse, is how inexplicable and unnecessary those decisions tended to be. Also, Maika's character seemed to be irritatingly inconsistent... She kept vacillating from seeming as if she moved past the incident and its consequences, to, acting as if the incident had just occurred moments earlier.Another thing I don't like, is how It Follows ended... Given the nature of what causes the 'following', It Follows for all intents and purposes, pulled out. It just, ended, which is kind of bitter sweet, because even though this movie is filled with inessential actions, you're still kind of invested in wanting to see what happens next...And that, leads me to my next gripe. The origin of 'The Following', though perhaps it's not the movies intended bearing and arc, was completely neglected. I feel delving into what caused it to begin with, would've been incredibly exciting.Alas, even without the exploration of the origin, because I imagine that the directors intention was to leave that mystery to fester, what happened within the 59th minute, I just cannot forgive; and for that, this movie gets a stern, 5/10.It Follows is enticing... And it does evoke a lot of curiosity, however, the 59th minute, and some unnecessary moments at pivotal points, taints what was otherwise a film, kind of worth, following.",5,0,0,23 September 2016
Legend," A Cray, Kray Brotherhood.
","My first question: 'Can Reggie actually even drive'? He never ended up teaching Frances how to drive, and I believe it's because he himself, can't... All he knows, all he and his brother know, is gangsterism.Tom Hardy was excellent, and I expected no less from him. Emily Browning also displayed some quality in her performance, and was quite lovely to watch.Legend starts off very promisingly, but then with every passing minute, it deflated. In the beginning you don't really feel the puncture, however towards the end, all you want to do is pull over to the side because the ride has lost some momentum.The way the story was told and/or directed, lacked some fluidity of sorts. I mean, Reggie went to jail twice, the Richardson's rivalry flatlined, then got Ron into jail/mental hospital, Paul Bettany's character was there, then not... The timeline was, not well handled at all and, the whole coalition with the mafia, seemed to just evaporate. All of that and more happened in this movie, but it didn't really come together satisfactorily.The Kray brothers may have been the bosses of London, but sadly, somehow, this movie didn't quite portray a story I feel, needed telling. Perhaps their story is actually legendary, however, Legend failed to convince me.Again, Tom Hardy was superb, but, he wasn't enough to save this movie, as it were... Because it wasn't a bad movie at all, but, it wasn't nearly as enthralling as it could've been either. 6.4/10.And my second question: 'Why was Frances the one, narrating the film'? I find that very interesting, and not in the way Ronnie Kray found things interesting.",6,0,0,23 April 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," Infinity War is the Seventh Gem.
","Loki's arrival back in 2012, and Ultron's activation in 2015, both share a common characteristic that completely isolates Thanos. With Loki and Ultron, they both were building and establishing their attack, while The Avengers were doing the same with the extra mile of having to construct the safest form of defense. However, in contrast, Thanos has already built, structured and established his attack, while the now Non-Avengers have no idea what, when or how said attack will occur. If you understand that, I believe then, that this whole movie will fall into perspective.Thanos never made an entrance, he was always in the room all along. The Avengers were watching all the doors and guarding all the windows, from a threat that already was. From a threat that already had the keys. That is why Infinity War ended the way it did, and it was perfect.After watching this epic gargantuan of a film, I realized that Thanos HAD to win, for him to live up to who he knows he is. Who we know him to be. We, the audience and fans needed to feel true powerlessness and loss of hope, especially because Loki and Ultron failed in those pursuits, thus, Thanos HAD to succeed everywhere they failed, and Gamora further symbolized that terrifically. This was not The Avengers' movie, not by a long shot. This, was truly and utterly Thanos' exravaganza. The story, is sublime.Avengers: Infinity War was not perfect however. Far from it in fact. But, it was so massive, that its imperfections were like wrinkles on an old, Soul.This film felt rushed, but it wasn't. It was efficient, and productive, however, though that is an excellent approach for the most part for a film this huge, it also is a consequence, because it robs us of certain joys we would've loved to be immersed in.The visuals were too much of what we've seen before. Though they were amazing, they did lack a certain inspiration, and inspired moments are what we've come to expect from the MCU. The fight sequences too were not as infinitely impressive as they could've been, but they were great, with sprinkles here and there of absolutely stunning set pieces.There is so much to say about this film it's insane, from good to bad, and that is a good thing I suppose, because that means we will all be talking about this grand, monumental epic for a long while to come. 8.1/10.",8,1,3,1 May 2018
Get Out," Get Out, or Get Oust.
","As soon as hypnotism was mentioned, it immediately dawned on me that Georgina and Walter were under hypnosis, as I'm sure that was the point, since the greater reveal is far more sinister. However, though the truth was indeed more alarming, somehow it didn't quite land with that gusto.The way the reveal came to light was via mere explanation, with little to no demonstration, and was actually quite confusing. Also, the grandparents being the 'servants' had zero impact, even though I feel and know it should've had that 'OMG' effect, obviously, but sadly, it really didn't.What would've been a better reveal in my opinion, is Rose also being a pawn in all of this; now that, would've been the kicker. Picture that final scene as it is, with Chris, Walter and Rose; Chris still flashes Walter, and Rose still gives Walter the gun however, as Walter is about to shoot Rose, the flashing lights from the cop car triggers Rose's 'passenger' and as Chris realizes that Rose too is a victim, Walter pulls the trigger(insert slow motion here). And so, instead of Chris trying to strangle her, he tries to save her. This way, Rose becomes a far greater redeeming quality than Georgina, for Chris, as an added bonus. And, as an added, added bonus on top of that, it would assist greatly, in at least not painting the ENTIRE white cast as, evil.The whole family being in on it felt, shortchanged. Get Out was entertaining, but it was missing something and the reveal wasn't awesome enough, or it wasn't revealed as awesomely as it could've.Of course, given the angle chosen, there has to be an underlying message to this film, of sociopolitical issues among other matters, and that is impossible to ignore, and perhaps aids in stealing some of the shine from this film unfortunately. The undisclosed narrative may be true, however, in the interest of putting art before politics, Get Out was less than it should've been, but much more than what it could've been. 6.5/10.",6,1,3,21 May 2018
Drive," Cruise Control.
","The way Drive was shot was quite fascinating and Ryan Gosling with the utmost ease, provided extra magnetism to have you fully committed in following Ryan's character and seeing where and how this all ends.The pace of this film was quite unexpected, and one would think that given the impression Drive gives, the pace it took would be too sedate, however, it wasn't. If anything, it was definitely far more thrilling and engaging that expected, though perhaps it was due to the fact that, even with it's very steady pace, Drive still did very well in cutting forward to relevant scenes, and leaving the rest to the wayside.About Ryan's character's name, I didn't realize until the movie was over, as to what they did there, which just made me love it more.The story is pretty simple, but still quite fresh. Carey Mulligan was very sweet and inviting in front of the camera, and the music was noticeably capturing. How the movie ended, it is extremely arguable that it didn't need to go down in that fashion. In fact, the argument would lean more towards it being an unnecessary ending, than necessary.Overall however, Drive shifted gears smoothly, and the ride was a well accomplished 5 minutes of cruise control.7.4/10.",7,0,0,4 May 2017
The Theory of Everything," A Brief 2 Year History of Time.
","I wonder if not showing the timeline was in an attempt to somehow, artistically, represent Hawking's theory of time? If so, it would be a rather neat touch, and an appropriate and appreciable nod to Hawking's Bestseller.Though this movie does suck one in quite a bit, it really did break my heart, in a manner that diminishes the film, and that too, sucks quite a bit. What's heartbreaking isn't necessarily Stephen's disease, though it is incredibly sad; no, what's heartbreaking is his and Jane's separation. It was inevitable from the moment she said she loves him, and the reason their divorce ruins this film - besides the fact that The Theory of Everything feels a lot like a story of love, is because she truly did, but life, as it loves to do and do so incredibly, unbelievably, amazingly and breathtakingly well, got in their way.After all those years of her taking such good care of him, their kids and their unity, for it to end period, almost demonstrates the uselessness and power of time. Maybe it's because it's a biography, but it really is quite dispiriting.Also, I feel as though this film arguably, somewhat brings Stephen Hawking's integrity into question. Jane could've left, but she didn't, however, the first chance Stephen got seemingly, and not that he did it purposefully, he left. Maybe Jane stayed out of obligation, but, did Stephen also then not owe her the same courtesy?With all of that said, Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones exhibit some wonderful performances, and Johann Johannsson's composition is heartrending... It's moving. 7.3/10.",7,0,0,17 September 2017
Good Will Hunting," Before Jason Bourne.
","Though Good Will Hunting was a very enjoyable movie, I couldn't help but feel that Will, is a bit of a superhero; He can win a street fight, and a mental fight, while taking on a psychological fight and an emotional fight, which too, he won. Then I later realized that perhaps, Will Hunting is, Jason Bourne.Everybody was on Will's side, and because of that, he unfortunately came across as an unappreciative, immature, unnaturally lucky and somewhat spoilt little ass. However still, it was relatable to some extent. Having the potential to change the world, but having no one willing to fight with you and for you to realize that potential is a reality for so many... A lot of people have been given up on, and that can instill an immense amount of fear.Robin Williams was awesome and Minnie Driver just well, drove it home. She was stunning, sexy and her performance just pulled you in. The directing was a tad bit choppy though, however it wasn't too distracting. The Affleck brothers and Skarsgard were also good. 7/10.",7,0,0,25 February 2018
X-Men: Apocalypse," Apocalypse: Only a Supervillain, not an Event
","This movie is by no means, bad... In fact, it is a very enjoyable watch. Bryan Singer paid attention to story, however, 2 big problems arise from the ashes Apocalypse wanted to build upon.Firstly; Apocalypse wasn't supposed to just be the main villain, he was also supposed to be THE event, an apocalyptic event - I'm sorry, but after 16 years, the wait doesn't quite feel over just yet... Sadly, he was incredibly underplayed. The dude is immortal, period! He can alter his molecular form to suit any situation... He can possess any being of his choosing, at will... Transform different parts of his body into weapons simultaneously, and absorb energy... So, Cyclops is probably the WORST person to fight him! Also, as far as I know, Apocalypse already had telepathic abilities... The man is damn near impossible to defeat, but I understand that it has to be done, however, the way in which it was done, though very enjoyable to watch, wasn't good enough. Phoenix had to do it, but, was Jean ready to transform? And also, were the humans, the human race aware, that uuhhm, the world might end? I mean... the apocalypse was, so contained that, I could've been in Egypt watching Survivor, while completely unaware that I may not.However though, a lot about him, was done right... Was done very well. His ability to enhance powers, his demagogue ability... His apparent bond with celestial technology... His presence as a whole, was arrogant and powerful (nicely done Oscar), and I liked that.Second problem; You spend the whole movie trying to figure out if, the time line makes sense... I mean, Apocalypse is the 8th installment of this universe, and they've been going so back and forth in time that, I may just get a second shot at that other love of my life that got away back in 2007, in 2007. But whats awesomely annoying is, Bryan Singer may be linking the times like a pro.From there, Quicksilver - the only thing Fox did far better than Marvel - was amazing. Xavier, Magneto, Beast and Nightcrawler delivered. Mystique... I don't know, Jennifer didn't feel like she wanted to be there. Jean, Cyclops and Havok, the relations were relayed well, Psylocke (who's so very hot) and Angel were, meh... And Storm... (Alexandra also, so very hot), OK.Disappointed, no. Apocalypse could've blown me away, but, I'm happy to stay. 7/10.",7,18,30,4 June 2016
Ex Machina," cleAVAge
","After watching this movie, the first question I asked myself was; Alex, Alex Garland, who hurt you???What I love about this movie is that, you understand all 3 of the main character's perspectives. They are all justifiable in their cause. For me, this movies' pace allowed me to stretch my imagination to the extent of permeabilizing a good portion of all the possible outcomes.Self preservation vs self-consciousness vs self. This movie entices you into picking a side... An angle... But at the same time, temps you on occasion, to switch, and that, is very engaging.If in the end, you make the right choice in who to vet, you may feel quite chuffed with yourself... But, even if you bet on the wrong horse, I feel, who could blame you really?!I enjoyed this movie thoroughly... It messes with your mind, and I guess that rarely, is ever a bad thing.Also, now I really can't wait to see Oscar Isaac as En Sabah Nur... He played The God Complex like a star.",7,0,1,8 January 2016
Prisoners," Prisoners Are Pre-sinners.
","Once you get the full picture of this film, it all starts to make sense in a very smart manner, a manner that during the course of the film itself, feels somewhat elongated and confusing.Who is Alex, who is he protecting and why after all that torture? Then Taylor comes along and you feel that he is the one being protected, yet, his IQ seems no higher than that of Alex's. Then you have the corpse, a disappearing uncle, an arbitrary abductee, a priest with a crypt like room, an old woman who doesn't seem as bothered as she should be about her seemingly missing nephew and hell, even a detective who has a suspicious 100% solved cases track record.All that very 'up in the air' type of set up, during a 150 minute running time and a very eerie approach from the director and composer creates the needed suspense true, but also, there was a little bit of confusion or perhaps, impatience accompanied with the enthrallment, that causes the chosen angle of the reveal to be marginally underwhelming, but still ultimately, very impressive.The performances were great, from everyone involved (Gyllenhaal's exccessive blinking was a nice touch, though at times he'd abandon it) and the story was executed very competently, especially given the films' title. There is a chain of prisoners, in plain sight and also, hidden in plain sight.A crafty 7.4/10.",7,0,1,2 April 2017
Logan," Slogan: Logan is Good, But Not a Masterpiece.
","I don't know if this was a superhero film, or if it was a drama/action movie with a 'superhero' lead backdrop. As grounded and realistic as Logan was, it also lacked that sense of adventure and fantasy, however, that is not this movie's greatest problem(s).Logan never really did explain why or what was happening to, well, Logan. Why was he weak, tired and seemingly not healing? Logan is set after Days of Future Past, and DofP ends around X2 or X-Men at the earliest, so, that means at most Logan/Wolverine has aged ONLY 29 years in Logan, and that's NOTHING for him, so why, is he so weary? How or why is the adamantium now suddenly killing him? It's not explained, and it's suspect how even when the adamantium was 'mentioned' as the cause, it was mentioned almost, in passing.Also, Logan and Laura's quest to Eden didn't provide any closure. Did Laura and her friends actually reach Eden? Does Eden actually exist? If it does, is it in fact a Safe Haven? We don't know, and I doubt very much that Mangold intended for an Inception type ending here.Then we have the family that died, the Munsons. No acknowledgement at all of the destruction Logan and Co. brought upon that innocent family was mentioned. Logan talks about how Xavier, Caliban and HIMSELF never asked for this, and he doesn't mention the very family who didn't ask for it the most, and probably ended up dying the most brutal death of all in comparison to everyone else.One more thing; Are we happy with how X-24 died?Logan is DEFINITELY not a bad movie, it is quite good, but, I genuinely do feel that people went crazy over it based on this 'super grounded' approach it took. But being grounded is not enough to constitute as a 'Masterpiece'. I mean, apart from the above mentioned issues, you also have things like the fight sequences feeling incredibly monotonous and repetitive, especially because of that groundedness... The fights were no different to action movies' constant swinging punches, except this time, it's with claws.Logan is good, but not perfect or 'near perfect'. It's enjoyable, but it is not a 'masterpiece'. A solid 7/10.",7,0,1,20 January 2018
Avengers: Age of Ultron," An AWESOME Disappointment
","This movie was meant to be the biggest movie, not only of 2015, but of all time thus far; however, it buckled under all that weight. But that's the thing about this movie, that, it is sooo big, that even under all that pressure, and under the awesome wielding of Whedon, a failure (in comparison to what it was meant to be) still managed to be the best blockbuster of 2015, outright and hands down.Joss Whedon, like Christopher Nolan, is one hell of an intelligent director, and you sense it in his rendition. Age of Ultron didn't live up to it's potential fine; some scenes felt rushed or short lived, some fight sequences left you wanting, but, the story was fluent, the acting - quality, and the effects, stunning. Ben Davis, again was amazing, and overall, I love how enormous, this movie was. This is what you do, with a budget upwards of $250 Million Dollars.The comedic aspect was over done, and it's obvious why; it is Marvel's modus operandi, not Whedons... Like how The Wachowski's fell into that trap with Jupiter Ascending. Whedon is a dark, and in-depth story teller, and I wish they would've let him be that.Furious 7 and Jurassic World do not deserve a higher grossing than this marvelous Whedon work, but, it is what it is.I want to give Age of Ultron 8/10, but it was meant to be 9.5/10, so, I'll give 7.9/10. Well done Whedon and team.",7,2,7,22 December 2015
Snowden," Our Eyes, Their WebSight.
","The problem is this; If you just make it publicly known that; 'Your information is being surveilled', without really digging deep into the ramifications of such an invasion, the public won't care, much like the more recent Facebook scandal. What I'm trying to say is, news feel like just news, not reality. News feel like that 30 minutes with adverts in between, like a TV show.'Verizon is hacking into all your phone calls' is interpreted by the public as; 'Sure, but not my phone calls'. I mean here we are, 'reviewing' on IMDb without a care as to what is being tapped into.Films like Snowden and The Big Short, and and and, are important and more than just movies. Their topics are difficult to articulate perhaps, but, they transcend entertainment.As a film however, Snowden was sluggish at points, but I do feel it did put in a concerted effort to simplify as best as it could, the applications and repercussions of the missions and actions in play.This movie also kept unveiling some pretty serious star power I didn't know it had, and of that star presence, Zachary Quinto was the most quintessential.Some aspects in Snowden were hard to follow; 'All this effing intelligence jargon is hurting our brains'. That line was so appropriate, true (Hell, it even gave Ed himself a seizure, and they called it 'epilepsy') and incredibly funny, that it showed me that Snowden was self aware, however, amidst all that jargon, I understood one thing as it was mentioned; Going to Hawaii was OBVIOUSLY a TERRIBLE idea, if the aim was for Ed to have, 'less stress'!!!Like I said, Snowden is one of those movies that, expose a truth that never really dies, no matter how much it's said that it has, and that is significant. And, in this movie, that story is illustrated quite efficiently, though a bit slow at times. 7/10.",7,0,0,27 May 2018
Groundhog Day," You Got Me Babe, You Lost Me Babe.
","I've come to realize that Groundhog Day is quite the classic for many, so, I decided to watch it, and see for myself what all the fuss is about.Before you judge my review, please consider the rationale. Groundhog Day had 3 major problems. One problem is easy to overcome as a viewer, and perhaps, given that this movie was made over 20 years ago, one could perhaps, forgive it. The 2nd, a little harder to ignore, because it felt an unnecessary issue for the director to allow. The 3rd problem however, is a major one for the viewer to neglect, because Love, is a language much, much, much older, than just 20 years.1. The time logic of the repetition itself. Phil's 3rd Groundhog Day, he skipped the coffee, and was far more hurried, yet, he still met Ned at the exact same point, and was also still late for the report, as if, everybody else was moving relative to his pace. That is just one example. But to be fair, I'd be willing to let it go.2. Why was Phil experiencing repetitiveness? What caused it and when? Was it all about Rita perhaps? It being about Rita is a conclusion/assumption, not an explanation. And if it were in fact about Rita, why did the repetition not begin at the station, where he first seemed to feel something for her? Now one has to wonder, does Punxsutawney have something to do with it? Probably not, but this is not properly explained.3. Forget the first 2 issues, those can be, ignored if one really wants to. the 3rd problem however, cannot. Groundhog Day doesn't have that 'Moment of Reckoning' for Phil to overcome. As a romance story, that is especially important to never overlook. True love comes from Phil - upon finally experiencing the next day - telling Rita that, his 'versatility' is nothing but a cheat. Also, he should explain to her that, when it all began, he exploited the situation, and he exploited others, especially women. Without any of that confessed and acknowledged, Rita is in love, effectively, with a fraud. He may have mentioned part of all of that before, but that was during the phenomenon, and thus, she forgot.Now, those 3 issues, put together with Phil NEVER even once, trying to figure out why this is happening to him, and trying other ways besides suicide, like leaving Punxsutawney, to find a fix and doing stupid things without even knowing how long this phenomenon will persist, put together with splattered moments here and there of weariness, Groundhog Day is a fun movie, but, it is not a classic.I really was hoping for a Romance classic, like Jerry Maguire, but... 6/10 it is, it is.",6,2,6,23 May 2017
Don't Breathe," Breath of Fresh Scare.
","Thrilling and utterly entertaining. The biggest, and arguably the only stupid mistake made by any of those kids was Money shooting at the lock, however, they needed to get that lock open, and whatever method they were going to use - short of liquid nitrogen - was probably always going to be loud.From there, the movie proceeds quite competently, and of course Don't Breathe is the type of movie where that is the make or break. Money, Rocky and Alex go in house. Alex decides it's too dangerous and leaves. Blind Man kills Money. Rocky is understandably in shock. Alex comes back because he heard the shot and wants to protect Rocky. Once back in the house, Alex enters a situation that's already running at full speed. From there, these two kids, these inexperienced and scared out of their mind kids, are up against a veteran on his own turf... Plus, that damn dog.Rocky stole the money because, why not? That is the mission and you might as well. Sure, Money is dead, but, you're already in the situation, so, you make the best of it. Rocky needs that money, so they can't call the cops. So, it makes sense to try and escape, then call in an anonymous tip later. The Blind Man knows that house like the back of his hand, so, him keeping them hostage was very believable.Don't Breathe is a film of antiheroes and anti-villains, and that is what keeps it fresh. Nobody in this movie is all good, but they all, (except Money hence his death) have motives worth looking in to. 7/10.",7,0,2,18 March 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," GotG Volume, Mute.
","As much of a bigger, more extravagant, more visually stunning and far more expansive of an exhibition Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was, it suffered extraordinarily from seemingly becoming a mockery, or a parody of sorts, of its own profound self. A self inflicted injury sadly, that diminishes the enjoyment and deteriorates the intense core of the film.One could argue that the dynamics of the actual guardians themselves is to express emotional connection to each other in a silly manner, because that is their language and it works for them, and us as the viewer just need to realize it, and understand it... Sadly though, that doesn't work for me. A vast majority of this films humor and silliness only achieved being a detergent to almost all the deeper elements Gunn was attempting to express.Though GotGv2 may not be the weakest in the Marvel Universe, I do believe it is the one Marvel got the most wrong, because it had the most elements I've seen gotten right, just to fall victim to the most elements gotten wrong. Is it better than its predecessor or even Iron Man 2? Yes, yes it is... But, if they hadn't gotten it this wrong, the question could've been rather; Is it better than Captain America: Civil War. No question; with this particular final product, no, no it is not.GotGv2 honestly, felt like a bouquet of eye-catching flowers that didn't belong together, and had conflicting aromas that in isolation were fragrant, but together, smelt like gasoline; A scent that for some, smells sinfully good, and for others, just bad.The story was a tangent, and Gunn saw this, and tried to tie the knot stronger by bringing us closer to Rocket, but unfortunately, this was not enough. Tyler Bates' score, somewhat erratic. The performance from the stars, was so incredibly stifled by the script, and all that unnecessary humor.GotGv2 could've obliterated its antecedent, but because it was only slightly better (and quite honestly, maybe even not better at all), means it disappointed greatly. It's not a matter of expectations not met, it's a matter of potential lost. The Guardians were 'on blast', but their Galaxy, proved too vast a Volume 2 handle.",6,3,8,2 May 2017
Whiplash," A Beat Down, for a Drum Up.
","An emotional roller coaster ride, that has you vouching for in one minute, then routing against in the next, leaving you with, well, inner whiplash... And this is one of the reasons I give this film an 8/10.Whiplash lived up to its name in so many ways... Emotionally, creatively and musically.Emotionally: Fletcher is a good guy, then bad... Then good again, then bad. Then, once he tells his side of the story, though you're tired of jolting back and forth, you feel you've finally reached his true persona... Then just like that, once again, he switches... Then switches again at the end, and what we're left with is; A question mark. An emotional injury that may have healed, is healing... Or maybe, not.Creatively: Andrew literally, experienced whiplash, on his way to performing Whiplash... And he didn't let it stop him, until he was halted by the whiplash, of performing Whiplash... That, and how he decided to end his blossoming relationship with Nicole.Musically: The composition's greatest struggle, was, Tempo. Whiplash shifted between tempos so abruptly, and had a solo that needed the intensity and speed bleeding was needed to achieve.Whiplash felt authentic. The narrative was gripping and the finale was hypnotizing. I don't want to lie, at parts, I felt both Teller and Simmons could've done better - be pushed a little further as it were, however, the story carried an intelligence worth heavy consideration.Also... What happened to the drums folder, seriously?",8,1,2,15 October 2016
The Green Mile," When the Clock Strikes Ten.
","Frank Darabont and Stephen King. They have to be one of Hollywood's greatest combinations. They are just, magic.The Green Mile is a film I've been delaying to watch based on the feeling of knowing how amazing it must be, so looking forward to it was pleasure enough. Sadly, I knew sooner or later I'd have to watch it. Now that I have, I both regret and appreciate having watched it. Regret because, it was in fact, as amazing as I thought it would be, and now I've watched it, thus I can't ever unwatch it, just to relive watching it again.This film is over 180 minutes long, and 90 minutes in, I checked how much more of the movie was left; seeing that there was another 90 minutes to go felt like nothing but, joy. At no point did I want this film to end.Every cast member, including Mr. Jingles, applause. Frank Darabont on the directors chair, excellent. Thomas Newman, could've been a little bit more emotive, because this film is at that level, but, he was wonderful nonetheless.And then the story. What I kept asking, and knew of course would have to be addressed is; How are they going to let John die? How, and why? The fact that the initial answer to that question wasn't the only answer/conclusion, just made me appreciate King and/or Darabont's expertise, methodology, precision and sheer intellect even more.For many I feel that, John's explanation to Paul for why he is ready to die was enough, when it actually wasn't. I could sense strongly that it wasn't, but I was willing to let it go because I felt no further consequence, would arise, but clearly, Stephen/Darabont weren't done just yet... They infected the story, with that extra bit of life.The Green Mile is classic material, a must watch and didn't run a minute too long. 8.4/10.",8,0,0,15 June 2017
Kong: Skull Island," Kong: Dull Island.
","Well, Kong: Skull Island is as generic as they come. It's not exciting at all, but somewhat enjoyable and competent. No twists, no turns, it is what it is, also, it's Godzilla, except Kong.Hiddleston money shot was kind of ridiculous; him demanding Reilly's sword, then the weird and badly executed slow motion through the 'toxic gas', that didn't seem all that toxic, at all... Leaving Reilly without a weapon while those pterosaur's fly all over the place. That scene was just so transparent.Another transparent, badly executed and forgettable scene was Shea's character sacrificing himself for the group... Just to have that 'skull-crawler' inexplicably hit him with its tale instead of eating him. The movie straight cut to the next scene immediately afterwards, and nobody mourned and celebrated the poor sod.The interaction/rapport between Jason Mitchell and Shea Whigham was again so obvious in its failed attempt and Brie and Tom's chemistry was lacking.The CGI wasn't bad, it was pretty good actually, and Skull Island (the CGI'd island itself) was quite satisfying... Though, why was there one of every animal, especially that gigantic insect with legs that look like the trees they were walking through? It was by far the most interesting threat, and when Reilly mentioned 'killer ants', I thought he meant that creature, but, nothing came of that comment.Also, Reilly said; 'You don't want to be out here at night' in a very cautionary fashion, then, we never shown why the night is so dangerous.Then the not so thrilling easter egg... Where I have a feeling Kong vs Godzilla is going to be just as dry as its origin build ups.Oh well, like I said, generic, but somewhat enjoyable. 5.8/10.",6,0,0,21 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The War is Lost: Episode III
","Undoubtedly the best of the 3 prequels... But, to be honest, I'm impressed by this movie, only when comparing it to it's 2 predecessors. The first 2 - The Phantom Menace (1999) and The Attack of the Clones (2002) are so horrendous, that by just being better than them, Revenge of the Sith feels amazing... But, it's not.However 1 thing that this movie did very well, though it might sound like an insult, but it's really a compliment... Revenge of the Sith shed light, as to how badly the first 2 were executed, because of how it's execution, was delivered far more effectively.Hard to believe actually, that all 3 of these movies were directed by the same person.Stars Wars remains one of the worst series I've seen thus far, even more so, because of the fact that, only after watching Episode III, do I realize how amazing this Saga could've been, but, it was just thrown to the wolves.It wasn't as agonizing watching this Episode, but, it's certainly not a 'Dark Path' I would dare, encourage again.",4,2,7,2 January 2016
The Secret Life of Pets," Barked Up the Wrong Tree.
","Though the script had some amazingly funny lines - like how these animated movies tend to have - the execution was too insufficient, and also, The Secret Life of Pets took it's licence to be 'zany', way, way too far, to the point where the movie started losing its plot completely.The cast was honestly a combination of highs and lows, that ultimately culminated into a sub par cast that couldn't deliver as well as the script deserved. I wasn't aware that Max was being voiced by Louis C.K., or that Snowball was voiced by Kevin Hart. These are 2 Hollywood stars who don't rank very high in my books, and without knowing that they were part of this cast, I could sense still, the shortcomings of both their characters.The directing and direction this movie took was choppy, ridiculous, even for an animation about pets, and at points, boring, which would explain all the unnecessary turns taken in this film to keep it fresh perhaps. Even as a dog lover, I couldn't connect with any of the pets, and at no point did this film manage the 'warm and fuzzy' effect.A pig, lizard and bunny hijacking an incessant animal control duo, that appears everywhere and anywhere just at the right time - and not in that 'meant to be funny kind of way', no, they're just Animal Control that just keeps popping up, going after 2 dogs ONLY, in ALL of New York City AND Brooklyn... Being hijacked by a pig, lizard and bunny!An entire community of sewer strays, blocking The Brooklyn Bridge, after a bunny and a dog stole a bus... A friggin' bus. This is stupid because, this movie is set in a world where humans are not oblivious or ignorant to such and animals are expected and only known to behave like how animals realistically and normally behave, however, hey... A crocodile is getting a beat down from a little white fluffy Pomeranian on The Brooklyn Bridge, and not a single human finds this rather peculiar at least? OK.All that aside however, what disappoints me the most about this film is its well written but at so many points, either badly executed or just shy of well executed, lines. The script deserved a better cast overall, and the directing/story, ultimately was a collapsing and an incomplete mess. 4.5/10.",4,1,2,22 April 2017
Arrival," Kangaroo.
","What Arrived weren't aliens, what Arrived, was the future. Arrival tackles an issue never really fully explored before, and dissects it to point where it reveals a different dimension in a form that dares to push the limits of what we've seen time and time again.It was obvious early on in the movie that the alien life wasn't here to harm, but the journey taken to explore that probability was well thought out and entertaining to watch. Communication is a powerful tool, and that is what Arrival was about, communication and understanding.What 'kangarooed' me however, were the explosives. The team that goes up there every 22 hours, knew what they just did, yet they still allowed for Louise and Ian to go back up knowing fully well that the 5 minutes they require, will literally go up in smoke. After it did, neither Louise or Ian cared to confront what had just happened, and Colonel Weber didn't seem to be bothered of their safety either, when they were trying to gather more information on what was a very vague response. That entire part of Arrival, jerked the film substantially for me.Apart from that, Arrival was engaging, and its twist of using the future from beginning to end, as a past trying to explain time without either, and as a memory to stop it from not happening was interesting, though, Dr. Banks' 'choice' is an aspect of discussion that opens up another can of worms. The little girl being called Hannah too, was a nice touch, it was a fine metaphor.Thought went into this movie, and it was a pretty big idea that remained grounded, which is also great, while also, being gripping. What I love the most about Arrival is how it was approached... That angle gives it a mean edge, and that together with quality directing, scoring and acting, though seemingly flawed at some points, makes Arrival bTeHtAtNeGrOOD. 7.6/10.",Null,0,3,3 September 2017
The Blind Side," It's A Family Tradition.
","I absolutely love Sandra Bullock. She is elegant and just so charming with every performance, and her execution in this film is another triumph. With that said however, I will admit that sadly, I don't feel that this was an Oscar Winning performance. Again, I absolutely love Sandra, and her portrayal in this film is awesome, but... Oscar, not too convinced.The Blind Side is incredibly enjoyable and a pleasure to watch. It is heartwarming, and quite inspiring, but, I feel that it really could've been more - still remain what it is, but more. The editing and direction was somewhat uneven... The pace, a tad bit unstable, but again, enjoyable.My biggest problem with The Blind Side though, was Quinton Aaron. This role proved too big and too heavy for him to carry. Outright, Quinton Aaron was unsatisfactory. He just, couldn't deliver, and the film suffered greatly because of it, given his role. It's obvious almost, that a limited amount of actors could play the role of 'Big Mike', considering the age and size combo, and that worked well for Quinton, but, I feel, at the demise of Michael Oher's story.Tim McGraw and Jae Head were awesome and their characters were somehow the glue that put this story together very well. They may not have had big roles, but, they played extremely necessary parts.The Blind Side could've easily been a 7+/10, but the editing, direction and Quinton's woeful outing, compromised what was an absolute joy to watch otherwise.6.4/10.",6,1,2,18 August 2017
The Big Short," 4 'W473r Bubbl3' 1s N3x7.
","I would've given The Big Short an 8/10 if I just understood it better. I definitely get its premise and focus, and the ultimate plot, but I don't quite grasp the mechanics of the situation. This is in no way the film's fault, this one is purely on me.For instance, when the movie ended, Michael Burry went to his board and wrote; +489%. I thought what had happened was, even though Burry was right, sadly because of the Bank Institutions Fraud, his $1.3 Billion investment dwindled to $489 Million (there is an email he sends), in a scrabble to sell off Swaps he purchased, thus perhaps dropping the value of the Hedge Fund to around -55%, especially since the Fund just kept losing more and more value due to the payments Burry had to make to those banks. But then underneath, was the $2.69 Billion total profit. So, is he closing down the Fund because the business murders ones soul or is he leaving because he lost, though cheated. There were many other points that maybe were a bit much for me to grasp, however, that is a plus for me with this particular film; it got me so invested, I wanted to understand every bit of it.The Big Short is, the type of eye opener that makes one wonder if maybe, this is now finally being exposed, as a strategy to hiding an even bigger agenda. Get us to focus on something that happened so many years ago, to get our eyes off what's starting to happen now. In a nutshell, The Big Short awakens paranoia. Is that a good thing? As a film, definitely.Christian Bale just blew me away. I loved Gosling, Pitt, Carell and even Magaro and Wittrock, but Bale, was amazing. Honestly, Carell too was amazing. The writing, the story, the directing, absolutely stunning. All this time (prior to watching the movie) I thought the main characters are all in this together, just to find that they're not... But, they are.'They knew. They knew the taxpayer would bail them out. They weren't stupid, they just didn't care'. That is just too, too profound. It's not a script. It's not fiction. This, actually, happened, in the very reality in which we exist.This film is possibly an 8 and above out of ten, but, there were parts that I didn't understand, again, not because the film fell short, but rather because my knowledge lacked. So, 7.5/10.P.S. Michael continues to flex his ability to foresee impending doom. A water crisis is not a movie anymore, it's happening, it's now. To me, to you, IMDb, United States to South Africa, from Paramount to all of us. Burry is not wrong... He is a genius. Ben Rickert too, is on to something.",7,6,8,18 June 2017
Prometheus," A Titan Title, Where the Pro, is For Progress... Finally.
","It took an entire 33 years, for this Alien franchise to show any signs or promise of progress. A WHOLE 33 years. Alien sparked questions it didn't answer, however, that is understandable as it was the first and posing questions was its role. However, Cameron's Aliens, Fincher's Alien 3 and Jean-Pierre's Resurrection did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, NOTHING, NO-THING, to move this story forward, and for that, Prometheus is automatically FAR, FAR, FAR, better.What are these aliens? Where do they come from? What do they want? The planet on which they were found, is that their home? If not, who's home was it before their invasion? These are some of the many questions that, 3 sequels and 2 spin-offs over a period of THIRTY THREE (33) YEARS, NEVER, EVER, WHATSOEVER, bothered to address, or even acknowledge, until Prometheus.Admittedly, the characters in Prometheus, including their actions, seem a bit warped at times. Charlie seems to give up INCREDIBLY easily. 1 visit to the alien ship, with zero exploration anywhere else, including all the many other parts of said ship, and he is ready to completely give up, after a lifetime worth of work, and a once in a lifetime opportunity. The 2 copilots felt extremely random. Janek seemed majorly unbothered, even at the expense of his fellow crew members. Miss Vickers it appears, should've really stayed on earth, though in her defense, there is a part in the film where she provides some acceptable rationale, when talking to her father. And David, at some points was intelligible, and then at others, inconsistently questionable.However, because this film FINALLY addressed questions lingering for DECADES, with ultimately awesome answers actually, it was thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining. The aliens were manufactured by a superior version of humanity, who created humans too, and now seemingly want to use those aliens to destroy us. Why? How? When?Prometheus is NOT perfect. It is very flawed. While taking place in 2094, Prometheus is before Alien, which took place in 2037, among many of its imperfections, including mainly how it handled its characters. However, the story finally moved forward, but more importantly and relevantly, in an EXCITING way, with perhaps the most incredibly appropriate titan, I mean, title.Here's to hoping we don't have to wait until 2045 to find out who this superior race of humans actually are, where they come from and what their agenda is. 7/10.",7,0,0,13 May 2018
Wonder Woman," No, It's Wonder's Land.
","Here goes. Wonder Woman is worthy, I am not in any way at all, taking that away from it, however, this film has faults too, just too severe to justify a 93% rating. Wonder Woman is a solid 7.2/10, but I feel when it comes to DC, many critics and fans alike just seem to miss the appropriate appreciation. BvS and Suicide Squad were rated way too low, and Man of Steel was just robbed of its excellence, and now, Wonder Woman is rated way too high. 93% is The Dark Knight, The Avengers, Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Iron Man level... Wonder Woman, is not that.Firstly, let me get into its positives. The script, is well constructed and executed. The story is awesome, cohesive and gripping. Gal Gadot for me is always only as good as her talent allows her to be. She is always, or at least, most of the time, adequate for her roles, and it's no different here. Chris Pine, I'm an absolute fan, and I was afraid that his talents would be misrepresented by a forced dialogue and script; what an amazing surprise it was to see that Jenkins and Co. nailed him so well.Now, the problems that Wonder Woman had. I'll mention this one first, because it's importance is based on Warner Bros. making the same mistakes as they did with previous DCEU installments, except this time, it's the other way around.Wonder Wonder, with the awesome script and performances it accomplished, deserved the budget BvS had, and BvS deserved the budget Wonder Woman had (sadly BvS's substandardness could only be known after the fact). This film was impacted negatively by its shoddy editing, questionable cinematography at so many points, and just badly executed fight sequences, all because the budget was thin, based on Warner Bros.'s fear from past outcomes - and we've become accustomed to a certain level of quality, or at least I know I have. There were even points, where Wonder Woman herself, seemed like nothing but a computer generated concoction.Ares!!! Why? Why was he included in this Wonder Woman? He was a perfect setup as Wonder Woman's ultimate nemesis, in later installments such as, Wonder Woman 3 perhaps. The writers and Jenkins built him up and set him up PERFECTLY... Just so perfectly, but then, he was wasted on a shoestring budget, 15 minutes towards the end of the movie, with armor equivalent to Tony Stark's Mark I when he was stuck in the cave. Ares, who's not only the God of War, but also, the Death God was incredibly, just so unbelievably wasted, and this, cannot by anyone, be denied.Lastly I'll mention, whether you like it or not; Wonder Woman, as enjoyable as it was, was very, very reminiscent of 1. Thor and 2. Captain America: The First Avenger, all the way down to the British flag waving at the end of the movie. I kept trying to overlook it, but as the story progressed, the harder it became, to a point where it felt like I was watching Captain Thor: The First League Member.Wonder Woman is awesome, better than Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2., it truly is. The script is on point (though arguably, Steve didn't need to approach the end like he did), Gal was nice, Chris was amazing, the humor was damn near perfect, Rupert Gregson-Williams is deadly on the score and everybody else played their parts like pros, but I can't help but feel that, Warner Bros. played too many of their cards, because Ares, was not at all supposed to be the main villain of this movie. Ares's wasted appearance, the lackluster budget (and keep in mind, this is a blockbuster and a proper budget is part of its armor) and a story too, reminiscent of Marvel's previous installments, compromise what was actually, something awesome to watch.Is it a 93%? Not by a long shot whatsoever. Is it a good movie however, hells yeah it is. 7.2/10.",7,5,11,6 June 2017
Black Panther," Step Into the Spotlight.
","We all know that the MCU, more now than before, has been incredibly inclined towards humour, and in some of their installments have gotten it wrong; e.g. Age of Ultron and Ragnarok, however they've also gotten it right in other films such as Ant-Man and Homecoming. Black Panther, I'm so happy to say, falls firmly in the latter. The humour in this film is so well placed that I can't understand how MCU fails then, to consistently get it right, but I imagine it's all poised on who the director is. With that said, Black Panther is NOT perfect, it is very flawed, mainly due to one very major aspect.One thing Black Panther just got wrong, was Black Panther himself, and though it may be understandable is to how they made that mistake, as an MCU/comics/film fan, I can't ignore that fact/issue.Truthfully (and I hope you can try to appreciate this perspective), for these African cultures, unknown to the planet, to be put on the world stage in a positive light through such an established franchise on such a big scale for the very first time, is a moment both 'black' and 'white' America and the rest of the world can't fully imagine. Be African, in Africa and watch isiXhosa, a language spoken by millions in South Africa (a country, not an area) on global display, and then the Motlatsi, Sefate, Khotso and Morena (seSotho for King) apparel and heritage being put on the map, then watch Black Panther; it was sentimental, however, that was both a good thing, and a bad thing.Marvel Studios and Ryan Coogler didn't get the balance right. They focused way too much on portraying a culture and used the Black Panther as it's driving force, and thus neglected fleshing out Black Panther. So, Black Panther was illustrated during a celebration that wasn't necessarily part of the Black Panther arc. That was a major problem. Africa deserves to be recognized by the world, and doing it through Black Panther was right because of it's magnitude and inspiration, however was done wrong, because of the equilibrium.All that aside however, I absolutely loved the cast; notably Lupita Nyong'o and Angela Bassett,and specifically, Letitia Wright, Michael B. Jordan and Andy Serkis; they were just too amazing.The visuals were stunning, however the pacing was off from time to time. The score was pretty good, and the story was more than satisfactory while the script was crisp.Again, Black Panther is not perfect. Pacing, balancing and neglect issues, with an amazing cast that delivered on a solid script with stunning visuals made Black Panther a very enjoyable watch, with a side of; it could've easily been better. 7/10.",7,12,25,18 February 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Dawn of Injustice
","I'll begin with this; Man of Steel is by far, superior in almost every way. How some could even say: 'This is what Man of Steel was supposed to be' is beyond me.Batman vs Superman is 2 and half hours of what feels like half told stories. But that's what happens, when you're trying to squeeze years of story-line, in a short period of time, because the rest of it you wasted doing... Hell, DC/WB didn't even waste that time doing something... They literally spent all that time doing, NOTHING!Henry Cavill in Man of Steel, was a bit of a flat character, however, in BvsS, he was inflated a little bit... Which is good, but on the other side of the coin, yes, we are going to compare Affleck to Bale. Though actually, I didn't have a problem with Affleck's rendition, ultimately, he was a bit 2 dimensional. He wasn't good or bad, here nor there... He was just, Batman.Wonder Woman??? Why was she there exactly? Oh wait, maybe it's because Snyder needed to introduce 5 new characters, in some innovative way for all of them individually... and he succeeded in doing so for exactly, ZERO of them. Aqua, Cyborg and Flash's teasers/introductions ranged from awful to lackluster.The fight sequences were heavily special-effects orientated, and the hand to hand combat scenes were slightly clumsy. I don't mind VFX at all, but in BvsS... Even the dark skies in the final fight felt so contrived and forged.Doomsday was badass, but not a moment was utilized to explore him. So, he just turned into noise, CGI and more noise. And some say this is what Man of Steel was meant to be??? Do you remember General Zod? Michael Shannon played the hell out of that role. Then lines like Pete Ross calling Clark; 'Dick splash' (funny), and Lois to Clark; 'Welcome to The Planet' (witty). Then there's the scene of Jonathan Kent's death (intense)... I'm sorry, but that movie, was done Justice.And didn't Lex say: 'The greatest gladiator match in the history of the world'?! Well, Batman and Superman's face off... Boring. After all these years, waiting to see 2 of the most iconic heroes have a go at each other for the 1st time, made you wish it was the last. Sorry Lex/Jesse Eisenberg, even with your very impressive performance, like us, you were let down.Lois Lane... Huh, she was necessary, but then somewhere in the movie, she became useless.I feel like I could go on for a while trashing, what was otherwise an enjoyable movie... So let me end with this; Batman vs Superman was, fun but disappointing. Incomplete but... Nah, no 'but's' there, it was incomplete.P.S. Lawrence Fishburne, good job, and Hans Zimmer, you brought it.",6,2,5,26 March 2016
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," What Happens in Barcelona, Stays...
","Two things I wasn't aware of coming into this film; 1. That Penelope Cruz won an Oscar for her role and 2. That this movie was directed by Woody Allen. These are also important factors I wasn't aware of, while rating the movie in its entirety. The reason that matters, at least for me is that, the lack of that knowledge purged all bias and left only, pure and honest opinion.I'm not a Woody Allen fan at all, and I rated this film 6/10 not knowing it was directed by him, which showed me that yeah, I'm actually, not all that fond of Woody Allen's films.However, as for Penelope Cruz, I found her incredibly stunning in this movie. She embodied the character almost as if it were her own experiences. Without knowing she won an Oscar for this role, I find it now, as no surprise that she did.Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson played their parts wonderfully also.I did find the film a bit predictable perhaps, though some parts, Woody took a path I didn't expect, perhaps because I didn't quite agree with it; like Vicky seemingly feeling no remorse for what she did, but felt ambivalence rather. Also, if it weren't for Penelope's performance, this film would've lost me some 40 minutes in, even with Scarlett.All in all, it was an interesting take on love and relationships... And at points, one couldn't help but envy Juan Antonio; the man had a good thing going, but on a serious note, Maria Elena gave the relationship a substance not known to man. 6/10.",6,0,1,15 April 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The War is Salvaged: Episode VII
","A deserved Billion Dollar movie? Absolutely not. A deserved Record Breaking movie? Again, not a chance.I'm a fan of J.J. Abrams. The man knows how to orchestrate all the constituents of motion picture into an harmonic rapture, but quite honestly - with all due respect, I'm tired of Star Wars succeeding over some (for me) - inexplicable pop/cultural phenomenon.I don't know much at all, about the original three (A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi), but I do know the prequels. The original three may have been out of this world perhaps, and especially for their time, but I can't imagine them being so good, as to survive the joy slurping onslaught that are the prequels.The Force Awakens is a good movie. I enjoyed it. The cinematography was excellent. The leads, though their connection felt rushed, won me over... But, this movie is NOT at all, what it has been made out to be.The story itself feels, hasty. Rey, moves from nothing, to controlling The Force like a pro, to going toe to toe with Ren at damn near a drop of a hat, when Ren is someone who actually is supposed to be on another level with the Force... Really?! And Finn... Being the master of your own destiny as a Storm Trooper should surely, be slightly more difficult?! The Light Saber fights were incredibly unimaginative and bland. The finale, ah, I don't know... It moved from seeming like a daunting task, to a doable rodeo.I'll reiterate, The Force Awakens, is a good movie, but, I personally, do not understand all the success that has come with it.Certainly not a 9.5/10, or 8.5 for that matter, but a 7... That, I can live with.The Star Wars franchise, at least from 1999 to now, could've been amazing... But, it was far from it, and like The Twilight Saga, survived on an inexcusable emotional connection propelled by, a new hope.",6,3,13,2 January 2016
Flight," Bottled Up Emotions.
","Alcoholism is a very weird disease. To be so dependent on it, that just by looking at it, you fully mutate to a point of throwing your entire life away, for no rhyme or reason... If alcoholism wasn't a real thing, this movie would've been on very shaky ground, but it is, and Flight caught it quite lucidly.Denzel was amazing, he really was, and the supporting cast did so not only as the characters they were playing in the film, but also as actors who have mastered their crafts.Alan Silvestri and Robert Zemeckis are a captivating duo... Like Darabont and Newman, or Cameron and Horner. When they come together, it's almost guaranteed, there is no place your emotions can hide.Flight was a well told story, admirable and satisfactory. 7.3/10.",7,1,1,19 August 2017
The Purge," Purge the Writer.
","I was expecting something exciting, given how interesting of a concept this film holds; rather, all I got was an annoying, irritatingly irritating... I'll say it again, irritatingly irritating and unnecessary story that tries to combat morals and fails so dismally you can't even enjoy this infuriating muck.The Daughter - Zoey (With her persistent schoolgirl outfit): She deserves to be purged. Why? She has this anger towards her father, that we later realize is because her father, James, has forbidden her to be with her boyfriend because he is older. Nowhere in this film are we given the opportunity to care about Zoey or her dumb relationship. Sure, it's not her fault that her boyfriend snuck in, but it is her fault that he (the boyfriend) got introduced into the life of the character we actually cared about, being James.The Son - Charlie: Oh my goodness! I hated him from the minute he was introduced. Spying on your mother with a creepy doll on a day such as The Purge. That automatically starts him off on a bad footing, then he goes and does what he did. EVERYTHING was his fault, but not once was he even ever blamed. I hate the character so much, I actually don't want to see Max Burkholder in any other movie, otherwise I may just 'release the beast'.Charlie was NOT a hero in any way, shape or form. He is an idiotic, useless piece of anything coward, that actively endangered the lives of ALL his family members and kept restricting the endangerment of his own... And for what??! This wasn't a moral conundrum. This brainless fool of a kid let his own sister make her way into the very danger he orchestrated. Even turning the homeless man into a hero does not save this half-wit little punk, because ALL that happened, could've been avoided had he just played his part... And if he wanted to be a hero, then, he should've endangered his life, and his life alone.Then we have the community trying to kill the very family that's providing them with all the security they need to stay alive, because the Sandins made money from it??! What the hell motivation is that??? OK, we kill them, then what happens next year? Will they be exposed, or will somebody else make money off their unprotected behinds???From there, James Sandin earned the viewers favour, and Mary Sandin did her bit to not be too annoying, and I appreciate that. The cinematography was polished, however, because of how senseless the story is, any attempt at startling and terrifying, fell on its own blade.2.4/10 for this squandered opportunity and unnecessary mess.",2,15,19,25 November 2016
Deadpool," Alive and Kicking Pool
","This movie is inspired. From the director, to the writers (The Real Hero's indeed), to the stars - everyone played their position to the tee.This movie for me, is not awesome because it depicted a road arguably never taken before... It's awesome because it took a route that should not be mirrored ever.The love story was made butch via cursing, boobs and mad action, all at the right tempo and portions, yet still at the heart of it all, the love was marshmallow like; sweet, soft and pink.The humour, quite honestly, was witty, keen, acute and executed with the same precision as the 'final shot kill three simultaneously' skill Deadpool achieved. The budget was so well handled... Even if Xavier's school dwindled to just 2 students. Also, Morena Baccarin was sooooo hot... Like truly though... Ohhh my... She really was the Hot Chick.This movie deserves an 8/10, definitely, but not because of it's plot or depth; rather because of its execution, however I hope, through the possible misconception of the masses, that it doesn't detriment or diminish the 'Super-Hero' age. Deadpool did what it did incredibly well; The satire, mockery, indifference... But, I'm still a fan of intense drama, sci-fi action thriller. Without question, I still prefer; The Cap: 'Tony, you know I wouldn't do this if I had any other choice, but he's my friend'. Iron Man: 'So was I'!Deadpool earned its right to be what it is... I just hope, it doesn't pollute the rest of the pool.Also... Gina Carano was also hot...#CivilWar #Apocalypse #DoctorStrange #DawnOfJustice #SuicideSquad.",8,3,13,13 February 2016
The Cabin in the Woods," The Hunger Games: Feeding Gods.
","Why did that technician (Richard Jenkins) say to Dana; 'It's you', and who was he asking her to kill? Surly he's not talking about the 'he' attached to that massive hand. What makes Cabin In The Woods fresh, is just how it juxtaposed the mayhem with the habitual day-to-day, even though this particular day-to-day is pretty, unpretty.Somehow, going from just 5 normal millennials on their way to an enjoyable getaway from the city, to gods, magic, zombies and the world ending, felt as seamless as a jump like that can be, I suppose. In 1 hour, Cabin In The Woods did what The Fast and Furious franchise needed 15 years to accomplish, (Dom and team going from stealing appliances, to saving the world and stopping 'World War III') and it's still arguable if whether or not it was accomplished plausibly.I also feel like this movie was giving major nods to a plethora of age old monsters and demons, and that felt like an awesome touch. The elevator scene seriously made me wish that 1; This film had a bigger budget, because all those monstrosities coming together like that was just, so much fun and 2. Yeah, that this film was part of a multiverse (I guess we are in that 'age' now, and Joss assisted in creating monsters like us).Towards the end however, the film started falling a little flat, and becoming less charming. Events started feeling too coincidental in too many a consecutive sequence, but seeing killer unicorns was pretty cool; all that was missing was the deadliest monster of all, Cupid. 7/10.P.S. Chris Hemsworth's American accent is abysmal. I still like him though, but seriously, it's terrible.",7,2,2,21 April 2018
Joy," A Messy Life, So, She Mopped the Floor.
","'...it is equally possible that she is a fatally flawed underachiever, doomed to a lifetime of failure, disappointment, unfulfilled expectations'.I get why this movie has a 60% rating from audience and critics alike, however, something too great to ignore resonated with me, amid the film's irregularities and foolishness. Lines like the one above, in conjunction with it's somewhat uncommon approach, somehow melded well with me, and spoke to me.Yeah sure, there are things in this movie that just have you questioning, how or why; like Todd's mistake on live television. Why and how do you go on live television to sell a product you aren't as familiar with as you should be, then as a professional TV personality, handle that situation so appallingly? Trudy, poor, poor Trudy. It was just supposed to be a date with the old man. However, within all these 'whys', I felt myself also asking; Why not?!Perhaps if this film wasn't based on true events, it would seem a bit too far fetched and disingenuous, but it was. True, being a bio is no licence to warp reality, but personally, I feel Joy captured enough actual real life realism and chaos, while not losing sight of the entertainment factor, and still remaining adequately inspirational enough, to warrant at least a messy 7.8/10...But, that is what the mop was made for; to absorb the mess, and expose the cleanliness buried underneath. Joy's life was a mess, so she mopped the floor clean with competition.",8,5,11,10 June 2017
Warcraft," No Craft in this War.
","This is a terrible movie, that's also incredibly messy and made little sense while choking on its own umbilical cord. Warcraft is all over the place. It has no focus, and its story suffers greatly from a sequence of events that come together about as well as dipping sushi in ketchup.Maybe fans of the Warcraft game understood what the hell was going on in this film, but the rest of us were wondering 'WTF' during 'WTB' (Warcraft: The Beginning). The character developments were also ridiculously flat. The relationships had absolutely no life; Anduin and his son. Anduin and Garona. The king ad his queen. Anduin and his sister. Anduin and the king. This list of these half to barely developed run-of-the-mill characters and more so, relationships, could really span almost, if not the entire cast.The CGI started off okay to good, then of course as the movie progressed, the intensity and necessity of the visual effects grew, and unfortunately, grew beyond the films budget and/or the director's ability to create the world he needed to. Warcraft was CGI heavy, extremely so, and that made it run the risk of starting to feel cartoonish, unrealistic, and even worse, fake. The Green Screens are so obvious, especially at the end when the Guardian to be guy was handing a sword to Anduin, amongst many other parts in this film.The fight sequences were meh. The acting was meh. The composition was meh. The directing and cinematography, meh. Visual effects, meh. The editing... Meh. 4.4/10.",4,1,4,26 March 2018
The Great Gatsby," A Great Movie, Old Sport
","'It's so sad, because it's so hard to make her understand. It's so hard to make her understand. I've gotten all these things for her. I've gotten all these things for her and now she just... she just wants to run away'.That quote, is what this movie is about. Her (Daisy Buchanan) Fear vs his (Jay Gatsby) Hope. This movie is, an amazing, and tragic love story.And the tragedy, is not, Gatsby's death... That rather, was his salvation. The tragedy, was his, outburst. 'Non of this, is of any consequence', and that statement from him, was in fact, true. The tragedy is that; In one INCREDIBLY understandable moment, Gatsby lost everything, and she didn't even realize it. She couldn't see that she was being manipulated, and he, couldn't show her. The less he spoke, the more she faded away... Yet still, the more he'd speak, the faster, she'd become a memory.And what's amazing, is how Baz portrayed the turn of events. A tantrum... Something that seems so simple and instantly forgivable, can turn your whole world upside down. For 5 years, Gatsby worked on an incorruptible idea, however the only perfect piece about it, being Daisy, couldn't realize a simple truth... That, that can amplify frustration to immense proportions... Especially, when you've spent so long, and so much effort, to keep that frustration locked away, so far deep inside you forget it's there, just for it to spring up on you, and create the disaster you always knew it would.Destroy hope... And you destroy purpose... And without purpose, you're, without.This movie is borderline a nine... Leonardo was, captivating, and Carey Mulligan, even though you gradually abhor her character, Daisy, to the point of absolute disgust... Her delivery was wonderful. And Tobey was a welcomed addition.Gatsby? No... The Great Gatsby.",8,0,1,9 June 2016
Sully," A Sullied NTSB.
","When Captain Sullenberger delivered his speech, during the 'hearing', a speech which by the way was so tranquil and true, the NTSB's reaction was of defeat, as if their role is to convict, rather than find what is the truth. Either that area of the movie was directed badly, misrepresented by this film or, the NTSB is 100% unethical. Which ever reason it may be, sadly for me, it took away from the movie.Dr. Elizabeth Davis's apology meant little, to nothing at all. That entire panel seemed as if they were just 'caught out/caught red handed' when Sully delivered his rationale, almost suggesting that, that piece of knowledge Sully brought to light, they already knew, but were hoping would fly under the radar, so they could condemn an innocent man... And because this is based on true events, it makes it especially disgusting to fathom.Beyond that, Sully is a good movie, just, good. The direction, photography, acting and score, just good all around... Nothing really stood out, but everything came together in a, good way. 6.5/10.",6,0,1,25 August 2017
Alien: Covenant," A New (B)earth, In A Familiar Womb.
","The crew that landed on the Earth-like planet were both careless and callous. They requested and encouraged the crew still left on the Covenant, to descend into territory of which who's dangers they were fully aware of, and allowed for thousands of lives to be put at risk, so theirs could be saved.That however, didn't necessarily diminish my enjoyment of this movie, as it was really a mixed bag of the same old tired repetition of the Alien franchise formula and stalled structure, with a dash of something new in the form of knowing who exactly, and in fact, created the aliens, but, there was some major 'bad' in that revelation.Prometheus gave the impression that it was the origin point of the aliens, including the planet they were on, and that those aliens were created by the superior human race, just to find that nope, both the planet and the 'superiors' were just some kind of filler.Also, the exciting story is experiencing Shaw's journey into encountering this new race and its planet, however, we were robbed of this story, where David being the creator would've then worked as an exciting twist. Sadly, because of the lack of proper story progression, the David twist ended up being annoyingly predictable and monotonous.Characteristically, Alien: Covenant is a lot like 1986's Aliens, so personally, I wouldn't understand how anyone who praised Cameron's work then, would find major fault in Scott's work here.The idea is still amazing. 'God' creates man. Man creates android. Android creates alien. Alien kills android's god, and its gods' god, for its own god; a covenant. Absolutely, a story too exciting, but sadly, handled with heavy hands. The Alien franchise could've rotated around the sun, instead, it merely rotated around its own axis. 6.3/10.P.S. What exactly is going on, on Earth? What does Earth look like in this franchise? Does it look like how it does at the end of Resurrection, or does it not? If it does, why? What happened? Is the 'terraforming' just an innovation, or is it a desperate necessity?",6,1,3,13 May 2018
The Martian," Martian, to Space Pirate, to Iron Man.
","Some awesome one liners, steady pace, satisfactory direction, good scoring and a wonderful cast, The Martian is an entertaining space odyssey that does a fine job at making it's viewer feel the isolation Mark is going through, which is an important part of the story - however, I do feel that it could've still been done better.All that Mark accomplished, though at many points seemed amazing, at other parts it seemed a little too easy, especially his journey to the MAV, but again, overall, his struggle, panic and isolation was well captured for the most part.Some characters were a little too under used, and other characters perhaps felt kind of useless or rather, not too necessary, but on the flip side, it felt like an accurate depiction of how it actually is, and realism in this type of film, is always a good thing, because the intent is to be more than just entertainment if possible... If possible, the intent is, possibility.The Martian is more than a 7, but less than an 8, so a 7.5/10 it'll be from me, for the fastest space pirate in the history of space travel... in a convertible.",7,0,0,9 April 2017
Law Abiding Citizen," 96% Conviction Rate. 4% Justice.
","The notion of justice being based on 'Left or RIGHT', and not 'RIGHT and wrong', is not a flaw based on Justice, it's a flaw based on Humans. This is why, I love this movie. 'People need to be accountable for their actions'.The justice system changed Nick, when he was supposed to change and better the system, and throughout the entire movie, he failed to see this, until he threatened Clyde by saying; 'If you touch my family'... Then straight after that, he was blind again. Clyde wasn't an enemy, nor was he a psycho. Clyde was Nick... Clyde was the very system that wanted to stop him... The difference is, Clyde didn't break the system, the already broken system, broke him... And now, they wanted to judge him for exactly what they are. And how did they end up doing it, by turning into Clyde... But who's going to judge them?And Clyde's rampage, wasn't the proof of his brokenness, that all was to make a point. Clyde's turning point, was when he killed his cellmate. That, for me, was the epitome of what the justice system did to him.And the ending... For me, it can remain as it is, with just 1 simple adjustment... I would've preferred for Clyde to have been aware, before he hit the call button, that he was calling his own destiny. That way, the system knows it didn't win, it knows that it lost, the moment Clyde lost his family.I give this movie an 8, because it engaged the hell out of me... It's relevant, and close to any heart that has had to deal with, Left vs RIGHT, and not, RIGHT vs wrong.",8,0,0,16 June 2016
