Resident Evil: Afterlife," Final Nail in the Resident Evil Coffin
","Resident Evil - Gave its in game routes an honourable mention.Resident Evil:Apocalypse - Returned full force bringing the excitement Resident Evil 3 to the big screen.Resident Evil:Extinction - Brought suspension of disbelief to scary new levels.Resident Evil:Afterlife - The fun stops here.After watching the latest installment in the now name only Resident Evil movie franchise, I can make one safe assumption.Paul Anderson no longer cares.Relying on a son, nephew or young game playing male influence for research, a book of every zombie movie clich√© nearby and a malevolent grin while sat behind his type writer knowing a gullible cash ready audience awaits he has penned the latest travesty in his movie credit library.Plot wise the movie has none. There's a loose and random weave about survivors looking for hope in a world now long beyond saving who through a variety of convenient plot points find themselves in peril repeatedly.As if the unanswered questions from the third installment still going unanswered wasn't enough - We have yet more fuel for the fire with 'WTF' moments, random slow motion (designed no doubt to build tension in moments that are already laughable!) and scenes installed to wow the crowds who forked out the extra for the 3D seats.The return of a few old characters and introduction of new, doesn't really help the plot go anywhere. The extra characters are with us so briefly that we aren't given anytime to care whether they live or die. In fact the returning heroins characters development stalls at the opening credits and by the end of the movie I didn't care if Milla survived or not.Borrowing far to heavily from Resident Evil 5, villains, characters, scene for scene remakes proves how lazy the movie writers have actually become. Unexplainable situations arise if only to insert a game moment that will have 12 years old jumping up and down with excitement. The movie itself carries a 15 certificate which seems highly inflated since its target audience is in fact the 12 year old life blood that keeps movies like this alive.The same 12 year olds who littered the front row at the cinema will be glad to know the unavoidable cash hungry sequel will be on our screens in 2015 apparently - Leaving just enough time for Capcom to pen the game sequel Anderson can rip off to use as the basis of Resident Evil:Retribution.I'm a long time fan of the Resident Evil series, just because I'm 28 doesn't mean I cant enjoy what is clearly a popcorn movie. What I don't enjoy is seeing what had serious potential reduced to laughable proportions epic in scale.Sitting opposite Skyline as one of the worst movies this decade, Resident Evil:Afterlife proves that Milla will never live up to her potential as an actress, Paul Anderson will never win an Oscar and that a successful game to movie transition remains just out of reach again.",1,2,5,11 September 2011
