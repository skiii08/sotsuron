Moneyball," It's Not A Basebal Movie; It's A Michael Lewis Movie
","Judging from some of the reviews, many viewers did not get this movie. It isn't a movie about baseball any more than 'Treasure of the Sierra Madre' is a movie about gold mining. The baseball is just a canvas that Michael Lewis used to paint his familiar themes that he has more commonly expressed in stories about Wall Street.Anyone who has read Michael Lewis's other books, 'Liar's Poker' and especially 'The Big Short' and who has seen his extraordinary 2012 Yale commencement on Youtube address will have found the same themes running throughout his work; that people are often mis-valued because of luck and circumstances outside their control; that people are too easily fooled by appearances; that 'convention wisdom' is often no wisdom at all; that it takes an outsider to see through the arbitrariness of 'conventional wisdom; that the outsider going against the tide will be ignored or treated as a fool; that it takes an unusual person driven by some personal flaw or demon to stand apart from the unthinking mob and to persevere against the opposition. It is this last theme that is the real focus of his work what makes his stories so compelling.The story of Bill Beane personifies all these themes. He is another version of the oddball lot in the 'Big Short', Mike Burry, Steve Eisman and the Boys from Cornwall capital who saw through the facade of the big Wall Street Banks went all in against them, and even the story of Lewis himself, who walked away from a sure multi-million dollar Wall Street career because he thought that it was all nonsense and would rather find a new 'senior thesis.' Billy Beane is another oddball outsider with the character flaw. Billy was a great high school talent, 6-4 the perfect picture of a baseball player. but was missing something that kept him from being the star that he was supposed to be. (The book explains much more of this when contrasting him with Lenny Dykstra, a small, 13th round draft pick who managed to make it big). At age 30, when still in his prime as major league player, albeit a fringe one, he quit and asked for a job at a scout, shocking just about every one from players to management. What character flaw leads a person to trade the wealth and fame of playing in the majors, the dream of players, fans and management, to become a bush league scout? It's easy to see why Lewis fell in love with the story.Billy knows that appearances deceive because, after all, he was the perfect example. He was everything a star player was supposed to be in the eyes of the scouts - except he wasn't. He has suspicions about conventional baseball wisdom, but he himself has been baseball too long to completely come free of them. Then he meets a real outsider, Peter Brand, a Yale economics major who never played baseball and doesn't look like he ever could. Brand confirms Beane's misgivings about traditional wisdom when he explains precisely why appearances are so often wrong and why scouts and their conventional wisdom are based on a superficial understanding of what matters in winning. It all boils down to what Beane later describes as 'selling jeans' - finding the right body, even the right face. Judging by appearances and ignoring real performance. Better yet, Brandt offers an alternative, using one of Lewis's other themes, they players are often mis-valued because of luck or other irrelevant circumstances, they pitch funny or they hang out at strip clubs, etc. Beane buys in, partly because of necessity and partly it confirms his suspicions. He not only selects players based on Brandt's ideas, over the vehement objects of old guard scouts, but he also goes so far as choosing a new head scout precisely because the man never played baseball and was untainted by conventional wisdom.Then comes the next phases of Lewis's storyline, the scorn, laughter, and conflict with the insiders who see their position and self worth being questioned. Finally, there is eventual, if not complete, vindication. This leads to the film ending in two wonderful scenes. The Jeremy Brown video scene and his daughter's song both captured the spirit and the message of the film in a graceful ways.In sum, it's a very nice movie of ideas. It certainly isn't about baseball. It's about how our view of the world and our judgment of other people and even ourselves is so often based on the wrong things, the surface things.Note added: Most of the ideas that Beane used to select players in the movie had been learned from his predecessor as GM, Sandy Alderson, who is never mentioned in the movie. Alderson got them from reading Bill James, the godfather of the new statistical analysis who was contemptuous of standard baseball thinking. He wrote some really interesting and philosophical books on the subject of statistics and baseball while working as a night security guard at a pork and bean factory. He is also mentioned once, although Peter Brand is presumably meant to represent James+Paul DePodesta.",9,0,1,1 December 2012
Miracle," OK, but nothing special
","It was another Cinderella sports story, the same kind that we've seen a zillion times before. It may have been better than most, but that doesn't change the cookie-cutter feel.One jarring note, however, was the choice of Noah Emmerich as Craig Patrick. After taking so much trouble to have Kurt Russell look and act some much like Herb Brooks, why did they go out a pick Noah Emmerich to play Craig Patrick? Emmerich looks and acts nothing like Craig Patrick. It is jarring to see the plump guy with lots of hair playing a thin guy with no hair. It really was an irritation through the movie. The director said that Emmerich was a friend of his, so that's obviously the reason. Too bad he picked friendship over making the best possible movie.The best actor in the movie was the guy who played Mikhailov. His smirk when he first lined up against the US team was absolutely priceless.",6,0,4,2 July 2005
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Oldman Terrible In Dismal Movie
","Why do producers do remakes of excellent previous movies? All they can do is screw it up. TTSS is another example. It is a very dismal version of the much better series. I mean dismal literally, in like the photography is dark and grainy. Like most remakes, they simply don't understand what made the original so effective.I knew it would be bad when I heard that Gary Oldman would play George Smiley. And I was right. Oldman is completely wrong for the part. George Smiley is an tired-looking, older , overweight man who looks as harmless as a fly, all the while disguising his razor mind. Oldman looks like trim 50 year old business man. The script doesn't help him since he has barely a word to say and Oldman simply isn't a good enough actor to communicate with the audience nonverbally through gesture and attitude.The movie also has virtually no character development. You never learn a thing about any of the 5 possible spys. Connie Sachs has been almost completely written out of the story. There are huge gaps in the story. Prideaux is shot and assumed dead. He then reappears with no explanation, until much later. The movie shift back and forth in time with no warning and it is often hard to tell which time period is being portrayed. I'm sure some people think this artsy. I just found it confusing.The biggest problem with the movies it it misses the point of the original. This is a story about betrayal: a man betrays his country and also his best friend. Which betrayal is greater? In the original, it's the personal betrayal that carries the power and moves the viewer. This remake so completely misses this that the key relationship in the story between Prideaux and Haydon is barley mentioned.In sum, this movie is two hours of empty atmosphere. It doesn't understand whst the story is really about. It haspoorly developed characters, almost no story with large gaps, and a very weak ending compared to the way it plays out in the original series and book.",3,2,5,18 November 2012
Silver Linings Playbook," Proof That Ratings Are Meaningless
","You instantly know that you are in trouble when the lead characters bond during discussion of psychotropic meds that they've been taking for their various mental disturbances. This is a new low in cute-meet, rom-coms. Since the main characters don't supply enough psychosis, there is the father with OCD for good measure. Maybe other people find mentally disturbed, erratic and violent characters a cute, but I don't. It is hard to pinpoint whether Bradley Cooper's dreadful acting excesses were due to his lack of talent or, heaven-forbid, were exactly what the director wanted. In either case, I wanted to reach through the screen, grab him by the neck and tell him to shut up. As if this wasn't annoying enough, there was Robert De Niro's as his father to add two more forms of mental disturbance. He is an Eagle's fan and has OCD. Which is the worse mental illness is debatable, but enough is enough. There is hardly a quiet sane moment in the film. De Niro, by far the most overrated actor of the last 40 years, is his usual grumbling self. Since he said 'This is this' in the Deer Hunter in 1978, he has been said every single line exactly the same. Jennifer Lawrence was the least annoying character, but she had her moments.You can't help wonder why such a movie as bad as this gets such positive reviews. There is a apparently a large, devoted audience for maudlin, feel-good romances involving annoying people. As long as the couple ends up together, that seems to be all that matters. Steal a subplot from 'Shall We Dance' for good measure and, voil√† la, we have a winner. There must be a strong self selection process in who goes to see such movies. The people who chose to see them are the kind of people to whom such sentimental trash appeals, so they are naturally likely to give it a good review. I saw it on an airplane for free because there nothing else but 'blow em up' action and scifi movies and kid's stuff. Next time, I'll take a good book.",1,6,12,2 September 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Better Than Expected
","After seeing Hollywood massacre Tinker , Tailor, last night, my expectations were very low going into another remake. However, this was a much better effort. Taken in its own right, the Hollywood version of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is a pretty good thriller - until the last 25 minutes, which where clearly tacked on to pave the way for the next installment. Still, the story moved along with a nice brisk pace. Sometimes too brisk. The other obvious problem is the failure to make the tangled Vanger family tree clear. Most of the time, I had no idea how the various family members were related. It was very confusing.As Hollywood remakes go, it was good try. But they just could help selling out. I guess they assume that the US public couldn't take someone as edgy and threatening to middle class values as the original Salander. Compared to original version, the movie suffers badly because Hollywood took a lot of the edges off Lisabeth Salander. They kept most of the surface features, but underneath she was a very different character than the Lisabeth from the original. In the original, she was clearly a hacker. In the Hollywood version, she portrayed more socially acceptably as a researcher, who, by the way, could get around computer security. This was minor compared to the character transformation. The only shot of her in the spiked hair is in the beginning of the Hollywood, in what you might call a half spike. You never see the full Lisabeth punk look. They completely gilded her menace, and most of all, her strength, independence and her 'I don't care' attitude. The final scene was 100% contrary her nature in the original. It was a classic Hollywood sell out. They just couldn't handle the Lisabeth from the original.Part of the problem was Rooney Mara, who seemed like a nice girl from the suburbs in a costume and not a like a feral survivor who would set her father on fire and extract violent revenge on whoever crossed her. Try as she could, she just wasn't believable when she says 'I'm crazy.' Her features are too regular. She looks too normal. In contrast, Noomi Repace has those angular features that make her look like she's ready to taser you any moment.",7,0,2,25 November 2012
To Rome With Love," Beyond simply bad - it's irritating
","Hope springs eternal. You see his name on a movie. You think back nostalgically to 'Annie Hall'. You ignore how much you hated his last movie. You try to be optimistic that this will be better. You think the movie can't be worse than the last. But it always is. Woody Allen becomes more irritating with each new movie: the bumbling persona that hasn't been funny for 25 years , the pretentiousness, the pseudo-intellectual fantasy mumbo jumbo, etc etc. wore out their welcome long ago. And yet he persists in making yet another version of the last movie he made. He never grows. He never changes.I've reprogrammed by DVD zip control. I now have to fast, very fast, extra fast and Woody Allen movie. Next time I'll e prepared.I gave 1 point for the shots of Rome. The rest is a dead loss.",1,6,11,6 November 2013
