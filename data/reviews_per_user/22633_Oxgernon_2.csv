The Blair Witch Project," One of the worst movies ever
","This is possibly one of the worst movies I've seen in my life (and I've seen quite a few bad movies). Why? First of all, because although it's advertised as a horror movie, it's not scary at all. Okay, I really doesn't scare easily, but what's wrong with this movie is that all of the characters are so annoying, that after less than half an hour you're just looking forward to see them get killed in some bizarre way. And while hoping for this to happen may be slightly exciting, it's certainly not scary. Second, I don't like the hand-held low-quality cams, but that's just me. So, the final thought: If you haven't seen this movie yet, don't. Ever.",1,9,16,10 February 2002
A Clockwork Orange," My all-time favorite movie
","This movie is simply excellent, as are all of Kubrick's movies. The characters, the story, the background music, the setting, everything about this movie, really, are great - and the atmosphere created by the mentioned factors are undescribable. And, of course, Malcolm McDowell's performance as the crazed teenager, Alexander de Large, is beautiful. I really can't say anything bad about this movie. It's the ultimate visual experience. My recommendation: If you haven't seen this movie yet, make sure to see it as soon as possible. And if you have seen this movie, it surely wouldn't hurt you to see it again!",10,0,0,10 February 2002
