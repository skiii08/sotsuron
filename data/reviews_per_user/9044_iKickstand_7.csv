Lucky Number Slevin," Not as bad as some say...
","I think this film has got some rather harsh reviews from some sources, claiming it is not as clever as it thinks it is and so on. I've also heard it being compared to the similar film of last year revolver, but I haven't seen this one yet so I cant comment on this.I saw this movie last week, and I must say cant really remember a lot of it (which isn't really a good sign). What I can remember is the cast performances were actually quite good. John Hartnett made a good job of keeping the main character funny and interesting. Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley both played their crime boss parts well. If nothing else, Lucy Lui is very nice to look at, and although it was obviously not his best performance ever, Bruce Willis did a good job of playing a world class assassin who is more involved in the stories events then you might first think.I cant really remember anything at all about the soundtrack, editing or direction apart from the fact there was nothing we really haven't seen before, as most of the films appeal lies in the cast and complex plot.I think Lucky Number Slevin is just another case of a decent crime-mystery thriller which we have seen pulled off in better ways before. You could certainly find worse ways of spending a few hours, and make no mistake, this film is a lot better then most Hollywood action-thrillers that spoon feed the plot to you, and leave you to just turn your brain off.If you really want to see a perfectly crafted crime thriller that will have you guessing the plot till the end, you may want to rather watch something like L.A Confidential, or the brilliant Usual Suspects. But if you like the look of this film, don't listen to a lot of the critical abuse it has been getting, and give it a go. You might be pleasantly surprised.",6,7,19,11 March 2006
Hot Fuzz," First a Rom-Zom-Com, now an action-comedy?
","I saw this film last night at a preview screening at the vue cinema in Romford.I must admit I was a little worried about the movie, during the first 10 minutes. There are surprisingly few laughs at the start of the film which may put some people off or cause people to expect the worst. Thankfully it does pick up soon enough though.Being a fan of Simon's, Nicks and Edgars previous work, it is impossible to not compare this to Shaun or Spaced. And although Fuzz only really shines in the second half, and I don't feel this film had as many quotable one-lines as SOTD, it does have very funny parts. Nick Frost is great as usual, and plays a very different & unique character then Ed or Mike. I did feel Pegg's character was maybe a bit too serious though, as most of the comedy was left to the village supporting characters (played by a lot of Britain's comedy stars).I think the biggest surprise was how good the action element was in the last section of the film. It really was as good as any other action film around these days, and left me wondering if Hot Fuzz was intended to primarily be an action or comedy film.One word of warning for anyone young planning on seeing the movie: some of the murder scenes are a bit gruesome. But nothing worse then in shaun.Overall a very good British comedy film,, and nice follow up to Shaun of the dead. I would gladly go again Now I just wish the guys would get on with spaced series 3!",7,2,5,6 February 2007
Ex Machina," Thrilling, tense, scary and though provoking
","I love Artificial Intelligence films. 'Blade Runner', 'A.I' and 'The Terminator' are among some of my favourite Sci-Fi movies so I was naturally looking forward to Ex Machina as soon as I saw the trailer. It didn't let me down.I love the feel of this movie. Everything in Nathan's housing complex seems so clean, polished and state of the art yet the confined, remote setting makes you feel claustrophobic and helpless when things start going wrong. Despite all the advanced technology we are introduced to though, it doesn't feel too optimistic or far off into the long-term future, like a more civilised version of 'Children of Men'. The film centers around four main characters which is just enough to keep things tightly focused but also keep you guessing everybody's motives throughout the running time. The performances by Oscar Isaac (who I am sure everyone is familiar with now) and Alicia Vikander are especially great with Alicia embodying the intelligent android 'Ava' brilliantly.The film says a lot about what it means to create an artificial life with personality in this quickly evolving world that we are living in. With mobile companions like 'Siri' or 'Cortana' now commonplace in our pockets, I feel this is a better time than ever to watch and discuss what these advancements will mean for the human race in ten to twenty years, and provides a good companion peace to 'Her' released at the same time last year.The last fifteen minutes are exciting, tense, slightly horrifying and will leave you with mixed emotions about each character and how they behaved. For me, it's already a top contender for film of 2015. Catch it on theaters or on Blu-Ray as soon as you can.",9,6,20,16 March 2015
Frank," I love you all
",'Frank' was great. Ginger lad from Ex Machina joins Jake Gyllenhaal's sister (Yoko Ono)'s avant-garde band. They spend time recording in Ireland before heading to the states to perform live for their masses of fans at the SXSW festival. Picks up especially to the end building up to their final performance where we see band life isn't all sunshine and rainbows.You will feel inspired to go make some crazy music or walk out the house in just a dressing gown and some flippers as this movie cheers for the unique and strangely creative creature inside all of us. Recommended - as long as you're looking for something different.,7,1,2,16 March 2015
The Departed," Violence, Language & maybe a bit over-clever
","I will start by saying if you are not a fan of very strong violence or very strong language, you should probably steer clear of this one. If you have seen any Scorsese movie before, you should know what to expect, but be warned this should be able to give goodfellas a run for its money on the cold blooded killings and swearing front.I did like this movie a lot, but did have a hard time keeping up with it at times. There is A lot of people being undercover, switching sides and generally lieing to each other as to who's side they are on. Luckily it didn't get to the point of trying to be too over-clever (see oceans 12) but at times it was trying, and I feel the average viewer would have a hard time keeping up with this story.Jack Nocholsons character reminded me a lot of Ben Kingsley's in Sexy Beast. A very intimidating and unpredictable man, who uses extreme violence and language on an everyday basis. And even though they both did not have much screen time (compared to some other major characters)I think everyone will agree they were both the best thing about both of these films.Throughout watching this film, I couldn't help think it reminded me a lot of Michael Mann's action-drama 'Heat'. Both films used a lot of character development to make the shootout scenes that much more rewarding. Both used a mix of mellow and tense music to add extra depth to the scenes, and both used the entire first three quarters of the movie just as a warm up for the end when all the action took place, and you finally figured everything out.I'm sure a lot of people will like the final 20 minutes a lot, I felt a bit like as there was so much time spent on developing thee plot and characters, Marty felt as though there wasn't much else left to do so just decided to kill everyone off. But I guess this was the way it turned out in the original, so I cant comment on that.Overall I liked this film a lot. I think it should have maybe ended about 10 minutes earlier, as at one point near the very end I thought to myself 'Most of the characters are gone, what is left to do'? I'm still deciding if it was my favourite of the year so far, but after 6 months or so waiting for the release, I think I can safely say I was not disappointed.",8,0,5,6 October 2006
Zero Dark Thirty," Great searching-for-someone thriller. Especially picks up during last hour
","I read that the original script was written about the decade long search and failed manhunt of Osama Bin Laden but was completely re- written months before filming began once American forces had found and killed him. In hindsight, this is really lucky because I felt the film really picked up pace once the Pakistan fortress was introduced and especially during the half hour long night raid. Jessica Chastain gives another great performance as the strong and smart CIA operative who's ten year work was the backbone of finally hunting down the worlds most wanted man. Other roles are played well enough but it really rests on Chastain's shoulders. The movie was released at the perfect time following the true events that took place. I'm glad that they didn't release this a year earlier or I feel it would have felt unfinished ala Zodiac.",8,0,1,16 March 2015
Carrie," Drawn out, irritating and disappointing
","I had been greatly looking forward to watching this one for a long time and after finally doing so I honestly can't see what people like so much about this drawn out, stupid, annoying, wet flannel of a horror film.For an allegedly famously scary movie, it took so long to get to any sort of horror it was a joke. It wouldn't have been so bad if the buildup content was interesting but what we have instead is child-like garbage dialogue from John Travolta and Nancy Allen's characters (along with comedy slap noise and school ground insults - most of this movie felt like a spoof to me ) and a repulsively irritating mother who will definitely prevent me from re-watching the film. Everyone know's what is going to happen at the end by the poster or DVD cover so by the time the slow-mo bucket scene at the prom was dragging along at snail's pace, I was virtually screaming out JUST PULL THE ROPE ALREADY!! Of course the only highlight of the film following this scene (all the destruction/revenge bits) went so quickly compared to the rest of the picture, that I felt robbed.The only savior came at the very last scene, when even when I'd guessed what was coming it still made me jump a little. Truly a below average movie which I'm sure could have been filmed much better had someone else directed the Stephen King story. After seeing so much praise for this, I am very, very disappointed.",2,9,20,14 July 2011
