Iron Man 3," GREAT balance GREAT movie, it gets everything right!
","Iron Man 3 is BEYOND a typical summer movie. It's everything an entertaining movie should be, and much, much more. There's a serious subtext to the story and it leaps out of the very first moments of the film. The brilliant, hard-drinking, fast-talking, now traumatized superhero charms from opening scene until the last.The movie gets everything right but maybe its number one strength is the fact that they cover new and exciting ground. Downey again brings a winning personality to play as Stark; he finds his pathos, too. Don Cheadle certainly has the acting chops to hang with Downey. Ben Kingsley's Mandarin is not what he seems and wonderful. No one, not even the villains are one dimensional characters. Guy Pearce is perfect in his role and, at the end, you can see why he was cast. Gwyneth Paltrow and Rebecca Hall certainly add sex appeal but beyond that they also deliver real performances and truly deep characters. This is Pepper Potts best film by far and is every bit the perfect match for Stark. The interaction and the relationships all work well and are truly a highlight of the entire movie. All the dialog is superb. You would expect nothing less from a Shane Black film. This ranks right up there if not surpasses Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.A lot of superhero comic book movies seem to share a problem in tone. Most films try to cope with wild concepts by emphasizing darkness, even over-emphasizing it. IM3 is somewhat dark but keeps in line with the wonderful tone already established for this character and universe. Again, this movie's creators mix everything so well. It leans towards dark but touches heavily on every other tone and emotion. Maybe it's the character or maybe it's because they had Downey's talents to play with but Downey's performance leads to more clever banter and genuinely real dialog than most other movies have ever delivered, regardless of genre. So much of the humor works because of this and all the dramatic beats really click. Downey's Stark is glib as ever but there's something bubbling under the surface that we haven't seen before. He never loses his likability and grows in to something more than what we've seen. That's true character turn and development in a summer film!!!! What's also rare for any popcorn movie is that every plot turn carries real emotional weight. This is what you get when you mix great acting talent with outstanding material. They make it shine and give you a remarkable summer movie. In terms of action, what we came to expect in Avengers is delivered here as well. Iron Man kicks butt again and again, he's not alone. The CG is perfect and the action is intense and very well done. That's no shocker.What was a pleasant surprise was that Iron Man 3 is now officially in the running for best movie of the year, again regardless of genre.",Null,58,120,21 April 2013
Captain Marvel," Below Average and the WORST MCU Movie By Far (4/10)
","On my 'Best Comic Book Movies of All-Time' list I place Captain Marvel at #36. Shows you the extent of its blandness. It's not offensively bad but it is annoyingly below average. Better than such things as X-Men Origins: Wolverine and Rise of the Silver Surfer but not by much. Captain Marvel being close to that quality is a stunning turn for the MCU and certainly the worst effort the studio has produced in their existence.Captain Marvel is to Marvel Studios what the Vietnam War was to America. Controversial endeavor that the powers to be deemed necessary but overall detrimental. To quote Bill Murray's Stripes: 'We've been kickin' ass for 200 years. We're 10 and 1.' Well, Marvel Studios is now 20-1 but that's still a damn good win loss record! Still a fan of the MCU and hoping for a return to glory for the MCU with Endgame.",Null,3,5,10 March 2019
Molly's Game," Chastain save the day!
","Molly's Game- What starts out as a dry story about what appears to be a rather unlikable braggart turns out to be something more by the end of the film. I love money and I like poker but piecing it all together with repetitive narration frankly would have lost me as a viewer had it not been for Jessica Chastain. She eats up the screen and, not to go all 'Wolf of Wall Street,' but jargon and supposition goes down so much better looking at an amazing woman with spectacular cleavage. The final act and character arc really saves the movie. There are signs that things have been whitewashed and that Molly may not have been the noble soul that hits the screen yet it an intriguing tale and worth the watch.",Null,10,20,11 January 2018
No Country for Old Men," Offensively BAD
","I really really hate this film and I'm flabbergasted at the amount of alleged love for it. I still refuse to believe that some of these positive reviews here are legitimate. Still, maybe my expectations were skewed going in to it. I was expecting a 'Walking Tall' meets 'Fargo' movie, a quirky and intense tough guy crime drama that would leave me satisfied. This movie and especially its resolution are the least satisfying in recent memory.I've read the elitist argument about deeper themes and beautiful cinematography but without a story to pull it all together, who cares? To me, a movie is primarily about character and story. Even great performances and direction can't save a bad concept or story. This story is ugly on paper and it's despicable on screen. Some of the spoilers have been disgusted here so, there's no need to rehash them. Needless to say, killing characters may haunt and disturb the viewer but it's cheap emotion that normal movie goers will resent. The piecemeal dialogue is also off putting. Every exchange seems to be a poor parody tribute to Pulp Fiction style of dialog. Tommy Lee Jones' character being the worst 'witty' offender.I guarantee you that word of mouth from average movie goers will be quite poor for this trash. The only good thing is that after, people will feel truly betrayed by the critical consensuses and praise for it. This will farther erode trust in opinions of the critics. Making critics even more useless is never a bad thing. When I see the TV commercials for Old Country and the quotes they use, I resent every word and every critic mentioned. After others waste time and effort with this movie, I won't be the only resentful one.Terrible, terrible movie.",Null,58,141,21 November 2007
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," HUGE Misfire with Luke but the rest of the story was smart
","So many conflicting thoughts when trying to fully review what hits the screen. Did expectations play too large a part or were certain events really as anti-climatic as they feel??? While heady and interesting, there was a lack of emotional connection overall. At key times, in what should have been big plot turns things felt a bit hallow. Not to say it was all unfulfilling but a lot simply didn't pay off with as much impact as the characters deserved. (Luke's fate being chief among them) Overall, Luke's arc finished with him appearing to be a whinny crybaby and his actions since Kylo's defection seemed overblown and snivel-like in nature. Taking little of what Obi-Wan and Yoda taught him and ignoring lessons learned from the original trilogy. I simply didn't like how Luke was written in this film. What I did love was that there were many plot angles that didn't go in the direction they were appearing to go. Cliches were broken quite a bit and I found that to be refreshingly smart. Heroes weren't always heroes and were actually wrong on multiple occasions. Like established in Force Awakens, this trilogy is mostly Rey's arc and that was the primary focus. Yet, there is a credibility issue when everything she is accomplishing comes with no training or teaching. She is a 'superwoman' and is nearly infallible simply because she's a self made 'tough chick'. Maybe too much 'SJW-ism' at play? With all the big gun characters used up from the original trilogy, it'll be interesting if not a bit disconcerting where they go from here. It honestly doesn't feel like the torch as been passed properly. The new generation doesn't connect with me on a passionate level. They are 'OK' and is that enough going forward?",Null,0,0,15 December 2017
12 Strong," Exceptionalism is on display ... TRUE Heroes!
","Exceptionalism is on display all the way through this film that depicts the amazing efforts of true life heroes, soldiers and yes WARRIORS. The battle scenes are intense as well as captivating. They illicit true fear and emotion. Hemsworth and the cast do a great job. My only quibble comes from how the story was told. It's very procedural in its delivery. I wanted to learn more about these men as people and wanted to feel the rage of the era. Meaning, I wanted to feel/remember how the country was angry over the cowardly attacks of 9/11 and how everyone was willing to sacrifice anything to combat the dastardly attack and to make those responsible pay. I can't say the movie does a good job in either of those efforts. More set up was in order and more development of depth was needed to do these remarkable men justice. Yet, it's great to see this actual story receiving attention and the heroes being portrayed as such.",Null,5,18,19 January 2018
Wonder Woman," Thank You Marvel! Wonder Woman Copies Better Movies
","One thing that pure DC fans should be doing at this point is getting down on their kneed and thanking God that the WB finally learned their lesson and started flat out copying Marvel beat for beat. Without blatantly ripping off Captain America: The First Avenger and Thor (Thor: The Dark World) this Wonder Woman movie would be nothing. Without 'borrowing' every element and 'Marvelizing' the character, I'm betting all we'd have is another music video/Zack Snyder candy fart of a movie. So, instead of stoking the rivalry, DC fans should just say THANK YOU and move on. (Hoping that Justice League as copied Avengers) Overall, a pretty good movie BECAUSE the copied the MCU formula.BTW- Gal Gadot is awesome. Casting also saved this effort. She's got ravishingly good looks, the perfect physique and a pure innocent charm and confidence the character needed and that the camera eats up.",Null,3,10,6 June 2017
The Wolverine," GREAT FILM that delivers an austere, intense vibe!
","Mangold has nailed the character and the action, and Hugh Jackman brought the character to the next level like he deserved to do. He is finally part of a Wolverine movie that truly showcases the true character and the true coolness of that character. The Wolverine has a more subdued tone than any of Logan's past screen appearances. They did reflect on the books as Logan is grim and silent throughout the entire first half of Act One. The austere, intense vibe of the piece is reminiscent of the solemnity of the 1980s Chris Claremont/Frank Miller comic book storyline upon which the film is based. It's not a direct adaptation of course but it's very true to that classic storyline and tone.What is it with great comic book movies and train scenes? Spider-Man 2 delivered an all-time comic book movie highlight and now The Wolverine may have done it one better! The entire movie is awesome but the train sequence may be the highlight of the year. Logan takes on a number of Yakuza inside a Japanese train car and, because of a plot turn, he's VERY vulnerable. With his life on the line, It's full on berserker rage that we all wanted to see! This is a perfectly realistic and wonderfully choreographed fight and the best gritty action in any X-realted film to date by far. They play with the claustrophobic space of the train car and that adds another unique element. When the action shifts to on top of the train car, it's as good if not better than what we saw in Spider-Man 2. I say better because the entire fight demands Logan use some thought in how he'll attack; it's not just slash, hack, slash. At super high speeds, it becomes a game of chess with the deadly Yakuza. As with the rest of the film, here the film delivers some excellent and fitting humor that never breaks the tension but is perfect and adds to the enjoyment. This is a terrific action scene and one terrific movie.",Null,2,6,29 July 2013
The Martian," Castaway on Mars - very well done
","This movie is pretty much exactly as advertised and in this case that's a good thing. It truly is 'Castaway on Mars' with the same emotional attachment but with a lot of science thrown in. The cast really delivered. The first act is quite slowly paced and comes across like watching someone solve a procedural math equation. Had the entire film been like that, it would have been a dull one note film. Instead, introducing strife and communications really added perfect texture to the film. I loved the brief religious references and the ending message. Keep working the problem diligently and when it's time you get to go home. As with the movie Castaway, a deep concept and a wonder life lesson and message.",Null,4,62,2 October 2015
