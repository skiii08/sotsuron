Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," One of the best MARTIAL ARTS films ever made
","As many people have laughed at me for saying so, I have always considered the Star Wars series not as Sci-Fi films, but as MARTIAL ARTS films.  All the elements found in Japanese Samurai films and Hong Kong Action films are there.  There's:1) A treacherous martial arts school whose leader has tipped the scale of balance towards tyranny (Palpatine's Sith)2) The last true warrior of the Righteous martial arts school, who is regrettably weakened by age (Obi Wan of the Jedi)3) A kind hearted young prodigy who will avenge both his master and/or his father's death and bring justice back to the world (Luke Skywalker)4) Last but not least, wondrous mystical powers obtained by masters of the martial art that will totally underwhelm firearm users (Yoda's telekinesis, Darth Vader's firearm reflection, ETC.)Although Star Wars had all these elements, it is regrettable that Hong Kong Action cinema had not yet made a significant influence on America back in 1977-1983.  Now, with the inspirations of works by Hong Kong directors like Tsui Hark, George Lucas has finally made a MARTIAL ARTS film out of the Star Wars universe.This film really showed what being a Jedi is about!  The absolute grace and lethality that Obi Wan and Qui Gon fought with further enchances the tragedy of the Jedi's fall, losing all of the greatest secrets of their Martial Art. Not even squadrons of droids weilding firearms (cowards) could stand against two true warriors.Ray Park, although playing the sinister Darth Maul, made the film as great as it was and was its true hero.  Being a Wushu (Chinese Martial Art) champion really helped him to set the screen alight in white hot intensity as he faced off against the two good Jedi.  They were no match for him as he kicked, punched, flipped and spun his staff saber with blinding speed.It was only through lucky charlatanism that Obi Wan managed to slay Maul. Nevertheless, Ray Park has shown the beauty of Chinese Martial Arts in this film and has a promising carrer ahead of him.Here are a few suggestions for the production of the next film:1) Directed by Tsui Hark of John Woo2) Fights choreographed by Yuen Woo Ping (Once Upon A Time in China, The Matrix)3) Starring Jet Li and/or Chow Yun Fat.Forget the Matrix, Rush Hour, or Lethal Weapon 4.  Thank you George Lucas for making the best MARTIAL ARTS film since Once Upon A Time In China.",Null,0,0,11 July 1999
The Mummy," An admirable and thoroughly enjoyable attempt at imitating Hong Kong Action/Horror Films
","The mere trailer of this film dahsed my expectations of it being yet another dull American made 'action' trash.  Although it still contained the obligatory one-liners, goofy humour (that's perfectly alright) and brainless babes, this film is excellent in its burrowing of Hong Kong action/horror elements.Hong Kong action, you say.  Get with it, guys.  The way that Colonel Rich O'Conell (Brendan Fraser) fought with two guns blazing at the same time looked like he just came from doing a John Woo film.  In fact, the clumsy way that he fought with two guns endearingly reminds one of Chow Yun Fat's antics from his first John Woo film, 'A Better Tomorrow.'  As well as him, many of the other characters, including the wimpy Jonathan, fought in the 'John Woo's double pistol style of Martial Arts' throughout the film.Secondly, there are the classic Hong Kong style shots of a mighty magical villain (Vasoloo) holding his arms in the air and commanding a horde of underlings to do his bidding beneath him.  The way that Imhotep summoned his underlings of insects and Godlike Powers comes straight from Hong Kong Horror Films like 'A Chinese Ghost Story' 'The Bride With White Hair' and other 'Hopping Vampire' movies.  There is the heroe's desperate sword-to-claw stand against a horde of toothed horrors, as well as his futile attempt to fight the evil lord (Imhotep) himself bare handed.Finally, there is that undeniable shot from 'A Better Tomorrow' of the final stand of three men against a tide of endless enemy, each armed with double pisotls, a machine gun and a shotgun.  This technique has also been used in the disgustingly funny 'From Dusk till dawn.'Overall, for it's admirable attempt at copying Hong Kong Action/horror Theatre, this is a great film to pass time with.",Null,0,0,9 July 1999
The Matrix," The best martial arts movie in the past year.
","Forget 'Rush Hour', a film that exploited the lovable talents of Jackie Chan to promote the unforgivably irritating Chris Tucker.  Don't even look at 'Lethal Weapon 4', which could have been the death Knell for the wonderful Jet Li's career had it not done so well in the box office.  THE Martial Arts mobie to see in 1999 (besides the upcoming 'PHANTOM MENACE') is 'The Matrix.'  Kudos once again to action choreography master Yuen Woo Ping (who worked with Jet Li in 'ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA', A MASTERPIECE).  Mr Yuen weaves a tapestry of white hot intensity as in all of his Hong Kong efforts. Nobody in the Matrix merely punches or kicks; Under Mr Yuen's direction, the cast dodges, flips, run up walls, evade, block, leap and deliver shattering multiple blows, all with consideration to the surrounding architecture.  Mr Yuen's work is further enhanced by the seamlessly integrated computer imagery which made the confrontations of the heroes (and villains) into nothing short of a superhuman clash of titans.  Don't work with Van Damn, Mr Yuen!! Work with Jet in Star Wars II.  Keep up the good work!!",Null,0,0,13 April 1999
