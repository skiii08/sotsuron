Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," By far the best comedy of 2006...
","Borat, without a doubt, is the best comedy of 2006. I cannot emphasize enough how funny it is... While Borat is not a movie for everyone (yes, it will offend those who live sheltered lives), it is indeed a triumph in cinema. Just like other comedies designed to promote satirical statements on our American Culture, Borat does exactly what it sets out to do: points out the stupidity of others in an underhanded fashion.I want to keep this review short, so I'll just say this: I laughed so hard I almost peed my pants. It was THAT funny.By the way, folks... it has NOTHING in comparison to Jackass. Why other reviewers keep drawing that parallel baffles me.See Borat if you can handle crude satire (Team America and South Park both come to mind, which are also VERY similar in nature)... you'll love it.",10,3,15,1 December 2006
Casino Royale," FANTASTIC movie! Daniel Craig was a brilliant choice!
","The best Bond movie to date! That's right - it's better than any of them! Casting Daniel Craig (whom I thought would be great in the role anyway after seeing Layer Cake a year ago) was a really brilliant choice to fill the suit left behind by Pierce Brosnan. After seeing Casino Royale there really is no doubt that Craig was a worthy successor to the franchise.The actual movie in and of itself was more real-world and less fantastic gadgetry, bringing a grittier and dirtier inexperienced Bond to life and steering way clear of the improbably mundane trappings of an 'impending doom for the world' film. No, the plot within Casino Royale is more believable because it doesn't rely on James doing anything more than keeping his cool and keeping his feet on the ground.Of the entire franchise I believe Casino Royale really takes the lead in the pack, perhaps by a nose, as a spectacularly grounded and hard-hitting James Bond embarks upon his first mission and truly earns his keep as a double-o agent.Great job, Mr. Craig... please return soon!",10,2,5,1 December 2006
