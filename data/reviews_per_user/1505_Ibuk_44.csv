The Incredible Hulk," Finally a Hulk movie to be proud of
","I know I have been probably a year late in posting my review for this movie but I honestly didn't feel I couldn't post a review for it till I watch it again. Despite being a financial success TIH had the misfortune of being released amongst other Superhero movies, The Iron Man and more famously The Dark Knight. I saw Ang Lee's Hulk in the cinema and it left such a bitter taste in my mouth that I refused to see the Ed Norton version. I later caught TIH on DVD and regretted the fact that I didn't catch it on the big screen because in my opinion it is far far better.In my opinion Ang Lee's version was a ponderous mess that should have been less talky and had more action. Another criticism I have of Ang Lee's version is that in my opinion they overcomplicated the story, instead of being just about Bruce and his battle to cure himself they tried to link it back to his father whilst TIH is far more simple.After the critical backlash Hulk received it does look the producers learnt their less. Hulk in my opinion waffled on quite a bit whilst TIH is more to the point. For instance we see the gamma radiation accident in the opening credits so we skip right to the action whilst Ang Lee's version took up at least half an hour before that even occurred. TIH boasts of some good action sequences and a fine story to back it up. Plus Ed Norton is a far better actor than Eric Bana. I love how it toffs it cap to the TV show, Lou Ferrigno and Stan Lee both have special appearances and Bill Bixby is seen on TV and there was an instance where they used the music from the original show.My only criticism of TIH is that they didn't show enough of The Abomination and felt they only included him so that Hulk could fight him at the end and give the audience a thrilling ending. In my opinion TIH is head and shoulders above most recent superheroes movies(Fantastic Four,Spiderman 3, X Men 3 etc).",6,0,1,28 May 2009
Iron Man 3," All in all a bitter disappointment
","I haven't reviewed something on IMDb for quite a while but after seeing Iron Man 3 today I felt compelled to express my thoughts on it. First of all let me say that this is my first 2013 release that I've seen. I really liked Iron Man and also quite liked Iron Man 2 so I was quite looking forward to seeing the third instalment. This is the first Iron Man movie Jonathan Favreau didn't direct, I really feel that if he had decided to direct the third instalment we would have been given a better movie than this debacle. All in all I frankly thought it was positively dire on all levels. The returning cast members I felt weren't really up to scratch. Special mention to Paltrow who I've always felt was badly miscast as Pepper Potts. The villains I thought were incredibly poor in this one. I really felt there was no meat to their characters whatsoever and no special character trait that would make them awesome villains. Pearce I thought was disappointing but the biggest disappointment was from Ben Kingsley. He basically did what he's been doing for years, pimping himself for Hollywood in substandard movies in insignificant roles that do nothing for his career. To sum my thoughts in one sentence I just felt it lacked the emotional power of the previous Iron Man movies, I didn't really care for any of the characters. Without giving too much away the one thing that surprised me was the conclusion. I can only hope that my next cinema experience is better than this one, although it wouldn't have to do very much to surpass it. All in all a very bitter disappointment. My rating for Iron Man 3: 5.5/10",5,38,80,25 April 2013
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Raiders of the last ark-
","Harrison Ford has starred in two of my favourite movie franchises- Star Wars and the Indiana Jones trilogy. Harrison Ford will be mostly remembered for two roles, the first being Han Solo the second being Indiana Jones. Right from the moment go, where Indiana Jones is chased by a boulder you know you are in a rollicking adventure. The movie is basically a barrage of stunts put together beautifully. Denholm Eliott provides fantastic support as his sidekick Marcus. This was easily the best in the trilogy, apparently there are talks of another sequel in the making but don't hold me to it. Harrison Ford after Star Wars you have me proud again.",9,0,1,29 October 2007
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," E.T.- One of Spielberg's best
","One reason why I love Steven Spielberg is that he is so diverse, he can multi million franchises like Jurassic Park but he also make terrific one off movies like E.T.. I loved this movie as a child and I love it to this day. This is a touching tale of a boy and his friendship with a Alien.All the children were fantastic but my favourite was Drew Barrymoore, who was fantastic as Henry Thomas's younger sister. Actually writing about E.T. just reminded that almost a decade ago B.T. made an ad that was a homage to E.T and the tagline was 'BT phone home' (get it haha!!). E.T. is a unique movie whose success cannot be replicated. The only regret is that I didn't manage to catch it in the cinema seeing that I was born a couple of years after it came out. In one word magical.",9,0,0,30 October 2007
Citizen Kane," Quite simply one of the top 5 movies ever made
","When released Citizen Kane was a box office disaster. Yet over the years it has become a misunderstood masterpiece. It's hard to believe that Orson Welles was only 25 when he made this gem. I have to admit I am not a fan of old movies yet Citizen Kane kept me engrossed throughout the duration of the movie. The story(as if I even need to say)involves Citizen Kane, a recluse who utters the word Rosebud before he dies. What follows is a mystery to find out the meaning of his last words. We see his life from the perspective of the people who knew him(his ex wife,his best friend and many more people). We go back to his childhood, when his parents give him up so he can have a better upbringing. Then he sets up a newspaper company through which Kane exposes scandals of politicians. We see his first marriage fall apart, coincidentally if I am not mistaken his first wife was played by Agnes Moorehead who also starred as Endora as Betwitched. We even see him trying to become politician but rumours of Kane being involved with a woman is circulated by his rivals. That results in him having to hand over his business to his partner. Then he distances himself from society until his death. Even at the end the people didn't manage to find out the meaning of the word Rosebud but we as the viewers do(don't worry I am not going to spoil it for those who haven't seen it). I see Kane as a remarkable character He is stubborn yet principled, a very good example is in the scene where his friend gives Kane's wife, who is a actress a bad review and how he reacts. Citizen Kane has opened my eyes to old movies and I will definitely try to watch Orson Welle's other work. Citizen Kane is one of the best movies ever made and the fact that the audience couldn't accept it at the time is most certainly their loss.",10,0,2,8 November 2008
Spider-Man 2," Spiderman 2- A sequel that surpasses the original
","First of all let me just say that Spiderman 1 was good but not perfect. The only other sequel I preferred to the original was Superman 2. All the regulars return but this time the villain is Dr Octavious played by Alfred Molina. In my opinion however I thought Williem Dafoe was better as the villain. Everything was perfect, the scripting, the acting and the action sequences. For an superhero movie it is also quite emotional but that just adds to the appeal. There was also the hint of a revenge subplot between Harry Osborn and Spiderman. Spiderman 2 is the best in the franchise so far.I also went to see Spiderman 3 but to be honest I was slightly disappointed. That isn't enough to deter me from watching future sequels though. No.4 bring it on!!!",9,7,9,29 October 2007
Home Alone," Home Alone- A firm holiday classic
","Where would the holidays be without the antics of Kevin Mcallister. When released it became a huge hit and made Macaulay Culkin a mega star. It was directed by Chris Columbus, who was also responsible for bringing Harry Potter to the big screen. For a kids movie it is pretty violent, but that only adds to the overwhelming appeal of this classic.Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern were superb as the burgles who are no match for an 8 year old.In fact Home Alone is reminiscent of the Tom and Jerry cartoons where someone would get hit over a thousand and would still be able to stand back up and go back for more. Some of the traps Kevin sets for the burgles for ingenious. Home Alone spawned 3 more sequels but only the second movie could come close to matching the genius of the original. Violent but immense fun for all ages.",8,0,0,23 December 2007
The Jungle Book," Jungle Book - Classic Disney
","This has to be one of my favourite Disney movie, ahead of Lion King and Toy Story. I have very fond memories of this classic. Disney's movies these days lack the magic of classics like Jungle Book, 3 or 4 years they would be forgotten. Even the sequel of Jungle Book was woeful and tired and was an insult to the original.This Disney movie had everything. Classic songs, my favourite is the Bare Nessecities, Memorable characters and a decent story.The story of Jungle Book goes like this, Mowgli is abandoned by his Mother as a child and was brought up by Bagheera. Years pass and Mowgli is now a young boy when Bagheera hears that man hater Sher Khan is returning to the jungle. It is decided that the jungle is now unsafe and Mowgli must go to the city to live with his own people. Mowgli and Bagheera start their journey through the jungle where they meet Baloo, who can I say is my favourite character. Baloo refuses to let Mowgli return to the village but goes along with them anyway, cue lots of memorable songs and heaps of fun.On their travels they bump into several interesting characters (Kaa, King Louie, Haathi etc). In the end what happens is Mowgli falls in love and leaves the jungle(please forgive me if I have missed anything). Pure Disney Gold that will live forever.",10,1,2,7 November 2007
Spider-Man 3," Spiderman 3 - A slight disappointment
","I liked the first one, I loved No.2, so I thought I had to give No.3 a go. Even during the first few reels I knew I had made the wrong choice. First of all I thought the Harry Osborn/ Spiderman storyline had potential but they underused it. I mean why bother introducing another villain when you could have Harry Osborn taking revenge on Spiderman.I am not sure if I am the only one but I felt that Spiderman 3 was not that well thought out. At first Peter Parker turned evil when that 'thing' (sorry don't know what else to call it) took over his body and then during the last few reels the 'thing' latches onto someone else. As a result of that none of the villains were that terrifying because they didn't have that much screen time, which is a huge drawback. Even the emotional moments, which worked for Spiderman 2 looked corny in No.3.This movie however doesn't seem that bad when you consider the fact that when it came to the third sequel, Superman 3 and Batman were considerably weaker compared to the first two. One bad sequel isn't enough to deter me from watching any future sequels.",6,0,1,19 November 2007
The Terminator," The Terminator- The ultimate Sci-fi flick
","Terminator is a great movie because it blends sci-fi and action perfectly. I first saw it at the age of six or seven and unsurprisingly it confused me. A few years later I caught it on TV and loved it. I was browsing through my local videostore a few weeks ago and it caught my eye and brought it. After viewing it again I loved it even more. Arnold Shwartznegger was great as The Terminator, this movie shot him to superstardom. I loved Terminator 2: Judgement day and I liked T3:rise of the machines to a certain extent but none of the sequels had the same impact the original had on me. This in my opinion James Cameron's best work, Aliens and True Lies were good and Titanic I find very overrated.",10,0,1,27 May 2008
Alien," Alien- the granddaddy of all horror movies
","I only watched it for the first time a couple of weeks ago. To be honest I didn't know what to expect since I had heard some pretty mixed reviews. I not only loved Alien but it would also take up quite a high spot on my top 100 movies list. It was chilling, well written and masterfully directed by Ridley Scott. There are several scenes that still send a shiver down my spine no matter how many times I watch it, for instance the scene in which the alien comes out of John Hurt. Sigourney Weaver never looked sexier. Since then I have made it my mission to view Ridley Scott's other work which I hadn't seen before. I thought Blade Runner was rather boring but I absolutely loved American Gangster. Viewing most of his movies made me realise that Alien is his finest work. Aliens wasreally good but not a patch on the original. Along with Halloween Alien is my favourite horror movie. An unmissable horror flick.",9,0,1,7 May 2008
Lost in Translation," making great movies is in her genes
","Sofia Coppola,daugther of legendary director Francis Ford Coppola made a very impressive debut with Lost In Translation. Even though this is her first movie you can clearly see he is completely in control. The performances from Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanson were brilliant and the storyline was exceptional. Lost In Translation tells the story of an actor(Bill Murray)who goes to Japan to star in a couple of ads. He ends up in the same hotel as Scarlett Johanson who is on holiday with her husband,it is clearly obvious from the first scene that she is neglected by him. They meet in a bar one night and there is instantly a connection. Not a sexual one, more of a father-daugther one. In my opinion Bill Murray is trying to compensate for not being there for his own kids by being like a father to her. In the scene where Murray insists that Scarlett goes to the hospital to get something on her foot checked out is a great example. Then they go to see all the sights around Japan and that forms the rest of the story. To top it up all the movie is laced with funny instances that don't looked forced but is more natural. At the end of the movie there is a famous scene where they are hugging and they are saying something that is rather muffled. I don't know why but the movie struck a chord with me, I can't remember the last time I saw a movie where I got emotionally involved. LIT is a completely fulfilling experience about strangers spending time in a country that is alien to them.",9,2,4,9 December 2008
The Thing," John Carpenter's homage to the B monster movies
",I saw this movie many many years ago on TV and hadn't seen it for a while. It was on TV again last night and decided I should give it another go. I am very glad I did because it is a tremendously entertaining horror movie from the master of the genre John Carpenter. The movie concerns a bunch of research scientists who investigate an isolated place and find some kind of deformed creature and take it for research hoping to gain recognition for their discovery. What they don't know however is that the creature is very much alive and it's not long before it starts taking over their bodies. It is then upto the crew to decide which one of them has been taken over by the creature by taking a series of tests cue bags of tension. This could have been simply awesome but it ends up being just great. The problem is not the script or the climax but the fact that it bears quite a bit of resemblance to Alien(my favourite horror movie). For example in The Thing the scene where The Thing comes out of one the scientists body is similar to that famous John Hurt scene in Alien. One interesting point is that in John Carpenter's Halloween the original version of The Thing is playing in the background. Despite it's minor flaws The Thing is a pretty great monster movie and one of the best horror movies of the 80's.,8,0,1,7 July 2008
The Shining," My first Kubrick
","The Shining is a very special movie for me because it was the very first Stanley Kubrick movie I watched. Adapted from a Stephen King novel it tells the story of a couple(Jack Nicolson and Shelley Duvall) and their young son(Danny Lloyd) who move to a hotel when Jack Nicolson gets a job as a caretaker. The hotel however has a horrific past,years ago it was the scene for a grisly murder where a man murdered his two daugthers. The caretaker's son happens to possess 'The Shining, which is a gift of second sight. Even before they move in the son starts to have horrific visions of the the murder that occurred years ago. Very soon Jack Nicolson starts to get possessed by the spirit of the man, the very first example of that is in the scene where he says to his wife that he has a feeling that he has been to the hotel before when he knows he hasn't. Add to that the fact that to save costs the hotel is shut for most of the year and you have a superbly compelling horror movie. In the superb climax Jack Nicolson attempts to murder both his wife and his son. The star of the show has to Jack Nicolson who was simply phenomenal, in fact I would call it his best performance I have seen. His transition from a mild mannered man to an axe wielding psycho was simply wonderful. The stately pace works very well in it's favour. The Shining is one of my top 5 horror movies ever made and is highly recommended by me to tose who haven't seen it.",10,0,0,1 February 2009
Spider-Man," Spiderman- Slightly flawed but a sound base to build on
","First of all let me say that it is always difficult to introduce a Superhero to the big screen and provide a sound base for future sequels to build on. Superman managed it, The Fantastic Four on the other hand didn't. Spiderman is somewhere in between.I preferred No. 2 to Spiderman No.1 because in Spiderman they spent too long explaining the origins of Spiderman, actually this is one minor problem with the first Superman movie. On the other hand I thought the villain in the Spiderman No.1 was far better than the one in Spiderman 2. Williem Dafoe was superb as the Green Goblin, he was terrifying. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst was also superb as Peter Parker and Mary Jane. If the responsibility of bringing the web slinging Superhero had fallen into the wrong hands it could have been a whole lot worse. Not a bad effort at all.",7,0,1,7 December 2007
The Exorcist," The Exorcist- all that fuss about nothing
","Out of all movies I think horror movies date the most. Horror films just don't have the same impact they had when they first released. Two movies that come to mind are Carrie and the Exorcist. When released they were heavily praised and were hits.I watched it a couple of years ago and I was unimpressed. I had such huge expectations but I was severely let down. Just because it was disturbing does not make it a good horror movie. It would have worked as a psychological drama but not as horror. The theme tune however is memorable and chilling. Im sorry if I have offended fans of this movie,it may have appealed to you but I was disappointed. Maybe I should give it another go to see if I enjoy it second time around.",4,2,9,13 January 2008
The Usual Suspects," Simply amazing
","After hearing people rave about this movie I finally managed to watch this movie a couple of months ago. I have to admit it the first time I disliked it, I probably wasn't concentrating. The second time I absolutely loved it. The usual suspect is fantastic twisty thriller backed up by wonderful performances from all the main leads.It seems hard to imagine thatthe writer of The Usual Suspects was only twenty four when he wrote it.Kevin Spacey in my opinion completely stole the show. Even though I knew whatthe final twist was it did hinder me from appreciating it. What is so amazing is how the writer managed to skillfully put in clues that could lead us to a conclusion but the references are so slight we might not notice it. It seems to have inspired other movies with twists at the end that leave your head spinning, for instance The Sixth Sense. The Usual Suspects in my opinion is the best thriller of the 90's.",8,1,1,4 July 2008
Quantum of Solace," Not bad 2nd Craig Bond
","OK this is my third comment on QOS, the first one got so many negative responses I felt I had no choice but to delete, the second one I didn't feel do it justice and now this is my third(in fact I have never had to do so many reviews for one movie before). Those who did catch my first comment before I deleted it will know that I was repulsed by it(I remember using the phrase about it belonging at the bottom of Hollywood's sewer). On my second viewing I was rather surprised about the fact that I actually enjoyed it(which prompted me to delete my original review). On my third viewing I really enjoyed it, in fact a lot more than some of the older Bond movies(YOLT,DAF,LALD, TMWTGG, Octopussy,AVTAK and the Brosnan Bond's not including GE which I like. QOS takes place right after Casino Royale. Bond, still reeling after Vesper's betrayal goes on the hunt for businessman Dominic Greene who has brought a plot of land in a desert. It soon transpire that Dominic Greene plans to take control of Bolivia's water supply. Add to that a vengeful Bond girl(Camille) who wants to kill Colonel Medrano who has links to Dominic Greene and you have an intensely gripping Bond movie.What I didn't like about QOS on my first viewing is what I enjoy so much about it now. For instance on my first viewing I found the character of Dominic Greene rather ordinary but I realise now that is part of his appeal. The producers wanted to give a QOS a more grounded feel to it and therefore didn't make Dominic Greene into some megalomaniac but wanted to make him more understated and seem more human than previous Bond villains like Blofeld for instance. Another thing I enjoy about QOS now that I didn't like on my first viewing is how it toffs it caps to previous Bond movies. I love the Goldfinger tribute when Strawberry Fields is killed by Greene and is dowsed in Oil. QOS, although it received mainly positive feedback from fans it has also received much negativity. I think the negativity comes from the fact that at time QOS doesn't feel like a Bond movie. It is more to the point than most Bond movies, at just under 110 minutes it is probably one of the shortest Bond movie. QOS has not only appealed to fans of Bond but also from non Bond fans. I think gaining appreciation from non Bond fans is vitally important if the producers want to franchise to continue and be successful. I think QOS's main strength is it's action sequences, in particular the opening car chase. I don't know what the general consensus about the action sequences in QOS but I find them to be shockingly brutal.What I learnt about QOS on my third viewing is that it's one of those Bond movies which some Bond fans may have to watch more than once to fully appreciate it's brilliance.",6,1,4,20 September 2009
No Country for Old Men," Simply amazing
","After hearing many people rave about this movie I finally got a chance to see what the hype was about when I brought it on DVD. It would be fair to say I was not disappointed. Adapted from a Cormac McCarthy novel it tells the story of a man who stumbles upon a large amount of cash and how it starts off a chain of violence. Javier Bardem was outstanding as the uncompromising Anton Chigurh and Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones provided great support. The movie moves at quite a stately pace but that works in its favour. There are many moments that disturb me, for instance in the last scene where Anton Chigurh kills Josh Brolin's wife just because he promised him he will kill her. I am not familiar with Coen Brothers work but I will definitely check out their work after seeing NCFOM. NCFOM is one of the best movies of last year and is worthy of it's hype.",9,1,3,10 July 2008
Batman Begins," Batman Begins-The franchise back on track
","The Dark Knight is coming out soon so I thought as a tribute I should review the previous outing. I have been a fan of the Batman movies ever since the first Batman(1989)came out when I was four. Viewing it now I could not believe that I actually loved it once, it is an overrated piece of tripe. Oh well enough about the first one Batman Begins is wonderful,I would call it better than the original. I only viewed it for the first time after I purchased the DVD and from the first few reels I was hooked. Batman is a welcome return for one of my favourite superheroes after some pretty awful outings. Batman Forever was OK but Batman and Robin was shameful and an embarrassment to fans of Batman. Christopher Nolan is rather good,Micheal Caine is good as Alfred,Gary Oldman was good but Katie Holmes disappointed. BB tells the story of Bruce Wanye before he became Batman, which I found fascinating to find out. At the end there is a reference to Joker,Jack Nicolson played him in the first Batman and Heath Ledger(may he rest in peace)will be playing him in The Dark Knight. Batman Begins has put the franchise back on track after it derailed.",10,3,4,30 May 2008
Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi," Shah Rukh comes to the Chopra's rescue again
","After the financial disaster of Lamhe and Parampara, Yash Chopra casted a then relatively unknown actor called Shah Rukh Khan for his next venture Darr. Not only was the movie hugely successful but it made Shah Rukh an overnight sensation. Since then he has been the Chopra's lucky mascot,Dil to pagal hai,Veer Zaara(for Yash Chopra), DDLJ,Mohhabatein and Rab ne bana di jodi(for son Aditya Chopra) and Chak De India for Yash Raj films. Whilst it is not as good as DDLJ(then again what movie is?)it is a vast improvement on Mohabbatein. Yash Raj films produced 4 films last year, Jhoom Barabar Jhoom,Tara rum pum pum,Aaja Nachle and Chak De India, Chak De was their only hit and it was a massive one at that. So with Aditya Chopra going behind the camera lens Shah Rukh was the safest best.Shah Rukh is given a very different look, he has a moustache and wears glasses. It tells a story of a very ordinary man who enters into a marriage with a lively girl after her father passes away. She despises him whilst he does everything to please her. She enters into a dancing contest but is embarrassed at the thought of having to dance with her ordinary husband. Then Shah Rukh has an idea, he takes on a completely new avtar and aims to make her fall in love with him. He cuts of his moustache and changes his look but doesn't have the courage to tell her. So he assumes two identities, one as her dancing partner and one as her husband. Things get complicated when she starts to fall in love with her dancing partner not realising that it's actually her husband. Shah Rukh realises that the dancing partner has to break her heart and she will have to go back to her husband. In the finale the ordinary husband shows off his moves he learnt from attending the dance classes and his wife falls in love with him. My enjoyment was marred by the improbable plot. I am not bearded and nor do I wear glasses, according to the logic of this movie if tomorrow I don a beard and wear glasses my own family will not be able to recognise me, that doesn't sound right to me. Now onto the music, as per usual in a Chopra production the songs are absolutely top notch. Haule Haule is very very good and Tuj me rab dikta hai is one of the best love songs I have heard in a long long time. RNBDJ is pretty entertaining leave your brains at the door fare from the Chopra's and much much better than I expected. Recommended by me,7/10",7,10,19,16 April 2009
Transformers," Transformers- all style no substance
","This has to be one of the most disappointing films I have seen this year. I had heard some really bad reviews for transformers but I went to see it anyway. Boy did I regret it. First of all the script was very weak. Secondly there was no heart in it, the Megan Fox/ Shia Lebeouf love story had potential but was under used. Thirdly they should have just focused on one city rather than show the transformers turning up in Iraq too (I think it was Iraq but not sure). It was all a bit disjointed.Now onto the positives(actually I mean positive). The transformers looked really cool and there were one to two good action sequences.To me Transformers just looked like a barrage of action sequences put hazily together with no soul in it. Miss this one, there are better summer blockbusters to watch, like for instance Live free and Die hard.",4,4,9,10 November 2007
The Dark Knight," Ideal for a great 'Knight' out
","Please forgive for the corny pun,I just couldn't resist it. I just came back from viewing TDK and I must say it was very very good, though not as good as Batman Begins which is my personal favourite Batman movie. I knew after watching Batman Begins that the next Batman movie would be about The Joker because there was a reference to him at the end of it. Thankfully both Nolan's and Burton's version of the Joker are completely different. In Burton's version he is more comical whilst in Nolan's version he is seen as sadistic and far more threatening. TDK was promoted as a Heath Ledger movie as this was his last movie he did before his tragic demise. I initially had reservations about the late Heath Ledger as The Joker because I didn't think he would be able to do justice to the role Jack Nicolson made famous. After viewing it I can say I was so wrong, Heath Ledger was brilliant and in some ways may have surpassed the great Jack Nicolson. Christian Bale was good as Bruce Wayne but was outshone by the brilliant Ledger. Another surprise was Aaron Ekhart's role in the second half. Even though it has only been released it seems to have amassed a cult following. I think the appeal of TDK is that it has achieved a constant threat of terror that none of the previous Batman movies have managed to achieve. In the older Batman movies the pace would be slow, then a action sequence will occur and the pace will pick up and once the action scene is over it will return to it's slow pace. With TDK it is basically one thrilling sequence after another. Whilst it is good is not nearly as good as people claim but I suppose after all the hype it is bound to fall a bit short of expectations. It is a real shame that Heath Ledger couldn't bask in his success as The Joker.My rating 8/10 highly recommended to all",8,3,7,30 July 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," 2001 A space odyssey-Possibly the greatest Sci-fi movie ever made
","I must admit the first time I viewed 2001|:A space odyssey I was unimpressed. Months later I was browsing through my local videostore and the DVD of 2001:A space odyssey caught my eye and decided I should give it another go. I am very glad I did because the second time around I loved it and have loved it since. The ape sequence at the beginning I think means that at first the apes couldn't defend themselves against rival apes and other animals but when they realise what they can do with the bones of a dead animal they can finally defend themselves. In the first twenty minutes there is hardly a word spoken instead we are treated to one of the best musical scores ever. The story itself is pretty complex but that is the beauty of 2001: A space odyssey. The last half hour is a visual feast of the highest order. 2001 is a movie that has divided most people,some people love it,some people hate it but I for one absolutely love 2001. 2001 is a remarkable piece of cinema and I would call it one of Stanly Kubrick's best after A Clockwork Orange.",10,1,8,1 June 2008
A Clockwork Orange," A Clockwork Orange- A work of sheer brilliance
","I only viewed ACO a couple of weeks ago, from the minute go I was spellbound by its sheer brilliance. Adapted from a novel by Anthony Burgess ACO is a shocking tale of redemption and revenge. When released ACO caused a huge sensation and was banned for several years. After seeing I can see why it caused so much offence, there is a fair deal of nudity and it shows the main character raping women. Until I saw ACO the only movie I had watched of Stanley Kubrick was The Shining but this is in a league of its own. After seeing this movie I also saw Kubrick's other masterpiece 2001: A Space Oddysey which I didn't fully understand but I will give another go. ACO is a landmark movie and is a work of sheer brilliance from a great director.",9,0,2,7 May 2008
Eyes Wide Shut," A shockingly real portrayal of a marriage
","This is my third favourite Kubrick movie, 2001 being my favourite and ACO being second Eyes Wide Shut is nevertheless a great movie backed by powerful performances from Cruise and Kidman. The first time I watched it I was pretty unimpressed,much like the first time I saw 2001 and that is now my favourite movie. The second time round I liked it a lot more. Eyes Wide Shut paints a very honest and mature picture of marriage and in that lies it's beauty.Despite not being married I can completely identify with Nicole Kidman,she is a bored housewife who fantasises about other men to spice up her life. When she discloses this to hubby Mr Cruise he then goes on a downhill spiral and the implications it has on their marriage. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman were brilliant in their roles as husband and wife. I suppose I may as well admit that I initially brought the DVD for Nicole Kidman and her skin show(trust me she did not disappoint me in that area) but I was not expecting to immensely enjoy it which I did. It really is an absolute shame that Mr Kubrick could not bask in it's glory for long, he died shortly after making it. Eyes Wide Shut is another addition to Mr Kubrick's fine work as a director and the industry is poorer place without him.",8,3,6,6 July 2008
Pulp Fiction," Pulp fiction- the epitome of cool
","I only viewed it for the first time a couple of months and I have to say from the moment go I loved it. It is a fascinating tale of how the main characters meet and how their paths cross over the course of the movie. I am not sure how people view it but I see Pulp Fiction as a series of episodes in one movie,my favourite being the one with Bruce Willis and what happens to him after he kills someone in the boxing ring. Another thing I loved was the star power in this movie:Uma Thurman,John Travolta,Samuel L Jackson,Bruce Willis, Christopher Walker Ving Rhames to name a few. What makes the movie so remarkable is that we as the viewers do not see the twist coming. Another quite remarkable thing about Pulp Fiction is that the conversations between the characters is actually engrossing. Pulp Fiction is a fascinating tale masterfully directed by Quentin Tarranantino.",9,1,3,30 May 2008
Titanic," Titanic - overlong and overrated
","I may not make myself popular with this statement but I hate Titanic. One reason is that it is far too long for a Hollywood movie. It spends most of its time waffling on and on and on. I went to see it in the cinema when it released it 97, it didn't impress me then it doesn't impress me now. I have liked James Cameron's previous work like Terminator and True lies but he has really disappointed this time around.Now onto the good points. The last scene was so moving and the song My heart will go on is one of my favourites. Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet were very good in their roles. I feel that it should have been made like a documentary rather than a standard 90's disaster movie. On the other hand there are millions of titanic fans and I have been known to have unusual tastes in movies. Go and see it and decide for yourself",2,10,19,6 November 2007
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Happy Potter and the Sorcerers stone- no magic for me
","I am probably one in a minority when I say that I do not like Harry Potter. I thought it was overlong and a tad bit boring, it was however funny in places. I also liked the quote at the end where Harry says 'I am not going home not really'. Harry Potter was released alongside Lord of the Ring, I saw both I preferred LOTR. I don't however hate all of the Harry Potter films, I thought the Prisoner of Azkaban was good and so was the Goblet of fire.This is a movie aimed at kids. They will be blown away by the magic and the action. I think I would have had a different view if I saw it when I was a child. Like for instance Star Wars is heavily criticized these days but I saw it as a child and I was blown away, for me it is a bit of nostalgia. Harry Potter provided no magic for me.",6,0,0,9 November 2007
The Departed," The Departed- Mr Scorcese I am now your fan
","Before I watched this movie I had read mixed reviews about it, instead of putting me off it made me even more curious. I am glad that I took a chance on it. To be honest I can't understand why people didn't like it. It is a superb drama about undercover cops. Scorcese has managed to assemble a superb class of actors, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson and Martin Sheen amongst others. DiCaprio has finally got rid of his pretty boy looks by having a more rugged look in this movie. Add to that a twist in the tale and you have a absolutely compelling drama.To be honest I have not watched any other Scorcese film apart from the Departed, after this movie I want to watch all his other classics. This was easily the best movie of 2006, Mr Scorcese you should be proud.",9,1,5,5 February 2008
Die Hard," The ultimate guy flick
",When released Die Hard was a massive success and shot Bruce Willis to fame. I loved Die Hard as a child and it was only when I brought the DVD of Die Hard 1 and 2 I realised I still love it. Bruce Willis was outstanding as the cop in the wrong place at the wrong time and Alan Rickman was equally brilliant. Die Hard is a unrelenting ride of violence and tension which results a superb bloodbath finale. Although I do love the sequels they lacked the remarkable brilliance of the original. Out of sheer loyalty to the die hard movies I went to see Die Hard 4.0 and thought that it was pretty good. Unfortunately it regular comes under criticism from fans of the original who say that the fourth installment was nothing like the first three. Die Hard is the ultimate action flick that is great for a guys night in. As a matter of fact I refuse to speak to anyone who says they dislike Die Hard.,9,1,1,20 June 2008
Psycho," The one that started it all
","When released in 1960 Psycho's impact on the horror genre was so great that 48 years later filmmakers still seem to be influenced. Psycho inspired movies like Halloween,Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street,Child'd play and many more. When I watched it for the first time a couple of months I was worried that I wouldn't appreciate it seeing as the twist is widely known. Despite knowing the twist it was still shocking and I throughly enjoyed it. The scene in which they find out the truth about Norman Bates mother still disturbs me. The star of the movie has to be Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. His performance was outstanding, especially in the scene in which he almost shows his true colours. Psycho is a true gem and in my opinion has made a valuable contribution to the horror genre. Absolutely unmissable.",10,0,0,8 November 2008
Love Actually," Love actually- filled me up with a whole lot of love
","I only watched it for the first time last might and I was very impressed. What impressed me is that there is a perfect balance between romance and comedy. I don't normally go for rom-com so I was initially sceptical about watching it but I thought that since there was nothing else on I gave it a go, glad I did.Kiera Knightley was stunning but it was Hugh Grant who stole the show as the prime minister. He provided most of the laughs, the scene in which he is forced to sing carols for the chidren was hilarious. One of my favourite romantic scene is the scene in which Kiera Knightley realises that the best man at her wedding has feelings for her. Bill Nighy was also funny and so was Rowan Atkinson. The child (who also appeared in Nanny Mcphee) was so cute. One of the best romantic comedies I have seen in many years.",9,0,1,26 December 2007
Jaws," Jaws- Classic chills
","I have very fond memories of this Spielberg classic. I watched it when I was very young and I was terrified, it still has the same impact on me to this day. Unfortunately Jaws comes under criticism nowadays. The main criticism aimed at Jaws, some viewers of today claim that the movie is disappointing because they don't see enough of the shark. Well my response to that is that that was intentional, Spielberg wanted to create scenes of false scares along with some actual ones where we as the viewers actually see the shark. That is what makes Jaws so memorable. When released it became one of highest grossing movies of the decades.Spielberg for me has conquered almost 2 decades, in the 70's there was Jaws, 80'S was E.T. and 90's was Jurrassic Park. Unfortunately he has yet to make a memorable movie of this decade. Unfortunately none of the 3 sequels could match the brilliance of the original. Classic chills from the master of entertainment.",9,1,3,6 January 2008
Halloween," Halloween- Classic chills
","I have only managed to see this classic for the first time a few weeks ago. Being made almost 30 years ago I thought the scary moments would be rather tame. Boy was I wrong. There are some great moments that sent shivers down my spine. Even the acting was great, Jamie Lee Curtis was fantastic and Donald Pleasance was superb.On the downside it can be rather slow to start but once it gets going there is no stopping it. It makes all the copycats, e.g. Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream look very tame. I can't really say it is Carpenter's best because I have not seen many of his, the only one I can remember of his is Starman (I think he made it). Halloween is the crowning achievement of the horror genre.",10,9,11,15 November 2007
Iron Man," move over Batman there's a new man in town and he rocks
","I caught this movie in my local cinema despite never reading any of the comics and I was pleasantly surprised. I had heard some pretty favourable reviews so I went to see it with pretty high expectations but it still delivered big time. For two hours I was glued to my seat completely lost in what I was watching and that hasn't happened to me in quite a while. Robert Downey Jr completely steals the show as the impulsive and slightly irresponsible Tony Stark. It is very difficult to introduce a Superhero to the big screen and provide a sound base for it's future sequels to build on but Iron man has achieved just that. Superhero movies have been frankly quite lame of late, for instance Fantastic Four,Spiderman 3,Superman Returns so Iron Man was a very pleasant surprise for me. Not every Superhero movie have good action sequences,have a good story and raise a political message and still be entertaining. I can safely say that Iron Man is the best Superhero movie since Batman Begins. I will look forward to future sequels with extreme anticipation.",8,1,3,3 July 2008
Casino Royale," Casino Royale- The rebirth of Bond
","Despite being a Bond fan I was not looking forward to Casino Royale. The first reason being Die Another Day disappointed me( the only highlight was Halle Berry coming out of the sea in a Bikini). Secondly I wasn't sure that Daniel Craig would be able to convince people as James Bond. I was however totally wrong. This Bond entry completely blew me away.What is so fascinating is that this movie goes back into Bond's past and tells us why he is what he is. Daniel Craig was totally convincing as Bond, he brought a certain ruggedness to Bond. He is one of those people who if you were walking down a dark alley and you saw him running towards you, you would turn around and start running the other way. Eva Green was fabulous as his companion.It did however take a while to start but post the airport scene (which blew me away) the movie really took off. After a series of forgettable bond entries the Bond series has been rejuvenated by Casino Royale. Coincidentally this was not the first movie to be named Casino Royale, there was a parody of the Bond movies that had the same name. Daniel Craig has breathed new life into the Bond series and has also re-established my interest in the long running franchise.",9,1,3,15 November 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," Live free and die hard- he's back and he's better
","When I first walked into the theatre I was a bit sceptical but being a big fan of the original I felt it was my duty to at least give it a go. One reason for me being sceptical was the fact that it has been 11 years since Die hard with a vengeance. I was more than pleasantly surprised. The plot was decent but it was the stunts that got me hooked into the film.Some of the stunts were just so fabulous, especially the one in the tunnel where the car goes up in the air and explodes the helicopter.This is the only Hollywood film I have seen in the cinema this year that has delivered. I thought Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer was OK, Spiderman 3 was a slight disappointment and Transformer was trash. After a very long time have I got so involved in a movie. Was it worth the wait? Hell yes!!!.",7,0,1,28 October 2007
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Star Wars- My second favourite sci-fi adventure movie
","Second only to the sequel The Empire strikes back, I prefer the sequel only because it had a tighter plot and a shocking twist. In fact I was actually late starter when it came to Star Wars, I watched it for the first time when they re-released the trilogy in 97. It would be fair to say when I watched it I was completely spellbound, for a ten year old this was movie heaven. All the characters are legendary, Han Solo,Luke Skywalker,Princess Leia, Obi Wan Kenobi and who could forget the tyrant otherwise known as Darth Vader. The plot was pretty flimsy but Star Wars is just so much fun you probably wouldn't care. Out of all the main characters Harrison Ford had the most success,going onto Raiders of the lost ark and many more blockbusters. The John Williams score is one of my favourite movie scores along with Superman and Raiders of the lost ark. Star Wars was a monumental success, a success both sequels were going to repeat. In my opinion George Lucas should have left it at three, The Phantom menace was disappointing, Attack of the clones was no better and revenge of the sith was decent. Star Wars created the summer blockbusters and movies like POTC owe Star Wars a huge debt.",8,1,2,29 May 2008
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," One of my favourite movie sequels of all time
","I first got into the trilogy when they rereleased in 1997 and I went to see it in the cinema and I was completely hooked. I prefer The Empire Strikes Back to Star Wars because there is a twist in the tale which shocked me to the core. The special effects are just so awesome that they just hold your attention. All the regulars return Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia etc but there are some new ones too, like Lando Clarissan. In my opinion George Lucas should have stopped at number 3 because it has become more of a money making machine. The Phanthom Menace was OK, Attack of the Clones was bad whilst Revenge of the Sith was an improvement. Empire Strikes Back was easily the best of the Star Wars Franchise.",9,0,1,28 October 2007
Gladiator," Gladiator - a very pleasant surprise
","I walked into the cinema not knowing how this movie was going to turn out. Right from the word go I was gripped till the end. The fight scenes were some of the best I have ever seen. Until this movie I had never seen an historical epic and this movie got me hooked on them. At almost 3 hours it may seem long but you will engrossed in the movie that time will fly by.Russell Crowe was magnificent as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix was superb. This movie is famous for having Oliver Reed's last performance, he died during the filming and some of his scenes are computer generated. Ridley Scott as the director is extremely good. One of the best movies of 2000.",8,1,2,4 November 2007
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Just as good as Raiders if not better
","I have been a fan of the Indiana Jones movies ever since I saw it as a young child and have loved them since. Raiders was very good, Temple of Doom was rather disappointing(except for the casting of Bollywood veteran Amrish Puri) but The Last Crusade matches the brilliance the Raiders and even exceeds it. First of all there was the casting of former Bond actor Sean Connery as Indy's father(actually Julian Glover was also associated with Bond, he came in For Your Eyes Only). The Last Crusade is pretty much one great stunt after another but it is so breathtaking you can't help but be completely awestruck by it. There is even a decent enough plot, which nowadays gets forgotten in fun summer flicks of today. It's opening sequence is probably the best out of the entire franchise. It is even laced with some humour. The Last Crusade was released in 89, the year of the big movies, Ghostbusters 2,Batman,Honey I shrunk the kids but The Last Crusade held its own and was a huge success. Then in 2008 my worst nightmare was confirmed, the release of Kingdom of the lost skulls which had none of the brilliance of the original If only Mr Spielberg had left it at three and had not made Kingdom,which added nothing to the franchise other than to make a few thousand more dollars for Mr Spielberg.",9,0,1,11 December 2008
Jurassic Park," The best movie about Dinosaurs ever made
","I have such fond memories of this Spielberg classic. I saw it with my Dad and my younger sister in 93 when it first released, at the time I had seen nothing like it. It was a very expensive movie to make, a lot of money was spent not only on the superb special effects but also the merchandising(the books,the toys etc). It was money well spent, Jurrasic Park went on to make millions and millions(it is in the top 10 grossers ever). The special effects were way ahead of it's time, the Dinosaurs looked so real and terrifying. I watched Jurrasic Park a couple of weeks ago and realised it holds up remarkably well,special effects have advanced since 93 yet the special effects for Jurrasic Park still look great. Adapted from a Micheal Chriction novel(which is also superb) it tells the story of people who visit a Dinosaur theme park and how their lives are put in danger during a blackout when the Dinosaurs escape. Spielberg put in some great moments of tension, for instance in the scene where they are sitting in the jeeps and the glass in the front of the jeep starts to vibrate is absolute genius. I love the part in the end where they are going back in the helicopter and there is that shot of the bird which reminds us how the Dinosaurs have evolved.",8,2,4,9 February 2009
The Godfather," 'I am going to make him an offer he can't refuse'
","Adapted from a Mario Puzo novel, The Godfather has had the most extreme change in views for me, until a couple of weeks I despised it but that was before I rewatched it and now I love it. I think my hate for it was based on when I first saw it at the age of about 16, I really wasn't mature to appreciate the sheer beauty of The Godfather. When released it became of the biggest grossing movies of the 70's and it's no hard to see why. There are so many great aspects of The Godfather. The characters are just so well etched out. The story centres around the Corleone family who are involved with the underworld and their fight to gain supremacy of the underworld over a couple of decades. There is Don Corleone, who maybe an underworld figure but is a man of principle. An example of that is in the scene where he refuses to start selling drugs. Then there is Sonny,who is a far more ruthless man than his father. Micheal, who is the good son is working towards a respectable career. Their worlds turn upside down when Don is almost killed by rival. Sonny takes over the family business and wants revenge. Micheal gets his hands dirty by gunning down the rival(in the famous restaurant scene). Micheal is forced to flee the country so that he can avoid going to jail. Sonny is then eventually killed by rivals and Micheal is forced to run the business. After a few murders Micheal becomes as much of a ruthless mobster as his deceased brother Sonny. What is so remarkable is how family life and business life are intertwined so beautifully. In the beginning at the wedding for instance when they decide to do favours for their guests. All the leads were extraordinary,my personal favourite being Marlon Brando as Don Corleone. There are very few movies that can still shock audiences thirty years after they were first released, The Godfather is one of those rare movies. The scene in which a producer finds his beloved horse in bed with him was deeply disturbing. The Godfather I believe stands heads and shoulders above any Gangster movies because The Godfather is not just about the Mafia, it's also about family. I think most of the credit for the Godfather should go to Francis Ford Coppola. I regard The Godfather to be one of the most remarkable and iconic movies ever made and all the people involved with it should be applauded. Highly recommended to lovers of classic cinema.",10,7,12,13 November 2008
