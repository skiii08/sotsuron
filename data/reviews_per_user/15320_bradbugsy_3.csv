Source Code," Very well done
","Wasn't expecting it to be this good. Well thought out interesting plot that entertains in a uniquely scripted way. Was kind of expecting a cookie cutter film but was very surprised at how good it was and that I hadn't heard more about this movie. I guess Jake G just doesn't have the mega pull of some other Hollywood heavyweights, but he did a great job here",9,0,1,3 January 2020
Gone Baby Gone," Who thought of this?
",The acting is good. The story is very much lacking movie material. Its basically looking at society as extremely troubled with no hope. I really don't know why anyone would turn this story into a movie script.,5,0,3,4 January 2020
Cinderella Man," A really well constructed film
",Great movie- the story is played out beautifully with fantastic performances by Crowe and Zelwiger and Paul Giamatti (spelling?) was fantastic. I would wholeheartedly recommend this one for boxing fans and history buffs as well as just fans of cinema. Enjoy,10,1,1,3 January 2020
