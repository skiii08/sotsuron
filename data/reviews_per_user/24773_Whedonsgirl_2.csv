United 93," Takes you right back to that day
","The United 93 takes you right back to Semptember 11th 2001. The day the U.S. was attacked. It takes you behind the scenes to air traffic control and shows you a real time play-by-play of what happened that morning. It takes you onto that fourth plane. I could feel the fear of the people on that plane like I was living it. Very moving, Very compelling. They hide nothing from you in this movie. The director did a fantastic job in making a movie from the little information he had about what went on on that plane. I strongly suggest watching this movie, however you may not want to fly on any planes for a long while afterwards.",10,9,19,28 April 2006
Click," Horrid.
","This movie is the worst Adam Sandler movie yet. Like most movies in this generation (which is hard for me to say since I am part of this new generation) this movie was crammed full with inappropriate jokes.Take your pick. Sex,farts,groin kicks,boobs, man-boobs and bowel movements. Its all in there. The writing is so predictable at times you can almost say the line before they do. Sandler's over the top acting is alright when it comes to comedy but he is sorely lacking when it comes to drama.The only positive aspect is Kate Beckinsale who do any part well. You can see the ending coming before you even start the beginning. Utterly predictable, this Christmas carol-esquire story leaves much to be desired.",1,15,35,15 September 2006
