The Blair Witch Project," A Good Film.
","Okay, lets get one thing straight - The Blair Witch Project is not scary until the last 45 minutes and can kind of boring at the start....but it definitely catches your attention!When Heather, Mike and Josh tramp deep into the woods of Maryland, Burkittsville they get lost and unfortunately their is a scary witch stalking them!! Heather, Mike and Josh tape basically everything they do and that peices together The Blair Witch Project which is this film.My rating - 9/10.",9,1,2,28 April 2000
Alien 3," Sheesh!
",Alien3 has got graphic blood and guts and is pretty damn terrifying! It is also unrealistic. Alien3 has great special effects and reasonably good acting.There is seriously nothing else to say about this movie apart from the fact that I recommend it. One of the best in the Alien series - no jokes!My rating - 8/10.,8,0,3,28 April 2000
Erin Brockovich," Totally Unmissable.
","I had wanted to see Erin Brockovich since I first saw it advertise. I was expecting a really good film. I was wrong - this film is better than good. It is sexy, amusing, dramatic and popular. Definitely the best film of 2000 so far. And I can't believe it was based on a true story! Erin Brockovich did absolutely great things. JULIA ROBERTS is amazing. Her best role, she is awesome, sexy, powerful - a total powerhouse performance for her in this film. Roberts plays Erin Brockovich, a fiesty yet nice person who is desperate for a job so she can feed her 3 lovely children. When she finds one, she see's that the water safety in her small town is not good and there begins the marvellous story that is 'Erin Brockovich'My no. 10 movie. My rating : Obviously 10/10.Don't miss it!",10,1,1,12 May 2000
As Good as It Gets," Great.
","I didn't like this film so much the first time I saw it, but now I adore it! As Good as It Gets is excellent, it has a great cast of actors, a funny script and a great director.This film is too hard to explain and If I told you what it was about you probably wouldn't enjoy as much. I just tell you something, think a repulsive, rude, crude and clean-cut man who writes romance books on a trip with two emotional dudes!!As Good As It Gets would definitely be on my Top 100 films. It is excellent!!",9,0,0,5 May 2000
Seven Years in Tibet," Excellent.
","If you can, please email me and tell me something wrong with this film. Brad Pitt is excellent, the cinematography is amazing, the story is great, the photography is stunning, it is brilliantly directed and has a beautiful nature. All of you out there who didn't like this film, you must agree with what I just said!Seven Years In Tibet isn't just about a Dalai Lama and another man's relationship, it is a touching story. The film is very hard to explain, so you'll just have to see it for yourself.This film is definitely on my Top 100.",8,3,5,5 May 2000
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Brilliant!!!!!
","This is one of the coolest movies I have ever seen in my whole entire life! The songs are awesome, you'll crack up laughing at everything your supposed to and this film has a great storyline!If you hate swearing, are sensitive and could smash South Park - this film definitely isn't for you. But for those people who like laughing at themselves, have fun and could f**k South Park - this is definitely for you!In this verrrrrrryyyyy long episode of South Park, Stan and his mates go to see the Terrance and Philip movie. Terrance and Philip encourage the boys to swear by singing a cool song called Shut your f***ing face uncle f***er and the boys cause a war! Uh-oh.My rating : 10/10.",10,0,0,29 April 2000
Elizabeth," Excellent.
","I don't know about anyone else but I reckon Elizabeth should of won Best Film in 1999. I know - Shakespeare In Love is a cool movie, but Elizabeth has that little spark that makes it alot better. Elizabeth has an excellent cast including Cate Blanchett, Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey Rush, Richard Attenborough and Christopher Eccleston. Cate Blanchett is amazing, Joseph Fiennes is excellent and Richard Attenborough is good as always. Elizabeth is definitely a 'must-see' for people who haven't seen it, and if you haven't, you should go and rent it a.s.a.p.My no. 14 movie. My rating : 10/10.",10,0,2,13 May 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Definitely The Best Film Of 1999.
","Sleepy Hollow (If I have already done a review on this movie, too bad, I will just do another one!)This movie is definitely the best movie of 1999, and can overgo any 1998 movies as well! Sleepy Hollow is dramatic, scary, funny, fulled with mystery and also action packed. It is the best movie since 'Titanic'. You can't miss it.Johnny Depp stars as a small-town counstable named Ichabod Crane, who gets sent to the small-town named Sleepy Hollow to investigate the seriously scary decapitating horseman.Co-starring Christina Ricci, Jeffrey Jones and Christopher Walken (who looks very scary in this flick!) - Sleepy Hollow is the must-see movie of 1999. Stuff American Beauty - give me Sleepy Hollow anyday!My no. 2 film. My rating : 10/10.",10,11,20,12 May 2000
10 Things I Hate About You," Excellent and Enjoyable.
","Here we have it, another awesome teen film! All the actors including Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles, Joseph Gordon Levitt and Larisa Oleynik are great!Ten Things I Hate About You (1999) is romantic, dramatic, funny and sexy - its really quite rare for people to dislike this film.
It stars Julia Stiles at Kat, who is a bitch rebel who hates guys. Thats a problem for her popular sister, Bianca who recently got a boyfriend and is desperate to go to the prom. But her dad won't let her unless Kat goes with someone. So thats were Heath Ledger steps in and all he's in for is the money, or is he?I'm sure You'll love Ten Things I Hate About You and if you do then I recommend Never Been Kissed, too.",9,0,0,28 April 2000
American Pie," One of the funniest movies of 1999.
","Be warned, American Pie is a romantic comedy with its heart in its dick, but it is throughly enjoyable and extremely hilarious.American Pie (1999) follows the story of 4 sex-obsessed teenagers who are desperate to get laid. So they make a pact that they must lose their virginity before they graduate. On the way to doing it, the guys have hilarious problems, including broadcasting themselves naked on the internet, f**king a pie and several others!American Pie is a 1999 must-see!!Oh, also, look out for Alyson Hannigan (Buffy), Tara Reid (Urban Legend, Cruel Intentions), Mena Suvari (American Beauty) and Chris Klein (Here on Earth, Election) - they are all really good actors.",10,1,2,19 April 2000
Grease," Catchy Songs but a stupid story.
","Grease's songs are awesome! They will stick in your head for all eternity and it is hard to stay in your seat and not join in the singing and dancing.But on the other hand, the story is lame and stupid. All it is is a bunch of teenagers running around, singing, dancing and falling in love.Yeah, yeah, I know it is loveable film - but seriously it doesn't really appeal to me anymore.My rating : 6 and a half / 10",Null,0,1,12 May 2000
Armageddon," Unrealistic but good film.
","Well, I must say, not many people enjoyed 'Armageddon'. Basically everybody I knew enjoyed this awesome film.Ben Affleck, Bruce Willis and Liv Tyler return to the screen to play 3 people affected by the sudden realisation that the world might come to an end if Brucy and Benny boy don't stop a big asteriod from destroying Earth! Can they do it? You'll just have to watch and find out!I love this movie, it is romantic, extremely sad, but action packed with adventure and thrills to stop you crying.Liv Tyler was amazing in this movie and I think she should of been nominated for 'Best Supporting Actress' at the Oscars for 1999.Don't miss 'Armageddon'!",8,1,1,12 May 2000
The Exorcist," The Funniest Film of 1973.
","I have no idea why this is matched under the horror genre. It is pure comedy, and black comedy it is too. I mean with quotes like 'Let Jesus Fuck You', 'Lick Me!', 'Your Mother Sucks Cocks In Hell' and several other demon words, how can you be scared? I found myself giggling through the whole film. Of course, you've heard it is disgusting, which is true. But horror is wrong.Okay, been a black comedy does not stop this film from been good at all. It is genuinely a masterpiece and one of the greatest horror films of all time. - See it!",9,0,2,2 June 2000
The Little Mermaid," The Best Animated Movie I Have Ever Seen.
","The voices are great, the story is terrific, the songs are better than words and the animation is perfect. The best animated film I have ever seen by far.Ariel is a teenage mermaid who is closely watched over by her father, King Triton. She is in love with the world above the sea and wishes to go up there one day. She loves Prince Eric from the moment she meets him, but there are some nasty tricks from the scariest monster in the sea called Ursula.I just loved it. My rating : 10/10. My no. 9 best movie.",10,0,0,13 May 2000
Good Will Hunting," Great Acting + Awesome Screenplay = Excellent Film.
","Good Will Hunting deserves alot more praise than it gets. It only received 2 Academy Awards - it earned about 4 in my opinion! Matt Damon is brilliant, Robin Williams is excellent, Minnie Driver is good, Stellan Skargaard does a great job and Ben Affleck played a strong supporting role.The film basically follows the story of Will Hunting, a rebel who one day is so bad it leads him up to trouble, and a counseller. This film is great and If you haven't seen it (highly unlikely) you should rent it from your nearest video store A.S.A.P.This is definitely in my Top 120.",9,1,4,5 May 2000
Good Will Hunting," Excellent Film.
","Good Will Hunting stars Matt Damon as Will Hunting, a rebel who gets counselled to find his innerself.Matt Damon and Robin Williams both deserve Oscars for this film - it has excellent actors, a great story, an excellent script and good cinematography.You can't go past Good Will Hunting - I give it 10/10, 2 Oscars, 2 thumbs up and a place in my Top 120.",9,1,4,5 May 2000
Toy Story 2," Way Better Than The Original.
","Like alot of movies, I hated this movie's guts when I first saw it, but now I love it. Who said sequels where never better? Think about it....I Still Know is better than I Know and Toy Story 2 is better than Toy Story.Toy Story 2 is much funnier and way more enjoyable than the original. I was laughing so much my sides hurt! - also it had more loveable characters and was suitable for adults and children. I know Toy Story must sound really bad now if you haven't seen it (which I doubt) - but Toy Story is also a very good film.In this sequel, Woody gets stolen by a toy-lover and you guessed it....Buzz and his mates are the one's who must rescue him...but soon everyone will need rescuing! Look out for Rex - he rocks!
My rating : 10/10.",10,0,1,29 April 2000
Scream 2," A Top 10 Movie.
","Everyone looks better, another sexy cast returns and it is most enjoyable! - SCREAM 2 of course! You can't go past this movie, it is too cool, too funny, too thrilling and too scary! You just can't miss it!It includes a powerful and awesome cast including Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Jerry O Connell, Liev Schreiber, Laurie MetCalf, Jamie Kennedy, Timothy Olyphant, Elise Neal, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jada Pinkett, Omar Epps, Rebecca Gayheart, Portia DeRoosi, Duane Martan and Joshua Jackson! Wow! You have to agree with me that that is quite an impressive cast!Sidney Prescott (Campbell) has moved to Windsor, a lovely small town. Sidney has a new boyfriend, a new life and is a well-known student at Windsor College. Everything is good and well until there is another killer on the loose! Now everyone is a suspect, there is a killer making more calls and even more kills!Neve Campbell is the best part of this movie - she is the sexiest she has ever been!My rating : 10/10.",10,0,0,5 May 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," One Of The Best Movies I Have Ever Seen.
","Morgan Freeman at his absolute best, Tim Robbins - better than ever - it must be a good film!!The Shawshank Redemption grabs you tight and pulls you into its depth and drama. It is definitely worth a look if you haven't seen it.This film shows the story of how hope can set you free. It is a beautiful film with excellent actors, an good story and shocking (but excellent) dialouge. The Shawshank Redemption definitely deserves it's place as my no. 5 favourite film and IMDb's no. 3 user rated film.My rating : Obviously 10/10.",10,0,0,10 May 2000
The Iron Giant," Excellent.
","Totally a joy to watch, The Iron Giant follows the story of young Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marenthal) - a little boy who has nothing to do. Then he hears about a huge metal machine falling from the sky. He goes and searches. And of course, trouble finds him. But love, friendship and redemption also find him and he befriends an Iron Giant.This film has excellent animation, great voices and cool direction. Don't miss it!The Iron Giant would definitely be on my top 30.My rating : 10/10.",10,1,2,19 May 2000
The Sixth Sense," My 3rd Favourite Film Of All Time.
","The Sixth Sense totslly blew me away! It is scary, dramatic, awesome and packed with thrills to keep you on the edge of your seat!
You'll love Haley Joel Osment as Cole Sear (who deserves Best Supporting Actor and an Outstanding Acheievement Award) a 9 year old boy with a problem - he can see dead people! Can child-psycholigst Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis - who also deserves an Oscar) help him with his problem and make the living-dead go away?Don't miss this awesome film!My rating : 10/10.",10,0,0,28 April 2000
Tarzan," Disney's worst movie in a long time.
","Oh come on, get real - I have heard comments like 'Walt would of been proud' and 'This film is great for the family!' - well here is one 'This movie sucks!!' - get it through your head people, we are not interested in seeing a skinny man raised by monkeys running around the bush and falling in love! Boring!This film is a total pass for me, and I don't even need to explain the story because of course, you probably know what it is about.Disappointing and gay. Through it in the bin!!My rating : 2/10.",2,0,17,12 May 2000
The Wedding Singer," Great Entertainment.
","The Wedding Singer is like one of those movies you can watch over and over again and you can never be bored or never stop loving the film.The Wedding Singer is hilarious and romantic and has lots of nice 80's touches. The Story : Robbie (Adam Sandler) is a wedding singer who has just been dissed and dismissed at his own wedding. He always does a great singing job...until now. That is until he meets Julia (Drew Barrymore - great in this one), a good-natured waitress who happens to be engaged to a guy who smokes and is an alcoholic. What is Robbie gonna do about that?A cool flick you can't resist. My rating : 9/10.",8,1,1,13 May 2000
