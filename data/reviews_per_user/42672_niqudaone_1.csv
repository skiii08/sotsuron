It," sucked
","why does everybody keep saying the IT MOVIE was so freaking good & scary...like did we even watch the same dang movie...wasn't at all scary...pennywise sucked, wasn't scary, was gaunt & funny looking, sounded horable & non scary & was more clownish(the actor was coming across silly/funny but not scary...in a bad haha this is so bad kind of way)..the young kids were amateurish the whole movie seemed amateurish & it was not remotely better then the made for TV movie...I thought it would be better & scarier then it was.",1,5,14,15 September 2017
