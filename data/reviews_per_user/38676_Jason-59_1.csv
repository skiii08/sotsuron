The Blair Witch Project," The scariest movie I have seen
","If you are looking for a scary movie and you haven't been scared for a while I recommend this movie. By the virtue of the filming technique it creates an air of believability that you can't shake throughout. I have never been so scared in a theater before. The cast is awesome and the story is believable. Move over Stephen King.The entire movie sustains this feeling that you are with the campers in the movie, and you are as scared as they are. When they lose hope and cry you lose hope and cry. I honestly believed this movie the entire way through, with the possible exception of the end shot.Rolling Stone called it what it is: 'Scary as Hell'",8,1,3,29 April 1999
