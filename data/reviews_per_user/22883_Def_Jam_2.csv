The Blair Witch Project," It sucks
","Most of the time, I don't care about the budget of a movie. The movie costs 60,000 dollars, according to some people. Well,somebody is walking around with 59,000 dollars in his/her pocket, like Chris Rock would say it. When the girl screamed 'What is that?!' you couldn't see nothing. The 'that' is nothing. So it really stink!",3,0,1,14 September 1999
The Mummy," It is nice
",It is a good mixture of humor and action. I learned about it too. Now I know some legends. I'm planning to visit Egypt anyway. The humor parts are good cuz it keeps you from being bored and throwing pop corn. Nice and I stayed awake the entire movie.,8,0,0,31 August 1999
