Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," MOTHER OF YODA!!!!!!!!
","Yoda owns your a**.  Nuff said.  I was cheering throughout the movie, Anakin was damn scary and you can see the evil in him beginning to germinate. Very eerie.  The audience cheered at 'the crawl' and at the end.  The biggest cheers were for Yoda and deservedly so.  He SO brings it.  I feel so much better now after reading all the 'critics' pan it.  They have a couple of things in common.....they're OLD or they're women who don't like starwars anyway.  I'm going to see it again tomorrow.  I will make a concession tho.......I snickered at the 'sound of music' frolick in the grass.......hey nobody's perfect..............Can't wait 3 years for E:III!!!!!!",10,1,2,16 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," This Movie Was INCREDIBLE!!!!!!
","Now, I haven't read The Lord of the Rings.  After seeing this first installment, though, I rushed to Border's and bought all 3 volumes.  Where do I begin?  For a Tolkien-illiterate such as myself, I couldn't have asked for a better primer on the world of Middle Earth.  The introduction was terrific and set the story in place.  From there on, I was lost for 3 hours in this magical world.  All the lush, sweeping landscapes......the magical creatures.......the battles........almost everything left me on the edge of my seat.  Even the dialogue kept me interested......revealing little secrets about the characters unbeknownst to me(don't worry I won't spoil it for you!!)  This movie is the template from which many other high-profile, over-hyped pieces should take a note from......see Harry Potter.....I can't wait another year for the next one....but I have to.  If you're thinking that 3 hours is too long to spend sitting in one place watching a movie, let me just say it will be the best 3 hours you'd spend seeing a movie in many years.  THIS is what great storytelling is all about........Thank you, Peter Jackson!!!!!",10,0,0,19 December 2001
