Walk the Line," Superb Acting!
","The film 'Walk the Line' is superb. The storyline is great. The leading Actor did an Oscar Winning performance. It was also sad in a lot of area, especially in the scene where Johnny Cash's first wife is on the floor. Even though according to the film June Carter helped Johnny Cash get off drugs, his first wife would have been supportive if given the chance. I did not know that June Carter wrote the song 'Ring of Fire,' so I learned something by watching the film. I liked the scene where it started out with Johnny Cash as a child. I love films that display the childhood of famous people, because it helps to understand why they became the legend that they were destined to become.",10,2,6,18 November 2005
