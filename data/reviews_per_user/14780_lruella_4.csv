First Man," boring dull melancholy boring and dull
","Script is boring, pacing is boring, acting is incredibly boring, everyone lookin so emotionless and melancholic all the time, zero chemistry between actors, shaky camera, boring boring boring.",1,1,4,21 November 2018
The Babadook," A few entertaining parts but quite a failure in the end.
","First mistake a movie should avoid is making the audience hate the protagonists.The kid behaves like a whiny little brat and the mother is unable to exert any discipline or have him seen by a therapist despite him building a WORKING DARTH SHOOTING CROSSBOW in primary school. Everybody, including her own sister, hates them, rightly so.Please note that the WORKING CROSSBOW never gets disposed of by the mother but is inexplicably left in the hands of the child.Weird stuff starts happening almost immediately, killing any building of suspense.Character development is quite superficial. What she is doing in her life is merely hinted at, as is her relationship with the old woman. Only thing we know is that the dad died in a car crash. How this is functional to the story, I have no idea.Also why is the babadook book in that specific house? What are its origins? Why is it haunting this family? How exactly do they defeat him? What were is intentions and why? The movie does not bother to elaborate over ANY of this crucial points. And some OLD tricks are so predictable. Flickering lights and the old-as-the world trick of destroying the cursed item only to find it intact back in place.",3,2,9,15 August 2015
Dunkirk," A step back not only from Private Ryan but even from Pear Harbour
","The facts:<ul><li>No emotional attachment to any of the shallow characters. What are the names of the various protagonists? Dunno.</li></ul>-The scale of this historical event, which should be comparable to D- Day is terribly depicted. The entire operation is run by 3 (three) airplanes, a handful of small boats and some hundred men on the beach.<ul><li>Three insignificant and repetitive story lines: let's escape from the beach, dogfight, sunk ship, crashed airplane, repeat until you reach 2 hours of movie.</li></ul><ul><li>In the whole movie there is barely a drop of blood. Not a wound, not a bleeding, not a severed limb despite the soldiers being bombarded several times on an open field. Ridiculous. The graphic revolution started with Private Ryan is forgotten. The bombing scenes are less captivating and tense than Pearl Harbour.</li></ul>A disappointing movie in terms of script, acting and technical filming.One more demonstration that online ratings in 2017 are utterly useless.",1,23,41,31 July 2017
Arrival," I really don't understand the good reviews. Everybody in the cinema was bored to death
","This movie left everybody in the cinema clueless and bored to death.So many things in the movie make ZERO sense, just a few examples:<ul><li>The colonel expects the linguist to decipher some alien language that sounds like gwowodkgjdkgrowlhwkas on the spot from a dicta phone.</li></ul><ul><li>Most important event in humankind and all decisions are taken by some random soldiers in the camp. President of the US or any politicians are never shown and take no role whatsoever in the story.</li></ul><ul><li>Some 'rogue' soldier (god knows how) gets his hands on explosives, avoids all controls, and expects to destroy with a few C4 charges a huge spaceship which defies the laws of physics.</li></ul><ul><li>The way they 'decipher' the alien random scrabbling are just completely arbitrary and laughable (aka there is no explanation on how anything is deciphered) but magically after a few months they have a full vocabulary with which they can have a conversation. In real history many real human languages based on actual letters (not random stains in the air) were a completely unintelligible until the Rosetta Stone was found with a key to understand them.</li></ul><ul><li>The alien presence on earth is just nonsensical. They arrive, say that they have bought some 'gift' to humanity because in 3000 years they will need help in return (for what?) and then they disappear in thin air without having accomplished anything.</li></ul><ul><li>The attack by the Chinese general (again, no government exists, it seems that soldier can just do what the heck the want) is stopped by some phone call whose contents nobody bothers to explain.</li></ul><ul><li>most of the movie is just going back and forth from the ship, zzzzzzzzzz</li></ul><ul><li>The physicist is practically useless. He just sits around without giving any scientific contribution. His only role is to represent the love interest of the linguist. He could have been a janitor for all I know.</li></ul>People saying that this is the best movie ever have probably never seen a movie in their life or have suffered a concussion. Proof of this is that, while we're still talking about 2001 a space odyssey after 40 years, in 3 months nobody will remember this onsensical, boring, badly written piece of garbage.",1,1814,3577,15 November 2016
