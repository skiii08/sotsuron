Casablanca," Greatest Film on Earth
","Wow! The first time I watched Casablanca in school. But I didn't get to see all of it. So I rented it and watched it at least 5 times in one night. It's so great and I just love Ingrid Bergman playing Ilsa Lund. Her appearance and her lines. My favorite line of her: 'You know how much I loved you, how much I still love you' But in general I think this movie just rocks the cinema. I have seen it once on the big screen and it was so different from watching it on TV. I bought that film in two versions (english+german) and I'm planning on buying it in italian, too. I can only say that it's the best movie I've ever seen and that it's my favorite one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Bergman's the best!",10,2,2,10 November 2002
