Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," If you agree it was bad, don't give it a 9 out of 10
","I'm just posting to see how many stars IMDb says I gave it. I gave it 1 star. Really, it deserved at least 3, but I read many reviews that basically said, 'Come on, it wasn't ALL terrible' and gave it 8 to 10 stars. Come on, kids. Does your dial go to 11? Also, I noticed that whenever people gave it a rating within their review, the number of stars shown before their review was different - sometimes lower, but usually higher.I knew this movie would suck when I saw the previews, because they had nothing but CGI scenes, with no dialogue. That told me where Lucas' mind was, and that tells you everything you need to know about this movie.",1,0,2,23 June 2005
Crash," Racism is not our God
","Though some parts, taken by themselves, are quite good, the movie is stupid and damaging taken as a whole. This movie spends its entire length beating the viewer over the head with one message, and that one message is: Everything that happens, happens because of racial prejudice. That is the only motive behind any human action.This is only made worse by the simplistic, extremist, overt notion the filmmakers had of what racism is.I'd complain more about the number of astonishing coincidences the plot requires, but that's a trivial problem by comparison.",3,1,4,25 January 2020
