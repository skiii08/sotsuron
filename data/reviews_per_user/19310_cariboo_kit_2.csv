",I came to this movie expecting a great boxing film. Hah. There isn't that much boxing in this movie. The movie's plot jumps in many places. There are a lot of holes in this film. The acting wasn't all that bad but whoever wrote this screwed up somewhere. 'Ali' doesn't even capture Muhammed Ali's story correctly.

",I thought when i rented this movie i was renting another 'teen' movie. I found it to be in a completely different class. I thought the acting was great. I found myself at the end caring for the characters. I like it when you get really 'into' a movie that when it ends you're like 'awww its over'.I was really surprised by what a great job Chris Marquette and Paul Dano did as Eli and Klitz. They were hilarious. Elisha Cuthbert was hot as usual. People watching this movie expecting to see her nude will be disappointed. I found her to be that much more sexy by not taking it all off. The extras on the DVD were cool. (Yeah i bought it). People's opinions vary on this film. I'm a young guy and found it excellent. One of my favorite films of 2004. If thats saying much. Great film.10/10,10,0,0,25 October 2004
