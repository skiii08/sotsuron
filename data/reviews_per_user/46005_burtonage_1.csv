Skyfall," This is not a bond movie
","Please read the other reviews that aren't 10/10 and see what people say. I'd say it's pretty true. The movie had great stunts and action that you would expect, but this is NOT a bond movie. There's no gadgets, no beautiful women, no cars. None of that. And most importantly, there's no wit and sophistication on Bond's part. That's what really makes Bond Bond. In this movie, Craig is a lousy, drunkard who also happens to be a terrible shot.Among all that, there was no reason behind some of the plot twists that were included. Things were redundant. I hope this is isn't a spoiler, but there's one gadget that's in the movie, and it doesn't get the use that was expected. The plot is not linear and there are a lot of holes in the development of the story.Bond needs to be a sophisticated, intelligent, babe-magnet super agent. He needs to have some gadgets and a nice car. The movie needs to be cheesy at times, but not completely illogical.",3,11,24,10 November 2012
