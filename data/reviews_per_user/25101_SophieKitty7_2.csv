Alien 3," Not as scary as the first one
","So, im a person who usually gets scared of every single little thing, in the first movie i had to open a chat nearby to feel a little less scared (getting my mind off the scary stuff) lol the 2nd was a bit less and the 3rd i was able to watch fully without that, not even one jumpscare, no scary moments, nothing, the movie didnt seem to actually have much suspense or anything, quite lame ._.the idea wasnt the worst, but i feel it could have been so much better if they put more time into it...
also the alien looked like *insert curse word here* compared to the first 2 movies where they were soooo awesome and perfect, it was such bad CGI that even that 2000s godzilla movie looks great compared to thatBUT
storywise it may have been a good successor, its worth watching if you go through the whole movie list of alien",7,2,2,8 December 2018
Super 8," Fun movie but
","The story was interesting, kids finding something out by mistake, being the only ones who knew other sides of the story, yea fineProblem was that usually movies give the point of the movie before half the movie is through, they usually know what they are fighting or what they are supposed to findbut in this?
I was waiting for the kids to get superpowers throughout most of the movie (mainly because of the movie name......)While those kids looked like they achieved this and that, in reality NONE of what they did, impact the ending even a little bit, it would have ended the exact same way if they were gone!
That alien was building the machine throughout the movie without anyone noticing, in the end the kids were just close enough to witness the machine being turned on, within a minute the spaceship got built through that machine, and it flew off, the kids had nothing to do with the outcome of the movie, it really bugs meSuperpowers i thought a bit too because a little car was able to stop and derail a huge heavy military train, and the driver of that car didnt even die from all those train-wagons exploding and flying around (and of course the most obvious, the impact with the train), because of that i thought that he had superpowers and couldnt die so fast... hoped for whatever was in the trainwreck, to come out, infect the kids with superpowers and THAT would be interesting xDBUT
all in all, the movie was still fun to watch, a little scarier/darker than some other action movies, but not enough to be a horror movie (even though there is 2-3 jumpscares and some scary silence at times making you expect a jumpscare)
Monster scariness comparable to... the fish from The Host, cant think of another example for now.If you dont mind a movie where the main characters only work as 'Watchers' and 'Explainers' of what happens, then go on watch the movie, its good",7,0,2,4 June 2018
