The Avengers," Super Heroes, Less Than Super Movie
","This movie just did not do it for me. The movie was a box office hit: it made $623,279,547 in the United States alone, and is third on the list of top grossing films of all time. However, a movie's earnings do not suggest it was a great film. Obviously the concept was a hit: comic book superheroes converging to save earth and fight interstellar enemies. I just think the movie was flat, though. I myself am not a comic book enthusiast, so I do not personally care for superheroes and the sort, but the movie itself just seemed so bland. The characters actions seemed forced and there was just too much action for the movie to have any sort of depth. Of course, there had to be action, since they are superheroes, but I just felt like so much more could have been done with the film. I did not think the actors did very well, either. I think it was just the film, though: most of them are great actors. Crossovers and ensemble character films usually do not do well, and this film is a prime example. It was bland, predictable, and lacking in many fields, such as character depth and plot. Maybe it is just my own aversion to comic book films, specifically Marvel ones (I did not even like Guardians... shoot me now!), but I think many would agree with me in saying this summer blockbuster was severely underwhelming. There was nothing 'Incredible', 'Mighty', or 'Iron' about it.",5,3,7,10 October 2014
