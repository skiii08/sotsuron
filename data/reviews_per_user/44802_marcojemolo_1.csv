Blade Runner 2049," Stunning imagery, non-sense story...
","Maybe it is just me and I need to re-watch the film to better understand what it is about, but honestly, at first sight, I had the feeling of a story with a whole bunch of loose ends leading nowhere. SPOILERS AHEAD!!!1) The inciting incident of the whole story is agent K finding a date carved on a tree in a replicant's backyard. The same date appears in K's memory carved in a wooden horse. Basically, in order to mislead the police and hide Deckard's daughter, someone (WHO?) implanted her memory in a random replicant brain. That random replicant came to be agent K who, by coincidence, is ALSO a Blade Runner and is ALSO the guy that finds the carved tree. A bit of a stretch for anyone, innit? 2) The covenant of rebel replicants. Really? Is there anything more generic than a Matrix-like secret society that appears in one scene only with the only purpose of exposure? 3) What exactly is Mr. Wallace after? Isn't it just the same thing the Replicant Covenant *SIGH* and agent K want? Can't they team up instead kicking each other's ass for no reason?What I really, really loved is K, Joi and Luv. Beautiful characters built on very soft story grounds. And, naturally, when Villeneuve, Deakins and 300mil are put together, the eye is treated right. Too bad good framing does not make a film!",4,6,11,23 November 2017
