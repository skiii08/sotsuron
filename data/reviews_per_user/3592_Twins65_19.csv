Moneyball," I guess starting pitching and Miguel Tejeda really didn't matterjust give me a team of Hattebergs, Mabrys & Bradfords and we'll win 100 games?!?
","First off, I've never read the book. I am really familiar with it, as it's been talked about pretty much non-stop in baseball circles since it came out, but I don't know how much starting pitching was addressed on the page. I'd like to also consider myself well versed in the thinking of Bill James and his ideas on winning baseball. Hell, I think I bought one of his Bill James Abstracts almost 25 years ago, so his whole OBS strategy is fully ingrained in my consumption of winning baseball.That being stated, and even though I'm pretty sure this has to have been touched on already, how the hell can the stellar 2002 Oakland A's starting pitching BE COMPLETELY IGNORED in this movie? Their top three starters (Tim Hudson, Barry Zito & Mark Mulder) collectively went 57-21, with 675 combined innings and ERA just under 3.0. And this was at the height of baseball's so-called STEROID ERA!! Granted, starting pitchers' win-loss records at times can be somewhat misleading, as you need consistent run support, solid defense, and great relief pitching to end up with a winning % like that. Still, these guys solidly pitched approx. 46% of the A's innings for the SEASON in which they won 103 games, and weren't mentioned here at all. I guess they did show the back of Hudson's jersey once, as he was the starter in that wild game where they won their 20th straight, but that's it! Zito even won the AL Cy Young Award in 2002, which helped him eventually procure a ridiculous contract from SF which he'll never come close to living up to, but I digress.Anyway, the movie-makers decided to only champion the role-players, who in fairness, really stepped up and delivered solid seasons. But Tejeda's MVP season ('performance enhanced or not') was also ignored. You can't ignore a shortstop who plays all 162 games, hits .308 with 34 homers and 131 ribbies!! YOU JUST CAN'T!! All said, MONEYBALL is a well-made movie which ultimately came up short, just like the A's did in 2002.",6,0,0,5 September 2012
Se7en," 20+ years later, I watched it again
","...and it was STILL STELLAR! Fincher's mid-90's crime drama SE7EN got a whole bunch of hype when it first came out, and deservedly so. Pitt was still on the upswing of his career, 'Gwyn' was still not yet a household name (which was a good thing for this role), and of course Freeman was at the top of his game (see SHAWSHANK, UNFORGIVEN, OUTBREAK, etc.) once again playing the voice of reason to perfection. And throw in Spacey, who was still in the last stages of being a THAT GUY (albeit, one of the very best THAT GUYS-- he would pick up a Supporting Actor Oscar the next year for THE USUAL SUSPECTS), and you've got one helluva cast.But it wouldn't have all mattered if the story wasn't any good, and this one, written by Andrew Kevin Walker, is top notch. I guess my only real beef is that we wait too long until we actually get involved visually with Spacey's John Doe. But once he shows, the movie is even more riveting down the stretch. The chase scene and then finally the car ride scene are tremendous, as is the final showdown which I won't spoil here but I think every movie buff is familiar with by now.WATCH IT AGAIN WHEN YOU CAN!",9,3,4,13 March 2017
The Big Lebowski," The rug really ties the room together!
","As bowling movies go (and fortunately there aren't many), I think we have to admit that The Big Lebowski has it all over Kingpin (which itself was pretty good).  The Dude, Walter, Donny, Brandt, Maude, Bunny, Jesus, and even The Stranger & The Nihilists are all very memorable characters, and you'll laugh pretty much all the way through. The Coen brothers have made some great flicks, but this one's the best.",10,1,1,28 May 2002
Green Room," Sinister PurposeINDEED!
","...Knockin' at your door. Great song to end the movie, by the way.This was a quick watch, which was just fine with me. I don't know whether or not to classify it as a 'horror movie' or a 'gore movie', but it was effective and exciting. My one real complaint is I couldn't really see ANYTHING well outside of the green room scenes, in the drug lab and/or the day after scenes.But Mr. Saulnier has delivered once again (after 'Blue Ruin'), and I'm going to check out his earlier movie 'Murder Party' ASAP.P.S.-R.I.P. Anton. 27 years old and a solid career of over 15 years in the movies. You will be missed.",7,0,2,23 December 2016
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," 'Who Are Those Guys'?
","The 'blueprint' for every buddy movie you've seen in the last 35 years...The recent passing of director George Roy Hill prompted me to revisit this classic.  I checked it out with and without the commentary on a DVD, and it was just fine either way.  Just good old-fashioned American movie making, something you can watch with your kids and not worry about anything too embarrassing cropping up (save for the hot scene where Sundance gets back with Ms. Ross-who never looked better). Nothing too revealing came out of the DVD interviews with Newman and Redford from the early nineties, but it seemed like a nice trip down memory lane for both them and me.   However, Redford did seem to really enjoy the scene where Butch kicked Ted Cassidy ('Lurch') in a 'very sensitive area'!",Null,2,5,29 April 2003
Fargo," You should see the other guy!!
","The Coens really deserved all the accolades they received for this, as it's among their best efforts.  After all the critically acclaimed, commercial disappointments they've produced, it was nice to see them break through and triumph in both areas for once.This movie will certainly stand the test of time, as I recently watched it again and enjoyed it thoroughly.  The acting is phenomenal, even if I was a little skeptical at first of the accents portrayed by 'residents' of my home state.  Oh well, I'll sure I'll be laughing again the next time I graze at a smorgasbord when I'm back there.Can someone tell my how Steve Buscemi has never even been nominated for an Academy Award, let alone never won one?  The guy's been in a zillion movies and never ceases to amaze.Also, William H. Macy should have been in the Best Actor catagory (not Supporting Actor!), and certainly deserved an Oscar as well.",Null,0,0,22 November 2002
American Beauty," I'm looking for the least possible amount of responsibility.
","There seems to be very little 'middle ground' on this one. My guess is most guys (35+) raved about it, and women aged 7 to 77 didn't. But I don't think that's entirely fair.It's definitely a 'guy flick', even though there's some great female performances. Thora Birch and Annette Bening were superb, and Alison Janney was quite memorable as a catatonic housewife. But for the most part, all the women in this movie aren't real happy, and I think that's why women just couldn't relate to 'AB'. So let's just call it a 'Thelma and Louise' for the rest of us.My hat's off to K. Spacey for his brilliant portrayal of Lester Burnham, the guy every white-collar, 40-something bean-counter wishes he could be. Who wouldn't want to...blackmail his boss, quit his job (& get a year's paid salary!), lift weights, and blow weed! Oh yeah, and also get a job at the drive thru at 'Mr. Smiley' burger in case he gets a little bored driving around in his '70 Firebird.Way to go Lester! R.I.P.",Null,0,0,22 January 2003
Legend," Hardy again on top of his game
","I know it's been fashionable to bash this movie, but I thought it was a good watch. Once again, Tom Hardy delivers not one but two awesome acting performances, and kudos to the production crew to make it all look seamless.From what I can ascertain, the film touched on some areas a bit too much (Reggie's relationship with Frances is a key story line), and relegates the boys relationship with their mother to a mere scene or two. Also, Ron's homosexuality is portrayed as quite open, when in fact it wasn't. But that led to a couple of laugh-out-loud lines by Hardy as Ron, and this movie surely needed some humo(u)r.All in all, a decent two-hour viewing experience, and I'm giving it a thumbs up (sorry Roger & Gene).",7,0,1,20 January 2017
Velvet Goldmine," Ground Control to Todd Haynes
","I just finished VELVET GOLDMINE, and I'm not quite sure what I think of it. While visually stunning (including the creative faux rock video and the filming of the 'movie within the movie'), I still was a little disappointed. ***SPOILER*** Since this was a fictional story, couldn't Haynes officially have tied up Brian Slade's whereabouts instead of focusing on Arthur's frolicking with Curt Wild?The use of cool, redone and original artist hits from the period were brought down by the original cuts made for this film. After reading one comment about Haynes' being unable to secure the rights to use Bowie's music, perhaps he should have just scrapped the Bowie angle and just went with an Iggy story. Ewan's portrayal for the Stooges era (and 'full montified'!) James Osterberg was dead on and certainly held my interest the most during the movie.",Null,0,1,12 November 2003
Dog Day Afternoon," classic Al
","Attica! Attica!This was probably the first 'R'-rated movie I was allowed to see (or maybe it was DEATH WISH?). And I really haven't seen too many better ones in the succeeding thirty years. Pacino was still relatively fresh in the eyes of the American public, as we (and when I say 'we', I'm speaking for the U.S. audiences of 1975---I caught up with his earlier work later on through the wonder of VHS) had only witnessed his cooler & less manic acting performances of SERPICO & the two GODFATHERS. But he was allowed to cut loose here, and cut loose he did. It's pretty much a non-stop roller-coaster ride of emotions as the DOG DAY unfolds.John Cazale (who will always remind me of Mike Krzyzewski {'Coach K.} from Duke U.) does a fine job in his own understated, 'psychoish' way. But this is really Al's show, and he doesn't disappoint. So pull up a chair and watch 'The Midget' (as he's referred to in Robert Evans' autobio.) at the top of his game.",9,1,2,18 February 2005
This Is Spinal Tap," I'm just as God Made Me...
","I recently watched it again on DVD with audio commentary from Guest, McKean, and Shearer doing the honors 'in character', and it is honestly the funniest & best commentary track I've heard in this format. The boys know when to ramble, and when to shut up when key lines from the film arise.
Still the best of the three 'Mock-umentarys' (or would it be 'Mock-umentaries'?) Guest has directed and/or starred in.",Null,0,3,29 October 2002
Pulp Fiction," Check out the Big Brain on Brett!!
","Truly a classic.  A movie with long scenes, and they're all well played (believable or not). 
One minute you're laughing, the next scared s---less.  When Jules blasts 'Flock of Seagulls' on the couch while Brett quakes in his boots digesting a 'Big Kahuna' burger, the laughter & fright seem simultaneous.  
Often imitated, & certainly never duplicated, this is (to quote John Cusack's Rob Gordon character in 'High Fidelity') in my 'Top 5 movies of The 90's'.",Null,0,0,18 October 2002
Carrie," Early S. King movie from one of his novels may be the best of all of 'em...
","I saw this in high school (was it really 27 years ago?!), and it sure made a lasting impression.  It's a well made and very gripping horror movie which I always stop to watch for awhile when it's on the telly.Other than the usual teen-movie casting problems I hate where teenagers are all played by actors in their low to mid-20's, it's certainly recommended by me.  It's even got P.J. Soles for comic relief, and nothing says 'late '70's-early '80's classic' like her smiling mug.",Null,0,0,30 April 2003
A Night at the Roxbury," What is Love?
","...PAINFUL!!!***MAJOR SPOILER***Another lame comedy based on a SNL bit. I rented this with my daughter, hoping we'd get at least a couple of laughs. Well, what we got was 81 minutes (it seemed longer) of hell. You'll find out only after only a few minutes why Chazz Palminteri is appearing unbilled in this mess.I laughed exactly once, at the SAY ANYTHING bit, where Doug Butabi (or was it 'Mango'?) held up his boom-box playing our heroes' theme song to woo Steve Butabi ( or was it 'Craig the Cheerleader'?) out of his wedding and back to the nightclubs where he so rightly belongs. There, you now have A NIGHT AT THE ROXBURY in a nutshell, and if I've ruined this movie for anyone, consider yourself lucky. You're welcome.",Null,0,1,22 March 2004
True Romance," Don't condescend me, man. I'll 'F'-in' kill ya, man.
","Once again, Tarantino has delivered a highly entertaining, mostly implausible script. I guess that's why we like him.This movie starts fast, and never really lets up 'til the end. An All-Star cast, and a blurred Elvis as the mentor to Clarence surely help this thing move along nicely. Special points for Brad Pitt...as his 'Floyd' steals the picture. Watching him give driving directions to the mobsters will have you falling out of your chair.Now if you'll excuse me, I'm on my way out the door to catch a Sonny Chiba triple-feature.",Null,1,2,21 November 2002
Goodfellas," 'I thought you said you were alright, Spider'?
","How this movie lost the 1990 Best Picture Award to 'Dances with Wolves' is one of Hollywood's great injustices. To put it another way, if you had three hours to burn right now and had to pick between 'Goodfellas' and 'DWW', which movie would you rather watch?The story is awesome, the acting superb, the laughs and shocks come at you throughout, the body count is high, and the it never drags once in the almost 2 and 1/2 hour running time. Look for at least five future Sopranos stars (you know the actors'names, so I'll give you their HBO alter egos---Dr. Melfi, Christopher, Big Pussy, Paulie Walnuts, & Phil Leotardo) It's an all time TOP 10 treat.",9,0,0,17 April 2003
High Fidelity," 'Walking on Sunshine' never sounded better...
","...Or at least, it didn't sound as grating as it usually does, as Jack Black gyrating to Katrina & The Waves has got to put a smile on your face.This movie works pretty well, and other than the fact that it's a tad bit too long for me, it's another one for the 'plus column' on John Cusack's resume.All of the supporting characters are well acted and well-developed, and Tim Robbins' cameo was downright hilarious.I can recommend it for just about everybody, and music geeks should really enjoy.  Just don't ask for Stevie Wonder the next time you're in your local mom & pop record dive.",Null,0,1,17 July 2003
From Here to Eternity," That's Montgomery Clift, Honey!
","I finally got around to watching this movie after hearing about it for most of my life as a great WWII picture from critics and also from Joe Strummer in the song 'The Right Profile' by The Clash referenced in my summary line. Hell, The Clash (or most-likely, some suit at Sony Music) even named their post-breakup album 'From Here to Eternity: Live'.I'm not going to describe the plot line, which has been discussed numerous times here already. I'll just say I enjoyed it, and everyone should give it a look at some point.Rather, I'm going to throw out a few observations from some guy sitting on a couch nearly 60 years after this thing was filmed.--people were a lot thinner back in the early fifties, and not just the main stars. Look at all the extras in the bar scenes, and you'll agree. I'm sure it had a lot to do with enormous amount of cig. smoking back then, but it sure is noticeable. Ernest Borgnine (perhaps the only main actor from this cast still alive) is known as 'Fatso', and he would have to put on about 100 lbs. to be on 'The Biggest Loser' these days.--Frank Sinatra looks like he weighs less than 150 lbs.! --I had a hard time recognizing Jack Warden, even though he worked steadily in movies for almost 50 years after this film, but Claude Atkins looked exactly like his older self we saw on TV for years.--was Burt Lancaster the first guy to try out the wax-chested/speedo look which became popular in the SoCal muscle beach movies a decade later? --Donna Reed won an Oscar for playing a homogenized Hollywood version of a hooker. Why does the Academy always hand out Oscars to actresses who play prostitutes? Anyway, I didn't buy it. She'll always be Mary Bailey to me, the prototype for June Cleaver and every other beautiful housewife we saw on fifties & sixties TV. Donna even played one herself on her own show after this attempt to play against type.--Finally, Monty Clift was a pretty good actor, but seems to be all but forgotten today. Granted he flamed out early in life, his career wasn't that long and it ended about 50 years ago, but we seem to cherish the other screen icons from his era. I've got some theories as to why this is, but I'd sure like to hear other reasons why he's an afterthought in 2011.",Null,0,0,18 October 2011
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," 'We Thought You Was The Toad'!
","A decent movie, but not the best from Joel & Ethan Coen.  I guess I'd have to rank it behind Fargo, The Big Lebowski, Miller's Crossing, and Blood Simple.  It's about even with Barton Fink and Raising Arizona, and definitely ahead of The Man Who Wasn't There and The Hudsucker Proxy.I guess the big winner in this grand project has to be performers of 'Americana Music', who saw an explosion in popularity for their style during 2001 & 2002.  Despite what had to be enormous odds, Music Producer T-Bone Burnett literally did bring this music 'Down from the Mountain' and into suburban livings rooms.",Null,0,0,25 April 2003
