The Avengers," Some people just love to hate...
","This is the best superhero movie I have ever seen. Full stop. But did you actually read that? Did you get it? This is the best superhero movie I have ever seen.It is about superheroes and it is made with today's technology. Today's technology allows movie makers to design scenes that were technologically impossible before. Any other previous superhero movie I have seen was worse.If you never got into superhero comics then this is not a movie for you.Now back to the summary line. Some (sorry) idiotic reviewers are comparing this movie to: Memento, Blade Runner, Psycho, The Empire Strikes Back, The Matrix, etc. And talking about lack of symbolism, depth, twists, etc. 'This movie doesn't deserve this high rating, etc.' Are you people on drugs?Possible explanations for these 1 star 'punisher' reviews are: 1 some people just love to hate or 2 they had a bad day or 3 they want to show off their 'expert' knowledge of 'le cinema' or 4 they were simply on drugs while watching this movieSo bad news guys: This movie does not have the hyper-realism of 'The Bicycle Thief', the supreme intrigue of 'Citizen Kane', the old fashion romance of 'Casablanca', or the sublime dialogs of '12 Angry Men'. This is only the best superhero movie I have ever seen.I am 50, I have an engineering degree, my favorite pastime is movies, my favorite genre is Sci-Fi, my favorite movie is Blade Runner and THIS IS STILL THE BEST SUPERHERO COMIC BOOK ADAPTATION I HAVE EVER SEEN (sorry for shouting) and this is why in my review this movie deserves a 9 (not 10 because it is not art).If you want to see an 'artsy' movie check out 'The Bicycle Thief' (and take some antidepressants with you). If you want to see what a 'real' superhero would do see 'Chronicle' (highly recommended).If you want to see a good comic book adaptation you cannot do any better than this movie",9,49,91,14 May 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Boring-Check spoiler summary...
",Lets keep it simple the thing is boring like hell. SUMMARY: 1 hour deciding if he is joining in the dwarf quest (although we know he is going ... 4 Pete's sake! The movie has his name) + 2 hours getting attacked all the time without getting a single scratch!This happens when: 1. One bloats a nice simple story into a monster 3x3 truck. 2. One wants to amortize previous special effect investments.Trust me save money time and .... embarrassment (don't say we didn't tell u!).I cannot understand the high scores in these reviews though... paid to review or just 5 year old reviewers?,1,10,18,23 January 2013
