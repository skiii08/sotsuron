Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Waste
","Lucas would appear to have lost it. This is a really poor film, indeed so poor just a week after watching it I can remember only a select few moments. The final sabre battle is well done but that really is the only good aspect of this film.Why an irritating child actor - frequently shouting 'yippee'? Why Jar-Jar Binks - looking like he's lost his way to a computer game? The force can be measured by a blood test?? What happened to the mystery and wonder of the originals? Add to these irritations a very muddled plot, actors that seem rather embarrassed and so much computer animation that it becomes a blur and you have a real dud.I can only hope that this is a low point for Lucas and the Star Wars series - it really can't get any worse than this.",4,0,1,17 May 2002

","Superb. Everything in this film works. The cast, sets, pacing - even the language - it all fits together perfectly. Imaginative, bright and original + funny and hugely entertaining.I've seen a few good films this year (2001) but this is head and shoulders above anything else - you really must make the effort to go and watch it! ONLY watch it in spoken French with subtitles - not dubbed.",9,0,2,17 May 2002
