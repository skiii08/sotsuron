Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Why this film had to be made!
","For years now the politically correct pendulum has swung further and further taking everybody's sense of humour with it. Sanitized by the state and watched over by the thought police until we are unable to laugh at anything anymore for fear of upsetting someone's sensibilities or worse branded a racist. Just when George Orwell's nightmare was becoming a reality along comes Borat to save the day! This film is a middle finger to all the goody, goody self righteous political correct puritans who are too scared to look down in case they notice their own breasts,who can laugh at nothing and find fault in everything. People are funny do funny things and it is OK to laugh. Go on try it! Can anybody remember laughter?",10,6,18,16 November 2006
