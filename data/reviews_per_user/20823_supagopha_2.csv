Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Oh Jar-Jar, How Do I Hate Thee? Let Me Count The Ways.
","I'm sure everyone has heard all their friends, relatives, and random passerbys gripe over the immense waste of computer generated imagery known as Jar-Jar Binks, but I just can't help it.  No movie character has ever driven me to the brink of tongue chomping, teeth gnashing psychosis like that floppy eared moron.  I cannot understand why this creature (which appears to be the combination of a four-year-old, Carribbean native, a mutated guppy, and that weird dragon/dog thing from Neverending Story with bigger lip implants) is even included.  All he manages to do is p*** people off while at the same time manage to avoid death every moment due to some undeserved luck.  So many times I found myself praying that one of the Jedis would just draw their saber and silence the fish-man forever. Unfortunately, the Jedi code restricts such action, proving that the dark side is much more agreeable.Jar-Jar, as horribly evil as he may be, is not the only thing to dislike about this movie.  Who knows why, but Lucas must have decided that people who go to movies only go to movies because they wish to escape a world full of text images, and thus most of the different alien races in Episode 1 speak english, limiting the use of subtitles.  Hey, that's not too bad right?  Well, wait till you hear the Trade Federation honchos that sound like over-exaggerated Japanese-Americans.  Oh, and don't forget the Gungans that remind me of, no offense, a Jamaican with a brain defect.  Since today's illiterate audiences can't muster the mind power to read basic lines to begin with, let's make the characters speak english in horribly offensive accents.  It's just more immense annoyances that make me want to microwave my brain until I drool myself to death.Speaking of annoying, how about that kid who plays Anakin Skywalker, the focus of the three prequels?  Here we have a nine-year-old child who can build things that NASA could only fantasize about, and who tackles such massive sociological issues such as world peace (except multiplied by 100 billion to equal galaxy peace).  In case you were unaware, Anakin is destined to be Darth Vader, so I understand that Lucas wanted Anakin to appear as a good-hearted soul, but boy does he lay it on thick.  Thank you George, I get it, he's sweeter than one of those gigantic lolipops you find at Disneyland, and we should all weep at this boy's impending peril.  I can't tell you how many times I wanted to slap that kid.  It is far too difficult to make a pre-teen appear to be 35.  I just see a spoiled little runt that rocket scientists would envy, yet for some reason we are supposed to care that this adorable little sandy haired genius is doomed to the dark side (which I determined earlier is much more agreeable than all that good Jedi stuff).  Think of all the trouble that would have been saved if Obi-Wan had just smote him on sight.Episode 1 is so ridiculously annoying that I couldn't even pay attention to the highly ornate special effects.  I could care less how seamless Jar-Jar looks.  Why can't he just shut up?  And Anakin, you can stop bragging any time about your wonderful science projects and immeasurable I.Q.  If only you could see into the future.  You might weep as much as I did after suffering through this sci-fi fantasy turned horrendous pile of steaming poo.  Sorry George, maybe next time.",2,172,331,6 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Jaw dropping effects and exceptionally fun moments heavily weighed down by some poor performances.
","After seeing Attack of the Clones today I left the theater chatting with my friends about the insane coolness that is Yoda and other such things, but I also felt a little disappointed.  For a good portion of the film I had gone back to my wide-eyed days of a pre-teen as ships raced through the skies and lightsabers sliced the air.  I felt that tingle of excitement as dozens of jedi drew the sabers, preparing for the ensuing battle.  Unfortunately, I am no longer at the age of ten or eleven.The film, despite how fun it can truly be at times, is brought to a crashing halt frequently during the middle portion of the film.  It's difficult to be a kid and enjoy a love story, but it's even more difficult to not be a kid and find yourself attempting to swallow a poorly delivered love story.  I seriously found the scenes in which Anakin and Amidala fall in love to be painful to watch.  The performances are horrendous.  I have never seen Christensen (Anakin) in anything else, so I have no other roles to compare him to, but he is, to put it frankly, rather bad in Episode 2.
Now I don't think it is actually his fault.  Take a talented actor like Ian McKellan or the late Sir Alec Guiness from the original trilogy and give them Christensen's lines.  George Lucas can create some very interesting stories, but he should leave the finer details to someone with a talent for dialogue.  Portman's character is just as guilty for saying some of the silliest things to come around in a while.Besides the bad dialogue, this love story just plain makes no sense.  It is never truly explained how anyone like Amidala could fall for a weirdo like Anakin who seems to gradually lose his sanity throughout the film.  I would think she would be terrified of a man who is both insistent on her loving him, and a maniac slaughterfest waiting to happen.Now to escape from the negative I will say this: The last 45 minutes is incredible.  It truly shows how far the special effects industry has come. It is amazing, breathtaking.  I'm sure you've heard this from everyone, but Yoda does steal the show.  From being a General in battle to showing off his badass jedi skills, Yoda is by far the greatest thing this film offers.When you go (and you most likely already have) try to make it as best as possible through the inane dialogue.  Laughing at it usually does the trick (just because it's Star Wars doesn't mean you can't make fun of it).  The beginning is alright, the middle a little tedious (the stuff with Obi-Wan and the cloners is actually quite fascinating), but it is in the end that you can finally take your thinking cap off and just scream aloud, 'SWEET!' It really is that incredible.Attack of the Clones is not a terrible film.  Sure, it has subpar performances and awful dialogue, but if you can put it behind you and enjoy the final, jaw-dropping battle, then you will leave not feeling that your time was wasted.  I enjoyed the movie.  It is quite an improvement over Episode 1.  Yes, I was disappointed by the script, but the action is intense and extremely well crafted.  Episode 1 contained too much empty space between its more entertaining scenes, but Episode 2 does keep the action coming in steady doses.  If it didn't, you would surely be put to sleep by the antics of Amidala and Anakin.",1,0,1,18 May 2002
