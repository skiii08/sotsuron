Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A very sick movie!
","That said, I have to admit it was the funniest movie I have seen in a very long time. My gut hurt from laughing so hard! The thing that made Borat work was that Baron Cohen stayed totally in character the entire time. If he had broken character even for a second, it would have made the movie a dismal failure.This is a movie that someone will either love or hate. There is no middle ground. So, why do some folks loathe this movie? Aside from the movie overall being very crude humor, it exposes the true (and oftentimes nasty) underbelly of humankind and many folks prefer to not to believe that people are really like that. The amount of anti-Semitism (and other prejudices) that Baron Cohen seemingly innocently evokes from folks is frightening! Most people would rather bury their heads in the sand and try to convince themselves that they are above that. The truth is quite the opposite! Not many people want to openly admit that they are a bigot! This movie is sick yet it makes a statement about mankind that cannot be ignored. It is also incredibly funny!",8,0,2,25 February 2007
A Star Is Born," The Zombie Story!
","This is now the 4th iteration of this tale.How many more times are they going to keep dredging up this seemingly undead tale? Is there any creativity left in Hollywood? All they seem to make are remakes, sometimes of great movies, though very often of movies that were not too great in their previous iterations, like this movie. (Disney has become the master of the 'beating a dead horse' syndrome!)This movie shows how you can take about 30 minutes of story and drag it out to 135 minutes of tedium! Boring and contrite and very highly overrated!",3,9,17,24 November 2018
Star Trek," If I could give it a zero (or lower) I would!
","I have been a fan but never a fan boy of the Star Trek franchise since 1966. I have praise for some of it. I have loathing for some of it. The series Enterprise was god-awful. The last two movies (before this latest fiasco) were barely watchable.That said, I have to say that this wretched pile of steaming crap by Abrams is the worst ever! Abrams has taken Roddenberry's dream and soiled it with this diarrhetic abomination! It is nothing more than the usual lame 21st century sci-fi flick with lots of glitzy special effects, no story, poor acting and lousy directing. Then, to try and sell this pile of dog droppings, Abrams vomits the Star Trek brand on top of it, trying to pass it off as part of the franchise.Roddenberry is undoubtedly rolling in his grave over this mockery of his dream!",1,4,8,27 August 2010
Kick-Ass," What a piece of crap!
","This movie is confused about what it wants to be. A comedy? There was nothing funny about it. An action movie? Well, there was a lot of action and gratuitous violence. I have also heard some claim this is a parody of Kill Bill. Not bloody likely! Kill Bill (and all Tarantino flicks) was pure genius in the music, the camera angles, the story. Kick Ass had poor acting, pathetic writing and the directing was wooden!Based upon the comments posted here, this movie apparently appeals to prepubescent fan boys that get off watching an 11 year old curse and maim other people.I give this waste of celluloid a very generous 2 only because a rating of 1 should be reserved for complete trash like Battlefield Earth.",1,34,69,26 April 2010
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Maybe the worst movie of the year.
","Put 100 monkeys in a room with 100 typewriters and they would likely come up with a better written script than George Lucas was able to cobble together for this last (thank God!) entry in the Star Wars franchise. To make matters even worse, his directorial skills are perhaps more pathetic than his writing! My personal opinion is that no capable director that took one look at the script would ever be willing to try and direct this bomb.Add to this quagmire of crap some of the worst acting possible. Hayden Christensen needs to use some of the salary he garnered and take some rudimentary acting lessons. Natalie Portman, who has shown herself to be a credible actress in past movies, seems to have left her acting skills home for this one. This isn't to say that all the actors turned in bad performances (though there wasn't much they could do with this script!) Ewan McGregor was quite good and Ian McDiarmid, as always, was superb. And the best performance in this? Frank Oz and the CGI Yoda.Someone really needs to explain to Lucas that computer graphics are supposed to enhance a movie, not be the movie! It seemed as if George tried to cram in as many special effects into each scene and all he succeeded in doing was to give the audience a headache from visual overload.Don't bother buying or renting the DVD. If you really must see it, wait till it comes onto network TV so you don't have to waste any money on this pathetic load of crap!",1,4,9,2 January 2006
