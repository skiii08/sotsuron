The Rock," One of the best action films ever made!
","If you are a fan of any of the actors in this film or a fan of action films, then you really need to do yourself a favor and see this film!  Everything about this film is excellent!  The acting, the story, the directing, the humor, the action...EVERYTHING!  I can honestly say that there is nothing I don't like about the film.Michael Bay, in my book, is without-a-doubt one of the best directors that have come along in quite some time.  I've loved every single one of his films so far and he did not let me down wit this film.  His style of directing is SO COOL to me, everything looks crisp and clear and just PERFECT!The story in this film is absolutely great and there is a reason for every plot point in this film.  The characters in this film are fantastic as well, every single one of them is likeable (not necessarily a likeable person, but as in the character is done well).The acting in this film is excellent and every cast member does a great job with their roles.  Nicolas Cage pulls off one of his best performances and Sean Connery does a great job, as always.  Ed Harris is a highlight in the film too, his character is done VERY well.  There are so many great cast members in this film I'm not going to go through all of them, but they all did a fantastic job!  Although I have to mention Claire Forlani and Vanessa Marcil, these women are just absolutely inrcedible!If I haven't talked-up the movie enough, please go see this movie!  I thought this was one of the best action movies I've ever seen, and I truly hope that you like this film as well.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",10,3,4,22 August 2002
Requiem for a Dream," Not very good.
","I just don't get this sort of movie.  I mean, I understood it fine, there really isn't anything to get, it's just about the lives of these 4 or 5 people and their drug habits and what not.  What I'm trying to say is: 'Why does a movie like this constitute a good movie?'  I just don't get it.  In all honesty, it's not a very interesting story and rather boring.  It's sad to think that a story about people ruining their lives is what is needed to be a good movie.  It also truly saddens me that a movie like this would make it into the top 250 on this site.  This movie would be lucky to make into my top 1000 favorite movies.  I definitely wouldn't recommend going out of your way to see this movie unless you're dying to see it, or have nothing better to do.  Why do the actors in this film get such high praises about their acting?  I didn't see anything terribly great in their performances. Anyway, I'm not really sure how to review this film, I didn't think it was terrible, just boring and uninteresting.  Just because it's filmed in an odd way, doesn't make it an interesting movie.  I hope you like the movie more than I did.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",5,0,1,7 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not as good as the IV V VI, but still good.
","The expectations for this movie were WAY too high!  I must say that I was looking forward to this movie just as much as the next guy (I even went and saw it at 3am opening night), but I wasn't expecting perfection.  I can't disagree that there were a number of problems with this movie, but the film did have it's good aspects as well.I think Jar-Jar was a major problem with this film, and I think most people will agree with me.  I think the idea of the character is ok, but making him a bumbling idiot was a bad move.  Also, what was with his voice?  I'm sure he tested well with the kids, but I would hope that most people over the age of 13 would agree that the movie would have been better if he was portrayed better.  I hear that he's going to have a relatively small part in Episode 2, I kind of hope that he is on screen as little as possible.I wasn't too fond of the comedy in the film.  I don't understand why George Lucas (or whoever made the decision) insisted on putting comedy in a science fiction movie.  At some points it's ok, but in my opinion it is uncalled for.  The one part in particular that makes me so MAD is the scene where Qui-Gon (or was it Obi-Wan?) is talking to the droid in the hangar, and says something to the droid.  The droid then responds with something to the effect of 'Um..let me think...um...does not compute...um...you're under arrest'.  I'm sorry but that is hands-down the STUPIDEST line in the whole friggin' movie!  Let me explain, I'm a computer science major and I do lot of programming (never in artificial intelligence though), but I would imagine that if you were to build a droid, you aren't going to design him to be sarcastic or be a smart-ass would you?  I just thought it was SOOOOOOOO dumb!  Ok...enough about that.Another scene that really angered me was when Boss Nass got all excited and shook his head back and forth real quickly and spit went flying everywhere. What the heck was that?  I was quite displeased with that.I thought the acting was pretty good, and I really don't have much to complain about.  Although, I did think there were a few scenes where Jake Lloyd could have been better, but he did an Ok job, I won't bag on him for it.Ok, enough with the bad, let's talk about the good points in the film.The computer effects alone are worth the movie!  The effects are just incredible!  The pod-race is the best example.  I can't even imagine how long it must have taken them to get that just right, and how much work went into that.  Just amazing!I really enjoyed some of the aliens, Watto, Sebulba and Darth Maul to be precise.  They just had really cool looks about them and cool voices. There were a few aliens that I could have done without, but let's not focus on them.  I also really liked Jabba, at the pod-race.  He actually looked pretty good, a hell of a lot better than the one in the Star Wars: Episode 4 Re-Release.The ships were pretty cool for the most part.  I wasn't too fond of the yellow fighter ships, but I can deal.  You don't always get what you want and you can't please everyone.  I really liked the ships that transformed into robots.  They can only be seen in the beginning of the film, and they're kind of hard to spot, but I assure you, they are there.  I wish they would have been more visible, cause I thought that was a very good idea.The other droids in the movie were pretty cool.  I really liked the destroyer droids (the ones that rolled, and had three legs, I forgot what they are called), but I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.The light-saber fight was INCREDIBLE.  I don't really know why, but when I saw it the first time I wasn't expecting anything from the light-saber fights, but when that scene came, my jaw hit the floor.I've heard a number of people say that they hated the idea of medichlorines (spelling?), but I have to say that I really liked that idea.  I like that they tried to make 'the force' a little more scientific, and not so spiritual.  But, I REALLY didn't like that Anakin didn't have a father. That was LAME!  So, what, was he conceived from the medichlorines?  C'mon, please!All in all, I thought it was a very good movie and I wasn't let down.  Like any other movie, it had it's problems and it wasn't perfect, but it was good.  I'd recommend seeing it, just don't expect the best movie you've ever seen, or you will surely be disappointed.  I think I might also recommend seeing the first trilogy first before seeing this one, cause I actually think it will make more sense that way.  Anyhow, thanks for reading,-Chris",9,0,2,20 February 2002
Catch Me If You Can," Definitely caught my eye.
","When I first saw the trailers for this film I didn't think it looked like anything spectacular.  Although, I am a fan of Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, so I wasn't going to miss this collaboration.  I must say that I was definitely pleasantly surprised, the film was much more than I imagined and really quite fun.The story is just incredible, and what really blows my mind is that it's based on a true story.  There also a great deal more to the story than the obvious, it's not just about a kid that breaks the law and eventually gets caught, there are a number of subplots that make the story infinitely more interesting.  Not only is the story and subplots great, the but the characters, the portrayal of the characters and the chemistry between them are just perfect.Of course the great Steven Spielberg always puts on a great show, but this was particularly good.  I think the best way to put it is that Spielberg really nailed the feel of this film right on the nose, and was very consistent in his style.  I know there's been a few of his films that had certain scenes or lines that I felt were out of place or oddly placed, but this film didn't have anything like that, everything worked perfectly.  Then there's the always great, Tom Hanks!  A truly gifted actor, he ALWAYS puts on a good show and doesn't let you down here.  Leonardo DiCaprio was an excellent choice for the role of Frank Abagnale Jr., and really nailed the role.  He has the ability to look older or younger than he really is when needed, not an ability every actor has.  Other cast members that should be noted are Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, Amy Adams, James Brolin, Nathalie Baye, and Jennifer Garner, all pulling off great performances.This is definitely a Spielberg film not to be missed.  Do yourself a favor and make sure that you see this film.  Even if you are like me and don't think that it looks terribly appealing, give it a shot, you may be surprised.  There is virtually nothing I didn't like about this film, which is a somewhat rare thing for me to say.  I hope you enjoy the film as much as I did.  Thanks for reading,-LebowskiT1000",9,1,2,9 August 2003
Minority Report," One of the best Sci-Fi movies I've seen in a while
","Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise...need I say more?  You just can't go wrong! I have to say the story is absolutely brilliant!  I loved it from start to finish!  There are a few minor things that I was less than fond of, but they were so minor that I didn't let them really bother me.The special effects are just mind-blowing and Spielberg's idea of the future is PERFECT!  A lot of times directors go overboard with their idea of the future, I think Spielberg has the perfect amount of futuristic stuff meshed with present-day stuff.The acting is quite good too from all that appeared in the film.  Tom Cruise pulls off a solid performance as does Colin Farrell and Max von Sydow.  The rest of the cast is great too.If you are a science fiction fan, then I think it's in your best interest to see this film!  I am very happy to see that this film has already made it into the top 250 (and currently the top 150) films on IMDB!  If you're a Tom Cruise or Steven Spielberg fan than you should definitely see this film!  I truly hope that you enjoy the film as much as I did.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",9,0,1,26 June 2002
Training Day," Intense Movie!!!
","I really wanted to see this movie in the theater, but I never got around to it, so I bought the DVD and watched it.  I have to say I am VERY disappointed that I didn't get to see it in the theater.  This is a GREAT movie from start to finish.  Denzel Washington completely deserves his oscar nomination for this one, his portrayal of Alonzo Harris is just incredible! Ethan Hawke deserves a lot of credit for his acting as Jake Hoyt as well, I was truly impressed.The story is very interesting in this film, within the first 20 minutes of the film you're unsure if you should like or dislike Alonzo, but you put up with his unconventional ways for a while, then the movie gets increasingly interesting.  I won't go into depth about the story, 'cause I want you to see it as I did, but let me just say that there were a number of times in the film were I was 'on the edge of my seat'.The only complaint I have about the movie is that Snoop Doggy Dogg, Dr. Dre and Macy Gray were in the film.  Their acting was pretty good though (in their defense), but I just don't like seeing musicians in films (unless they are playing themselves/musicians, i.e. Slipknot in 'Rollerball (2002)' or White Zombie in 'Airheads')I don't want to get your hopes up or anything, but I thought this was an incredible movie, and I hope that you will agree with me.  This movie isn't for everyone, this is DEFINITELY a film for adults, there is a lot of swearing and intense scenes.  I'm not really sure what else to say about this other than 'See this movie!'.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",10,7,18,21 March 2002
The Big Lebowski," Nobody *&@# with the Jesus
","I would have to say this is without a doubt one of my top 10 favorite comedies.  I don't think this movie is for everyone and certainly not for children, but this movie is great.  There are so many scenes that you can act out and have a great laugh with your buddies.  I just saw this movie for the first time less than 3 months ago (sometime in June or July of 2000) and I've seen it 3 or 4 times already.  I haven't seen many of the other Coen brothers movies, but I have seen 'Fargo' (witch I have to say I wasn't all too fond of, I'll have to see it again) and I just saw 'Barton Fink' last night.  I also saw 'Raising Arizona' a while back and loved it.  I'd have to say from what I've seen so far 'The Big Lebowski' is their best work yet.  I have to see 'Blood Simple', 'Miller's Crossing' and 'The Hudsucker Proxy'. And I'm dying to see their upcoming 'O Brother Where Art Thou'.  Anyway, if you are open to interesting comedy, please see 'The Big Lebowski' and pay attention to every word.  Also, make sure you think about everything they say, some of the things they say are hysterical if you think about it, at first it may not seem so funny.  And one last thing, make sure you pay attention to how the characters interact with each other and put yourself in their shoes.  I love this movie!!!  Thanks for reading. -Cortex",10,0,0,27 August 2000
Unbreakable," Worth a look.
","First thing I'm going to say is that if you are interested in seeing this movie, don't go in expecting the same feelings you had when you saw 'The Sixth Sense'.  I thought 'Unbreakable' was a very interesting movie, and I really enjoyed it.  I thought everyone did a fine job in the film, Samuel L. Jackson was good as always, Bruce Willis pulled it off, Robin Wright Penn was fine, and Spencer Treat Clark (Gladiator) was great.  When I went into the theater I didn't have much of a clue of what direction M. Night Shyamalan was going to go with the plot,  and at first I thought the direction he chose was odd, but as the movie went on I began to like it. Again, all I can really say is, don't expect 'The Sixth Sense'.  Hope you enjoy the film.  -Cortex",10,1,1,22 November 2000
Memento," Clever and Interesting, but over-rated!
","'Memento' was definitely an interesting movie, a very clever movie and a very well done movie, but I'm going to have to agree with luigina.ciolfi (one of the previous reviewers on this site) on this film.  It's a good film, but not worthy of a top 10 film of all time.I saw this film a while back and didn't think it was very good, it was WAY TOO confusing, and not terribly interesting.  But a friend of mine wanted to see it, so I went ahead and watched it again with him.  I must say that the film was MUCH better the second time around and made a lot more sense.  But, even still, the movie is nothing profound, if you ask me.  I would have a VERY hard time saying this film is anywhere near my favorite 100 films or even my favorite 500 films.If you're into confusing movies and really like the movie-making aspect of films (editing, directing, acting, etc...) , then you'll probably want to see this film.  But if you're the type of person that just wants to sit back and be entertained, then I'm not sure what to tell you.  This is not an action-packed film, there is virtually no action and is a very slow film, but not to the point where you're looking at your watch every five minutes.So, if you do end up seeing the movie, make sure you pay attention to every word and every scene as closely as possible.  I hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading.-Chris",7,1,2,13 August 2002
The 13th Warrior," A great film!
","I thought 'The 13th Warrior' was a fabulous film!  The characters were all very interesting, and well done.  There were a number of scenes that I thought were just brilliantly directed.  For instance, when the Antonio Banderas character is learning the Northmen Language.The story is nothing terribly complicated, it can basically be summed up to: A guy is banished from his home and then ends up with a bunch of Northmen. He is then chosen by an oracle-like person to go on a quest with 12 other warriors to help some friends of the Northmen, who have requested help from the Northmen.  So, of course they all go to help them out.The only problem I have with the story is why the Antonio Banderas character actually decides to help them.  There is virtually nothing in it for him, but he goes with them anyway.  It would be nice to have some explanation, but I can deal without it.I thought this was a very entertaining movie and I thought it was an interesting story.  I would recommend watching this film if you haven't seen it already (if this sound like a film you'd be interested in seeing).  I hope you enjoy the film as much as I do.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",10,0,1,30 July 2002
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Good and Bad
","If you have seen the tv show, then you are going to get exactly what you expected and maybe more.  But, if you haven't seen the show and think it looks kind of funny...see the show first.  If you don't like the show you are going to HATE this movie.  I personally thought it was pretty cool.  I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, but it was nonetheless good.",7,1,2,12 July 1999
The Fifth Element," I'm sorry, but this is a horrible movie.
","I find it hilarious that most of the people that have left comments on this movie either HATE the film or LOVE the film.  There's only a few people that say 'It's alright'.I saw this movie when it first came out in the theaters and hadn't bothered seeing it again till last night, and I'd have to say that I liked it even less this time around.To be perfectly honest, I thought it was a HORRIBLE movie!  I don't really get why anyone would like it.  The story is horrible, the music terribly mis-placed, the comedy is just dumb and the characters are lame.Ok, so the 'Fifth Element' is this alleged 'perfect being' (Milla Jovovich)? I'm sorry...but STUPID!!!  And while I'm on the subject, why does everyone like Milla so much?  Don't get me wrong, she's a fine actress and an ok looker, but for this 'perfect being' couldn't they get someone more-perfect than Milla, I guess I just wasn't terribly impressed with her looks.  Ok, back to what I was saying about the plot...there is this big ball of 'evil' coming towards the earth?  Again...STUPID!!!  They didn't even attempt to explain what the HELL this big ball of evil is or where it came from or why it was headed toward earth.  Maybe I just missed something in the film, but it didn't make any sense to me.Ok, I have to mention this now, How on earth can anyone say that Chris Tucker's character was interesting...no wait...tolerable?  Chris' character was GOD-AWFUL!!!  Screaming like a little whiny bitch every 5 seconds!  His character was utterly useless, his character could have EASILY been cut out of the film and it would have made a MUCH better film.The only other character that I hated just as much as Chris Tucker's was the president of the federation.  The casting person should be shot!  Why did they choose Tommy 'Tiny' Lister as the president?  He looks like a cross-eyed retarded thug!  I just couldn't accept that this guy was the president, ANYONE else would have fit-the-mold better than this guy.As for Gary Oldman, I thought he did a fine job with the character he played, but what was with all that lame-ass wardrobe?  What was with that stupid plastic thing on the one side of his head.  I just couldn't buy it, I thought it was dumb looking.  And while I'm thinking of it, what the HELL was up with that stupid looking animal thing that Gary Oldman had in his office when he almost choked near the beginning of the film?  It looked like something you'd see in a Flintstones movie (no disrespect to the Flintstones).  I just thought it was SO out of place and SO un-needed.Also, I couldn't stand those aliens that had the egg shaped ship in the beginning of the film.  I couldn't stand their little heads, their enormous shoulders, and how slow they moved.  I didn't get it, were they aliens or robots or aliens in robotic suits or what?I didn't really have any problem with the Ian Holm character or Bruce Willis', but those were the only two that I could easily tolerate.I WILL give some kudos to the special effects department, IMPRESSIVE!!!  In fact, I'm actually considering buying this movie just for the special effects, they're really quite good.  But sadly, that's the only thing it's got going for it.You know, I like just about every sci-fi movie that comes along and I'm not kidding, I like just about everything, but I really DIDN'T like this film. It had a few good ideas, but it just seemed like they gave a 5 year-old a whole lot of money to make a movie.  Overall, I'm not going to stop you from seeing this movie, come to your own conclusion, but it was just dumb.  I hope you enjoy the film more than I did.  Until next time,-Cortex",5,12,26,21 April 2001
Batman Returns," A Superb Sequel!!!
","'Batman Returns' is an excellent sequel to an excellent film.  I cannot express enough how happy I am that Tim Burton returned as director and Michael Keaton returned to the title role.  Tim Burton is an excellent director!  He has the occasional eye-rolling moment, but overall, he is very good at what he does.  Michael Keaton is absolutely fantastic as Bruce Wayne/Batman!  The Batman suit looks excellent in this film, they really did a fantastic job with the outfit!The rest of the cast is very good as well.  Danny DeVito plays a very good Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer is perfect as Catwoman (and isn't that bad on the eyes either).  Christopher Walken does a very good job as Max Schreck as well.  Michael Gough, Michael Murphy, Pat Hingle, and Andrew Bryniarski were very good supporting cast members as well.I don't think I can say that this film was better than the original 'Batman', but it was very good in it's own right.  The story was pretty good, but there are a few problems here and there that I had with it. Overall, I thought this was a good second installment to the Batman series, but could have been a little better.  I would definitely recommend first seeing the original 'Batman', and then give 'Batman Returns' a look.  I hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading,-Chris",7,0,1,8 November 2002
Blade," One of the better comic book adaptations
","Blade was a very FUN movie.  Lots of action and a pretty interesting story. I'm usually not one for vampire movies, but this movie did a pretty good job of keeping me interested.  There are only a few things in the movie that really drove me up the wall.  SPOILERS AHEADI couldn't stand the 'Pearl' character.  What the heck was that?  That was a useless character to put in the movie and EXTREMELY out of place.  Why does everyone look human-like except for this disgusting thing?  Dumb Dumb Dumb!!!I also hated the way the vampires exploded at the end of the film.  The computer animation looked HORRIBLE and like a cartoon!  I don't know why the director insisted on having the vampires blow up like a balloon and then explode all over the place.One other thing that kind of bothered me, but wasn't anything terribly infuriating was right at the end of the movie when Blade throws the vile in the air and spins around and kicks the vile-dart-thing into Frost.  Sure it kind of looks cool, but c'mon, NO ONE could do that!Other than those three things in the film, I thought it was great, and truly enjoyed the film.  If you're looking for some cool fighting, some cool action, a bunch of vampires and a pretty interesting story, then this is the movie for you.  I hope you enjoy the film as much as I did.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",8,0,1,25 March 2002
The Others," Much better than expected.
","I don't know why, but I had rather low expectations of this film.  I was definitely pleasantly surprised.  I still wouldn't say this was a terribly great movie.  It was good, but nothing great.  I'm actually VERY shocked that this film made it into IMDB's top 250.Also, I must admit that the film was MUCH better on the second viewing, perhaps it gets even better on the third time around.  I'll have to test that theory one of these days.The acting is pretty good for all the cast members, Nicole Kidman being the only cast-member that I've previously heard of.  Although, I did recognize Christopher Eccleston (Charles Stewart) from 'Gone in Sixty Seconds', but I certainly didn't know him by name when I first saw the film.The story is quite interesting and takes a very interesting route of telling the story.  There is a number of similarities between this film and 'The Sixth Sense', but I think I must concede that this film is pretty good in it's own right.  The only complaint about the story in the film is, I didn't like that the children had this weird photosensitive disease.  Does this condition ACTUALLY exist?  I can't imagine it does.  But you know the saying, sometimes Fact is stranger than Fiction.  The children having this condition does work quite well with the story, so maybe I should just accept it.If you're into creepy/strange/odd/ghostly movies like 'The Sixth Sense', then you'll probably like this film too.  I would have a tough time saying this film is for everyone, but like I said, if you're into creepy movies, then you may want to take a peak.  Anyhow, hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading.-Chris",8,0,0,11 June 2002
Chicken Run," Chicken Impossible
","Wow!!!  What a great movie, I really enjoyed 'Chicken Run'.  I've seen a few of the Wallace and Gromit shot films, but this was even better.  The comedy was great, I'm sure that people of all ages can appreciate this movie.  I won't go as far as to say that this is one of the funniest movies, I've ever seen, but I definitely found myself cracking up at certain points.  There is a lot of comedy that you just have to think about and it becomes even funnier.  Anyway, if you are at all interested by the previews, you'll most likely like this, but if the previews don't entertain you, I doubt the movie will.  Enjoy,-Cortex",10,0,0,27 June 2000
Insomnia," Good Movie.
","To be brutally honest, I wasn't really too stoked about seeing this movie. What I mean to say is that it looked good, but it didn't really strike me as anything great from the previews.  Also, I must say that I was less than stoked about Christopher Nolan directing (I wasn't a fan of 'Memento', it was ok, but nothing great).  Well, needless to say, I ended up going to see this movie anyway.  I must concede that I liked the movie a great deal more than I thought I would.  Even about half way through the film I wasn't sure if I was really liking where the film was going, but by the end I was happy with the film.Again, I have to be brutally honest, I'm not a huge fan of Al Pacino. I've liked a bunch of his movies, but I don't think he's anything terribly great. But, I thought he did a great job in this film.  I've always been a huge fan of Robin Williams, this was quite a different role for him, but he pulled it off.  It was a little odd to see him as the antagonist, but he did a great job.  Hillary Swank (another person that I think is a pretty good actor/actress, but nothing great) did a great job too, and looked really good.  The rest of the cast did a fine job too, Maura Tierney, Nicky Katt, Jonathan Jackson, etc...The story was quite interesting, and did a great job of keeping you interested.  I thought the story did a great job of keeping you guessing whether or not Robin Williams' character was telling the truth of lying. I can't really say any more than that, or else I'll give away the good parts of the film.I thought this was a really good film, and definitely worth watching.  I wouldn't say it was anywhere near the best movie I've ever seen, but it was quite good.  I hope that you like the film as much as I do.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",9,0,0,15 June 2002
X-Men," One of my all time favorites!
","With X-Men 3 about to be released in less than a month, I had to bust out my X-Men DVD and give it another watch. What a great movie! Even now I'm blown away with how well the movie was made, it's truly fantastic and there's almost nothing I would change in the film. From the opening scene at the concentration camp you know this is going to be a well done movie! The characters are absolutely fantastic and handled so perfectly. The relationships and chemistry are all very well written and truly felt by the audience. There are so many scenes that make me grin like an idiot because it's so well done. Particularly the first scene with Professor Xavier and Erik Lensherr (Magneto) discussing philosophies. Then there's the scenes with Marie (Rogue) and Logan (Wolverine), Logan (Wolverine), Scott (Cyclops) and just about all the others for that matter.The story is nothing short of brilliant. Basically, humans are being born that are different than the 'normal' human and the normal humans are naturally fearful of these mutants. So...there are two camps of mutants, those who want to work to live in peace with humans (The X-men) and those that feel they are superior to humans and will eventually dominate the earth (The Brotherhood of Mutants). And thus the premise is set and story flows from there.Of course, you have to mention the special effects in a film of this nature. I can safely say that the special effects are perfect in this film, there isn't a single scene that is badly done, most of the special effects are rather subtle and rarely in your face and never over-done. This is truly what a sci-fi movie should be; special-effects that serve a story, not the other way around.If you haven't seen this film by now, I really don't know what you're waiting for. This is truly one of my favorite films of all time and definitely deserves a view (or two, or three). I strongly urge you to give this film a chance.Can't wait for X-Men: The Last Stand, I hope it's good.",10,0,0,15 July 2000
The Terminator," Sci-fi/Action done right!
","James Cameron deserves a lot of credit or hatching this incredible story and brilliant idea!  This is one of the best told sci-fi/action stories out there.  The action never stops, the story makes complete sense, the acting is great, the special effects are top-notch (given the year that it was made) and the make-up effects / creature designs are phenomenal.All of the actors involved pull off fantastic performances.  Particularly Arnold Schwarzenegger (although he has VERY few lines in the film), Michael Biehn, Linda Hamilton, Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen.  Also, keep a watchful eye for Bill Paxton in the beginning of the film, as one of the punks that has a rendezvous with The Terminator.The special effects and make-up effects are outstanding, given that the film was made back in 1984.  By todays standards some of the effects aren't very impressive and at a few times they're actually rather silly looking, but nonetheless well done.  But there are a few times that are just as good as today's special effects and are simply jaw-dropping.The only complaint I have about the film is the music at a few points in the film.  It's not really that bad, it just brands the film as an OBVIOUS 80's film.As I mentioned, the story is just spectacular and told perfectly well.  The story fluidly unfolds from scene to scene and definitely keeps your attention.  If you are one of the few people out there that hasn't seen this film and likes science fiction movies, you should DEFINITELY check this film out, there's something for everyone in this film.  Although, be warned that this NOT a film for children, it definitely has an R rating for a reason. Do yourself a favor and go see this film, I hope you enjoy it.

We Were Soldiers," Pretty good, but nothing terribly spectacular.
","I don't think I went into the theater with too high of expectations, but I didn't think the movie was anything great.  Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie, but it's a Vietnam movie, nothing we haven't seen before.  Mel Gibson pulls off a good performance as well as the other cast members.  This is a bloody movie though, so this movie isn't for everyone.  In the first 5 minutes you see a lot of blood, shooting and what not, but I guess that is to be expected with a war movie.  Anyhow, there isn't a whole lot that I can say about this movie.  There really wasn't anything in the film that I didn't like, but there also wasn't any thing that really stuck out as great. It's a good movie and if you like war movies, then you'll probably like this one.  But if you are just a so-so war-movie fan (like myself) then you'll probably think it was just 'OK'.  Anyhow, I hope you enjoy the movie, and thank for reading.-Chris",8,1,2,20 March 2002
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Just as good as Empire Strikes Back
","'Return of the Jedi' is a great continuation of the Star Wars saga.  Like 'Empire Strikes Back' I really liked the new worlds or revisited worlds that were shown to us; Tatooine, Degobah, Endor.The entire scene in Tatooine (Jabba's Palace) is just great!  There is so much cool stuff to look at; all the cool aliens, the RANCOR, Jabba himself, Leia in that metal bikini, and so on.Apparently a lot of people had a problem with the Ewoks, but I personally thought they were great!  I loved the whole forest scene with the speeder bikes and the AT-ST's.  Who doesn't love those Biker Scout outfits?  VERY COOL!I could go on for days about this movie, but I won't.  Just do yourself a favor and go see 'A New Hope', 'Empire Strikes Back' and then 'Return of the Jedi'.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",10,0,0,21 February 2002
Scary Movie 2," Not nearly as good as the original, but it has it's moments.
","I think it would have been a better idea to not make this movie, but hey, they did it anyway.  I wouldn't dare say this was anywhere near as good as 'Scary Movie', but there are a few good scenes and ideas in this film.  Some of the jokes though were just NOT FUNNY!!!  Also, I lot of the jokes were just recycled from the first film.With all that said, I wouldn't say the movie was a total waste of time, there was some really good comedy in the film and even found myself laughing pretty hard at times.  Also, if you're looking for a reason to watch this film, watch it for Anna Faris, Tori Spelling and especially Kathleen Robertson!  GOOD GOD!!!All I can say is if you liked the first film and are at all interested in this film, go for it, check it out.  Besides, it's only 83 minutes long, that's gotta be one of the shortest movies I've ever seen.  I hope you enjoy the film.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",8,1,3,16 August 2002
Blade II," Pretty good sequel
","I was pretty pleased with 'Blade II' for the most part.  There was a lot of things that I didn't like, but not enough to ruin the movie for me.  Some of the fight scenes were down-right incredible, but a few times the director went a little overboard with the computer effects.  Some of the scenes looked a little silly due to the computer effects.  This is going to sound a little odd, but I thought some of the fight scenes were a little too much of a comic book (flying all over the place, people getting thrown across the room, impossible martial arts moves, etc).  Being a movie made from a comic book, that might sound odd, but they were just too over-the-top.  But, like I said for the most part, it was a pretty decent movie.  I liked all the characters, and in some cases I was sad to see them die so soon because I thought there was potential for a kick-ass fight with him/her, but that didn't pan out.Compared to the first Blade, I thought it was probably just as good.  I liked the story in Blade II a lot actually, it was pretty interesting, and I loved that Blade and the Vampires were forced to team-up to take on these new breed of vampires called 'Reapers'.  Very ironic!  Anyhow, the action is great, the story is great, the characters are great.  If you've seen the original Blade and liked it, then you'll probably like this one as well.  Be forewarned though, this movie is a lot more bloody than the first film.As far as a third installment goes, I'm all for it.  I'd love to see Blade again in another adventure.  Anyhow, I enjoyed the movie, and I hope you will too.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",8,0,1,25 March 2002
Empire of the Sun," Good Movie, worth a peak.
","Before seeing this movie, I had virtually no idea what the movie was about, the only thing I knew was that it took place during world war 2, the 1940's.The story was pretty interesting and did a good job of keeping my interest. I liked all the acting, and I liked the bulk of the characters.  I couldn't figure out why this kid, Jim (Christian Bale), kept going back and hanging out with Basie (John Malkovich) when he just screwed him over left and right.There really isn't a whole lot I can say about this film other than it was an alright film, but it wasn't anything terribly moving or earth-shattering. Also, the film is a little too long for me.  It was good, but long.  So, if you're thinking about watching it, make sure you've got 2.5 hours to spare.All in all, it was worth my time, and pretty interesting.  It's always cool to see the early work of famous actors/directors.  I liked seeing Joe Pantoliano, Christian Bale and Ben Stiller in their earlier works and of course it was great to see another one of the films that made Steven Spielberg the man he is today.I hope you enjoy the movie.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",8,0,2,21 March 2002
Rocky II," Excellent sequel
","'Rocky II' is one of those sequels that is just as good as the original, if not better in some aspects.  I can't say it's better than the original because you can't have the second film without the first one.  Meaning that this film does not stand on it's own, you need the first film to understand the characters and back-stories of everything in this film. But all in all, I think 'Rocky II' is slightly more enjoyable than the original 'Rocky'.In all honesty, I think this film is better directed than the first film. The story seems to flow quite nicely and is slightly faster paced than the original.  Not only that, but the main fight in the film is much more exciting and longer.The acting in 'Rocky II' is better as well, or at least I thought so. Sylvester Stallone does a fantastic job with his role of Rocky Balboa and really struts his stuff here.  Talia Shire and Burt Young also pull off nice performances.  Carl Weathers plays the character of Apollo Creed to a 'T'.  And of course, Burgess Meredith does a fantastic job as Mickey.This is one of those sequels that truly has the same feel as the original. Granted, it isn't as fresh as the original...but it's a re-match that can't be missed.  If you liked the original 'Rocky', then you definitely ought to check this one out, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  I hope you like the film as much as I do.  Thanks for reading,-LebowskiT1000",9,95,101,8 October 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Another Great Installment!!!
","I have to say that I was very pleased with this installment.  Contrary to a great many people, I loved Episode 1, and I thought this one was just as good.  I don't think I could dare say that it was better than Episode 1, but maybe after a few more viewings my opinion will change.  We'll see. Anyhow, the special effects are just mind-blowing in this film, just as they were in EP1!!!  There are some scenes that really made my jaw hit the floor.  And a few choice scenes that just made me very happy.  Also, I loved the various kinds of beasts that they had in the movie.  VERY COOL!!! As far as acting goes, I thought it was all pretty good.  I'm not really one to go around knocking actors for their acting job, and I'm not going to in this case.  Although, I must admit that I was a bit skeptical of Hayden Christiansen playing Anakin, but he pulled it off, and I think he did a good job.  The rest of the cast is quite good. The one major complaint about the film that I have is the comedy in the film.  Sometimes...and I do mean SOMETIMES, the comedy is pretty funny, but a number of times it just comes off corny or cheesy.  I really think that Lucas should just steer clear of the comedy aspect and make it more serious. As far as story goes, I thought the story was pretty good, but there were/are a lot of questions that I have about the movie.  Hopefully a few repeat viewings will answer all my questions.  But if not, then there are some serious story problems. I was kind of glad to see that Jar Jar had a very minimal part in the film. I agree with most people in that he was a serious detriment to EP1, but I think some simple tweaking would have alleviated the problem.  If they'd just made him not-so-much an imbecile and changed his voice to not be so childish, everyone would be much happier.  Anyhow, that's more of a review for EP1. All in all, I thought EP2 was a great movie and a great addition to the Star Wars Saga.  I truly hope that you enjoy the film as much as I did.  I can't wait for EP3!!!",10,0,2,16 May 2002
Predator," One of Schwarzenegger's best!!!
","I can honestly say that the idea behind 'Predator' is one of the coolest Sci-Fi stories I've ever heard/seen.  I absolutely love the idea of an alien being coming to earth, not to meet new life-forms, but to find a good hunt! Brilliant!!!  I like the idea of the hunter becoming the hunted!The cast is superb in this film.  Arnold Schwarzenegger plays the perfect Dutch, Carl Weathers plays the perfect Dillion, Jesse Ventura as Blaine, Bill Duke as Mac, and so on an so forth.  Everyone is great in this film!!!The look of 'The Predator' is just perfect too!  I can't say enough about how much I like the look of 'The Predator'.  Stan Winston did a fantastic job with the design.  Kevin Peter Hall did a fantastic job playing 'The Predator' as well!Not only does this film have a great cast and a great creature designer, but it has one of the best directors around, John McTiernan (Hunt for Red October, Die Hard, Die Hard: With a Vengeance, 13th Warrior, Medicine Man, and more).  John really did a great job directing.Well, if you haven't seen this film yet, I really think you're missing out on something great.  I would definitely recommend seeing this film and I really, truly hope you enjoy it as much as I do.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",10,2,2,7 June 2002
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Excellent blend of comedy and drama!
","Robin Williams' role in this film is probably his best known to date, as it should be.  This is a great film!  I suppose this falls in the category of comedy, but there is also a great deal of drama in the film as well.  The film has some interesting things to say about war, politics, racism, friendship, the military and a few other things (or at least that's what I got out of it).  Of course, the comedy greatly outweighs the drama in the film and is absolutely great all the way through the film.  If you are a fan of Robin Williams' comedy, be sure to check this film out.  The cast in this film is very good.  Robin Williams is, of course, just fantastic in the film.  He's a little nutty sometimes, but that is to be expected and that's what the role called for.  Forest Whitaker is very good in his role and plays a very likeable character.  Bruno Kirby, on the other hand, plays a very UN-likeable character, but did a fantastic job with the role.  The rest of the supporting cast was very good as well: JT Walsh, Robert Wuhl, Noble Willingham, etc...  Director, Barry Levinson, did a very good job with this film as usual.  If you are a fan of Robin Williams or any of the cast/crew, then you should definitely check out this film.  If you like war-comedy films, then you should take a look at this film.  I feel that the film is most definitely worth seeing, so do yourself a favor and go see it.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",8,1,1,26 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Good Movie
","I seriously doubt there's anything I can say about this film that hasn't already been said, but I'm going to put in my 2 cents anyway.  I thought the film was very good.  The movie is a little to 'fantastic' or perhaps 'magical' would be a better word, for me, but nonetheless I liked the movie. As crazy as it may sound, I actually saw this movie twice in the same day. I saw it at 12:00am opening morning and at about 7pm that same day.  Anyhow, I thought the movie was great, but it was really hard to sit through the second time.  I kept wanting it to hurry along and get to the cool parts.I will say that is was directed incredibly well.  I was a little skeptical about Peter Jackson directing the movie.  I loved 'The Frighteners', but HATED 'Dead Alive', both directed by Peter Jackson, but he pulled it off.One complaint I have about the film is that if they are going to have such a 'fantastic'/'magical' movie, then there was a sever lack of Gandalf using magic.  I have never read the book, so I have no idea how closely it follows the book (I hear from friends and reviews that it follows it pretty well), but I really wanted to see Gandalf do some cool magic.I have no idea why, but to be perfectly honest, I'm not all that excited about the sequel 'The Two Towers', although that doesn't mean I'm not going to see it.  I'm sure that I'll see it, but I'm just not all that excited about it.  Maybe I'll be eating my words when I see some more trailers/previews.  Time will tell, we'll see.All in all, I thought it was a good movie and worth a look.  Be aware that it is a long movie though, so get comfortable.  I hope you enjoy the film. Thanks for reading,-Chris",9,0,0,13 May 2002
Cast Away," Definitely worth a couple viewings.
","I'll be honest, the first time I saw this film, I wasn't too sure if I liked it.  I mean, I certainly enjoyed it, but I just wasn't too sure of how I felt about the film as a whole.  I must say that this film was MUCH better the second time around.  And just got better with each additional viewing. I am a huge Robert Zemeckis fan, so maybe my expectations were slightly skewed at first.  But, all in all, I've watched the film enough times now that I can say 'I love this film!!!'When I really stop and think about it, the film is brilliantly executed. The scenery is absolutely breath taking, the special effects are so well done that you don't even realize that there are special effects present. This seems to be a trademark of Robert Zemeckis (case and point, 'Forrest Gump').  The acting is very good, although, there's only 2 real sources of acting in this film, Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt.  The rest of the cast was good, but their roles were very minor.  Tom Hanks pulls off another great performance, as usual.  You really can feel all of his emotions while he's stuck on the island.  Also, not many actors have changed their physical appearance like Tom Hanks did for this film, I truly applaud him for his work.  As much as I liked Russell Crow in 'Gladiator', I firmly believe that Tom Hanks deserved it more (although that would be his third Oscar).  Helen Hunt also pulls off a very nice performance.  There is also a good deal of comedy in the film, and it is done very well.This is one of the few films that I strongly recommend you watch.  There aren't a great many films that I would say this, but this one I would. Although...if you aren't a fan of Tom Hanks, then you might have some trouble with this film because a great deal of the film is him alone on an island.  So, if that is the case, then you are off the hook.  So, I hope you watch the film, and I hope that you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",10,102,136,14 October 2002
Lilo & Stitch," Interesting Film
","I'm not really sure if I like this film or not.  There are definitely a lot of things that I do like about the film, but I'm just not sure if I really like the film as a whole or not.  This is definitely a kids movie, there's no question about that, but it seems odd to me that this film has a great deal of silly childish humor and at the same time has some more adult concepts and themes.The characters are all pretty cool, but I thought the origin of Stitch was really odd, and definitely not what I was expecting.  I thought he was just going to be an alien that somehow got stranded on earth, but it's not all that simple.  You'll just have to see the movie to know what I am talking about.Stitch and Captain Gantu were definitely the coolest looking aliens in the film and beautifully drawn.  The rest of the characters were fine, but just didn't strike me anything special.I guess I liked the movie, but I didn't think it was worth paying a full price ticket for.  If you are a Disney fan, then you should definitely see the film.  Otherwise, I'd probably suggest seeing the movie at matinee price.  I hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading.-Chris",7,2,2,30 July 2002
Armageddon," All in good fun, but not excellent.
","Ever since this film and 'Deep Impact' came out, I've been unsure as to which I liked better.  I've always been leaning towards Deep Impact, so the other day I watched 'Deep Impact' and today I watched 'Armageddon'.  I have to say that on the whole, I liked Deep Impact much more.  But that doesn't mean that Armageddon isn't a good movie, in it's own right, Armageddon has some good things going for it.Armageddon is much 'flash-ier' than Deep Impact and definitely more action-oriented.  You can tell that director Michael Bay went for the 'what looks coolest' approach, which is fine with me, but sometimes he went a little too far.  Michael Bay also seems to like going for the 'absolute worst case scenario' / 'get there just in time' sort of situations.  As I said, Armageddon has some good things going for it.  The story is pretty good, the acting is quite good, there is a great deal of humor, a lot of great lines, and some superb special effects.  Also, this films plays the 'romance chip' much more than Deep Impact does, so if it's romance you want, then this is the film for you.There are a bunch of superb actors in this film, including Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Will Patton, Steve Buscemi, William Fichtner, Owen Wilson, Michael Clarke Duncan, Peter Stormare, Jason Isaacs, Ken Hudson Campbell, and Keith David.  All of the cast did a fantastic job and I really liked their characters!  I thought they were all very unique and quite interesting to watch.  Their interactions were great to watch as well.All in all, I thought this was just a fun, action-packed, humorous, sci-fi story, with a touch of romance.  I wouldn't recommend this to everyone, but it should appeal to a wide variety of people.  Also, don't start watching this film expecting a completely realistic film, because this isn't.  It's just a fun story, with a lot of cool things to look at.  I would say that if you're torn between watching 'Armageddon' or 'Deep Impact' and don't plan on watching both films, then go with Deep Impact, but as I can see from the reviews on this site, it seems that everyone disagrees.  Some like Deep Impact more, some like Armageddon more, some (like me) like them both, and some hate them both.  So, I'm not really sure what to tell you.  Well, if you end up seeing this film, I hope you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",10,1,2,14 October 2002
Pitch Black," Pretty Good Sci-Fi Film
","This is a pretty good sci-fi film, it is far from great, but it's pretty good in it's own right.SPOILER ALERT!Maybe it's just me, but I found it really hard to give any kind of care what happened to Riddick (Vin Diesel).  I guess the movie is all about the changes his character goes though, but I didn't really get what suddenly made him change his mind and decide to go back and rescue the little girl and the religious guy.  So Carolyn admitted that she was willing to die for them...Ok...so why does Riddick think that's a good enough reason to help her?Also, I HATED that Carolyn (Radha Mitchell) got killed at the end of the film.  I never really understand why a writer works so hard to make sure a character lives till the end of film, just to get killed off.  Of course sometimes this is very appropriate, but I didn't find this to be one of those times.  Why was it so important to kill off that character?  So that Riddick could see that she was willing to die for him...and DID!?  I guess that makes sense, but that still kind of sucks.As for the creatures themselves...EXCELLENT!  I loved the design of the animals, I loved the idea that they can only come out when there is no light, I loved that light actually hurt them, I loved the way their vision looked, I loved everything about them!  Some of the CG work was a little cartoony, but I'm not going to let that ruin anything for me.All in all, I thought it was good movie, but nothing absolutely spectacular. Although, I did think the story was VERY cool, and pretty well told.  If you're a die-hard sci-fi fan like myself, then you're probably going to want to see this, but if you're not so much into sci-fi, then don't go out of your way to see it, but it may still be worth your time.  Anyhow, I hope you like the film and thanks for reading,-Chris",9,0,0,26 May 2002
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," An excellent installment, worth the 12-year wait.
","When I first heard that James Cameron wasn't going to be involved with the third installment to this fantastic series, I was less than pleased.  The thought of another director taking over the franchise kind of upset me, I just had to hope that they would find a director that could fill those rather large shoes.  I later heard that Jonathan Mostow was named director of T3 and was pleased due to being VERY impressed with both of his previous directorial efforts, 'Breakdown' and 'U-571', but of course I was still skeptical.So the film was finally released and of course I went and saw it opening weekend.  Let me tell you I was NOT let down!  I thought the film was truly fantastic!  I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with me and I'm sure plenty might even get upset with me, but I thought 'Terminator 3' was just as good as both previous installments of the series.  They all had their pros and they all had their cons.I was at first a little uneasy with the idea of a female terminator.  But, after seeing the film and thinking about I've come to the conclusion that having a female terminator if a brilliant idea.  What would have an easier time infiltrating just about anything?  A gorgeous and sexy woman or a large intimidating man?  The woman, definitely!  Besides, Jonathan Mostow did such a fantastic job with the T-X that it just worked perfectly.The special effects in the film are truly amazing, looking even better than the effects in T2.  There were VERY few times where I thought it looked like obvious CG.  There is one scene in the first few minutes of the film that show a slew of Terminators walking around doing what they do that nearly brought tears to my eyes, it looked so awesome!  I won't get into the specifics, but the special effects are reason enough to see this film.The actors all did a fantastic job.  I thought Nick Stahl was an excellent replacement for Edward Furlong.  When I first heard Nick was taking over the role I didn't think he looked the part, but he really pulled it off.  In fact, in the end, I'm happier that Nick took over the role rather than Edward Furlong continuing his role, because I really don't think Edward looks the part anymore, he was fine as the young John Connor, but I don't think he'd work well as the John Connor of this film.  Claire Danes did a fantastic job as well, she pulled off a great job in the film and looks as beautiful as ever.  Kristanna Loken plays the part of the T-X very well, looking sexy as can be and doing a great job with her facial expressions and her limited dialogue.  I'll definitely be keeping an eye out for her future work.  Then of course, there's the great Arnold Schwarzenegger, reprising his role as The Terminator (T-800/T-101).  Arnold, again was excellent as the Terminator and didn't let me down.  There is also a very nice cameo by Earl Boen, the only other actor to reprise a role from the first two installments in the Terminator series.  Despite having very little screen time, he did a great job and I was very happy to see him in the film.Personally I thought the story in this film was great and very well thought out.  There are a few things that may have been overlooked or improperly explained, but nonetheless, this is a movie we're talking about here and there are bound to be a few plot holes, so I didn't let those little things affect my enjoyment of the film.The only thing I would complain about if I had to, is some of the humor in the film.  I won't deny that the jokes were funny, but I thought some were a little misplaced, this is, after all an R-rated sci-fi/action film.  There were only really two or three comedic moments that I thought should have been excised from the film, but otherwise I thought everything worked pretty well.I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that liked the previous Terminator films.  I would hope that you can enjoy this for what it is and not what James Cameron MIGHT have done had he directed the film.  Just because Cameron opted not to direct the film does not mean it's a bad film. Don't get hung up on the fact that Cameron didn't direct it, just sit back and enjoy the ride.  Thanks for reading my review, and be sure to check out my reviews for both previous films: 'The Terminator' and 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day'.",10,37,55,14 July 2003
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Cameron has a knack for making sequels better than the originals!
","If you didn't think it could get any better than 'The Terminator', then you haven't seen 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day'!  This is one of the best sequels of any movie ever done!  The story is fantastic, the acting is great, the special effects are ground-breaking and nearly perfect, the make-up effects are better than ever, and the action is non-stop!This is definitely one of those films that I wish I could erase my own memory and watch again for the first time!  There's no other way to put it, I love this movie!  I've probably seen this film more than any other.The story is perfectly told, working seemlessly with the original Terminator film.  The special effects are truly fantastic!  The design for the T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and the T-1000 are brilliant!Arnold Schwarzenegger plays the perfect T-800, as he did in the original Terminator film.  Robert Patrick will forever be ingrained in my memory as the T-1000, he IS the T-1000 and is surely the perfect choice for the role. Linda Hamilton does a particularly good job with her role.  The contrast between her 'Sarah Connor' of the first Terminator film and the 'Sarah Connor' of this film are very different, but with good reason.  She definitely worked out a lot for this role and pulls off her best performance to date (in my opinion).  The scene where she first sees the T-800 is EXCELLENT!  Edward Furlong, Earl Boen, Joe Morton, Jenette Goldstein and Xander Berkeley also pull off nice performances.What it all boils down to is this.  If you like the first film and have been putting off seeing this film, you need to stop wasting time and go see this film.  I wouldn't even bother renting it, just go buy it, it's worth it.  If you haven't seen any of the Terminator films, then I would recommend seeing the first film then seeing this one...although you could probably put the pieces together without having seen the first one...but nonetheless you should still see them both.  If you're one of the last remaining people on earth that hasn't seen this film, then I hope you enjoy it.  I know I did. Thanks for reading and be sure to read my review on 'The Terminator'.-LebowskiT1000",10,1,3,6 July 2003
Edward Scissorhands," Truly bizarre film, but good.
","The writers of this film, Tim Burton and Caroline Thompson, have quite a strange imagination.  But, I guess strange imaginations usually yield the best films.  This film is not a masterpiece in my opinion, but it was very fun to watch and had a lot of good stuff in it.  The story is nothing but bizarre from start to finish.  There are a few things in the film that aren't really explained to you, so I guess you just have to fill in the gaps with your own explanations.  For instance, I was unsure if Edward was a human put together from other human parts (like Frankenstein) or if he was a machine/android.  There were other aspects, like this, that weren't really explained, but that didn't hinder my enjoying of the film.The cast was very good.  I could not believe that Edward was played by Johnny Depp.  They did a fantastic job with his make-up, his wardrobe, and of course the scissorhands.  Johnny was fantastic as Edward.  Winona Ryder was great as well, she looks very different as a blonde, but I'm not complaining, she looked great!  Dianne Wiest was also great in the film. Anthony Michael Hall was quite a surprise to see in the film, and plays quite a different role than his well known 1980's films ('The Breakfast Club', 'Sixteen Candles', 'Weird Science').  He really pulled off the role rather well.  Alan Arkin was a perfect choice for Kim's (Winona Ryder) father.  I have always liked his acting, and he didn't let me down in this film.  Another notable cast-member is The Inventor, played by Vincent Price. I don't know much about him other than I know he is well known for his roles in horror films.  He was a perfect choice for the role of the inventor in this film, and did a great job.  The rest of the cast was very good as well.The music in this film, composed by Danny Elfman (as you can expect from a Tim Burton film) was excellent.  Elfman's work is quite funny to me because you can tell immediately that it is his work.  His music is so distinctive. I couldn't help but think of the first 'Batman' film when I heard the score in this film.  I really liked the score quite a bit and if you like Elfman's other work, then you'll more than likely like his score in this film as well.Like I said above, I wouldn't call this film a masterpiece, but it was definitely worth my time to watch it.  The film really is quite interesting, fun to watch, and quite touching at times.  This film has a lot to say about human nature and accepting outsiders and what not.  I'm not usually one for 'deeper meanings', but at least that's what I got from the film.  I'm not really sure that I would recommend this film to everyone, but if you like Tim Burton's other work or are just a fan of Johnny Depp or Winona Ryder, then go ahead and give it a chance.  I hope that you enjoy the film, thanks for reading.-Chris",7,1,2,14 December 2002
Spider-Man," Definitely Worth My Money
","I first heard this movie was coming out some time back in 2000 or maybe even 1999 and instantly got excited about it.  Since then I've tried VERY hard not to OVER-HYPE the movie as not to set myself up for disappointment, and let me tell you, it was TOUGH!  Anyhow, so I went and saw the movie on opening night (as I always do with movies of this caliber) and I must say that I WAS NOT let down.  I was VERY happy with the movie.  I wouldn't dare say it flawless, but it was very, very good.I'm no expert on Spider-man, but I think I know a good amount about the comic.  I was surprised that the movie seemed to follow the comic's story very closely.  There were a few things that I KNOW were changed, but otherwise, it was pretty much the same story as the comic.  ...And if I didn't mention it, that is a good thing.  I thought the story was great!I must admit that when I heard that Tobey Maquire was going to play Peter Parker/Spider-man, I was quite sceptical.  I just had to hope that he could pull it off.  In the end, I was VERY pleased with his performance.  He played the perfect Peter Parker and really worked out to get the physical look of Spider-man.  So, I have to give a 'thumbs up' to Tobey, he pulled it off and did a great job.As for the rest of the cast, I thought they were pretty good as well. Willem Dafoe did a good job with Norman Osbourne/Green Goblin, but I didn't really have any doubt that he could pull it off.  Kirsten Dunst was definitely a great addition to the film.  She did an EXCELLENT job as Mary Jane, and definitely looked the part.  I give her a 'thumbs up' too.  The rest of the cast were pretty much unknown to me, but I'll give them good props too.  As for the director, Sam Raimi, I have to say that I was also a bit sceptical of him taking on this project.  Don't get me wrong, I loved his other work, (Army Of Darkness, The Gift, For Love Of The Game, Darkman, etc), but I was still unsure if he could pull it off.  Well, in my opinion, he did it, Sam did a fantastic job and I gotta give him props too.  Oh, and I also loved that Sam threw in a cameo for his buddy Bruce Campbell (also knows as Ash from the 'Evil Dead' Series).  If you didn't catch him in the film, he was the ring announcer near the beginning of the film.The only complaint I have about the movie was SOME of the special effects. Sometimes they just looked incredible, but other times they looked VERY cartoon-ish.  But, I definitely wouldn't let something like that influence my overall liking of the film.All in all, I thought the film was great, and well worth the wait and the money I spent for the ticket.  I think I may just have to go see this one in the theater again before it's gone.  This movie is pretty much for everyone, I can definitely see kids liking it and grown-ups can appreciate it too. There wasn't anything in the movie that was overly kiddy.  Anyhow, I hope you like the movie as much as I did, and thanks for reading.-Chris",10,0,0,5 May 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Surprisingly Good
","I honestly can't tell you why, but when this movie came out, I wasn't really all that psyched about it.  I like Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle and pretty much the rest of the cast, as well as the Director Steven Soderbergh, but I just wasn't impressed from the previews.  So I finally got around to seeing the movie and thought it was a lot better than I thought it would be.The cast was really good in the film.  I'm not a huge fan of George Clooney, but I thought he did a good job in this film.  Andy Garcia, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Don Cheadle, Matt Damon, Scott Caan, Casey Affleck, Carl Reiner, Elliott Gould, and everyone else did a great job in the film.To my surprise, I thought the story was very interesting and did a great job of keeping me interested.  I don't think this movie would fall in the 'Comedy' genre, but this movie had some really great comedy in it.That's about all I can say about this movie.  Being a person that really didn't think it would be that good, it really is worth a peek.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",8,0,0,13 May 2002
Pearl Harbor," Good movie, not excellent, but worth my time.
","I can see why people wouldn't like this film, it's not for everyone.  To me it seems like director, Michael Bay, took his formula for 'Armageddon' and Cameron's 'Titanic' and tried to mold it into 'Pearl Harbor'.  But, despite that, I still liked the film a great deal.I do have a few complaints about the film though.  There were a number of particular shots in the film that were filmed in a very strange way, there was a slight blur to them.  I just don't get stuff like that, I didn't see why that was necessary, I think it kind of took away from the reality of what was going on.  My second complaint is the length of the film, the film was just too long.  Granted, it went by rather quickly, but still...there were a number of shots that were just redundant or unnecessary.  Personally, I also thought the character, Red, was pretty annoying with that stupid stuttering that he did.  One other thing I would have changed is that Betty died, wasn't too fond of that.  That's really about everything I have to complain about.The story was pretty good, although, definitely more of a love story than a war-story.  That right there is definitely going to anger some people.  Yes, there is lots of shooting and things getting blown up, but there's a great deal of romance to the film.  I thought the story was pretty interesting and fairly well done.The special effects are the reason enough to see this film, they are fantastic.  I cannot believe there are people on this site (and everywhere else) that claim the special effects were not well done!  You HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!!!  The special effects are just unbelievable!  I can't even imagine how much work must have gone into this film.The acting in the film was fine for my tastes.  There were a few cheesy scenes, but overall, I thought everybody did a great job.  As far as the cast goes, I thought it was excellent.  There was a surprising amount of familiar faces throughout this film.  I was a bit surprised to see Dan Aykroyd in this film, but in the end he pulled it off.  I won't really go into the cast, but all the players did a fine job.All I can say is that this is Michael Bay movie, so you can expect some cool action sequences and this is also a big love story.  So when/if you see this film (assuming you haven't already), treat it like one.  I thought it was a good film, with a lot of good stuff.  It's not the best film I've ever seen, or even the best film of 2001, but it was a good film.  When/If you see the film, I hope you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",10,4,8,17 October 2002
Hardball," Good Film.
","This film was not at all what I expected.  I thought the film was going to be a 'Mighty Ducks' sort of movie, more comedy and less drama, and be more of a movie for kids.  But I can definitely say, after seeing the film, that this is NOT a movie for little kids!  This movie was made for adults.  The story contains a lot of adult topics not a whole lot of comedy (there is some comedy though).  The story is quite touching at times as well.I thought the actors did a great job in this film.  I don't care what anyone says, Keanu Reeves is a great actor!  I thought he did a great job in this film and really doesn't get the respect that he deserves.  Diane Lane did a great job as always and looks just a beautiful as ever.  The rest of the cast was good as well.I wouldn't recommend this film to everyone, and certainly not to young children.  I'm not sure that children would like the film or even understand a lot of the issues in the film.  I would definitely recommend seeing this film to anyone that likes drama films about life in a big city.  I hope that you enjoy the film as much as I do.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",9,1,2,8 August 2002
Resident Evil," Pretty good for a zombie movie.
","First of all, let me start by saying that I am not a huge fan of the video games (or zombie films for that matter).  I own the three games for the playstation, but I could never really get into them.As for the movie, I thought it was fairly entertaining.  It had it's good points and low points, like most movies.  The story is nothing terribly intellectual, but it's interesting.  There are a lot of things you just have to accept and take for granted in the film.  Such as why on earth they would have created this virus in the first place, and what on earth that crazy dog beast thing was!  But, ok, I'll accept it.The only major complaint I have about the film is the music in the film.  I love type of music that they used in the film, in fact I own a lot of the music that was used in the film, but it seemed to me that most of the time the music was just overwhelming and out of place.The special effects in this film were surprisingly good.  I wasn't really impressed with the trailers for this film, but seeing them in context made it much better.The acting is nothing to get excited about.  It's good, but it's a zombie movie, so you can't really expect great performances.  Milla Jovovich looked really good in this film, and there are even a few times where Michelle Rodriguez cracked a smile and looked pretty.  She always seems to have scowl on her face, and her eyes are always up in her eyebrows.  The only other cast member I'd heard of was Eric Mabius, he did just fine with his role. Although, I did recognize Colin Salmon from the 2 (soon to be 3) most recent James Bond films.  He did a fine job as well.I would think that anyone that likes zombie movies and those type of films would like this one.  Also, if you're into gory films, you may want to check this out.  I hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading,-Chris",7,0,1,7 August 2002
Independence Day," What a movie!
","Independence Day is a great movie.  There's no way you can watch this movie and not think that the special effects alone are worth it.  Contrary to most people, I thought this movie had a great story and cool characters.  If you like Sci-fi at all, you should like this film.  I hope you enjoy it and thanks for reading.-Cortex",10,13,26,14 March 2000
The Princess Bride," Great Movie
","I know there are a million people out there that say this is the greatest movie ever.  I can't say that I agree, don't get me wrong, it's a great movie!  I would recommend this movie to just about everyone, but it isn't one of my all-time favorites.  Anyway, if you haven't seen this movie yet, why are you still reading this reviews?  The critics agree, it's definitely worth a look-see.  Hope you enjoy it.  -Cortex",10,1,2,26 August 2000
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Despite Popular Belief, A GREAT film!
","I really don't understand why so many people don't like this film. Sure it has it's flaws, but what movie IS perfect? I thought this was a spectacular sequel. It's pretty hard to beat the original, but I thought this one came pretty close to being just as good. I agree that the scene where the little girl did gymnastics and kicked the raptor out the window was one of the stupidest things Spielberg has ever done (in fact, if you ask me, they should have completely eliminated her character from the film). Also when Eddie Carr (Richard Schiff) yells to the people hanging on the rope and they respond with a fast-food order was another low point in the film. But these sort of scenes didn't ruin the film for me. Also, while I'm thinking about it, why do so many people have a problem with the T-Rex running around San Diego? That was AWESOME! I loved it! I really don't know why people have such a problem with that.As far as story goes, I thought it was a pretty well thought out story, nothing terribly complicated, but it got the job done. I don't really know what people are expecting, I went into the theater to see some dino's and I got what I wanted (and more). I did read the book before seeing the movie, even though I knew it would be drastically different, there were a few scenes that I had wished they'd put in the film, but you can't win 'em all.I thought the characters, acting and the cast were very good. I've always liked Jeff Goldblum, and he didn't let me down here. Other people that I believe deserve mention are Julianne Moore, Pete Postlethwaite, Richard Attenborough, Vince Vaughn, Peter Stormare, Richard Schiff, Joseph Mazello and Ariana Richards (even though those last two are barely in the film, but I was happy to see their cameos).As far as computer effects go...simply AMAZING!!! I would recommend seeing this film for the effects alone. They look even better than the original film, and there are a few scenes in particular that totally made the film for me. For instance, the scene when the two T-Rex's are attacking the car with Eddie Carr (Richard Schiff) is just phenomenal!!!All-in-all, I was VERY pleased with the movie and it wasn't a let down. If you liked the first one I think you should see this one and make your own conclusion instead of reading all these reviews and letting someone else make your decision for you. I hope you like the film as much as I did. ...Oh and be sure to watch Jurassic Park 3 after seeing this film. Despite what people may say, I thought it was an excellent installment to the films.Thanks for reading,-Chris",10,17,36,24 March 2002
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," What's the big fuss about?
","OK, first of all you need to understand that I like just about every movie I've ever seen. I can say that most movies have some redeeming value. There is maybe 20 to 30 movies that I can say have little to no redeeming value, and 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is on that list. I saw 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' a while back when it was in the theaters and I even have another review on the site (if you care to read it), and was less than stoked about it then.The other night I watched it again because I refused to believe that I didn't like it THAT much. Knowing myself, it sometimes takes me two viewings to really enjoy a movie, so I watched it again. After watching it for my second time, I'm sticking to my original belief, in fact watching it a second time made it even more clear to me why I didn't like it. I'm truly sorry for feeling this way, but 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen, I'm sorry, but I had to say it.First of all, I'm all about suspending reality, that's all in good fun, I understand, but it just doesn't work at all in this movie and is just absurd! If you are going to suspend reality you need to give the audience a reason to believe it. OK, so these people have learned a special type of martial art that allows them defy gravity at any time...c'mon, I need more than that. And secondly, it bugged the hell out of me that none of the bystanders were amazed that these warriors could defy gravity. If you were chasing someone and suddenly they jumped over a 30 foot wall, wouldn't you be a little confused or amazed? I think so. A perfect example of what I'd like to see is in 'The Matrix' when the Agent jumps to the next rooftop and the cop can't believe what he just saw.While I'm on the topic of 'The Matrix', I've had friends get upset that I liked the gravity defiance in 'The Matrix' and didn't like it in 'CTHD'. OK, these two are sooooo very different, Matrix gives you a more 'realistic' reason to believe that the characters can defy gravity and even then, the way it is filmed is WAY better than CTHD. You don't see people in Matrix floating over 30 foot walls, running on the sides of buildings or changing directions in mid air. ...And even when gravity is defied, it isn't for more than a second or two at most, whereas CTHD would do it for quite a bit longer.So, anyway, back to CTHD. The next thing that bothered me is the fight scenes. I'll give it this, they are well choreographed, but are you people really impressed by this? Two people are fighting and all of a sudden one of them starts to float away and the other fighter has to hold her to the ground so that she doesn't float off. LAME, LAME, LAME!!!Another thing, if you are going to have your characters defy gravity, make it true to itself. If gravity is out the window then why is a weapon going to be too heavy for Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) to fight with?Next on my agenda is the fight scene in the bamboo trees, this has got to be one of the DUMBEST, MOST ABSURD things I've EVER seen on film. I will admit however that the trees are beautiful and the scenery is nice, but the context is incredibly stupid.Oh, and one other thing, there are undoubtedly some people reading this thinking 'He didn't like it because it was subtitled', no, that is not the case, I loved 'Run Lola Run', 'Brotherhood of the Wolf' and 'Life Is Beautiful'.All in all, I thought the movie was horrible and it's going to be a long time before I watch this again, unless the other viewers don't mind me screaming at how silly the movie is. If you haven't seen it yet and you are still interested, by all means, see it, form your own opinion. I hope you enjoy it more than I did. Thanks for reading,-LebowskiT1000",3,0,1,9 August 2001
Good Will Hunting," A Wonderful Film!
","The first time I saw this film I liked it, but I didn't realize how good it was.  After a few more viewings I came to understand how great this film truly is.  The story is very interesting and quite entertaining.  The cast is excellent and the acting is very good.  The comedy is very well done and well placed throughout the film.  The only complaint I have about the film is the absurd amount of swearing in the film.  I agree that sometimes it is necessary, but there is a truly unnecessary amount of language in the film. But please, don't let that discourage you from seeing the film, it is a very good film.As I said above, the cast is excellent.  Matt Damon pulls off one of his best performances so far in his career.  Robin Williams does a fantastic job in this film and definitely deserved his Oscar!  Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver, Casey Affleck, Cole Hauser, and Stellan Skarsgard were all excellent supporting cast members!I would definitely recommend this film, as long as you can deal with the swearing.  If you do end up seeing the film, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",9,2,6,19 October 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A good movie, but a bit over-hyped and over-rated though.
","I honestly don't know what it is, but I'm really not all that impressed with these movies.  Don't get me wrong, I think they are good movies, and the special effects are nothing less than mind-blowing, but there is no way I could put either 'The Fellowship of the Ring' or 'The Two Towers' in my favorite 50 movies or so and they're both in the top 10 highest rated films on this site (at the present moment).  Maybe it is because I've never read the books, but then again I have a number of friends that haven't read the books and absolutely love these films.  So, I'm at a loss for answers.  The cast in the film is very good and everyone included deserves some notice.  Most notably: Ian McKellan, Christopher Lee, Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, John Rhys-Davies, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Orlando Bloom, Liv Tyler, Miranda Otto, Cate Blanchett, and Bernard Hill. They all did great jobs and pulled off great performances.  Director, Peter Jackson, deserves a great deal of praise too, you can definitely tell that a great deal of work went into this film.  I must say that Gollum looked truly impressive, in a special effects sense.  But, I have to get something off my chest.  He was SOOOOO ANNOYING!!!  I wanted Frodo and Sam to just kill him or leave him somewhere. If I hear 'My Precious' one more time I'm going to scream!!!  The high points for me in the film were the different animals and beasts in the film.  Some of them looked really cool and were done quite well, where other had some serious problems (if you ask me) and could have been done much better.  Another complaint I have about the film is the length.  I'm sorry, but this movie is just too long.  There are a number of things in the film they could have easily cut out (although I'm sure they didn't to please the hard-core fans of the books)...but I guess you can't please everyone, so I'll just shut up and deal with it.  On last thing I have to complain about that just didn't make sense is: How on earth did Gandalf and the Balrog end up fighting on top of that tower? One scene they're falling through the mountain, and then they're on top of this tower?  Did I miss something?  Oh well, maybe when/if I read the books it'll make more sense.  All in all, I thought it was a good film, but not as spectacular as everyone makes it out to be.  I'd still recommend seeing it though, but only if you've seen 'The Fellowship of the Ring' first.  You are going to REALLY lost if you don't see the previous film first.  In any case, I hope you enjoy the film.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",9,0,0,27 December 2002
The Elephant Man," Worth Watching!
","This was definitely a very interesting movie, and to think it's based on a true story makes it very touching.  There are many notable things about this film that make it so good.  I have to be honest though, I'm less than thrilled about the director.  I've now only seen two David Lynch movies and I hated the other one that I saw ('Wild At Heart').  There were a number of things that I thought could have definitely been directed better or just seemed out of place in the film, but I'm not going to let that ruin the movie for me.  I'm very curious as to why David Lynch decided to make this film in black and white.  I know a lot of people love black and white, but to me it just seems to take away from the realism of it.  Also, to me it's basically having the technology to make it better and not using it.  But in any case, it didn't really bother me, I still enjoyed the film immensely.  The story is actually very moving and it really makes you think about how much you take for granted in life.  The acting is just great, you can't really go wrong with Anthony Hopkins, and John Hurt pulls off a great performance.  I was very happy to see Kenny Baker in the film, he's probably best known as R2-D2 in the Star Wars series.  In case you don't know, he's the guy inside R2-D2 controlling him.  The pacing is very good and does a great job of getting you interested in the story.  There isn't really much else I can say other than it's definitely a good film, and you should see it if you haven't already.  Oh, and I should also say something about the make-up.  I thought John Hurt (John Merrick aka The Elephant Man) had some incredible make-up on for the part, and it just really impressed me.  I hope you enjoy the film as much as I do.  Thanks for reading.-Chris",9,1,1,21 February 2002
Amadeus," A bit too long, but good.
","I can't say that this is a great movie, but I did enjoy it.  It had it's good parts and it's bad parts.  I think the only major complaint I have about the movie is the length of it.  The film isn't bad, but it's VERY long!  Oh...and I have to complain about Mozart's (Tom Hulce) laugh.  Could it have been any more annoying?  I'm sure that's what Milos Forman was going for, but a little too annoying if you ask me.I must admit that I'm a bit surprised this film won an Oscar for Best Picture, sure it was good, but Best Picture?  Well, ok, I guess so.  I was also VERY surprised that the F. Murray Abraham won an Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role.  I thought he did a fine job, don't get me wrong, but I didn't find his acting to anything Oscar worthy.If you're into classical music, then you should most definitely see this film.  I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone that can't sit through a film more than 2 hours long and isn't into films of this type.  For those of you out there that do end up seeing the film, I hope you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",7,1,5,22 August 2002
K-19: The Widowmaker," Great Film
","What makes this an amazing film is that it is based on a true story.  While watching this film, I couldn't help but think that all these characters actually existed.  Knowing that these people in the film actually existed makes the film more impact-full.I have to be honest though, I was less than impressed with the previews for the film.  I wanted to see it because of Harrison Ford, he's one of the best actors out there, so I had to see it, but the previews just didn't do it justice.The actors in the film do a great job throughout the film.  The only two faces that I recognized in the film are Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson, who both did a great job in the film.  The rest of the cast was very good too.If you're into films involving heroism and war films, than hopefully you'll like this film.  I thought it was a great film, and I hope you will feel the same.

Back to the Future Part III," Another Great Sequel to a Great Series
","It's hard to believe that someone could make a third-installment that is just as good or at least pretty close to the other two films.  I really liked this film and it is a great continuation of part II.  I'm not one to like westerns, but this movie really pulls it off (of course, this isn't really much of a western, just a western setting)!  Robert Zemeckis is definitely one of the best directors out there and he doesn't let you down with this film.  The acting in this film is great, the story is incredible and the special effects are superb.  I have to say that I'm really impressed with Michael J. Fox and Thomas F. Wilson in these films because of how many different characters they play and how many different versions of the same characters they play.  There really isn't much I can say other than 'See This Movie!!!  And if you haven't already, see Part I and II.'  This is definitely a great finale to a great trilogy.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",10,1,1,26 February 2002
Men in Black II," Great Sequel!!!
","I'm always scared of sequels, especially when it is a sequel of a film that I really liked.  I did however take comfort in knowing that Barry Sonnenfeld directed the sequel (and original) to 'The Addams Family', so I already knew that he was good with sequels, but I was still scared, this is Men in Black we're taking about.  Well, Barry Sonnenfeld pulled it off, he made a great sequel to a great film.I wouldn't dare say it was flawless, but it was pretty good.  There were some major problems I had with the film, but nothing I'll lose sleep over. One thing that didn't sit well with me is that Rita (Rosario Dawson) was somehow all of a sudden wearing the bracelet in question.  I was quite a bit confused on that whole scene where they discovered what they wanted was the bracelet.  Either I missed something or that was a VERY badly told part of the story.  Also, I hated when Z (Rip Torn) was flipping around like a crazy monkey and kicking the heck out of Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle).  What the heck was that?  There were a number of other little things that I really didn't like about the film, but overall it was GREAT!  The comedy was great, the story was funny and interesting and the special effects were phenomenal! Although, there were a few aliens that were SOOOO stupid looking, but I can deal.The cast was great, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones do a great job of feeding off each other and make a great pair.  I was also impressed with Lara Flynn Boyle, Rosario Dawson and Patrick Warburton.  Johnny Knoxville did a decent job too.  Also, I must say that I was very happy to see Tony Shalhoub reprising his role as Jeebs.If you liked the first Men In Black film, then there is a pretty good chance that you'll like this one too.  I hope you enjoy the film as much as I do. Happy viewing, and thanks for reading,-Chris",8,0,0,9 July 2002
Rules of Engagement," Worth Watching.
","I'm usually not one for political/court-room movies, but this one is done quite well in my opinion.  The opening sequence in the film is superb and really pulls you into the story.  I thought the film had a very interesting story line.I'm not a huge fan of William Friedkin, the only other movie of his that I've seen is 'The Exorcist', but I thought this film was directed quite nicely.  I'm definitely going to keep my eyes open for his future work.The cast in this film is quite good.  Tommy Lee Jones plays the usual likeable character.  Samuel L. Jackson pulls off a very nice performance, some of the dialogue of his is very powerful and intense.  Guy Pearce does a good job with his role.  Ben Kingsley, Bruce Greenwood, Anne Archer, Blair Underwood, Philip Baker Hall, Nicky Katt and Ryan Hurst also pull off good performances.If you like films like 'A Few Good Men' or just political/court-room/war films, then I would hope that you'd enjoy this film.

Dumb and Dumber," Excellent Comedy! 101 Minutes of Pure Fun!!!
","This has got to be one of the funniest films of all time!  I absolutely love this film from the first second to end credits.  Peter and Bobby Farrelly did a fantastic job for their first directing gig!  What a great way to start out their career.  The comedy in this film is nothing you have to think about, it's just good fun and just plain 'dumb' humor, hence the name of the film.  If you're looking for a film to just sit back, relax and have a good time with, then this is your film!Jim Carrey has got to be one of the funniest comedians of his time!  I don't care what anyone says, he's a fantastic actor and really knows how to get the laughs.  Jeff Daniels also pulls of a phenomenal performance.  He really deserves some credit for this role, I don't think anyone is going to argue that Jim Carrey is the main draw for this film.  Jeff has to play someone that is going to be with Jim Carrey for the bulk of the film and will have to get just as many laughs as Jim.  ...And Jeff Daniels pulls it off!  He gets just as many laughs as Jim and was an excellent choice for the role. Lauren Holly, Teri Garr, Mike Starr, Charles Rocket, Karen Duffy, and everyone else does a great job with their roles as well.  The one other guy that I have to mention is Harland Williams.  This guy is excellent!  I was sad that he got so little screen time, but he plays the part perfectly (he's the cop that pulls over Harry and Lloyd and drinks the 'beer').The story in this film is nothing terribly complicated, but it is very well done and well thought out.  Everything about this film is well done and very funny.  I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that likes Jim Carrey, if you aren't a fan of Jim Carrey, then I don't know what to tell you.  If you see the film, I hope you enjoy it.  Thank you for reading,-Chris",10,1,3,9 October 2002
Jerry Maguire," Very Touching, Very Funny, Very Good Film
","I have to admit that the first time I saw this film, I wasn't too terribly impressed.  I'm not really sure why, cause I've seen it quite a many times since then and I've loved it every time since.  There are so many good things about this film, that you really ought to see this film.  The acting is great, the characters are great, the story is interesting, the film is beautifully directed, the comedy is hilarious, everything is excellent in this film.All the cast members deserve a great deal of respect for their roles.  Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr. are absolutely fantastic throughout the film! Rene Zellweger, Bonnie Hunt, Regina King, Kelly Preston, Jerry O'Connell, Jay Mohr, Todd Louiso, Jonathan Lipnicki and Beau Bridges all did a great job as well, and I really liked all of their characters a great deal. Needless to say, the acting is top-notch.The comedy in this film is something I really think I ought to mention.  The comedy is so well done throughout the film, there are a number of times where I found myself just cracking up.  Usually it was just the way something was said, or who was saying it.  The humor is most-definitely NOT any type of graphical humor, you aren't going to see any slapstick or gross-out humor in this film, so if that's what you're looking for you might want to look elsewhere.Well, I really think you should do yourself a favor and see this film! Although, be fore-warned, this is a romantic/comedy/drama, so brace yourself.  It's really good though!  Anyhow, I really hope that you do see this film, and hope you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",9,3,8,27 August 2002
Rudy," Inspirational Movie
","This is a great film about going for your dreams and never giving up.  No matter who tells you that you can't do it, no matter how unlikely the chances are, no matter what, make sure you go for your dreams and do everything that you can make them come true.Sean Astin delivers one of his best performances to date.  He plays the character of Rudy Ruettiger perfectly!  He was an excellent choice for the role and he deserves a great deal of credit for his work (as does the true life Rudy).  The rest of the cast was quite good as well; Jon Favreau, Ned Beatty, Lili Taylor, Charles Dutton, Robert Prosky, and Vince Vaughn (in one of his first roles).  All of the supporting cast was excellent.If you like inspirational movies, or just movies about football (although there is much more to this movie than just football), then I highly recommend you see this film.  I hope that you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",8,58,67,19 November 2002
Men in Black," Great Movie!
","I don't know what it is, but the first time I saw this film I was expecting more of a serious sci-fi movie.  But after a few repeat viewings I came to realize this is a comedy with sci-fi in it, not a sci-fi movie with comedy in it.The story is quite interesting, and very smart.  I love that the tabloids are best place to do research for MIB agents.  That's great!  There are a number of things like this that really got me laughing.  The comedy in the film is great from start to finish.  There's a few bad jokes, but the bulk of them are really good.The characters are just incredible in the film.  The interaction between Tommy Lee Jones (K) and Will Smith (J) is perfect (and hilarious), they're complete opposites, which makes them so great!  Another great addition to the film is Vincent D'Onofrio (Edgar), his acting in the film was just perfect!  And let's not forget the beautiful Linda Fiorentino (Dr. Weaver), she did a great job in the film too.  I think Rip Torn and Tony Shaloub deserve some honorable mentions as well.The special effects in the film are absolutely mind-blowing!  The scene where the Bug's ship is crash landing on earth and hits Edgar's truck is superb!  Then the entire end scene where J and K shoot down Edgar Bug's ship and then Edgar tears off his skin and becomes the bug...AMAZING!  Nearly flawless special effects!If you're in the mood for a good comedy/sci-fi movie, you should definitely watch this film!  There are so many good things about this film, you really ought to give it a shot.  I deeply hope that you enjoy the film as much as I do, but remember it may take a few repeat viewings.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",9,0,0,10 June 2002
There's Something About Mary," Not a movie to bring home to mom and dad...but it's great!
","This is definitely one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  Everything about this film is great!  The story is surprisingly both sweet and hilarious at the same time.  The story is absolutely fantastic and incredibly well written, the story flows very smoothly from scene to scene and makes every character important to the overall story.  What makes this such a great story are all the great characters in the film, all played by fantastic actors.  It isn't often that you have a truly great comedy film with such a great cast.The star is obviously Cameron Diaz, playing one of my personal favorite roles to date.  She's such a beautiful actress and such a good actress.  Ben Stiller, what can I say?  Nothing less than a STUD!!!  I absolutely love his character, he plays such a genuinely likable guy.  Ben's little movements and reactions completely make the movie for me.  Lee Evans really shows off his acting talent in this film as well, just amazing, that's all I have to say.  Matt Dillon, Jeffery Tambor, Lin Shaye, Chris Elliot, Keith David and everyone else also play their roles flawlessly.  I also feel that I have to mention W. Earl Brown, who plays the part of 'Warren'.  This guy is a truly fantastic actor!  It's too bad that comedies are exempt from receiving Oscars (well, not always), this guy plays a phenomenal supporting character. There are also some great cameos and minor roles, played by Richard Tyson, Rob Moran, Harland Williams, Sarah Silverman, Richard Jenkins and Brett Favre.Those Farrelly Brothers are nothing less than comedic geniuses!!!  This is just another great comedy to add to their impressive list of comedy films. Keep up the good work guys!The comedy in this film is pretty much what you'd expect from a Farrelly Brothers film, but this one REALLY pushes the envelope.  There is a lot of very 'dirty' or 'questionable' humor in this film...but it's just plain hilarious.  I would strongly urge you to see some of their earlier work first, and if you like any of those films, then give this one a shot.  This is most definitely not a comedy for everyone, but I sure found it funny as all hell.I truly hope that you can respect this film for what it is and I hope, even more so, that you laugh just half as much as I did watching this film. Thanks for reading,-Chris",10,1,2,19 February 2003
Mission: Impossible," One of my all-time favorite movies!
","This is, without a doubt, one of my favorite films of all time!  I'll never forget watching this film for the first time with a good buddy of mine, afterward we couldn't stop talking about it and spent a great deal of time explaining plot points to each other.  We finally decided that we just had to see it again, so we did and all of our questions were answered and our theories proven correct.The story is nothing less than superb!  Every time you think you have the movie figured out they throw you for another loop, but not too much as to get you irritated trying to figure out the plot.  This is most definitely a film that deserves at least two viewings before you can truly understand and appreciate the story.  The characters are all excellent as well, although I was sad to see Jack Harmen (Emilio Estevez) get killed off so quickly, I liked his character.The cast is extraordinary!  Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt perfectly!  Jon Voight was the perfect choice for Jim Phelps.  Emmanuelle Beart was very good in her role.  Henry Czerny was superb as Kittridge.  Jean Reno was an excellent addition to the cast.  Ving Rhames was a very nice touch and really added a lot to the film.  Kristin Scott Thomas was lovely as always, although played a somewhat minor role in the greater scheme of things. Vanessa Redgrave was another nice addition to the cast.  And finally, Emilio Estevez (as I mentioned above), played a small role, and played it quite well.I can see why some of the big fans of the show wouldn't like this film due to certain plot points that I can't give away, so if you are a big fan of the show, be forewarned, you may have some issues with the film. Personally, I've never seen a single episode of the old television show, so I had absolutely no frame of reference.  Which, I believe, put me in a better position to appreciate the story.I feel that I have to mention the action scenes in this film! SPECTACULAR!!!  The scene where Kittridge and Hunt are talking in the restaurant...just AWESOME!  The entire last 20 minutes of the film...UNBELIEVABLE!!!  The filming, the action, the special effects and stunts alone make this film worth watching (but luckily, there is so much more to appreciate).If you are a fan of Tom Cruise, or just crime/mystery/action films in general, be sure to check this one out (at least twice).  This is honestly one of my top 20 films of all time, I truly hope that you will enjoy this film.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",10,30,41,17 January 2003
Groundhog Day," One of Bill Murray's best films to date!!!
","I'm so happy to see that this film has such a high rating on this web-site, because this is one of the few films that I think I can honestly say has NOTHING in it that I would change.  The story is excellent, the cast is fantastic, the acting is superb, the comedy is right on, this film ROCKS!!!Bill Murray pulls off one of his best performances to date (along side 'What About Bob?' and 'Ghostbusters').  It's amazing how he's such a b**tard in the beginning of the film, but you still like his character in a weird way, and by the end of the film you really do like the person he has become. Andie MacDowell also pulls off one of her better performances.  Throughout the film you really like her character and she's not that hard on the eyes either.  Chris Elliot, Brian Doyle-Murray and Stephen Tobolowsky also deserve some credit for their work in this film, they both play their parts quite well.  Also, I feel I should mention Harold Ramis, he did a superb job directing this film, he really is an under-appreciated director.  Great job Harold!As I mentioned above, the comedy in this film is right on.  There are so many scenes that my friends and I love repeating to each other and get us laughing just thinking about them.  If you like Bill Murray, then I'm sure you'd like this film.  I would definitely recommend this film to just about anyone, it's really a fantastic film.  Do yourself a favor and go see this film, I truly hope that you enjoy it as much as I do.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",10,0,0,7 October 2002
Rocky," Worth seeing.
","This is probably one of the most well known movies of all time, and I finally got around to seeing this film some time earlier this year (2003).  I can't believe I consider myself a movie fan without having seen any of the films in the Rocky series.  I decided the time had come to remedy that situation.To be honest, I thought 'Rocky' was a fine movie, although I am surprised it won best picture.  These days, the chance of a film centering around a sport of any kind has virtually no chance of even getting nominated for an Oscar.  I guess that just shows how times have changed.To my surprise, 'Rocky' was a rather slow-paced film.  The beginning and the end are pretty exciting, but most of the film is full of dialogue and situations that lead up to the main event.All of the actors in the film did a fine job with their roles.  Carl Weathers as the heavy- weight champion, Apollo Creed (what an awesome name!) is great.  Sylvester Stallone pulls off a rather nice performance, somewhat annoying at times, but I would credit that to the character, not the actor.  Burgess Meredith pulls off probably the best performance in the film.  Talia Shire and Burt Young are very good as well.In the end, I'd say this was a good film, and certainly worth watching, for a number of reasons, but I wouldn't call it a must see.  The main reason I see for watching this film is to understand all the references that are made to this film in other films and to see Sylvester Stallone in one of his first roles.  Thanks for reading.",8,0,0,7 October 2003
Pulp Fiction," One of the worst movies I've ever seen!!!
","What is the big deal with this movie?  The movie SO boring, uninteresting, and full of a bunch of moronic and trashy characters.  I just don't get why people like this film so much.  It truly saddens me that this film has, for some god-awful reason, made it into IMDB's top 250 (and currently top 20). This film is most definitely in my bottom 250.Here are some of the many problems I had with this film:The scene where Bruce Willis' character was first introduced is one of the most visually painful scenes I've ever seen, I was ready to turn the movie off right there.  The camera just sits there on Bruce Willis' face and doesn't move for what seems to be an eternity.  What on earth was Quentin thinking?The best way to describe this movie is 'just a bunch of STUFF', there's no real plot here and the story doesn't go anywhere?  I found it really hard to give a SH*T about any of the characters, and I couldn't care less if any of them got shot or killed.What was with that scene where Uma Thurman's character says 'Don't be a square' and she forms a little square with her hands (If you haven't seen the movie then you won't know what I mean)?  That was so STUPID!!!  I just don't get stuff like that.  Too weird for me. ...And people call this a comedy?  Where the f&*k is the comedy?  Is it supposed to be funny when they go over the speed bump and shoot the guy in the back seat?  That isn't funny, that's SICK!  The only part that I laughed at was when John Travolta and Sam Jackson were talking about eating pork/bacon.  I thought that was a pretty funny conversation, but other than that I didn't find the movie funny at all.I'll never say 'don't waste you're time' while referring to a movie, cause everybody has different tastes. So if you feel so inclined, go ahead and watch it, but I HATED it.  I hope you enjoy it more than I ever will. Thanks for putting up with my ranting and raving,-Chris",2,48,113,21 February 2002
When Harry Met Sally...," One of the best romantic comedies ever!
","Not too long ago I finally got around to seeing this film, I'd heard so much about it that I had to see it. After seeing it the first time I thought it was good, but I have to say that I liked it even more on my second viewing. The film is absolutely wonderful! The story is very amusing and keeps you interested in the characters from start to finish.I literally couldn't wait to see what would happen in the next scene. This is one of those movies that goes by very quickly. I think that's a sign of a good movie, when you just can't believe that you're already an hour or so into the movie. The story really flows nicely from scene to scene.The cast is great in the film as well. Billy Crystal pulls off one of his best performances, and has a slew of great jokes throughout the film. Meg Ryan looks as beautiful as ever and has such a cute way about her. Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher definitely deserve a great deal of credit too, they both did superb jobs as well. Director Rob Reiner did a great job with the film, keep up the good work Rob.If you're into romantic comedies, then you definitely should see this film. Even if you aren't really into the whole romantic part of it, the comedy is great and worth seeing. I would most definitely recommend seeing this film.I hope you like it. Thanks for reading,-Chris",10,160,183,1 August 2002
Ice Age," Great Movie!
","I thought this was a really good movie.  It's got an interesting story (nothing terribly original though, but hey it's a kid's movie), it's got great comedy, great voice-talents, great visuals and more.  There were a few scenes were I found myself laughing pretty hard.  I loved all the voice actors in the movie, Ray Romano, Denis Leary, John Leguizamo, Goran Visnjic, and Jack Black.  I have to say that I wasn't terribly fond of John Leguizamo's lisp thing in the film, but I can deal with it and won't make too much of a big deal of it.  It was kind of funny for about a minute, then it just got annoying.  But like I said after a while you get used to it and just live to deal with it.  I really liked the little rodent that kept appearing throughout the movie, he was a great little tid-bit in the film. Overall, I liked the movie very much and found it to be very enjoyable.  I hope that you like it as much as I did.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",10,2,4,17 March 2002
Army of Darkness," One the funniest movies I've ever seen!
","I remember when this film just came out in the theater, I didn't know anything about the Evil Dead films and in fact hadn't even heard of them. From the previews I had ZERO desire to see this film.  The years went by and in late 2000 or maybe 2001 I finally decided to watch it, cause I'd heard so much about it and just couldn't take it anymore, I had to see what the fuss was about.  I was NOT disappointed!  This is probably one of the funniest movies I've ever seen!!!This movie is definitely not for everyone though.  The comedy in this film is VERY odd, so I could understand if someone didn't find it funny at first. First thing you need to keep in mind is that this movie IS NOT trying to be serious, and most definitely doesn't take itself seriously.  The movie is just plain weird, but that's what makes it so great.  You really can't explain this movie to someone that hasn't seen it, you just need to see it for yourself.Also, if you didn't already know this, this is the 3rd installment to a series.  Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 are the first two installments, then Army Of Darkness.  You don't even need to see the first two to understand what's going on or anything like that.  In fact, to this day I still haven't seen Evil Dead.  When I watched Army of Darkness, I hadn't seen either Evil Dead or Evil Dead 2.  Since then, I have seen Evil Dead 2, but neither film is a prerequisite for this film.Also this film has an enormous amount of quotable lines.  Bruce Campbell is THE MAN!  The way he says stuff is just great!Well, I truly hope that you'll watch this movie.  But watch it with an open mind and remember that this IS a STUPID movie, but it's supposed to be.

Scream 2," Another Teen Slasher Movie, it's ok.
","I'm not a fan of the teen-slasher genre, or horror in it's entirety for that matter, that's probably why it's taken me nearly 5 years to finally sit down and watch this sequel.I have to admit that I wasn't really a huge fan of the original 'Scream', well, it was ok, but I didn't think it was anything great.  So, I had pretty low expectations of this film and on top of that, I've had a number of friends say that this is the worst in the series.  Needless to say, my expectations had hit rock-bottom!After seeing the film, I must say that I thought it was pretty good.  I don't know where I'd put this film compared to the first one, probably about the same likability for me.  I thought this film had a lot of good things going for it, I thought the story was pretty good and really kept you guessing.  I also REALLY liked the comedy in this film, David Arquette and Jamie Kennedy crack me up!  The only major complaint I have about this film is that they killed my favorite character in the series!  I won't give it away for those of you that haven't seen it, but the choices are pretty limited, there were only 5 or so actors that were in both 'Scream' and 'Scream 2' (and only one of them dies in part 2, so when you see the film you'll know who I'm talking about).The acting was pretty good in this film, I really enjoyed the cast in this film.  There were a lot of familiar faces and a lot of cameos: Tori Spelling, Heather Graham, Sarah Michelle Gellar, David Warner, Wes Craven, Joshua Jackson, Portia de Rossi, Omar Epps, and perhaps some others that I missed.  The core cast was really good as well: Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Jerry O'Connell, Liev Schreiber and everyone else. Great cast!I guess if you're into teen-slasher films and liked the first 'Scream' film, then you should definitely check this out.  I can't promise you'll like it as much as the first film, as most of my friends didn't, but you never know. Well, if you do see the film, I hope you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",7,1,2,23 August 2002
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Was good, could have been great.
","After watching this film several times now and having let enough time go by to really let the film sink in, I feel I can now write a well-rounded, as objective as possible review of the film. So here it goes...Let me start by saying that I liked the film a great deal and it's 'fun-factor' was quite good, but the film really missed the mark, in my opinion. While the film was good, it could have been spectacular.Let's start with the acting. I can't say it was great and it wasn't ALL bad, but there was certainly nothing to write home about. Hayden Christiensen is nothing spectacular and comes off as rather laughable at times. Natalie Portman is normally quite good, was just OK in this film. As for Ewan McGreggor, I'll say this, his acting was well executed, but his dialog could have been much better. Samuel L. Jackson....well...he's a great actor and I love most of his films, but I sincerely believe that he should never have been cast for any of the SW films, he just doesn't fit with the character, nor can I take him seriously as a Jedi. I truly believe he just didn't work well with the role and the role would have been better suited for someone else. Ian McDirmid was just awful in this film. Normally he is a fine actor, even in the previous SW films and his other works. There were times where I thought he was fine, but there were many times were I couldn't help but cringe. I just wasn't impressed with his portrayal of Palpatine/The Emperor in this film. Everyone else in the film did a fine job.Now for the story. I'm sorry, but it was just bad! It could have EASILY been MUCH, MUCH better. I didn't buy into the reasons why Anakin became Darth Vader and turned to the Dark Side, it felt WAY too forced. Not that it really matters, but this is what I would have done (and was hoping for): Anakin becomes increasingly impatient with the Jedi council and becomes more and more unpredictable (in the vain of him killing Count Dooku...I did like that), Padme becomes fearful of Anakin and decides it would be best for her (and her unborn child{ren}) to leave Anakin (with Obi-Wan's help). She proceeds to leave and of course Anakin wants to know where she is and what happened to her. Obi-Wan and the Jedis try to help Anakin understand that due to his actions she does not feel safe with him, etc... This, of course, only makes Anakin more angry. Then somehow amidst a fight or something Padme is severely injured and ultimately dies (unbeknownst to Anakin). Then Obi-Wan tries to tell Anakin that she has been killed and he does not believe him and is sure that he is simply trying to keep Anakin from Padme, so this begins his journey to the Dark Side, he begins to hate Jedi's for keeping him from his love. Who do you think would be there to help him find Padme? A certain Darth Sidious perhaps? Anakin then begins hunting down the Jedis, hell-bent on finding Padme, refusing to believe that she (and their child) has died...and when the Jedi's don't give him the answer he wants to hear...he kills them. This could also lead to a kick-ass fight between him and Yoda, where he really works Yoda, and thus forces Yoda to go into hiding until a match of Anakin/Vader's abilities can be found (this could take place after the fight between Obi-Wan and Anakin, so he's already become a cyborg, got the Vader outfit and had time to develop his Dark Side abilities). OK, so that's Episode III as done by LebowskiT1000. You may disagree with me that this would be a much better story, but it really doesn't matter, cause I seriously doubt Lucas is going to let me re-direct the film.Let's talk about the directing and dialog. There are certain scenes, such as the scene where Mace Windu attempts to arrest Palpatine that were excruciatingly bad, everything in the scene was terrible, the directing, the dialog, the acting...just plain bad. Why did Palpatine's own electrical storm cause his face to get all wrinkled up? That was dumb! I always assumed that the reason he looked the way he did in ESB and ROTJ was because he was REALLY old (as he would be). Assume he's probably in his mid-to-late 60's in TPM, then he'd be at least in his late 90's to early 100's in ESB and even older in ROTJ, so of course he's going to look all wrinkled up and old. So, in my opinion you could have omitted the entire electrical-storm-wrinkling plot-point and it would have been a better film. There are many other scenes where the dialog/directing was less than stellar, but I'll leave it to you to find them an dissect them.The bright and shining star in the film is the special effects. This is one thing that was really well done and if you disagree, then I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to disagree with you. The special effects are simply amazing in this film, all the CG worlds look great, the CG characters look fantastic and there really is nothing to complain about. General Grevious looks fantastic, by the way.In the end, I thought the film was quite fun and worth my time, but it was VERY disappointing, it had the potential to be a fantastic bridge between AOTC and ANH and to just be an overall great film, but due to some bad choices in writing, directing and dialog, the mark was missed. Having said all that, I do strongly insist you watch the film yourself and come to your own conclusions, I hope you enjoy it. Thanks for reading my review/comment/rant.",8,0,1,9 March 2006
The Waterboy," One of Adam Sandler's best to date!!!
","'The Waterboy' is definitely one of my favorite Adam Sandler films, just as good as 'Happy Gilmore', 'The Wedding Singer', 'Big Daddy' and 'Mr. Deeds'. If you are a fan of Adam Sandler, then you're sure to like this film.Adam Sandler's films all seem to have the same sort of comedy, but at the same time all have a different flavor of their own.  The comedy in this film is definitely odd, sometimes outright hilarious and sometimes just plain odd and even a few times quite dumb...but it's all good, it's an Adam Sandler film, I still enjoyed it.All the actors in this film did a fine job.  Adam Sandler does a good job as usual, doing pretty much exactly what you would expect.  I am usually less than fond of Kathy Bates' acting, but she did a pretty good job in this film and was just right for the role.  Henry Winkler was an excellent touch, he was also great in the film.  Fairuza Balk was also a nice touch, and looked quite nice as well.  Rob Schneider has a very nice cameo in the film, he was a pleasant surprise.  The rest of the supporting cast was excellent.All in all, if you liked Adam Sandler on Saturday Night Live and/or liked any of his other films, I would think that you would like this one as well. All I can say is give it a shot.  Hope you like it, thanks for reading,-Chris",9,2,6,11 January 2003
Scream," An ok film...for horror.
","First of all, I have to admit that I am not a fan of the horror genre, there are a few that I really like, but for the most part...not a fan.  With that said, let me get on with the review.I thought 'Scream' was an ok film, it had a lot of good things going for it, but there were a few things that just didn't sit well with me.  Overall, I thought the story was actually pretty good and quite suspenseful.  The comedy was also just spectacular in the film.  The best character (hands-down, no contest) in the film is Randy (played by Jamie Kennedy)! His character and the way he says things totally made the movie for me.Alone with Jamie Kennedy, the rest of the cast was pretty good as well. Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Skeet Ulrich, Neve Campbell, Rose McGowan, Matthew Lillard, Drew Barrymore, and Henry Winkler all did great jobs with their characters.Like I mentioned earlier, the story is actually pretty good in this film. The only complaint that I have is that there are a number of murders and killings that take place in the film that are completely useless (I guess that defines a horror film).  For instance, it is never explained why the killer kills Drew Barrymore and what she has to do with the entire story....maybe that's cause she DOESN'T!!!  I just don't like that they always seem to throw in a killing here and there that have nothing to do with the story, just an excuse to have another gruesome death scene.  Oh well, you can't win them all.  There were a few other problems I had with the film here and there, but nothing I can't deal with.If you like horror films, and especially if you like teen-slasher films, then you should definitely see this film.  If you are like me, and just like the occasional horror film, then you may also want to check out this film. If you do see the film, I hope you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading.-Chris",6,1,2,27 August 2002
Halloween," Why is this film so popular?
","Before reading this review, you have to understand that I am really not a fan of the horror genre on the whole.  Most horror films are boring, plot-less, and just all around uninteresting.  So, that is probably why it has taken me 24 years of life to finally get around to watching the first of the Halloween films.  ...And on top of my dislike for horror films, I also have a strong dislike for John Carpenter.  He's had a few good ones here and there, but some of his films could have been great, but he screwed them up (in my opinion).  Anyhow on with the review.I realize that this film as made in 1978, so it's somewhat hard to gauge the scary-ness of this film.  Personally, I didn't find the film to be very scary at all, creepy ok, but scary no.  I guess I can see how this would be scary back in the late 1970's or early 1980's, but not so much today.The plot was just terrible in my opinion.  I was expecting more of a back-story for Michael Myers, but all I got was that he was a psycho little kid and he grew into a psycho adult.  Not terribly interesting.  I don't really know what I was expecting, but whatever it was, I didn't get it.  I was also expecting some sort of explanation as to why he wears the white mask.  But...all I got was that it was Halloween, so it was fitting for the killer to be wearing a mask.  Also, while I'm thinking of it.  Why did they credit the character of Michael Myers as 'The Shape'?  STUPID!!!  I'm sorry, but that is a retarded name for the killer, just call him what he is, Michael Myers.I've read numerous reviews saying how much they loved John Carpenter's score.  I really feel like the minority here, but you have got to be kidding me?!?!  John Carpenter is a terrible composer!  I can't believe people actually like his so-called music.  There were actually a few times I wanted to mute the tv because the music was so awful.The acting is this film was nothing spectacular.  Donald Pleasence was ok, but nothing great.  Just another horror movie actor to me, they're all pretty much the same.  Jamie Lee Curtis was pretty good in her role, but again, nothing great.  I've never heard of any of the other cast members, both good and bad acting.  Typical horror movie acting, what can I say?I don't really think I'm in a position to recommend this film to anyone, but if you're a fan of horror movies that you probably ought to see this.  I only say that because obviously a lot of horror fans like this film, so perhaps you'll like it too.  There's also a huge number of allusions to this film in other films, so it's good to be able to spot them.  If you do end up seeing the film, I hope you enjoy it more than I did.

Back to the Future Part II," One of the best sequels I've ever seen.
","This is without a doubt one of the best sequels I've ever seen.  The story is absolutely incredible and the special effects are top-notch.  The look of the futuristic world is incredible and the look of the 1950's is also great! There really isn't enough good things I can say about this movie!  It's absolutely incredible.SPOILERS AHEADThere is one complaint/question I have though, if Biff got a hold of the Almanac and Time Machine in 2015, went back to 1955 to give himself the Almanac, and then went back to 2015 to return the time machine to Marty and Doc Brown...wouldn't he be in a different 2015?  I guess it can be argued that Marty, Jennifer and Doc would still be at their future house regardless of the world changing around them due to Biff's traveling through time, but I don't know, I guess it just didn't sit right with me.  I hope what I'm trying to say makes sense.  Time travel is such an 'unstable' subject, there are so many paradox's that can occur.  But anyhow, I'm not going to let this one little plot point ruin the whole movie for me.  It's still a great movie and should definitely be seen.One other thing I'd like to say is that the ending of this film is without a doubt my favorite ending of any movie I've ever seen.  What I mean by this is when Marty is in 1955 and finds out that the 'Doc' is still alive in the 1855 and realizes that he knows exactly where the 1955 Doc is, he goes to ask for his help.  The actual scene in particular that I'm talking about is when Doc sends Marty into the future due to the lightning storm and then Marty comes running down the street and says that he needs his help again. I just LOVE that scene, I think it's such a cool scene and leaves you dying to see Part III.If you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favor and go see it, and if you haven't seen the first in the series, then see that first.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",10,1,2,25 February 2002
Carrie," Not too shabby.
","I have to be honest, I was a little skeptical about liking this movie 'cause I'm really not a very big fan of horror movies.  They're ok, but they usually don't interest me.  I figured I ought to see 'Carrie' anyway, 'cause it's a classic horror movie, and it's directed by Brian De Palma.  I've really grown to like Brian De Palma as a director, 'Mission: Impossible' is one of my all-time favorite movies, and despite pretty bad reviews, I liked 'Mission To Mars' a lot.  I also saw 'Scarface' and 'Snake Eyes', and they were pretty good as well.  Anyhow, back to 'Carrie'.  As I watched the movie, I didn't feel like I was watching a horror movie.  Even after seeing it, I have a hard time calling it a horror movie.  I'm not really sure what I'd call it, but it doesn't seem to be much of a horror movie (although, I can't argue that it DOES have elements of horror in it).I thought the film was very well acted (minus a few scenes that I think could have been done better), and the story was actually pretty good.  The movie really seemed to flow quite well, I wasn't bored at all during the movie, and was interested in all the characters.  All-in-all, I thought it was a very good movie, and I hope that you agree.  Keep in mind though, that this movie was made in 1976, so it's not the same kind of movie as you see in theaters today.That's about all I have to say about the movie, thanks for reading.-Chris",8,2,3,19 February 2002
Shrek," Excellent Film, All Around Great!!!
","I loved everything about this film!  The animation alone is worth watching! I read a few other reviews on this site and a few of them said that they weren't impressed with the animation?  Are you serious?  What is wrong with you?  This animation is absolutely mind-boggling!  I think people that say they aren't impressed with the animation are people that have NO idea how much time, effort and work it takes to create just a single frame of this film (although, I'm no expert either, but I can at least imagine how hard it is).  Anyhow, don't listen to these people, the animation is excellent!!!The voice-acting is great on all accounts.  Mike Myers does a great Shrek, Cameron Diaz plays the perfect Princess Fiona, John Lithgow is awesome as Prince Farquaad, and Eddie Murphy completely steals the show as Donkey.  It really pains me to read other reviews and read that they didn't think the film was funny?  I don't know what to say to these people, I thought the film was hilarious!!!  Just different tastes I guess.I think this in one of the few films these days that can be enjoyed both by younger kids and adults, there's a lot of good stuff to this film.  I thought this film was excellent and can't wait for a sequel (hope it's good though).  I hope you enjoy the film when you see it, and you will!  Thanks for reading,-Chris",10,1,2,5 October 2002
The Silence of the Lambs," A great film, worth watching.
","Now don't get me wrong, I liked the movie a great deal, but I really can't understand why this movie has such a high rating and is so high on the IMDB top 250.  I guess I just can't seem to place what this film has that other films of the same nature don't have.  But, like I said, don't get me wrong, I thought this was an excellent film.Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins were fantastic in their respect roles and really had some great chemistry between their characters.  The supporting cast members, Anthony Heald, Scott Glenn, Ted Levine, and Frankie Faison were very good as well.  Also, the directing of Jonathan Demme was excellent.I thought the story was quite interesting and very well done.  The film is rarely boring and keeps a good pace throughout the film.  But keep in mind that this film is rather graphic in certain scenes.  There is an R rating for a reason.I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that enjoys a good crime-triller or liked the previous Thomas Harris adaptation, 'Manhunter'. Seeing 'Manhunter' is by no means a prerequisite to this film, but it may be a good idea to see it first and/or the recently released 'Red Dragon' (a re-make of 'Manhunter').  If you do get around to seeing this film, I hope you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",8,0,0,16 November 2002
Bruce Almighty," Jim Carrey and Tom Shadyac can't go wrong!
","Jim Carrey has got to be one of my favorite actors, I have yet to see him in a role that I didn't like.  He's nothing less than hilarious and I don't care what anyone says, he's a fantastic actor.  On top of that, Tom Shadyac is a superb director, making his third film with Jim Carrey (the previous two being: 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective' and 'Liar Liar').  The instant I heard they were working together again, I knew I'd love the movie.  So opening day rolled around and I wasted no time in getting myself to the movie theater to enjoy the film.  And of course, I was not let down, I laughed myself silly and had an all around great time.The story is beyond far-fetched, but it's all in good fun and actually has a good 'moral to the story' as they say.  The film is mainly about doing what it right and being happy with yourself.I'll admit though this is the first movie where I thought Jim Carrey was a little too nutty at times.  Like the whole tantrum on the bed when Jennifer Aniston is telling him to get out of bed, and a few other cases.  But the scenes where I was laughing so hard that the tears started flowing more than made up for those few 'too nutty' scenes.On top of the great story and the hilarious comedy, there is also a fair amount of special effects in the film, which are nothing less than great and work very well with the story.  And of course, there is the lovely Jennifer Aniston, need I say more?  She's looked better, but she did a fine job in the role and I enjoyed watching her performance.  Morgan Freeman was another fine addition to the cast, doing a very nice job with his role.What it boils down to is this.  If you liked 'Ace Ventura' or 'Liar Liar', then you definitely ought to check this movie out.  If you like Jim Carrey in general, see this movie!  If you aren't a fan of Jim Carrey, I'm not sure what to tell you, I guess I'd say see it anyway...you never know, you might like it.  Thanks for reading.-LebowskiT1000",10,0,3,18 July 2003
Signs," M. Night Shyamalan does it again!
","Ok, first of all, you can't expect a big-budget, over-the-top, special effects bonanza!  Yes, the movie involves some science fiction in it, but it's not really a true sci-fi film.  Next, you have to consider that M. Night Syamalan also wrote and directed 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable', so you know that this film is going to have the same sort of feel to it.The story in this film is very interesting and really quite creepy.  M. Night is a really great director!  The story moves along quite well and leave you hanging on every word and every scene.  M. Night also seems to be really good at the comedy aspect as well.The actors in this film do a great job.  Mel Gibson is great as always and Joaquin Phoenix just gets better and better as an actor.  Rory Culkin (another Culkin brother) does a really good job as well.  ...And I mustn't forget Abigail Breslin.  What a cute little girl!  She has numerous cute scenes throughout the film, and she's a REALLY good little actress.  I'll definitely be keeping my eyes open for her future work.I would hope that if you liked 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable' then you will like this film.  But I can't stress enough how much you need to not think of this movie as a sci-fi movie.  It's much more of a thriller / thought-provoking movie, rather than sci-fi.  Anyhow, just don't get your hopes up.  I truly hope that you enjoy the film.  Thanks for reading,-ChrisP.S. Can't wait for M. Night's next work!!!",10,0,2,3 August 2002
X2: X-Men United," One of the best sequels to date!
","The X-Men has always been my favorite comic book, without a doubt. Spider-man is probably in second place, but The X-Men take the cake.  Ever since I heard a sequel was going into the works and Bryan Singer was still on board as director, I had faith that he would do the sequel justice...of course I couldn't help but have that looming fear that something would go wrong.  In the end, the film was released and of course, I wasted no time in getting to the theater to see it on opening day.After seeing the film, I can definitely say it's been a long time since I've come out of a movie theater as happy as I did for this film.  The story was absolutely brilliant and was told in the perfect manner to keep you interested.  ...And of course, there are plenty of new characters and action to keep the audience in awe as well.Nightcrawler was a truly brilliant character to bring into the sequel of the film.  Nightcrawler (Kurt Wagner) has always been one of favorite X-Men characters, perhaps even more than Wolverine...but that's up for debate. Teleportation has GOT to be one of the coolest and most interesting ideas for a mutant ability!  I was incredibly stoked to see him brought to life on the big screen, Bryan Singer and Alan Cumming did a FANTASTIC job!  Next to Wolverine, Colossus has also got to be one of my favorite characters.  I can't even begin to express how happy I was to see him in the film...although not NEARLY enough was done with him when there was so much potential for his abilities in the film.  Oh well, there's always X-Men 3 right?  The other two new characters, Pyro (John Allerdyce) and Lady Deathstrike (Yuriko Oyama) were very well done as well, although not much of their character histories were explained...which is ok, there is only so much time in a film.  The rest of the characters already had a firm basis from the previous film and were all executed extremely well in this sequel, my hat is off to Mr. Bryan Singer, 'Keep up the good work!'The entire cast was absolutely perfect for the film.  Ian McKellan, Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Brian Cox, Alan Cumming, Bruce Davison, Anna Paquin, Kelly Hu, Aaron Stanford, Shawn Ashmore, and Daniel Cudmore all did incredible jobs with their roles and should be proud of their work, truly fantastic.The story in this sequel is great.  I love the idea of the good and the bad having an equal threat and being forced to work together in order to save them all.  The chemistry and the relationship between Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto) and Professor Charles Xavier is so bizarre and interesting...and very thought provoking.  There are so many interesting and well done relationships between characters in the film: Logan (Wolverine) - Scott Summers (Cyclops), Rogue - Bobby Drake (Iceman), Jean Grey - Scott Summers (Cyclops) and Jean Grey - Logan (Wolverine) to name a few.  I love just watching them all interact with each other.What it all boils down to is this, if you liked the first film, then you should definitely like this film.  I'm not sure I could say I liked X2 better than the original, but I'd definitely feel comfortable saying it was just as good...and better in certain aspects (but not as a whole).I would definitely recommend seeing this film in the theater or at least rent it when it's released, it's well worth your time.  This film isn't all about super-heroes, action and fantasy, there is a lot more to it than just that and I hope you can see and appreciate that.  I do hope that you enjoy the film as much as I do and thank you for reading my review, be sure to read my review for the first 'X-Men'.-ChrisP.S.  They better start crackin' on a X3 right away!Also..here's some interesting trivia for ya.  In the scene where Mystique is finding out where Magneto is being held she is scrolling through a bunch of names, the name above Lensherr, Erik (Magneto) is LeBeau, Remy...aka 'Gambit'...nice little touch there, I didn't get a look at the other names there, but there might be more allusions there.  Another cool thing is in the scene where the security guard is in the bar, there is a TV on in the background with a guy named Hank McCoy talking...Hank McCoy later becomes known as 'Beast'.  Pretty cool huh...",10,36,52,3 May 2003
Final Destination," It was...ok.
","I thought the movie started off great and declined as the movie went on. They really had a good idea going, but messed it up if you ask me.  I wasn't too fond of most of the cheesy deaths  (typical lame horror movie deaths). There were a lot of things that I thought would be developed, but they weren't.  'Final Destination' definitely had it's share of plot holes.  How does this 'cheat death' premise ever end?  I wasn't all too fond of the ending either.  Over all, I give it a 7 of 10.  Wait till video (unless you like these kind of movies).-Cortex",7,1,2,18 March 2000
A Night at the Roxbury," Good Fun
","I was quite a bit skeptical of this film being very funny when I first saw the previews.  The skit is funny on SNL in 3 minute increments, but an hour and half of it could be pretty bad.  So, I had pretty low expectations going into this film.  After seeing it, I have to say that I thought it was great and MUCH funnier than I thought it would be.Chris Kattan and Will Ferrell are a spectacular duo!  The both did a great job with their roles.  Dan Hedaya and Chazz Palminteri were nice additions to the cast, they both did a good job.  I have to say that Elisa Donovan, Gigi Rice, Meredith Scott Lynn and Jennifer Coolidge looked spectacular throughout the film, VERY beautiful women!  Lochlyn Munro (as Craig) was great too, I've only seen him in a few movies, but he really seems to be a great actor.  I was very happy to see Colin Quinn in the film.  This guy is great!  It was also cool to see Michael Clarke Duncan in the film, even though he had a very small part in the film.  I don't know what it is, but there is something about Molly Shannon that really bugs me.  Sometimes, she can be really funny, but other times I just can't stand her.  Maybe it's because she always acts the same, in all her films, I don't know.All in all, I thought the film was hilarious and was much better than I anticipated.  There are a number of scenes that make me laugh just thinking about them.  If you like the SNL skit at all, then you should probably see this film.  I really hope that you enjoy the film.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",8,4,5,2 August 2002
The Truman Show," Jim Carrey does another great film!
","It makes me feel so good to see that this film is in IMDB's top 250 films! This film completely deserves it!  Jim Carrey is one of the best actors of this generation and I hope he continues to make excellent films like this one.  Usually, I'm not one to like films with a 'deeper meaning', but I really like this film, because it gives you so much to think about and makes for an interesting story.  At first I thought this film was absolutely improbable, but after watching for my 3rd or 4th time, I don't think it's all that absurd (extremely unlikely, but not completely impossible).Director Peter Weir did a fantastic job with this film and this is probably one of his best films.  The cast was excellent throughout the film.  Ed Harris was just as great as always.  Laura Linney was superb as Meryl. Also, I think Natascha McElhone and Noah Emmerich deserve some special notice for their work.  The rest of the supporting cast was good as well, Paul Giamatti, Harry Shearer, Philip Baker Hall and everyone else.If you like Jim Carrey, then you really ought to see this film.  Be aware that this film is more of a dramatic comedy, as opposed to his complete zany comedy films made prior to this one.  I really hope that you do give this film a chance, and I hope even more that you enjoy it as much as I do. Thanks for reading,-Chris",9,0,1,30 October 2002
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Totally Excellent!
","'Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure' is most definitely just that!  This is just an all around FUN movie!  The plot is far from anything serious, but deep down there are some good morals and such things to take from this film. 'Be Excellent To Each Other'  That is some good advice, is it not?The comedy in this film is just superb!  I've seen this movie more times than I can count with my fingers and every time it gets even better!  There are so many lines in this film that you just can't help but repeat, because they're just so funny and well done!  There are a number of times that I find myself just cracking up at the scene, situation, or what have you.  If you don't laugh at least a little during the course of this film, then I think you've got some problems.The acting is great.  Everybody knocks Keanu Reeves for his acting, but I think he's great.  And he does a great job in this film.  Alex Winter also plays a great part.  The rest of the cast is great too.Not only is the comedy and the acting great, but there are some REALLY good science fiction sort of idea's in this film.  The scene where Bill and Ted meet the future Bill and Ted is just amazingly well done, and such a cool idea.  I love that you first see the scene from the perspective of one set of Bill and Ted's, and then later the Bill and Ted that the story follows becomes the other set of Bill and Ted's.  Did that make sense?  Well, anyway, see the movie and you'll know what I'm talking about.  There were a few other really good scenes and ideas throughout the film.All in all, I would definitely recommend seeing this film, it's not a complex story by any means, and just a whole lot of fun.  Try not to take the film too seriously and you'll hopefully enjoy it.  I truly hope that you enjoy this film.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",8,42,58,27 August 2002
The Matrix," The Best
","What can I say about 'The Matrix'?  Well, I think I'll have to start with...'This is one of...if not the best movie I've ever seen.  The movie is excellent from start to finish, I was never once bored, and one of the best story lines I've ever encountered.  If you haven't seen this movie, you really ought to.  The special effects are astounding and the acting is quite good.  I give it a 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,25 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," One of the best!
","Well, there isn't much I can say about 'Star Wars' that you haven't already heard, so I'm going to keep this short.  This is most definitely one of my favorite movies of all time.  I don't know what it is about this movie, maybe it's the incredible special effects, the great characters, the great story, the originality, the fact that I grew up watching this movie repeatedly...I don't know...but it's just an all-around great movie.

Hart's War," Better than expected
","From the trailers of the film I was only slightly interested in the film.  I finally got around to seeing the film and thought it was a lot better than the trailers made it out to be.  I'm very sorry that this film didn't do better in the box office, I think the competition was just too much to overcome...after all, I didn't see it in the theaters.There are a few problems I have with the film and likeliness of such a thing happening, but this IS a movie we're talking about, so I can deal with it. The story has a lot of cool aspects to it though, like another reviewer mentioned, it's got racial issues, courtroom drama, a prison camp setting, and war overtones.  A lot of good stuff all thrown together.I thought the acting was really good on all accounts, Bruce Willis pulls off a nice performance as usual.  Colin Farrell does a great job, he's really becoming quite a good actor.  Terrence Howard was another great addition to the cast and Cole Hauser also deserves a some credit.Well, if you're a fan of Bruce Willis or if you kind of like what you've seen in the trailers, then you should definitely check this film out.  I really hope that you enjoy the film as much as I did.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",8,2,3,13 August 2002
Cube," Could Have Been Great!
","'Cube' had one of the greatest ideas for a movie I've ever seen.  Right up there with 'The Matrix'.  But it was ruined!Don't read this if you haven't seen it.I loved the idea of people being trapped in this maze and not knowing why or how, superb idea.  Of course I don't know how one would react in such a situation, but why would this cop, a man who does good, go crazy and start killing and beating people for no apparent reason?  Kind of stupid if you ask me.  Also...as one of the other comments mentioned...how would this so-called cop get to the end of the maze on his own?  There is no way he could get anywhere without the girl genius or the autistic guy.  ...Ok, so let's assume that he does get to the end of the maze...why didn't Leavin and Worth hear the door opening when the 'cop' came into the room?This movie went from a great sci-fi, mind-job movie to a retarded horror pointless story.Here's a question for the Director/Writer...Why on earth did you have these characters go through hell just to die at the brink of escaping?  What a let down!!!That's my two cents.  Thanks.",7,10,16,20 February 2000
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Better Than Episode IV - A New Hope
","It really isn't often that you see a sequel that you like more than the original, but I feel pretty comfortable saying that I liked 'Empire Strikes Back' more than 'A New Hope'.I absolutely love the new worlds that are shown to us; Hoth, Degobah and Bespin.  The story is great, the characters are incredible, the special effects are phenomenal...everything about this movie is awesome!  There are so many great aliens, beasts and characters in this film, just to name a few: The Hoth Wampa, Taun-Taun's, Boba Fett, Bossk, Yoda, Lando Calrissian, and many many more.There are so many great scenes in this film as well as great costumes.  I love the Hoth Stormtroopers, and the entire section that takes place on Hoth is superb!  One scene that I've always liked is the scene near the end where Chewbacca, Leia, Han and Lando walk into the room and see Vader standing at the end of table and Chewbacca roars.  I don't know why, but I LOVE that scene so much!  Then there's the whole Han being frozen in Carbonite deal, just great!  The ending of this film is also great because it totally leaves you in a state of suspense.Anyhow if you haven't figured out what I'm trying to say, I'm trying to say it's in your best interest to see this movie, but you should/must see 'A New Hope' first.

A Walk to Remember," Teen Chick-Flick. An Ok Movie.
","Don't get me wrong I have nothing against chick-flicks, I love chick-flicks and this film is a good one.  I wouldn't say this film was anything great or spectacular, but it was enjoyable.  The only difference between this movie and other typical teen chick-flicks is that this one has a slightly harsher ending.  Overall, it was still a good movie.The actors all did a pretty good job.  Mandy Moore did a find job for her role and Shane West was better than I expected.  Peter Coyote was good in his role too.  I was very pleased to see Daryl Hannah in a film, she seems to have left the mainstream type of films.  The rest of the cast was fine too.If you're into teen love movies, then this is the film for you.  I hope you enjoy the film.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",8,0,0,9 August 2002
Windtalkers," Good job John Woo!!!
","I have to say that when I first heard that John Woo was making a war epic, I was a little unsure of how good it would be.  John Woo is great with action movies ('Broken Arrow', 'Face/Off', 'Mission: Impossible 2', but a war movie?  I have to admit though that this was one of the better war movies I've ever seen.  I'm not a huge war film fan, I mean I like watching them and all, but I don't get all excited about them when they are first released.I thought all the cast members did a fantastic job with their roles. Nicolas Cage is just great as always and Christian Slater pulls of a really good performance.  I was also really impressed with Adam Beach and Roger Willie.  Other notable actors are Peter Storemare, Noah Emmerich, Mark Ruffalo, Frances O'Connor and Jason Isaacs.The story is very interesting and really well done.  It was actually a bit of a learning experience for me.  I had no idea that they used a code based on the Navajo language in World War II.  Very cool stuff.I would think (and hope) that anyone that likes war films would like this film.  But keep in mind that this is a war film and it is most definitely a graphic film.  Well, I really hope that you enjoy the film and thanks for reading,-Chris",9,1,3,1 August 2002
Contact," A science fiction film executed perfectly!
","When I first saw this film I was a slight bit disappointed because I wanted to see come cool creature effects and some aliens of sorts.  I guess I was expecting a different type of movie.  Since then I've watched this film a number of times, and I have to say that this is probably one of the best sci-fi movies ever to hit the big screen!The story is absolutely fantastic, the casting is perfect, the direction is top-notch, the acting is flawless, the special effects are jaw-dropping...this is an awesome film!I thought the story in this film is absolutely fantastic!  I love the idea of faith and science colliding and the disputes it creates.  At times it is very infuriating, but interesting nonetheless.  All of the characters were played perfectly, but there are a few that just make you want to scream at them for being so stubborn or outright moronic.All of the cast member deserve great praise for their work.  Jodie Foster, Matthew McConaughey, David Morse, James Woods, William Fichtner, Jena Malone, Tom Skerritt, Angela Bassett, Rob Lowe, Jake Busey, John Hurt, and everyone else that was involved in the film.  The director, Robert Zemeckis, is a true genius of his craft.  The way he films his movies and the way his stories are told are just spectacular.  Robert is definitely one of my favorite directors of all time!  He is truly incapable of making a bad film.If you haven't seen this film, then I strongly recommend you see it.

Back to the Future," One of the Best of ALL time!
","There isn't enough good things I can say about this film.  Robert Zemeckis is definitely one of the best directors out there.  The film has a great story line from start to finish and does a great job of keeping you interested in the characters.Usually movies that deal with time travel don't do a very good job of keeping it feasible (cause time travel is such a bizarre subject), but this movie has a quite feasible story (given that time travel is possible).The special effects are also great, even for today's standards, they're very good!  Well, I guess what I'm getting at is that if you haven't seen this movie yet then you've missed out on greatness.  Please go see this movie! Thank you,-Chris",10,2,3,23 February 2002
Jurassic Park," One of the Best of ALL time!
","This film is, without a doubt, one my all time favorite movies of all time! It is also definitely in my top 10 favorite movies.  This movie is one of the best stories ever written, if you ask me.  Michael Crichton is a stud and a half!  I love the idea of dinosaurs being re-created from DNA and then getting loose on an island, just BRILLIANT!  Then you throw Steven Spielberg into the mix and you have sure success.There is virtually nothing bad I can say about this movie.  Although there are a few things are awesome at first but then you think about it and you think yourself 'Wait a second'...case and point...at the end when the T-Rex magically appears behind Dr. Grant and the group and nobody noticed.  And how on earth could that beast have gotten inside the building?  So, there are a few scenes like that, but nothing that I can't deal with.Overall, I could watch this movie a hundred times and NEVER get sick of it. The special effects alone are worth seeing this film.  It's just absolutely incredible how realistic the computer effects look.  The acting is very good as well.  I loved Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Adriana Richards, Joseph Mazello, Wayne Knight, Samuel L. Jackson, and everybody else.  The cast was just EXCELLENT in this film.If you haven't seen this film yet, then I'm confused what you're doing reading this review.  GO SEE THE MOVIE!!!  Even if you hate it (let's just pray that doesn't happen), you still ought to see it...because you're probably the one person that hasn't seen it yet.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",10,2,4,24 March 2002
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Coen Brothers do it again!!!
","I've seen just about all of the Coen brothers' films now, and I have to say this is one of their better films.  I wouldn't dare say it's better than 'The Big Lebowski', but it was very good in it's own right.I thought the story was very interesting and hilarious at times.  I loved all the characters, especially Tim Blake Nelson (Delmar) and John Turturro's (Pete).There really isn't anything bad I can say about this movie, but this movie isn't for everyone.  It might be safe to say that if you liked the other Coen brothers' films, then you'll hopefully like this one too.  And if you liked what you saw in the trailer, I think you'll like the film, but don't hold me to it.Anyhow, I hope that you like(d) the film as much as I do.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",9,1,1,15 February 2002
