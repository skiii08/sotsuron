Your Name.," Beautiful
","Ok, this is my first review of a movie, so maybe I'll be brief.The story is very well written, it just somehow feel like it does make sense. Kudos to the writer!The art is very well made, I don't find any awkwardness in every character's movement and interaction, it just feel so natural. Well, maybe that's just the standard quality for a good Japanese anime.The scenery is very beautiful, it somehow catch the very much of Japan in its depiction of Tokyo and the rural image of small town in Japan. I'm not Japanese myself, but I've been to Japan quite some times, and it feels very nostalgic to watch the scenery in this movie.The soundtrack is very nice, the music is very heartwarming and just click very well with the love story in the movie.Overall, I highly recommend this movie not just for anime lovers, but also for everyone.",9,3,4,14 April 2018
Avengers: Endgame," What a journey
","What a remarkable journey it is for Marvel Cinematic Universe. I don't think anything can accomplish this kind of achievement in another franchise universe. This is indeed one of a kind.To everyone contributing in the making of this universe, producers, story writers, directors, actors, CGI makers, and everyone involved, from the bottom of my heart, I say thank you very much for the experience, the sensation, the excitement, the wonders you guys brought to the movies..",9,4,12,24 April 2019
