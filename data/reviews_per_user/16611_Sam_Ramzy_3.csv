The Avengers," when the words epic and awesome can't describe what u feel...
","If you ask me, making a superhero movie easy , why??? well, the whole formula of a super hero facing a mad man who wants to take over the world then hero saves earth, with some fancy effects, and you have a movie, BUT it is not an easy task to impress people or make them to take the movie seriously, in my opinion the two main films that succeeded in making a revolution in the superhero category movies are the new dark knight franchise, which took things 2 the next level, with their deep messages and this movie Avengers. Avengers is one of these movies that will leave an impact for a long time, the cast is perfect, a strong script and kick ass direction. - The story, is really interesting, it was fresh, it wasn't boring at all, not just another hey we saved the world yay nop it made me feel like i was fighting with them YES WE SAVED THE WORLD, i don't know how to describe it, all i can say is that the script was really good and it will make you excited, I love aliens so i was excited,,, - The cast is PERFECT, these guys were like peanut butter and jam \m/ which is one of the main reasons that the film succeeded, with out the perfect cast this movie would be average, Tom Hiddleston is a genius i love his role he was perfect, he played his role well, as for Robert Downey, Jr. this guy is damn awesome, every time the movie gets really serious he comes in and lighten up the mood \m/, the rest of the cast were really awesome, kudos 2 all of them :). - The direction was really good, the effects were awesome and not corny, perfect job. - this movie proves that by the right cast, direction and script you could make a respectful not just another superhero movie, this movie was a dream movie 4 most of us and damn i'm lucky enough 2 be alive 2 c it, i was really excited and when i came out of the cinema i got more excited, awesome movie, if you didn't c it then GO,,,,",10,5,11,11 May 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," WOW, dark and amazing,,,
","I'm not a huge fan of the harry potter's movies, i love the books more than the movies, but I have to admit hell yeah I loved this movie. Nowadays i'm in Egypt_thanx 2 my dad_ I decided to go to the cinema, from the first scene of the movie i was like glued to my seat, I loved the dark atmosphere of the movie, it gave another taste to the movie, another thing is the battle scenes i was blown off how amazing are they, the only drawback is the 3D thing, you know these kinds of movies needs you to be concentrated to the details and you must live the dark atmosphere that this film provides, but the 3D effects weren't bad but I'd prefer if the released it in 2D but whatever money talks in these situations. So this weekend get your mates, family or whatever go to the cinema, and watch the damn movie, if you don't watch will then you'' loose a lot, i grantee that you'll enjoy your time, yup this franchise couldn't better than this.",10,1,4,14 July 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," I had fun but,,,,
","OK, i won't say any spoilers but the story it self is shallow and allow me to say its totally predictable, we all knew what will happen, in other words you'll give your brain a rest because there's no depth in the story at all. What was real amazing was the effects i mean wow :D its one of those few time that you can actually have fun in a 3D movie i was in the edge of my seat ,Michael Bay made an amazing job in directing this movie. Hell yeah i had a lot of fun and i had a gr8 time, but that's all the movie's goal is to have fun so it served its purpose, but don't expect to see something deep, because you won't find any.So if you just want to have fun, see flying robots and these kind of stuff then this film is for you.",6,1,4,7 July 2011
