Hereditary," A rare horror film.
","The large amount of background information reflects the indifference of the real society to the mental patients and the lonely elderly.Its selection has also increased the film's thickness.Many hidden information in the film is worth pondering.The selection of actors and their excellent acting skills add even more horror to the movie.In short, this film is one of the rare works of excellence this year.",7,1,2,6 October 2018
