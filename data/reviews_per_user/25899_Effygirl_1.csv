The Blair Witch Project," GREAT MOVIE
",This is a totally great movie. I can't see why anyone would dislike it. If they know the facts behind the documentary it is a totally scary movie and totally one that makes you sit up and watch. I would love to know more about it but that is one thing that makes it so good. You really have to decide for your self if it is real or not. Did 2 kids go out looking for info one this place and never return?? By all reports that is exactly what happened. Therefore what happened to them???? One that you have to decide for yourself. I saw it tonight at the drive-in. Tomorrow going to the cinema to see it again. I give it a 10/10 rating.,10,1,2,11 September 1999
