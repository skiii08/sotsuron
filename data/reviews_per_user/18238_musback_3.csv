The Avengers," Special effects for special people.
","Where to start. Me and my wife watched this movie yesterday, to forget about the drama called 'battleship' (don't get me started.) But it's hard to choose the most retarded movie between the two. This one had some okay jokes in it, but like many people said: you don't feel any threat, you don't feel any story, you just see special effects and 'UHMERICA F* YAA' 2hrs straight. The effects were good, and the Hulk smashed like he never smashed before, but every movie starts sucking as soon as you realize nobody of the good guys can actually die. (Lord Of the rings anyone?) and when legions of 10x more bad-ass alien monsters are killed throwing a chair at them or blind-aimed headshotting them with a bow on a spaceship going 300mph, you know you're just wasting your time. Anybody with the very least amount of self-respect, stay away from this movie, How this garbage achieved to get 8.6 on IMDb is more entertaining for me than watching that movie. Says a lot about IMDb and what it has become compared to what it used to be.",2,14,28,27 August 2012
Gravity," Very disappointed
","I rarely write reviews, but just because the 'critics' in Belgium (and worldwide) were unanimously (ridiculously) enthusiastic I just feel the moral obligation of putting people back on their feet. They made it feel like the movie of the century, it felt like the 'Jurassic Park' of space movies... And as a die-hard sci-fi lover I really wanted to love this film, but sadly enough it now feels as cheap marketing gibberish. The graphics and audio are very good. Obviously. But just like Transformers: amazing cgi can't make up for a bàd movie. The story and whole movie actually failed me on every possible level. Without going into some pretty obvious mistakes, the story simply doesn't connect, it doesn't grow on me. It feels like just a chain of events with very simple/flat dialogs and no real build-up or climaxes. It's short, it's simple. Not only that, but it's actually a very sad overstatement to say 'this one of the most realistic space movies out there' as I'm constantly trying NOT to point out some big flaws to my wife so she would not completely be disappointed. That said, I kind of like Bullock in most of her movies. A nice unpretentious 'simple girl' can only score in my opinion, but my wife and I were constantly annoyed with her clumsiness, lack of 'hurry' (even while breathing co²), lack of courage, lack of education as an astronaut and so forth... But I guess that's a bad character/script in stead of a bad actress. She felt to me like what Jaden Smith does to most of his recent movies (which Is why i decided never to waste my time on him again). Anything but award-winning if you ask me :-/ But who am I. Watch the movie because society forces you, I don't care, but this is the last time I rely on IMDb ratings and 'real' Movie critics. Now it has 8.8, but in a year it will be down to 7.5, mark my words.",1,4,8,10 January 2014
Pan's Labyrinth," A young girl escapes a harsh world by entering a world of fantasy.
","it was fan-tas-tic! I truly loved the magical touch in this movie. The movie is actually a combination of 2 very strong stories; a fantasy journey and a rather brutal Spanish war. Both stories blend perfectly! The acting is very good, very natural and the Spanish language makes the fantastic characters sound like they speak enchanted dead languages (if you don't speak Spanish of course :o) It differentiates itself from other movies because of this because there are no cheesy 'i love you'-lines or tough American style WarHeroism-language.The magic isn't childish at all, it's more of a mature nature, very dark and can be very scary/spooky (like in Brothers Grimm). Believe me, Watch this movie, you WILL NOT REGRET IT. either if you like fantasy or a strong war-story, just let your eyes feast on this masterpiece.one of my all-time favorites.",10,15,30,8 December 2006
