The Perks of Being a Wallflower," being in time
","Steven Chbosky'directorial debut , same author of the novel ' The perks of being a wallflower' is focused on the difficult time of Charlie's growing up , an insecure boy from a difficult past. Logan Lerman's anticharismatich talent passes trough his eyes and body and bloom es when he decides to dance during a party. There is 'High Fidelity' in Chbosky's images , but not the generational and iconic images of Jhon Hughes'movies ,nothing of similar to ' The breakfast club' to explain us ,but a kind of Bildungsroman story that eyes to ' Dead poets society' and to ' An education'. On this wall we can hang ' The perks of being a wallflower' , that of the movie to collect whom growing and getting older. But something is missed , to be unforgiven , there is not a semiotic/ semantic repartition,instantaneousness of time that author is living in isn't admit , characters aren't well done , like they were daguerreotypes of a paint who pretends to be a photograph. There's not a minimal perception. The adaptation starts quite good but it's always more lighted and shaded to the last minutes of the movie. It's not gold all that glitters but even the bigotry makes his part.",8,0,1,27 June 2013
