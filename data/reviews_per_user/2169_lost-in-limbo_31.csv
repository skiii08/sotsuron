10 Cloverfield Lane," Too bad about the ending.
","An unstable John Goodman or hostile aliens? Let me think about it... again. Locked in a underground bunker with an unstable John Goodman or on the surface trying to keep one step ahead of hostile aliens? Talk about being caught between a rock and a hard place. After much consideration you might take the chance with the latter threat, after you realise just how intense a game of charades can be.'10 CLOVERFIELD LANE' is a confined and agonising character driven thriller that cleverly feeds off the uncertainty of the situation and the interplay of its characters. Working in its favour is how they filmed it, like you're actually riding it out in the bunker alongside those inside. Feeling every sense of emotions streaming from the trio. Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr really do hold you there with very good performances. Both their characters are adapt and affably brought across. But you just can't go passed the powerhouse acting of John Goodman. It's a tailored performance of pure manipulation and embodying unease. As for the last 10 minutes, it was serviceable but disappointing compared to the impressive build-up that had gone before it.",7,0,0,30 June 2020
Resident Evil: Afterlife," 'Hey boys, is that any way to treat a lady?'
","After surprisingly enjoying the last instalment; 'Extinction' which was directed by Russell Mulcahy. Filmmaker Paul W. Anderson would find his way back to the director's chair, not since helming the original film. He did however write the screenplay for all four. Now 'Afterlife' continues on from 'Extinction', but was somewhat a comedown and fairly underwhelming for me to put it down as being my least favourite of the lot so far. Done in 3D for its theatrical release, couldn't hide the fact it drew upon tired mechanisms. The special effects felt like it was taken out of the matrix, so therefore the action felt uninspired and sterile. Too bad because while it seems lazy the opening remains captivating in its execution of its searing action set-pieces and plot ties (the Alice clones being used to wipe out the Tokyo based Umbrella corporation facility). But after that promising start it loses its way by becoming bogged down, muddled and uninteresting in the direction it goes. This is when Alice discovers an old friend, where during a plane ride they end with a ragtag of survivors held up in a Los Angles prison and there she learns the truth about the safe haven of Arcadia. Anderson tries up the ante with showy techniques, by bombarding us with kinetic editing, slow motion activity, pounding heavy music and flashy computer effects in a repetitive parade of bloody carnage and smoking firepower. This focus seems like an attempt to cover up its thin narrative, stale script and minor characters, because it's all hot air in the way it goes about building-up plot progression. Really all it does it takes bit and pieces from the other entries and weakly puts it together in something of a long-running comic serial. The desert makes way for urban infrastructure. The prison setting makes it rather compact and drab, so are the characters that are included. Really it's about Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter. Jovovich might not be a dominant as Alice like previous entries, but she still strongly carries it along. Larter was better than expected. The scene with them together battling the Axeman in the prison shower block is probably the only highlight in the latter half. Shawn Roberts milks it with aplomb as an Umbrella Corporation associate. Also in the cast are Kim Coates, Wentworth Millar, Boris Kodjoe and Sienna Guillory as Jill Valentine makes a very brief appearance through the end credits. A forgettable fare, which is all dressed up but goes nowhere with it.'This is a big mistake'.",5,1,3,10 September 2011
Alien: Resurrection," 'Hey, Ripley. I heard you, like, ran into these things before?'
","I actually read the novel before I had ever seen the feature, and I really enjoyed it. As I remembered being on holidays with my family soon after it just opened at cinemas and grabbing a copy to fill in the time. The aspect I liked about it was that the fact you could read that of the thoughts of the aliens. Sure it wouldn't work on film (well it might --- however it would feel quite odd to tell the truth), but it was an interesting touch in the book. I seen it a couple times now and it remains just as adrenaline pumped and enjoyably over-the-top entertainment.Anyhow French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet and writer Josh Whedon (best known for penning 'Buffy: The Vampire Slayer' TV series and than later on the TV show and movie 'Firefly') would definitely change the tone of the franchise with this well-budgeted sequel 'Alien Resurrection' as its broodingly surreal visual edge and venomous tongue-in-cheek approach were the signature styles of its creators. Was it better for itÂ… well, yes and no. While for me it doesn't come close to the first two films, I believe it to be an improvement over David Fincher's 'Alien 3'. Which I don't believe to be as bad as many make it out to be, but still a disappointing experience (although the producer's cut fixes up some problems evident in the theatrical release).Whedon's story is a perfect blend of sci-fi/ horror / action that starts off with an interesting vision, before transcending into the same old formula. Nonetheless director Jeunet's clinical, but streamlined handling constructs some twisted images (like that of the newborn alien) and exciting passages outside the graphic jolts, liked the sequences staged underwater and involving some ladder climbing. The atmosphere is dark and shadowy with vast, open long wide photography and an expansively simmering score.Special effects remain impressive as ever. Mixing with effective puppet work (how can you forget the second tongue and constant drooling!) and decent CGI work. The competent make-up FX stands up with moments of graphic carnage and new creation or two. The ensemble cast do decent job. Ron Pealman pretty much steals the show and Sigourney Weaver seems to be relishing her return. Winona Ryder is okay. Then there's solid support by Michael Wincott, J.E. Freeman, Dan Hedaya, Gary Dourdan and Brad Dourif.",7,3,5,26 December 2009
Batman Returns," Masking a good time.
","As a kid I grew up with the chintzy 60's TV series (and no I'm not that old POW!). However when director Tim Burton brought his novel vision to the silver screen, I simply took an immediate shine to it and never backed away from favoring his installments over the much hyped-latest additions ('Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight'), which I don't really care for. Even if they're going for a much more grounded approach and wanting to explore Bruce Wayne/Batman psyche further but in honesty I don't think there's all that much to tap in to. I wanted crazy fun with a dark streak and in my eyes that's what Burton brought across, and this is the reason why I can watch them over and over again. After wowing audiences with the 1989 'Batman', thanks to the gaudily Gothic art direction and Jack Nicholson take no-prisoners performance of the camped-up, but psychotic Joker. Burton would return 3 years later for the follow up and my favorite of the batman films so far; 'Batman Returns'. Camp, but well-done. In what would fair up to being even more expansive, louder, dreary, and nihilistic and having two villainous foes for the price of one. Enter the grotesque Penguin (with Danny DeVito magnificently going out on a limb) and the ravishing Catwoman (a steamy Michelle Pfeiffer who fills out the suit nicely) coming to spoil Gotham's party. Again Batman (an aptly brooding Michael Keaton is equally commendable and looks quite imposing in that bat suit look at the eyes) plays second fiddle to the bad guys, but I always preferred this sober interpretation of Batman that gave him an ominously gloomy mystique, but also a wearing psychological complexity that never felt the need to force feed. And his turn of Bruce Wayne was well served too. Burton's illustratively atmospheric direction opens with his sleek Gothic style engraving an carnival comic book world filtered in with a splendid range of characters and vivid costumes. The moody narrative (in what probably is a tad too long) is more so symbolic in its progression, rather show-piecing its spontaneously arresting and extravagant set-pieces and sharply etched art direction covered with shadowy tinges and grey/blue neon lighting of a wintry backdrop. The magnetically free-flowing camera-work takes flight and Danny Elfman's stately spacious score balances the playfulness along with gloomy touches with a very hypnotic pull. The rest of the performances might be overshadowed, but Christopher Walken digs in his teeth into a smarmily glassy role of a two-faced businessman Max Shreck. Pat Hingle is back, but gets very little to do as Commissioner James Gordon and Michael Gough is delightful as Alfred. In solid support are Michael Murphy, Andrew Bryniarski, Vincent Schiavelli, Doug Jones and Peter Rubens also makes a cameo appearance.",9,2,4,27 September 2009
The Others," Accommodating the afterlife.
","Set in England after WW2, Grace and her two children, Anne and Nicholas live in a rather isolated mansion waiting for their husband/father to return from the war, but I they haven't heard from him since leaving. To make matters even more worst their housekeepers have just got up and left without any notice and the kids suffer from an illness were sunlight could cause them to badly, blister up. But suddenly three mysterious servants show up to work there and that's when strange occurrences start happening with the kids claiming that they're not alone in the house, but the uneasy Grace doesn't want to hear about it, that's until she becomes aware of the strange forces at work.The sudden interest in subtle, supernatural horror flicks can be attributed a lot to M. Night Shyamalan's film; 'The Sixth Sense (1999)'. This is my second viewing of it and I might be going against the grain, but I say this film is more emotionally engaging with such penetrating atmosphere and flawless performances compared with M. Night's mixed bag. 'The Others' is an intelligently stylish, sophisticated slow burner that plays on the little things to work up the increasing intensity that slowly strangles you with its grinding atmospheric air. Director Alejandro Amenabar manages to create a rich atmosphere from the shadowy grand exterior of the house to the blanket of mist that smothers the lush surroundings of the estate. But what impressed me most was the confident and sensitively in depth performances he got out of the small cast. Nicole Kidman raises the bar with an extraordinary performance as the rigidly, fearful mother. The two kids Alakina Mann and James Bentley are convincingly good. Then you got remarkable supporting roles from Fionnula Flanagan, Eric Sykes and Elaine Cassidy. Christopher Eccleston makes a small appearance too. The story sticks close to the traditional, Gothic haunted house tale with the usual set-up with dead silence making way for sudden noises, poorly lit rooms, things going bump, fake scares and so on. But what made these things such a breath of fresh air is how director Amenabar had total control of his vision with precise timing to milk out its bold, suggestive thrills, which will totally put you on the edge just like that of Kidman's brittle character. The atmosphere ventures into a dreamlike realm but still keeping a steady foot in reality. While, in the imposing Gothic mansion the darkness fills every space with it creaking with isolation and tightly knitted quarters. These striking visuals and set-pieces are gorgeously shot with such skill and a good eye for detail. A powerfully streamlined score is generally enchantingly and when it strives for creepy scares it does so in an exhaustingly tense tone. The elegant plot illustrates an very intriguing mystery tale that's psychologically demanding with secrets crossing your path and many cryptic hints to what may happen. The film's major revelation might not be a huge surprise for some, but I for one didn't think it was that easy to pick up on.A chillingly subtle, but astoundingly effective suspense drama that pushes you to the brink with assured direction and very first-rate performances.",8,2,4,10 April 2006
Resident Evil: Extinction," Hope is fading... Or is it?
","Never been much of a fan of the first two films (nor the video games), but this one I thought is somewhat an improvement in that it was entertaining and less showy. Thankyou. However I wouldn't make too much of it, when I still found it to be quite one-note with its plotting and covered with terribly conceived special effects. This one looks cheap, and it kinda shows in many aspects. What it concentrates is on its flashy style to storm up blistering action sequences and lets the expansive camera-work do its trick. The barren locations are well shot and the action is well handled without overplaying it. I wasn't so crazy about the erratic editing of the previous two 'Resident Evil' films, but this one wasn't so bad and more often suitably focused. Some edgy, gripping and scorching set pieces do standout and the glum tone holds tight, but Paul W. Anderson's choppy story (which seems like a mixture of the first two movies) doesn't skip away from the basic one-tune to have much of a dent. Minimal post-apocalyptic b-grade nonsense with a standard script. The characters are so paper-thin, that they're never really annoy or gain your interest. To make matters worse the climax is pretty much a whimper. The performances are nothing special, and everyone goes by in a forgettable fashion. Well nearly everyone. Milla Jovovich's hell-bent turn is compelling, and Oded Fehr has a likable presence. Ali Larter is simply going throw the motions, and Ashanti is wasted but that's no complaint here. Russell Mulcahy's glossy direction stays snappy, and controlled. He throws in his fair share of cheap thrills, and the bloody make-up f/x are soundly executed. Some visuals do remind you of Romero's vastly superior 'Day of the Dead (1985)'. The soundtrack doesn't lend much of an impact, and the same can be said about the music score. Filled with flaws, but it works as enjoyable brainless fluff that keeps a fast-pace.",6,1,2,24 October 2007
Silent Hill," Darkness will never forget the past.
","Not terrible, but quite a frustrating experience. Being less of a gamer and not knowing anything about the video games its based upon probably didn't help, however this a feature length film ( a strange one too) and not a interactive game. Visually I loved it (thanks to director Christophe Gans' appealingly slick and vast eye), but the story was hard to come to gripes as it doesn't go to much lengths to build upon its interesting set-up. It leads you on a nightmarish puzzler, and then tries to cram everything in towards the end. The usual explanation for the events. Due to some lulling passages, I found it hard to truly get in to with the saving grace being the very good central performance from Rahda Mitchell and the eerily disorienting atmospherics with the superbly presented, if exaggerated monster creations (make-up and CGI being used). These demons do like to hand out nasty, explicit punishment. The ideas were there, but the execution of it was cluttered and unfocused like one set-piece was thrown on top of another --- and in a way I found the side-story of the concerned father (admirably played by Sean Bean) trying to find his missing wife and daughter while also digging up the history of the tainted town Silent Hill to be a lot more engrossing then the leaden angle of the mother looking for her missing daughter while experiencing the town's many demons - unnatural and human. In all honesty the story is meant to be a teaser and what you call a mind^%#@ with random occurrences and an ending that's rather haunting in its suggestion through imagery (mainly the performances) and the use of an airy score (which during the intense moments can be bruising). Also the slaughterhouse climax in a church is a sight to see too.",5,0,1,26 March 2010
Taxi Driver," Excellent
","A lonely Vietnam veteran who has insomnia spends his nights as a taxi driver in the dirty streets of New York, where he encounters a young prostitute who he tries to help make a difference. This is a very good film and one of Martin Scorsese best (Goodfellas being my fave). An excellent portrayal from Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle the cabbie and good performances from Jodie Foster as the child prostitute Iris Steensman, Cybill Shepherd, Peter Boyle and Harvey Keitel as a pimp called Sport. You actually get drawn into the isolation and anger that Travis is feeling towards these lowlifes and because of that you really feel sympathy for him. Though after a while the loneliness and the city really starts to haunt Travis's mind, causing violent instincts and paranoia. This film is filled with such memorable lines e.g.Travis Bickle 'You talking to me? Well I'm the only one here.' and the many powerful scenes that stay in your head after it's finished. The hypnotic cinematography is a standout, as if your seeing the harsh & gritty New York streets and twisted people through the eyes of Travis when he is driving his cab. A great screenplay, a stunning score by Bernard Herrmann and a superb atmosphere created. This is a brutally compelling and bleak look at a decaying and corrupt society of the 70's. An unsettling gem of a film. 5/5",10,204,263,30 October 2004
Top Secret!," From the guys who brought us 'Airplane' and 'The Kentucky Fried Movie', comes
","Nick Rivers an American 50's Rock star is invited to perform at a festival in East Germany. Throughout his stay he falls for a charming young lady, Hillary, who's involved with the French Resistance because of her scientist father being captured by the Nazis. Nick then suddenly finds himself caught in this conflict and goes out of the way to help Hillary and the French Resistance free her father.Well, I simply adore this broad and terribly ridiculous skit-riddled spoof by the comedy team Jerry & David Zucker and Jim Abraham. Nothing is safe (especially stereotypes), where the 50's Rock n Roll era (Elvis flicks); Espionage films and Hollywood Movies (such as Blue Lagoon and Wizard of Oz) hit mocksville. But while rock 'n' rolling with the Nazis, it also manages to poke fun at itself along the way, because really it's just one big joke with the little ones feeding off it. The lively premise is simply unhinged with a wild range of rapid-fire gags (the under-water saloon brawl being my favourite) and crazy musical segments, which are loosely tied to the thin central story. It doesn't wallow on about things, as there's always one joke after another, which mostly comes off and if not, it's quickly forgotten. Plus you got little diverting actions going on in the background behind the main dig, which can raise smirk. Amongst the many droll wisecracks in the script, are some smart jibs.A very young looking Val Kilmer makes his big screen debut and passes with flying colours. His appealing persona is more then credible, as the rock heartthrob Nick Rivers (which clearly is a parody of Elvis Presley). Sharing the screen with him is the very lovely Lucy Gutteridge and a risible turn by Christopher Villiers. In enjoyably short roles are Michael Gough, Omar Shariff and the unforgettable Peter Cushing as a Swedish bookstore owner.When watching it, I mightn't have been always laughing out loud, but at least this rollicking spoof manages to provoke a wry smile on my face.",8,1,1,12 September 2006
Predator," Intergalactic big-game hunting.
","I remember when I first heard about this when I was a kid, and what stuck in mind was that it featured humans that have been horrifically skinned by an outer-space visitor. Well my eyes lit up, but at the time my parents wouldn't let me watch this, despite my constant begging. I even played the video game (that was on the old-school 'Nintendo') before seeing the movie. So when I got around to seeing it. I was totally wrapped by it, that it became one of my favourite films. Maybe I don't hold it up that high now, but I do enjoy getting it out and reliving the fun of that nostalgic period. There are no pretensions here. What we get is a no-brainer, punishing sci-fi action joint that relishes in its gripping intensity, barnstorming violence, macho performances and vastly superior alien design by Stan Winston.The stereotypical story is minimal and rather unimportant because it's all about big guns, little words to lead on to the inevitable match-up between the Predator and Arnold Schwarzenegger. What a perfect choice it was to have Arnie involved, also where else can you see him cover himself with mud. Around this time he was at his prime (where many of my favourite Schwarzenegger efforts originate), and surrounding him was an appealing, and well fitted cast featuring Carl Weathers, Bill Duke and Jesse Venture. They weren't the greatest of actors, but nonetheless were convincing in their chemistry and delivering on the action. In the Predator suit was the towering Kevin Peter Hall. This outstanding design was unique, from the ability to camouflage to its thermal imaging POV shots and the collection of weapons made this one unforgettable Hollywood monster creation. Everything about the special effects still stands up today. What this boils down to is the flow of action and well-timed suspense, and there are many commendable, almighty sequences that go hand-to-hand with the stinking hot and thickly lush jungle terrain. The location does grow tighter, and superbly alienates. Alan Silvestri's atmospheric music score is filled with scorching cues, and a foreboding presence that pierces the humid air. Testosterone fills the script, with constant one-liners, which are quite memorable. Only his second feature at the time, director John McTiernan's vigorously upbeat and confident style would go to feature prominently in his career. This man knew how to get the blood pumping, and cook up effectively powerful visuals and thrills from nothing all that special.Satisfyingly fun, brash and macho 80s action / sci-fi that doesn't wimp out on you.",8,2,3,20 March 2008
The Thing," Sci-Fi / Horror that hits all the right chords!
","At a remote Antarctic research station a twelve-man American research party encounter some crazy Norwegians chasing a dog near their campsite. After shooting one of their team members, the Norwegian is shot dead. Trying to discover what made them turn out like this they head to their station, but instead they find something of unknown origin slightly burned up outside in the snow. They bring it back to find out that it's some sort of alien form that's fused together human parts. After more research into it they find out it was buried in the ice for centuries and that it's an aggressive shape-shifter. Soon enough it starts imitating the inhabitants of the base. Causing strained tension and hostile confrontations as everyone starts to turn on each other.Halloween might have been my first John Carpenter experience, but it was this one, which blew me away and got me really into the horror genre. 'The Thing' used to always get played on late night TV and I never missed the opportunity to sit up and watch it. I always believed that it's the best time to watch this cult classic and on this occasion I did the same again, but I had to watch it on DVD this time around. Since this basically bombed at the box-office, because of the bad timing of its released. With it coming out straight after 'ET'. Pretty much it was suicide. But gradually over the years this has deservedly become a cult favourite through video amongst horror and Sci-Fi fans. The film still holds up remarkably well today and surely was unfairly dismissed when it came out. Also the poster artwork for the film is one of the best I've seen. Carpenter was on a great trot at the time and definitely was at his pinnacle, with such films like 'Escape from New York', 'The Fog', 'Halloween' and 'Assault on Precinct 13' coming before it.'The Thing' is a experimental remake of Howard Hawk's 'The Thing from another World', but instead Carpenter was far more faithful to John W. Campbell's story 'Who goes there', by getting the alien to conceal itself inside it's victim and never seeing the being in its natural form. Compared with the walking vegetable that had a striking resemblance to Frankenstein in Hawk's version. It's hard not to compare the two, with each one having a stronger point over the other, but for me I have to go with the '82' version. Anyhow, I just gotta say I love the burning imprint of the film's title in the opening. That scene alone sends chills down my spine and tells you what's to come.The story is far from groundbreaking, but the same can't be said about Rob Bottin's daring make-up effects, which simply are astoundingly revolting. Even today they still hold a huge amount of impact in creating a horrific vibe. Really, these grotesque monster effects are incredibly menacing and freaky, but heck these creations are ugly. The gore is worked in rather nicely, with enough blood splatter involved. Like I said the story isn't something out of the ordinary, but the paranoia part of it is beautifully constructed. This is helped by a well diverse group of moody characters that start losing it slowly and Carpenter turns up the notch by seemingly tightening the confines, where the feel of isolation and tension is sustained to the very end. I thought the ambiguity of the conclusion was fitting enough to the overall context. Claustrophobic brilliance on Carpenter's part. Even the story can be class a metaphor about trust and how it's not so easy to come by now. Carpenter creates a very sombre and downbeat atmosphere that goes very well with the cold conditions of the setting. Underneath it all it has an apocalyptic awe about it, where it looks like there's nothing anybody can do about this concealed being. What complements the chilling feel of dread is Ennio Morricone's throbbing score that's simply sublime in awe. The score packs a real unsteadiness and showers the flick with such vigorousness. Pretty much it does alienate you to what's happening on screen.The performances are reasonably solid, though nothing really to write home about. Kurt Russell is perfect as the lead figure and his charismatic presence proves it. The rest are nothing more than pawns in this game of control. They do seem a little bit more one-dimensional, but still they give such raw performances that add more to the realism factor. Also the chemistry between the men is quite believable. Although, one thing that kept on bugging me, was why they would go off alone when that creature is on the loose. Although that helped on the red herrings and crackling suspense. Where the film stumbles a bit, can be found on the script. The characters were more full and dialogue less stilted, in Howard's film. That's were I thought 'The Thing from another World' really had the wood over 'The Thing'. It built more on the characters. But saying that there was enough suspense built up and sardonic wit in the dialog here. The heated dialog did really warmed up proceedings. The production design is perfect in every inch. From the assured cinematography with many neat angle shots to the creepy, but authentic looking station and its dark and freezing corridors. Another thing to touch a nerve were the echoing sound effects, with the gusty wind making a big impression and the eerie howling from the thing just makes your hairs stand up. Carpenter's ace direction manages to mix gruesome images with psychological elements to achieve an sensational viewing that makes you grab hold of anyone/anything tightly and leaves you with some memorable sequences fresh in mind.A definite Horror / Sci-Fi milestone. Sure it isn't flawless, but it's crafted with a passion to shock, but also compel. Although it's the innovative effects, which will make sure that it's remembered for many years to come.",10,11,16,18 February 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," No mercy!
","The Carter family is on a vacation heading to California, but on the way there they stop off at gas station in the New Mexico desert. The old guy who works there tells them of a short cut they could take to get to their destination quicker. So on that advice, they take the detour and suddenly moments into the trip the tyres blow out and they have a serve crash. This was no accident and the family find out it's a nuclear test sight and soon enough they encounter a band of rampaging cannibalistic, mutants (caused by nuclear testing) who live amongst the mountains. These brutes taunt their hapless victims and leave behind such bloody macabre. So, the few survivors, group up after the ambush and try to stay alive as there isn't a hope in hell anyone is going to come to their aid in this wasteland.I was waiting in growing appreciation to see this flick and I finally got the chance when I made my way to the opening screening at my local cinema. And I gotta say, I wasn't disappointed at all. Far from it. For me it's on par with Wes Craven's original film. I enjoyed Craven's film, but I'm not a massive fan. So I went in their with an open mind (like you should always do) and I liked it. Simple as that. I always thought there was room for improvement and while, director Alexandre Aja's version ups the ante. I just couldn't pick which was one better. Both have certain advantages and disadvantages over each other. But if you enjoyed the original you'll most likely get something out of Aja's take.Producer Wes Craven decided to get director Alexandre Aja's to craft out a remake of his beloved cult film. This is Alexandre Aja's second feature, who debuted with 'High Tension (2003)'. This top grade remake (the best in a long time) is an impressing and immensely well done, bone rattling experience that Aja has tapped into. The premise sticks pretty close the original's plot outline with little changes and details making their way into the script and background story. The most noticeable of the lot has to be the expansion on the mutants back story involving miners and radiation testing, but also notable is their lack of dialogue and personality structure. The aim here seems more like creating a monstrous aspect that focuses on the deformities and sheer aggression to belt out terror than just the bizarre nature of the ones' in the original who seemed more human and in control of their actions. I did miss the iconic performance of Michael Berryman, though.The social commentary seemed much more stronger here with the gripes against the governments' nuclear testing. The images we see prove that. While, the transformation subtext behind one character is to show a geeky pacifist resort to his primal instincts prove that when we come to shove we are no better than the ones who evoke such horror. We can't hide behind our shells because when it comes down to survival our true nature takes hold as you look out for yourself and loves one at any given consequence. What the film had going for it was that you can't help but go through what the family does. You feel every painstakingly, brutal and discomforting second of it that folks suffer through. Director Aja knows how to extract such a gruelling, intensity that just reaches boiling point when the unbearably, punishing attacks occur with its extremely vivid and brutal violence. It would be totally offensive and hard going for the uninitiated, but the nihilistic violence is a essential part of the story's moral justification. Aja has guts and he heightens these fierce attacks with such morbidity and generates an unsettling air with some very effective jumps. Even before the mayhem occurs he adds in some cheap thrills that still have the impact to startle before it hits breaking point.The atmosphere is thick, but not as raw and claustrophobic like Craven's was. This is mostly due to the budget being definitely better here. While the remake might seemed more polished around the edges, it didn't lose any effect in alienating the audience in this desert-less wasteland. Even the fast cutting didn't bother me too much, which I usually can't stand. The films looks magnificent with the eerie details and erratic camera-work that gives it a real rush. While, the opening half hour and interludes between the grilling attacks are rather tolerable. I was surprise as I thought maybe it would lose its way within these parts but the performances and a above-average script kept me glued. There were four performances that stood out and they would have to be Aaron Stanford as Doug, Dan Byrd as Bobby, Emilie de Ravin as Brenda and Robert Joy as one of the mutants, Lizard. The family here might be your typical nucleus, but they were a likable bunch at least. The mutants make-up was tip-top and they definitely looked the part when they broke into these jolting tussles. But what made the film for me had to be the stingingly, pulsating score, which shook you about at every possible opportunity by lampooning you at every single side.There's no denying, the film is repellently, in-your-face but it successfully terrifies when it tightens the screw. The violence towards the end might lose that sense of realism that eventuated throughout most of the film, but the maniac actions of it is not too distracting from the overall feel. A faithful venture into the old school genre of horror where the splatter is unflinching, themes underline the story and the air is very grim.",8,0,4,20 April 2006
Heartbreak Ridge," No easy push over.
","This might not have been one of my favourites by Clint Eastwood, but as it is it remains purely macho entertainment with plenty of crude quips and Eastwood chewing up the scenery with his no-bull attitude. At times it was amusing to wait upon what degrading comment would come out of his mouth towards his rebellious recruits or higher ranking officers. Eastwood as the tough, grizzled and razor tongue Sgt. was perfect for the role.Gunnery Sgt. Tom Highway is a highly awarded relic of past wars, but is finding himself constantly in trouble with the law with his boozing ways. He's given one more chance which sees him heading back home to train-up a ramshackle recon platoon, while aggravating superiors and hopefully reuniting with his ex-wife.Very formulaic, but reactionary new breed vs. old dinosaurs format where the times have changed, but when it comes down to it war is war where rules and polices count for nothing when you're trying to survive. Back to traditional planning, which makes a difference when you got someone who knows what they're doing? The platoon's attitude at first is rebellious, until Sgt. Highway puts them though the ringer to show what they can achieve and from this they learn to respect him over time because of what he sees in them despite what other officials have in mind. Most of the film/or narrative spends with Eastwood clashing with superiors, training/motivating his recruits and trying to rekindle his relationship with his ex by trying to understand her. So after the 90 minute mark, the combat hit's the screen and this is where the recruits are thrown right into it with their yahoos being silenced as what they experience truly humbles them. It opens up their eyes to the fact that war isn't games and heroics but looking after your fellow mates by making the right decisions. The exhilarating gunfire is well implemented, but does lack the punch.Eastwood keeps it nitty-gritty with his economical direction, if maybe a little too long-winded in its length. James Carabatsos's thinly plotted material can play up some comedy elements, but they do fit to what's happening around it. There's also a good commendable cast to boot. Everett McGill as a Major going at loggerheads with Eastwood was a great sight. Mario Van Peebles is quite colourful as one the recruits and Marsha Mason has a lot bite as the ex-flame. There's quite likable support by Eileen Heckart, Arlen Dean Snyder, Boyd Gaines, Tom Villard and a small part for Bo Svenson.",6,2,3,22 May 2010
Cross of Iron," Peckinpah puts you in the trenches.
","Sam Peckinpah's films always seem to leave a lasting impression on me and his brilliantly audacious and harrowing anti-war account 'Cross of Iron' simply had me thinking of his classic western 'The Wild Bunch'. Both focused on a dying breed of men, hoping for better times in a changing environment and let's not forget the sweat, the blood and the male comradeship. Peckinpah's humidly brute if candid war drama takes on the point of view of a weary battalion of German soldiers on the front line against the advancing Russian military towards the end of the Second World War. The raging testosterone is evident, from the use of a hardy script, hard-bitten performances weaved together by a genuine rapport and the gratuitous shots of raw violence, as Peckinpah is not afraid to show blood and guts spilling out with numerous ear-splitting explosions and rapid gunfire raging throughout. However there's something rather beautifully voluptuous in the way he engineers it, as it comes across as poetry in motion or a wet dream in its exciting barrage of pumped up machismo, but also taking time out for some more lighter touches too. He has always been a great visualiser, where the arrestingly intense action is grounded with an authentic tough as nails edge that never loses sight of the brutal outcome it engraves -- psychically and mentally. Running through the jadedly versatile story is an unflinching moral card, but its angle on classes (feuding rivalry between German officers in who really deserves heroic credit --- even begs the question why the glorification in a losing war and the ones who should be held up our those unknown soldiers fighting up front) and the motivations behind individuals only goes on to make it more so powerful (with the ironic ending cementing it), jolting and deep in its impulsive structure and emotional arcs by not only concentrating on the cynical acts, but the innocent face of war. While gritty and blunt, it remains technically sharp and is effectively photographed like the spectacular slow-motion during the large-scale battle sequences. Maybe a little too long in the tooth, but it never lets up for it two hour plus running time. James Coburn heads up the cast in a magnificently tough-skinned performance and across from him is a dominating Maximilian Schell. Also there's sensational humane support from the likes of Klaus Löwitsch, James Mason and a bitter looking David Warner.",9,1,2,27 March 2010
Resident Evil," So it has begun. Press start to begin.
","Located in Racoon City is the Umbrella Corporation headquarters, where in an secret underground compound called the 'The Hive' one of their experiments known as the 'T-Virus' is unknowingly released. So the main computer system 'The Red Queen' locks everyone in 'The Hive', which the virus turns every living thing in the facility into fleshing eating zombies. So, a military crack force is sent in to shut down the main computer and pick up any survivors within three hours. One of them they come across is Alice who's suffering amnesia, but she slowly starts to puts the pieces together, while confronting this massive problem.I remember when I was originally going to see this at the cinema, but a friend of mine conned me out of it, in which we saw the sentimentally, wretched war flick 'We Were Soldiers' instead. Well, I finally got around to seeing it after all of those years and well, meh! Now I just wonder what got me interested in it in the first place. I'm no fanatic of the video game and I have no idea how true it is to the story, but from what I've seen of the game. Anderson was no were near in capturing the dark and creepy atmosphere. Alternatively he brings his loud, rapid and glossy stylistic touches that find its way in most of his other films. I actually don't mind his earlier efforts like; the enjoyable rubbish 'Mortal Kombat' and the mildly creepy 'Event Horizon', but this project and even more so 'Alien vs. Predator' I found mindlessly under whelming and kinda flat. Sure, I'm not expecting a meaningful masterpiece (although some specifics and character development wouldn't hurt), but the entertainment factor is rather botch. Maybe if I saw it when I was initially going to, I might've got more out of it and see it in a different manner. Since obviously its aimed at a certain target audience and to make a profitable franchise. I just found it far from gripping and the involvement was really lacking. That can be contributed to the story (which has decent plot device) that seems to go nowhere and the stock characters are pretty vague with their cheesy one-liners and thin dialogue.Well, since that was the case I was hoping the action, blood splatter and zombie madness would spice up this shindig! I'll admit the film has a couple of striking set-pieces and the pace keeps the film moving, but these aspects lose out to the 'Look at my shinning new toy! I don't know how it works, but it looks great!' attitude. The film visually looks good. But it just got caught up trying to be too flashy in it's snazzy techno appearance than actually executing some tension, excitement or even some gore. Instead we get cheap jump scares that are plain predictable, lame slow-motion, tame combat and pretty clumsy, looking CGI. You got the usual chaotic editing worked around the slick camera-work that captures the crisp art direction. Surrounding these glossy fixtures is an impulsively, blaring techno mental soundtrack. Style definitely wins out here! The performances were rather vapid, though Milla Jovovich fits the buck in the lead role. She might not have much to do but to kick ass, but she does makes the most out of her undeveloped character. Michelle Rodriguez plays a very lazy stereotype; the tough female soldier who won't take any crap! The characters here actually share a real common interest with those in 'Aliens', but at least in that movie that had interesting personalities. *Hmm* Now I'm sitting here looking at the DVD cover of 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse', which has on the front cover 'Bigger, better, action-packed'. Well, hopefully it lives up to that wrap or, maybe it will be equally forgettable.No way is it awful. But simply, it's a weak and very dumb action-video game hybrid that lacks the firepower and is unintentionally laughable when it came to shove.",4,0,1,28 April 2006
Alien vs. Predator," Nothing special.
","An expedition travels to Antarctica to explore an underground pyramid, but they soon realize it's a training arena for the predators to practice their skills against the Alien Queen's offspring.Being a fan of both franchises I decided to check it out and what I got was an over blown mess. I give due credit to the designs of the predators & aliens and the special effects were good. The problems were that the story seemed really flat and soulless, the lack of suspense, the humans were really just one dimensional bystanders, shallow performances because of the lack of characterisation and lacking a strong lead ( I agree with a friend that Lance Henrisksen was wasted). I thought the aliens seemed to play second fiddle to much, with much of it centered on the Predators.Though It has SOME good moments it gets incredibly cheesy and I couldn't help but snigger at how lame it got in the last half an hour. When the credits started rolling I thought... geez is that it and I left the cinema thinking at least I saw it on cheap ass Tuesday. I heard that some believe that the classification of the film was why it was a disappointment but really it would've made no difference as it would've been the same story and bland characters. A pretty average film and a forgettable one too.2/5",4,0,1,20 October 2004
Batman Begins," Good film, but not great.
","After seeing his parents gunned down as a child, the billionaire Bruce Wanye (Christian Bale) becomes obsessed with vengeance and so he leaves Gotham City begins a journey to truly understand criminals' minds and from that he becomes a lost soul in a Bhutan jail. Then he encounters Ducard (Liam Neeson) who offers him a chance to join The League of the Shadows who vanquish evil. This is where Wayne learns mental and physical methods of training and to conquer his own fear and to use it to help him over throw evil. He returns to Gotham City to see it filled with corruption led by crime kingpin Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson), the family company is interested in profit rather than people and his childhood sweetheart (Katie Holmes) is a spirited assistant attorney of a corrupt justice system. This is when Wayne decides to make a symbol and with the fear of bats that haunted him (childhood accident), he directs this fear into the ultimate creation Batman. He then recruits the help of weapon designer (Morgan Freeman) who works at his company to design gadgets for him and that of an honest cop (Gary Oldman).Did I go in with high expectations for the film after reading and hearing mostly good things about it? Yes, I've only read and heard one ordinary review, so come on! After reading nothing but good things you would think this must be brilliant. So, was the hype justified? Hmm well, I wasn't that hugely impressed with what I saw and I usually enjoy seriously dark and bleak films. It was a fine film I would say, but not great. Was it blown out of proportions? Maybe not? To me it's far from ordinary, but it just didn't blow me away like for others. I guess I'm part of a small minority.What I did like was the art direction, which was outstanding in capturing such a seedy and murky atmosphere of corruption and menace that is Gotham City. The towering Gotham City suited that of the creature of the night with its dimly lit streets and throbbing shadows creating such uneasy intensity. The production valves were simply opulent and glossy in quality. The dark knight's suit keeps clear of over-the-top suits of 'Batman Forever' and 'Batman & Robin' (which overshadowed that film) and in doing so it captures a figure of dread that causes sheer terror and irresistibly subtle in appearance. Which it surely deserves, than that of some fashion statement. On show is a supreme cast. The performances were riveting and that especially goes for the charismatic Michael Caine as Alfred and Cillian Murphy as the sly Dr. Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow. They were the standout performances in my honest opinion. Katie Holmes definitely felt miscast, but her performance wasn't bad. Christian Bale was perfect and suited the presence of the smooth Bruce Wayne and silent and imposing figure of Batman. The likes of Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman made the most of their support roles. Tom Wilkinson and Liam Neeson were so-so in their roles. The script stood out with its intensely sharp and edgy dialogue and dry humour that suited the film.Though saying that, I didn't find it particularly enjoyable entertainment. Interesting setup yeah, but the film and story just didn't surprise me (the twist involving Liam Neeson's character) or make me think it was anything too special. One thing that got on my nerves was how choppy the action scenes felt and how they really zoomed into those scenes without any clarity or flair. The film felt like it was lacking a strong villain in my eyes, as there was too many that came and went. The Scarecrow was engrossing and rather creepy, but we didn't get much depth out of him nor screen time liked I wished. Carmine Falcone was that of a standard villain and Ducard lacked bite well, for me he did. The harrowing story lacked real substance and at times it felt kind of flat. It just came across as trying to fit too much into the story, especially towards the end when the quality and originality started to decline in the final 30-minutes, with schematic action sequences, plot details and finale. Though, the plots psychological drama that fills the first half of the film was gripping.I actually left the cinema feeling rather blank and nor do I care if I don't see it again. Even though this is more faithful and superior to that of the other Batman films, I'll stick with Burton's hammy/cartoonish versions. His Batman films aren't flawless, but I got more out of them.To sum it up it's not that bad because of smart casting, solid script and a backdrop that looked extraordinary, but overall it just didn't pull me in like I hoped. Though, I give credit to the crew for trying a new ambitious take that goes for a more serious, darker and detail evolution of the Batman legend and thank goodness they steered clear of the abomination they call 'Batman & Robin'.",6,2,5,27 June 2005
1941," Stretched for laughs
","Just after the attack on Pearl Harbour, hysterical erupts in America and a small coastal town. As they believe that the Japanese are going to bomb America next, which causes a lot of havoc in the Californian town by the incompetent military and the eager locals.This is an over-the-top and quite noisy broad comedy by director Steven Spielberg. I wouldn't class this a great or smart parody on the anxiety and fear of war. This extravaganza was leaning more towards clunky stupidity, but it had enough enjoyable moments and ''some'' fair performances to keep you riveted. Though, actually the opening scene in the film does have a great spoof on ''Jaws'', but mostly they are far and in between many unfunny scenes. The film just came across as overblown nonsense.Quite an expensive budget was given to Spielberg for this film and you can tell. With the in-your-face special effects, the raging destruction, loud explosions and a stack of stars from the era. Well, some of these stars were wasted in obscure and humourless roles or actually lack of a role because there was probably too many involved. Though Aykroyd, Pickens (the best two parody performances), Allen, Lee, Stack, Betty and Belushi (definitely the worst performance) try to make the most of their characters, but they just can't make up for flat and uninspiring direction, inept script and story. The film kind of limped along in the last hour and the slapstick humour started to wore thin. It was lacking wit and satire to make entirely entertaining. The direction lacked execution and the plot is nothing more than a mess of skits and gags. With some comical situations being dragged on for far too long, becoming a bit tiresome (especially Belushi's gags). As well the two hour running time of the film doesn't help the plodded pace and lack of story. The many stars that appear ranged from Dan Aykroyd as the informative and quite spirited Sgt. Frank Tree and his tank, John Belushi as the daft Capt. Wild Bill Kelso, Christopher Lee as the demanding Nazi Capt. Wolfgang Von Kleinschmidt, Nancy Allen as the exquisite Donna Stratton with a airplane fetish, Tim Matheson as the desperate Capt. Loomis Birkhead desperately trying to get laid by Stratton, Ned Betty as the obsessed gun-ho local Ward Douglas, Lorraine Grey as Mrs. Douglas, Robert Stack as the down-to-earth Maj. Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell, Warren Oates as the whack-out Col. 'Madman' Maddox who believes he is under attack by the Japanese, Slim Pickens as the hilarious Hollywood and the under-used John Candy as the bumbling Pvt. Foley.While the look of the film is an added plus. Not bad location setting and the special effects are eye candy, with some superb action scenes. The sound effects also has good amount of impact and the score was fair. Though, overall all of it just doesn't gel together and so it becomes quite a botch.For me it ranks along aside 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park '97' as his weakest film.This is a truly uneven film by one of the greatest directors, but still worth a look if you're a fan of his.",4,2,5,29 April 2005
No Man's Land," A No-Win Situation
","Three soldiers one Serb and two Bosnians are caught up in a countryside trench in no man's land between Serbian and Croatian lines, while the UN unwillingly gets involved in the situation because of media pressure.This film is a critical satire of the meaningless of war and on how no one wants to get involved- but actually sit back (the UN) and watch or actually film the carnage (the media). It depicts the bleakness of the war, the UN's involvement and the intruding media presentation of it in black humour and sharp sarcasm, while still the suspense and the humanity of the situation doesn't get discarded- but makes it more fascinating and quite constructive.The intelligent script and story are very fresh in portraying the madness of war and also building up the tension that never falters, as we see how much the two countries hate each other, with the soldiers continuously blaming each other for the war and the stupidity of the situation that they are in. It was definitely an unpredictable and confronting war story that didn't try to manipulate the circumstances for a change- but actually draws you into the mess.The thing is at first you don't feel any for sorrow for the soldiers separately, as they are no worse than each other- but then after while we come to know them in detail and see their point of view. The main hatred you feel is towards the UN Leaders, as they sit back, unwilling to budge, while their soldiers sit around wanting to help... you would know what I mean especially at the end of the film, as the ending really does pack a punch and makes you question humanity.Not only the UN's priorities and methods are questioned- but also the artful and shallow media that see this as good news scoop then actually coming across as caring for the welfare of the soldiers. There's one quote that provides that point from a news reporter that declines to film the bunker and explains that when you've seen one bunker, you've seen them all which is pretty ironic, well you'll what I mean when you see it.The performances are impressive and truly absorbing from the three soldiers caught in this mess: Branko Djuric as Ciki, Rene Bitorajac as Nino and Filip Sovagovic as Cera . This film reminded very much of 'Three Kings' in the humour side of things, but also the grief you feel for those involved in the war- but 'No man's land' is far more involving and far less buoyant than 'Three Kings'.What you get is a solid anti-war film that keeps you gripped to the end and when it finishes, it definitely leaves you pondering.",9,66,117,7 April 2005
Kelly's Heroes," You won't be getting any negative waves from me!
","During WW2, the USA army are battling the Germans in France and former Lieutenant now Pvt. Kelly abducts a German official to get some information out of him, but instead he accidentally learns that there is a fortune of gold bars in a bank behind enemy lines. So, Kelly comes up with a mad scheme, which his misfit platoon get involve and those you can help out in the plan of sneaking in to knock off the million dollars in gold. While this is happening, Major General Colt who's tracking them on the radio believes that these passionately brave soldiers are leading the way in, trying to win the war single handedly, but we know otherwise.Whoa! There's nothing but all guns blazing in this big production well, also throw in zillions of flourishing explosions causing a lot of loud bangs which amount to pure destruction and during the night sequences a spectacular light show every now again. This continuously runs for over two hours! That may seem overlong, but it doesn't feel it. That's because in never takes a break, well not a long one at least and because of that there's a brisk pace about it. So, you surely can't ask more. But this hybrid, comic book war flick doesn't just only go gung-ho, but it also mixes in a real jokey script that never disrupts the balance between the bouncy humour and dead serious moments. Very much, it successfully gels the two together. Actually if you've seen 'Three Kings (1999)', you'll know what to expect, as it's very similar to that film. The humour and central idea are actually very close. Other then an economically clever script, an excellent ensemble cast help keep this from turning into an outrageous spoof. You could say it's a vehicle for the stars, even though too many stars can spoil the brew, but here it comes through with flying colours. Clint Eastwood might get top billing here, but it's his co-stars that mostly chew up the screen time. These are very much larger than life characters in this platoon full of wise guys. Eastwood gives a steely performance as Pvt. Kelly. You got Telly Savalas as MSgt. Big Joe the demanding father figure of the platoon. Don Rickles as Crapgame, who always like to speak his mind. Carroll O'Connor plays the hilarious Major General Colt and finally the most memorable of all would be Donald Sutherland's sweet talking hippie tank-man Oddball. He makes a great opening entrance and his dialog has a lasting impression! 'Have a little faith.' Also you got the likes of Harry Dead Stanton, Gavin MacLeod and Hal Buckley. The superb chemistry between all was that of first class. What made it great was that when there was no action occurring, you got humorously great exchanges between the believable characters.Director Brian G. Hutton who also directed Eastwood in the solid 'Where Eagles Dare (1968)' comes up with a grand scale war/heist flick that builds up some tension in certain scenarios. These can be found in the opening sequence, and especially in the minefield scene and of course the final battle for the gold in a sleepy town. Also he provides some enterprising periods like that towards the end of the flick with the final showdown in the town square that reminisce something out of a spaghetti western. Well, it did have a western theme song playing through it. That was a nice added touch. The camera work is pretty standard, but does break the ice at times with some flair. The pounding and sometimes rattling score pretty much stuck with the standard themes like that of the drum based to trumpet playing that you hear in most war films, but it did cater for all moods. Plus the theme song may seem dated, but the buoyant tune 'Burning bridges' by The Mike Curb Congregation does have an everlasting charm about it. Under all that haywire and spicy banter script is an anti-war slogan, but that never gets in the way of the entertainment valve. So does it hit any hurdles? Well if it did, it went unnoticed by me.Being an Eastwood fan I've made it an aim to see every flick of his, so far I haven't come across many I don't like. There's something about his subtle presence in films that I find it simply irresistible that it's hard to take my eyes of off. But here, he had a lot of other great performances to work off. This is purely a boy's own adventure here to entertain with its rising excitement levels and chirpy humour that's never far away. Highly entertaining war caper with plenty of ka-boom!",8,3,4,2 March 2006
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Stimulating visuals and kick-ass female leads, but not much else.
","The film begins with a recap of what happened at the end of the last film with Alice waking up to discover Racoon city dead empty. After this we see the virus is released by some Umbrella workers who go into the hive to check what had happen and in doing so, they release the virus and these zombies into the city. To counter attack this problem Umbrella decides to seal off the city even with many uninfected citizens and law-enforcements getting left behind. Alice discovers that she has been injected with a virus, which has given her superhuman abilities. She also come across a small group of survivors led by officer Jill Valentine that she teams up with after being contacted by doctor who wants them to find his daughter and in exchange he'll get them out before Umbrella nukes their mishap.Now this felt like a video game, but that doesn't mean its actually a good film. I found it to be an improvement over the unexceptional first flick, but not by too much. The original film was directed by Paul Anderson, but he decided to go with the 'Alien vs. Predator' project instead of directing this piece. He might not have directed the film, but he did write the screenplay for sequel. Instead debut director Alexander Witt sits in the director's chair and brings to the series a far more expansive cookie cutter action flick that's very nice to look at. Well, that is the case when you can see what's happening! Just like the first film this one is just as slick and overly showy in detail. But what did become distracting was the constant use of stupid slow-motion and hasty editing that just got in the way of some of the action. Witt goes out of his way to up the action in leaps and bounds. While, these moments might be longer and be filled with many stylistic Matrix touches, but they just seemed quite pedestrian and unexciting at times. The fast and furious camera-work and pounding metal soundtrack is what gave these scenes its jumpy and highly-powered bursts. It just falls in the same hole as the first film with the arty techniques taking over the show, but at least on this occasion there was more brainless action to go around within it's flashy imprints. What I found a crime was that, where was the splatter? Yep, the violence is watered down and even far more than the previous flick, but the CGI effects were slightly better. The monster make-up is top-notch, though. The morbid claustrophobic atmosphere of 'The Hive' in the first is replaced here with an subdued post-apocalyptic presence in the city.Again the ragged plot and characters are secondary to the gloss and glitter of the production. The basic story sets up a typical small group of one-dimensional survivors trying to survive from a horde of zombies, rabid dogs and a mutant killing machine and at the end it gets us geared up for another sequel. It's the usual fluff with many incoherent and illogical lapses and cardboard, comic characters. The plot throws in everything but the kitchen sink from that of the power and influence of the corporation to flashbacks and heroic nonsense. But they don't bother to make too much sense of it with the inane script coming across with the standard clichÃ© dialogue. They even try to demonstrate some humour with a comic relief character played by Mike Epps that draws more duds and only adds to the misfire. The humour just feels miscast, but Epps' performance is the most lively. The other performances are reasonably cold, but I thought that the always sexy Milla Jovovich was fine and kicked ass again, but really she wasn't given enough to do and she should've been made the centrepiece. Sienna Guillory looked great as the strong willed, mini-skirt wearing Jill Valentine. While, the support roles from Oded Fehr, Sandrine Holt, Zack Ward and Jared Harris are thin at best.'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' is a boisterous and overblown piece of junk that just can't keep still for too long. Well, at least this popcorn flick does kinda entertain and gladly flies by quick enough. Amen!",4,5,9,3 May 2006
Grave of the Fireflies," One for the unknown victims.
","Just marvellous! This hearty masterpiece of Japanese animation is incredibly moving, sincere, haunting and captivating in detailing the special bond between brother and sister caught up in the horrifying and unforgiving face of war. It guides us on one really tragic, but rewarding trip where it truly has an impact. Never does it get overwrought or push itself onto the viewer, but still it manages to leave a lump in your throat and have you emotionally drained when the credits begin to roll. This one is not afraid to stay gloomy, and because you know the outcome at the beginning, this makes the significance of the story's journey more potentate in its increasing pain and devastation. By that alone, the wonderfully textured plot doesn't take the easy way out and the reality of the situation is never lost because it's animated.Staying simple and focused, kept it rather flawless in its in-depth story telling of emotional pride and lasting effects. Slow it might be, but there's too much subtle richness within its characters, premise and visuals to really bother about the loose pacing and lack of action. Isao Takahata adapts the novel of Akiyuki Nosaka, and gets us deeply involved with the civilians, and the mere war stays in the background. A contrast between two different worlds, one being the war itself and secondly the one the two children find themselves in to forget it. Namely those scenes where they're experiencing the beauty and freeness of nature (at if they might never get that chance again) and those sequences with the fireflies admirably paint the feelings of what's to come. The budding relationship between Seita and Setsuko is tremendously done, innocent and full of colour. Even capturing the Japanese citizens and families in this cold plight is believability achieved, as it throws questions, issues and metaphorical messages. These people (including our two central characters) are doing it hard, but their wills won't collapse after what they've been through, but things do take their toll when everything you ever care for can suddenly vanish and the heartache turns to utter numbness. Because what kept you living, is no longer there to hold you.Breathing heavily on the mood is the soft, lovely musical score that certainly weeps with its melodic tone. The vivid animation is gorgeously crisp and enchanting, and the background scenery is profoundly vivid and convincing. Many beautiful, striking illustrations are framed with a sincere touch, where darkness treads neatly together with the lighter moments. What a delightfully effective and soulful meditation piece of sublime art by director/writer Isao Takahata. This one has plenty to say on the topic at hand, and it gets even more relevant everyday.Magnificently heart-wrenching and sensitive war-time story on the people who find themselves dealing with the unbearable consequences of war.",10,10,11,8 August 2007
The Fly," Gets better every time.
","The first time I came across it, I wasn't hugely impressed. I was young, hoping for a mindless creature-feature outing and it was my first taste of David Cronenberg. That being many moons ago. But upon each viewing since then, it has really grown on me. To the point of little details I missed, making it feel like I'm watching it for the first time again. It's simple, but really engages on an emotional level.This saw director David Cronenberg (the master of body horror) take the concept from the 1958 version of 'The Fly' (which starred one of horror icons Vincent Price) to put his own unique spin on the science-fiction/horror material. His perception was far from conventional, but still a real success. It was an ambitious, admirable and intelligent display.The straightforward love story beautifully compliments the demented and tragic events awaiting and only Cronenberg could think up something like this. The mental and physical transformation of Jeff Goldblum's scientist character Seth Bundle caused by a scientific project gone awry is expertly projected. Goldblum's confidently twitchy performance is outstanding even behind all that gross make-up FX. The growing affection towards Veronica (a stably strong Geena Davis) the journalist covering his groundbreaking work draws you in even more. There's plenty of convincing character developments that when the slow, but effective groundwork opens up. It's gut-wrenchingly tough and startling with its lyrical dramas and infused visual shocks.John Getz is good in support as Veronica's jealously smug boss/ex-boyfriend. The special effects are impressive and suitably grotesque with many sequences that remain unforgettable and stand-up to this day. Mark Irwin's photography is sharply executed within what's mostly centered on grungy, confined sets. He gives it a real intimate style, which helps keeps the focused on the two leads and the looming ordeals.Cronenberg's remake is pure visionary work that successfully splices a real sensitive side with plain unpleasantness.",9,1,1,24 April 2020
War of the Worlds," A worthy blockbuster!
","Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) a crane operator has to look after his two children (Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin) for the weekend as his ex-wife (Miranda Otto) and her new husband are visiting her parents in Boston. Later on during the day Ray and fellow neighbours are out on the streets watching dark clouds forming up in the sky and there's lighting strikes too. Because of this everything that runs on power becomes dead and including phones. Then suddenly all of the confusion changes to horror when an alien machine comes from the ground and starts terminating people. This causes crowds of hysteria and Ray rushes home and starts on a trip with the kids to get to Boston. Though, these malevolent beings in their machines are popping up everywhere and our out to destroy mankind.This is an adaptation of H.G. Wells classic story of an alien invasion (maybe a metaphor on the wars in the British Empire at the time) which was published in 1898 and well, what can I say about Spielberg's film? It was far better than I expected to be. This blockbuster truly delivered what it was meant to do grand entertainment and nothing more. I wouldn't class it a masterpiece, but still it's very good film and Spielberg at his best. These aliens were far from friendly like those in his earlier films ' Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and 'ET- The Extra-Terrestrial'. There was a lot style behind this film, but it was kind of mediocre on substance.The story concentrates on the family than what's actually happening globally and somehow it still felt a bit thin (probably because the plot is basically hide and go seek) and you can see elements of 9/11 attacks, subtle WW2 images and references on terrorists, but anyhow it had heart and it tells a gripping and unnerving tale. The acting wasn't great in my eyes but it was reasonably fair. It's nowhere as bad like some people make it out to be. Chemistry between the Cruise, Fanning and Chatwin was believable and to you start to care for them the further along the film goes. The witty humour between the three is incredibly enjoyable too. I thought Chatwin's character was by far the most interesting and it was a little disappointing that his character departs halfway into the film. Fanning's performance was good (well, her constant screaming wasn't annoying) and you can see why she hyped to be the next big thing. Cruise came across rather deadpan and lacking bite, especially when his character is the one who carries the story. Maybe a stronger actor would have added something greater, but hey what am I complaining about the film it delivered what it was meant to do and overall you could argue that his performance fitted in with the bleak mood. His portrayal is that of a average block and not of a clean cut hero or ingenious scientist and hardly an ideal father figure too. As he has let down his family in the past, but when this chaos occurs he's someone who focuses on his two children then that of someone trying to help everyone that he passes and he isn't here to save mankind either. His got only one thing on mind and that's to get his children to their mother and he would literally do 'anything' to keep it that way. Tim Robbins plays a traumatized father who lost his family and is hiding out in his basement. He basically plays the nut and does a good job of it, if sometimes a little too over-the-top. I thought some of the scenes involving him did kind of drag on for too long.Though, saying all of that and explaining some minor glitches. I was too entrenched and amazed in the film for those things to really bother me. Starting with the chilling opening intro which is narrated by Morgan Freeman, it just pulls you into an emotional ride with destruction a plenty and surprises, until we get to the sour and overly sweet ending. The astounding special effects are mesmerising and have great impact on the viewer. The sprawling camera-work truly captures the magnificent imagery e.g. the burning train that speeds by. Something just keeps you glued as the disturbing scenes involving the alien machines chasing the humans create such terror and tension. The moody atmosphere of the film is superb in creating such a feel of doom and dread. I just really enjoyed the grim and dark tone of it. It just held such a disturbing vibe to it all. The first half of the film is incredibly gripping and paced very well, but it does slow down in the second half with some extended scenes that went on for too long. When it came to the end I thought how the aliens were defeated and how mankind survived was just too brisk and it turn out to be somewhat of an anti-climax. But after thinking about it more I came to except the reason. Well, Morgan Freeman's narration to end the film truly does convince you of why mankind's fate was spared. Though, the happy but odd family ending didn't work and came across a forced, but that's what you call a small hiccup compared to the rest of the engrossing film. I guess Spielberg just can't let go of a happy ending well, not happy but sappier.For what its worth it's a fairly striking and highly enjoyable ride that has only a few bumps.",7,0,4,5 July 2005
Man on Fire," A hysterically conventional drama/action film.
","A former government operative/alcoholic (Denzel Washington) is given a job to look after a wealthy couple's daughter (Dakota Fanning) in Mexico City. Though, on duty he gets gunned down and the girl is kidnapped. After recovering from his injuries he goes after those who had anything to do with the girls kidnapping.For me ''Man on Fire'' didn't live up to the hype and actually it was rather disappointing. It's a film of two halves. The first being a heart felt relationship between bodyguard and child, while the second half (where the film is let down) turns into a violently graphic vigilante piece. I just don't see the big deal about this film; it's not as smart as it may think it is and it tries so hard to be moving that it just comes across as manipulative and overwrought.This was a simple story and quite an unoriginal one too, really. I didn't mind the first hour, though there were some overly sweet moments, but the chemistry between Washington and Fanning is genuinely good. After the kidnapping it just got too messy and it kinda dragged. Some scenes during that half were so ridiculously ludicrous or just cheesy that you just seem to smirk then really be amazed, because they were so over-the-top, clichéd and at times rather dull. Maybe they could have added some light or black humour into the story or those situations, as there was hardly any to be found. The serious tone and emotional pull that the film had was so pushy in its delivery that it was fairly nauseating when it came to the end. While the abrupt ending just felt like a flat cop out, to be honest. I found it too unsatisfying and hollow to be pleasing and that goes for the formulaic movie as well.The direction by Tony Scott was so distracting with its flashy slow motion, swirling frames, freeze frame and double screens. It was like Scott was trying to make it standout visually, while trying to hide it's been there done that plot. It might look like a fast adrenaline pack film, but really it's the disjointed editing that gives that illusion because it's was mostly slow story telling. The editing was so annoyingly choppy and with its quite jumpy camera work it was really giving me a headache and the noisy and loud soundtrack didn't help either.What a waste of superb actors; Denzel Washington and Christopher Walken. There not bad, but with the lack of depth and material they're given, they deserved much better. The only standout performance for me was Dakota Fanning who shined in her part and Radha Mitchell wasn't bad, but the rest were bystanders in this muddled film. It's not entirely awful as it had some moments of superbly built tension and it truly captures a seedy Mexico City that comes across as one imposing stature.Overall, it's really just an ordinary film that's nothing spectacular or has anything new to show. It's maybe worth look for Fanning's performance, but still the film is equally missable.Ps I really didn't know that this was a remake or that there was an original French/Italy version that starred Scott Glenn, Brooke Adams and Joe Pesci. Well, maybe that's another good thing about this film?",4,3,7,24 May 2005
Centurion," 'I don't know about you, but I'm tired of running'.
","Film-maker Neil Marshall kicked off his career with two outstanding low- budget horror films; 'Dog Soldiers' and 'The Descent'. Quite a promising start. Then followed 'Doomsday', which got a mixed response. I enjoyed it, but it's nothing more than an outrageous homage to post-apocalyptic films like 'Escape to New York' and the 'Mad Max' series. So his fourth outing would see Marshall tackle a swords and sandals revenge pursuit on the frontier of the Roman Empire in 'Centurion'. It's a gritty and brutal tale of survival and courage, where Rome's invasion of northern Britain hit's a bump when they encounter the guerrilla tactics of the tribal enemy the Picts. There's something about it that looks epic thanks to its crisp, sweeping photography, but its minimalist story telling makes sure it doesn't quite complement it. The narrative is a fast-paced, cross-country chase of rugged action and bloody onslaughts amongst beautiful highland scenery. Where the terrain is just as harsh and unforgiving, as the Roman's enemy. I think it loses shape and momentum after the hour mark and the heavy-handed script gives us the usual character arches, but Marshall's stylish verve is slick and taut. The battle scenes are executed in a spectacular manner, where it's a barrage of relentless and gusty combat. Michael Fassbender leads the way as a man looking for redemption and Olga Kurylenko makes an impression as a Pict warrior. Also Dominic West pops up. Simple, but effective action romp that for most part doesn't let up and is masterfully framed.'This is a new kind of war'.",7,1,4,22 November 2014
Scream," Let's have a joke on horror's behalf.
","Sidney Prescott is a high school girl still coming to terms of her mother's murder over a year ago. But things get worst in Woodsboro when a couple of high school students are knocked off and even more so for Sid when a masked killer who loves their scary movies sets their sights on her with some threatening phone calls. Sidney survives the first attempt at her life with the police deciding to keep an eye on her and looking at the many possible suspects. Which range from her out-of-town father to her sex depraved boyfriend. Also the media circus has arrived, led Gail Weathers, which she and Sid don't have too much of a good relationship.The horror boom of the mid 90s is thanks largely to Craven's memorably, refreshing, but post-modern slasher flick 'Scream'. I notice this film really divides the horror fans. People either loathe it or like it, well I fit in the latter half. I'm a fan of the flick since it added something new to the dying sub-genre. Although, most of it imitators were painful, but 'Scream' is miles ahead of those inferior rehashes. What sets it out from most of the artificial slashers is that it's exciting and it has brains. Kevin Williamson's cerebral script parodies the whole slasher set-up remarkably well in a self-aware attitude by exploring the rules that flood these type of films. The way he works in the inventive twists around the usual horror devices only enhances the film's originality and engrossing interplay. While, the gallant script might be cluttered with plenty of in-jokes and horror references. The character's also come to the party with rich details and strong persona's that seem real, which makes you really wanna see them get through. Humour wise it hits it off, but that's not discarding the highly suspenseful thrills. Like that of the well-staged opening that actually frightens and horrifies. Craven not only delivers some hacked up teens, but just like in he did in his 'New Nightmare (1994)' film he plays around with plenty of horror techniques and themes in such a convincing fashion that it's unpredictably intense. Clues and hints are displayed with flair and the alarming amount of red herrings make the mystery even more enjoyable. The characters just seem more rational in their actions since they themselves know the vital rules of slasher flicks, which gives the film more of an urgency and this makes it harder to figure just who'll get out and who will not. The actors on board all put in solid performances with some being more exceptional than others, but at least there was a dynamic chemistry between them all. Neve Campbell nails down her role as the emotional wreak Sidney Prescott. Courtney Cox goes against the grain as the venomous TV reporter Gail Weathers. David Arquette manages to raise some chuckles as the dopey Deputy Dewey. But more so the buoyant Jamie Kennedy gets the laughs with the most interesting character - the horror movie geek Randy Meeks. Mathew Lillard generates a lot fun, Skeet Ulrich is perfect as the shady boyfriend and Rose McGowan gives the film the bite with her cunning remarks. There's also some small amusing roles from Drew Barrymore and Henry Winkler. If you looking for some blood you shouldn't be disappointed as there's a fine build up and a good quota of it. Working with that element is the fitting sound effects which are crisply effective, like that of the knife swishing through the air. An atmospherically, suspenseful score by Marco Beltrami pierces the flick and the mellow soundtrack is rather well assembled in depicting the mood. Especially that of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' haunting tune 'Red Right Hand'. Another factor to set itself out was that of Mark Irwin's well displayed camera-work that lifted off the screen with many prominent shots. Craven keeps it fast moving and Williamson's script makes sure that it delivers a successful outing that works to it's strengths with flying colours.'Scream' is a nice gruesome mix of irony and violence that started up the craze for mainstream horror again and turned horror conventions upside down.",7,0,1,2 May 2006
Prometheus," Caught in two minds.
","I remember looking forward to Prometheus when I heard it was going into production, and the intrigue only grew to see it when released. When I got back from the cinema. I thought it partly delivered on what I expected. And I still feel the same years later after a rewatch. A good Sci-fi/thriller to watch on a big-screen with its grand ambitions and spectacular special effects, but in the end I still felt rather underwhelmed by the storytelling. While inventive, I wouldn't call it enjoyable. Visually enticing, but lyrically muddled. What starts off as collected and rational, only becomes a rash of ideas that are messily pieced together. Sometimes agreeable, but other times not so. Quite hot and cold. Disappointing since its themes are indeed ambitious. I would even throw in its use of suspense. Outside one or two sequences, it just lacked the punch and the momentum to sustain its long-winding build-up. The environment was alienating, but the increasing danger lacked any real sort of impact. Maybe this is because of the writing... mainly due to its rigid character development and choppy plot threads. Outside of Noomi Rapace and most notably Michael Fassbender, no other actor (Charlize theron, Idris Elba, Sean Harris and Guy Pearce) really stands out or leaves a lasting impression. Ridley Scott's direction crafts out many striking set-designs and backdrops are jaw-dropping. While not perfect, it does get you talking after its finished about the flaws, but also its strong themes and imagery.",5,1,1,23 June 2020
Paths of Glory," tremendously gut-wrenching drama
","In 1916 during WW1 French soldiers refused to complete a suicidal attack on an enemy position and retreated to their trenches. So three soldiers are chosen from their platoon to be sentenced to death for cowardice as they have supposedly disgraced the French flag.This is one outstanding anti-war film by Stanley Kubrick, definitely one of his best films if not his best, well maybe behind 'A Clockwork Orange' ;). The performances from Kirk Douglas as the compassionately loyal Col. Dax who is furious about the decision and tries his best to defend his men, Adolphe Menjou as the crazed Gen. George Broulard who has no desire but to see his men punished, Ralph Meeker as the courageous Cpl. Philip Paris one of the three man who is on trail and George Macready as the unsympathetic Gen. Paul Mireau are simply brilliant and downright absorbing in their roles.The story itself extremely packs a bite and captures the intensity of the in-humane situation; because of one failure the soldiers pay the consequences, with their earlier good deeds going unnoticed. By this, it showed us the bitter crookedness and incompetence that is found in the military hierarchy, not portraying the heroics- but the nastier side of war, though in our eyes the soldiers are definitely courageous not matter what the superiors think and what fate they shall receive and Kubrick portrays it greatly.In the plot the soldier's fates seem to play more second fiddle to the confrontation between the military's superiors of this judgement, while the downbeat ending is truly powerful and captures the true spirit of war. The film is beautifully shot and the score is overwhelming to a great extend. The look of the film (trenches and castles) is vividly rich in detail and as well quite horrifying in capturing the mood of war and the unpleasantness that the soldiers face from their superiors and not just their enemies.What you get from Kubrick is a compelling and touching piece of film art. This is no-action packed movie- but intense and thought-provoking dialogue and performances is what drives this film.",10,0,0,16 April 2005
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," 'They do get better'.
","Maybe because of nostalgia reasons, 'Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure' remains as one of my favourite bodacious comedies. It mixes creative time-travel shenanigans (love the cheesy computer effects) with enthusiastic slacker humour leaving no pretensions. Light-hearted and quite juvenile, but infectiously amusing with many quotable dialogues and very fitting performances by duo Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter as two slacker teenagers Bill and Ted who are more concerned forming their rock band, The Wyld Stallyns that they're flunking history big time. Now they must pass their final history report with an A+. As Ted's dad (played sternly by Hal Landon Jr.) threatens to send him to military school meaning the end of the band. However their guardian angel from the future, Rufus (the laid-back George Carlin) turns up with a time- travelling phone booth to help them ace their report by heading into the past to actually learn from history's influential figures. The support cast do shape up nicely in their iconic depictions; Terry Gamilleri (the pick of the lot as Napoleon), Dan Shor, Tony Steedman, Jane Wiedlin, Clifford David, Rober V. Barron, Al Leong and Rod Loomis. Also showing up is Bernie Casey as the history teacher. Its one-idea gimmick keeps in character and crafts out some enjoyable, goofy interactions of the iconic figures adapting to modern times. But in all it's the energetic chemistry of Reeves and Winter that make it a complete blast, duuuude. 'Gentlemen, I'm here to help you with your history report'.",8,0,0,20 March 2013
Beetlejuice," 'You're working with a professional here!'
","Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse, Betelge... dare I say it? Director Tim Burton would follow-up his directorial oddball debut ('PEE WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE') with another ambitious comedy, this time something very zany, grotesque and surreal in the shape of a riotous supernatural dark spoof. As a kid I grew up watching this film, hey, I even liked the cartoon series. So re-watching it again was a sheer delight. Something I would never tire of.Burton would bring his signature visual gothic flair and live-action cartoon mannerisms to enliven the shallow, dressed up lifestyles in 'BEETLEJUICE', but what really makes the feature is the very loose performance of Michael Keaton as Betelgeuse. Keaton is outstanding in bringing this outrageously rotten character to life, from being menacing, charming the ladies, or simply exorcising a wise-crack. He's truly a head-spin. While he provides a huge impact, the Beetlejuice character doesn't really get a whole lot of screen time, despite his importance to the plot's progression. It's measured in bursts, as his character is virtually a punch-line with legs. But with that in mind, I think it works because Burton never overplays his hand, which makes Keaton's conman persona effective than say overbearing. I don't know if Burton would do the same thing these days.Anyway the narrative was always about Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin's recently deceased young rural couple adapting to the afterlife, while at the same time doing their best to frighten the house's new city-folk occupants that have ideas of changing their new home to meet their own trendy needs. So in a last ditch effort to scare them off they seek help from a freelance bio-exorcist ghost known as Betelgeuse. The compulsive plotting won't surprise (even though Burton throws up an interesting view of the afterlife), but what stands out is the wonderful set-pieces (how can you not grove along to the dinner party sequence as The Banana Boat Song plays), eccentric practical effects (loved the clay-animation), inspired pastel set-designs and wrapping it all together is Danny Elfman's enchantingly whimsical music score. One colorful dimension after another, but even with its comic flourishes it still demonstrates a nasty wickedness.Add to that an amusing cast, peppered with character actors and zesty interplays. Davis and Baldwin were likably good. Jeffery Jones is enjoyably clueless and Catherine O'Hara makes a great ice queen. Winona Ryder is fittingly deadpan as the very aware gothic teenage daughter and Glen Shadix entertains as the family's psychic friend. Also showing up in a memorable part is Silva Sidney as an afterlife caseworker.'BEETLEJUICE' is a decorative haunted house fun ride and one of Burton's best.",9,0,0,30 June 2020
