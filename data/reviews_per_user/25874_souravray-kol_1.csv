Black Swan," Nina Sayers (Natalie P) is desperate to get the role of white/black swan and her insecurity turned him to become a split personality to be a perfect performer.
","The best performance of Natalie P. As every director want his/her actor/actress to feel deep into the character. As Nina Sayers (Natalie P) was so dedicated that she has grown a split personality. Darren Aronofsky has beautifully directed and portrait human character personality when they are so insecure. Darren Aronofsky is at his boldest heading up Black Swan. His depiction of Nina's struggles as she succumbs to growing pressures from her director, her mother, her rivals, her physical ailments, her personal need for a perfect performance.. it is intense, thrilling, exhausting, and truly gripping throughout. Part of what makes it work is that we are completely along for the ride with Nina. We see what she sees, we experience what she experiences, and sometimes it is truly distressing stuff. I rate this film 8/10.Sourav",10,2,6,2 January 2011
