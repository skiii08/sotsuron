The Blair Witch Project," Time is the Blair Witch's worst enemy.
","After it all dies down, I'm thinking how lucky I was not to have jumped to have scored this film when the tide of passion and hype was at it's highest.When it came out I guess I would have scored it alot higher. I've now watched it three times. The third time seemed so very, very long to be made sea-sick whilst watching three people I really wasn't made to care about run around like headless chickens and make me wish I could climb inside the film and slap some sense into them, or just sit them down and tell them to get a grip.If anyone asks me to watch it again I'll probably just stand in a corner.The sequel might stand the test of time better though.",6,0,2,25 August 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A fine start to a long journey.
","It's a unique scenario. It's a prequel distanced from the source by two more intervening films and 25 years (real time). A hard journey for any small film to make. But with expert tuition and a handsome fan base before during and after conception it's proved to have weathered the storm admirably.In time we may come to call it 'The introductory one', or 'The one to show to the boy when he's nice and young, in order to get him into Star Wars at an early age'. By this I mean that it seems much more like a children's story than it's sequels do.I've a daughter aged 8 months and I'm already working out when she'll get to really sink her teeth into it. This is by no means meant in a bad way. The simple elegance of a narrative meant for children is very fashionable right now (see Harry Potter etc) and rightly so.I watched Star Wars IV when I was 7 and I was 7 again when I sat in the cinema last year, and on the sofa last night. Bliss...However I find two faults:Jar-Jar can be left out of any further adventures. & Darth Maul was the better fighter. By far.Oh yeah and the props were superb (this comment has nothing to do with my brother in law having worked on them).",7,0,0,25 August 2000
Stripes," Still a good film
","I just watched this film again last night after not having seen it for many, many years.It's still a remarkably funny film. The plot IS shoddy; The characters ARE thin: But the film IS very funny.If you haven't seen it for a while, hire it out and have a laugh.",7,0,0,29 August 2000
