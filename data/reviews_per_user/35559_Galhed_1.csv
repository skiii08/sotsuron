Casablanca," Casablanca - a boring film
","I heard, it was a good film that I have to see. So I watched the film - and I was disappointed. Okay, I didn't like such films very much, but this was one of the most boring films I've ever seen!!! It's a film with no thrilling moments and no interesting story. I waited and waited for a situation that wasn't easy to foresee, without luck. The happiest moment for me was the moment the film ended. Hey guys, this is a classic film, the only reason to watch it!",2,19,52,28 July 1999
