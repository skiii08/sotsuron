3:10 to Yuma," Surprisingly Good Western
","I was shocked by how much I liked this film. I have to say, I saw it mostly because it had big names; well, that and my fianc√© wanted to see a 'man' movie. But he and I both were doubtful because of the movie's western theme. Neither of us had seen the original, and we went in with our eyes wide open. I was completely enthralled from beginning to end! The acting (ironically, the two main characters are not played by Americans) was superb, the screenplay was brilliant, and the directing was amazing. Christian Bale and Russell Crowe nailed the 'western' accents and demeanor. The story moved at a steady pace and had good 'ol cow-boy music to back it up! I was most impressed by the directing. This was a small scale masterpiece in film directing! Of course, I immediately called some fellow movie-goers and heartily recommended the film. I don't think an old-fashioned western could have been introduced to a modern-day society in a better way!",10,4,9,12 September 2007
