Captain Phillips," An engaging tale of survival, based on a real incident!
","Captain Phillips is one of those intelligent yet simple thrillers, which without much gunpowder or even brains, get you hooked in just a few minutes. Such films are a rarity these days. But there is more to it than just a survival thriller.Captain Richard Phillips is a merchant merchant mariner, whose ship is hijacked by 4 Somali pirates. Captain Phillips unsuccessfully tries to negotiate but end up being a hostage.Global capitalization is a topic which hasn't been brought up in many movies. As I said, Phillips is not just a survival tale but it questions the effects of global capitalization, and the countries' drive and greed for power and control. Countries like Somali try to survive the death race started by other superpowers.The story not only lets you feel what Rich is feeling, but also the pirates' perspective. Which makes us wonder, where they really bad? Why won't they just give them the money? Muse's character is so intelligently crafted that the viewer only empathizes as much as Greengrass wants him to. Barkhad Abdi compliments this by a splendid acting performance.This film is the perfect example of 'acting with expressions and eyes'. Tom and Barkhad, compliment each others' performances throughout the film, and their eyes do the talking. Tom really outdid himself by portraying a shocked and traumatized captain at the end. It is very disappointing that he didn't get nominated, but I guess it was due to competition, all the nominations for best actor are simply marvelous. I guess its time the academy needs to extend the number of nominees for major categories other than best picture.Direction: Greengrass is great, a strong narrative and a strong hold on the film. He easily gets us hooked in just a few minutes. I haven't seen any of his previous works as of yet, thus the hand held camera really gave me a few headaches and dizziness, maybe it was done to give the viewer a more 'seasick' effect.Script/Story: Superbly written, minimal dialogues. A simple screenplay, but the film is more about expressions than dialogues.Acting: Tom is back, and he is at his best, he deserved a nomination. Barkhad Abdi was good for a newcomer with no experience whatsoever, though I don't see him wining the Oscar. Rest of the cast was equally good, especially the Somali actors.Music: The score had a striking resemblance to inception's score. I mistook the composer for Hans Zimmer, until I checked it. But further reading, I came to know that Zimmer was involved but remained uncredited. Nevertheless an amazing score, if not Oscar worthy.Overall a nail-biting and strong believable thriller. As it isn't a mind twister of a thriller it can easily be enjoyed when you want to rest your head after a long day of work.",7,0,1,31 January 2014
Gravity," The best Space movie!
","A superbly acted and directed space sci-fi thriller!! Visually a stunning extravaganza with Sandra Bullocks superb acting and Emmanuel Lubezki spectacular cinematography. The critics are right, it is probably the best film this year and actually a '2001: Space Odyssey of the new millennium.Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is stuck with veteran astronaut (Matt Kowalski) after being hit by a space disaster.Have you ever wondered what space is like? what it is like to be in zero gravity? etc. All the answers lie in a viewing of this film, preferably on an IMAX screen. The only regret I have is that we don't have any IMAX here in India. Nevertheless this film is not just a film but an experience.Visually driven films tend to lack proper story telling and in many cases a proper story, and in almost all cases no remember able performance. But this film is different, as much as it relies upon its superior bench-marked visuals, it is a plot and character driven story. It might lack character development, but there was no need for it, though George Clooney's character is developed well enough, whereas Sandra bullock's crowning performance is probably her career best.Alfonso Cuar√≥n waited for the right technology which was delivered to it by Cameron's Avatar, and Alfonso implemented it to perfection by combining it with his 'long shots' compelling direction and calculative writing. Along with extraordinary visuals the film also features an excellent soundtrack, and it is my pick for the Academy awards this year. I was very disappointed when Emmanuel Lubezki was snubbed by the academy for the Tree of Life, but this year it is impossible to beat him :).Direction: Extraordinarily, compelling and top notch.Script/Screenplay: Calculative and Strong. Has just the right thrills and character development as deemed necessary. Nothing feels 'thrown inn' or 'forced' Acting: Sandra's best, probably an Oscar is on the way, if not for Cate. George was great as well.Music: A sure Oscar. An extremely excellent score and very very well executed.When the film ends, you want to see more, you feel like I wish it was 3 to 4 hours long. If you haven't seen this yet, better go and watch it till its in theaters, it is not a film meant to be downloaded by torrents or watched on DVD or even Blu Ray.",8,1,2,26 January 2014
American Hustle," Good, but certainly overrated.
","As many people mentioned, David's ways and mannerism of film making especially American Hustle does remind me of Martin, but I think there still is a long road ahead for him to be anywhere near him. Even though the film is well made, superbly directed, excellently acted and fairly well written, it still ends up being a boring film which only gets better for the last 30 to 40 minutes.Premises set upon the ABSCAM, it is a fictionalized account of how a FBI agent used small con artists to get the big fishes.Firstly, this isn't my Genre, I don't particularly like these kind of films. They might be good and well rated, but I still find them boring at points. So I wasn't expecting much. As David O Russell say, he only like characters and hates plots, it is fairly evident in this venture of his. The film is totally character driven with some excellent performances, whereas the plot seems a little messed up and haphazard especially in the first half. The comic moments were rare and only came with Jennifer.Along with excellent directing and acting, the film has eye catchy costumes and hairstyling, particularly Amy's dresses and Lawrence's hair. I was surprised when it wasn't nominated for Makeup and Hairstyling. I think the film is the most deserving nominee for Costumes.Direction: Strong. David manages to hold a messy plot together.Writing: Slightly weak for David's standards. Though it is good towards the end.Acting: Almost everyone was outstanding, and I'd be utterly disappointed if Lupita takes away Lawrence's Statue.Music: A good mash-up of old classics.Overall a one time watch flick, well made, yet a bit boring. 6.7/10.",6,2,3,27 January 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Probably the best adapted movie ever!
","Years ago when I first saw this film, that too without any knowledge of the plot and without reading the books, I expected it to be a normal fantasy franchise with loads of CGI. But when I actually watched it, I was hooked to my seat and completed the 11 and a half hour trilogy in one sitting (Extended edition, mind it!). It is a kind of the movie that needs to be re watched time and again to be understood completely. I was so influenced with the films that I started reading about various characters on the internet and finally decided to read the books including the Hobbit. And then I realized how well adapted this franchise really is!!.The story begins with the introduction of the war of Sauron and the forging of all rings. The one ring which was thought to be lost is rediscovered and the Dark Lord rises again to re claim his lost treasure. An unlikely fellowship is formed to go on an unlikely never before held quest.Many critics criticize the length of the film, but after actually reading the books, one realizes it couldn't have been shorter. After every viewing it discloses something new, some references that were previously unnoticed and are a delight for the the book readers. Like the references to Smaug at the start, the undying lands Valor etc. The list goes on and on.It fairs even better as a stand alone film. If Tolkien was alive, Jackson's vision of middle earth and its characters certainly would have made him proud. With some excellent sets, locations and character designs and visual effects including sound and original score, it was probably the best film on a technical front in years. Each character constructed with minutest of detail. The Balrog managed to strike fear in the viewers eyes as much as it did to Gandalf The Grey. The fair Elves who are the most beautiful creatures on middle earth. The film has some extremely good cinematography.As the story itself is more of a adventure, thus it lacks character development and is less of a character driven story but more of an event driven. Also, there are many character so one can't focus on each of them for all the time. But traces are there in Gandalf's, Sam's or Gimili's characters which have been developed quite a bit. Ian portrays an awesome performance and he is 'Gandalf'.Direction: Excellent and flawless.Story/Screenplay: Couldn't have been better. Extraordinarily awesome.Acting: Ian was best, Sean was good. Others were convincing.Music: One of the best musical scores ever. It is haunting when it has to be, charming when it needs to be and fitting all the time. Shore has done an excellent job creating the score and incorporating it with chants which have a 'mythological' feel to them, just splendid.Probably the best possible start to an extraordinary trilogy.",10,0,0,15 January 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," An ordinary story with some extraordinary performances.
","If not years best film, it certainly had years' best performances, namely Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto. The story however, at least for me seemed a little far fetched and clich√©d at times.Ron, a rodeo is diagnosed with HIV. In order to live longer, he tries every possible medicine he can come across. When he finds few non-approved medicines to be effective in keeping him alive, he plans to make money through those. But in turn ends up helping numerous AIDS patients across Dallas.I had certain problems with the films, like it was a little cause of concern for me as to why he never ran out on his stock of medicines even if he was raided by the FDA (I might have missed something!). Also, the way he gets those medicines so easily smuggled inside the US is suspicious.Barring the problems there were a ton of pros of this feature. First the characters: The characters of DCB are so strongly penned the they end up sticking with you, especially Jared Leto's character. It might even change homophobics' perspective of transsexual and homosexuals, just like it did for Ron. While Ron may not be the typical happy go lucky type of AIDS character, he certainly is a memorable one. You might feel bad for Ron but at the same time you will hate him for his mannerism and behavior. You might acknowledge and understand his will to live, but at the same you will question his methods. In short, Ron does not need your empathy, he is far too great for that.The film breaks the traditional 'trust your doctor' approach of patients, specifically those who are sure of their impending death. It inspires us to fight and live, in a way we haven't seen before. Of all the AIDS movies we see, there is just one message, 'life is short, live it to the fullest'. But DCB not only gives this message but also has a new and a more prominent one 'Dare to live'. Live your life to the fullest and live long, whatever it takes.Direction: Jean-Marc Vall√©e manages to have a strong hold on the characters as well as the story, he is precise and shows us what we need to see, but not what we want.Script/Story: Excellently written with some memorable characters.Acting: Matthew McConaughey easily gives the best performance this year. He certainly will give Chiwetel Ejiofor a run for his money at the academy awards. I won't be surprise if it ends up with a tie. Jared Leto, the actor turned singer is easily mistaken as a singer turned actor, if you know what I mean. Probably the best and most heart wrenching performance in his career. An Oscar is a surety. Jennifer Garner and others are convincing.Music: The score was average, but well executed, given the small budget.Overall a nice and a different film. Not the traditional AIDS film, memorable nevertheless.",6,3,4,3 February 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Better as a standalone film.
","Many have rightly criticized the new Hobbit series as not staying true to the book. Where The Lord of the Rings trilogy excelled in its powerful and 'close to the source' narration, rather a visualization of the book with minute changes for the greater good, this Hobbit series is reduced to a plagiarized version of the children's novel. But critics and fans in general tend to ignore the fact that this is Jakson's Hobbit and not Tolkien's Hobbit. Thus one it is better to watch this film free from expectations and clearing yourself off the book.The story continues with Bilbo's actual role defined and the companies descend to Mirkwood. After escaping there they manage to reach the mountain and face the Dragon.As I mentioned earlier and many critics before me, there are many deviations from the book. Like the introduction of Legolas and Tauriel, The company facing off the Dragon and continuation of Azog. Where introduction of an intelligent Orc, Azog was hard to except it was nice to see Legolas and Tauriel, as it provides further character development to a previously highly developed character of Legolas, whereas Tauriel seemed unnecessary but acceptable, as one might interpret Tauriel's acceptance of a Dwarf was a consideration factor for further Legolas's acceptation of Gimili. Gandalf facing Sauron isn't actually an addition by Jackson, it did happen but behind the scenes, it was good to see it incorporated in the movie. Also I feel for some one new to middle earth, if they start watching the franchise in its actual chronological order, he will actually enjoy the LotR more.However, the sequence of the company facing the Dragon is simply destruction of continuity, done only for the purpose of showing the enthralling visual effects and the best ever movie dragon. Battling the dragon, totally destroys the purpose of appointment of Bilbo to the company, and the journey as a whole. Even if this movie wasn't based on a book that scene seems totally illogical and forced.The film provides a spectacular visual journey and probably the best made for movies dragon, which certainly will be remembered for long. The film has some good action scenes, well choreographed and flawless. Whereas, the film seems elongated all of the same. It could have been cut about 20 minutes easily. Simultaneously few scenes seemed rushed. What was missing was the character development, which was almost negligible. But fast paced adventure and action sequences make up for it. Excellent cinematography and sound design. Set decoration and production design are top notch as always. Makeup artists however seemed a little lackluster. Good costumes.Direction: Good. Strong enough to keep the viewer thrilled and and hungry.Screenplay/Story: If you compare it to the book, it's a let down, as a standalone venture it is just above average, as it is more of action driven than character driven.Acting: Martin Freeman is good, but there ain't much of him. Rest of the cast is average.Music: Average. Not as good as the previous ventures.Overall, if you rate it according to the book, I'd give a 6/10. But, as a standalone venture its a generous 9/10.",7,1,4,4 January 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Gollum, Gollum!!
","Rarely it is seen that sequels manage to keep up to the originals, generally heavily criticized by the fans of the original. But The Two Towers is a gem of a film and a jewel of a sequel. Nor does it go astray, neither it looses its pace. It is as beautiful as the The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship of The Ring. Also as beautiful as the book itself.Frodo and Sam continue with their quest and are finally united with Gollum, meanwhile Merry and Pippin finally get to play their part in the war. Aragorn and others fight to protect the Rohirrims from the armies of Sauruman's Uruk High.Just like the fellowship of the ring this film excels in breathtaking Cinematography, sound, original score, make up, set designs and visual effects. Also the character design, creating a haunting and pitiful Gollum, straight out of the book, I wonder if Tolkien actually wanted Gollum to be like that? Also It's superbly digitally acted by Andy Serkis, who reaches new heights of digital acting.The film also has some superior character development as it further sketches the characters of previously Un-scketched characters like Frodo, Aragorn and too some extent Legolas. Eoweyn brings in a good deal of famine element in the movie. According to the book, Ents are the most sluggish or boring creatures in the middle earth, and Jackson made sure to make their parts 'boring' (A little tongue in cheek).Direction: Flawless as before.Script/Screenplay: Strong and superb.Acting: I feel sad the Andy wasn't nominated in any major award ceremony, he was superb. Elijah shines too. Others are convincing.Music: Extremely good, though not as good as the Fellowship but still great and haunting. Its a delight to see how Gollum's last scene blends into Gollum's Song.Overall, not a movie but an experience.",10,0,2,16 January 2014
Life Is Beautiful," Innocence and Courage!!
","Innocence and courage, sometimes that's what you need to get through some hard times, more importantly, get the one you love through, have a shoulder for them when they need it. It's about love and family.It's the story of a father who uses his humor and his son's innocence to help him get through the Jewish Holocaust. He makes his son believe that it is all part of a game and the winner wins a tank.The first half of the film is actually a rom-com set in the politically strained environment of Italy. Whereas, the second half is set in the concentration camp where Guido tries to protect his son.Critics argue that the film handles a delicate subject matter in a comedic and carefree manner and it might offend a group of people. But it should be understood that that is actually the purpose of the film. What the character of Guido does is present the whole concentration camp as a part of a game to his son, and the viewer. If the actual holocaust was show, it would defy the purpose of the film and take away its innocence. We have Schindler's List for people who want to witness the actual holocaust. This is a different film. It is supposed to depict family love at its best. The film is about optimism and hope.The film being comedic, which manages to bring a smile every now and then, is depressing all of the same. Not only Benigni delivers a superb performance, he has directed it just as well. Barring the occasional goofs by the supporting cast here and there, it's the story that ill stay for you for a long time. The film is perfectly blended with just the right score and beautiful use of 'Belle nuit, √¥ nuit d'amour'.Direction: Strong self direction, might be a little flawed at places but great nevertheless.Screenplay/Story: Extremely good. It handles the controversial and delicate subject matter with utmost ease and delicacy. Strong character development, creates a character that stays with you. Even better executed.Acting: A deserving Oscar for Roberto Benigni. Giorgio Cantarini had the innate innocence required for the character. Rest if the cast was fitting.Music: 'Perfection in simplicity' is the most fitting phrase to describe the subtle score by Nicola Piovani.All in all, a film that stays. A film that can effect you if not change you. A film to be enjoyed with the family.",9,2,3,4 January 2014
12 Years a Slave," The best of it's genre!
","A lot of films are being made about slavery now a days. Just last year we had Lincoln and Django, this year we had The Butler and so on. This movie can rightly be called close to a Schindler's List to slavery in America.Solomon Northup is a free black man who is kidnapped and sold into slavery, hence he realizes the hardships and cruelty faced by the slaves and continues his struggle of survival.Just the thought of what Solomon or the people like him would have faced, like surviving year on year in absolute terror and not knowing what became of your family, just brings some chills to the spine. So a delicate topic handled with utmost care and ease by Steve McQueen and his talented cast. Just like Schindler's List, the film is pretty hard to watch as it says true to the slave stained era of America. From 5 minutes long lashing to the gory aftermath, there is truth in every scene.Proper time has been given to each scene, which is Mcqueens' trademark, it brings about the hidden talent in Chiwetel Ejiofor, a worthy Oscar Nod. The film is also good on technical front with some nice cinematography, editing and costumes. Great character development, one feels what Solomon feels. Particularly when he tries to console Elizia and When he realizes he can't do nothing for Patsy. The conflict faced buy the character is strongly depicted and can be felt by the viewer.Direction: Powerful direction and narrative, a worthy Oscar nod.Script/Screenplay: A perfectly written piece, which stays true to its content and source. Very easily it grips you to your seat.Acting: Chiwetel was absolutely awesome, scene by scene you feel what he feels, for a long time people are going to know him by 'Solomon'. Lupita is good, but an Oscar nod came to me as a surprise. Micheal certainly deserves a win, he was just marvelous.Music: I am very very disappointed at Hans not being nominated for the original score, it was the soul of the film, another snub.Even though it was an excellent film and I'm almost sure it will win the Best picture Oscar, I still feel it isn't the best of the year. I think Gravity was better. I haven't seen the others, but I'll soon catch up and I will be eligible to comment on the topic. Anyways a great film.",7,2,4,18 January 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," An honest adaptation of an honest account of a dishonest person!
","As much as I enjoyed this film, which is a typical Scorsese Crime drama with a many situational laughs, I found it a bit overrated as far as the award season and critics are being concerned. Yes! it is a great and well made film, but yet it has its flaws. The film induces scenes where you are forced to laugh, at the same time there are scenes which will keep you checking the clock.Jordan Belfort's story is a rags to riches saga by means which are 'not strictly speaking legal'. With more money comes greed, lust and drugs.To be honest, before the film I had no idea who Jordan Belfort was, so it was quite fascinating getting to know a new persona and a new scam. This year already had a similar genre movie, namely American hustle, which was certainly not better than The Wolf of Wall Street. But just like American Hustle the film had some extraordinary performances. Leo as usual, he badly wants an Oscar, he is willing to do anything for it, so it seems. Jonah is excellent, even the rest of the cast is great.As Scorsese said, if this was just a 'Crime-drama' it would have been a 3 hour torture, so it was necessary to make it a comedy, which was a pretty good decision. Many people argue that the film could have been easily cut shot to 2 or 2 and half hours, but I disagree. Yes there are a few boring scenes, but those are essential for character as well as plot development. Only a few dialogues here and there could have been cut shot, i.e at max 5 to 7 minutes.As I was new to Belfort's boiler room investments, after the film I spent hours reading about him, from which I can conclude that this was actually an honest depiction of the fraudulent billionaire. Even though Jordan is supposed to be a bad guy, but due to the charisma created by his character (and Leo's jaw droppingly brilliant depiction of him), I can't help but like him. He even makes me wanna be a stock broker and to do whatever he did. As he said, 'Let me tell you something. There's no nobility in poverty. I've been a poor man, and I've been a rich man. And I choose rich every time. '.Direction: Typical stylized Scorsese direction. A good first person account of Belfort's life. The viewer sees the world from Belfort's eyes. Top Notch, if not Oscar worthy.Story/Screenplay: As I said, it remains true to the book as well as Jordan's life. Some witty writing and situational humor. Strong. Worth the Oscar nod given.Acting: Leo is just splendid. If the film was released in any other year, Leo would certainly had won himself his first Academy Award. But this year competition is tough, where Matthew McConaughey is the favourite and Chiwetel Ejiofor was certainly better. Thus he is only the third choice. Jonah Hill keeps improving himself as an actor. The time is near when he will earn himself a lead role nod. Rest of the cast is great too.Music: Great, fitting, perfect.Overall a good film, with some witty humor and great performances.",8,1,3,30 January 2014
Her," Alone yet not alone, Simple yet not simple!
","'What is love?', 'Who are we?', 'What's the meaning of our existence?', these are a few questions which haunt each and every living human in this world, no matter of what caste, what ethnicity, what sex, and in near future even 'Artificially intelligent beings'.Her tells the story of Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix), a loner who is trying to come in terms after a broken marriage. He purchases a newly launched OS, which is designed to learn and grow every second, and is not an OS but a consciousness.There are so many things about this film, so many things it taught me, so many feels that I can't just put it in a review. You have to see this film over and over again, its got everything. It's got an excellent and pure love story for romance fan, a pure drama for drama fans, a tinge of sweet comedy for comedy fans, a hint on 'The Singularity' for sci-fi fans, and awesome songs and music for musical fans.As much the film seems simple, it is more and more complex for a 'humans'' understanding, you need at least 2 views or more to completely understand the depth. The fact of the future we are leading towards is just a small part of it. The film is much more than that, much much more! Oh! I can just keep on writing and writing.It tells us about the purity in love by an infant, and as he grows complex, he starts doubting his own feelings and the growing unintentional selfishness. When you overgrow your partner, their aren't just differences, there's a gap, a wide gap which can't easily be filled and hence you end up ending the relationship. I can't just convey how much I can relate to Joaquin Phoenix's character and how much I want an OS just like Samantha.Apart from extremely path-breaking and original writing the film has some good Cinematography and production design. The future which isn't very far is created with perfection and as one would imagine it to be. Everything so simplified and smooth, high waste pants and everyone so indulged in themselves. The film features an extremely extremely extremely excellent score by the Canadian band Arcade Fire. It will certainly give Steven Price's Gravity a run for it's money.Another thing I'd like to mention is Scarlett Johansson. Boy! I never thought someone could voice act better than they do the screen act. I've watched so many anime and all, yet I never thought I'd be appreciating voice acting in my life time. Samantha, i.e. Scarlett Johansson completely changed my perspective of voice acting. She was just splendid. She was funny, charismatic, sweet, lovely, cheeky, understanding and sensual. She was just awesome.Direction: Simple, smooth, artistic camera work just captures the characters so well that you actually find yourself in the world created by Jonze's imagination.Story/Screenplay: Do I have to say anything? An Oscar is a surety with no doubt at all. The best script in years. Actually the best film in years.Acting: It's time the snubbing Academy should re think their rules and policy. Not only do they need to increase the number of nominees in case their are more than five worthies in a year, they need to nominate voice acting as well. Well I remember, The Red Balloon winning a best screenplay without any dialogues, so why not nominate Scarlett for her performance even though she does not appear in the film. Meanwhile, Joaquin was just superb and at lest should have been nominated. I understand that the competition this year is tough, but he should have been nominated. Amy Adams was also good and fitting.Music: Probably the best score this year, I wish it ties with Gravity. I can't express my joy of seeing 'The moon Song' being nominated. I keep humming the song every minute. Just superb.Well, I can go on writing, but I have to finish it so, I'd just say that this was the best film of 2013, probably of last few years, and also one of the most original film I've ever seen.",9,0,2,4 February 2014
