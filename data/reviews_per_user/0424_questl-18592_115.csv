Ford v Ferrari," FvF
","Part of me wonders if I have stronger connection, a deeper investment to this film and the material as a born and raised Michigander that grew up immersed in automotive culture despite never really being a car person. Ford isn't just some company, it was a cornerstone of our economy and even our cultural identity. I say this because I got a legitimate rush out of this movie and when Ford is battling Ferrari I find myself wanting to get up and cheer them on.Furthermore, Bale and Damon should be in more movies together. The chemistry and the performances they deliver are exceptional. That's not to say the rest of the cast isn't pulling their weight, there are good, convincing performances all around, which does wonders for the immersion into this story.Also aiding in the immersion is the cinematography. Auto racing bores me in the real world and yet while watching this movie I found myself gripping the arm rests around the hairpin turns. As far as I'm concerned, that's an achievement of this movie, that it really draws me into what's going on.The only real drawback is in the 'villain' who, at times is just extra awful. Aside from that though, I loved this. Definitely recommend it and, more than that, I absolutely think it's worth seeing in theaters for the full experience.",9,3,6,23 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars I
","Going back and revisiting these is a fascinating experience. I, like most, despised this movie. Heralding it as the blight of a once glorious franchise.Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not about to advocate for this being a good movie, but its not that bad. There are definitely problems here but I can see what Lucas was aiming for, he just got a little lost in the weeds. Still, it looks great, there are some incredible lightsaber battles and pod racing is kinda fun.The problem to me is more with how wildly disconnected this feels from even the other prequels. Anakin aging so drastically while everyone else stays the same is a huge problem later on. But here, in just this, it kinda works.Jar Jar never worked. Even in this he annoys me to death. Definitely some bad here, it's not great, but it's not some crime against fandom either.",5,0,0,8 February 2020
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Wallflowered
","I really love the idea of this movie. Exploring the psyche of an introverted young man trying to navigate the social minefield of high school while struggling with his own baggage seems like a near timeless subject.It just didn't quite click fully for me. There's a plot movement at one point that I feel isn't entirely necessary to still have a compelling story but it was effective.This likely just needs another watch, maybe I was in the wrong headpiece or something. Problem is, this movie is a downer, so can't say I'm going to race to queue it up again. Still, whether I love it or not, I absolutely think this is worth watching.",6,0,0,4 April 2020
10 Cloverfield Lane," 10 Cloverfield Lane
","This movie upsets me. It's so great for around 90% of it yet there are little things here and there, but it's an exceptional movie all the same. Winstead and Goodman are incredible. The tension is palpable. And then the last 10 minutes comes along and sends this thing careening into a whole other genre and it just doesn't work for me.",7,0,0,8 October 2019
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Indy the First
","What's there left to say about Raiders? It's a perfect. Raiders is a movie that knows exactly what it is and just nails it from the opening scene. It's quotable, smart, funny, action packed and just an all around home run of a blockbuster.Anyone that hasn't seen this should give it a chance and everyone else should watch it again because it's so worth it.",10,0,0,28 April 2020
Resident Evil: Afterlife," RE:4
","The Resident Evil movies continue along they're steady decline. This one is even more ridiculous than the last, it creates nonsense, ignores previous lore and just sort of completely undercuts the whole drive of the previous film.Some of the monsters are cool, yes monsters because the notion that these are just zombies anymore, or vital reanimated corpses is long gone because there is no way some of theses things would happen through virus alone. Seriously, where are they get the weapons? Giant monster with giant axe/hammer thing is cool, but those aren't just laying around to be picked up.
Logic fails this movie. As much as I'd like to just turn my brain off and enjoy it, that doesn't happen. I can't get into it from moment one and while there are some fun moments, there's nothing holding it all together.",3,0,3,12 March 2020
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," WFRR
","This movie is deeply connected to my childhood and while it might not be perfect, each time I watch it I love it. As a child I appreciated the cartoon antics and now as an adult I find myself loving the discounting of grizzled, noir P.I. drama coupled with the zany cartoon wackiness with a slight commentary on the nature of social growth and development.I don't think it works for everyone, but it just sings for me and if it's somehow remained unseen, it's absolutely worth everyone and anyone giving it a try.",9,2,2,17 February 2020
Rocketman," Elton Egerton
","What a wonderful treat. Who would have thought that only a year after Bohemian Rhapsody Hollywood would strike gold again, this time with Elton John. Now, admittedly while I like Elton's music, I knew next to nothing about his life spi was very interested to see this. Even more so, I was interested to see if Kingsman was just a fluke or if Taron Egerton has legit talent.This portrayal of Elton's life was just as wild as the man and seemed perfectly fitting the legend's flair for the dramatic. The costumes were wild, the music was on point. The parents seemed a little extra awful, which was maybe true but they seemed almost too awful to be real.The music is the real standout here. Taron Egerton actually singing the songs was a risky gamble but it absolutely pays off. He completely embodies the musical icon and his renditions of the songs really help complete his transformation into Elton's tortured persona.It's the easy, obvious comparison but putting this up against Bohemian Rhapsody... I like Queen more and I loved Rami Malek's performance, but Egerton really goes the extra mile here and right now I'd give Rocketman the slight edge.Comparison aside, this is fantastic fun, fan or not and absolutely worth watching.",8,1,1,15 January 2020
Fight Club," Breaking the First Rule
","I have probably seen this at least a dozen times, but it's been years since my last viewing. As my appreciation of film has grown I worried this would wane in my mind but wow, so not the case. If anything the opposite is true.Every time I watch this I catch something new. So deep and so intricate is the craftsmanship and the message that even on repeat viewings there's something new to take away from it. The commentary it makes on society and our place in it is exceptional. It's ability to capture the state of ennui of the late '90s and somehow make that perpetually relevant even 20+ years later astounds me.Pitt and Norton booth give tremendous performances that to the charts of films I've seen them in. This is the movie that first made me develop a solid admiration for their respective talents. The style and artistry are most definitely Fincher and they fit perfectly here. I love the way he makes the city a character without ever needing to identify it. He fully trusts his audience in every respect and doesn't feel the need to spell things out or spoon feed us at any time.Yup, hard love on this one. Definitely an all time favorite for me. I still strongly recommend this to anyone that hasn't seen it and also heavily advise that people go into this without doing any research or digging. The less you know, the better. After all, the first rule of Fight Club...",10,0,0,25 March 2020
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Rogue1
","Hands down the best in this new generation of Star Wars movies. Rogue One steps back in time, slipping right in between episode III and IV, to witness the daring adventures and perilous gambit of the brave souls that captured the Death Star plans for the Rebellion.Our ragtag group of rebels is a mixed bag. The lead two, I actually feel pretty ambivalent on. They're not bad or anything but they don't exactly wore me either. Then you look at Alan Tudyk's hilarious, movie stealing, battle droid or Donnie Yen's remarkably universe expanding blind monk and I can't help but think they're some of the best Star Wars characters we've had in a long while (don't worry Kylo, you're in that list too).The film is fun, adventurous and fits quite nicely into the Star Wars universe, expanding on the lore without detracting a thing.The problem here is that it's still a Star Wars movie. As such, they just have to add a bunch of nods and callbacks to the other movies in really obvious and forced ways. Among these is a downright disturbing glimpse of a CGI rendered fan favorite that straight up creeps me out. If they could have dialed the fan service back a bit, this would have been an exceptional journey.Still, the ending is so amazing it makes up for a lot and we left with a movie that's a lot of fun, feels relevant and builds the universe. Definitely worth a watch.",7,1,2,10 February 2020
Coraline," Coralline
","Oh what a wonderfully dark and creepy film. This is the sort of kids movie that I miss from my childhood, the kind of movie that's not afraid to be dark and a little twisted. The stop motion is stunning, the characters are interesting and relatable with a villain that can deliver some serious chills.Most praiseworthy is this film's ability to evoke discussion. To demand dissection of the themes to discover a message that is pertinent and important. Absolutely worth the watch and a second watch and after you're done you might not look at buttons the same way ever again",9,1,1,2 September 2019
Passengers," Passengers
","It's beautiful, it's fun, it's got Pratt and Lawrence! Unfortunately it also has a habit of undercutting it's own emotional weight on a consistent basis by focusing on future tech spaceship porn rather than allowing things to steep long enough for decisions to really resonate. Not that it matters, because the ending does everything it can to further counteract the moral implications of the movie.The performances are still solid and the visuals are still stunning but instead of being a juicy steak to chew on, it's cotton candy. Superficial and sweet but not really satisfying.",5,0,0,28 August 2019
Zootopia," Zooland
","I know I'm in the minority here, but I just don't like this movie. The first time I watched it, it just annoyed me but I thought I'd give it a second chance, try and see what people love here. Still don't see it.On the upside, the animation is pretty. The voice acting is solid. There are even one or two moments of laughter.That's it though. The rest of this movie still falls apart to me. It feels too predictable and by the numbers. There's a message about equality which is nice but there's no subtlety to it, instead it gets hammered over your head again and again and again. There's no surprise here and I never feel invested in the characters or world. It's fun but not real deep.Maybe the most annoying thing to me is that I want to like this world and these characters and I just don't. It feels too much like Disney trying to jump on the equality bandwagon which, to me, ends up feeling empty, hollow and fake.Again, I know I'm the minority here and would still absolutely encourage people to check it out and form their own opinions.",4,1,1,13 January 2020
Shaun of the Dead," Shaun of the Dead
","Oh Edgar, you brilliant, brilliant man. Every time I go back to it I find something new, some new, subtle plot device or Easter egg. Not only is it the best zombie movie ever, it's hilarious and an exceptionally crafted film over all.",9,1,1,20 October 2019
Stripes," Stripes
","Stripes is a fun movie along the same stylings of Caddyshack and Ghostbusters. It doesn't quite live up to those for me but if you're a fan of these 80s comedies then this is likely going to be a fun time for you.It's worth checking out just for Murray, Ramis and Candy alone.",7,1,1,15 October 2019
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," CSL
","What a pleasant surprise this was. A charming, clever, fun exploration of the various forms of love that take place in the lives of our ensemble cast. Love isn't always, sweet, romantic and clean. Sometimes it's messy, complicated and people can fall out of it just as hard as they fall in.The latter part I really appreciated for the majority of this. Even aside from that though, everyone is doing such excellent work here that I found myself getting invested in most of the relationships.It does run into the problem that all movies like this seem to face though. Getting all of these divergent storylines to meet up takes a heavy dose of plot convenience to make work and I frankly never buy it. I also have some issues with the ending that I won't go into to avoid spoilers.Still, this is a fun little movie. It's a bit of a shame that it's been severely one-upped by better films (La La Land and Marriage Story cane to mind) but this is still a pleasantly enjoyable watch.",7,0,1,25 March 2020
Knives Out," Knives In
","Boasting a huge ensemble cast, more often than not, seems to be a recipe for disaster. All the buzz around this, raising expectations doesn't help either. There were a number of reasons for this to be a big studio swing and a whiff but they swung big and did they ever knock this out of the park.Knives Out is raw fun. Yes, the performances are great, perfectly fitting the over the top nature of the movie, with Evans really throwing some charisma around. Aside from that it's beautifully shot, well directed and the mystery actually makes sense and you believe the investigators are legitimately working things out rather than just knowing things because the plot demands it.The tone of this may be the biggest hang up some have with it. It's part legit whodunnit and part commentary on the genre. It ends up being to mysteries what Cabin in the Woods was to horror, a great example and indictment of the genre all in one If you have a hard time getting on that track, this one may miss at times. For me, the over the top moments were hilarious and it felt like that was intentional.Definitely a recommend, one of the best I've seen in theatre this year and one I can't wait to buy and watch again and again.",9,1,4,7 January 2020
The Irishman," The Irishmeh
","This movie frustrates me. I generally try to not take outside factors into a movie with me but between the anti-Marvel comments by Scorsese and the build up, the promises of an epic movie, sure to be an instant classic.Nope. This movie's boring.That seems to not be the popular consensus but oh well. The Irishman is 209 minutes. Three and a half hours of Scorsese's overindulgence. This could have easily been trimmed down to a solid three hours by focusing the story, maybe not having a dozen different, forgettable characters.The fact that it's yet another Scorsese mob movie doesn't help. I feel like I've seen this all before and in those instances I didn't have aging actors trying to act young during scenes where they obviously weren't physically up to the task. It just feels like a lot of really dragged out rehash.It might sound like I hated this but I didn't. De Niro andPacino are solid, not amazing or anything to me but they're good. RayRomano delivers a very enjoyable performance for the smaller role that he has. At the end of the day though, this movie is absolutely stolen by the return of Joe Pesci in a far more restrained, calculated but no less dangerous role that makes me really wish we'd gotten to see more of him in recent history.There are also a few scenes that are legitimately tense. Some events that are performed with shockingly brutal efficiency. Character moments that are fascinating.I've always been fascinated by the Hoffa story. He was a legendary figure whose demise has reached truly infamous levels. Trying to capture all of that is a lofty task and getting the likes of Scorsese, De Niro, Pacino and Pesci together sounds like it should be a home run. It just suffers from being too bland and drawn out for its own good. Part of me thinks I need to watch it again, but at three and a half hours, it will probably be a while before I feel like enduring this one again.",5,3,7,13 December 2019
Terminator Salvation," Terminator: This Franchise NEEDS Salvation
","I tried, I really did. Tried to watch this as just the movie and not let any other stuff interfere. It sorta worked. I had forgotten about Bale's epic meltdown until near the end. Couldn't forget the trailer though as for me this might go down as the biggest case of a trailer running a movie by giving WAY too much away.Trying to look beyond all that, this still feels like a mess, even if it's cool to actually live in a post Judgement Day world for a bit. There's just so many logistical problems with all of this that I struggle with.Still, it's alright enough, I guess. It leaves no lasting impression for good or bad. Perfectly mediocre action flick.",5,1,2,7 March 2020
Aquaman," The Bro-seidon Adventure
","Aquaman is the 5th outing for the DCEU and we'll... It sure is pretty.That's really all there is to Aquaman. All style, no substance. Visually, it's what I imagine a drug trip to look like. So many bright, swirling colors, vivid and vibrant.The biggest problem this movie has isn't actually its problem. It's the DCEU that it's forced to be a part of. The kaleidoscope of colors in Aquaman are stunning, but are a complete departure from the rest of the universe it's set in. Jason Mamoa is a fun guy to watch and has real potential as an action star but, Bro-seidon of Justice League still lingers in memory.Were this a stand alone film, it might rank higher for me. Sadly, that isn't the case and the crushing disappointment that is the greater DCEU weighs heavily on Atlantean shoulders.",6,2,2,12 September 2019
Deadpool 2," Captain Deadpool 2
","Sequels are tough. When I first saw this, I didn't think it quite lived up to the first but on rewatch that's flipped a bit. It's still a flawless Reynolds performance but now he has a solid supporting cast around him, a story that has some meat on it and, surprisingly some growth for the Merc with the Mouth. Still flawed, but so much fun.Also, much love for Domino and Cable here.",9,1,1,13 May 2020
X-Men," X-Men
","It was way back in 2008 when Iron Man first suited up and the Marvel Cinematic Universe caused an irrefutable shift in the cinematic landscape, for better or for worse.It's easy to forget that 8 years before Iron Man there were still solid Marvel movies. For it's time, X-Men is a really solid flick that, in a sense, prepared the way for The Avengers by telling a story while juggling numerous characters at once. Before Downey Jr embodied Tony Stark, Jackman had done the same thing with his portrayal of Wolverine. Before Killmonger or Thanos managed to steal a film through proper and engaging portrayals of villains, there was Magneto's, well, magnetism.It was all still in its infancy then and it lacked the polish and richness that would come later. There is some clunkiness, lightning toads come to mind, and there are a bunch of underused characters, poor Cyclops, but it's still a fun movie, even years later.",7,1,1,23 October 2019
Resident Evil: Extinction," RE:3
","Now these start to really go off the rails. From the opening narration where it says somehow this virus is drying up the oceans, cause that makes sense especially when I vaguely remember water being significant in a future film, to Alice now being a bonafide super hero. It really starts to feel like they're just making things up as they go in an effort to get some cool action scenes but none of it makes any sense at all.I really feel like these movies would be vastly improved by being less self-serious. If they would just embrace the ridiculous, B-movie nature of what they're doing, these could be a lot of fun but when they take it serious it just feels stupid.",4,0,3,10 March 2020
"I, Tonya"," She, Tonya
","This was a pleasant surprise. Margot Robbie once again proves she has exceptional talent as an actor and, in this one, they don't even have to rely on her beauty to accent her skills, it's just raw talent.Robbie isn't the only one giving an excellent performance though. Sebastian Stan is also going against type, losing his normally cool, tough guy act and slipping into the skin of a low brow and abusive spouse. Allison Janney is also remarkable as the tough loving mother that most of us have probably encountered at some point. Then there's PWH who I thought was just doing his normal slow hillbilly bit again until I saw the archive footage at the end and realized he was spot on in his performance.The story was compelling. I was a little young and disinterested in figure skating to really remember any of the details and can't begin to say how accurate it is, but as a character study it's fascinating. It also manages to film the actual skating in a way that's kinetic and heart pounding.That leads into a downside though. I understand that Robbie did her fair bit of the skating but she's not a figure skater and at times a stunt double was needed. The movie opts to scan Robbie'a head and plaster it over the double and it just looks off putting each and every time.Bad CG aside, this was a very entertaining and stylized movie that I really enjoyed and would absolutely recommend it for the performances alone. That and any movie that can make figure skating interesting to me is doing something very right.",8,1,1,22 February 2020
Moana," Moana
","On and behind the scenes, I love what Disney has done here. They've sourced voice talent that is legitimately Polynesian rather than the easy and oft used option. They created a princess story about a young woman working towards independence and self sufficiency with nary a love interest in sight. The music is beautiful, catchy and impactful. The movie makes me laugh, brings me to near tears and all the feels in between.I don't really even have negatives for this, aside from the stereotypical plot conveniences. Still, love this movie.",9,0,1,12 January 2020
BlacKkKlansman," BlacKkKlansman
","What a fun movie, irreverent but impactful, walking that thin line of making a point and making a joke so we'll until the very end.There's just so much here, so many layers, all so well portrayed. Like many movies with a strong message, it does tend to champion one side and demonize the other but, in this case... We'll, it's hard to make look real good.That said, whether intentional or not, there were some shots that really evokes a sense of how dangerous radicalism can be, regardless of what side it's on. There's a definite undertone here that goes beyond the normally portrayed tenants of racism and instead touches on a broader sense of equality, of trying to see things from another person's perspective which is endlessly important.That said, the last couple minutes forgoes the entire tone of the movie to try and show us what's still happening today but it's jarring in the worst way and doesn't fit at all. Remove the actual news footage and this is a better movie.",8,5,8,25 September 2019
Alien," Alien
","40 years after the fact and finally getting around to watching this movie and all I can think is that I wish I'd watched it earlier. The effects, for the most part, hold up very well, the acting is wonderful and the story is creative.Alien really is a testament to the glory of practical effects, because when the xenomorph jumps out it still looks amazing. Where the effects kinda falter is in the tech. Monitors and keyboards just look old in this.Unfortunately Alien suffers from something a lot of the greats do. If you're late to see it, 40 years late in this case, the film has so much invaded the pop culture consciousness that without ever seeing it you know some things. And, because it was so impactful, it's also influenced a wide number of things, which is incredible and adds to the significance of the film but makes it hard to watch now without feeling like these are things I've seen before.Still great movie and definitely worth the watch.",7,2,3,1 September 2019
Nacho Libre," Nacho Libre

Tangled," Tangled
","While not a perfect movie, the charm absolutely hits me and I love it. Mandy Moore is wonderful as Rapunzel, so wide eyed and full of life. Zachary Levi once again is hilarious and charming. The pair of them are so terribly likable. The music is fantastic. The whole movie is just great fun to me.",8,2,2,10 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Star Wars: The Fall of Skywalker
","I haven't loved the new trilogy movies so far. I'm in the 'Force Awakens is too much like New Hope' and 'Last Jedi is on the bad side of mediocre' camps. Still, I do love Star Wars and always hope to see something amazing when I go see one.So imagine my disappointment when I walk out of Skywalker just hating it. There are some fun visuals and some of the choreography is entertaining but aside from that I was more annoyed than anything.Won't go into detail and honestly I want to give it some time and another viewing to see if maybe today wasn't the right time for me to see it. But yeah, the whole thing felt like a bad fanfic script to me.",2,6,12,21 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Star Wars 2
","Continuing my re-visiting of the Star Wars films and yikes. If you watch these things sequentially, they get bad real fast. Attack of the Clones is a garbage fire of a movie filled with some of the worst stuff in any Star Wars film.It's really hard not to point the majority of the blame right at Hayden Christensen. The argument can always be made that he's just doing as directed and it's not really his fault and to an extent I agree with that. Christensen probably isn't the one that decided to have little Ani rapidly age and develop feelings for the seemingly ageless Padme, but he sure made it super duper creepy! His weird looks and stares are flat out unsettling at times like he's some Jedi sex offender. Anakin is central to this movie and absolutely everything about him is wrong.But wait, there's Yoda! When I first saw this I thought the Yoda fight scene was the best thing ever. Nooooot so much anymore. It's just weird. McGregor is doing fine work here though and his turn as Obi-Wan is one of the best, if not THE best thing about the prequels.Attack of the Clones also continues this need to be just goofy at times. Jar Jar is back and awful but beyond that there are huge action scenes and epic moments where they just have to wedge in some dumb gag.I so want to like these. Exploring the Star Wars universe and the birth of both Vader and the Empire should be a lot of fun. In this case, it's really not. The bad things are pervasive and problematic and they get everywhere. Just like sand.",3,2,3,8 February 2020
Corpse Bride," Corpse Bride
","Corpse Bride is a charming enough movie but it lacks flair. It's all very lukewarm. None of the songs really jumped out at me. The story is good, not great. The visuals are wonderful and the voice acting is impressive but that's not enough to drag it too high out of mediocrity for me.",6,1,2,2 November 2019
"Monsters, Inc."," Monsters!
","After 18 years, Monsters Inc still holds up, which is impressive for an animated film. The humor still lands, it's still adorable and fun. Boo is a little creepy looking now but aside from that holds up really well.The only thing really holding it back is that it doesn't seem to have a real strong message. Maybe I just missed it, but most Pixar movies have at least one significant message to them and in Monsters Inc I just wasn't getting the same depth to that.",7,0,0,6 October 2019
The Lost City of Z," The Lost City of Prime
","What a wonderful surprise treat. I had heard this was a good movie but beyond that and the fact that it's based on a true story, I knew next to nothing. Wonderful performances all around, obviously Hunnam is center stage here and he's great but I feel like Pattinson and, to an extent, Holland steal the show.A movie like this is hard to pull off, I feel. It would be so easy to add unnecessary spectacle, to turn the lead into a hero, to amp things up to 11 or shove in some Hollywood's stereotypes. It never stops to that though and instead we get a relatively even handed look at a flawed man with an obsession that dominates his life and the people around him that have to navigate it all.Unfortunately, I think it starts to flounder in the third act. The focus is gone and suddenly we're bouncing all over with sudden character movements that, maybe they're not completely unfounded but they feel rushed. It's as if they made it through the first two hours and suddenly remembered they needed an ending. That's probably unfair of me, because I do still really enjoy this but I couldn't help but notice how the slow, explorative tale suddenly switched gears.Still, it's an excellent movie. Is available on Prime, so it's highly accessible. Absolutely give it a shot if you have the chance.",8,0,0,19 March 2020
Captain America: The First Avenger," Cap 1
","I wasn't a fan of this one when it first came out. It was ok, real middle of the road stuff. Watching it again though and it's bumped up a little. There are a lot of great moments in this, moments that I still don't believe all coalesce into a great overall movie but there's some fun to be had. There are a number of montage that I don't love but it still all balances out to something above average.",6,0,0,21 March 2020
Bohemian Rhapsody," Queen: A Freddie Mercury Story
","Bohemian Rhapsody is a lot like a Cheeto puff. At first, when you're in the moment, it's amazing. Problem is, when the moment passes and it's dissolved to nothing you realize it's just air. There's no real substance to a cheese puff and there's not really any in this movie either.That said, I love Queen. A movie full of their amazing music? Yes please. Add to that the fact that the actors playing the band do a really solid job and that's even better and Rami Malek is an exceptional Freddie Mercury. Honestly, between this and Mr Robot, I want to see anything that Malek puts to film next.But then there's the other side of it. The 'villains' are so over the top, cartoon-like bad guys that it's ridiculous. The movie is practically a paint by numbers biopic, hitting all the overplayed notes even at the cost of accuracy to the actual events. Which, to me is a problem in and of itself. I'm not a super fan by any means but I have a passing knowledge of the Queen story, so there was really no hope of surprise here, making the formulaic approach all the more mundane.Still, did I mention I love Queen? I've watched this twice now and still get goosebumps at certain points just from the power of their music. It's like that Cheeto, I know there's nothing there. I know it won't fill me up or satisfy me. I know that.Still love it though.
Side Note: No behind the scenes of Under Pressure? Really movie? Come on. So disappointed in you.",7,2,3,30 December 2019
Burn After Reading," BAR
","What a fascinating movie. Honestly, it took me a second viewing to really feel like I got it but even after just once I knew there was something here. It's a story of paranoia, miscommunication and cosmic coincidence. In the hands of lesser directors this might feel nonsensical and too random but the Coens are skilled artisans when it comes to surreal, weird plot lines and story movements and it shows. Definitely worth a watch or two, if you're a fan of the Coen Brothers. It is definitely one of their movies after all and if you don't enjoy their style this might be rough.",8,2,2,12 November 2019
American Psycho," American Psychotic
","This is a poignant movie. A tale of stress and anxiety in the modern world, about the need to compete in our conformity all while struggling for some sort of recognition. The themes are really impressive and well delivered. Bale does a fine job, considering what I think he was directed to do. That's my biggest drawback to the movie though, there's a strong disconnect between what we see and the narration. It's definitely intentional and it mostly works it just isn't perfect to me.",7,1,1,13 November 2019
The Shining," The Shinning
","What a remarkable movie. The behind the scenes stories and the Easter eggs and the fan theories and the little flourishes and intricacies put into this are astounding. Each time I watch it I can sense both the slow burn tension as well as the artful and precise skill of Stanley Kubrick crafting something of a masterpiece.Still, it's not for everyone and in our modern culture there are definitely a few glaring signs of period racism and sexism that haven't aged super well, but I can hardly penalize a film for being from a less progressive point in time.At the end of the day, The Shining has, rightfully, reached legendary film status. So, if you've never seen it, or maybe it's just been a while, here's yet another voice amongst the masses to champion this film and confidently say it's worth watching.",9,1,1,19 November 2019
Dunkirk," Dunkirk
","For those that doubt the value of strong directors, I present: Dunkirk.Dunkirk is a war movie that is less about fighting and more about surviving. And after just watching it, that's about all the detail I've got.Unlike a typical Nolan film, Dunkirk doesn't seem to have interwoven plots within plots. It's basically just a war movie with a different perspective and that's not a bad thing. The plot is straight forward and the characters... I couldn't list a single one of their names right now for the life of me. Which is a bit of a problem because I don't find myself overly connecting with any of them.What it lacks in story though, it makes up for in the AV department. It looks wonderful, Nolan really has an eye for camerawork and framing that is hard to argue with. His decision to keep switching the aspect ratio up, adding and removing those 'widescreen' black bars, throughout the film was clearly purposeful but I found it distracting.The sound. Oh my lord the sound. I can't think of any other movie I've seen where the sound has impacted me so. It's not even the score, it's the effects. When a fighter passes overhead, I felt it. When a rifle fired, I could swear I felt the recoil. I don't know how he did it, but it was remarkable.Unfortunately, all the technical achievements don't completely make up for the 'meh' plot.",7,0,2,12 September 2019
The Lego Movie," LEGO!
","This movie is such a home run to me and such a surprise at the same time. A whole movie. About LEGO. Who would have thought that it would amount to anything. Yet, thanks to Lord & Miller, what we get is a gorgeously animated, brilliantly written and hilariously voiced movie that is both absurd and smart, comical and heartwarming.There is a moment, a single moment near the end that is a little... Tricky. The kind of thing that strains the reality of the world we're in. Still that's so minor that it doesn't hurt the overall experience.This is 100% a recommend for children and adults alike.",9,1,1,12 December 2019
Dallas Buyers Club," DBC
","This is one poignant film. Brilliantly acted by McConaughey and Leto especially. Seeing the journey these characters go on, especially McConaughey's transformation from selfish, homophobic jerk to a champion of a cause was moving. Seeing the way the system worked in a detrimental fashion for so many, forcing a few to work outside of regulations to acquire the treatment they desired.Potent and well performed. The film delivers well and would make for a marvelously somber pairing with Tom Hanks' Philadelphia. Absolutely worth watching.",8,0,1,4 January 2020
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Edgar Wright vs the World
","There is no other movie quite like Scott Pilgrim. It's like watching a comic book video game put to screen. The action is insane, over the top and super high energy with wonderfully creative framing and visual cues.Going back and watching it again, it's amazing how many people are in this before they were huge. Brie Larson, Chris Evans, Anna Kendrick just to name a few. The visuals still hold up, as does the pointed commentary on hipsters.Great music, great action, great performances. It's all around a fantastic experience. The only real downside to me is that it's based on something with a lot of content and in an effort to put a lot in here there are some moments that feel... Off. Areas where the graphic novel likely went into great detail yet the movie has to just sort of pop it in and run with it. These are mostly minor but it still prevents this from being absolutely perfect.",9,1,1,3 January 2020
Yesterday," The Other Day
","This was a wonderfully charming movie. A real love letter to the Beatles and, at the same time, a very sweet love story. It's well acted, it's funny.It also makes zero sense. Something happens and suddenly there's no Beatles, no Coca-Cola, no cigarettes and no explanations whatsoever. Now, not everything needs to be spelled out in movies but literally nothing is explained at all here and it's the central conceit of the movie. There's also this idea that suddenly injecting the Beatles into the modern climate would springboard someone from wannabe to music's Jesus, which I just don't think is realistic.What we're left with is a fun, charming movie... That doesn't even try to make any sense. It's definitely enjoyable, it feels like there could have been something more though. Definitely a recommend though if you can catch it streaming somewhere.",7,1,2,22 March 2020
Toy Story 4," TS4
","A long time ago, an unknown entity pitched the idea of a 100% computer generated film and we were graced with the OG Toy Story and the birth of Pixar. Over 20 years later and Pixar has become synonymous with exceptional animated films, all thanks to the success of the original Toy Story. With 24 years to grow and develop, what have they managed to do?Make the original look like utter garbage, for a start. Toy Story 4 is absolutely, undeniably gorgeous. In the opening scene alone they have managed to blow everything else away and they maintain that visual standard the whole way through. It once again proves that when it comes to animation beauty, Pixar is the bar.There is no shortage of good to be said about how this movie looks, both on the big screen and now on home video. The toys and the humans are stunning. The weather and environments are incredible. It really feels like a spectacular achievement.Beyond that, they've crafted a movie that checks a lot of boxes. Comedy, action, drama, heartwarming, romance and even, in a sense, horror are all present here and not just that, they're well represented.It's not all positive though and as I watch this a second time I find myself noticing things I didn't before. While the overall story is strong and raises very fascinating existential questions for the toys, there are things that don't quite hold up. Woody is center stage, and that's fine, but Buzz isn't just pushed back, his character inexplicably reverts into a gullible and even stupid representation of himself that has seemingly forgotten everything he learned in the previous films. And if Buzz is regressed, Jesse is all but forgotten through the majority of this.Speaking of the other films, I no longer understand the rules of this world. In all other instances, save one, when humans are around, the toys become inert. That's not the case here, they are actively moving around with large swaths of people around them and NO ONE notices them. They even manage to directly interact with things without people able to tell they're even there.These are small things but I found them distracting as I watched it again and was less enveloped in how stunning it looks. As a result, my initial rating is dropping a little bit and while I originally thought this might be my new favorite in the series, it's now found itself dropping a spot or even two from that point.In the end, I never wanted this movie. The third ended so beautifully that I just wanted them to leave the toys alone as a fond memory I could look back on rather than risk tarnishing them. But, even with the faults, Toy Story 4 is a wonderful and beautiful addition to a great series and it deserves to be seen. Kudos, Pixar.",8,0,0,2 December 2019
Bridesmaids," The BM
","This seems to be often sited as one of the best modern female comedies, the movie that put a spotlight on a number of talented ladies.Watching it for the first time, I suppose I get it. It's doing something most female comedies aren't willing to do. It's crass, it's gross, it's vulgar. Things normally reserved for the fellas.There in lies the problem. It's all stuff I've seen before, just with a different gender. Sure, it's funny at times, but it's also slow and clunky in some moments. I will give it that I do like the more restrained but still crass McCarthy but this is Wiig's movie and she owns it from start to finish.It's fun, I admire it for what it's doing but I can't say it was an overwhelming success in my eyes. It was good. Just good.",6,0,0,24 March 2020
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," TAD v Evil
","Tucker and Dale is a wonderful counter-horror film. Think along the lines of Cabin in the Woods. It's a movie that takes the horror tropes and flips them on their head. It's graphic, funny, creepy and also has a message about judging books by their covers, which I enjoyed.If you're looking for a pure horror, slasher flick then this might disappoint you because while there are elements of that it most certainly isn't that movie.Still. Alan Tudyk. What more do you need to know it's worth a shot. The man is a treasure.",8,3,3,16 October 2019
It Follows," It Happened
","I'm starting to think horror just isn't my genre anymore. It Follows has an interesting concept, one I've not seen before, where the monster/killer targets someone through a preternatural STD. After the mark is passed to someone, the killer starts to tirelessly stalk them. It's slow but smart, which feels like a play on so many horror villains of old that would only ever walk menacingly yet still catch their fleeing victims.Production-wise, this seems like it was made relatively cheaply. There's not really any special effects here but that's not to say there aren't effective shots. Given the premise, they don't really need any crazy CGI or a mass of Bay-esque explosions.The acting felt middling to poor, but honestly that's most horror movies to me. Also standard in horror movies, I feel like our main people are pretty stupid at times and if they'd actually thought about things, the killer is probably fairly easy to deal with.Again, the concept for this is interesting and new to me, and I always value new ideas. It's shot well. It's not acted terribly and is on par for the genre. By the end of the movie though when I was asked what I thought my instant reaction was a shrug followed by 'Its alright.' It just didn't grab me how I wanted it to.",6,0,0,2 January 2020

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Once Upon a Time...
","Oh Tarentino, just when I think I have you all figured out you go and make a film like this and completely surprise me. The sharp, clever dialogue, the fun twist on history and the gorgeous cinematography were all present but gone was the hyper violence and even the overblown profanity felt somehow tempered in this wonderful love letter to the old days of Hollywood.As one might expect from a Tarantino movie, it doesn't quite follow a typically chronological plot structure but he manages to weave things together excellently. In each scene of this meandering story, the actors play their roles to perfection with no noticeable performances bringing things down and it's the performances that carry this through because there isn't a standard plot to this one.This is the kind of film that demands to be mulled over, to really chew on it and then see it again and again. What more could anyone ask for?",8,11,18,26 August 2019
Gone Girl," Gone Girl
","For all those that look at Ben Affleck and still see him in the red spandex from Daredevil or detect the stench of Gigli lingering on him, give this one a try.The plot in this is pretty straight forward and if you can overlook some of the conveniences that almost always accompany a film like this then you're in for a solid suspense piece. But even if none of that works for you, the message this film has about our tendency to shoot first and ask questions later when it comes to character assassination is as relevant now as it's ever been.How about great acting? Affleck is stupendous. His ability to demonstrate a range of emotions while sprinkling in the occasional dry, hilarious witticism is perfectly done here. Neil Patrick Harris is spot on and so effectively defies his Barney-type performance to become something serious and even creepy is wonderful. And Tyler Perry, ladies and gentlemen! I've only known him from the Madea movie trailers, which are so not for me, but his limited role in this is spectacular, would love to see him like this in more movies.Definitely worth a watch and worth the conversations it elicits afterward.",7,1,1,11 September 2019
Aladdin," 'Laddin
","So far, I haven't enjoyed any of the Disney Live Action Remakes and this absolutely isn't going to change that. It's just unnecessary. It's the same movie, just without the perfect original cast, the cartoonish whimsy or the thinly veiled racism.Ok, that last one isn't a terrible thing to lose, and the cast isn't entirely awful. The new Aladdin and Jasmine do quite well, actually, they look the part and sound great. Jafar is ruined though. In the original, he was a manipulative, wicked yet smooth monster and in this he's just so sniveling and whiny. So not intimidating or fear inducing.Then there's Will Smith. Easily the biggest name here and, honestly probably one of the best contemporaries around that could play the genie. He's got swagger, a sense of humor and he's musical. I absolutely see why the studio would pick him. He's no Robin Williams though and frankly can't even compete, but he tries.My biggest issue with this movie, aside from the whole 'it's pointless to make a shot for shot remake of an existing classic' thing that bothers so many, myself included. No, my biggest issue is the anachronistic change to Jasmine. Disney goes out of their way to empower the character, which I'm all for Female empowerment but this movie takes place in like 8th Century in a Middle Eastern country. People still have their hands chopped off for pickpocketing here, as evidenced in one of the first songs. So while I'm totally on board with female empowerment, back then it really didn't feel realistic. Have her toss him out for lying to her or something rather than rewriting history.Anyhow, that just bugged me. Don't try to force modern ethics and sensibilities into a period piece movie. Of course the movie also features a genie, magic carpet and elephant monkey so... maybe I shouldn't take it so serious?",4,2,3,20 January 2020

","Bolt is a fun, harmless movie about a dog that's not quite as super as he thinks he is.

It's solid. Good even, but not great.",6,0,0,21 October 2019

The Lion King," The King of Offputting
","Disney has outdone themselves! For years now they've been regurgitating old stories and giving them the 'live-action' make over and for years I've been against it.On the upside, the technology developed here in order to create these near photo-realistic CGI animals is spectacular. This movie looks gorgeous. The voice talent is impressive as well.Exceptional visuals, strong voice talent and a classic story beloved by all, must be a home run, right?NOPE!The visuals turn out to be a tremendous hinderance. What was fun on cartoons turns out to be creepy and off putting on nearly lifelike animals. To their credit, they did try to tone down some of the crazier scenes but again, when the source material is so beloved, losing parts of it sting a little and seeing the exact same thing only not as good just... falls flat.Seriously, this is a weird experience. The stunning visuals really kill this, something I never thought I'd say. It's impossible to enjoy or get into a movie when every single scene is weird looking and takes the viewer out of the realism, severely magnifying all flaws along the way.If it weren't included with Disney+ and essentially free, I wouldn't recommend anyone watching this. Since it is readily available for basically nothing, it's worth checking out just for the technical achievement.",3,1,1,3 February 2020

","It's been over 15 years since The Incredibles was released and having just watched it all I can think is... WOW! Yes, compared to Incredibles 2, the visuals haven't all aged perfectly but given its age I can absolutely forgive that.What really blows me away is the depth, the layers of not just the story but the characters. Each time I watch this I feel like I'm keying in on something new and that amazes me.If you've somehow missed this one, go watch it. Now.",10,1,1,6 February 2020

","I really thought I'd like this movie more. I'd heard great things from enough people, superhero movies are my jam, especially when they take a different angle on the genre and the premise of this one is definitely fun.It just didn't quite land for me. That and the end really dragged me down. The world had been set up as pretty normal, seemingly, until the end when they introduce something that is completely world breaking to me. That and Cage's character came off as a lot creepy to me. Important to note, I thought Cage was actually pretty good and played exactly what he was meant to, his performance was great but the character itself is just a bit ew. I can only hear him being called Big Daddy by a little girl so many times before it's just weird.Anyhow, still an entertaining movie, it just shoots itself in the foot a bit, preventing it from being great.",6,1,2,3 November 2019

","I really didn't think I was going to like this movie. Maybe I've just seen the wrong ones but generally speaking movies with this kind of buzz annoy me with overly biased representations and a distinctive preaching tone to the message that just grates on me.Hidden Figures is not that movie.Yes, it has something to say and it says it but the story here is more than just that one note. There's heart, comedy and a quirkinesses to the characters that humanizes them and makes them enjoyable.There are one or two overly ignorant characters, but they feel like a minority and the cast at large is allowed to be natural, flawed and real.Definitely worth a watch.",7,0,2,25 September 2019
1917," 1917
","I LOVED this experience. I feel like experience is really the way to describe it too. The performances are great but this is so much more about the technical achievement. A 'one-shot' movie set amidst WWI and all the chaos that comes with it.What it manages to accomplish, as a 'one-shot' film, is a sense of immersion, tension and investment into these characters that is truly astounding. So impressive that, for the vast majority of the movie, didn't even know the characters' names, which really irritated me in Dunkirk but here I'm so sucked into this world that it doesn't matter.It also doesn't try to romanticize the war like some movies would. This is gritty and hard, a torturous and hellish landscape that scars everyone it touchesThere are a couple of minor issues I did have. Characters, soldiers that don't shoot when confronted by the enemy. That decide to inexplicably aid someone they never should. I'm sure this stuff happens but it felt a little more like a plot necessity than a character choice.I need to see this again. Walking out of the theater I was so stoked. The film has flaws and yet I find myself wanting to rave about it and give it the highest score possible. A second watch might knock it down a smidge but for right now, I'll happily love this one.",10,1,3,11 January 2020
Donnie Brasco," Wiseguys
","Thank you Brooklyn 99 for making me a little more aware of this one. This definitely wasn't what I was expecting though. I didn't look into this at all, went in cold, didn't even realize Depp was in it till he popped up on screen. Depp and Pacino do a fine job here and really convey the struggles these two characters through as they traverse the precarious world of the mob from opposing angles.Problem is, this starts off really clunky to me. There's so much exposition and explaining and characters that don't feel like they've fully developed or come together.Fortunately, once we get passed that opening speed bump, this gets very interesting. The relationships, the struggles, the psychology of it all is fascinating to watch. So much so that by the time we reach the crescendo it is absolutely riveting.If not for that opening, this would be stellar, but that opening act really drove me nuts. It also doesn't help that, in a lot of ways, The Departed is the same movie and it just did it better. It leaves Donnie Branco feeling above average and yet falling well short of what it could have been.",7,0,0,9 March 2020

There's some fun action, big monsters and the whole thing hasn't gone straight into ridiculousness yet.

How the once amazing graphics have aged and really don't hold up is the obvious thing but there's more than that.When I was younger, Sid was just the monster next door but watching it now I can't help but notice how the movie is (inadvertently) commenting on the impact parents have on their children. Andy's mom always being there, loving and supporting while Sid is literally blowing things up and his dad just sleeps in his recliner in a tucked away room.Then there's Woody, the cowboy that made us all fall in love with Pixar. To see him now... Woody is a jerk. He's self involved, selfish and even violent all because he's no longer the favorite.But that is the brilliance of Pixar. 19 years later, the visuals may have waned but the story complexities have matured like a fine wine proving that they have always understood how to make movies for children and adults alike.",8,1,1,28 September 2019
Midsommar," Midsommar
","I'm starting to think I'm just not on this director's wavelength. I hated Hereditary. I've been vehemently warned against the VVitch and as far as I'm concerned, Midsommar is terrible.This movie makes NO sense. Maybe I'm just missing it. Maybe it's all metaphor that I'm not connecting with. Maybe if I could understand all the un-subtitled Swedish I'd understand more. But, any movie I have to do research on just to understand it has failed on a fundamental level to convey its story in the allotted time.Beyond all that, the performances are awful. I didn't buy into any of the characters or the emotional journeys they went on. Florence Pugh is trying to give some emotion and at times full on heartbreak but all she really manages is a lot of ugly crying. Jack Reynor, the love interest, is as stiff as a board with all the personality of cardboard. He's supposed to be with this group for a reason but that barely even comes up until 2/3rds of the way through the movie, like they suddenly remembered, 'Oh yeah, he's supposed to have a story too.'The movie just made me mad.

","Don't Breathe is the story of a small gang of criminals with a proclivity for B&E who set their sights on the home of a blind man. They think the disabled vet will be an easy mark, that is until he turns the tables on them and the hunters become the hunted.God, if that was the movie I would have enjoyed it more. Instead we get the above with a twist. The poor, old, blind vet is actually a twisted sadist fond of torture and pseudo rape. So he's not exactly a sympathetic burglary victim.While they make the victim into a monster, they try to turn the criminals sympathetic. This shift in morality was likely meant to be compelling and norm-busting but instead it makes me long for what could have been, because there are interesting things here.

Watching the Disaster Artist without having seen The Room seems like it would be missing a lot. And, if you watch The Room and can't stand a minute more of this nut job on screen then The Disaster Artist is not going to work for you because James Franco perfectly becomes Tommy Wiseau.

","The Wolf of Wall Street is a film of indulgence, packed full with copious amounts of booze, drugs, language and sex. As all of that may suggest, the enjoyment of this film relies heavily on the frame of mind you're in when you watch it, more than most. You've got to be ready for debauchery and scandal, for characters that are so charismatic that you forget they're awful people and you hate yourself for liking them.If you're open to it, this is an incredible film, filled with exceptional performances , visuals, sound and just a general cornucopia of goodness. Overall I find it to be a wonderful romp and definitely worth the time. Just remember to keep it away from children and the more squimish or conservative adults.",8,0,1,3 October 2019
It Chapter Two," It Continues
","It Chapter Two, the follow up to It, picks up where the original left off. The kids have all grown up and the demon clown is back to terrorize them. Or has it?Chapter Two suffers from a bit of an identity problem. It's one part Poltergeist, legitimately tense and mind bending horror, and one part... Ghostbusters. Maybe it was just the theater I was in, but there were a surprising number of laughs in this movie. It also can't decide if it should focus on the adults or on the flashbacks with the kids.The flashbacks also directly lead into the films other main issue. The pacing is all off. The beginning and end or spot on but the middle definitely drags and I started to feel the 169 minute runtime of the movie.It's not all bad though. The performances are spot on, everyone fits their roles with no real outliers. That said, there are a couple that go above and beyond. James McAvoy and Bill Skarsgard are exceptional but everyone ends up being upstaged by Bill Hader who absolutely runs away with this one.Performances aside, the visuals are stunning. Penny wise is all about weird and twisted displays, so the visual effects have to be exceptional or the whole thing would fall apart and fortunately they deliver in every scene.In the end, it's a good, fun movie. It's far from flawless but it's got plenty of honest fun and strong emotions with legitimate tension to satisfy. Absolutely worth being seen on the big screen and will warrant future views as well.",7,1,2,9 September 2019
Stranger Than Fiction," STF
","Stranger Than Fiction reminds me quite a bit of The Truman Show. Take a comedic actor and drop them into a dramatic role that questions the nature of our reality in a really impressive way. I'm not normally a huge Will Ferrell fan but I thought he was great in this. The supporting cast is all excellent as well but this is absolutely Ferrell's movie. The way it intermingles the performances with the narrative conceit is well done and a lot of fun which, along with the visual flourishes, creates a wonderful and immersive experience worth watching.",8,1,1,18 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Star Wars 3
","The problems of Episode 2 return. The continuing story of the creation and transformation of Anakin into Darth Vader and yet the performances don't deliver on any of the promises of epic stories and grand adventure. Everything feels off and odd and manufactured.McGregor and Portman are doing all they can with the material they're given, but that's not a lot. Christensen is still stiff as a board with all the personality to match.Such a shame how quickly these prequels ran a great franchise into the ground. That said, the lightsaber battles are still quite excellent but there's really not a ton here too enjoy beyond the laughable bad.",3,1,3,9 February 2020
Murder on the Orient Express," MOTOE
","This is a genre I didn't even realized I missed but, this was such a fun ride. All the actors play their roles well with Kenneth Branagh really running away with it as Poirot along with a surprisingly non-comical turn from Josh Gad. The cinematography is stunning with numerous long shots and fun angles to draw you in.Despite all that, the ending wasn't as satisfying as I would have liked but still it was a very fun ride and definitely worth a watch.",7,1,5,21 September 2019
WALL·E," Waaaaaaaaall-E
","This movie is near perfection for me. What Pixar is able to do, the story it tells, the emotional journey it takes us on all with minimal dialogue is so impressive. That it can also layer in messages about environmentalism, our ever increasing reliance on technology, the shifting nature of social interaction moving away from face to face conversation to digital conveyances and the movie looks STUNNING while it does it.Oh yeah, and it came out over 10 years ago. Seriously, Wall-E is brilliant.",9,0,0,12 November 2019
Finding Dory," Holy Carp!
","I may be one of the few people out there that doesn't love Finding Nemo, it was ok but it didn't really do anything for me. So, going into Finding Dory I had no real expectations.First and foremost, it is GORGEOUS. The colors are striking, the blue tones of the water are realistic at times mesmerizing and the movements of the various creatures are realistic and fluid.Most importantly though is the story. Dory's journey is one of self discovery, of living with a disability and all of the hurdles that creates in your life. It's about the way it makes others look at you and how she overcomes that. Not with some miracle cure that instantly solves everything or erases the issue altogether in the end, but with honest to goodness character growth.As an aside, I had avoided seeing this one until I had finally seen Finding Nemo and while I would recommend seeing Nemo, Finding Dory does stand alone as it's own film.",9,5,6,1 September 2019
The Big Short," The Big Short
","Between this and Vice I'm starting to think I might be a big fan of Adam McKay. The way he jumps in and out of the movie, using the fourth wall breaks to tell story, sprinkling in self proclaimed false truths and intertwining it all with wit and a clear passion for the subject matter makes for uniquely entertaining pieces that may even be teaching a thing or two.The inverse is that his films so far have been entirely one sided and the Big Short definitely fits that bill. Still his ability to get great performances from people is exceptional and I'm looking forward to more",7,0,1,8 October 2019
Marriage Story," Divorce Story
","I feel like my reaction to this movie is unfair to what's actually been put to screen. I have heard numerous, respected voices on film saying how phenomenal this was and I think that got to me. I turned this on expecting a masterpiece and when it was all said and done all I could think was 'It's good, but not as good as everyone made it out to be.'The performances are all great. Driver and Johanssen together is just a recipe for success to me. The events all felt very real and believable. Everything about this was good. The parts are all solid and yet the sum of them all leaves me feeling underwhelmed.Definitely going to try revisiting this in the future to give it another chance but for now, it's still a good movie, just not the brilliant bit of filmmaking I'd expected.",7,4,6,10 January 2020
Iron Man," The Man in the Iron Suit
","This is pure fandom here for me. I loved the Iron Man comics growing up and to see it brought to the screen so well blew my mind. Downey Jr came out of nowhere and blew us all away as Tony Stark. It still looks great, it's still a blast to me. It's more than just a fun action movie though, it's hilarious, it explores a man coming to grips with his own legacy. It really is perfect to me, and I know I'm incapable of being unbiased about this one.Beyond all that, I can't overlook the impact this has, not just on superhero movies but on the entire film landscape. If Iron Man would have flopped we wouldn't be inundated with cinematic universe, expanded movie realms and more superheroes than we can shake a stick at. For better or worse, it changed things.Now, the sequels are definitely lesser, so my fandom isn't without limits, but this one just got everything right.",10,0,1,20 March 2020
Mother!," MOTHER!
","This is one of those movies that I absolutely love but can also absolutely understand people hating it. It's crazy, pure metaphors that makes no literal sense and I can fully appreciate why some people would not be into it. None of that 'you just don't get it' nonsense, this is just an abstract movie and that will either work with people or it won't.We follow Him and Her, otherwise unnamed characters as life seems to rapidly arrive on their doorstep in outrageous fashion.I do feel as though, whether the plot or narrative works, the performances are incredible. It's really a showcase for Lawrence and she's spectacular here but so is Bardem, with the tertiary characters doing well also.It's hard to really talk about it without having seen it but it's the kind of movie I just want to dive into, dissect and discuss. Absolutely love it.",10,2,6,27 February 2020
The Emperor's New Groove," TENG
","This is not a perfect movie by any means but even watching it now this just cracks me up. David Spade always gets me, the fourth wall breaking, the way it pokes fun at itself and other Disney movies. It all just works really well for me. I completely understand how it wouldn't click with everyone but I love it every time.",8,0,1,16 February 2020
Toy Story 3," TS3
","Of all the Toy Story movies, I think this is my favorite. I can't argue with the importance of 1 and what it did, I can't debate the stunning achievement that is 4 and all its visual splendor and 2 is there too.What 3 brings is heart. There are moments, no matter how many times I watch this, that make my eyes well up and really tug on the heartstrings. I have a stronger reaction to this than any of the others, hands down.Beyond that, the story here is powerful. A story of growing up and changing, about leaving behind the things of our youth and entering adulthood. About moving on when the things we idolize leave us behind.It's also hilarious, has a wonderful villain and just strikes it completely out of the park. I will say, I don't know that this works as a stand alone film so if you haven't seen 1 and 2 then catch them first but other than that, this is amazing.",9,0,1,26 February 2020
Space Jam," Jam On
","Nostalgia dies hard sometimes. I loved this movie when I was a kid. I wasn't even a basketball fan yet seeing Michael Jordan step into the world of Looney Toons for a goofy, cartoon game against alien Monstars? Oh that hit me just right.Watched this for the first time in a long time a couple days ago and, despite the fact that now I'm older and more critical, I can't deny that this transported me right back to when I was a kid.That being said, this movie is ridiculous. It makes no sense whatsoever and the second you stop to ask why or how it either falls apart or gives you a headache. The acting is not great, but at the same time, Jordan's not an actor and considering this movie has to be like 80% him just living in a green screen world, it's pretty impressive and I'll forgive him for not having all his eyelines down.I'd be really curious to see someone watch this now who didn't watch this as a kid. Like I said, nostalgia plays heavily with me on this and I know it. Seeing someone come to this fresh would be fascinating. Regardless, I'd almost say it's worth watching for that soundtrack alone!",7,0,0,8 March 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Jojo's Bizzare Adventure
","Hands down the funniest Hitler movie I've ever seen. This thing is bonkers, irreverent, crazy and yet somehow remarkably poignant and impactful. I would have never thought to laugh at outrageous Nazi-isms and be near tears in other moments. Everyone is spot on here but ScarJo really stood out to me, delivering a quirky yet lovingly maternal performance.It actually surprises me to see this is so highly rated because I would have thought this would be an incredibly divisive film. Apparently it found the sweet spot with audiences and I'm so happy about that. A definite must see.",9,3,6,3 February 2020
Midway," Mehway
","This movie is confused. It's an exploration of the conflict between American and Japanese forces in the Pacific from primarily the American perspective and yet the movie has nearly half of its budget coming from Chinese backers. I don't generally care where the money comes from on these movies but in this case I feel like it might have something to do with the confusion.We get a lot of time on both the American and Japanese sides of things with the Americans often treated like the clumsy buffoons who accidental themselves into victories while the Japanese have the superior force and skill yet suffer from sheer rotten luck. Which is maybe how it really happened, I don't pretend to know, but it doesn't film well.That alone wouldn't kill it, but clumsy plot movements don't help and neither does an unnecessary number of underdeveloped characters. Couple that with a firm jaunt into the uncanny valley with the effects and this movie is a mess. Too much of the budget must have gone to the cast and not to the finishing touches on the visuals because there are times planes are crashing into the ocean and it looks like an AR effect I could get on my phone.Weirdly, despite all of that, I didn't hate this movie, it just wasn't very good and a surprisingly disappointing theatre experience.",3,2,6,1 December 2019
A Night at the Roxbury," Rockin' the Roxbury
","This movie is so stupid. It knows it too and fully gives itself over to it. There are purposeful shots of people looking right at the camera. Ridiculous running gags. Main characters so dumb they would never survive real life. There's also a completely ridiculous story.Seriously, stupid movie. And I LOVE it! Might just be nostalgia from back when I first watched and enjoyed the high quotability. It hasn't aged well at all but I still love the ridiculousness of this.Also, seriously, how did Chris Kattan not have a bigger career? The guy always cracked me up.",7,0,0,3 January 2020

The Matrix," They Know Kung Fu
","I remember when this first came out. Everybody was talking about it, it dominated the discussions everywhere. Whether people understood it or not, people seemed to recognize the greatness of the existential cyberpunk kung fu mind bender.I loved it then and now watching it again for the first time in years that love changed but not waned. The layers, the metaphors, the symbolism, everything in this is spot on. The action is beyond reproach. So much so that it heavily impacted countless other films that followed it. It was a game changer, no denying it.Over twenty years later and this still absolutely holds up. There were a couple brief CGI moments that don't really look all that great today, but they don't detract from the movie and I'm not about to hold that against this.This is a huge recommend to anyone that managed to not see it. I'm not as down on the sequels as a lot of people are, but they definitely aren't on the same level and you could really just watch the first one on its own if you wanted to.",10,0,1,6 April 2020
Deadpool," Captain Deadpool
",What a marvelous example of a movie with a generic plot and super lame baddies being completely saved by a perfectly cast lead. Reynolds IS Deadpool in a way it feels like no one else could be. His embodiment of the character totally makes up for the flaws in this movie in a lot of ways. He doesn't completely wash away the issues but this is endlessly watchable if just for him.,8,0,1,13 May 2020
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Kingsman 1
","This movie is nuts. It's a hyper-stylized spy thriller doped up on steroids and a little LCD.It is soooooo much fun though. Parts of it are pure nonsense and if you stop to think about any of it realistically it falls apart but it's not trying to be Bond. Quite the contrary, a big part of this is spoofing on old spy flicks.Performances are all spot on, even Jackson's ridiculous lisp feels like it somehow fits in this crazy world. It's the action though that makes this. There are seems of raw heart pounding, edge of your seat, cheering them on as they take on the world moments that make me want to stand up and cheer them on and that is so rare for me.Again, bonkers movie but it knows exactly what it is and it nails it. Absolutely a good time.",8,0,0,10 January 2020
Cube," Cubed
","This such a stupid B movie. A group of people trapped inside some massive technological cube that, despite being enormous and requiring a fortune to build and tons of research and man hours to construct, it's still a secret. They do try to address that but come on. And let's not talk about how absurd it is to build this monstrosity just to torture and kill people. The acting is cheesy, there's one, maybe two sets their on the entire time. It's just ridiculous.If only I could figure out why I love it so much.",7,0,0,31 January 2020
Easy A," Easy... B+
","Easy A is a fun little movie about a girl's trip through the high school rumor mill. It's funny, it's well acted, it's filled with... A bunch of people playing high schoolers that are a little too old to actually fit the part.And that's what holds it back, because the message is important and the performances are solid and the humor did work for me... But.For everything that works there are little things that take away from it. Some of these 'kids' act the part, sure they're playing dialed up archetypes, but amidst them are also Rhodes Scholars, the most unrealistically awesome, scene stealing parents and the kind of teachers we all wish we had.So while a good chunk of this wants to live in reality, there's a significant enough portion that wants to live in a fantasy land and the two just don't merge into a perfect harmony.",7,1,1,16 September 2019
Annihilation," Annihi- Whaaaaaat?!
","From the brilliant mind behind Ex Machina comes Annihilation, the story of a biologist exploring an incredible phenomenon. Much like Ex Machina, this is a film that draws you in and, while it may seem like standard Sci-Fi fare, soon it draws you in and has you questioning everything.Great performances all around drive it from start to finish and exceptional effects really help visualize the phenomenon and the world around it.At the end, Annihilation is a movie that'll make you think. It practically demands that you question things, giving us enough but also leaving enough unsaid to invite plenty of discussion and any movie that can really get people talking earns bonus points with me.",8,2,4,25 September 2019
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Holy Grail
","I always feel like I'm one of the very few not in love with Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I've seen it a few times and just never have the uproarious laughter that everyone else seems to experience. Still, despite not loving it myself, I can certainly recognize that there is clever, pertinent and prescient commentary on the world. It's also impossible to ignore the pop cultural impact it's had. The movie is so quotable that there's a good chance a lot of people quote it without even having seen it and that's just impressive.",6,4,8,16 October 2019
Aladdin," The OG Aladdin
","Robin Williams as the genie is perfection. Don't get me wrong, the rest of this is great too but the genie is HIS role without contest. The only real negative I have for this movie is the early 90's racism that was pretty much just accepted back then but isn't cool now.It's Aladdin though. It's a classic. The only good thing about the live action one coming out is that maybe more people will go back and watch this.",9,0,0,2 February 2020
Sin City," Sin City
","A pulpy and slick noir film that's easy on the eyes and heavy with the blood. Sin City is fun, it's solidly acted and it's very artistically stylized. To me, possibly the best part though is the color. The way certain things are given color in this otherwise black and white world is a treat. It's also very much rated R for blood, violence, language and nudity so if that's a problem, this probably isn't for you.",7,0,0,20 November 2019
Gangs of New York," GoNY

Her," Her
","Wow. Just wow. What this film is able to accomplish, the emotion it attains and the characters it creates when so much of it comes from a disembodied voice is nothing short of astonishing. Not to mention the message the film brings to the table, a remarkably pertinent look at our ever-evolving connection with technology, the way interpersonal relationships are shifting.Joaquin Phoenix delivers a remarkable performance but is nearly overshadowed by the voice of Scarlett Johansson, who we never see, which is made even more impressive considering she wasn't the original actress and had to come in after the fact to record her part.An absolutely wonderful film, the only potential negative is that it can get a bit slow in parts but it is so worth it.",9,0,0,6 September 2019
Warcraft," Warcraft
","Warcraft is a fascinating movie. Mostly because the enjoyment of it seems to heavily rely on the connection you have with the source material.The first time I watched it, I'd never played the game and really knew nothing about that world. As a result, the movie was a mess that jumped from weird place to place filled with characters I knew nothing about and didn't particularly care for. Had I have rated it then, it would have hovered around a 3.After that first viewing I was eventually drawn into World of Warcraft and played quite a bit of it. When I saw the movie sitting on the shelf I figured I would give it another try and WoW! It was a completely different experience. Suddenly those characters felt so much more important. The weird locations weren't nonsensical anymore, in fact I knew exactly where they were relative to each other and how to get there. The entire world had become richer as I'd grown more connected to it.That seems to be the experience most people have with it too. If you're a fan of the game, this will probably be a fun experience for you. If not... I really wouldn't bother with it.",7,1,1,5 October 2019
Goodfellas," Good-Not-Greatfellas
","Another in a series of movies from my list of shame that I'm catching up on. I'd never seen this, but knew some of the famous lines, which is no surprise given the popularity and high status this movie has.Sadly, I grew up knowing Pesci from Home Alone and Gone Fishin' and My Cousin Vinny. I never caught him in these career defining roles. The man is terrifying with the intensity he brings. De Niro I knew from Meet the Parents and Stardust, I never got to experience the powerhouse performances. Ray Liotta.. I've seen him in stuff but he never made much impression on me. Aside from the big three, everyone in this is solid, there's no bad performances bringing it down.Sadly, I think this suffers because I've seen other gangster movies. This feels sooooo much like every other mob movie. A lower grade Godfather, a less stylish Pulp Fiction, not as epic as The Irishman, and not as The Departed, it doesn't even explore the taxing nature of these lives as well Donnie Brasco. Almost all of these follow a young man coming up in the mob, loving it at first and then suffering for it.What Goodfellas has gong for it is a collection of exceptional moments. The overall movie may feel oddly derivative to me but there's no doubt that some scenes are exceptional. It's definitely an odd experience because I know this predates almost all of those but that's not been my experience and it definitely suffers in my eyes because of it.",6,2,3,18 March 2020
Jurassic Park," The OG JP
","Jurassic Park is a classic and for good reason. Reshaping the blockbuster landscape along with Jaws and implementing practical effects that hold up exceptionally well even to today's standards. There's absolutely a lot to love here and a wonderful commentary about the dangers of the recklessly racing after scientific developments.There's nothing majorly wrong here to me, but on this most recent watch it just didn't resonate with me as much as some other things of late have, moving it down a slight bit in my eyes.",8,0,0,10 February 2020
Beetlejuice," It's Showtime!
","Over 30 years since this films release and it still astounds. The creativity, the humor, the performances, the darkness and the camp all add up to create something we just don't see these days. Beetlejuice is the kind of movie that would never get made today, it's too weird, too crazy and too original to make it to the big screen.All that said, this kind of film is likely to be divisive. It will either work for you or it won't. It'll be your kind of weird or it'll be way too out there or too campy. Regardless it's worth a shot. After all, Beetlejuice is the ghost with the most!",9,2,3,6 September 2019

The Godfather," My Big Fat Sicilian Wedding
","Big shout out to Flashback Cinemas for helping me finally, FINALLY, get this off my list of shame.Of course now I'm left in the precarious position of having seen it and NOT thinking it's the best thing ever. I really wonder how much of that is due to the films own legendary status because it's impossible to go into this for the first time and not know it's supposed to be one of the finest pieces of cinema ever crafted.I mean don't get me wrong, it's good. The performances are... WHAT HAPPENED TO AL PACINO?! I didn't know he could even do this! I think my first exposure to Pacino was The Devil's Advocate and he's been pretty over the top in most things I've seen but in this he's so quiet and understated but you know there's alot beneath the surface. Brando is great. Would have liked subtitles though for him, honestly.
I think what I most appreciated though was the way it handles the audience. These days it seems like most movies can't do anything without trying to explain everything. We get inundated with exposition but not here. Things are laid out beautifully so that just by paying attention you pick up on what's going on and who people are.There are a LOT of people though. With a lot of very Italian names. Had a bit of trouble keeping the rooster straight in my head. Fortunately this is one I'd definitely enjoy revisiting, which I can only imagine to be a deeply rewarding experience because it feels like there are a lot of layers here to explore and new things to hone in on.It's a great movie. I just don't think any movie could really live up to the massive hype machine of The Godfather. I can only imagine my estimation of it increasing though with future viewing.",8,0,0,27 February 2020
