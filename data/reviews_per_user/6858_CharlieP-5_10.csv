Deja Vu," Love at first sight
","I am like Will Rogers when it comes to time travel movies, I never saw one I didn't like. But this film added a few new twists. The time travel was combined nicely with a crime investigation and an unusual love story. One sequence where Denzel's character drives a vehicle simultaneously in two time dimensions was great entertainment, and the best part of the film for me.This is one of those films that can be fun to watch a second time, to enjoy picking up some of the subtle elements that were missed the first time through.The story broke a few time travel rules and left some technical aspects unexplained, which will lead to criticism from the sci-fi purists. Closing these gaps would have made the story more complicated and changed the flow, so I think they were justified. I gave it an 8 out of 10.",8,1,3,25 September 2007
Memento," What were they thinking?
","This film seems to operate on three levels. The first level is the reverse order set of scenes used to present the story. The second level is the understanding which comes near the end (beginning?) of the film when all the missing facts are provided in one scene. I thought I detected a third level, but was not sure that was intended until the closing scene, when such intent was made clear by the lines: 'I have to believe in a world outside my own mind. I have to believe that my actions still have meaning... even if I can't remember them. I have to believe that when my eyes are closed, the world's still there.' I think there are a couple of other underlying themes. If you like movies which make you think, you will probably like this one.",9,0,1,3 March 2002
That Thing You Do!," This was fun !
","This is the only film I have seen in the last 10 years that I cared to watch more than once.  If you ever enjoyed a dance at a small town National Guard Armory, dreamed of being in a 60's rock band, or just have some fond memories of the music and the times, you may just love this film.  Or if you are just tired of depressing films with heavy messages, this light little story is a very welcome break.The film is well done, and considering it is Tom Hanks' first directing effort, he shows great promise.  But Steve Zahn as the joking goofball Lenny was certainly the top performance.  Look for this guy in the future, because he will probably own this type of role.",10,0,0,3 July 1999
Chicken Run," A Great Escape for the viewer too
","This is a film which is likely to appeal to a very wide audience, from kids to grandparents. That is why I watched it - it was the only movie on the list that my wife and I could agree on together. We both liked it and that says something very positive.I enjoyed the subtle and not-so-subtle references to some great films of the past. For me, the early scenes based on The Great Escape were the best laugh in the film. I also detected winks at Braveheart, Stalag 17, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Flight of the Phoenix, Bridge on the River Kwai, and The Shawshank Redemption.If you are looking for a film with deep social commentary or complicated plot twists, keep looking. But for an evening of light entertainment, Chicken Run delivers.",8,0,0,8 February 2007
Crash," Is anyone listening?
","Perhaps I liked this film because of what it was not. Having heard that it was about racism, and had received some awards, I automatically expected the classic Hollywood treatment where the racists are easily identified by their southern accents, poor diction, use of politically incorrect terms, and obvious lack of education. This film took a broader view. Although many viewers seemed to think the film was dark and critical of humanity, I found it to be unrealistically optimistic because almost every character had some strong redeeming quality ... not true in 'real life'. If there was a general theme, it seemed to be that people don't really listen to each other ... because they don't need to ... by just looking at the person you know who and what they are ... and of course we know who and what we are ... so we already know everything. The tongue-in-cheek comedy sprinkled through the stories made it more digestible. I gave it an 8 out of 10.",8,1,8,19 March 2006
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Better than I Expected
","After reading some of the negative reviews on IMDB, I almost did not take the time to watch this one. That would have been a mistake. I suspect that a major factor in the way people see this film depends on their age and how much they know about the history of Hollywood and the TV shows and films of the 60's. There was a certain swagger in those times - and this film captured it. Younger viewers may not see the point of many of the scenes - they may not 'get it'. I also enjoyed the way the film played with the main characters - Rick played tough guys on the screen - but Cliff really was the tough guy. The twist at the end was great - caught me completely by surprise. But after all - the title is: 'Once upon a Time ... in Hollywood'.",8,1,1,16 March 2020
The Matrix Reloaded," A typical sequel ... disappointing
","Like other great sci-fi films based on a single concept, (Planet of the Apes, Alien) it is difficult to make a sequel that has the same impact as the original. In this case, they did not get close. Some of the effects were well done, but the fight scenes seemed a bit cartoonish, probably because I have seen it all before, in the first film. I gave it a six.",6,0,0,20 November 2003
Zero Dark Thirty," Something for Everyone
",I found the reaction to this film to be quite interesting. It seems that a lot of people found something to hate about the film. I thought it was pretty good - but then I judged it for what it was - a fictional story based on some things that actually happened. It was not a documentary. I think the creators wanted to give the audience a 'feel' for the long hunt for an elusive enemy and the dramatic conclusion. I thought it worked well on that level.But there was something to annoy just about everyone who is easily annoyed. Some did not like that this was NOT a documentary and played loose with some plot elements. Some were upset at the depiction of US agents using torture - others were upset at the implication that the torture actually worked. Some did not like the depiction of US soldiers killing men and women while children watched - like it was just another job while other resented the fact that a female CIA agent got most of the credit for the operation and not the men who carried out the mission.Something for everyone.,9,0,2,21 April 2013
The Bridge on the River Kwai," The madness of war and of the men who wage it
","One of my Top Ten films.  This film was remarkable in 1957 because it followed a long line of 'war movies' after World War 2 which glorified war and the soldiers who fought.  This film displays the absurdity of war, and the corresponding absurdities of humanity, and toys with the notion that the two are firmly linked.  Many may compare it to the more recent Saving Private Ryan, but the two films have completely different lessons.  Bridge is about the absurdity of war and the irrationality of those who fight, whereas Ryan is about the way in which brave men deal with the horrors of war, and the debt owed by all of us for their sacrifice.This film shares many of the same undercurrents as another one of my personal Top Ten motion pictures,  Planet of the Apes (1968).  I was surprised to recently learn that both films are based on novels by the same French writer, Pierre Boulle.  The screenplay for Planet of the Apes was written by Rod Serling (TV's Twilight Zone) and bears his unique style. If you have not seen either of these films, and like films that make you think, watch Bridge first, then Planet, and note the similarities.",10,6,11,26 June 1999
The Green Mile," Moving
","This is a good film, primarily because of Tom Hanks' subtle ability to portray a man who is tough, hard, and duty conscious, and at the same time compassionate and human. This character reminded me of Hanks' portrayal of Capt. Miller in Saving Private Ryan. A few scenes are grisly, but the tone of the film is generally positive, and several scenes are surprisingly moving. The supernatural powers of one character stood out strangely in a film that otherwise seemed to be dedicated to harsh reality, but I suspect that was intentional, for contrast, and it worked.One detraction was that I had a nagging suspicion that Hollywood was once again taking an opportunity to promote it's sociopolitical views, on capital punishment, race, and regionalism, but maybe I have become over-sensitive to this issue. At least they did not bash Richard Nixon, but then, it was set in the 1930's.Compared to American Beauty, this was a better film. I gave it a 9 out of 10.",9,1,1,18 June 2000
