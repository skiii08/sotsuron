Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The most awful in the universe of awful!!
","This is BY FAR THE MOST disgusting movie i have ever seen. Some truly boring films are in my seen-list, but this is the biggest crap i could imagine. So much advertising for what? - absolutely nothing!! I even had to turn it off without watching the ending. At first, maybe i could consider funny some of his remarks, but when he went to USA to scare people, i was just sitting and not understanding where and when to laugh.I don't get it, do you Americans laugh from 'borat' or from yourself for being so stupid?!",1,59,117,3 January 2007
