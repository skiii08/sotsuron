Blade Runner 2049," Weak product-placement pastiche of orginal masterpiece
","They tried so hard, but they failed.What's wrong with something just being a good movie? Why do you need to go back, rehash, remake and plagiarise something else? Plough your own furrow. Make your own work of art. Stop throwing money at something great and hope you can vicariously join its greatness because someone said you were allowed to. Why the hell do corporations want to product place in a dystopian future where people are nasty and all nature has died?If it was a stand-alone movie I'd give this film a 6 out of 10. Because it's just stealing from the original and is devoid of real creativity, I give it a 4. I mean it's not terrible, but it's just pointless. The story, music, acting, casting and direction are all just slightly inferior. The only thing better is the visual effects, but as good as they are they just didn't match up to the original is style well at all especially outdoors. At the end I just thought that someone had filled in all the blanks left about original movie. But I felt hollow, as honestly those were things I never needed to know and were far better left to my imagination.",4,1,3,26 December 2017
Darkest Hour," Yawntastic historical rewrite
","Winston Churchill was a total hawk and not a hero as many people believe. Most of the things he did killed innocent soldiers with ill-advised war strategies. He was also a pompous git. He never asked ordinary people what they thought on the 'tube' during the war, he was an elitist buffoon. He simply got lucky and was by chance the right man at the time during the early 1940's.Also Gary Oldman is not a genius actor, Churchill is about the easiest person to play in the world, be grumpy, grunt and smoke cigars, almost anyone could have done it. The makeup was competent but nothing special.All in all this wasn't even a patch on the also massively overrated Dunkirk. Darkest Hour was boring, nationalistic history rewrite of history. If you have any dignity avoid at all costs. If you are some Brexit loving gibbon this film might appeal to your jingoistic stupidity.",1,36,73,5 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The Rise of the Rehash - Part 3
","I really have to wonder what is the point of remaking films with nearly the exact same story but with different actors in each role. Sure, you can have better effects and a more gender and racially diverse cast, but a film's quality rests on the narrative. The narrative here is so entirely unoriginal, just one character replaces another from the original trilogy. Even the Emperor is reused as they could think of a better baddie. Even watching with very low expectations the movie still fails to deliver anything substantial, the acting is clunky, the music seems hammy and the narrative could have been better written by a group of children.",2,7,11,16 March 2020
Dunkirk," Overrated, but solid.
",A solid watchable film that doesn't really try to rewrite history. However it's emotionally vacuous and overrated.,6,1,1,22 March 2018
Avengers: Endgame," Finally over - thank god.
","I just don't get it. I tried to like this vacuous American drivel, but just can't. The whole thing is a stupid train wreck of nonsensical characters. hammy acting, loud thuds, baloney quasi-science and space effects. Just act well, have a worthwhile narrative, but no.Glinty effect hard on the eye visuals, like you just ate a kilogram of gummy bears, and now nature wants revenge. The acting is the worst, good actors that are aware of the camera and crew, so actually direction fail. Make a some cringe joke to try to distract.Just listen to the dialogue: I know, we'll use ether to time travel to go back in time to Asguard on board the muppet ship to get to the Smurf nano-crystals from Dr Oddface. Or something like that.Individually a character like Spiderman is fine, but with a Norse God and a talking chipmunk? It's like having a 'bonus' Hawaiian pizza. Not only do you get pineapple but you get chocolate and anchovies because more 'must' simply be better?Save it for a long haul flight or download it to your phone so you can watch it when you're on the throne. Well possibly your cell phone game might be more fun. If your IQ is under 70 or you are under 14 you might like it. Avoid the 3D version unless you like migraines and blurred vision, the gimmick that just won't die.",1,41,72,30 April 2019
Call Me by Your Name," Brokeback mountain in Northern Italy in 1983
","It's just a solidly acted romance flick with nice settings, good direction and acting. I score it a solid six regardless of the sexuality of the characters, because I find romance movies a bit boring and contrived. Why people seem to give reasonable romance flicks a ten out of ten because of some sexuality bias, I don't get it. I didn't think Moonlight was anything special either.I wish people would stop giving unwarranted praise, just base a movie on its own merits.",6,2,10,28 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," No inventinveness whatsoever
","I'm not a 'Comic book store guy' fan Star Wars. I simply liked the first few movies. The original movies were good because they were inventive. The Last Jedi simply has no inventiveness. They are supposed to be creating a Galaxy far away, but we get the tired old Naziesque 'Axis' Empire and obviously 'Allied' resistance rebels. That was adequate in the 1980's but now we need more depth of thought, intelligence and spirituality.They seem terrified to do anything new except appeal to Asian audiences a little more so it sits tediously in no-mans land. What if the Empire wasn't purely dark and the Rebels weren't entirely good? What of the only location filming wasn't a small Scottish Island?Is this all we get to the end of time? Anything inventive and popular just gets remade every 20 years with new actors? This is all becoming a cash cow formula.",3,3,5,31 January 2018
La La Land," You might like it, and there's nothing wrong with that!
","OK so this kind of movie really isn't my thing. I'm certainly not into musicals. Although I appreciate great acting and great music. However I do like jazz, so that certainly helped me get something from it. If you dislike musicals and jazz, I'd suggest you give this a wide berth!The opening part on the freeway and some of the later scenes had me reaching for the sick bag...and now a song, for no reason, staged backdrops and jumping around, clichÃ©. Why not make a movie with all the great music but have filmed stage performances and rehearsals instead of interjected 'and now...a song' moments? I suppose it wouldn't be a musical, but whatever.It would never be my go-to movie, but for some people, probably many wives and girlfriends it's a nice little comfort-blanket escapism piece of enjoyable fluff that's sincere, competent and harmless. Excellently shot, directed and acted.",6,1,3,4 March 2017
Sausage Party," Unfunny waste of time
","This was billed by one reviewer as the 'Team America' for this decade. I don't even understand the comparison. Team America was hysterically funny but this is complete tripe. This 'comedy' is the most unfunny thing I've ever seen. Even the idea of talking supermarket products is more lame than snakes on a plane.I can't understand why this film even has six stars out of ten, are people stupid or what? How does pointless swearing interjected into every sentence suddenly make everything funny? How are stupid racial stereotypes funny? I'm a talking bottle of chili sauce, I have a Mexican accent and a bandanna and swear a lot, (sarcasm)'ha ha my sides are splitting'(/sarcasm).I urge you, don't waste your short and precious life watching this drivel, save it for a long haul flight or download it to your phone and watch it when you are having a turd.",1,12,22,2 September 2016
Joker," Not to be missed
","It's not particularly scary or disturbing as I feared. It is a logical character development of how a real person could become so distrurbed that they could become a super-villian. Almost surprisngly The Joker not a psychopath or sociopath, but someone mentally ill in other ways, and just pushed too far by society and unlucky circumstance.Anyone intersted in high-level acting, direction, character development or psychology must see this film, you don't need to like it, but it can spark so such interesting discussion.Not seeing it puts you somewhat out of step with modern conciousness. Highly recommmended.",9,2,5,28 October 2019
Mother!," The history of human stupidity and selfishness
","The meaning of this movie is so entirely obvious. It's just about the stupidity and selfishness of mankind.The happy couple live in a lovely big house - an Eden, uninvited guests seemingly with nowhere else to go keep arriving. These arrivals could have been worthy guests, especially if they'd been good people and their visit had been announced. It's a big house and there is probably work that needs doing, but these guests are entirely self serving, loathsome and full of stupid and self-destructive habits. Many of the later arrivals are sociopaths and psychopaths that fight among themselves. They defile all that they see, even what is held sacred, and ignore good advice, as the most petulant adolescent might. On different occasions a few individuals try to help, but it's so fleeting to be of no consequence.The film is clearly drawing parallels between the way humans behave towards nature, the unsustainable industries and fighting over man-made concepts, no reverence of nature or care for all its genuine riches. A fact that depresses me every day - built into this story. Similar to James Cameron's Avatar without the blockbuster obviousness. There are also echoes of Christianity, and how people have misunderstood the true spirituality and meaning of it.I wonder if it's the case that people that see nature as something that's there to serve them and have dominion over, hate this film, or it's an effect of their cognitive dissonance or the style the story is told. Spiteful nonsense like Lars Von Trier films, often garner praise whereas Mother! being a similar concept with actors on a limited set is much deeper and far more meaningful on every level. I'll watch this film again to draw more from it.I wanted to give this film an eight or nine out of ten but some of the hateful reviews are just unbelievably childish, so I've given it a ten, just to balance things out. Surely if you don't like the meaning of the story you can accept there are some amazing performances and some sublime cinematography and direction, at least making it worth a five out of ten. If you like the Fast and the Furious, Transformers, going shopping to buy plastic products you don't need, or believe rigid fundamental religious dogma this film might anger you.",10,0,8,6 December 2017
Sully," A great movie from threadbare material
","Having seen various documentaries and media reports about the 'Miracle on the Hudson', I always believed that whilst the story was amazing, the story was far too short from which to make a motion picture. In my humble opinion, I'm still not wrong. The direction, acting and visual effects were absolutely top-notch weaving together absolutely the most that could have been scraped together, and often delving into Captain Sullenburger's personal life to find extra material. Whilst the film is entertaining, I was on occasion actually bored from being overly familiar with the few minutes of the main story. This main story of the take-off, bird strike and glide before ditching was told three or four times in various different ways. The later rescue and NTSB hearing were shown as were clips of the media circus and heavily padded out sections with the co-pilot and being on the phone with his wife.In short, a worthy picture that does its best with meagre material, whilst resisting the temptation to descend into fantasy. Absolutely worth your time but not great, due to the limited story.",6,5,8,13 September 2016
