The Mask," Unfunny and annoying
",This movie is supposed to be a comedy... I didn't find any of it funny Jim Carey is really into the roll but other than that its just boring in my opinion. Its very obnoxious with its humor and I get that that was the comedy at the time but PLEASE STOP shoving this awful looking CGI in my face! the color palet is just kinda weird its a lot of neon blue and was pretty distracting. I know a lot of people are probably gonna hate me for this review but hey at least I got my opinion out there,2,0,8,7 March 2020
