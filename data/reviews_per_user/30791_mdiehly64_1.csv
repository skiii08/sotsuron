Moneyball," 'It's all meaningless'
","Moneyball is a movie with promise that falls flat and leaves you feeling sick and sad.If it is supposed to do that, then bravo.The movie has some good sequences, but that's about it. It's one of those movies that you can see the preview for, and that's all you need.First, the only characters in the movie are Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill. NONE of the characters are developed further than reading their lines, particularly the players themselves, followed by his ex-wife and daughter, whose sequences don't fit into the movie at all. Secondly, only baseball fans are the ones that say you don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy it. I'm not a baseball fan, and I still don't get it, nor did I enjoy it. It is NOT entertaining. I go to the movies to be entertained. I don't need some deep, non-stated meaning at the end that leaves feel-bad ambiguity about why the story was told in the first place. At one point, Brad Pitt's character states that 'It's all meaningless', referring to the fact that if you don't win the last game of the season, the entire season was pointless. The same goes for this movie. If the ending sucks, the entire movies was pointless. The ending to this movie is absolutely terrible. I don't care if it's based on a true story, as if that is justification for a bad ending. In the end, the movies simply states that Brad Pitt's character was a loser. He made the wrong decision early in life, and then, at the end, another wrong decision...or was it? We never know! The closing scene is Brad Pitt listening to a song written by his daughter, summarizing his life....'Dad, you're a loser'. Huh? Did I really just watch an entire movie about losing? Life is hard enough, movies are supposed to be an escape, not a manipulation of your feelings to get a reaction for it's 'artistic value'If you haven't seen it, watch the preview, and save your time for something better, like Battlefield Earth...lol (sarcasm).",1,20,45,17 January 2012
