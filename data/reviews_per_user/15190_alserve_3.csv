Requiem for a Dream," Am I the only one who feels this way?
","I must admit I did enjoy the movie. However, I didn't think it was necessary for this film to fall back on old, negative stereotypes. Why did Darren Aronofsky feel it vital to his plot to play on the fears of white America by having the virtues of the addicted 'girl next door' defiled by the big bad black man?  It seems to be a common theme in these 'drug movies' that black men are cast as sexual predators, ready to pounce on the weakness of a daughter near you!! If you don't believe me, rent the movie Traffic, which incidentally netted Steven Soderbergh the nod for best director. In that movie, we have a poor little rich girl who spirals out of control, right into the clutches of the typical drug movie monster. Both movies had good points, and were so entertaining that I believe that they could have stood on their own without this unnecessary ingredient.",Null,0,0,9 June 2001
X-Men," A Pleasant Surprise!
","This was the best movie adaption of a comic book I have seen since the original Batman. I was disappointed with the limited role a star like Halle Berry played, but I can forgive them if they make up for it in the upcoming sequels. In addition I owe an apology to whoever did the casting. I cursed them night and day when I heard Hugh Jackman won the part, I was wrong. In fact he became Wolverine! Right down to the cigar. This movie is a must see for anyone who loved the comic.",Null,0,0,17 July 2000
Black Hawk Down," Hey folks, lighten up. It's a movie, Not a documentary!!
","I passed up on this gem when it first came out and I'm sorry I did. It may not have all the elements of a classic war movie, nevertheless it was still very effective storytelling.  The first thing that an intelligent moviegoer should realize, whether the movie is a 'period piece' or 'based on a true story', is that it can't be all factual. What I believe tripped a few people up about BHD is the almost reality TV style Ridley Scott employed. I'm sure many who are blindly hooked on this genre felt somewhat betrayed. Any drama on a historical event good or bad, realistic or propagandized should inspire one to do his/her own research.  These movies sometimes entertain and always raise questions that prompt me to search for more information on the topics raised by the movie.",Null,0,1,18 November 2003
