Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Very tasteless
","I expected to see a great comedy. Instead, I'd found a movie, which I can call in 2 words 'Extremely tasteless'. Jokes were on the level of last range of porno movies. Religious jokes? Is this in good taste? I doubt. Besides those remarks, there were several serious mistakes: Language - in Kazakhstan people speak Kazakh, for international contacts Republic of Kazakhstan officials use Russian, though Kazakh is an official language of the UN. Why Borat speaks Polish/Russian I don't understand. Kzazakhstan's National Anthem - not US National Anthem melody and NOT such words as in the movie. Again: waste of time and money.",1,15,33,9 November 2006
