Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," How It All Began
","The prequel to the Star Wars saga is not typical George Lucas Star Wars fare. There is no Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, or Darth Vader (although we do see his alter ego as a young boy here). The story is slower than the other Star Wars movies, but necessarily so, in that this introduces us to the characters and sets us up for what is to come. Perhaps this is why this movie was such a disappointment to so many fans of this saga. I also have to admit, it is my least favorite of the six movies, but this is not a bad thing. I also hate that it is my least favorite for all the wrong reasons. It is not typical STAR WARS fare, but, again, let me repeat, this does not mean it is bad. In fact, this movie shows that George Lucas is a darn good story writer and not just some whiz kid on special effects who has no talent for anything else. And as far as I'm concerned, the worst of STAR WARS is more often than not better than the best of everything else. 9 out of 10.",9,1,2,16 December 2006
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Noir Mixed With Cartoons
","The first time I saw this film was in a movie theater in the summer of 88. We were having a family reunion and we took our kids to see this. Imagine the first viewing. As the film started, I thought I was seeing a ROGER RABBIT short as a warm-up to the main event. I don't remember ever seeing a Roger Rabbit cartoon when I was growing up, but I thought 'What the heck? Even if it's new, it should be pretty good.' Well, about five minutes into this little short, a director yells, 'CUT!' and this little cartoon character in diapers yells, 'WHAT THE HELL WAS WRONG WITH THAT TAKE!' On first viewing, this was a little jarring, seeing this cartoon in diapers using rather racy language. On subsequent viewings, it was something innovative and a little cutting edge. This was the first cartoon I ever saw that was geared more toward adults.Animation with live action was nothing new, even in 1988, (SONG OF THE SOUTH, MARY POPPINS, AND PETE'S DRAGON anyone?) but the interaction between the cartoon characters and their live counterparts never looked so natural. Even in the more physical parts like when Baby Herman whacked his secretary on the fanny and Eddie grabbed Roger by the ears, dunked him in the sink, and slapped the handcuffs on him was pure genius. My hat's off to the actors and the film editors for this. It was very impressive. (Also the part where the gorilla bouncers threw Eddie out of the night club was very well done as well.) This movie told a good story as well and didn't just rely on gimmicks like a lot of films of this nature do. It was a standard noir detective story, very much like the time period it was set in. But I think this is the first time a toon was ever accused of murder. And Jessica was very sexy looking for a cartoon. How about Betty Boop being out of work because cartoons went to color? There are some really wonderful things in this movie.The video I got less than a year later was always a favorite whenever we had adult parties or sleepovers for kids. People of all ages loved this movie. And Bos Hoskins (hope I got that name right) did a wonderful job with his California accent. I would never have known he was British if I hadn't researched him on this site. And it's hard for me to think of Christopher Lloyd as anyone but eccentric but likable Doc Brown in BACK TO THE FUTURE. He did a great job playing mean old Judge Doom. A noir detective story mixed in with some wacky cartoon fun. A great little ride. 9.5 out of 10.",9,2,2,26 June 2007
Spider-Man 2," Good, Until the End
","Just saw this movie for the first time after reading all these glowing reviews. I'll agree, I like how they developed the characters a little more. After all, it's hard to write a good story if you don't know the characters, because it's hard to have a good story if you don't care about the characters. And it's hard to care about the characters if you don't know what makes them tick, what motivates them, etc. In that, they did an excellent job and it made for a good story. Because you know the characters better, you care about what happens to them, and it keeps your interest.Now, for the bad news. Towards the end of the movie, they indulged in stupid story writing and turned Spiderman into Dumbassman. Why in the name of all that is good and holy did they have him take off his mask while he was trying to stop the train? Was it because he couldn't see? If that's the case, why is he wearing the damn mask in the first place? That's right up there with the hockey game from hell in the BATMAN AND ROBIN movie as being the dumbest action scene ever written. Also, Doc Oc looked kind of weird rolling around like a bowling ball on top of the train every time Spidey hit him, but I guess that's just the nature of the material they were working with. And then, when the fight is over, this kid hands Peter the mask and says, 'We won't tell anybody.' Right, kid. A whole train full of people are looking down at his exposed face. How well will they be able to keep the secret? Now everybody in New York City knows who Spiderman is. As of this writing, another sequel is due out in about a month. How will he survive? Move to Chicago or something? This scene ruined what was otherwise a good movie, but not enough to make it awful. Also, both movies are disappointing in two ways: (1) I miss the wisecracks Spidey made in the comics while he's beating the crap out of the bad guys. (2) I would like to have seen the conflict between MJ and her father developed a little more and come to some kind of resolution. Otherwise, I've seen better, but I've also seen worse. 7 out of 10.

Batman Returns," Why, Oh Why Didn't Michelle Pfeiffer Wear A See-Through Catwoman Outfit?
","That is the burning question of this movie, and Catwoman and Penguin are the most complex villains in these BATMAN movies. Unlike the Joker, you see that Catwoman and Penguin were once put upon human beings before something happened to them to make them lose it. Michael Keaton reprises his roll as Batman and, as in the first movie, does an excellent job in conveying his inscrutable dark brooding intensity. Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman? Excuse me while I take a cold shower. Danny DeVito does almost as well as Burgess Meredith in his roll as the Penguin. Personally, I thought the Penguin was always the smartest and most dangerous of all the Batman villains. Again, we have a good story going and it's up to Batman to save the day. Very well done. 8 out of 10.",8,1,2,22 January 2007
Home Alone," Very Entertaining as Long as You Don't Think Too Much
","This is a movie you have to watch with your brain in neutral. If you think about it, you'll just go nuts. True, they threw plot logic out the window with this movie. A parent who would leave a child home alone, whether accidentally or not, would probably be visited by social services, be thrown in jail, and have their children taken away from them. (Especially if they do this two years in a row, but that's another movie.) The pranks Kevin pulls on these two stupid criminals should not be tried at home. Setting hair on fire, things of that nature would kill someone in real life. They should put up a disclaimer in this movie warning of the dangers of some of these pranks. Otherwise, it's a laugh a minute fun little romp, especially when it comes time for Kevin to defend his home. (Love the way he played a scene from ANGELS WITH FILTHY SOULS when he scared off the pizza man and when he scared off the burglars early in the story.) That business with old Mr. Marley (have to see the movie again to be sure I got that name right) was very touching at the end. It showed Kevin wasn't just another dumb, bratty little kid, that he had a heart of gold. Very entertaining. Just sit back, relax, enjoy the ride, and don't think too much.",7,0,1,6 December 2006
Sleepy Hollow," This Movie Should Have Been a Sequel
","This movie told an excellent story. My only complaint about it was it wasn't true to the original story. It should not have been called SLEEPY HOLLOW. Even though the original story is short, I think there is enough material in it for at least an hour-and-a-half feature film. There is a lot in the original story that could be fleshed out a little more by a good screen writer without making it drag too much. This movie would make a great sequel to the original story. It would have been better if they made the original story into a movie, called it SLEEPY HOLLOW and made this one a follow-up sequel. Remember, in the original story, it is not clear what happens to Ichabod Crane. A bit of gossip is relayed that he left Sleepy Hollow and became a lawyer or something. This movie could have been called SLEEPY HOLLOW 2, THE RETURN OF ICHABOD CRANE.Just a thought. The movie taken on its own terms is very good, as long as you can get past the fact that it doesn't have much to do with the original story. 8 out of 10.",8,1,2,24 February 2007
Glory," Northern Hypocrisy Exposed
","Throughout my school years, I had been reading and hearing all this high-handed stuff about how the North's cause in the Civil War was freeing the slaves. Granted, I think slavery is a horrible legacy in the South's history, but this movie shows that the Union treated African Americans no better than the South did. No, they didn't own slaves, but they would not allow African Americans who were willing to fight to fight, they equipped them with hand-me-down uniforms, some of them didn't even have a pair of shoes. They also underpaid the soldiers that did fight and many times they were relegated to doing menial chores, not much different than slave labor. It was good to see that they finally earned the respect of their peers and took part in the final battle. This movie did an excellent job in showing the North's hypocrisy about these issues.",Null,1,2,10 December 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Plot Thickens
","There is definitely more action in this movie than there is in THE PHANTOM MENACE, but the two stories put together shows good craftsmanship in writing a story. THE PHANTOM MENACE introduces the players and sets up the conflict, so it is by necessity slower than the rest of the series. ATTACK OF THE CLONES opens with at least two assassination attempts on Queen (Senator?) Padme. Enter Obi Wan Kenobi and an older, angrier Anakin Skywalker.I disagree with some posters that the love story was unnecessary. On the contrary, that was part of Anakin's downfall. Also, Luke and Leia were not immaculately conceived, like Anakin was supposedly. (I sort of question the wisdom of introducing that aspect into the story, but that's neither here nor there.) Yes, Anakin whines and complains a lot in this story, and while it can be annoying, someone who is about to cross over to the dark side of the force is going to do an awful lot of complaining and moaning, don't you think? Dissatisfaction with a situation people find themselves in is the strongest motivation in the world for them to make a change, whether it is for good or evil.One thing I will say, and this is true of all three of the prequels, and that is that George Lucas is showing his age a bit. These movies don't seem to have the edge that the first three did. Perhaps it is because we already know how the saga ends, but it seems to have lost some of its youthfulness. Still, they are fantastic stories and George Lucas is a talented story writer. 9 out of 10.",9,2,5,15 January 2007
Forrest Gump," Lessons In History--And Life
","So, what the hell is wrong with having a simple outlook on life? I think the reason we have a lot of problems in life is because we're too smart for our own good, that we always try to complicate things. I think that's what this movie was saying. Forrest Gump took life on its own terms, and he didn't sweat the little things. He just kept on keepin' on, and that's what the movie is saying. 'Don't sweat the small stuff.' You don't have to have an IQ of 75 to just relax and take it easy. Gump may have been smarter than most of his 'normal' contemporaries. Contrary to what Jeanie said to him, he knows better than most people what love is. His loyalty to her in spite of the way she crapped on him until she was almost dead is a testament to that. Until the end, she was a dingbat.Forrest first lost his best friend Bubba in Viet Nam. Then, he lost his mother. Then, he lost his Jeanie. Through it all, he remained stoic. There is something very noble in that. Intellectually challenged or not, he was still a human being with feelings. He was smart enough to know what dead is, what right and wrong are. When it gets right down to it, that's all we really need to know. This is a great movie. My only complaint about it is this guy who wrote the screenplay obviously didn't know diddly squat about Bear Bryant. Bear was not a very demonstrative coach. He wouldn't have been jumping up and down on the sidelines screaming, 'Run you sonofabitch, run!' Bear was always pretty stonefaced on the sidelines. Also, I can't help wondering how they made Gary Sinese look like he lost his legs. That was very impressive, whatever they did to do that. Also, intermixing Gump with now dead historic figures was very impressive, showing him shaking hands with JFK, LBJ, Richard Nixon, John Lennon. Still, number one is it is a good story. 9 out of 10.",9,2,4,17 July 2007
The Godfather: Part II," Parts of the Book That Were Left Out in Part One...
","...are included in Part II. This movie gives you the backstory of Vito Corleone's rise to power, from the time his father is murdered in Sicily until he 'makes his bones' and creates his own empire in the United States. Robert DeNiro is very convincing as young Vito Corleone in what was, if memory serves correctly, is his big screen debut. I was almost convinced he was somehow related to Marlon Brando, he had the voice, the looks, the mannerisms, everything. Couple this with another story not included in the book of betrayal within the family while Michael tries to make a move in pre-Castro Cuba and you have a sequel that is every bit as good as the original. Michael has been stripped of all his humanity in this story, and he comes across as being a cold and heartless human being, one who would even have his own brother killed to preserve his nefarious empire. The ending is heartbreaking because he realizes that he lost his family trying to save it. And the soundtrack in this movie is even better than the original GODFATHER soundtrack. For the third time, I'm going to give a perfect 10 to this movie.",Null,3,5,14 January 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Three Movies and One Comment to Cover Them
","I read these books over twenty-five years ago. By the time I saw these movies for the first time, enough time had passed that I had forgotten some of the finer points of the stories. For example, I had forgotten all about the Tom Bombadil episode, and I didn't think anything was missing when they didn't use it in the movie.When I read the books, I was curious how this would look on a movie screen with live action characters. I was especially curious as to what Gollum would look like. And while I'm on the subject of Gollum, let me put to bed right now the issue on Gollum being a conflicted character. He was not a conflicted character. He was purely evil. He hated Bilbo, Frodo, and Sam because Bilbo took the only thing in the whole world that meant anything to him, and he murdered his own brother to obtain that. The only conflict Gollum had with himself was in deciding when to do away with the hobbits and to confiscate the ring from them. He was smart enough to realize he couldn't strike at them prematurely. That was the only reason he argued with himself and showed any kind of restraint or submission. He would do anything to get his precious back to him.All of these stories were told very well. In fact, the movies were a lot easier to follow than the books were. The scenery was amazing in these movies. It looked very much like a fairy tale world. My only knock against them is that the battle scenes, when shown from a panoramic view looked too much like a video game with their computer graphics. Otherwise, the best use of computer graphics I've seen so far. And I am not a big fan of computer graphics. Decidedly a magnificent effort to bring these stories to life on the movie screen. I only wish that they would have done THE HOBBIT as a prologue to all this. It would have been great to precede this story with Bilbo's adventures. Otherwise, great. 9 out of 10 (for all of them.)",9,0,2,1 May 2007
The Shining," Lame, Lame, Lame!!!!!!!
","Maybe it's because I saw this on network television and never saw it in the theater or on video, but this movie was a piece of crap. It was never explained how or why Jack Torrance ended up being the maintenance man for some godforsaken hotel in the middle of the Rocky Mountains during the winter. I don't even think it told you he was an English teacher in a prep school and that he was fired for punching out a student in an alcoholic rage. If I had never read the book, I wouldn't have known these things. It had the look of a Tuesday Night Movie of the Week. The whole thing looked rushed. It was a joke. Shelly Duvall and Jack Nicholson both looked like caricatures. Jack Nicholson gives me the creeps anyway, and I can't look at Shelly Duvall without thinking of her as Olive Oyl in POPEYE. She looks like her, even in this movie. My friend and I laughed our asses off when Jack came in with that ax and started chopping up the hotel. His, 'Hi, Wendy, I'm home!' And '...Heeeerrreee's Johnny!' THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SCARY??? Please!!! Not worth another viewing. Well...maybe after I've had a six pack or two. 2 out of 10, only because I'm in a good mood. I can't believe this is from the same director who gave us PATHS OF GLORY.",2,17,39,30 November 2006
Rocky IV," Good Movie, Terrible Soundtrack
","Brought back memories of the Cold War. This movie gave us another good reason to hate the commies. Drago made Clubber Lang look like Mr. Rogers.As usual, this movie had the standard, inspiring Rocky fare, the go-get-'em speeches, the never-say-die attitude. This movie, like all the Rocky movies, are inspiring enough to raise a dead horse. It made me sad and angry to see Apollo get killed fighting Drago. I wanted to get in the ring with Drago myself when that scene was over. Paulie is his usual annoying self, and I think at one point, we have a slight mistake in plot logic. When Rocky and his entourage go to the Soviet Union for Rocky to train, Paulie makes his patented wisecracks. I kept expecting those Russians escorting them to either shoot him or send him somewhere unpleasant, as would have happened in real life back then.What I miss from this movie is Bill Conti's GONNA FLY NOW. Instead, we've got some eighties technogarbage that they're trying to pass off as music. For the music alone (and in this case, I use that term loosely), I knock five stars off of what is otherwise a good movie. 5 out of 10.",5,0,7,20 October 2007
The Exorcist," Disgusting
","My wife and I went to see this movie when we were still single and in college. She fainted about a third of the way through it and we had to leave. It was just as well, I had given that idea some thought myself before she finally decided she'd had enough. This movie was so bad, it doesn't even deserve a rating. This is another example of a good story idea, but they went just a little bit too far to get the message home. Why did that little girl have to pee on the rug after telling that astronaut 'You're going to die up there'? The statement in and of itself was chilling enough. Wetting the rug was a bit of overkill. In fact, it made it look comical and spoiled the effect in my opinion. We left when poor little Regan was doing sit-ups on her bed at turbo speed and sprouting profanities in a voice about six octaves lower than her normal voice. I really think that the only reason they made this movie was to see how far they could push the envelope. Like many seventies movies, I think it was made for shock value. Too bad. The premise for the story was pretty good. Just way too much overkill.",Null,3,5,21 January 2007
Duck You Sucker," Featuring Rod Steiger as Eli Wallach
","If the title of this movie didn't convince you that you were about to see something off-the-wall, the opening scene will. It starts off with one of Sergio Leone's trademark extreme close-ups of ants scurrying around a tree. Then you see water falling on it. After a few seconds of this, the camera pans back and you see...Eli Wallach? No. Rod Steiger with his pants down to his knees. He pulls and zips them up because what you're watching in the opening sequence is him urinating on that tree.Yes, I knew I was looking at Rod Steiger but he did a very convincing job playing Eli Wallach in this movie. James Coburn's Irishman seemed a little cool-headed for an Irishman. Also, there's this one scene where Leone does extreme close-ups of people's mouths while they were eating. That was a little gross, but what the heck? Just a minor gripe. It's still vintage Leone. He takes his time telling a great story and, as usual, the facial expressions of the characters tells a lot of the story without them having to say anything. And the story is very well constructed. And the new DVD version is fantastic. A great story told by a great story teller. And of course, let's not forget Morricone with his great music. (SEAN, SEAN, SEAN). 9 out of 10.",9,1,4,24 June 2007
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Let Me Get This Straight...
","You have a bunch of idiots on an island populated by carnivorous dinosaurs. One dude gets eaten alive by these little pirhana-like creatures while he's taking a whiz because he doesn't have sense enough to stay close to his party. Brilliant. I don't suppose it ever occurred to these idiots that meat eating also included human flesh if it was around when the dinosaurs were really alive. Then you have a bunch of people running around in the grass, knowing that there are grass raptors around. Again, brilliant. Where did these people get their science degrees? K-Mart Blue Light Special? Some dingbat picks up a baby tyrannosaurus rex because it has a broken leg and takes it to her lab to treat it. Uh..excuse me. That baby has a momma. And momma won't be very happy to see some human with her baby.Not content with all this silliness, they have to top themselves and, as far as I'm concerned, win the all-time prize for being stupid in a no stupid zone. They put a tyrannosaurus rex on a ship bound from Costa Rica to San Diego. Did they really think there was a cargo hold that could hold that creature for very long? And to add insult to injury, they have this same creature terrorizing the streets of San Diego. 'Mom! Dad! There is a dinosaur in our back yard.' Right. Go back to sleep, kid. And then he eats the dog? And drinks out of the swimming pool? This brings me to a dumb question. What effect would drinking chlorinated water have on a tyrannosaurus rex? Okay, enough of this foolishness. This movie was stupid, and the so-called scientists did not show an ounce of common sense. And neither did the script writers. 1 out of 10.",1,77,166,31 January 2007
JFK," Pure Speculation
","A lot of garbage has been bantered about JFK's assassination, and this movie is more of the same. It's good for entertainment, but I wouldn't recommend taking the theories they are postulating seriously. The theories are interesting, but they have no evidence to support these theories whatsoever. It is pure speculation. We may never know the whole truth about what happened in Dallas, Texas on November 22nd, 1963. Personally, I think the Warren Commission is true for two reasons: (1) The government couldn't do something like an assassination that neatly and cleanly. They would find a way to screw it up, because you have too many people in the government with their own agendas going. (2) Jack Ruby in the Mafia? NOT BLOODY DAMN LIKELY. Ruby was a hothead. Hardly the type who would work for the Mafia. He was the type of person the Mafia would love to make an example of. Craves too much attention, talks too much.My evaluation? Interesting. But no basis in fact. If this were presented in a courtroom, it would be tossed out for lack of evidence. No wonder Jim Garrison lost the case against Clay Bertrand. 5 out of 10.",Null,10,30,26 November 2006
Amadeus," The Movie That Made Me Appreciate Mozart
","Before I saw this movie, I respected Mozart's genius, but his music wasn't my cup of tea. Beethoven was more to my taste, I tended more toward heavier classics. But this movie moved me to tears, especially at the end when they did Mozart's REQUIEM while he was working on what was to be his last piece of music. Now, I'm a Mozart fiend. This was a great movie. True, there are some historical inaccuracies. Anyone who has studied music history knows that Sallieri did not help Mozart with his Requiem. It was a student of his named Sussmayer. But it does make this story ironic, that the man who was so dedicated to the ruination of Mozart ended up helping him in the end. (I question the historical accuracy of that as well.) I recently bought the director's cut to this movie. Until I saw the director's cut, Sallieri seemed like a more sympathetic character, someone who just couldn't buy a break. Who can't identify with that? But after seeing the director's cut and seeing what I think is an important scene between Sallieri and Mozart's wife, he seemed more like a jerk. You also understand why Frau Mozart was so rude to Sallieri at the end of the movie, whereas before, you see the next to the last scene and you think, 'Whoa! Where did this come from?' This was a great movie, for entertainment value only. If you want historical accuracy, watch a documentary or read a biography from the library or something. Because of this movie, I am now a rabid Mozart fan. If the movie can make Mozart converts, then it can't be bad at all.",9,102,110,26 November 2006
Patton," Character Study of A Great WWII General
","Patton was a tough old goat. Some say he was a real SOB. But you had to have an SOB to defeat another SOB and Patton fit the bill. To take on an enemy like Hitler, we needed a leader like Patton, someone who had no qualms about 'holding on to the enemy by the nose and kicking him in the ass.'The hospital scene is what I think bothers a lot of people about this movie and also what I think stirs up a lot of controversy. What has to be understood here is that when taking on the Germans of WWII, any display of cowardice or weakness could not be tolerated. What Patton did to the soldier in that tent was nothing compared to what the Germans would have done to him if he had been captured and sent to a POW or concentration camp. The Germans of that day were a sadistic lot, as history will tell you, and they would have had a field day with an American soldier blubbering and crying. These were the kind of people they loved to torture. This was tough love before anyone ever thought of the phrase. Patton was basically saying, 'Come on, soldier, grow up! We're at war here and if you don't shape up, the enemy is going to kick your ass even worse than I am.'This movie shows an unapologetic look at a great general, and forces you to accept him on his own terms. Was Patton perfect? Of course not. Nobody is. But he was the right man for the right time and he did his job well. No one can fault him for that. Interesting that his birthday is on VE Day. Great movie, great character study. 9 out of 10.By the way, my favorite line(s). Patton just got a call from Beetle Smith and is being raked over the coals for refusing to denazify his staff. The politicians didn't want to make the Russians mad at them, and, every time I see this movie and hear this, I cheer and say, 'Right on, George, go for it! Give 'em hell!' He says, 'To hell with the mongoloid Russians. You tell Eisenhower to give me the word and I'll start a war with those sons of bitches and make it look like their fault...I'll kick their behinds back to Russia where they belong.' YESSSS!!!!!!!",9,3,6,18 January 2007
Kelly's Heroes," Anachronistic
","This movie should have been titled THE HIPPIES FIGHT WORLD WAR II. Between Lalo Schifrin's seventies music and Donald Sutherland's laid back personality and hippie language, I thought at first I was seeing a Viet Nam flick. But this is a pretty good caper film. (How in the world a private overstepped a sergeant I'll never know. That's another way the plot strains credibility.) Yes, a private (Clint Eastwood) was giving orders to superior officers in their quest to get 16,000 gold bars from a bank behind enemy lines shortly after D-Day. He probably got court martialed for insubordination when he got back to the states, but the movie doesn't tell us. Guess we'll never know.By and large, this movie is amusing, but the anachronistic language and soundtrack, as well as the chain of command in this scheme, strains credibility. Telly Savalis is hilarious as Big Joe, and Clint Eastwood kind of underplays his roll a bit until he starts hatching up this scheme. Don Rickles is his usual sarcastic self, and Donald Sutherland is from La-la-land. The video box cover says that he was probably the first hippie. Whatever. If there really was a guy like that fighting with our boys during World War II, his fellow soldiers would have ragged his ass to the dogs and back. And a pre-Archie Bunker Caroll O'Connor is a hoot as the general who intercepts their scheme on the radio and gives them medals for taking initiative during combat because he thinks they're pushing deep into enemy territory.Very entertaining if you just enjoy the ride and don't think too much. 7 out of 10.",7,1,3,11 July 2007
Caddyshack," A Guilty Pleasure
","Normally, this isn't my kind of movie. Monty Python style humor just doesn't turn me on that much. Neither does watching people get loaded on grass or anything else. But once in a while, I like to watch a movie that doesn't make you think too much. Just makes you laugh. As Stephen King once said, it doesn't hurt to feast on bologna every once in a while.In my own personal checklist, this movie has everything going against it. It's a little too raw in places, it's full of juvenile sex episodes, it has people smoking dope, and there is no coherent plot line or point to the jokes. But that is also the beauty of it. It is patently absurd and that makes it laugh out loud funny. I like that they borrowed music from other films for some scenes in this movie; the James Bond style music used when Carl is pursuing that gopher, the JAWS excerpt when the Baby Ruth bar falls in the swimming pool (incidentally, I never liked Baby Ruths, even before I saw this movie.), and the excerpt from THE TEN COMMANDMENTS when the Bishop played golf in the middle of a thunderstorm. I also loathe eighties music, but Kenny Loggins's I'M ALL RIGHT was perfect for this movie, and I was humming it long after it was over. Go and figure. I have every reason in the world to hate this movie, but I love it. And don't get me started on Cindy Morgan. YOWZUZZZ!!!!! Wonder what she's doing now? Anyway, even though I have every reason in the world to pan this movie, I like it for the very reasons I should hate it. It's a nice, farcical little party and makes you forget your troubles. Maybe because they had great talent like Ted Knight and Rodney Dangerfield in it. And Chevy Chase was a perfect Joe Cool type character. And Bill Murray was crazier than an outhouse rat as Carl. Sadly, I've had some brief, casual encounters with Viet Nam vets who are, shall we say, not playing with a full deck. That is who Carl reminded me of, and those fellows are a sad lot indeed. I'm being a little bit too generous, but 7.5 to 8 out of 10 for this one.",Null,2,4,13 January 2007
Once Upon a Time in America," Destination...Nowhere!
","I really don't know what to make of this movie. I am a staunch Sergio Leone fan, his spaghetti westerns and his once upon a time movies. But this movie is kind of a mixed bag for me. Like GODFATHER III, this is a case of a great story, but at the end of the movie, you're left asking that famous immortal question...'WHAT?' This is a great journey that in the end, goes nowhere. I have no problem with a long story, or with the jumping back and forth in time, or with the many plot lines. It's just that at the end, this great story began to collapse under its own weight and we got an ending that didn't make any sense. And I don't buy into the theory that this was all an opium-induced dream. If that were the case, this whole damn story would be totally pointless, just a waste of time. I doubt very seriously that Leone would cheap shot his audience like that. It would be taking an awful long time to say, in effect, 'I was only kidding, folks.' A joke is a joke, but for that much effort? Eh...Like I said, it told a great story, but it doesn't seem to have an ending. Just Noodles with that goofy smile and you don't really know why, other than he's stoned out of his gourd. 7 out of 10.",7,1,5,20 September 2007
Titanic," So, Did It Sink?
","Where is the suspense in a movie like this? Anybody who hasn't spent their whole life living in a cave knows what happens in this movie. I knew what would happen over thirty years before this movie even came out. The fictional love story between Jack (for once NOT played by Jack Nicholson) and Rose was a tear jerker, but a little over the top. Also, it seems like the producers/director of this movie used it as an excuse to promote class warfare. To give this movie its due, it is a good story, and that is what saves it from total mediocrity. The story is told through the eyes of one of the last of the survivors of the Titanic disaster, an elderly Rose. I highly doubt that the rich folks in this movie were the jerks they were portrayed in this movie. I give it a 6 out of 10, only because it is a good story.WARNING: MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD: It sank.",6,0,2,8 December 2006
The Untouchables," Eliot Ness; Nerd Accountant
","I have never been a big fan of Kevin Costner's, though I do have several of his movies. I tend to buy movies mainly for the story and not for who is in them. On the flip side of this, I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood, and there are a few movies he made that I either haven't seen or only seen once because I don't think they're worth watching. But on to THE UNTOUCHABLES.When I commented on the television show, I mentioned that Costner plays Ness more like a nerdy accountant. I don't particularly like this interpretation of Ness, although after reading Ness's bio, I understand that this was the way he really was. I suppose it makes sense, since he worked for the treasury department.This is a great story about the Chicago underworld in the thirties and the men who helped bring them to justice. And what have we here? Another soundtrack by the great one, Ennio Morricone. Slightly different fare from his great spaghetti Western scores, but still not bad. I'll take Morricone on a so-so day before I'll take most other composers on their best day.Robert Di Niro is chilling as the ruthless Al Capone. Did he win an Oscar for that performance? He should have. And the movie kept you on the edge of your seat, wondering how this chess game was going to be played out. Interesting that Frank Nitti met his demise after Capone was convicted of income tax evasion. He lasted a pretty long time in the TV show. And Jimmy Malone's statement is so true. In order to win a war on crime, you have to play dirty. To borrow a quote from the movie, 'If Capone comes at you with a knife, you bring a gun. If he sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue. That's the Chicago way.' Ness had to slaughter all sorts of sacred cows to bring Capone and his men down. But that's what it takes sometimes to keep this country safe. Something our politicians should think about before they pass legislation protecting the rights of criminals. 9 out of 10.",Null,0,2,8 June 2007
The Godfather: Part III," Don Vincenzio
","After sixteen years, a third GODFATHER movie is in our midst. I think the whole Coppola family had a hand in making this movie. They probably should have changed the Corleone family to the Coppola family.This movie isn't as good as the other two, but it still isn't bad. Michael is trying to redeem himself by going into legitimate business and making generous contributions to the church. However, he finds out that the hierarchy of the church is just as crooked and dangerous as the Mafia. Did this movie perhaps foresee the scandal problems of the Catholic church? Who knows? There is even some suggestions that some Mafia members had moles inside the church who possibly assassinated Pope John Paul I. How's that for stirring up a hornet's nest of controversy? Now, the bad part. The ending sucked wind. I mean, what the hell was that all about? In the next to the last scene, Michael's daughter Mary is murdered by a hired assassin. In the next, Michael is sitting outside a little house in Sicily and falls out of a chair. Then the screen goes dark and the credits roll. WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? I know he died in that scene, but the ending looked like something that was cut and pasted on the last scene. There is no transition to this scene, just a montage of scenes from the other two movies to the accompaniment of CAVALIERA RUSTICANA. Then, BOOM! An aged Michael Corleone is just barely able to put his glasses on before he falls dead out of his chair. Was this whole movie supposed to be a flashback or something? The ending really ruined it I thought. Sad ending to a great saga. 6 out of 10 for that lousy tacked on ending.",6,0,1,14 January 2007
Psycho," Two Psychos in This Movie?
","Yes, we all know that Norman Bates was a psycho, but I tend to think that Marian was, too, to a lesser degree. It seemed that from the beginning of the movie until she was murdered, she was becoming more unhinged. She seemed paranoid throughout all her scenes, always looking over her shoulder, always nervous. Of course, she had reason to be, but something about these scenarios she played in her head while she was driving to Fairvale seemed unreal. Also, that cop that followed her to California was very unnerving. I sometimes wonder if that was real or a dream, or is Hitch leaving us to decide for ourselves if it is or not. Again, this scene seemed surreal. (That cop looked freaky. Like a commandant of a Nazi concentration camp or something.) Wasn't that Robert Stack who played the gentleman who sold her the car? It sure looked and sounded like him.This is another case of a beautifully crafted story. The way they played up the Norman/mother thing was just pure gold, what can I say? In 1960, this was probably pretty risqué, the opening scene showing Marion in a bra and a night slip in a cheap motel. Also, as I recall wasn't it kind of uncommon to show toilets in a bathroom in the movies? I know the codes were pretty strict back then. And the murder scene. Stephen King mentioned in his book DANSE MACABRE that you never actually see the knife striking Marion. You know what? He's right. I've seen this film dozens of times since I read that book and you don't see the knife actually striking her. Your imagination shows you that. But that movie has a helluva kicker at the end. I'm sure there are still one or two people out there who haven't seen it, so I won't spoil it for them. This is the only Hitchcock movie I have, and it's a doozy. A really great film from a legendary story teller. 9 out of 10.",9,0,0,15 May 2007
The Green Mile," Mr. Jingles Kicks Butt!!!
","Not many movies do Stephen King's novels justice, but this one was a pleasant surprise. John Coffey is the gentle giant falsely accused of raping and murdering two young girls in depression era Louisiana (Mississippi in the book)and is awaiting execution on death row, known as the green mile because the walk to the electric chair is over a green floor. Tom Hanks plays as the death row warden Paul Edgecomb who takes on a Pontius Pilate roll when he is made to realize that John is innocent of this heinous crime. One weeps as John is led to his execution at the end of the movie, but one also feels relief for him because, as he told Paul, he wanted it to be over. 'I'm tired, boss. Dead tired,' he repeats throughout the movie, and it sounds almost like the refrain of a folk ballad. 'I'm tired of people being ugly to each other.' John had a gift of healing but also the curse of feeling others' pain, and it was this that he wanted to be released from.Mr. Jingles was an entertaining balance to the grisly scenes in the execution chamber, and John heals him after a mean-spirited guard stepped on him and broke every bone in his body. (What was with Percy anyway? The guy went postal over seeing a mouse, and I don't think the book even explains this very well.) Incidentally, wasn't that Mr. Jingles I also saw in SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION as Andy Dufresne was being led down 'the hole' into solitary confinement? I wonder...Great movie. Surprisingly gentle for a Stephen King story. 9 out of 10.",9,0,2,1 March 2007
Jaws," I Haven't Been To the Beach Since 1974
","That is how much this movie plays with your head. I know, there is very little chance of being attacked by a shark, but that one or two or however much percent chance of that happening was enough to convince me to stay out of the water after seeing this movie. Let's face it, folks, 'Bruce' or 'The Great White Turd' as Steven Spielberg himself affectionately called him (and that's what it looked like when Brody shot him and he sank to the bottom of the ocean) made King Kong, Godzilla, Frankenstein, the Wolf Man et al look like wimps. Some of the macabre humor in this movie made you feel uneasy while you were laughing, eg., Mayor Vaughn's line 'I'm not going to have all these people standing around here while you do some half-assed autopsy on a fish.' As good as this movie, and the book is, I can't help thinking that this story is a rip-off of MOBY DICK, with Captain Quint being the Captain Ahab character with his obsession with capturing the shark, and in the ugly manner in which he died. Also, at least in the book, Chief Brody was the sole surviving Ishmael character (in the book, Matt Hooper gets eaten alive while he is in that shark cage). Also, great white whale vs. great white shark. A lot of parallels.This movie does keep you on the edge of your seat. And this is the soundtrack that put John Williams on the map. Before, he was the man behind TV shows THE TIME TUNNEL and GILLIGAN'S ISLAND. He also did those Irwin Allen disaster movies EARTHQUAKE, THE TOWERING INFERNO and THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE. Now, he is probably the greatest living composer (along with Ennio Morricone). The thing about this soundtrack is, when you listen to it by itself, you don't have to watch the movie to know what is going on. It is so vivid, you can picture in your mind's eye exactly what is happening on the screen. Great horror thriller and soundtrack. 8 out of 10.",8,2,5,27 January 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A Nice Bridg to Episode Four
","Many secrets are revealed in this movie, the secret of the Sith, the connection between Senator Palpatine and Darth Sidious, and why there are only two Siths, a master and an apprentice. In some ways, this is a nasty movie, and I don't mean this in a negative way. The nastiness is essential to the story, and a very well written story it is. Even George Lucas himself said that he put in some PG-13 material in this movie because the storyline demanded it. Not a thing wrong with that. We see the long duel between Anakin and Obi Wan and see the agony of Anakin as he crawls out of the lava pit. The final agonized scream of the newly anointed Darth Vader at the very end of the movie when he learns of the death of his precious Padme is revealing within itself. I can't help but get the impression that Vader/Anakin lived with the guilt of Padme's death for the rest of his life. A great story beautifully crafted. 9 out of 10.",9,2,5,15 January 2007
The Godfather," A Perfect 10
","THE GODFATHER is an example of how stories change over the years. In Washington Irving's LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW, we had the headless horseman. In Mario Puzo's GODFATHER, we had the headless horse.In all seriousness, there is only one other movie I have given a perfect 10 to so far, and that's TORA TORA TORA. It took me a while to appreciate this movie. The first time I saw GODFATHER, I saw more blood and gore than I remember ever seeing in any movie before, though it's pretty tame by today's standards. My mind wandered quite a bit during it and I came out of there kind of glad it was over. Then, several months later, I heard the soundtrack and I liked it so much, I thought I would give this movie another chance. It has come to be my all time favorite movie. And the music is still great. The mellow, folklike soundtrack provides a nice balance to the violence that goes on throughout the movie.Francis Ford Coppola is faithful to the book and tells the story very well. Watching the way certain scenes are set up is like watching the workings of a fine Swiss watch, it is that good. It gives depth and insight into the workings of the Mafia that no other movie before or since ever has. The point of view this story is told in is controversial, ie, they give you possible justifications for some of the things they do, and it almost makes you sympathize with the characters. The most telling lines in the story is when Michael comes back after hiding out in Sicily for the murder of a police officer and a bigshot in a rival family. He is talking to Kay, telling her he has decided to go into business with his father, and tells her that his father is no different than anyone else who is responsible for people's welfare, like a Congressman or President. Kay states that is naive because Congressmen and Presidents don't have people killed. Michael then fixes her with that patented stare (Al Pacino was perfect in this role) and says, 'Who's being naive, Kay?' That is a very chilling moment, as is Michael's transformation from wholesome American war hero to the head of one of the most powerful Mafia families in the country. Another telling moment is when Michael meets with his father in the garden and they are discussing business strategies, and the Don says, 'I don't apologize for my life. I did what I had to to protect my family, and I refused to be a fool for those pezzanovante who were holding the strings.' In conclusion, you will have a tough time convincing me that there is a Mafia movie anywhere that is better than THE GODFATHER. 10 out of 10.",10,1,3,14 January 2007
