Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The critics are wrong; 'The Phantom Menace' is fantastic!
","To contradict the harsh criticisms of many TV and newspaper personalities, 'The Phantom Menace' is an excellent film.  The acting is not poor in any way.  Natalie Portman & Liam Neeson especially deserve recognition for their spectacular performances.  Darth Maul is the perfect devil-incarnate villain providing the same mysterious presence & intrigue as Boba Fett (with about the same amount of screen time); & despite popular opinion, I found Jar Jar adorable & entertaining.  I would go so far as to say it is visually perfect.  The sets, costumes, stunts & effects are mind-blowing and the characters are as charming as they are beautiful; the pod-race & lightsaber battles are not to be missed!  I also can't wait to see characters such as Darth Sidious & Mace Windu emerge more in episodes II & III.  This film provides a thorough introduction to both the characters & the plot of the upcoming and already existent episodes.",10,0,1,19 May 1999
