Changeling," Oscar worthy act & direction of the year
",There are two surprises I found in this movie. # 1- It's not always that Hollywood's glamour dolls are for steaming the screen. This is the movie in which we can cherish Angelina Jolie in the most accomplished role of her career & I'll be surprised if I won't see her name in Academy nominations for the Best Actress category for this year. # 2- The movie was directed by none other than forever cowboy Clint Eastwood and this is again Oscar worthy film of the year in direction. Again a superbly crafted period thrilling drama from this genius actor turned director. The movie is based on true incident occurred in 1928 Los Angeles. A single living mother's son disappeared. She lodged a police complain & they returned her boy after few months. But he's not his child. The child was just fabricated face of corrupt LAPD & now the mother is threat. Next police declared her as insane & delusional & sent her to mental asylum. What happened to boy & the mother in this case??? Better you watch this slowly gripping drama of the year. Perfect sets & production of 1930's L.A. & soothing camera work by Eastwood's stalwart camera man Tom Stern made the film more intense & original with minimalist touch of Eastwood film. Jolie's period look & convincing mature acting simply gain the empathy of the audience. All the supporting actors have done realistic act including small but significant role of John Malkowich. It's period film belong to the time of 1928 when women in US were not entitled to vote & they were treated as third class citizens & women liberalization & rights were far on horizon. It's also the time of corrupt police & politics in US. So the film is a true case document of how a desperate mother struggled hard & turned the tables of corrupt LAPD & get the fair justice not only for her nut for whole society. Kudos to Eastwood for his brilliant theme & direction. Must Watch of the year. (This film will sweep the Oscars next year in many categories.)Ratings-9/10,9,5,9,7 December 2008
Requiem for a Dream," American dream or American tragedy?
","This is one of the most shocking dark & tragic film I have seen in a long back. The movie which made me shock & awe before this is 'American Beauty' which is one of my all time favorite one. It's not great acting, classic cinematography or touch wood direction but shattering & shocking portrayal of chasing American Dream & its tragic reality which still lingers in memory when I first watched that Oscar winning gem of Sam Mendes. Now here Darren Aronofsky has done something which has done same impact on your mind. In a very poignant way he jumbled up sharp cutting images of various dreams about love, fame, money, beauty, and hope into the lives of four central characters of the film. How Drugs entered into each character's life & fulfill their escape route to their dream till they all reached doom is also something very original in theme as well as projection. Every actor has done nice justice to their complex roles but it's Ellen Burstyn as a lonely old age mother who breathes in the character of Mrs. Sara Goldfarb 7 it's really an Oscar worthy act. Film is technically appealing with cool visuals & sound adding substance to the film. Infect it is the execution of that visual style which has captured the essence of this brilliant script by Hubert Selby Jr. This is dark modern classic which may become another dark drug film if the viewer is not involved in itIts emotional & subjective involvement into this tragedy which makes it altogether different experience.Brilliant work of Art.

Kung Fu Panda," panda rocks...kung fu too
","Without a doubt this is the absolute entertainment movie of the year. DreamWork has already created history with the release of this film & with its progressive & creative brilliant output its certainly becoming a big challenge for Disney- Pixar. The movie is full of entertainment package bundled with fun plus action animation. 100% entertainment, superb animation graphics (DreamWork is improving here by leaps & bounds) & incredible & touchy characters is all guaranteed in this film. It's definitely tough fight for Wall E in next Oscar. Well its story of an ordinary fat giant Panda named Po (one of the most lovely character launch of this year) who is daydreaming about being dragon warrior. To fulfill his dream he has to convert all his minus into plus & how he does that impossible possible with the help of mentor Shifu & 5 fighters is a thing to watch. The voice over is also nicely done with wonderful actors like Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogen & the master of Kung Fu  Jackie Chan. What to say about cute & touchy Po!!! Animation has grasps every emotional expression of his ups & down. I mean this is the only animation character which I would like to compete with my all time favorite- Cub Simba (The Lion King). Similarly the character of old Oogway & Shifu is also something amazing about the film. I'm desperately looking forward for its next part. Panda Po rocks & Kung Fu too.Must Watch.Ratings- 9/10",9,0,0,12 December 2008
Citizen Kane," 24 carat GOLD
","Few films in the history of cinema have received as much analysis & acclaim as 'Citizen Kane'. This is most admired film of all times & considered by many thinking men as a best piece of cinema by legendary actor, film maker Orson Welles. It is debut film of Orson Welles as a Director.America's largest & most powerful landlord of Xanadu & Newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Cane died with the last uttered word 'Rosebud' in the very initial scene. Next we see News clips & documentary featuring the power & riches story of his biography including his rise & fall of empire covered by every news agency of the world. Now the million dollar question for the reporters is who or what this last spoken word 'Rosebud' supposed to mean. The flashbacks of Cane's life unfold by the other characters reveals the life story of social & personal ups & down of his life & its really sentimental & realistic portrayal I have ever seen. Welles has told the story of a man increasingly captive of his own needs. Even as the suspense about 'Rosebud' unfolds in the last scene to the audience, it still remains enigma to figure out what it is. Orson Welles has done remarkable work here in acting & direction & production at the age of 25 & its simply his inborn talent. Its character not only the character of lifetime for him but for the world of cinema to cherish forever. The movie's technical brilliance lies in its landmark B&W cinematography by George Toland with apt use of light & shadow & deep focus photography. One can also notice the powerful lines of dialogues & speech uttered by Cane throughout the film. Most of the principal actors in 'Citizen Cane' were new to the motion picture & yet everyone performed extraordinary especially Joseph Cotten as Jad. The movie is regarded as the 'world's best film by Sight & Sound magazine in the last 40 years (1962-2002). It is quite sad to know that it was flop at box office but gradually became admirable classic as time passed. Nominated for 9 awards at 1942 Academy awards it only won one: Best Original Screenplay. A Pure Gold.Ratings- 10/10",10,10,14,13 November 2008
Coraline," one of the finest animation of the year
",I'm back after long tour of North India and confused among all the heap of DVDs lying on my table from a month or so and than I found this fine animation film. I'm impressed by the wonderful imagination world of story writer and Director Henry Selick.Coraline is a sweet little girl whose parents are busy in their own world and don't pay much attention to her. So she felt bored and neglected in her newly shifted home. One night the girl discovered a secret magic window leads her to different world. The fantasy becomes her other home with replica button eyed parents fulfilling her every demands. She meets her weird friend Wybie and flexi neighbor Bobinski in this other world too. It becomes routine matter for her to witness this other fantasy home at night and returns to real world in the morning when she wake up. But as the story progress it intrigues you completely as in the case of cute Coraline who lured away by the scheming of other fantasy home. All glitter isn't gold always.The blending of graphics and animation is full of innovation and originality and shows pool of creativity and that's make the film different from all other earlier seen cutie animation flicks.Recommended to all animation lovers.Ratings-8/10,8,1,3,18 June 2009
12 Angry Men," A nugget of Lumet...
",It's case of 18 years old boy who killed his own father with a knife & there are enough testimonials & proofs to prove him guilty. A jury consists of 12 men has been appointed to solve this court trial with their unanimous vote in a room. Now this is not the usual plot. It's the thesis of the film. How it become anti-thesis & arrives in the end with synthesis on a discussion table among these 12 jury is a thing to watch here. Sidney Lumet has directed so many brilliantly scripted films but this one is his real masterpiece & remains classic forever. Without a doubt this is Henry Fonda's career best performance played with a reasonable nuance. Lee J. Cobb as the last stubborn man standing also did a brilliant work.Highly Recommended.Ratings-9/10,9,0,0,25 November 2008
Knocked Up," Loudest Fun ever seen...
","I agree that Seth Rogen is being seen in almost every next Hollywood comedy this days but I also believe that he is one of the spontaneous comedian & quite perfect in good for nothing fellow roles. This movie represents him in a complete fun package. The movie is full of gags, adult humor & successfully tickles your funny bones in first half (if u like this sort of loud gag bag comedy), even the sentimental lines of the film remain the hilarious one but in second half it turned to show up some sentimental part. Katherine Heigl played a girl next door role here with her characteristic charm. Worth to watch if u like Comedy of Rogen.Ratings-7/10",7,0,1,23 November 2008
Burn After Reading," Coens are back with a bang...
","The first thing which is noticeable about the movie is the cast- George Clooney, Brad Pitt, John Malcowich, Tilda Swinton, Frances McDormand & Richard Jenkins. Last years academy award director duo-Coen Brothers are back this year with what they are best at- wry dark humor & situational fix drama but this time burning their bucks on huge star cast (as you see the above list). CIA agent Cox was fired & his CD containing his memoirs became the object of turmoil in every character's lives. It's quite complicated & insulting for the film if I write anything further about the story because that will mar the mood for its viewers. Well the movie is short & so every character has to play a limited time roll & scenes to show their talents within the complicated script. For example- Brad Pitt's character is just surprising & seems like a guest appearance. Apart of all the characters & actors here the script is the real hero. Out of all glossy star cast the full marks goes to Francis McDormand's performance that put a life in such a complicated character. Movie isn't brilliant piece compared to the early track record of Coen Brothers but it's definitely one of the fine attempts of the year representing the meaningless tragedy depicting human absurdity with black humor. Worth a look.",8,1,5,12 November 2008
Quantum of Solace," Letdown of 007
",Now I am seriously not expecting this from 007 film. The movie scored more over negative points than positive ones & its seriously worst recent experience from most awaiting film of the year. Well let me tell you very honestly why I feel sad for this film-# There is no essence in the script required in Bond films # It seems throughout the movie if you keep aside Bond that you are watching some B grade Revenge action drama # M looks helpless & totally out of power in almost every scenes # Movie missed the most expected one-liner- name is BOND # There's no spark in action sequences expected from Bond movies (Casino Royale has several remember initial chase scene) # The film portrayed most unimpressive & ridiculous villain of Bond films & out of sync in his act as well as personality I know I hurt your expectations while writing this but Kya Karen yaarSachchai yahi hai But above all these defects I will give full credits to to Daniel Craig because he is the only Hope & he saved the grace & maintained the dignity of Bond. Just Average entertainer.Ratings- 6/10,6,1,2,8 November 2008
Legends of the Fall," a timeless classic of edward zwick
","The film is a saga of the family consists of three brothers, a father & a lady fighting against all odds tested by time & fate. Set on pastoral background in the period of 1915. Its one of the finest emotional epic journey of family & 3 brothers who loved the same woman. How each time fate played disposing role for Susannah to live as a beloved of all 3 bros with different phases of her life & destiny is a real irony of her life. Its kind of movie which stays with you with some topnotch performances of all lead cast  Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins & Julia Ormond. Pitt has done superb justice to Tristan & it's one of his most memorable role for all Pitt lovers. There are several plus points of film- splendid cinematography, soul stirring background score, wonderfully written dialogues, nice screenplay & most significantly classic climax & end which lefts you with a feeling of watching a finely made film. It's one of the best directed film of Edward Zwick. For All Zwick fans who watched his 'Blood Diamond' & 'Defiance', this is don't miss material. I don't know about the other opinions but I will love to watch it again for its timeless appeal. Recommended.Ratings- 8/10",8,1,3,26 January 2009
Bolt," its awesome animation...
","Bolt is a beginning of new 3D animation franchise by Walt Disney Pictures. And after watching this I must say I will be happy to see the next part as soon as possible.Bolt is Hollywood's hottest television super dog with super power energy. Unknown by fake studio world one day he entered into real world in search of his partner Penny. He befriends with pigeons, black cat & Rhino- the hamster in a transparent ball to accomplish his mission. Infect, it's Rhino an admiring cute character who made Bolt the real super dog & made impossible possible for an ordinary dog & that's what message is. Rhino is full of fun to watch. It's indeed a nice addition in favorite animated characters. It's coolest animation visual treat with well done voice over from John Travolta & Miley Cyrus. Bolt has something for every audience & it absolutely deserved the praise. As per the one-liner for the film, I would like to go with Rhino who frequently uttered- 'Awesome'.Recommended to all animation lovers.Ratings-8/10",8,0,1,17 January 2009
Children of Men," a brilliant future thriller
","Based on the novel of well known writer P.D. James novel the film is a future story of circa 2027. Human race is near to extinction & no child born since last 18 years. The world is in chaos with the concerning issue of infertility & scientists are working on Human Project. The only miracle is a non immigrant pregnant lady & its mission to protect the lady who's the only hope to save the human race.It's surely one of the well maintained intriguing films I've seen from beginning to end without any nonsense subplot. Some of the scoring technical points of the film are- taut screen screenplay & editing, perfect sound editing; brilliant & realistic action sequences & thrill maintained cinematography. Clive Owen has really maintained his character with his best. Julianne Moore has nothing more to represent in her guest appearance kind of role. Michael Caine is always admirable actor & so anything to say about his character is just wasting adjectives.Indeed a superb future thriller & engaging film & all credit go to Director Alfonso Cuaron. It's surely a flawless direction & he has done credible justice to the subject. Watch the climactic scene celebrating humanity where all gunning soldiers paved way to the crying child & the mother among gun trotting chaos. It's like watching literal imagery of Bertrand Russell's great quote- 'In the end only remember the humanity & forget the rest.' Highly Recommended.Ratings- 8/10",8,3,9,26 March 2009
Mystic River," modern Greek Tragedy
","3 childhood friends Jimmy, Dan & Sean drifted apart after a terrible tragedy & grew up in the same city. Destiny pitted them again & it's brutal tragedy again. Jimmy's 19 year old daughter murdered & Dave is the strong suspect. Sean is a cop trying to solve the crime before something unusual done by uncontrollable with situational fix. Its superb script & screen play & I must praise Dennis Lehane for it. But the real laudable act is done by old macho cowboy named Clint Eastwood. This is Clint Eastwood's finest achievement as a director along with his other Oscar winning nuggets like Unforgiven & Million Dollar Baby. With awesome cast & finest performances of Sean Penn, Tim Robbins &Kevin Bacon he shapes a master crime thriller. Pendulum of Brooding thrilling suspense & heightened tension as film is progressing towards climax is just rock solid with awesome performances of Sean Penn & Tim Robbins & both of them got academy trophies for that. Marcia Gay Harden has done amazing justice to her role as psychologically confused wife of Tim Robbins. Must watch if you haven't seen it because this is Modern Greek tragedy.Ratings- 8.5/10",8,1,1,5 December 2008
To Kill a Mockingbird," Gregory Peck at his best...
","It's one of the longest & finest courtroom trial scene of my movie watching experience. Watching the facial expression of that black man named Tom Robinson on trial sitting on the confession chair just melts my emotions deeply. Next to those goddamn natural expressions you witness a mind blowing speech delivered by Gregory Peck as defending lawyer Atticus Finch (It reminds me the great climactic speech delivered by Pacino in 'Scent of Women'). The scene ends with touching standing ovation of all the black men in the court for the white lawyer who's the last man vacating the court & it's a moment where you feel to shout- What a scene!! Based on Harper Lee's classic book the film is a moving story of thirties Southern America. Its classic story of a lawyer with the principles living with his kids & defending a case of a black man named Tom, falsely accused of raping a white woman. Although the jury gave racial verdict in the favor of the white woman & innocent Tom got killed himself in his attempt to escape from cops. There's also fine & equally interesting sub plot in the film between the children & mysterious neighbor Mr. Boo (surprising Robert Duvall).Gregory Peck has played many fine characters but none of them is as rich and as controlled in performance as the character of Atticus Finch- a responsible widower father of two kids & a lawyer with integrity to his profession. His impeccable performance was honored with Best Actor's Oscar for this film. Apart from him the acting by all three kids as non professional actors is really praiseworthy.A Timeless Classic.Ratings-9/10",9,0,1,27 April 2009
The Wrestler," watch out for 'Ram Jam'
","Randy 'The Ram' Robinson is a professional wrestler who had the glorious history 20 years ago. He is now alone, aged & struggling with his bypassed weak heart & advised by Doctor not to wrestle any more. He has only one close friend in form of a stripper. The movie is all about the character study of Randy the wrestler. Mickey Rourke has done superb method act here, same in the league of De'Niro in 'Raging Bull' & gained about 35 pounds of muscle to play Randy & looks like a professional aged wrestler. Rourke remains an under achiever actor for years & worked in lot of B grade films but in this film he faced the camera with striking performance & its worth to watch him. No wonder if get Oscar trophy this year after winning Golden Globe. Although Marisa Tomei displayed lot of nudity here in her stripper role, she very well maintained the dignity of her character.Darren Aronofsky is a director who gave some of the finest character study to cinema created the atmosphere that leaves the audience feeling for old & depressed Rourke's character. Compared to Aronofsky's earlier complex films, this one is plain straight screenplay mainly shot with hand held camera & has a gritty look of watching a documentary drama. The film has certain do not miss scenes- like a moving camera shot on handicap wrestlers struggling to get money through fan following photo sessions or the confession speech of Rourke to his daughter or the climactic scene when he's on ring telling audience his real family. The film is getting popularity & IMDb ranking of 50 is proof of it.Watch it for an underdog actor who finally made it just like his character of the film Randy 'The Ram'.

Defiance," Craig sheds his 007 image....
","Based on true story, Defiance is 1941 drama tells the story of 3 Jew Brothers of Poland, who narrowly escape certain death at the hand of Nazis, vowed to take revenge of their near & dear ones by bringing together their fellow men. It's their aim of life to fight back to the force who is trying to exterminate their race. Survival is their big problem among rough woods, indifferent weather, crisis of food & medicine but they have the biggest weapon with them- Courage. The film is a nice tribute to Jew spirit who fought their struggle with all odds & made history of their race. The film is made by Edward Zwick, who gave films like 'Blood Diamond' & 'The Last Samurai'. Zwick knows very well how to combine action with intense drama & he has maintained justice to it in this film also. One thing I like about Zwick is that he never glorify the action. The action always remained a demand of script in his films. The movie is shot almost in the dense surrounding forest maintaining both engaging action & tense drama between Germans & Jews. The film also portrayed the strength of community bonding under the critical period. It's well made film but the problem with the film is- It does not rise above in theme, plot & screenplay & gave you the feeling of seen it all. Besides the film also fumbles in grip in the later half part. The first time I've seen Daniel Craig in such an intense leading character (shedding his 007 image far behind) with balancing his character at his best. Although the character he played remains inconsistent, he gave it his fair trial. He's finely supported by Liev Schreiber as his high tempered brother who took the side with Russian army.No harm in watching once.Ratings-7/10",7,4,9,15 January 2009
The Silence of the Lambs," Dr Hannibal the Cannibal will stays in memory forever
","Its brilliantly made dark psychological thriller which gave one of the most dangerous character of Hollywood cinema - 'Dr. Hannibal Lecter. The movie is a screen adaptation of best selling novel by the same name written by Thomas Harris. Clarice is FBI trainee goes to interview Dr Hannibal the cannibal to solve the puzzling serial killer Buffalo Bill who skins his victims & keeps them in a pit in his basement. The current captive is US senator's daughter & Dr. Hannibal is the only available clue of the case. Its interplay between Clarice & Dr. Hannibal which made it unsettling thrill ride of 2 hours. As he helps to solve Buffalo Bill case, he digs deep into Clarice's hidden psyche. Every technical aspects of the film are just immaculate & gives you thrill feel from the beginning to end. It's waste of words if I say much about the performances since the film swept the Oscars, winning Best Actor (Anthony Hopkins), Best Actress (Jodie Foster), Best Director (Jonathan Demme), Best Picture, & Best Adapted Screenplay (Ted Tally). This is the third film who won Oscars in all 5 major categories; the other two were- 'It happened one night' & 'One flew over cuckoo's nest'. Hopkins won the Best Actor despite being in the film for about 30 minutes, may be the shortest screen appearance for any best actor winner & that itself proves that Anthony Hopkins has delivered his best in it. I have watched 'Red Dragon' & 'Hannibal' made in the same legacy of this one but after watching this today I must say this will remain matchless classic.Ratings-9/10",9,1,1,1 February 2009
The Deer Hunter," A saga of courage & freindship in Vietnam war
","The movie bagged 5 Academy Awards, including Best Picture (Michael Cimino), Best Actor (Robert De Niro) & Best Supporting Actor (Christopher Walken) in 1978. Its definitely critically acclaimed, extraordinary, powerful film featuring a group of steelworker friends. The story takes turn towards their deer hunting grounds & gradually to lethal Vietnam War. Well the story turns to different trajectory once they signed for Vietnam War. Its compelling drama of friendship & courage among adversity, difference of personality & a shattering emotional experience. The film has strong casting with De Niro, Meryl Streep, John Cazale, & Christopher Walken in memorable roles. The only drawback which I found is its tad 3 hour length & with director's penchant for detail, some time film becomes so slow & boring especially in the first half which is wasted on long wedding ceremony for character development. But the second half is totally absorbing, dark & realistic. Watch out De Niro's mind blowing expressions in the scene on betting gun table where he & Walken were constantly slapped by Vietnamese soldiers or the scene where he ventured 12000 miles away to get Walken & he refused to identify him on gunning table once again. Sure give it one shot.",8,0,1,11 November 2008
Amélie," A Beautiful Movie of the Lifetime
",Have you ever realized that simple joys & pleasures of life lie in trivial details of human beings & not in any mundane thing of worldly pleasure or belongings. Can you believe one person can change your life? Welcome to the innocent & simple life of Amelie. Amelie is not only wonderful film but also amazing character played with such an ease & by Audrey Tautau. Amelie is a cute girl & a waitress living in Paris who loves helping people around her with her own innocent sense of justice & gradually she discovers the love of her life. Its wonderful journey of her life in which she transforms the lives of others but also her own. Amelie is the most wonderful & loving female character on screen I have ever seen till day. While watching I can't stop falling in love with her character & am sure its experience for all those who had already watched it. This is one of the films which will change your life. Watch this beautifully made film (if you haven't) & you will absolutely agree with what I m saying. Simply a Masterpiece of French Cinema.Ratings-10/10,10,2,7,5 November 2008
Ran," Must watch Masterpiece epic
","The movie is a Japanese adaptation of Shakespeare's 'King Lear' from the legendary director Akira Kurosawa. King Hidetora Ichimonji is 70 years old now. Among all of his three sons-Taro, Jiro & Saburo, he chose his eldest son Taro as a successor of his throne & demanded his other two sons to support him. The youngest son Saburo is prankster but the wisest & he isn't happy with this decision & rejected the idea. So the king banished him from the kingdom. And rest lies royal conspiracy, treachery & human tragedy. The movie is maybe the first color film of Kurosawa & rich with detailing cinematography, epic in its scale. It is also technically sound & polished film by Kurosawa. Watch the violent enemy attack tragedy scene inside the castle- a hall of fame of Kurosawa touch. The movie reflects too didactic in its approach. But without doubt its one of darkest drama he had made reflecting his fascination with history of human insanity. I missed Toshiro Miffune in the film - an inseparable part of almost all his masterpiece films. Must watch if you like Kurosawa films.Ratings-8/10",8,0,2,9 November 2008
Sin City," Awesome graphics fixation on screen
","3 creative & original geniuses Director & Graphic Novelist Frank Miller, Ace Cinematographer & Visual effects supervisor Robert Rodriguez & Stylish Screen maverick Quentin Tarantino teamed up together & the result is edgy, racy, stylistic, slick, graphic film. The mesmerizing graphic frame images of the film are so scintillating & wonderfully shot in dark tinted images with sharp contrast of B&W & highlighted flashy digital Colors that you can't stop praising Rodriguez for his creative camera touch & it's really very difficult to judge - who's the real full length director of the film - Tarantino or Miller. Because not only the look of the film (blood gushing graphics) but the rough narration style & the dialogues (read: slangs) gave me the feelings of watching Tarantino flick. The plot is set against a morally bankrupt sin city where cops are corrupt & streets are deadly with goons. Out of three narrations, its Bruce Willis story of an old man & the girl (whom he had saved twice & forever) stays something like a plot in the film. But it's not a plot which is so important here'Oz it's splendid graphic film noire. The movie has pretty glamorous star cast stuffed with Willis, Jessica Alba, Clive Owen & Mickey Rourke. But it's Rourke & Willis' characters who tried hard in their performances.A Must watch Film Noir.Ratings-8/10",8,1,2,28 November 2008
Slumdog Millionaire," film of the year 2008
","The movie has already bagged 4 golden globe trophies & expectations are high to repeat the same history in coming Oscars. More than anyone else I'm happy to see the smiling face of British Director Danny Boyle.He is in his mid 60's & he always remains an underdog low budget filmmaker in Hollywood for years & this is his moment. It's his belief in the script (a novel named 'Q & A' written by Vikas Swarup, which even a few Indians have read so far) & his execution as a director which made the film a history. His best decision as a director is casting an assistant Indian co-director Loveleen Tondon & gave her full liberty of casting. And Loveleen has done brilliant casting to cater the world audience. Especially those slum children including child Jamaal. Apart of sound direction, the movie also scores points in screenplay & gripping editing. Not for a single minute I felt bore in the film.The movie is a moving confession story of a Mumbai slum dweller boy named Jamaal who in the verge of winning a reality quiz show interrogated by the suspicious cops. How Jamaal knows the answers of all questions, how he won 20 million bucks & more importantly his lost love with a platform like this is thing to watch & cherish. The movie is totally Indian in look & partly in Hindi but it's the treatment of balancing fantasy of winning money with stark reality of slum life made it uplifting tale to admire. And it's this balance of film which has touched the right chords of abroad audience.Our 'Madras Mozart' A R Rahman got world recognition on central stage winning golden globe trophy representing 1st ever Indian who won it & it's definitely moment of him too. But the score he gave in the film isn't his best one. All the Indian Rahman fans who have listened his music for years may feel the background score of the film a very normal score compared to his gr8 compositions & themes of last 18 years. Talking about the performances its- Dev Patel & Freida Pinto steals the show with their promising debut performances. Rest of the Bollywood cast- Anil Kapoor, Irrfan Khan, Mahesh Manjrekar or Shaurabh Shukla maintained the nuanced performances assigned to them. But Anil has done exceptionally well with his cheer up anchor of the show with his trademark style. Anil is going to do a thrilling 2nd film with Danny Boyle in lead role. Hope Boyle can exploit well this genius screen legend of Bollywood.Ratings- 8.5/10",9,1,3,13 January 2009
