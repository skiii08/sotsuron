The King's Speech," A Regal Affair
","This is truly an elegant and scrumptious movie! Everything about it feels lavish and luxurious. From the direction, production, acting and everything else! It might seem a bit as a by-the-numbers film, but believe me, it more than makes up with its high pedigree. Colin Firth is really great in his performance and completely deserved the Oscar he so rightfully won. But it is not just him, because he is anchored by a stunning and wonderful supporting cast, from Helena Bonham Carter (who should have also won a Supporting Actress Oscar) to the amazing Jeffrey Rush, Derek Jakobi, Michael Gambon, Guy Pearce and Jennifer Ehle.While I was rooting for David Fincher to win the Oscar for Best Director, I am not sorry that Tom Hooper received it, because he deserved it just as much. Tom Hooper has been a favourite of mine for many years now. He might be best known to North American audiences for his spectacular work for HBO, with the multiple-award winning mini-series 'Elizabeth I' and 'John Adams' as well as TV movies such as 'Longford' and the small movie gem that was 'The Damned United' with Michael Sheen.The same goes for Best Movie Of The Year. I still think that 'The Social Network' should have won, but 'The King's Speech' is a worthy choice also.Beyond all the quirky episodes and soaring moments of the movie, this is at its hear a story about friendship, trust, loyalty and what those ingredients add up to in someone's life, not matter his/her station and/or position in society.If you haven't already done so, do yourself a favour and go see this wonderful movie. These days, when everything seems to be ruled by the lowest common denominator, this movie, 'The King's Speech', stands as an example of what happens when both substance and style stand for something...namely quality!",Null,0,0,8 March 2011
The Avengers," Superhero Collage
","Joss Whedon is a nerd treasure, after having earned his geek street cred with some of the most iconic TV shows and characters around. My favourite of his creations remains 'Firefly', an all-around extraordinary show, at the same time my deep dislike for Fox after the cancellation of said show, also remains intact. It was the popularity of the show and the loyalty of the fans which brought Joss Whedon back with his fond and well deserved closing act (?) to the Firefly saga, in the form of the excellent but oft overlooked 'Serenity'. It was through directing 'Serenity' that Joss Whedon showed that he can easily and comfortably venture beyond TV land and into feature films. His colleague JJ Abrahms (and his gang) also made that same successful leap.It thus came as no great surprise that 'The Avengers' turned out to be such a fun ride, not to mention an insanely profitable one. It speaks to the vision and talent of the man who helmed the project, and what that imagination and talent can do when given the appropriate resources.Whedon managed to take the several superhero movies which served as interconnected instalments or prequels of sorts to this movie, 'Iron Man' 1 and 2, 'The Incredible Hulk' 'Captain America: The First Avenger' and 'Thor', and successfully and quite masterfully bring them all under the umbrella of 'The Avengers', a fitting conclusion (though I'm sure based on the end-credits that a sequel is in the works) to this whole Marvel Universe enterprise.I am not as floored with the movie as the audiences apparently are, but given the number of actors and characters populating the screen, Whedon did an admirable job letting them all share the spotlight, while keeping the story rolling. He was able to imbue the story with enough substance and gravitas so as to prevent the movie from becoming just another unremarkable, brainless, big-budged popcorn dud (yeah, yeah 'John Carter' and 'Battleship' you're what I had in mind) 'The Avengers' does not come close in quality to the quite unfairly overlooked 'X-Men: First Class' (or any of Nolan's Batman flicks), but for what it was meant to be, a summertime season opener, it more than achieved its purpose (and probably set the standard, at least money-wise, too high and potentially out of reach for the other big-budget releases of the summer).If nothing else, I can say I had fun watching 'The Avengers', but with Joss Whedon at the wheel you do get something extra in terms of quality over quantity.Bravo Whedon! I'm looking forward to you spreading your wings even further.",Null,3,7,7 June 2012
Blade Runner 2049," How tedious and boring...please stop!
","Saw this movie last night...and boy was it a tedious, overly long watch! This movie felt like having to do overtime at work. Dennis Villeneuve is a terrific director, loved 'Sicario' and 'Arrival', but this was a misfire in every possible way.An uninteresting story, the script is just muddled, highly convenient and disappointingly pedestrian. While the first movie retained, despite notable differences, the spirit and essence of Phillip K. Dick's amazing novel 'Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep', 'Blade Runner 2049' is at best an outlier, the story having been diluted to nothingness. Ryan Gosling is completely miscast in the role, as I knew he would, the guy just doesn't cut it. Harrison Ford just looked bored, bored with acting and bored having to revisit these characters he clearly doesn't want to but for the paycheque. Much like he was in 'The Force Awakens'.The problem is that Ford gets paid to look bored, whereas I have to pay to watch him looking bored. Maybe retirement is in order.Jared Leto is just awful and does nothing but look menacing or foreboding, the only expressions he seems capable of, either in the movies or music videos he makes. I am not exactly sure how and why this guy continues to be cast in anything these days.Losing Johann Johansson as the composer for the soundtrack was also big mistake. Hans Zimmer is usually a good, reliable, composer but when he misses, he misses big. The score is terrible. It's just noise...heavy, loud noise and when it isn't, it sounds like what would have happened if the soundtrack for 'Inception' and Vangelis's original score for'Blade Runner' had a baby.The use of 3D is also completely useless here and I think, it detracts from the movie and it's visual narrative. The visuals and special effects everybody seems to be applauding, were, I found, lost in an unnecessary murkiness and annoying, orange tinged twilight.Roger Deakin is one of the best cinematographers ever, and for example there were some shots in 'Sicario' which took my breath away, not so in this movie. He missed the mark here. In 'Blade Runner 2049', never for a moment did I experience the feeling of awe I did, and still do, when I watched the original, especially the opening scene. (Do a search on Syd Mead and then you will know why the original 'Blade Runner' looked and felt the way it did.)The bit towards the end with Rachel and the use of the character and employment of the technology came off as cheap and an unnecessary add-on. Something like that worked very well in 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story', here it doesn't. It is not an awful movie, or one of those 'the worst I've seen' types, but it cannot hold a candle to the original on any account. It is too long, too boring for long stretches and in the end it just left me with a headache as well as mostly indifferent.I never wanted a sequel for 'Blade Runner' and 'Blade Runner 2049' proves why.",Null,28,60,6 October 2017
Black Swan," Am I crazy...or not!?
","'Black Swan' is one of the most effective movies dealing with issues of and about mental health I have seen. It is so effective because it does not directly deal with that subject matter, instead wrapping itself in a surreal and hypnotic environment, where its main character flounders between reality and paranoia, with the line between both blurry at best and none-existent at worst.When watching this movie, one can cut the tension with a knife. It is as palpable as anything in the movie. It is also one of the reasons why I think the film is not a candidate for repeat viewings. Not for me at least, not anytime soon.However, the movie is truly an excellent piece of cinema. Darren Aronofsky is once again brilliant, a fact which seems to have escaped the Academy this time around, just as it did with 'The Wrestler'.Natalie Portman is supreme in the movie, and deserved every bit of the critical acclaim and success she has garnered, including the Oscar itself, she was that good. I am glad the got recognized for her work, unlike Mickey Rourke, who last year got completely railroaded from his Oscar, an award he definitely deserved, as his was an astounding performance, one that Aronofsky is very capable of getting out of his actors. I am glad on this occasion it worked for Natalie Portman.Mila Kunis, Barbara Hershey, Vincent Casell and Winona Ryder are all great in the movie and were a treat to see.But ultimately this movie belongs to Darren Aronofsky and Natalie Portman, a creator and his muse.",Null,2,4,11 March 2011
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," How I finally killed Jar Jar Binx...
","I know, I know...writing a review for a movie which came out in 1999, one I already own on DVD and have seen dozens of times, yet still went to watch on the big screen when it was released in 3D...makes me a special kind of looser...I feel like Bobba Fett's mentally challenged cousin, Retardo Fett! What can I say, I have no excuse, I truly am George Lucas's b*tch! I can just see him laughing all the way to the bank, as he shoves his lightsaber up my bunghole while I fork over my non-existent paycheck...such is the life of nerds folks! Normal people (by which I mean, people with a life, a purpose etc.) would never commit such an atrocious capitulation of reason and sense as me. Alas, the only thing I can say in my defence is that I am truly a nerd of epic proportions! Now, all kidding aside, unlike many others, I liked the prequel trilogy warts and all. I never thought them to be a letdown as others have. That includes 'Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace'.Even though more than a decade has passed since the original release of 'The Phantom Menace', the movie did not look shabby at all. The special effects hold up very well, the CGI does not look dated and John William's soundtrack is as great as ever. Acting wise the cast was none too weak, with a few exceptions of course. The soul of the movie for me continues to be Liam Neeson's noble Qui Gon Jin, such a distinguished, honourable and principled character, a true embodiment of the Jedy Knights. The other acting strengths of the movie are Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan Kenobi and Ian McDiarmid as chancellor Palpatine. Ray Parker makes for a memorable villain as Darth Maul.As for the 3D it works remarkably well, the pod race sequence and what has become known as 'The Duel Of The Fates' between Qui Gon Jin, Obi Wan and Darth Maul alone are worth the price of admission. They looked great even before, but the 3D actually works in their favour adding more depth and quality (one of the rare instances when 3D did not annoy me or proved useless).The icing on the cake for me though...was the fact that through the miracle of 3D I could finally reach out to the screen and strangle Jar Jar Binx with my bare hands, watching as he became no more than a heap of thrash...ahem, I mean at least in my imagination...All righty then...that's all folks!",Null,6,10,14 February 2012
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Should Have And Could Have!
","Yep, I did enjoy parts of this movie, which makes its viewing all the more maddening! I liked the narration a lot, especially Lincoln's words about the nature of life, remembrance, history and what people choose to believe or not believe. That was a fantastic set-up for what should have been one of the more original movies of this summer! Unfortunately the movie proved to be soo unequal in its nature and content, in that it resembled watching a car wreck unfolding before your very eyes. I liked most of the cast, the acting was non-too-shabby, and the story, ah the story, it made for an interesting premise.But the movie veers in and out of reason, continuity and even clarity. Sometimes the characters say and do things, and I cannot really understand how they got to that point or when the story shifted.Like the Twilight vampires, these vampires can also walk in daylight, and lo and behold join the Confederate cause-celebre, slavery, though the vampires don't want slaves to cook their food, they want them to be their food...which puts an interesting slant on the whole bloody episode that was the Civil War. The vamps in this movie resemble a bunch of southern dandies, bored out of their skulls by the many years of a meaningless existence...oh yeah and apparently they also don't heal fast, can't glamour anyone etc...their superhuman abilities seem to manifest themselves in some instances, in others they seem to mysteriously vanish...If I had to choose, I prefer the vampires from 'True Blood', 'Interview With A Vampire', 'Blade' and even 'Underworld', those are the ones I know and am more familiar with.The vampire trend has netted some interesting projects, ranging from good to just plain awful.'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' falls somewhere in-between, as does its equally disappointing compadre from before 'Priest'...I really wish this was a more positive review, because there are things to like in this movie, which perhaps under the hand of a more able director, could have been (and should have been) a much better movie!",Null,3,6,25 June 2012
A Star Is Born," A Star Is Reborn
","Just saw the movie. As good as advertised and better. Gaga and Cooper have crazy chemistry, these two belong together...no doubt.The cast is excellent to the last. Sam Elliott, Dave Chapelle, Andrew Dice Clay etc. No weak links here.The amazing music ties it all, and what music it is! Well worth listening again and again.As a director Cooper made it all flow soo naturally and without anything feeling forced and artificial.As for Lady Gaga, the best I can say, she is transcendental in her role. She is a revelation, even though she's already been in the public eye for a decade or so. Watching this movie is like rediscovering Lady Gaga all over again. And if there ever was any doubt about her talent and range...this movie should put all that to rest. Lady Gaga is the closest we have to a modern day Renaissance woman...I'm soo glad I saw this movie. In these dark days we are living through, 'A Star Is Born' is a balm on an open wound.10 out of 10",Null,13,27,5 October 2018
Gravity," How Sandra Bullock killed Gravity...
","Over a decade ago, I was lucky enough to catch this movie called 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' (roughly translated '...And Also Your Mother') by this up and coming Mexican director, Alfonso Cuaron. Needless to say that that movie's brilliance put Cuaron on my list of directors whose movies are a must see.Few directors names alone compel me to see a movie of theirs, but Cuaron is one of those few. Over the intervening years there has been a rebirth and resurgence of sorts in Latin American cinema, and Cuaron had a lot to do with that. Plus, Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna were really brought to the forefront by Cuaron...and that is not bad in my book!I followed Cuaron ever since and have thoroughly enjoyed his movies. Among them, 'Harry Potter And The Prizoner Of Azkaban', which remains, for me at least, the best entry in the Potter franchise (I wish he had directed more of them), and the absolutely brilliant and stunning 'Children Of Men'.So it was with great anticipation that I went to see 'Gravity'. Boy, oh boy, did that anticipation ever crash and burn! I was not prepared for what transpired, and the feeling of frustration I experienced as a movie fan.Let me say at the outset, that 'Gravity' is an achievement in technical and visual terms. There are some shots in there that are absolutely stunning and incredible. The film is just beautiful to look at, the effects are just as excellent and the 3D really works and is not simply an add-on as is the case in soo many other big-budget counterparts (the last movie I've seen 3D used in such an efficient manner was 'Dredd').'Gravity' is nothing new under the sun story-wise. A space mission gone awry and the fight for survival which ensues in the aftermath of the catastrophic event which causes said failure. The characters are also nothing to write home about. So all in all, a formulaic tale populated with formulaic leads, yet still a compelling and interesting premise.George Clooney has a pretty limited engagement in the movie so he is NOT critical mass......and then there was Sandra Bullock. Sandra Bullock has to be one of the most mediocre and over-hyped actresses I have seen. She gets by on excuses and allowances that people make for her, which they shouldn't. Her Oscar win in 'The Blind Side', though the Oscars are becoming more and more irrelevant with each passing year, was unwarranted and awarded truly more on the basis of 'oh well she is America's sweetheart, paid her dues, so this is as good an opportunity as any'. But I digress...I sat watching with stunned disbelief at how she managed to take apart the movie and really destroy it! Whatever Cuaron achieved as a director, was undone by Bullock's terrible, sub-par performance. This movie is proof positive that casting is truly important, and that it can make or break a film. In this case it broke it! Not only is Bullock not able to carry the movie, she diminishes it. I know this might not be the most popular take on this flick and Bullock herself, I am only writing what I felt as a movie fan while watching 'Gravity'. The movie literally consists of almost two hours of Sandra Bullock getting tangled, tossed around, floating and bumping into things, all accentuated by her obnoxious, whinny, nasal and anal retentive voice.If that is your cup of tea, then you'll think that the movie is the greatest thing since sliced bread! For me this film was a downer, especially considering how much I was looking forward seeing it! I can only imagine what it would have been like had another actress been cast...So, in conclusion, I gave this movie 3 out of 10, not because of Cuaron's direction, or the movie's technical and visual aspects or production values. I did so because Sandra Bullock literally killed 'Gravity' with her performance!",Null,14,30,5 October 2013
Captain Marvel," Captain Marvel....oh boy...
","So I saw the movie. Let's cut through the chase. It's flat, boring and really, really underwhelming. Basically a typical superhero movie. It's only advantage is that it's not too long.Brie Larson is soo unremarkable and boring she literally puts you to sleep with one look, which I guess is a superpower. Wrong choice as a lead. I think Katee Sackhoff would have been a way better choice.Not that the rest of the cast is anything to write home about. Sam Jackson aka 'They Only Call Me Fury' ...is basically reduced to a bumbling buffoon sidekick and bad comic relief. It was good to see Phil Coulson with hair...The 90's nostalgia was one long vintage product ad. I actually lived throughout that entire decade and it had its share of good as well as bad things. The nostalgia in this movie is understandably presented lovingly through rose coloured lenses...the reality
was far from that. Not that I necessarily expected that from the movie. But it is pretty annoying when it is played soo obviously to score points with the audience.Oh and the humour throughout is cringeworthy, badly timed and feels like a lowbrow class of improv comedy.All the controversy about this movie having this message or that message or about what Brie Larson said or didn't say. No worries. It's all being blown out of proportion. The movie has no message, NONE. Except the usual tired drivel you get in this genre. The
only virtue this movie espoused is the dollars Disney is banking through Marvel.The whole movie feels like an extended TV episode and sadly a wasted opportunity to do something way better than this. The direction looks like amateur hour in terms of the skills of its two, read TWO, directors.Oh...and I am not a fan of the cat...especially since it is the reason Nick Fury loses his eye, which is itself pretty ridiculous...The end credit scenes are worthless and mean nothing to me as I've pretty much given up on superhero movies and haven't followed the MCU for about two years...so I got no skin in the game so to speak.What I can't decide is at this time, is whether this is better or worse than 'Wonder Woman' ...4 out of 10",Null,11,16,27 March 2019
This Is the End," It Better Be The End!
","An average comedy, in the honoured tradition we have come to expect from all the Judd Appatow alumni! The movie is short on plot, as other have pointed out, but it does really contain some funny, funny highlights.At times the movie lags somewhat, but it has enough good bits to make up for those moments. The cast, well it isn't really a cast since the actors play themselves (and with themselves) in the movie!!! I sincerely hope that these are just more exaggerated versions of their real selves, because boy, if these guys are like that in real life they would be quite insufferable.There are some eye opening cameos that really contribute to this movie's surreal and weird vibe, but that is not necessarily bad. There is however one cameo in particular that works to great effect, besides being really f **king hilarious. I'll let you guess which one that is! You don't have to be part and parcel of the Appatow universe to get this movie, but if you are you will understand some of the references made during the movie better and perhaps some of the 'in' jokes the cast pokes at itself.I think that with this flick Seth Rogen and his buddies have come to the realization that this sub-genre of male angst/insecurity driven comedy has run its course, and that they themselves, as it is acknowledged in the movie, have grown and changed beyond the personas they have portrayed in their other movies. It is time to move on! But in the meantime, there is no reason not to go out with a bang! So if you want to see what the end of the world would look like in Hollywood(and who gets to go to heaven and hell), the largest penis ever put on screen and Michael Cera as you've never seen him before, well then this is the movie for you! IF you are going to end something, might as well do it in style!",Null,3,18,12 June 2013
World War Z," A good surprise!
","'World War Z' was a really good surprise for me as a moviegoer. As everyone else, I had heard about all the in-fighting, re- shoots and other problems that plagued the production.All I have to say is that I am glad the movie was made. True, it has little semblance to Max Brook's novel other than the premise and some characters, but that might have been for the best. Also, finding out what the original 'third act' and ending of the movie was going to be, I'm sure glad they changed it, it would have been horrible had they kept it! After being bombarded with prequels and sequels all summer long, it was refreshing to see an original story being brought to the screen. Honestly I went in not knowing what to expect. The trailers had been pretty effective and I had some anticipation wanting to see the movie, but they were tempered by all the bad publicity this movie got before its release. I left after the screening having been pleasantly surprised. I liked it more than I thought I would, and in a year populated with so many mediocre and outright disappointing movies, 'World War Z' was a most welcome change to that annoying pattern.Now they have a good director to continue this budding franchise. If done properly, this should be a solid series of movies. Juan Antonio Bayona is a good director. I have seen 'The Orphanage' and it is a good little movie, done for next to nothing in terms of budget, but very a very effective supernatural thriller. I have not seen 'The Impossible', but the movie garnered positive reviews by enlarge and was fairly successful at the box office.I am looking forward to the next instalment of 'World War Z'.",Null,1,2,25 December 2013
The Hunger Games," Vampires Suck A** And Sparkle!
","'The Hunger Games' is a promising beginning in what looks to be, hopefully, another successful movie franchise and a most welcome antidote to the dreadful 'Twilight' movies...This opening salvo works on all cylinders. A good job was done by all parties involved given the movie's modest (by today's standards) budget. Donald Sutherland, Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz and Woody Harrelson round-up a good cast.Jennifer Lawrence though, truly is the centre piece of this movie. Without her in the lead role, I doubt that the movie would have been as good as it ended up being.I have not read the books, so this review is solely based on the movie itself. I found it strange that a lot of people bring up 'Battle Royale' as the movie they most compare 'The Hunger Games' with, but fail to also bring up George Orwell's novel '1984' or Aldous Huxley's 'Brave New World'. I rather think that 'The Hunger Games' has undertones of those stories, and that is a positive thing! Based on this first instalment, I will be in the theatre when the next chapter comes to the big-screen. I am not a huge fan, or an established one, since I have not read the books, but as a moviegoer, I was not disappointed!",Null,5,6,10 May 2012
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," An average fare...
","I found this movie to be average at best. Sure when compared with some of the garbage that came out on the big screen this past year, it is better, but that is not saying much. I expected more from this movie and instead got a completely forgettable film. There was one noteworthy performance in the movie, its only bright spot actually, and that was Tilda Swinton and her turn as the White Witch. The rest of the movie, from the acting to the special effects is utterly unremarkable and I would venture to say even second class. I cannot judge this movie as it relates to the books, since I have not read them (nor do they hold much interest to me personally). But if I have to sum up my feelings about it all, as I have said in the header, it was an average fare...",Null,0,5,26 December 2005
The Secret in Their Eyes," The Love In Their Eyes...
","'The Secret In Their Eyes' or 'El Secreto De Sus Ojos', is yet another fine example of the wonderful movie scene which has developed and grown at such a seemingly rapid pace in Latin America.The past few decades has seen some excellent movies, some true masterpieces, come out of Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Argentina and other of the countries comprising Central and South America. We saw the rise of new directors, actors and actresses that are now counted among the top in the world. Spain of course, continues its stalwart delivery of great movies from the seemingly eternal Almodovar and a crop of new and talented directors.'The Secret In Their Eyes' is yet another worthy addition to that impressive roster. The director Juan Jose Campanella, actors Ricardo Darin(Benjamin Esposito), Soledad Villamil (Irene Menendez-Hastings), Pablo Rago (Ricardo Morales) as well as the rest of the cast and crew that made this movie possible, prove once again that you don't really need a large budget (according to IMDb, this movie's budget is pegged at some $2mil.), super duper special effects, big explosions and frenetic action scenes to have a movie that engages its audiences.Good storytelling, great characters, amazing performances and many other basic ingredients, can render such an amazing movie as 'The Secret In Their Eyes' a reality not just a memory of some supposed faded and fallen Golden Age of movies! This is proof positive that there are good movies outhere to be seen, and good people providing them...the trick is to get them the exposure they need and deserve and then make our impressions and desires known with our wallets. I often say that we get the movies we ask for! IF all we want is a constant dose of mind-numbing drone-like movies made and assembled at the fast-food line of cheap and easy thrills, well that is what we will get! The movie is at turns, sad, melancholic, beautiful, terrifying and haunting. It is a film that once seen truly impresses itself on its viewers and leaves a clear mark of interest, pleasure and a reminder of why we do go to see movies and what it is about them that can be so fascinating and engaging! I won't bother spoiling any aspect of the movie for those who have not yet seen it, because I truly want people to give this movie a chance, take their time, be patient and really get into it. Do not be discouraged by the subtitles, they do not affect the kinetic energy that this movie creates and maintains throughout. Even if you are not a Spanish speaker, like myself, you will not loose anything from the potency of the movie, so do not be discouraged by subtitles! Besides I would say that the most important and touching moments in the movie are when there is no dialogue at all! It all resides in their faces, in their expressions, but above all in their eyes, eyes which can convey so much with so little!",Null,0,1,27 October 2010
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," The Spymaster...
","'Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy' is an old-fashioned but solid and well made spy thriller. This is more in the vain of movies like 'The Spy Who Came In From The Cold', 'The Odessa Files' etc.I was thinking of any movies I've seen in recent years which would be in the same category and what came to mind was 'The Good Sheppard' (Robert De Niro's solid directorial effort) and even 'The Constant Gardener'.It boasts an all star cast comprising of such notables as Colin Firth, Toby Jones, John Hurt, Mark Strong and Ciaran Hinds with a singularly brilliant and astonishing performance by Garry Oldman (even those tightwads over at the Oscars seem to agree since they nominated him for a Best Actor award). If there is any justice left in the world...Garry Oldman should hands down win the statuette for Best Actor! For those looking for an action packed flick, this is not it, no James Bond or Salt to be found here. While I enjoy the Bourne movies, this is not it either. On the other hand, if you want an intelligent film which asks its audiences to pay attention to, and participate in the story, not only on a visceral and emotional level, but also a mental and intellectual one, I would recommend 'Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy' to you.",Null,2,4,25 January 2012
"I, Tonya"," I, Tonya, Everybody's Favourite Punching Bag
","The strength and crushing poignancy of 'I, Tonya' is what lies beneath the perceived pedigree and nature of the movie. It is as much a dark comedy and fictionalized biography, as it is something else, something more, much more. It is the sad and heartbreaking portrait of a deeply flawed and imperfect individual, who got caught in events that went way beyond her and her perceived or actual guilt. It is the story of a human being screaming for help, in need of love and support, being ignored and overlooked at every stage of her strange, hard and often unforgiving existence. It is the story of a woman that was abused and brutalized while everyone, including the people that could and should have helped her, looked away and pretended it wasn't happening. It is the story of someone who was rejected and stepped on because she didn't fit with our idea of what a sympathetic character should be and look like.Whatever Tonya Harding achieved in her life came through sheer will and yes, hard work. She also made mistakes, made a mess of things and failed often. What a human being should be allowed to do in life with the ramifications and consequences which come from that.Ultimately this movie is an indictment of us as a whole, as a society, who turned on her and made her our distraction, a punchline to a sad and pathetic joke, exposing her to an unyielding torrent of cruelty and harshness. We cast the first stone and never looked back. Tonya Harding became everybody's favourite punching bag (pun intended), hung out to dry, transformed into the thing we most hate about ourselves, projected onto this one person. All of this is wonderfully brought to life by Margot Robbie in a sublime performance, seconded most wonderfully by Alison Janney and Sebastian Stan. A well directed, acted, written and produced movie. 'I Tonya' is not perfect, but it is an eye opener and in these troubled days that is saying something.",Null,1,2,24 January 2018
Pan's Labyrinth," A fantasy feast!
","I went to see this movie without knowing much about it, and not expecting anything special. Boy was I wrong! I had heard that it was getting good reviews and had won some international awards, but that did not prepare me for what I eventually ended up seeing.First let me make one thing clear, THIS IS NOT A MOVIE FOR CHILDREN! Do not be fooled by the poster or the title, or the fact that this is a fantasy movie. This is a fantasy movie unlike I have seen in many years. It is dark, brooding, violent, disturbing, sad, touching and heartbreaking. Indeed a fantasy film for mature audiences, with none of the Disney-type cute creatures or funny sidekicks! Guillermo del Toro is quickly solidifying his reputation as an outstanding director, and one of the most original around for sure! Together with Alejandro Gonzales Inaritu and Alfonso Cuaron (and even Robert Rodriguez he is actually Mexican-American born in the US) and of course Pedro Almodovar he gives such a high and well deserved profile for the cinematic talent coming out of Latin America! For years these and other directors were a kind of hidden treasures but now with the phenomenal success of their movies, they have joined the ranks of the great directors of this world. This bodes well I think for international cinema, as Latin America is hardly the only region to produce excellent directors, amazing actors and very very good movies. These days the most original and unique movies are usually independent and in many cases outside Hollywood.'Pan's Labyrinth/El Laberinto del Fauno' is one of those rare movies that manages to thrill, move, and leave an indelible impression upon its audience. The directing, acting and special effects are of the highest quality. The movie is visually stunning and contains some imagery that I won't soon forget.The movie leaves one a lot to think about and ponder. The best I could compare this movie with is the magical realism of Jorge Luis Borges or Gabriel Garcia Marquez some of the premier writers to come out Latin America.I can't think of a better movie to see this season.

","Let's be honest a lot of men would at that...and also let's be honest about the fact that at one point in time we have all worked for or at least encountered in the workplace the 'horrible bosses' of this movie's name sake. Case-in-point, myself...12 years in my job and invariably I have seen some form or incarnation of the portraits painted of the bosses, supervisors and co-workers in this hilarious comedy! 'Horrible Bosses' evokes a lot of the same feelings I had when I watched the now comedy classic 'Office Space' and its more subdued but still good companion 'Extract'. I mean this as a compliment. It just killed me at how accurate a view of the people which populate an office or any other work setting, those movies captured. 'Horrible Bosses' easily accomplishes that same threshold.Sure, the nastiness of the antagonists is exaggerated and inflated, but the kernel of truth upon which it is based is unmistakable! The cast is remarkable Jason Bateman and Jason Sudeikis are solid, but to me Charlie Day reserves the biggest portion of the laughs! He feels really oppressed and abused, a feeling that is amplified by his companions' outright dismissal of his plight at the hands of the nutty and crazy Julia, his boss (and one of the sexiest dentists I have ever seen...). He is a man that has been constantly walked over, mistreated and seen as a weakling and push-over, especially as he says because his goal in life has always been to 'be a husband'.The movie's quality would have been seriously hampered had the supporting cast been any less. Just seeing Colin Farrell's visage in front of my eyes solicits laughs, his entire appearance and demeanour is prime rate, and one can tell that he had a lot of fun with his character. Kevin Spacey, well he is Kevin Spacey, always top-notch, and here thankfully channelling some of the maniacal streak he displayed in 'Swimming With The Sharks' another seminal take on workplace torture and enslavement...LOL! Jennifer Aniston in this movie, is the Jennifer Aniston I would like to see more of in other movies. She is ballsy, crazy, demanding, weird, nasty, explicit and really, really horny, which makes for a hilarious character! Instead of doing all the mindless and pointless romantic comedies she has made recently, she should perhaps focus more on these off-kilter roles, because they suit her, again I don't mean this as an insult! Her turn in 'Horrible Bosses' was as good or perhaps better than Cameron Diaz's as the pot-smoking, sex-crazed, foul-mouthed teacher in 'Bad Teacher'.All in all a good comedy to go along with 'Bad Teacher' and 'Bridesmaids, and an over-all relief from the drone-like-assembly-line feel of the Summer box office.",Null,0,0,18 July 2011
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain Dudley-Do-Right!
","I remember when back in the 90's I went to see 'Independence Day'...I was impressed to say the least, with the movie's scope and special effects...Yeah, those were the days! Remember them? When movies about aliens and natural disasters were all the rage! Those formula movies appeared to be box-office proof...assured cinematic gold! Under the category of 'Where Are They Now?'...well now they are the SyFy produced movies of the week! And this is were Marvel and the whole superhero genre is heading, though at this point in time it might appear impossible!'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' is not technically a bad movie, hence the 7 out of 10 rating. What has changed, for me personally, as a movie-goer, is the fact that I have reached saturation point with these genre movies.Superhero movies are not a new venture by any means, yet for a long while they lay dormant with only scant and often appalling examples coming out in movie cineplexes around the world.When back in the early 2000's they started trickling back in, I was at once excited and hopeful, so many interesting characters, so many interesting stories to tell. But as time passed, the trickle became a flood and now everywhere you turn, there is some franchise, sequel, prequel, re-boot, re-boot of a re-boot, all under this large tent-pole of the superhero genre, and Marvel is clearly the standard bearer when it comes to this cinematic universe we seem to be stuck in.And while at this point it seems highly unlikely, as the latest offering('Captain America: The Winter Soldier') from this all-you-can eat cinematic buffet has proved , Marvel and its superheroes do run the risk of going the way of the dodo bird...All it takes is one or two gigantic missteps or outright failures for this house of cards to come down. Since these movies and their budgets are increasing at an exponentially ridiculous rate (I mean a quarter of a billion dollars?!?!?!?), a few duds could literally push a movie- studio out of business, or at the very least seriously cramp their style! As I said, not a bad movie, but the end, as far as I can see it, is nigh...the point of saturation is impending. It is no longer a matter of how, but a question of when? And given the fact that the movie industry seems to have largely abandoned original ideas and projects, and has come to rely so heavily on these large franchise/sequel type of movies (yes, YA- Young Adults included)...when they collapse the movie-wasteland they could leave in their wake may be tremendous!",Null,0,2,22 April 2014
Doctor Strange," Strange indeed...
","Speaking as a civilian here, (read neither a Marvel or DC fanboy), I have never personally been a fan of the Marvel movies. Sure I enjoyed some a bit here or there, but in terms of their offerings, I always thought Marvel excelled in their TV series rather than their movies. I actually thought that Marvel's collaboration with Netflix is where their strength was, in that shows like 'Daredevil', 'Jessica Jones' and 'Luke Cage' changed what the superhero genre could and should be, and what a fan could and should expect from it.'Doctor Strange' marks the first time for me, when I was actually looking forward to a Marvel movie. And this time with good reason. I was surely not disappointed and them some! I had a lot of fun watching 'Doctor Strange', which is why you go to movies in the first place. It was a solid movie, well made, great cast, with truly excellent visual effects and action set pieces. So it totally deserves the success it's getting. It is also a very well calibrated movie and at around 115 minutes, its running time is the perfect length. A big round of applause for Benedict Cumberbatch who steals the show (even thought the show is his) and every frame he is in, as well as Tilda Swinton, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Mads Mikkelsen, Benedict Wong and Rachel McAdams.There are many things that you might forgive and overlook while watching a genre movie, but one of the things that absolutely cannot be forgiven, is if said movie is tedious and boring. At no point did I experience that with 'Doctor Strange'!",Null,3,8,5 November 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Pain out of loss, love out of grief...
","Amidst the oppressive noise level of heavily formed but largely empty and meaningless clunkers like the two behemoths currently bloating out the screens at multiplexes, 'Thor: Ragnarok' and 'Justice League' , if you look carefully, you can still find some cinematic gems here and there. Such as 'Three Bilboards outside Ebbing, Missouri'A movie born out of the pain and sorrow brought on by incomprehensible and tragic loss, seething anger at the injustice in this world and the injuries inflicted by life, wounds that never really heal, because they are not physical but exist only in the soul.The scar-tissue which forms from that can birth something both wonderful and simultaneously terrifying. The cast is exquisite, the story powerful and poignant and the movie as a whole is an affirmation of what it is to be human and live through it day after day. The balance of tragedy and humour is brilliant, because they both make sense as fellow travellers. If misery loves company, then this movie also proves that it loves comedy. Characters you think you have pegged as an overwrought and exaggerated stereotype turn out to be anything but. Easily one of the best movies of the year.Do yourselves a favour and forgo the fast- food, zero calories spectacles and give this movie a chance. You may be reminded that movies can have substance and stand for something, especially during these dark days we are traversing.",Null,4,7,21 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," An underwhelming conclusion to a horrible trilogy!
","'The Rise Of Skywalker' is a final slap in the face of the 'Star Wars' fandom ( well parts of it anyways). A parting insult, that in a way couldn't have come soon enough. Good riddance!There had been over the past few years talk about the franchise being overexposed and of fans growing tired. But the reason 'Star Wars' fatigue was (and still is to some extent) setting in is because of the moronic content and idiotic characters that flooded the franchise with the dismal Disney Trilogy.'The Rise Of Skywalker', the latest example of that, is a horrible mixture of mediocre storytelling and subpar, underdeveloped characters, engulfed in an unrelenting cacophony of special effects and all encompassing visual onslaught, meant to distract from the barebones nature of the movie. It's a schizophrenic conclusion to one of the worst movie trilogies in recent years, one that managed to diminish and also partly destroy the original saga.Pretending these movies don't exist is the next best and most accessible cure for all those people who have become alienated from 'Star Wars' . We just have to see what the long-term solution will be... if any is even available anymore...1 out of 10",Null,12,18,2 January 2020
Burn After Reading," Nonsense
","What happens when the world you live in no longer makes any sense? What happens when your own life no longer makes sense and looses its meaning? What happens in a world inhabited by people that are so alienated from one another, so self-absorbed in their own little private worlds, that they are totally disconnected, a world where people no longer communicate with one another, notice I did not say miscommunicate for that still implies a kind of communication, albeit erroneous, any kind of direct, face-to-face communication? Well, what happens is a ridiculous and absurd chain of events which makes up 'Burn After Reading', a comedy of circumstance, or as I would like to call it a thinking-man's screwball comedy. The cast is really great and dead on, with a deliciously frustrated and raging John Malkovitch, a pretty-boy meat-head Brad Pitt, a paranoid-philanderer George Clooney, a self-obsessed basket-case Frances McDormand, a decent-yet-too negative-and-self-restrained Richard Jenkins, a cold-stuck-up bitch Tilda Swinton and a permanently s*it-faced J.K. Simmons.'Burn After Reading' is one of the best movies I have seen so far this year (and there haven't been many of those), and quite a successful comeback for the Cohen brothers after their last great piece 'No Country For Old Men'. This is the Cohen Brothers on their lighter side, when I mean lighter side, I mean that in as far as the Cohens go, you make your own deduction from that! So Cohen brothers fans fret not for this is not 'Intolerable Cruelty' or 'O Brother Where Art Thou'. 'Burn After Reading' is more in the vein of 'The Big Lebowsky' or 'Barton Fink', with a bit more realism if I may say so.The saying goes 'No man is an island', well in this movie the world portrayed is full of little islands, islands drifting apart rather than together. In hindsight, I think this film has more in common, or at lest shares some common threads with Sam Mendes's 'American Beauty' than even with previous Cohen comedies...perhaps, perhaps not, at least that is just my own worthless opinion.Coldplay had a song on their album, 'Parachutes', I cannot remember what track it was, either 'Don't Panic' or 'Troubles', where one line goes something like 'We've been living in a bubble', well watch this movie and see what you make of it.",Null,4,9,17 September 2008

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," The Deathly Hallows Part 1...so far...
","Not the strongest beginning to the end of the Potter franchise, I must admit! Yates is not who I imagined, would handle this one...but alas there it is, it's done! There were a few issues I had with the movie itself...The cast is great as always, and never thought they took away anything from the movie however...Yeah...the editing is not this movie's strong suit...among other things. It was good, but I am still of the belief that for the end movie they should have sought the services of another director. David Yates is a competent director, but he just that, I don't see any imagination on his part, no originality, he is able to deliver a competent visual version of the story, but that is where everything stops.Personally, I would have wanted to see Alfonso Cuaron return at the helm of the franchise. 'Harry Potter And The Prizoner Of Azkaban' remains my favourite of the entire franchise, followed closely by Mike Newel's 'Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire'.Don't get me wrong, it is still a good movie, but I don't know how to put it in words, its as if the magic is lacking from the movie...its as if the film is in an odd way flat and subdued...even Chris Columbus got that part right... I also expected more from Alexander Desplat (he did a wonderful job with 'Syrianna') in the soundtrack department, it is though, after the fourth movie they just stopped caring about the music, which is so important to the movie franchise.A 7 out of 10 for now, but I must stress this, I cannot fully grade the movie until I have seen the second part, only then, when I have seen the movie in its entirety will I give a final rating...Oh well I'll wait until next July!!!!

Silver Linings Playbook," Excelsior...er....er.....er!
","After the solid effort that was 'The Fighter', I was curious to see how director David O. Russell would follow up that wonderful film. His answer the 'Silver Linings Playbook' an able, solid and catchy effort.At its heart, 'Silver Linings Playbook' is a love story, wrapped in a layer of mental and emotional distress, a dysfunctional but loving family, dancing, gambling and American football.Sound complicated? Sound convoluted! It might appear so at the beginning, but once the movie gets going, the going is good, and David O. Russel deftly juggles all the aspects of this wonderful film as well as a highly talented cast, including Robert De Niro who's in fine form once more, Jackie Weaver, Bradley Cooper, Chris Tucker, Julia Stiles and John Ortiz.For me, the heart of the movie is Jennifer Lawrence, whose honest and heartbreaking performance really uplifts the film. This very award deserving performance really becomes the common thread of this movie. To understand what I mean by that, you have to watch the movie.'Silver Linings Playbook' is a welcome respite from all the really awful crap in rotation now at your local movieplex!",Null,0,0,18 February 2013

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Oh Fincher...why oh why???
","David Fincher is for me one of my favourite directors around. Gems like 'Seven', 'Zodiac' and established favourites like 'Fight Club', 'The Social Network' (probably one of the most relevant movies in the past couple of years), have confirmed his movie-making capabilities! So, I was surprised when it was announced that Stieg Larsen's 'The Millennium Trilogy', comprising of 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo', 'The Girl Who Played With Fire' and 'The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest' was going to be re-made, barely two years after the Swedish adaptation of the movies had been filmed and released worldwide to great critical and financial success. I was even more surprised that Fincher had agreed to helm such 'revival'.From the beginning this whole endeavour seemed more than fishy, it reeked of desperation, something which speaks to Hollywood's current predicament to find material fit for screen. The situation must be really bad if they can't even wait a few more years before cannibalizing a trilogy of movies that was literally just released.Hollywood's risk aversion to new material, original ideas and concepts, is breathtaking in its stupidity and narrow-mindedness, and crippling to its creativity and longevity. If it wants to continue surviving, Hollywood needs to invest in a greater variety of movies, not only blockbusters with superheroes, natural disasters and alien invasions! I went to see the movie, against my better judgement, only because I really like Fincher. Was I disappointed? No not at all! What I was...I was utterly indifferent to the movie! Fincher succeeds in all the technical aspects of the movie with his usual talent and vision. Besides Rooney Mara and Christopher Plummer the rest of the cast is easily forgettable and even sub-par when compared to the actors in the Swedish movies. Now, though Rooney Mara did a good job, I do not wish to overstate her acting job. Noomy Rapace absolutely OWNS Lisbeth Salander, she IS that character...I'm sorry but Mara's portrayal couldn't hold a candle to Rapace's. Michael Nyqvist, the actor who plays the lead as Michael Bloomqvist, leaves Daniel Craig in the dust...I know this probably won't be a very popular view of this adaptation, but I'm sorry, my biggest problem with this movie was the fact that the American version wasn't really needed. It does not add anything new to the story that has already been told, there are no new angles or revelations. Except a few tweaks here and there, and Rooney's more domesticated Salander, this movie is pretty much a high-class, and pretty expensive, study in irrelevance!",Null,15,24,10 May 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," There Is Nothing Amazing About This Spiderman!!!!
","'The Amazing Spiderman' is a thoroughly unnecessary and quite pedestrian re-boot of a re-boot. Was this movie really necessary? No of course not, but in the dwindling days of Hollywood's ability to create new, original and imaginative movies, this is what passes for an 'original' idea.While re-makes are not something new, Sam Raimi's 'Spider-Man' re-boot franchise is only a few years old, and DID NOT warrant yet another franchise, as I said, a re-boot of a re-boot.People will point to the 'Batman' franchise as an example. Still, there are some differences there, after Tim Burton's first two exciting entries, Joel Schumacher managed to water down and destroy the 'Batman' franchise. Christopher Nolan took Batman and gave the Dark Knight his own spin and interpretation, making him much darker and more menacing, straddling the fine line between villain and hero. So I understood the rationale for doing that, besides Nolan delivered two excellent movies so far 'Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight'. We'll see what 'The Dark Knight Rises' will be like.Personally I never liked Spidermans as a superhero, frankly he's just not that exciting, a guy who sticks to walls and shoots thread out of his wrists...the same goes for Superman, not to keen on him either. There is no sense of danger, of conflict emanating from these characters, and most of the popular superheroes, be they Marvel or DC etc. 'Batman' is the only one that I find intriguing (from the popular ones), he himself does not have superpowers of his own, yet he has such a classic design, one that can make him look as a superhero but also a masked vigilante at the same time. With Batman you never really know where you stand...is he good or bad? For these reasons, I prefer the more complicated characters like 'Blade', 'Spawn' and 'The Punisher'. I did not like Raimi's movies, nor this one. I'd rather choose movies like 'Sin City', 'The Crow', '300', 'V-For Vendetta' and 'Watchmen' than any of the Spiderman ones.I know that I'm probably in the minority here, but I did not think that this movie was necessary in any way, shape or form, nor did I think that it was a particularly good movie to begin with! The only difference I could think of between Raimi's movies and this one, is the fact that Raimi's Spiderman's web was natural and he shot it from his wrists, while Webb's Spiderman uses cartridges to shoot his load (LOL)...other than that...pretty much nothing....just a bland and predictable movie...",Null,2,7,8 July 2012
Control," Brilliant Legacy
","***I posted this review also as a posting on a general thread.***Though I was somewhat aware of their music and of the band as a whole, Joy Division, always existed somewhere at the periphery of my consciousness.Then, a few weeks ago I walked into a record store (yeah I still enjoy buying CD's/albums) my eyes fell on 'The Best Of Joy Division', and that was that. Ever since I bought it, I cannot stop playing it. I can't describe the music, the one word that comes to mind is amazing. The sound is so mesmerizing and engaging, the instrumental arrangements, the lyrics, Ian Curtis's voice, the rhythm, beats,the talent of each band member, Stephen Morris, Peter Hook and Bernard Sumner etc. etc. etc. Joy Division is like a drug, and the more you taste the more you want to taste, thereby creating an insatiable appetite that cannot ever be satisfied!Though Joy Division was active only for a short time, (1976-1980) and their body of work is quite brief and not as voluminous as other bands that came together during those years, the influence and impact of Joy Division on music is in my opinion groundbreaking, monumental and unique. I think that even during those days their sound was so complex and ahead of its time, that most people did not know what to do with it. People were unsure of the music of Joy Division, could not peg it to a style or classify it! Even now their sound is far ahead by leaps and bounds, and the sheer complexity of the music will assign a timeless and immortal quality to it, which will in turn ensure an always vibrant continuity to their musical legacy.The influence of Joy Division is so deep and far reaching, that it is sometimes hard to quantify and qualify. It extends from Tears For Fears, Depeche Mode and The Cure (as well as virtually every band which comprised the post-punk New Wave movement) to U2, Coldplay, Keane and The Killers who also incidentally contributed their version of Joy Division's 'Shadowplay' on the movie's soundtrack and their own compilation 'Sawdust'. These are but a few of the bands and musicians that can attribute their inspiration to Joy Division. At least Bono and U2 are graceful enough to acknowledge how much they owe to Joy Division (read the group's biography 'U2' by U2).Honestly, looking at some of today's musicians and bands (I shall not name any out of respect for Joy Division), they should be ashamed to call themselves that, they should kiss the ground the walk on a give thanks to the heavens each and every day for their existence, because when compared with Joy Division they are nothing but a bunch of talentless hacks!!!! I wish Joy Division had more time to evolve, grow and reach the full potential that the band could have. Still even with the bits and pieces of their creativity out there, the brilliance of what hey achieved is unmistakable.",Null,0,0,27 April 2010

No Country for Old Men," Is Evil good?!?!?
","Bleakness, hopelessness and profound despair where the salient characteristics of this movie. It was, to say the least, a disturbing experience watching this film. It is also one of the best movies in recent years, one that once again reiterates how important the Cohen brothers are to movie-making, especially in a time when the medium is drowning in mediocrity and banality. There is a stark and barren beauty to this movie, which is brutal, shocking and jarring at times. There is absolutely no redemption in it, and hardly any sympathetic characters. The only one, who is tired and weary, and trying to preserve some shred of humanity in a world gone crazy, is Tommy Lee Jones but he fails just as one of his friends in the movie says 'You can't stop what's coming...'. Well what's coming is the walking, talking, breathing embodiment of evil in the form of Javier Bardem. To say that Bardem has created one of the most memorable 'bad guys' in movies, is an understatement. I simply have no words to describe what this man brings to the screen. Basically a guy who is what he is, accepts it and goes about his business because that's what he does, not because that is what it is expected from him. Javier Bardem's character, Anton Chigurh, is not trying to be menacing, or to be evil, remorseless, psychopathic, that's what he is, and he makes no apologies. There is no philosophy behind it, no explanation, he just is... The only other characters that come to mind in comparison are Ian McShane's amazing portrayal of 'Al Swerengen' from the extraordinary 'Deadwood' and Kevin Spacey's 'Keyser Soyze' from 'The Usual Suspects'. I'll be hard pressed to think of a better performance, acting wise, this year, with the exception of Russel Crowe and Denzel Washington in 'American Gangster'. This guy is unbelievable, ever since I saw him in 'Jamon, Jamon', 'Carne Tremula/Live Flesh', 'Las Bolas De Oro/Golden Balls', 'Before Night Falls', 'El Mar Adentro/The Sea Inside' he has proved to be one of the top actors world wide. This role is just a further confirmation of his talent and range. Come awards season if he doesn't win anything, it will just confirm that awards suck and cannot measure ability of any kind. ***SPOILERS*** Evil wins in this movie, period, and all that stand in the way die, with one exception Tommy Lee Jones, who just capitulates and gets out of the way. I think that that is what has given such a drab and dreary tone to the movie, that lack of hope and the senselessness of it all. I also think that the movie deliberately avoids too much tension and nervousness, but instead presents this chilling, matter-of-fact atmosphere that takes away that perverted pleasure to revel in the bloody and gory outcomes, unlike for example in the movie '300' where the blood and gore are amped up and actually become disturbingly fascinating, effective and well executed. 'No Country For Old Men' is the complete opposite and puts a different spin on the nature of evil and violence. ***End of SPOILERS*** The cast is very good, Woody Harelson is good and provides perhaps the few moments of comic relief, if such a thing is even possible in this movie, and Josh Brolin continues to impress with his acting abilities, he can also be seen in 'American Gangster'. Tommy Lee Jones is finally back in form and has exalted his career once again, after a few years of floundering. 'The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada', and this year 'In The Valley of Ellah' and now this movie, the man has racked up a lot of impressive performances. His role in 'No Country For Old Men' is way better than the one in 'The Fugitive', and I'll be damned if he doesn't deserve his just deserts. The Cohen brothers have once again delivered in spades, and I personally think that this movie is better than 'Fargo', and at least as good as 'Miller's Crossing'. I don't want to get into the technical details of the movie, but the cinematography is beautiful and rightly captures the spirit of the movie. I have not read the novel, but I would venture to guess that this big-screen adaptation is more than a decent one. A movie I'll not soon forget.",Null,3,9,3 December 2007

Actually, 'Bridesmaids' works an all levels and succeeds where 'The Hangover Part II' fails to. Whereas 'Bridesmaids' delivers a funny script, a great story, a fabulous cast, 'The Hangover Part II' feels forced, shallow and stilted.Kristin Wiig is great and did a fantastic job both in her role and as the writer of the movie. It soo good to see female comics and writers score a success for a change, to shut all critics up who for some insane reason think that women cannot write or direct 'raunchy' comedies!!! Ever since 'Away We Go', Maya Rudolph has been a revelation (not that she wasn't impressive before). I want to see more of her in movies, but good smart ones, like 'Bridesmaids', not some crappy run-of-the-mill romantic comedy.Then there is Rose Byrne...I have a soft spot for her and I have loved her in 'Damages', great acting, just like in 'Adam' and 'Get Him To The Greek' and now 'X-Men: First Class'. Besides being talented and smart there is a smouldering sensuality and sexuality just below the surface if you look carefully and really take her in...ahem OK this is supposed to be a review not a Danielle Steele novel!

From the Liam Neeson action catalogue, 'Taken' and 'Unknown' rank the highest, with 'The Grey', 'Non-Stop' at the bottom and 'Taken 2' in the trash bin! 'Non-Stop' joins the ranks of those movies that leave me completely and utterly indifferent to its making and existence.The movie starts out interestingly enough, but the second and third act just take on more and more preposterous aspects to the point that you just don't give a s*it! The one dimensional and clichéd characters sure don't help either!

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A laid-back fable
","I saw the movie at an early screening and I liked it. I'd even venture to say that this is the best movie Tarantino has directed since 'Kill Bill'.The best way to describe this movie would be as a laid back fable, a what if story and a bit of a word play on the title 'Once Upon A Time In Hollywood'.Throw in some alternate history and a cautionary love letter to movies, actors and all the other elements which make up Hollywood, and you got yourself an entertaining film to watch.It is also much funnier than I expected. Pitt and De Caprio are the one-two punch combo of the movie and they deliver in spades through their performances and on-screen chemistry. Margot Robbie, the movie's third focal point, has an almost ethereal presence in the movie. Not through dialogue heavy scenes, but her almost muse like appearances.This might not be Tarantino's best movie or a masterpiece, (something
many seem to expect each of his movies to be) but for me at least, it is a solid cinematic effort.8 out of 10",Null,5,7,26 July 2019

The characters, the acting and the story, the soundtrack, cinematography and all other elements collide to create one of the most powerful and memorable movies in recent years.Many will find this movie evocative and even similar to the 1978 movie 'The Driver' with Ryan O'Neal, while also recognizing some elements from 'Taxi Driver'.Make no mistake, this is Ryan Gosling's movie, an explosive performance cements this man as truly one of the top actors working today, and if his projects continue to be chosen carefully and likewise backed-up by similarly strong performances I won't shy away from calling him one of the best actors of his generation (his follow-up role in 'The Ides Of March' is no less impressive).He takes the whole image of the quiet, mysterious 'silent type' character to the next level. Long pauses in dialogue (The Kid does not say much in his movie and he does not have to), are punctuated by either quiet moments of sublime power and beauty or unexpected bloody and wonderfully disturbing explosions of emotions and actions.Albert Brooks, Ron Perlman and Brian Cranston (from TV's 'Breaking Bad') are solid here and really support Ryan Gosling's tour-de-force in this movie with their own deft and talented deliveries. Christina Hendricks (TV's 'Mad Men') and Oscar Isaac (Ridley Scott's 'Robin Hood') have smaller yet still poignant performances. Actually Christina Hendricks's scene was one of the harder to stomach...and that is saying something...mind you it does not detract from the movie but still...ouch!!!! The only weak link for me was Michelle Williams, she is not detrimental to the movie but I am not entirely sold on her as an actress or her presence in this movie. To my mind there were other actresses that could have done just as good or even a better job than her in this instant.The icing on the cake for me, is that 'Drive' really brought to my mind 'Bullit' one of my all-time favourite movies. Anybody that can conjure up that movie, and not only that, but also remind me of the unforgettable Steve McQueen with his unequalled talent and cool factor, is notable in my book. Ryan Gosling and 'Drive' more than accomplish that!PS Come awards season Ryan Gosling HAS to be recognized for his strong performances in either this movie, or 'The Ides Of March'...if not, then Hollywood is truly out-of-touch with reality and their awards and accolades are worthless and meaningless!",Null,2,5,21 November 2011
The Bourne Legacy," Bourne's legacy should have been a helluva trilogy...
","Instead of this weird and at times incomprehensible jumble of a movie! This is another thoroughly unnecessary, sequel, prequel, re-booth or whatever this film was supposed to be.It is entirely too long, and I'm usually the last to complain about a movie's length when its quality equals its running time, but not in this case. They could have easily cut 15-20 minutes from the movie and none would have been the wiser.The Bourne trilogy was very good as it was and did NOT need another movie added to it. Matt Damon re-invigorated his career playing Jason Bourne, while Doug Lyman and Paul Greengrass with Tony Gilroy as their go to screenwriter, showed what talent and creativity can produce by literally turning the spy thriller genre on its head! Proof is in the pudding as they say and the two subsequent James Bond movies reflected that new reality. Craig's 007, is, like Damon's Bourne, a much more somber, violent and unpredictable man, with a penchant for close-quarters-combat and revenge.'The Bourne Legacy' was an unfocused, at times meandering and messy film. Which is kind of surprising, given that Tony Gilroy's directorial debut was the superb 'Michael Clayton', I don't know, but I expected more..I mean what was the deal with that whole episode with the wolf, I mean I know and understood what happened in it and its purpose. Still, I gotta ask, really?! The cast was alright and while I like Jeremy Renner as an actor, 'The Hurt Locker, 'The Town' and now 'The Avengers', he really did not shine like his usual self in this movie. It looked like he tried to step into Damon's shoes and continue his ( no pun intended) legacy, however that did not work at all...Rachek Weisz was OK but the rest of the cast was just there...I hope that they really stop making anymore Bourne movies, with no Bourne in them.However, given Hollywood's on-going identity crisis and lack of originality and creativity, I doubt that we've seen the last of 'Bourne's universe', which in this movie fan's humble opinion would be a mistake!",Null,2,7,12 August 2012
1917," A message...
","Unfortunately I did not get to see this movie in theatres, as it was meant to be seen. But I made due with the Blu-ray version. Even so this movie did not disappoint.A cinematic achievement of sorts this is indeed. Perfect no. But it need not be. What it is...it is moving, harrowing, addictive, haunting and mesmerizing all wrapped in a savage beauty courtesy of the great and wonderful Roger Deakins whose subtle brilliance is all over this movie, guided by Sam Mendes's direction.The story is compelling and lean so as to fit the movie's framework. The cast (thank you once again Nina Gold!) is on point, the music/score is epic when needed and eerriely beautiful, courtesy of Thomas Newman. In short this movie is all one expects and wants in a film worth more than its title, subject matter or surrounding hype. As I've said, it is not a perfect movie by any means, and surely lends itself open to some valid criticisms.Still, '1917' will definitely take it's place amongst the best war movies. Is it the best ever. No. But it sure deserves to be considered amongst them. We all think about 'Platoon', 'Full Metal Jacket', 'Saving Private Ryan', 'The Thin Red Line', 'Flags Of Our Fathers/Letters From Iwo Jima' and miniseries such as 'Band Of Brothers' and 'The Pacific', just to name a few of the movies and shows worthy of praise and accolades. '1917', even flawed, I think does belong amongst them and in my opinion, it more than gives Christopher Nolan and his magnum opus 'Dunkirk' a run for it's money.While there are other compelling WWI movies, a war that has failed to ignite the same response and interest as WWII, especially in Hollywood, '1917' is a fine addition.8 out of 10",Null,1,2,14 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Luke Milks A Sea Cow, Super Leia Is Marry Poppins And Snoke Is Only Half A Man
","When in 2015 I had the displeasure of watching the bland and unremarkable copy-and-paste Star Wars-like 'The Force Awakens', from noted hack and serial plagiarist J J Abrams, I had a hard time imagining how the next instalment in this new, soulless trilogy could be worse.But Rian Johnson surely took care of that....by delivering something, much, much worse in the fecal cinematic form of ' The Last Jedi'. One of the worst movies of 2017 and the worst 'Star Wars' movie period. 'The Last Jedi' is soo bad that it singlehandedly rehabilitates and redeems the Prequel Trilogy!!!!It is an overly long, sinfully boring, painfully stupid cinematic vomitfest. The humour and attempts at levity are badly timed and cringeworthy. A malnourished story is wrapped in meaningless and idiotic plots and subplots.The direction is shoddy, the screenplay, if you can call it that, is subpar at best, the score is terribly forgettable and the special effects are average popcorn blockbuster fare.The cast is either completely wasted, like Andy Serkis, Laura Dern, Benicio Del Toro, Oscar Isaac, Gwendoline Christie, Mark Hamil and worst of all Carrie Fisher...or outright underwhelming and terrible. Of special note in the terrible department is John Boyega, Kelly Marie Tran and Daisy Ridley.With this latest instalment, my interest in the New Trilogy has pretty much evaporated. I really couldn't care less about Episode IX.'The Last Jedi' is literally the cinematic turd in the punch bowl.RIP Carrie Fisher1 out of 10",Null,0,1,21 December 2017
Brave," The Pirates Of Pixar...leashed by Disney!
","'Brave' is another Pixar creature unleashed upon the world...It still contains the Pixar magic of creativity and originality, in so far as the story and characters, the animation quality and the production values.However recently, under Disney's tutelage, Pixar's vitality has started to fade away and die a slow painful death. While 'Brave' still maintains some of the legendary Pixar vitality, it is also an example of how Pixar has started to become worn around the edges...The movie still makes for a fun family viewing, with plenty for the adults sprinkled in there to keep the level of laughs quite high. Yet something is missing from this movie, which feels a lot more formulaic and restrained, something Pixar movies were never known for. 'UP' was indeed Pixar's last minor masterpiece.It will be interesting what the future holds for the studio and its increasingly troubled relationship with Disney.I would recommend 'Brave' as a movie, but with the caveat that hopefully Pixar's future projects re-gain their once almost expected quality. If 'Brave' is a sign of things to come, then I'm not hopeful for the future of Pixar or animation for that matter...",Null,3,6,25 June 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," Turdmasters Of The Universe!
","First let me say that this review is not meant to dissuade anyone from enjoying this movie or going to see it...after all we each have our own tastes and preferences which apply to a myriad of things in life. Yet I am not one of those that liked or enjoyed 'Guardians Of The Galaxy'...I know...shocking!!! I had misgivings about this movie since the beginning, but after all the hype it has been getting recently, and at a friend's insistence, and against my better judgement, I went to see it...and boy do I regret it! It was underwhelming to say the least!'Guardians Of The Galaxy' is yet another big, blockbuster, popcorn behemoth in the increasing tradition of movies that like to keep pretending that they stand for something or possess a deeper meaning than the actually do! Do not be fooled into believing, guided by the cries of joy and applause it is getting, that this is some kind of irreverent, anti-establishment, rebellious, subversive movie, a proverbial cinematic middle-finger to the franchise, re-boot, sequelitis infirm and moribund Hollywood! This isn't the wink, wink, nudge, nudge (thank you Monty Python for that one!) kind of film! As many of its $100 or $200 million dollars plus budget counterparts, this is yet another blighted vomit fest of explosions, special effects...a thunderous, meaningless, meandering cacophony of irrelevant sights and sounds, all neatly disguised under a thin, and I mean very thin, coating of substance! It is populated by characters I didn't care for, a story that left me somewhere from indifferent to bored, accompanied by direction and production values that fit into the cookie-cutter mold of the Marvel- Disney juggernaut! The only reason I did not give it a lower rating than 4 out of 10 was that sometimes(though not often enough)some of the humour and jokes hit their target, and I thought that Groot was mildly interesting.It will surely make money and win accolades, blah, blah, blah...but for me as a moviegoer, this flick, 'Guardians Of The Galaxy' or as I re-named them 'Turdmasters Of The Universe', will fade from memory and join the ranks of a sadly increasing list of movies I won't care to remember I have ever seen.",Null,24,54,6 August 2014
The Hangover Part II," What the f **k is going on?!?!? as Stu would say...
","In life the rule is, if at first you don't succeed, then try, try again. In Hollywood the rule is, if something works once replicate it again and again until the life is sucked out of it! By this I mean movies, in this case 'The Hangover' which was one the best comedies I had seen in a long time.I believed then, like 2 years ago when the original came out, that this movie should NOT have a sequel, a belief I still cling to...though I guess I might be in the minority on that one. Does Hollywood listen to movie fans who these days crave for some original concepts, ideas, anything besides sequels and re-boots? The short answer: of course not! The long answer...well I don't have time for it.I could spend time discussing what worked in the first movie that does not work in this one, but what would be the point?! I only want to say that the joy-de-vivre, the excitement and the craziness of the original are lacking here by enlarge. 'The Hangover Part II' has its moments definitely, but too many times it feels hollow and forced...That is the best I could come up with for an explanation as to why I was not particularly taken with it...it is not completely awful but by then end I was...meh! If you want to see a better, funnier comedy, my advice would be to go and see 'Bridesmaids', a movie that hits all the notes that 'The Hangover Part II' does not! 'Bridesmaids' works on all cylinders, that is until the powers that be decide to make another ten sequels!",Null,1,2,7 June 2011
Logan," Logan's...True Grit?! Nope...just another 'meh' movie...
","Despite all the expectations I had about this movie, I wasn't necessarily looking for a masterpiece. Just a proper send-off to a favourite character of mine and an actor who brought him to life with dedication, passion and appreciation for his fans.Unfortunately, it turns out 'Logan' was not the send-off I wanted for Wolverine and Hugh Jackman. Instead what I found was an overly long, pedestrian and even mediocre movie, which surely had its fair share of high-points, but not enough to make this movie one I loved or even liked.'Logan', while not a horrible movie, is missing something, that spark, that vitality, which should have lifted this movie above the fray. But that was not the case. Too bad, this movie should and could have been more.",Null,6,13,11 March 2017
Puss in Boots," They also call me Chupacabra!
","'Puss-in-Boots' is one of the funniest and most entertaining animated movies I have seen in recent times. Its not perfect by any means, as some parts seem to drag and at times the movie felt a bit too long for its own good, but on the whole it made for a nice viewing.I remember a decade or more ago when CGI movies were an event to behold. Each release was noteworthy. Movies like the original 'Toy Story', 'Finding Nemo', 'Ice Age', 'Monsters Inc.' and the first 'Shrek'. To that veritable gallery I would venture to add the spectacularly underrated 'Final Fantasy'. When I saw that movie back in 1999 (damn, I can't believe that was soo long ago...holly crap I'm getting old!), the potential of CGI movies was fully revealed. I thoroughly enjoyed the visionary creativity of that film, especially since it had a more mature, adult slant (something sorely lacking in CGI movies, especially in North America, where CGI movies seem to be exclusively aimed at a young audience).Since then technology has advanced by leaps and bounds and so have CGI movies. Now it seems that there is one of them coming out every other week. This has not necessarily translated into an all-around positive effect, because while their quantity has increased, their quality has steadily declined. Adding 3D effects and cutesy side-kicks cannot make up for the lack of having a compelling story, an interesting plot and well developed characters.This brings me back to 'Puss-In-Boots'. This movie has all that, a compelling story, a good message, funny characters and a lot of humour, including a healthy dose of those 'in-jokes' intended for the adults in the audience, in most cases the parents who tag along with their kids to watch the movie. That makes it a truly good family viewing because not only will the children have a good time, but there is plenty for the adults to enjoy too.'Puss-In-Boots' is the most entertaining CGI (animated) movie I've seen since 'Despicable Me' and 'Monsters Vs. Aliens'. Not on par with the gem that was 'UP', but a solid offering of funny!'We found a bag of catnip on you!' jail guard. 'Its for my glaucoma!', Puss. Enough said...",Null,20,25,13 November 2011
Super 8," Am I Spielberg's Bitch?...Thought JJ Abrams
","They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, to that I would add, that it is also the clearest expression of mediocrity...which is what 'Super 8' is.This is another one of the numerous movies I have had to file under the fastly increasing category of 'I expected more'! I'm getting tired of it...a movie that had some interesting ideas and concepts, but was done for by obsessingly trying to pay homage to Spielberg's early popcorn juggernauts 'ET' and 'Close Encounters Of The Third Kind'. The cast was unremarkable, and I'm trying to be gentle, that goes for both the kids and the adults. No matter how much they tried to mimic the late 70's-early 80's, the kids especially, could not wipe away the Twitter and Facebook stains from their faces and their characters...the wooden, empty and shallow essence, which this upcoming generation has so successfully adopted as its mantra. That wooden, lethargic zombie-like mentality and way of existing comes through every frame, to the movie's detriment. And these were just the child actors, don't get me started on the adults.There is NOTHING remarkable about this movie, not the special effects, not the production values, not the soundtrack, not the cinematography etc.This is a perfect specimen of mediocrity...if you haven't yet noticed mediocrity is the quality which best describes the times we live in these days!",Null,6,11,16 June 2011
Jack Reacher," Jack Who?
","If 'Jack Reacher' was supposed to start a new movie franchise, well this effort was the wrong way to start it! I think that in a world defined by James Bond on one hand and Jason Bourne on the other, 'Jack Reacher' was meant to fall somewhere in-between. Unfortunately that was a mistake and part of the reason that the movie failed to catch on at the box office.Instead of trying to perhaps fill-in or bridge the gap between Bond and Bourne, Reacher should have inhabited its own space and stood apart from all the other franchises! The movie veered from the serious to the silly quite often, with some scenes sprinkled within that defied explanation through their stupidity and cringe inducing awkwardness.I have not read any of the Reacher novels, but am aware enough of the physical description and attributes of the lead character, to realize, as have apparently many others, that the role was miscast, perhaps fatally so, in so far as this movie goes. The height, weight and physicality of the character not only serve the character in a visual, descriptive manner, but is also part and parcel of who the character is! So when Tom Cruise got his hands on the role, fans of the novels were enraged and newcomers to Reacher's universe were miffed to say the least. Apparently the only one who has not fazed by all this was the author himself, which leads me to surmise that he was therefore submitted to some kind of Scientology ritual...to 'cleanse' away any doubts or opposition, that and a healthy amount of money! If my understanding is correct, Jack Reacher is a world-weary guy, exhausted by his past and very uncomfortable with his present. The man is supposed to be a hermit, not that you would know it by watching Cruise...fumble his way across the screen!The storyline is interesting enough, but in the hands of this director and this actor it assumes with ease the mantel of mediocrity and boredom. Rosamund Pyke is the only one who is given anything remotely resembling an interesting role. The other one, strangely enough, I found any empathy towards, was Alexia Fast who played Sandy, the young woman used to lure Reacher into a trap. Besides that I did not give a rat's a** about anyone else, including Reacher.I will go all out and say that this movie fails on many levels, acting and directing being the main ones, but the overall bad vibe I got from this movie comes directly from Tom Cruise himself. He should have never been cast in this movie! Jack Reacher is an interesting character and there are sure enough worthy movies in that budding literary franchise to be churned out, is just that Tom Cruise should not be a part of it!If any other studio decides to take another chance on Jack Reacher, and I hope they do, a better decision making and planning process as to screen writing, casting and directing should be in place to ensure that next time, if there is one, the movie has a better chance at succeeding!",Null,18,32,27 January 2013
The Witch," From the Blair Witch to The Witch...a hipster crapfest!
","Yep folks exactly that! I had heard a great deal about this new, little flick that could. Apparently there was a good vibe about this movie as well as positive response and feedback...the darling movie at Sundance...So naturally, I went in to see it with some interest and some hopeful, albeit modest, expectations. After all this time of the year treats it's movie going audiences to a plethora of toxic cinematic garbage. Case in point 'Deadpool', nothing more than a pedestrian cinematic mediocrity, sits at the top of the crap pile. So in order to avoid Ryan Reynolds at all costs and his painful mimicking impression at being edgy and original, I went for 'The Witch' as somekind of anti-dote...And instead of anything remotely original, visionary or at least entertaining, I was treated to a overwrought, self-important, self-congratulatory, lazy and underwhelming turd of a movie! Interesting cast, gorgeous cinematography...the rest...forgettable, disposable and utterly inconsequential. You know, it is very easy to pick on big budget or genre movies and to bring them down and pounce on them. But indie movies have somehow gotten a pass over the years, because of this fake aura of authenticity they seem to carry whenever they come out of a film festival, like Sundance for example. Not this time. Nope, not at all. 'The Witch' plain sucks...badly...and unfortunately in the process reminds me of 'The Blair Witch Project' another fetid piece of putrefaction, which gives me vivid migraines to this very day!",Null,6,13,23 February 2016
It Chapter Two," Uneven Chapters
","Well after waiting for two years... finally saw the movie. Definitely not as good as the first one. 'IT Chapter II' is quite uneven and longer than it should be. Too much filler at times, spaces that could have been better used for character building. Also the humour doesn't always hit it's mark and the ahem...cameo of a certain auteur...was really unecessary...and self-serving.The movie doesn't establish the adult characters and their lives and how they got to where they are. The cast is uneven as well and so are the performances. The children were much more enjoyable and entertaining to watch than their adult counterparts.And now it's clear, even more so, Amy Adams should have been cast as the grownup version of Beverly Marsh (she and Sophia Lilis has already worked together on 'Sharp Objects' on HBO).But there is still enough to like, if not enjoy, in this movie not to make it a complete failure or outright flop.5 out of 10",Null,1,4,6 September 2019
The Reader," Apology not accepted...
","In the interest of full disclosure, I first posted this as a comment on a thread dealing with 'The Reader' and any potential lessons that may or may not have come out of the movie: That is the whole point I took from the movie. There are some things that cannot be washed away, guilt for which there is no repentance. Kate Winslett's character, Hana Schmitz is racked with guilt and her attempt at dealing with that guilt is taking on the blame for having written the report which justified the death of 300 Jewish women, even though she was illiterate.But she clearly realizes that any act of contrition, any apology, any sorrow, though genuine, could not under any circumstance make up for what she did. If a human being is the total sum of the decisions and choices made throughout a lifetime, then this is as good example as any, that indeed we are what we say and do. As it was clear, Hana had gotten a promotion in Siemens AG as the war was starting, but due to her illiteracy she could not accept the promotion that would have seen her required to do office work. It was the same when her supervisor offers her a promotion when she was working as a ticket vendor/controller on the streetcar.Yet there were people in the same situation as her, people that chose another path in life, instead she made the choice to become an SS camp guard, nobody forced her, and the reason that 'it was a job' was a poor excuse as the movie makes it plainly clear. Yet, when she asked the judge 'What would you have done?', the man was clearly stumped, because he did not have any answers.Also, this points to the larger issue of national guilt. No matter what Germany does, it will always have to confront this terrible legacy which is now part of its history and its very fabric and psyche (as do many other countries in Europe e.g. Russia, Italy, France, all of Eastern Europe and so on). As one of Michael's classmates points out, the trial was a sham, it was a way to deflect guilt from the many to the few, it was a way for Germany to exorcise the demon of the Holocaust from its very soul, a futile attempt alas. As that same character remarked, it is much easier to point the finger at a certain group of people and say 'they are evil, they are guilty, they should pay', instead of accepting your own share of guilt and complicity in such a harrowing and terrible event in our history. That character enunciates the whole issue, that it was not just the Nazis that had participated and brought to fruition the Holocaust, but that also all German people bore some responsibility for it, through direct action, complicit silence or utter ignorance.I think that instead trying to rationalize something like this and pass the blame to people as obvious and grotesque as the Nazis, it is better to own it and embrace it in all its ugliness and terror. The Nazis have become over time gruesome caricatures of evil, a matrix for what evil is. I think that the more frightening aspect of the Holocaust and other such sad and tragic episodes in history is that the perpetrators are more often than not, all too human and not the monsters we would like them to be. That is far more disturbing.One cannot absolve himself of such a deed, an individual or a nation, as the Holocaust, but one can have the resolve to accept the all encompassing guilt emanating from it and teach others about the perils of history, be always vigilant and serve as a living example of what man is capable in face of boundless ambition, thirst for power and the utter need to demonstrate purity and superiority above others.I think that 'The Reader' imparts this lesson if one is only willing to pay attention and have an open mind. Lena Olin's character of the Holocaust survivor tells Ralph Finnes's character 'Absolution is something I do not want nor have the right to give' (I'm paraphrasing here). Kate Winslett's character does not apologize because no apology could ever make up for her deeds. But both both victim and victimizer in the end come as close to an agreement as possible, to a commonality, Hana Schmitz leaves Michael her money, and Lena Olin's character agrees in the end with Michael's suggestion that the money be given to a charity dealing with literacy. In that, there is a common purpose and as close to an understanding as possible, and it comes full circle to the issue of learning.As Bruno Ganz's character, the professor, tells Michael, 'If people like you don't learn from what happened to people like me, then what the hell is the point of it all?'. We have to learn from history lest we be doomed to repeat it, and in learning we have to step out of our own comfort zone and learn from both the victims but as well as the perpetrators, as difficult as that may be.So it is perhaps right, that nothing good came out of the story, because nothing good is supposed to, how can it?",Null,2,4,24 February 2009
The Wrestler," Have you ever seen a broken man...
","If the phrase 'the little movie that could' applies to any movie this year then it most certainly does to 'The Wrestler'. It is one of the best movies I've seen last year, and more than that it is even more special due to the brilliant and amazing performance of its cast.The return of Mickey Rourke was overdue, a gifted and talented actor, who in my opinion was wrongly shunned and marginalized because of his past attitude and behaviour which marked him as a 'bad boy'. Hollywood surely likes to sometimes punish its own, especially those individuals who don't repent and crawl on their knees asking for 'cinematic forgiveness' from their peers. What happened to Mickey Rourke was pure hypocrisy on the part of an industry that has no problem tolerating much, much worse behaviour on the part of less talented individuals; an industry that from time to time seeks to attain some kind of superficial saving grace marked by a phony mea culpa and a symbolic sacrificial lamb, in this case Mickey Rourke. I ask, how is what he did any different than the behaviour of let's say Lindsay Lohan, whom many critics where at one point anointing her as the next Jody Foster or Merryl Streep?!?!? Talk about self-imposed blindness! When I last saw Rourke in 'Sin City', I was, albeit briefly but forcefully reminded, of how good of an actor he really is. So imagine my pleasure and anticipation when 'The Wrestler' came out! At heart this is a story of redemption, but here comes the kick, it is actually an attempt and ultimate failure at redemption, at least in the sense that redemption is understood in today's society. This is a profoundly sad movie, but that fact does not take away one bit from the movie, rather it makes it more believable and even more powerful.As Bruce Springsteen's song by the same title points out, there are some wrongs that can't be righted and some wounds that can't be mended, and that is the situation Mikey Rourke's character finds himself in. I don't want to discuss the movie in detail, nor give anything away from the plot or storyline, suffice to say that this is one viewing that is more than worth sitting through from beginning to end.Rourke, Marisa Tomei (another grossly underrated actress) and Evan Rachel Wood are phenomenal and really hold their own and make the most of their on-screen time. Whatever award nominations and wins these actors are likely to get are more than deserved. Darren Aronofsky has really grown by leaps and bounds in his solid and varied career as director. I am personally glad that he decided to helm this project, the end result speaks for itself.Ultimately there is redemption to be found in this movie, but it comes at a heavy price, to me that redemption takes the form of the triumph of the human spirit against insurmountable odds and seemingly impossible choices. These days that is a bold statement to make!",Null,8,9,21 January 2009
The Big Short," Keeping Up With The Kardashians...wait what?!
","'The Big Short' is what happens when you keep up with the Kardashians instead of the world around you.'The Big Short' is what happens when you allow greed and stupidity to co-exist and then you go on to praise the fruits of their loom (no not the t-shirt and underwear company)...'The Big Short' happened because we allowed it to happen. Lost amidst all of the finger pointing, posturing and outrage...we conveniently forgot our own complicity as a people in this whole mess. Our own greed, selfishness and desire for the easy life, the easy way out, paved the path and greased the wheels for all these Wall Street types to do what they did. We, without wanting to know about it, gave them our blessing. And they went ahead and they did what they know to do...make money at all costs. Sure, financiers (of all types) and regulators, governments etc., etc, etc., deserve a large share of the blame. No doubt. But the proof is in the pudding, the devil is in the details. With the exception of a few suckers, more like sacrificial lambs, not one of the people responsible for this has ever been punished or went to jail. Worse, we went on to bail them out of the mess they created and on top of that were left to foot the bill and pay the real life cost of the outcome of that mess. And the cherry on top of this s*it cake? Now, almost 8 years later, after what was dubbed the Great Recession, pretty much the same individuals are back doing what they did then, but on an even larger scale and we are in an even worse position to head off or prevent another crisis like the one in 2008. Or probably much worse and much bigger. 'The Big Short' happens because we shirk our own responsibility. Oh yeah and the movie is really good too...you should check it out...",Null,1,2,8 January 2016
Prometheus," Not the beginning, but a beginning!
","Let me make this clear from the outset, 'Prometheus' is not a direct prequel to 'Alien' or the subsequent movies in that franchise. Ridley Scott's established creatures do have a role to play but it is more marginal, more on the fringes of this movie.This is another visually arresting and well told tale from the mind and vision of legendary director Ridley Scott. This is NOT as I said a prequel per se, but rather an origins story of sort. It deals with larger questions than just the aliens themselves, questions of life, who we are, where do we come from, what is the point of our existence, are we alone in the Universe etc.Though these are heady and quite fundamental questions, the movie does, in its own way, answer them to some degree. Even the fact that a movie even attempts to grapple with these existential questions these days, is a plus.In what has been a rather underwhelming year for movies, so far, 'Promotheus' stands alone, at least in my eyes, as one movie that I can call good, well done, with both style and substance.Good cast, good direction, eye-popping visuals, good special effects amount to a solid sci-fi movie, or a good movie in general.I am not going to stand here and brand 'Prometheus' a masterpiece, or a perfect movie, because it isn't. But in the day and age of expecting movies to constantly disappoint and underwhelm with their mediocrity and lack of quality and vision, 'Promotheus' at least has that, which is more than I can say for most other movies I've seen so far!",Null,2,6,15 June 2012

","Looking at the reviews and ratings for 'Wonder Woman', gives me the sense that critics and audiences got caught in the hype and hubris of what this means and symbolizes versus what the movie actually is.Because actually watching 'Wonder Woman', what I was left with, war a rather mediocre, subpar and overly long movie, which did not escape the underwhelming cookie-cutter mould oftentimes movies of the superhero genre are subject and prisoners to. There was nothing above average about this film and worst of all and even unforgivable it was fairly boring and dour for a significant amount of time.So where to start with this movie. I could write a whole essay about its flaws and shortcomings. But I won't. Suffices to say that problems abound in editing, pacing, cinematography, special effects, script, casting and so forth. Just to pick on a few examples, throughout the movie there were instances when the CGI was just bad, cheesy and looking completely undercooked and unfinished! Which is something you might forgive a TV series due to obvious budgetary limitations, but not a movie with a $150 million dollars budget! What did they spent the money on...catering? Actually I've seen modestly budgeted TV shows have better CGI than 'Wonder Woman' had at times. And what is with the frequent and repeated use of the slo-mo effects?!?! That special effect was innovative in 1999 when the 'The Matrix' came out, by now as a tool of the trade it is played out and tiresome. The slo-mo effects have become Zach Snyder's calling card much like lens flares have become JJ Abram's. It doesn't mean other directors should emulate and copy them. Looking at you Patty Jenkins.The cast I found rather bland and underwhelming. Edit: Actually I liked Robin Wright and Connie Nielsen in their roles, they looked and sounded the part, but had soo little screen time that they didn't have the opportunity to make a positive and lasting impact on the movie's overall quality.Which brings me to Gal Gadot. She might look like a version of Wonder Woman, somewhat, but so do many fans in cosplay. I think casting Gal Gadot was more a matter of looks and style versus actual substance and abilities. I found her acting range to be quite limited and her on-screen presence rather stiff. I thought and still do that there are other more accomplished and versatile actresses who could have served the role and character of Wonder Woman better.It looks like since Nolan's Batman trilogy, DC movie projects have taken an IQ dive...not that Marvel is any better...and that is in large part because Zach Snyder and co., have laid the foundation of what the DCEU looks, feels like and is. And now all subsequent additions to this cinematic and even TV universe are beholden and slaves to that vision. Personally I would have loved to see what an unshackled Michelle McLaren could have accomplished with a movie like this.And that is part of the overall problem. As movie audiences and critics, we've come to accept mediocrity in our entertainment (much like in many other aspects of our society), and we have been left with these increasingly higher scale, higher budget movies which deliver less and less. Whenever one even rises a bit above that line of mediocrity, we deem it a resounding success and reward it accordingly. That is the law of diminishing returns.",Null,88,166,7 June 2017
Taken 2," They'll be coming for you again...and again...and again...
","It has become painfully clear that the powers that be, i.e. the money behind movies, have gained entirely too much control over the creative process, otherwise how can we explain the constant stream of prequels and sequels which have of late occupied the big screen over the past few years? I get tired of repeating this constant theme...I truly sound like a broken record with this!A few years ago when I saw the original 'Taken', I left the theatre thoroughly satisfied by the experience I had watching Liam Neeson kick ass and take no prisoners, in what was a cool, hip and to my mind, old fashioned thriller which reminded me of movies like 'Bullit', the Dirty Harry movies, and the 'Death Wish' franchise. Besides, it didn't have CGI effects or any other distracting bells and whistles! It made a strong case for revenge, and though it is not in my nature to enjoy revenge or encourage it as a course of action, I found myself cheering alongside my fellow audience members as we watched Neeson dispatch the baddies with such ruthless efficiency. After all how could I not, watching a father exact vengeance upon those who hurt his daughter! Seeing him dismantle a ring of human smugglers, was pure awesomeness!!! The movie ended on a perfect note! The necessity of a sequel was at least to my mind mercifully excluded.Cue a few years later and an itch to squeeze a few more bucks out of a movie which should have been left alone...and voilà we have 'Taken 2', another thoroughly unnecessary sequel. Thankfully just as other reviewers have already pointed out, the movie is not nearly as bad as it could have been. Neeson remains in form and is still good to see him in action, that is probably because this movie rests on his shoulders. In fact he is the only reason this movie remains even tolerable. Otherwise, 'Taken 2', is in every way a step down from the first movie. The action is sluggish, the plot is convoluted and oftentimes the entire premise of the movie is preposterous! The script in this case seems to have been an afterthought...kind of tacked on later...it is virtually the same storyline from the first movie (this has to be the unluckiest family ever!), just add the wife, revenge-seeking relatives of the baddies from the first instalment, substitute Paris for Istanbul, and you got yourself a movie! The cast is weak and pretty much window-dressing since they are not given much to do. The storyline is ridiculous and at times it borders on being plain stupid! The acting here is non-existent, while Famke Jansen and Maggie Grace are completely wasted here, except being relegated to filling up the required spaces of a fragile accessory and an annoying side-kick.As I said before, 'Taken 2' is not as bad as I thought it would be, but I cannot recommend it as a must-see or anything of the kind. Don't waste your money on this one...PS As a side note, this movie does not paint a very positive portrait of Albanians...also, apparently all bad guys nowadays come from the same place...Trebuje!",Null,0,0,6 November 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Force Awakens...A New Hope?!
","'Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery but also the clearest expression of mediocrity'. Yep someone said that somewhere...can't remember who or where, but they do deserve credit, because in a way it perfectly encompasses the case of Jar Jar Abrams and 'Star Wars Episode VII The Force Awakens' and his overlords at Darth Disney.Jar Jar Abrams did what was exactly expected of him. Restart the 'Star Wars' franchise, now under the Disney banner, and justify their $4 billion dollar purchase of Lucasfilm, without stumbling out of the starting gate. That he achieved.Let me also say, that I never hated the Prequel Trilogy, and rather enjoyed the movies, imperfect though they were, except Jar Jar Binks (not to be confused with Jar Jar Abrams!)...that guy should be murdered and then cooked into a delicious meal of frog legs or whatever...but I will not be comparing those movies with this one!Personally, and this makes it clear how subjective all these reviews are, I found 'The Force Awakens' to be on OK, decent, alright flick. I was not overwhelmed by it. It is not a masterpiece, but neither was I underwhelmed, I do not hate the movie, despise it or anything of the sort.Abrams has been an astute and observant student of the George Lucas and Steven Spielberg school of movie-making. Many of his projects, especially the cinematic ones, have been almost love letters to them. And such is the case with 'The Force Awakens'. It is a tribute from Abrams, as a fan, to the people and times which influenced and pushed him to become a movie maker.Abrams is a technically adept director, but in his imitation-is-flattery type of movie-making also lies his mediocrity as I was alluding to in the opening line. That lack of a cinematic identity has unfortunately and oftentimes marked him as a director for hire, as in this instance here, with Disney and Abram's involvement with 'Star Wars' (and other projects as well).And therein lies perhaps the greatest weakness in 'The Force Awakens', this smattering of mediocrity, it is a movie steeped in nostalgia, at some points so much so, that it feels like less of a new beginning and more like a re-boot or remake of 'A New Hope'...or even worse, a carbon copy.It is very clear that Darth Disney wasn't going to screw around with its newest acquisition slash golden goose, Lucasfilm. As I said, this is a safe movie at the hands of a safe director, who can create carbon copies and perfect replicas of Lucas and Spielberg's movies, but who lacks a vision and style of his own.One of the things I like most about the movie, were the new casting additions to the franchise. Oscar Isaac, one of my favourite actors, goes without saying, but also John Boyega and Daisy Ridley. To me she is the heart and soul of the movie. It will be interesting to see how her story arc will develop. Plus Daisy Ridley is just lovely. They inject much needed life in this franchise.Lets see what Rian Johnson and Colin Trevorrow will do. I think and hope, Rian Johnson will do a good job. Less certain about Colin Trevorrow, though I enjoyed 'Safety Not Guaranteed' (I really wish we could get Doug Lyman to direct Episode IX'Edge Of Tomorrow' was outstanding).Next up, is 'Star Wars Rogue One', and though I am not enthused about Gareth Edwards directing, I actually find myself more intrigued about 'Rogue One' than 'The Force Awakens'4 out of 10",Null,3,11,25 December 2015
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," 10 Out Of 10 - A Decade Of Harry Potter
","It seems these days, that we have come to we live in a world of cynicism and low expectations, punctuated by mediocrity and ignorance, a world whose only highlights are a mindless pursuit of fame and notoriety. In this seemingly bottomless void, stepped JK Rowling and Harry Potter, with and old-fashioned tale of loyalty, friendship, courage, self-sacrifice, love, care and the understanding that sometimes there are undertakings and noble pursuits greater than ourselves, actions worthy of a common goal, whose end result will benefit a cause worthier than our immediate selfish wants, namely the greater good (which is a recurring theme in the books and the movies). No matter what one might think about the whole Harry Potter phenomenon, one cannot deny the impressive and positive impact upon the world.I did not start out as a Harry Potter fan, my own life being too busy and hectic to allow me paying attention to what I saw as a fanciful children's tale. For the turnaround I credit, as strange as it might seem, Alfonso Cuaron. I was a fan of his previous movies, and I was drawn and curious by the fact that he should choose to work on the Harry Potter franchise. After I saw 'The Prisoner of Azkaban' everything changed. I was lucky enough to discover the world of Harry Potter through this master movie-maker's lens, and what a wonderful introduction it was! Subsequently I watched all the movies and became more and more impressed.You have to understand that I saw the movies first long before reading any of the novels. In time however, after all the books had been published I went back and saw each movie and read the corresponding novel. In hindsight I think, I was lucky to do it that way, since I had no pre-conceived notions or expectations.Now that I have seen the last movie and read the last novel, I can see it all stretch before my mind's eye, the wonderful complexity, the imagination, originality and great sense of wonder these works, both books and movies, contain and impart on all its fans, both readers and viewers.No, the movies are not perfect, far from it, they are at times quite uneven in vision, style, understanding of the material, but overall I think that they retained the essence and spirit of the books, and gave a wonderful visual rendition of Rowling's work. My favourites remain to this day 'The Prisoner of Azkaban' and 'The Goblet Of Fire'.Alas, my thanks and appreciation go to JK Rowling whose brilliant mind gave us this gift, and to Chris Columbus, Alfonso Cuaron, Mike Newell, David Yates, as well as Steven Klovis and David Heyman, the group of people who worked tirelessly in bringing to life, on the big screen, the universe of Harry Potter and his friends. I would be remiss not to also say a big thank you to Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint as well as the rest of the cast and crew of these movies who literally inhabited these characters and their world, and created such a believable and authentic version of them before our very eyes. Whatever they may choose to do with their lives, and whatever their lives might become, I wish all these people nothing but the best and good luck always. A nod also to Warner Bros. for their support and commitment to this whole project.It was a wonderful adventure and I'm privileged to have been part of it in my small way!

John Wick: Chapter 2," An Unwanted Crapfest...
","I am sorry to say but 'John Wick Chapter 2' was a complete pile of dung. A mind-numbingly stupid, idiotic movie, an unwanted, not asked for sequel, made purely as a cash-grab...Whereas the first instalment was an excellently paced, choreographed and directed movie, inhabited by a great kinetic energy, with not an ounce of unwanted cinematic fat, this lazy, special needs cousin is the definition of sequelitis.Much like those sub-par sequels took all the fun and shine out of 'Taken'...same case here.I really wanted to be entertained, if nothing else, but this turd couldn't deliver even that much. Ugh...",Null,6,12,11 March 2017
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Join The Circus If You Want To Live!
","That is pretty much the motto of this 3rd instalment in the 'Madagascar' franchise...a real place which most people probably couldn't point out on the map...you know that island next to that continent we call Africa...no no no, not Antartica...I said Africa, stop looking at the South Pole...Since the past couple of years have been dominated by sequels, prequels and re-boots (and re-boots of re-boots...'The Amazing Spiderman'...really do we need another one?!), 'Madagascar 3..' and whatever the rest of the title was, sure falls into those categories very neatly.The movie has its funny moments, and is sure to be enjoyed by the kiddies, the adults will also be entertained a few moments at the time, before nodding-off or checking their BlackBerries or Iphones.As a sequel it is not bad, it introduces a few new characters, some worthwhile, others just filler. I guess by this point, as they did with the 'Shrek' franchise, Dreamworks decided this will be the movie where everyone will find a significant other and fall in love. It almost without a doubt sets up the obligatory fourth instalment where all our animal heroes will have children...just ask Shrek...no wonder he looked soo depressed and suicidal the last movie he was in...Since this sequel takes place in Europe, they chose the right spot, Monaco...to be more specific Monte Carlo, the one place where Europe's desperation and free-fall can be better concealed...but hey, even in an animated movie, the denizens of Europe looked positively miserable and frightened. The baddie in this movie after all, is a crazy woman and her fanatical henchmen..bent on hunting and killing as many animals as possible to fill-up her trophy collection.Since cannibalism seems to be in fashion again, this movie makes a pretty good case for it...just watch it and you'll see...Anyways, yeah take your kid to see this one, Dreamworks is about the only studio whose animation division has given Pixar a run for its money, the only thing that drags all of them down, are the endless sequels they subject their movies too...enough of that!!!",Null,0,2,25 June 2012
Spectre," Good Bye Daniel Craig...Hello Idris Elba!
","'Quantum Solace' is a better movie than 'Spectre'... there I said it... and you read it! First, before all the Bond purists and fanboys tear my head off, let me say that I myself am not, nor ever was a Bond fan. I am more particular to one guy... Bourne... Jason Bourne! However after Daniel Craig stepped into Bond's shoes and after what was arguably a solid, well made movie, 'Casino Royale' (one of the best Bond movies to date), I couldn't help but take notice, and just as a moviefan in general, I cannot and will not ignore a good movie and not give credit where credit is due, Bond included, fan or not. I have seen the subsequent movies under Craig's tenure as Bond, not on the big screen, except 'Skyfall' and this latest instalment, 'Spectre', and enjoyed them to various degrees.Not 'Spectre'! I did not go in to this movie with high expectations, as I am not a Bond fan, as I've already said. As such, I did not have a lot ridding on this movie. But after the fun spectacle that was 'Skyfall',I did at least expect to be entertained... and that did not happen on this occasion.I knew something was off right out the gate, with the opening credit sequence which is soo pompous to a degree that it parodies itself, even though the Bond opening credits are meant to be over the top. In this case it did not work. Also, Sam Smith's 'Writing's On The Wall' is a generic, self-congratulatory audio mediocrity basically screaming at you and pointing to itself, 'See, see, I'm a Bond song!' ugh... too bad because Sam Smith's vocals and reliability as a crooner, paired with the right lyrics and rhythms usual produce a decent pop song. Not this one.A special mention must go to the soundtrack... as in how bad and annoying it is. The continuous, grinding, grating up-tempo of the soundtrack starts out being a minor annoyance and ends up making you want to get out of your seat and leave the theatre. It is incessant and it feels like it never stops, like you are meant to always expect something jumping at you from the screen... I was exhausted by the end of the movie, in large part because of the soundtrack, it made me feel while watching this movie, that there was never a moment of peace and quiet throughout.So yes, 'Spectre'... is too long...and too boring. It does have some highlights and some bright spots here and there, but I don't want to give anything away except to say that for me if there was a standout scene, it was the opening of the movie which takes place in Mexico City... and then the movie goes downhill from there and flounders all over the place. A mediocre villain, an always reliable but largely interchangeable and forgettable supporting cast (gone is the larger than life on screen presence Dame Judy Dench brought to these movies)and not much else. The Bond girls, or I should say women... well, besides Monica Bellucci who actually seemed appropriate for the movie in her oh so brief appearance, the rest are well, they aren't. Naomi Harris has always been a 'meh' for me. And Lea Seydoux, while a good actress, is completely miscast in this movie. As I said above, the villain is mediocre...(nothing even approaching Javier Bardem's baddie!) yes indeed... as seems to be the curse of many movies these days... movie studios just don't seem to want to be good at portraying bad... In 'Spectre', the bad guy, is meant to be this all-powerful and almost omni-present arch- villain to Bond, a barely there, shadowy figure existing in the background twilight only... well, again... it doesn't work! Christoph Waltz, another usually reliable, and good actor, just fades quickly in this movie after he is revealed and becomes a generic cliché.If you haven't seen any of the previous Bond movies with Daniel Craig, 'Casino Royale', 'Quantum Of Solace' and 'Skyfall', then my advice is to try and see them beforehand, because in 'Spectre', characters, events and places from the previous three movies are mentioned at various points, and if you don't know what they mean, you won't get an explanation. 'Spectre' is NOT really a standalone movie. Point being, that everything that has happened in the previous three movies, and everything that has befallen James Bond, has had one continuous thread, one leading to this one organization which is behind everything, that organization being Spectre...So yes, the movie is too long, all over the place and just feels flat and not that exciting, which is what Bond movies usually trade on to be successful. If I had to classify Daniel Craig's Bond movies they would come out like this: 1. 'Casino Royale', 2. 'Skyfall', 3. 'Quantum Of Solace', 4. 'Spectre'.The main problem is also Daniel Craig himself. While usually competent in his delivery,unfortunately in this movie, more than in the other three before, it feels like he is just phoning his performance in. In a recent interview Craig said something to the effect that 'he would rather slash his wrists' than act in another Bond movie, pretty much signalling that he is kind of done with the franchise... or as the Sam Smith song would say, 'Writing's On The Wall'... and it is time for Craig to bow out and exit! 'Spectre' is not exactly the best way to end things for him as Bond... but better this than another, potentially worse, instalment down the road! On that note, yeah, we need a change...so please bring in Idris Elba!!!! I'll settle for Tom Hardy... but no Damian Lewis...6 out of 10",Null,1,10,6 November 2015
Moon," I Think Therefore I Am
","In the interest of full disclosure I posted this comment on the movie as a message on a general posting thread, and being somewhat lazy I did not want to make-up and entirely new one for this section of IMDb. So here it goes...At one point Sam Rockwell's character observes that 'we are people not a programme' (I am paraphrasing here)...and this single truth defines the substance and essence of 'Moon'.This was the first sci-fi movie in a few years outside the Star Wars or Star Trek universes. The last movie I saw in theaters was Danny Boyle's 'Sunshine'. That was a fine film, but in its last act it kind of descended in pure weirdness and not in a good way, just an all-over-the-place mumbled and non-cohesive ending, for the sake of weirdness. It is too bad because the movie started promising enough.Over the past couple of years we saw a few of these movies trying to fit into the more purist take on science fiction and eschew the sci-fi space opera genre. We had some unsuccessful attempts like 'Mission To Mars' and 'The Red Planet' and some which I quite like, I'm thinking of the excellent but highly underrated 'Solaris' by Stephen Sodebergh and James Cameron which I truly enjoyed and liked, and consider better than Tarkovsky's version. As I read Stanislaw Lem's novel, I found Sodebergh's version to be much closer to the vision and essence of Lem's work...Now we get 'Moon', and yes it is quite a good movie, although its limited release will ensure very few people will get to see it and enjoy it. On line downloads as well as a DVD release should see that situation at least somewhat redressed. It deals with some interesting and provocative themes and ideas and its take on the subject matter is quite well and effectively presented in a great and solid but understated manner.Yes the comparison to both 'Solaris', and '2001: A Space Odyssey' is warranted as the movie does borrow certain elements and ideas from those previous movies. But I still found it really interesting and worthy of at least one viewing.Sam Rockwell is really good in his role and I surely hope that an Oscar nomination is in the cards for him. I have not rated it as high as the average here on IMDb, but I can say with confidence that this is one of the best movies I have seen so far this year. As usual it will get drowned by the summer blockbuster cavalcade and the mindlessness of its much bigger and I daresay stupider cousins like 'Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen' and 'Terminator Salvation'. It is curious that this movie was released during the summer, I would have thought that a fall release would have been more appropriate for such a movie, since that is traditionally the period when award contenders are released. This year those are so far and few between.I hope more people see this film and give it a chance and not shut it down because they see it through the Kubkick or Tarkovsky/Sodebergh lens. It might make you think a bit and teach something at the same time, and these days that is indeed priceless!",Null,2,4,6 July 2009
Mad Max: Fury Road," Sidekick Max and the Victoria Secret Models!
","'Mad Max Fury Road' was a complete letdown and a complete crap fest of a movie. I thought this was going to be the highlight of the summer movie season, a movie season drowning in mediocre superhero flicks and resurrected dino-crap...yes I'm looking at you 'Age Of Ultron' and 'Jurasic World'.I was soo looking forward to Miller's newest take on the Mad Max franchise. It is not even close to the first two movies and even weaker and worse than 'Beyond Thunderdome'. A crummy and unnecessary 3D conversion, badly edited, terrible script, idiotic plot and meaningless storyline...and just an incoherent cacophony of sights and sounds desperately grasping at some kind of nostalgic replay..which doesn't succeed in the least. The original trilogy is miles ahead (pun intended). People are just soo underwhelmed by the yoke of Marvel continuously spewing their mindless drivel, that they are trying desperately to latch on to any movie that seems, or pretends to be different. But 'Fury Road' is not different from its spandex clad cinematic brethren. The relentless nature and frenetic pacing are meant to convey the wild and crazy imagination of George Miller. But if Miller was a visionary, as all the promo captions loudly proclaim, that was in the past, 30 years ago. Now the most vision he has is what brand of adult diapers he will choose to buy...because this movie has nothing 'visionary' about it! It is just pretentious hogwash, supported by audience members and critics who desperately need to convince themselves that this movie is the Second Coming! Anyone who thinks or says different....is to be shunned and exiled to the Wasteland...only in the case of 'Fury Road' that was Namibia and not the actual Australian Outback.This movie is supposedly rated R/14A, but I never got that feeling all throughout the movie. There is more violence, gore and mature themes in a single episode of 'The Walking Dead' or 'Game Of Thrones'! And also more quality.When Tom Hardy (an excellent actor) as Max, turns out to be second fiddle to Charlize Theron's (an over-hyped and overrated actress if I ever saw one) Imperatora Furiosa, the movie takes a sharp dive. When they parade the Victoria Secret models, aka the wives of the villain whose name is...whatever...because he is irrelevant, as the raison d'etre of the movie...then it becomes bad. When the resolution of the movie is to return from where they started out, after being chased for almost the entire movie in the opposite direction, then 'Fury Road' crashes, burns...and finally becomes...crap! The original Mad Max trilogy, well at least the first two movies, were a big-punk-rock-counterculture middle finger to mainstream society and the socio-political and economic environment of the late 70's and early 80's.The current incarnation is but a pale shadow! 'Mad Max Fury Road' is a conformist, corporate driven, empty spectacle pretending to be something it is not...original and visionary. It is a by-the-numbers, test-audience dictated exercise in mediocrity.Boy this will be a looooong summer at the movies...and not in a good way!",Null,12,31,16 May 2015
Warcraft," Why Jesus gave up on the world....after seeing 'Warcraft'...
","Well, if you are one of those people who've asked themselves, why has Jesus forsaken the world, and when is he coming back?! Your answers are, because of 'Warcraft' and never.I am not familiar with the game (games?!), so I am not judging them. The movie, while based on the game and perhaps appealing primarily to that fan base, should also try, at least try, to appeal to wider audiences who are perhaps not familiar with it.Well it doesn't! This movie is unforgivingly boring, the cast is sub par and so is the acting...the directing and the production values are just underwhelming! Besides, seeing Ruth Negga and Dominic Cooper share the screen yet again, I can see why the TV series 'Preacher' over on AMC sucks...'Warcraft' also amounts to visual plagiarism of 'The Lord Of The Rings' and 'The Hobbit' movies...something it doesn't even try to hide.I had high hopes, then just hope, then reasonable expectations, that 'Warcraft' would deliver the kind of fun, well made, summer popcorn movie entertainment we've been missing. But it doesn't do any of those things. Instead 'Warcraft' joins a long line of lame, crummy, lacklustre and failed video game adaptations.I think that Jesus saw this movie...and suddenly realized he died for nothing, so he said 'F **k it!' and then cancelled the Second Coming...'Warcraft' is basically larping with a $170 million dollars budget!",Null,12,21,24 June 2016
