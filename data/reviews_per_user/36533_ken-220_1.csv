The Blair Witch Project," That was the worst film I've ever seen!
","Happiness is never again having to worry about walking out of a theatre saying: 'That was the worst film I've ever seen.' I've already seen the worst film I will ever see and it was the Blair Witch Project!! I'm happy for those of you who liked the film, but for me it was pure torture (not even a good 'this is terrible' laugh). Briefly:  Not scary; Characters had me rooting for whatever was supposed to be in the woods; Only tense moment was fear that someone would pick up the camera at the end and that the movie wasn't really over!!",1,1,2,9 August 1999
