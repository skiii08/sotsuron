The Lobster," Vile piece of garbage. We walked out.
","I've seen a LOT of bad films in my life. This ranks at the top.Absolutely one of THE WORST films I have ever seen. Didn't even make it through the entire film. We walked out after the woman kills the dog and we are shown the bloody proof, dead dog on floor surrounded by blood. Just one of the worst moments in a film.Collin Farrell (don't even care if I spell his name correctly) should be ashamed of himself and frankly, if you consider the vile nature of the film and how he looks in it, his career hopefully is finished. His big belly is a turn off.Completely unredeemable. To be avoided at all costs.",1,5,11,12 June 2016
Blade Runner 2049," Much more enjoyable on second viewing.
","When I first saw Blade Runner in the theaters it was not my favorite film. It seemed obscure, hard to relate to, I couldn't get into it. Maybe being young I was wanting something more friendly, more lightweight. I knew it was something special but I couldn't relate to it.
Decades later I saw Blade Runner on DVD and I fell in love with it. It just seemed so timely. When I first saw Blade Runner 2049 I thought it was a mess and I couldn't relate to it. I thought they blew it. But.....months later I've re-watched it and.......I like it! It isn't perfect, I'm not quite sure of the beginning, seems a little grim but I do like it.It would be nice if the hologram partners could have been male. Why does a helpful, loving hologram ALWAYS have to be some sweet, slightly vulnerable female? Starting to become predictable and tired.May have to see this twice to really get it. Give it a chance.",6,0,5,25 June 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Beautiful production, lot's of action but empty
","On Stranger Tides is beautifully produced and shot with great sets and scenery and lots of action right in your face with rapid editing. Great costumes, great dialog, great acting. The only problem is, it's all rather boring. Even the fight scenes seem rather tired and unoriginal.Depp as usual does a very good job with Sparrow and is quite funny here & there but I found myself becoming very tired very quickly and afterward felt glad to be back outside in the sun when it was over.The film is long, over 2 hours. Not much of that two hours is spent on dialog and story. Some people might not want that but then the rest just seems rather empty and distracting for the sole purpose of being distracting.I loved the first film but all the mystery seems to be gone from this franchise. I hear Mr. Depp will not be playing Sparrow again and maybe even he knows, it's time to retire this.",5,3,6,22 May 2011
10 Cloverfield Lane," A wild roller-coaster ride.
","I love the film and am trying to figure out how to write a review without giving anything away. A woman on the road at night is suddenly in an accident. When she wakes up you immediately start wondering what direction this film could go in. It could go down several different paths. You think you've got it all figured out. Based upon what you are seeing, there really is no other way to go. Wrong.At some point things seem to settle into some harmonious normalcy but then things get ugly and disturbing. Always were a bit disturbing but more ominous.The acting is excellent by everyone, the twists and turns very good especially since these three characters are in an underground bunker. It is edge of your seat, leaning forward intensity. A wild ride for sure. Check it out!",9,99,165,13 March 2016
It," So dull I was falling asleep.
","1 star. Awful. Why? They stripped it of all it's mystery and instead made a bombastic movie that is NOT interesting, not engrossing, not scary. It is DULL! I was falling asleep during the dialog. The characters aren't interesting and the actors aren't interesting. The only pleasant thing about the entire film is the scenery.This is a screeching, loud, overdone film that lacks any fascination. The first film with Tim Curry draws you in and doesn't let go until the spider comes out of the cave. Then, it loses it's audience. This film loses it's audience in the first 10 minutes and they are gone, not to be drawn back in. People were looking at their watches. Just go get the original on DVD or re-read the book. This is BAD.",1,6,11,24 September 2017
Hereditary," A meandering mess
","Unfortunately, the film makers couldn't really decide what they wanted this to be about so they tried to make it about everything. Loss, family relations, death, hope. They tried to put it all in one film instead of focusing on two issues.
What resulted is a meandering mess of issues and familiar scenes borrowed from other films. The atmosphere in most scenes is good. The quality is there but there is no clarity. After the film was over 3 of us were discussing it and it just didn't add up.If the coven needed a male why wasn't the son of the daughter targeted or groomed? Nothing was made clear. Instead, the interest was in cheap tricks to scare the audience. The acting is good but Toni and Gabriel both deserved something better.Skip it.",2,9,21,11 June 2018
Argo," Excellent. Sometimes Hollywood does surprise me
","If you are looking for excellent acting, drama, humor and edge of your seat suspense then this is the film for you. This is intense without CGI. You see, Hollywood can do this when a good story comes along if they put their minds to it. All of the actors do a wonderful job, the story moves along at a great pace and the direction is fine. Nothing negative here. One added little trivial bonus if I may; so fun seeing all the old Western Electric telephones. Remember when that was all we had? How long will we get to keep our old telephones? Enjoy the film, it's a 10.",10,1,1,2 March 2013
The Secret in Their Eyes," Haunting
","Just saw this tonight and thought it was very good.It started out a bit dry and my first reaction was 'this isn't very interesting'. When the story gets going though it is very good, quite interesting and even has some humor in it although it isn't a happy film.My companion thought the story was depressing and in a way it is, sometimes people build their own prisons and that doesn't make an uplifting story. But the acting here is very good and the passion of the characters sucks you into what is happening.I really enjoyed the film and recommend it.",9,2,4,30 May 2010
Terminator Salvation," I miss Arnold and Linda
","The first two sucked you in and didn't let go. Linda Hamilton, Micheal Biehn and Arnold created entertaining characters and you didn't want the films to end.This 4th entry is mindless, uncreative, schlocky and so over the top. Here Christian Bale is thrown up against walls, beat up and even impaled and still manages to get up and even give a quick nod as he lies on a gurney with a few little wraps of gauze on his chest. Does Hollywood really think we'll buy into this?This film offers nothing new at all. It's exactly what you think it is. Just watch the first two over again.",4,1,3,18 June 2009
Silent Hill," Can you handle one more review?
","Just watched Silent Hill. I never played the game and know nothing about it. My review is simply based on the film itself. First of all, the movie is waaayyyy too long. If it had been 30 minutes shorter it would have helped. The production is excellent. As is the acting, sets, demon costumes and direction. However, there were 2 scenes that weren't good. You will know what they are when you see them. The first hour I was riveted and impressed! The 2nd hour I started to tire a bit-it became a bit repetitive. That's what I mean when I say it should have been shorter. Sometimes short & sweet is best. I can only give it a 7 based on the length and the 2 scenes that had me rolling my eyes. But if you like creepy films, this is quite interesting.",7,0,1,12 July 2008
The Bodyguard," At times lurid but enthralling
","I was hesitant to watch this film. A friend had rented it and ask me to watch it. The acting here is good by most everyone. It is also interesting how you get to see 'behind the scenes' of a person who is a mega-star. You get a little peek into the private life that you might not see otherwise.At times the film feels lurid and soapy. But other times it is fascinating. Kevin Costner did a very good job here and looks so handsome. He really gave his character life here. Whitney Houston also does a good job and it wasn't any stretch at all to believe her portrayal of the big star singer. Probably a film that women would enjoy more than men but despite the flaws, I did enjoy it. I don't think it ever became too sappy. I think the reason for the attacks on the star are probably the weakest point of the film.",8,2,5,2 August 2009
Shutter Island," Really, we've seen this film before.
","Shutter Island has been done before. With different actors, a bit different formula, some different twists and turns but it's been done before.There really isn't anything new here. Leo does a very good job with the acting as he usually does. So far, I enjoy watching his films however, truth be told, this isn't anything inventive or new. I had the story figured out long before it ended and I'm sure everyone else did too.I'm not saying the movie is bad or poorly done but I'm not sure what the point of the film is. Lot of people here seem to love it and that's great but for me it was a waste of time.",7,0,1,5 August 2010
Empire of the Sun," Well,...not my favorite film
","I am going to go out on a limb here and say this as honest as I can; this is not my favorite film. But there is a reason for this-I didn't like any of the characters and that includes the boy played by Christian Bale. I know I'm supposed to feel strong feelings for this kid but I didn't. I did feel empathy for him when he was alone in his house but after that I didn't feel much. There was something missing from the performance here-frankly, he wasn't a warm character. In fact, there isn't even one character that I truly loved in this film and for me that is very, very unusual. I like all types of films and I think my collection reflects that. But this didn't work for me. Therefore, I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone. I found the documentary that comes with the film much more interesting than the film itself. I know I'll catch a lot of flack for this one but I just wanted the film to be over and I was relieved when it was.",4,6,12,21 September 2009
The Godfather: Part II," Not as captivating as The Godfather
","As far as sequels go this isn't awful. A lot of money went into this and the acting is excellent by everyone. The sparkle and grit and realism that appears in almost every frame of The Godfather just isn't here. Some of this seemed forced and contrived and overall the story is quite grim and depressing. Even in The Godfather there were a few scenes here and there that were light and slightly amusing. You get none of that here. Everything here is black.I also think that this a little bit too long. I think it could have moved faster. All in all it isn't something I would watch a second time. Not like the original, which is a product of it's time.",6,4,9,6 May 2012
Nightcrawler," Wow!
","Here's an edge of your seat suspense/drama. Or maybe that isn't the correct way to describe this excellent film. Maybe action suspense?All I know is that the acting is EXCELLENT by everyone. Rene Russo delivered her best performance in my opinion. Jake also did an amazing job with his character, really fleshing out the sickness underneath the outward vulnerability. This is an intense, riveting film that keeps you interested from the very start. All the scenes choreographed just perfectly to make the audience feel as if they are there. There are great action scenes that recall films like The French Connection or Bullet. And suddenly, everything is eerily still holding the audience captivated, waiting for the next shoe to drop.You don't want to miss this.",10,8,14,30 November 2014
Grease," Very dated but colorful
","I first saw this when it came out and remember very little about it. I did not like it when I first saw it and never watched again since. Just recently, I saw the film again. Let me start by saying it is vibrant, colorful and energetic. Everyone looks good in their costumes and make up and everyone is young. Amazing that everyone was smoking but things have changed since this movie was made. So much so that all I could think of was how dated this film is. I found myself wincing during some of the dance scenes. The jerky, odd movements on the bleachers and around the car being 'souped up'. If memory serves me I didn't like these scenes when the film was new so watching them today was a bit startling. The dialogue in some parts of the film is very strange too. No one talks like that anymore thank goodness.Despite the fact that I didn't like the entire film I have to say that I couldn't take my eyes off of it and it did leave an impression. The opening animated sequence is a one of a kind-you don't see many films start out like that anymore. Did Car Wash use something like that as well? I might have to watch the film again but some of this film seems so strange I can't imagine why this would be anyone's favorite film!",5,1,3,8 September 2008
Split," A letdown of an ending
","The film starts out interesting enough and grabs your attention. No problem there. Then, it shifts and starts down a road similar to 'Kiss the Girls'. Again though, keeping your attention. But it's sort of a cop-out, who wants to see young teenage girls held captive against their will? We can relate- the situation would leave anyone in a panic.Then it becomes a bit predictable when the girls try to escape several times. I mean, this is what we want right?Betty Buckley's dialog becomes a bit tedious at times and I rolled my eyes at the psychobabble. We've all heard it. Then we work through some suspense and finally make it to the ending and........THAT is where the big disappointment hits us. It's not only a letdown and completely unbelievable but then, there is an addition that just makes no sense whatsoever even after it has been explained to me. Frankly, I think I'm giving up on Sheyamalyn films and I don't even care if I didn't spell his name correctly. Yo know what his problem is? No one in Hollywood is willing to say NO to him!",7,17,44,18 March 2017
The Hills Have Eyes," Hills Have Eyes Again!
","I actually liked this! I watched it hesitantly because I always liked the original and didn't want to see some slick, watered down, CGI version. The original is somewhat gritty-something Hollywood can't do anymore. In fact, I avoided it in the theaters and didn't watch it until it came out on DVD. But I finally watched it and was pleasantly surprised. It was tense and tight and the acting was certainly better than the original. I missed Michael Berryman as Pluto. He has so much character. But the cast here is good and movie moved right along. Short & sweet-just how I like my horror. It's too bad the remakes of Texas Chainsaw Massacre weren't as good as this.",8,0,0,12 July 2008
Knowing," Enthralling-love it!!
","Just watched this and loved it. The film is well made. The acting is fantastic, the story great and the dialogue good. The mood and atmosphere of the film makes it easy to become drawn into the story. It's a science fiction prophecy film. A little girl adds something to a time capsule at her school that is opened 50 years later. Her gift was numbers. But the numbers mean something. I won't say here what they are but they do mean something to society.But was the information meant to be shared? Perhaps not. She was getting a prophetic message from someone but why? Watch it and find out.",10,4,9,12 July 2009
Quantum of Solace," Spoiler? What is there to spoil?
","I find it amusing we are warned that if we write a spoiler without warning readers we will be added to a blacklist and our future comments will be discarded. How can you write a spoiler about a movie that moves so fast and is edited so quickly that you can't comprehend what is really happening? But that's the point isn't it? We're not supposed to look too deep because frankly, there isn't anything there. This is like an MTV video that goes on way too long. Half way through the film I had a very vague idea of what the so called story was but I didn't really care so if I didn't understand anything after the first half, it made no difference to me. There are maybe 2 scenes in which the actors sit and talk about something but it just skims over the surface and amounts to very little. Quick editing, faced paced in your face action, exotic locale and big, big yawn!",1,10,18,25 January 2009
District 9," Raw, Savage and Gritty
","Wow! I don't know if I should write about this right after seeing it but I'm going to anyway.The words I would use to describe this film; raw, savage, intense, gritty, horrifying, terrifying, sad, pathetic, grim.The film is well done. It is NOT what I expected at all. Imagine you are watching a documentary about a true story and they are showing you actual footage from live feeds as it happened.Basically, an alien space ship drifts toward earth and stalls over Johannesburg Africa. It hovers for about 4 months before humans travel up to the ship, cut their way in and bring down the 1 million starving aliens.What happens after that parallels what happens down here on earth when one group no longer wants the other around. It is horrific.With intense scenes, good acting, good cgi and a good idea brought to the screen I think most people will find this very interesting.",10,0,2,16 January 2010
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," It has everything you would expect. It's all there.
","What can I say? It's a fast paced, over the top action film with rapid editing and information thrown at you just as fast as Tom Cruise can run and fly through the air.It's got everything you would expect. It also has good acting, good dialogue, humor, great sets and stunts, breathtaking photography and of course, a cool car near the end. It isn't something I would watch again. Films like this throw a lot of information at you and after a while I personally didn't even try to keep up with the story or the details. I just watched the film and enjoyed it. It is enjoyable. Just not something to sit through twice unless you need almost 3 hours of mind numbing action. It sounds so uncool to say this but sometimes I wish they could pull in the reigns just a bit. Just a bit less information, a bit less action and of course, the actors can survive any injury and still go on. A bit overdone but still fun.",7,1,3,1 January 2012
Revolutionary Road," Fear & Bravery
","One of the characters in the film says, 'a man gets maybe 2 chances where a good opportunity is presented to him and he better take it by the balls when he can or he might find himself sitting in a place he doesn't want to be and wondering how he got there.' Maybe that isn't exactly how it is phrased but it's close and it's the message of the film.If you really, really want to change your life you must have courage and be very brave. A lot of us are very comfortable and familiar with our lives and comfortable with the familiarity. If this seems like a lot to take in then you might want to avoid this film. The couple in the film struggle with their own desires and dreams for themselves and for their relationship. When an opportunity comes up to move to Europe it invigorates them and makes them feel alive! Yet, when things don't quite work out as planned they have problems.Very good acting, very good sets and costumes.",9,0,0,18 July 2009
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Beautiful to look at but oddly lacks punch
","I agree with Richard Finch here. Here is a visually beautiful film that obviously required talent to bring to the screen. Much money went into the lavish and beautiful sets, even that of a cave dweller who probably has more beautiful things than most people do in urban America. The cinema photographer also did a wonderful job filming a China a lot of Chinese people probably don't ever get to see. So, what is wrong with the film? Unfortunately, the characters really aren't all that deep. It's a pretty formulaic story and a familiar one as well. Unrequited love that isn't actually spoken of much until it's too late. The fight sequences, though beautiful are so far fetched they are distracting and pull us out of the story. I kept thinking of Kill Bill and how it just packs a punch, hits you right in the gut and it just all works. We also can really relate to the characters in Kill Bill and they've got grit!Here, a lot just seems sort of tepid. Not a bad film by any means but nothing super spectacular either.",7,0,1,8 April 2013
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Disappointing
","8.1? Really? This film meanders aimlessly going nowhere. There are basically two different stories and the scenes don't add up to much. There is nothing invigorating or interesting happening. Sharon Tate at the theater watching her own film, smiling? So what? Amateurs could have pulled that off.Let me cut to the quick here-the very best part of this film, literally, is the last 10 minutes. And frankly, anyone could have pulled that off too.This is Quinton Tarantino? The same man who supposedly made Kill Bill? So then I have to ask; who really made Kill Bill?",1,14,21,1 September 2019
Insidious," Wow! Scary, creepy film
","Insidious does what it is supposed to do. Scare people. And it is effective at that little task. A small boy travels in his dreams but goes too far and can't get back. That leaves an empty vessel to inhabit and the tortured souls that want that vessel will do whatever they can to prevent the boy from coming back.Sound scary? It is. Some of the dialog was a bit predictable. There were three scenes that seemed rather trite. Aside from those small missteps though, this movie scared me. Very effectively I might ad. Don't watch it alone. It'll make you start to look into dark areas of your house.",8,0,0,26 February 2012
2012," Yuck! A quick review
","Had this film been made for TV during the mid 70's when I was a kid I might have been much more forgiving. However, in 2010 I expect more.The film is highly implausible with the main characters always just being missed by falling debris during a major disaster wherever they happen to go.What really bothered me was the fact that the President was being urged to make a statement to the people long after the fact that half the country had been destroyed! Excuse me, no one has televisions anymore and you want to address the country? Idiotic.It's too bad that John Cusack accepted this. This is a tired, stupid disaster film and I won't sit through it ever again.",1,1,3,8 March 2010
I Am Legend," The book is better!
","And that is true-the book IS better. After I finished reading it I couldn't stop thinking about it. This movie could have been better had they followed the book more closely. Will Smith's acting is very good but I think there are several other actors that could have done this part.The first half of the film is engrossing and interesting. The 2nd half bothers me. A woman seeking refuge in Vermont finds Will Smith and is able to pull him from his overturned vehicle even though she weighs in at half of his weight. The acting in the 2nd half becomes strained. But worse, the nightseekers are suddenly able to figure out where Will Smith lives and break into his house throwing him through furniture, staircase rails, down the stairs and of course, he can still get up and function with minimal injury. I found myself loosing interest at this point. You can tell they were trying to cater to the very young demographic instead of going for something gritty & mysterious. In other words, they sold out in parts of the film.I asked my friend what he thought of the film after it ended in the theater and he threw up his hands & said, 'it's a movie-what do you want?'",7,0,2,20 January 2008
Call Me by Your Name," Tedious
","We've seen this story before in different situations and with different characters. But some of those other stories added some humor and moved the story along a bit quicker. This is way too long, and drags in some scenes.As a gay man I can tell you I was touched by some of it but I'm quite sure not everyone is going to enjoy this. It's actually a bit of a downer.It's sad that people, gay people especially, have had to shut off their feelings in the past or in some areas of the world. When you think of how powerful those feelings of love are it's painful to watch this.But do you really want to see that in a film? I don't.",5,6,19,15 January 2018
Gran Torino," Wasn't expecting laughs
",I had put off watching this because I didn't want to see something in a film that I've seen in person but the film is so well made with such interesting characters I couldn't help but love it.I wasn't expecting humor but I laughed through most of it. I suppose all different kinds of people will see this and laugh also. It sort of breaks the ice a bit.Clint is a Vietnam Veteran who lives in an area becoming populated by Hmuongs. At first he is put off by them but soon he becomes friends with some and defends them from gang members.The acting is top notch and the script is very good.,10,1,6,14 July 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Enjoyable, interesting but too long.
","It seems that people are divided into 2 camps-they either love this or hate it. Some find it pointless.Simply put; the film is about our fear of what we will become. What the future holds for us. For the young, they see old people and some probably fear the idea they will become old. In this case, things are different for Benjamin Button. The film also seems to be about timing. How we sometimes meet the love of our life but perhaps aren't ready for it or too immature to realize what is in front of us. I think it's also about caring for the ones we love when they can no longer care for themselves. The film is very well acted by everyone. The photography is beautiful. I think the film could have been shorter though. It does seem to be a bit too long. I can think of a couple of scenes that could have been shortened without affecting the film.I didn't find it depressing and it certainly is a unique idea for a film. If you enjoy drama this would probably be your thing.",9,0,2,4 August 2009
Children of Men," No deep thoughts here
","What happens when our society realizes it has no future? What happens when women are no longer fertile? And what happens when a woman conceives after 18 years of the world experiencing human infertility? Does it change the events of the world? This is all fascinating to speculate on, to read about, to ponder. The premise sounds like it would make a fantastic movie. However, it doesn't. The movie never really gives us anything meaty to sink our teeth into. I wanted to know what people thought about what was happening. I thought of my own workplace and knew people would be talking about it constantly. Where was all of this in the film? Nowhere. A thought crept into my mind during several scenes; I've seen these scenes before. Yawn. And the ending? Abrupt at best. 3 of us saw this tonight and 3 of us were disappointed.",3,2,7,28 January 2007
Guardians of the Galaxy," Fun, but too long
","Guardians of the Galaxy is a fun science fiction comedy with an interesting cast of characters and great acting. The CIG is also very good for CGI. The film moves at a fast pace but the story is a bit muddled at times. It becomes a bit lost in itself.The comedy bits are great and the timing couldn't be better however, the film becomes a bit wearying after the hour and a half mark. During the last 30 minutes all I could think of is I want to get off this ride now, I'm finished. It was like being stuck on a carnival ride and knowing you were ready to for it to end.All in all it is very entertaining if a bit tongue in cheek. All of the actors did a great job and there are truly some unique characters here, especially the tree/humanoid who is wise but has a limited vocabulary.Fun for sure but just too long.",8,0,3,21 September 2014
Jurassic World," Good but nothing original here
","Jurassic World as a stand alone film is good. Had I not seen the previous Jurassic films I would have enjoyed this, found it entertaining. I find this a nice addition to the previous three films. The acting is excellent by all, the production high. Only issue I have is that nothing new really happens. People show up at Jurassic World, something goes wrong, people die and the park is ruined. Same format, same formula, no real new ideas. Can't blame the writers for this. What else could be done with the story? One other issue I have with the film is that it doesn't really build up as much tension as the previous. There are a few moments here and there that do but when one of the characters is in a very dangerous situation, there is a lack of build-up, a lack of suspense. All in all very good but not all that original.",8,5,13,14 June 2015
Paranormal Activity," I got goosebumps-literally
","I got goosebumps while watching this and that NEVER happens to me. I've sat through many, many horror films and have relished every scary minute. I am so glad I'm in a condo complex with people above, below and beside me at every wall! Literally, I am so glad I'm not in a big house-especially alone. If I was I wouldn't be staying here tonight. True, the film is low budget but we knew this going in. True, there aren't many characters and it is low tech but does any of that matter if it scares you? No! I don't believe any of the people saying that they weren't scared. I don't. I'm pretty level headed and I was effected by this. Not perfect but did exactly what they set out to do.",9,1,2,17 November 2009
Elysium," The LONGEST hour and 45 minutes of my life.
","Poor Jody Foster. All those great films, all that hard work in Hollywood, all that great acting and here she is, in a boring, tedious, mindless piece of garbage pumped out by the Hollywood factory in the only way they can make films now. Predictable idiocy, trite script, no brain work required.And Matt Damon. A once promising actor in some pretty damn good work too and now this. He's sunk into a brainless project that must leave him feeling depressed.This film is just like all the other action films. I can't even tell them apart anymore! This could be any of the junky action films released in the last 2 years. This could have been a cerebral, low key, dramatic film. Sooo very disappointing. Only brainless idiots will enjoy this.Really sad.",1,1,4,2 September 2013
Alice in Wonderland," Nothing enchanting here
","Alice in Wonderland 3-D isn't an enchanting Disney film. Nor is it engrossing. Alice seems depressed and the Mad Hatter seems like he needs a bath very, very soon. The 3-D special effects didn't seem all that great to me.The movie is not uplifting nor is it funny. I can't imagine any children seeing this and finding it entertaining. A couple of scenes actually turned my stomach. I'll give you a hint; a surly mouse with a sharp needle around living beings can lead to some painful moments. None of the characters here seem like they're having much fun and watching these miserable people and animals is kind of a drag. I kept thinking of the animated Alice in Wonderland and wishing that were up on the screen instead. Johnny Depp gives the Mad Hatter some real emotions but he seems dirty-like he needs a good scrubbing. I don't think this will be anybody's favorite film and it wouldn't surprise me if Tim Burton had been absent a lot during the filming.",5,1,3,14 March 2010
Avatar," Can you stand another review?
","I just saw this with 2 other people tonight on December 26th and we all loved it. One thing that came to mind watching this film; it's going to be hard to top. The CGI, and this film is a CGI fest, is top notch with exception of a few little scenes here and there. Anyone working on a CGI film going forward is going to have to work very, very hard. Also, the acting is top notch by everyone in my opinion. You may not like the human characters but the actors did a good job. Some of the story is quite predictable-we've seen some of this before. I can't say the story is original however, there are very original components to the story that keep it fresh. Some of the CGI sets are wonderful with phosphorescent plants growing in the forest that the characters walk, run and hunt through. The story is engaging and I don't think the audience had time to think about their cell phones and Blackberries during this. I recommend this. It's a long film but the time flies by.",10,1,3,26 December 2009
Super 8," Maybe I missed something....
","3 of us watched this last night and not one of us thought it was all that terrific. Enjoyable and fun yes. I think kids would enjoy this more than adults.The acting is excellent by everyone although I thought some of acting overdone. The CGI is top notch but the film doesn't really make that much sense. I didn't know a train could be completely derailed by a small pick up truck. Maybe so. Or I missed something. But at times during this I often felt I had missed something. The scenes I found most interesting were too short and not informative enough. When some kids find some hidden footage of film and start to learn more about what is happening in their town I thought 'well, finally, some answers here' but then they are interrupted and the film moves on.All in all OK but nothing earth shattering here. I doubt people will be talking about this 6 months from now.",5,0,2,11 July 2011
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Dull, boring, poorly done, save your money
","Do not waste your time on this dull, idiotic, pointless, boring film. It'd be more entertaining to watch ants marching in a line on the ground. Seriously. This is tedious stuff.First of all, the glossy stills one sees on the Internet have much more clarity than the film and are much more interesting. Those scenes in the film are brief and shown from afar. The dramatic scenes, which are very few, are over before you can register what is happening. Caligula with Malcom McDowell is far more entertaining than this and much better made. You also get a little bit of glossy, graphic porn mixed in. But this? It's just total bottom of the barrel crap. You can't get much lower than this unless you watch some 1960's low budget horror exploitation film. Even worse are the relentless and torturous references to human excrement and re-enactments of that 'event' as it is put in the film. Trust me.....you do NOT want to see this pile of 'that event'.",1,5,14,11 August 2013
The Happening," One of the worst films I've seen
","I doubt anyone will read this. So much has been written before. I just feel compelled to say that this is one of the worst films I've ever seen and I've seen some bad movies. First of all, Mark Wahlberg's acting isn't good. Neither is Zoey Daschanel's. Don't even know if I spelled that right & don't care. The characters aren't likable or interesting at all. None of them. Then, Betty Buckley comes up. Betty Buckley?! Why would anyone cast her? Not that she's a bad actress but I don't see her in this at all. Her character is creepier than whatever is blowing through the trees. The story is ridiculous and what makes it so jarring are the occasional gun shots going off. I wanted to scream! M.Night or whatever his name is loosing it! Just avoid this.",1,4,6,10 June 2009
Zero Dark Thirty," A bit tepid despite good acting.
","The film is about the events which lead to the dispatching of terrorist Bin Laden. Because of the subject matter one might think that this would be a nail biting, white knuckle, edge of your seat suspense drama. It isn't. The pace is comparable to Contagion or Silence of the Lambs. Much more low key and slow. But why? We as the audience aren't really pulled into this and held captive. We aren't caught in the grip. We are watching from a distance. Which is too bad. The acting is excellent, the cast does a very good job. The sets are fantastic. I don't feel the casting is right for this though. As good as the actors are I felt the wrong people were chosen. They just didn't grab me. Also, I think it isn't paced correctly or perhaps the editor didn't have the right footage to work with. It was a bit of a letdown. Not a bad film, I did enjoy it I just don't think it was all it could have been.Most people probably won't watch this twice.",7,2,6,28 March 2013
30 Days of Night," 30 Days of Hiding
","I was all geared up to see this film. Actually, the idea is very intriguing. A small town in Alaska experiences 30 Days of darkness and many people leave the town during this time because they can't handle it. However, some stay by choice-a couple get stranded. Why can't they drive out though? Oh, one gets into an accident and she missed her plane and the others? Well, if you want this to make sense then this movie isn't going to work. And that is the truth. Once darkness comes all the cell phones remaining have been burned in a neat little pile in a snow covered field. And vampires descend upon the town via ship. An old ship out in the water. The remaining people in the town are left to fight off the vampires. But the vampires of course are faster and stronger and so the humans aren't doing too well. The small group of survivors decide they have to hide out and do so briefly in an attic and then later in an office with........windows! We're supposed to believe that they hid out for almost 30 days in an office with windows? Yes. They sort of move around the town for some reason. It isn't explained. I really want to like this film. I suppose some of the action scenes were pretty good. I think there were some creepy scenes. The vampires have a little help from CGI and they appear very strange at times. With oddly distorted faces and black eyes. But not much originality here. You have to accept the stupid writing and accept a banal story for it to work. Not bad but not great either. I think 28 Days Later was much better.",6,1,2,10 March 2008
Inception," Overdone, too long, too complicated, too unrealistic
","Well, after writing my summary maybe I don't need to write a review.First off, this isn't really my type of film. But I watched it and tried to follow it as closely as possible.But the film is way too long, overdone, too complicated and too messy. It is also too literal. Dreams are messy, choppy, chaotic and blurry. For some reason, dreams for this crew are pretty neat and orderly. Sure things seem distorted at times but not in a dream-like manor.And then the films starts to fall into the Hollywood formula with chases, people shooting, people getting shot, blah, blah, blah.I frankly became bored with the entire thing and was glad when it was over. I don't understand all the fuss over this.",4,7,11,30 December 2010
Prometheus," Totally forgettable, rehashed ideas from other films.
","Prometheus starts out a mystery and ends with many questions. What does the opening mean? Neither of us could tell. This is before Alien yet the technology is more advanced than Alien and Alien was further in the future. Also, this advanced technology can show what a person is dreaming while asleep but it can't show what is inside of an ancient, abandoned space ship. It can't show that there are bodies, living and dead, in that same spaceship until much, much later. We were expecting this film to end at a point near where Alien starts but that idea isn't fleshed out completely here. This film is just a mess with ideas sort of flung in the wind that end up not being satisfying. There is a tedious feel to a lot of this. A lot is happening but it isn't very fulfilling nor interesting. The scene that had the most impact is that of a woman crew member who chooses to enter into a surgery booth and have surgery performed on her without anesthetic. The rest was rehash from other films, other ideas we've been exposed to before.Sorry Ridley, this didn't work for me and I won't remember a thing about it 3 months from now. Time for something completely new. I suppose the acting was very good, the film is nice to look at but there isn't anything interesting here.",6,3,5,10 June 2012
The Woman in Black," Great atmosphere but disappointing story
","After reading all the good reviews here a friend of mine and I set out to see this. In the mood for a good horror film we were expecting a dark, scary film that would really make us jump out of our seats or cover our eyes. This didn't happen as much as anticipated. If you've ever seen 'The Others' with Nicole Kidman or 'The Innocents' with Deborah Kerr you know what a good, old fashioned haunted house film can be. You don't need any fancy CGI or special effects. What you do need is a solid story that people can relate to. This film doesn't have that. We were disappointed. Yes, there are a couple of creepy moments but it was more like riding one of those carnival rides that the car moves through on a track with animatronic, robot figures jumping out in front of you with loud screeching sound effects. The sets are beautiful and I suppose the acting is OK although it was no stretch for Radcliff to play this role. I would think that people who don't like scary films would probably find this unnerving but for the rest of us this was a disappointment. The story just doesn't make much sense.",5,9,18,5 February 2012
Casino Royale," Go Bond Go!!
","Glossy, shiny, Bond movie with characters and settings that look like they came right out of a fashion magazine. With over-the-top, carefully choreographed action scenes that are almost non-stop. Anything deep? Mmmmmm, no. Fun for 2 hours? Yes. The only scenes that are low key are during great card games where atrocious amounts of money are laid down. Bond is able to put his body through intense action with injury and recover almost immediately. One torture scene will make every man on the planet cringe. Although this is the only injury Bond receives that requires any convalescence! The locale, sets, costumes are very exotic but the person I went with found the Bond car a bit of a disappointment.",7,1,4,24 November 2006
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Feels like Pedro Almodovar
","If you've ever seen a Pedro Almodovar film certain elements of this film will seem familiar. The film takes place in Spain, partly in Barcelona and there are beautiful sets and scenery.The relationships in the film are complex. Two American girls spend July & August in Spain and meet up with an artist. Both of the girls find the artist attractive but only one is free enough to act on her attraction right away while the other is much more guarded.The film is well done and well shot. It is sunny, vibrant and colorful. There is one thing that bothers me about this film though and I think I wanted more clarity. The end is a bit murky and I think it would have been better if the male character had shown some strength & had been more honest with the women. Just because you are blunt doesn't mean you are being honest.",7,0,1,17 February 2009
Flight," Made me squirm in my seat
","There are a lot of scenes in Flight that are hard to watch. Watching someone totally ruin their life scene after scene isn't fun. At one point, it becomes a bit tedious here but it's meant to be in your face to make a point.The acting here is excellent by everyone. For the most part the story moves along and keeps one interested. I did not find the film boring at all as some have suggested. I found it interesting if disturbing.There were two small scenes that seemed a bit contrived but aside from that I found the film well made and it even has some over the top humor. It's hard to laugh at someone who has hit rock bottom but this film pulls it off. All in all I think most people will enjoy this. It isn't the most original piece but at least it isn't mind numbing over-the-top action with no story.",9,1,2,24 December 2012
Life," Derivative of Alien, Predictable.
","Life is Alien with a different crew and a different monster. That's it. Nothing new, nothing deep, nothing meaningful. Is there suspense? Yes, here and there but again, it is NOTHING NEW! Same situations we've seen a hundred times in a hundred different science fiction films.Let's face it.......Hollywood is out of ideas!",5,3,7,9 April 2017
Moon," Rather grim but probably prophetic
","Well, I have to say that Moon is sad & somewhat depressing. There isn't much here that is uplifting. Unfortunately, Moon is also frighteningly prophetic. At least I think it is. It's sad how Mr. Corporate has infiltrated our society to a degree that movies can depict with strikingly accurate assumptions of what we can expect in the future. It's hard to find an argument about what we are seeing and the theory behind it. It almost makes one feel that death, when it comes, might be a blessing in disguise but enough of that.Moon is well done. The acting is very good. The sets are wonderful and I have to say that the idea is very interesting. However, would I want to sit through it again? Nah. The quality of the film is there and for that I'd give it a 9. As far as how much I enjoyed it? I did but not a lot.",9,0,2,28 January 2010
Mad Max: Fury Road," Way too long, way overdone
","I'm a huge fan of Mad Max and The Road Warrior. There is a believability in those two films. This is way over the top, way too predictable and way too tired. Max now fights like Matt Damon in Bourne Identity which is something new. And now we have CGI added in the mix which takes away the 'Organic' feel of it don't you think?Organic, not a term I like to use but frankly, the first two films did feel that way. This is way too much, way too long and over the top. Also, there aren't too many characters to love here and that's a problem.Lastly, this all seems meaningless and stupid. Go back where you came from after trying so hard to escape? It just all seems so dull and tiresome.",4,20,44,1 August 2015
The Runaways," You probably won't learn much as this is predictable stuff
","The story of the Runaways is an interesting one. Joan Jett wanted to form an all girl rock band and she did with Cherie Currie singing lead vocals on some songs or most songs. There are so many questions that I would love to see answered about The Runaways and Joan Jett and unfortunately, not all of the questions are answered in this film. In fact, very few questions are answered here. We do get to see Kim grooming the band and trying to get the performances out of them that he felt would make them successful but really, we've seen those scenes before in other films. If someone really wanted to get the story of The Runaways out there, why not deliver the story instead of delivering a predictable rock-n-roll band on the road type of story? I almost feel like if I want all my questions answered I would need to read Cherie Currie's book Neon Angel. This film sort of skims over the surface without digging or exposing too much detailed information. It's too bad because I like Joan Jett and Cherie Currie and I wanted to love this film but it just didn't go much past what one would expect from a film telling a story of any all girl rock-n-roll band. It's exactly what you would expect. I doubt anyone will actually learn much here about the individuals themselves.",5,0,0,17 January 2011
The Martian," Enjoyable, thrilling, maybe not completely original
","Well, we just saw this tonight and we both really enjoyed it. Quite a few people are criticizing the film but let me just say that I found it to be very intense and thrilling. It does what it is supposed to do. It is true though, we have seen some of these scenes before in other films.The film is a bit too long. It could have been shorter. I think some of the performances were predictable but it's a movie. At least it wasn't some mindless film with nothing but chase sequences and explosions. I think most people will enjoy this. The acting is great, the production is top notch, it has some humor, the characters are mostly likable.",10,5,48,4 October 2015
