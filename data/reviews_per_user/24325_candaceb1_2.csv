United 93," Documentary with a history lesson
","I could not get comfortable in my seat. I sat in the rear of the theater, a few fidgety like myself. The film did not make me cry,( as I had initially anticipated. I just became angry. It was sad, but more than that it showed how unorganized and chaotic that day was. The most interesting aspect was that names were not used, as far as when each passenger, gov. employee, etc... addressed each other, just delivering lines, I guess like that day, making perfect sense and less script like. I think in that sense, it felt very real and put the observer within action. It was loud towards the end, I cannot even fathom what they went through, but incredible that passengers had the information that they did and made the decisions to fight back. I found myself wishing I had been part of that team that charged the door. One of the better films I have seen recently.",10,5,12,29 April 2006
Into the Wild," Breathing air into Krakauer's pages!
","After a summer of terrible movie experiences, Into the Wild gave a large theater full of Santa Barbarians a pleasant surprise! After reading Krakauers first two books, it was hard to expect the translation would come through as vividly and honestly as seen tonight. One of the most poignant roles was that of Franz, played by Hal Holbrook- who deserves a nod, solely on the basis that he made me cry. This film should touch a nerve in everyone, especially those of us who escaped dis-functional family homes. Really who could blame Christopher? Bravo to the real Chris and bravo x 10 to his on screen actor- Emile Hirsch. The soundtrack was also perfectly tied to the film. Tonight my friend and I needed a reality check, feeling out of balance and unfocused...this film will certainly put your life back in perspective and may even plant the seed of escapism in your minds, as it did ours. Sean Penn- Oscar is written in the stars- again!",10,6,14,6 October 2007
