War Dogs," War Dogs a good movie
","Going into this movie I thought it was gonna be another Jonah Hill comedy movie. Although it did have really good comedy it was an interesting story to follow. This movie blends drama, action, and comedy into a well developed movie. As a person who loves his guns it was a fun one to watch. It is acclaimed that this movie is another version of 'The Wolf of Wall street' and as it is another American dream success story, it is one that is more modern. It has some similarities to the success story of the early 1900's but it just has a different feel to it. The positives in this movie include the great performances by Jonah Hill, Miles Teller and even an interesting character of Bradley Cooper. Even though I thought this whole movie was going to be a comedy, the comedy it did have came at great moments and were stomach hurting laughter. Another thing that was good about the movie was being able to explain the gun selling business in a simple interesting way. It really dives into the whole story of their business and how it affected them and their lives back home. Now for some of the negatives. The end of this movie seems to drag on and on. You think it's about to end but it just keeps going. Also the ending the does happen isn't one to wrap everything up. Some more closure would have been nice but it didn't take away from being a good movie. I give this movie a two thumbs up. I will totally watch it again and advise anyone to see it.",8,0,0,27 November 2016
Creed," Review of Creed
","I have now watched this movie for a fourth time and honestly it gets better every time. This spin off of the Rocky films does just as much justice as the originals do. This movie is not to similar to the first Rocky movie as some may think making it an even better movie. It has the coming up story, the training, and the fight but it all has a different fell because of the characters. Michael B. Jordyn and Sylvester Stallone do a great job of bringing in new emotions and great acting into another boxing movie. What these two do so well is blend together as well as building their character individually. There is a time in the last fight that Stallone looks as intent as he did inside the ring as he does outside of the ring. It feels different when he is on the outside of the ring until this moment. As for Michael it he really makes you feel as though he is truly Apollo's son even though it is just a movie. The best thing that I noticed is how they have a new score for this character and not the old theme. It helps move with the central idea of this film which is this is Donnie's movie. I really loved this movie and for Rocky fans I really recommend this.",10,1,2,27 November 2016
