Come and See," An Intense Eye Opener
","'Come and See,' has been one of the most intense films I had ever seen, by far. I actually felt like I was in the frame. My emotions were hit so deep from this movie. I don't think I can express it all on here. Reason being, is that my father would tell me stories about my German grandfather (who was a Jew, I know that this was filmed in Russia) and his struggle against leaving a country in which he once loved. My father was not very pleased telling me these stories. It always made him very emotional. Now back to the film, just seeing the way the Nazi soldiers had treated these Russian villagers had made me very uncomfortable and sensitive inside. It made me think, how could the other nations not see what is going on here? Why? Ugh. I honestly was so surprised that I sat there through the whole movie, I did feel like leaving the room it made me so emotional. Although, I was uncomfortable the film is very effective in touching each individuals emotions.",5,3,18,10 February 2012
