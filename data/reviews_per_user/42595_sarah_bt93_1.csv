Come and See," Disturbing at times but is a must-see. Powerful
","Come and See is a very powerful movie, it affected me deeply. The movie starts off simply with a young 12 year old boy wanting to join the battle against the Nazis. He was excited to be part of the movement, to be able to fight for his people, his face expressions were so unbelievably positive as he left his village. As soon as he reaches camp, reality strikes him. The first bomb is hit and Florya is left speechless, stunned, and the look in his eye changes. The movie then follows Florya as he travels back to his village only to find his people brutally murdered, only he is blind to that. That is when the most powerful scene in the movie occurred, being only 1.5 seconds long, it affected me deeply; the bodies of his family and the people in his village. However, Florya does not notice, he keeps moving and experiences so many traumatizing moments that leave him out of his mind. Another powerful scene was when Florya arrived to a village just as soon as the Nazis arrived to. We see the poor innocent children with their parents being put into a house and burned to the ground, loud screams were all that was shown. We see the Germans laughing around as if nothing was going on while the expression on Florya's face is so strong. Florya, even though being psychologically bruised still moves on to join the soldiers against the Nazis. He picks up his gun, with the strongest look in his eyes and shoots a picture of Hitler. He shoots and shoots while we see shots of Hitler's laugh backwards. Florya sees a shot and shoots. The point was for us to see the gradual change of Florya from an innocent 12 year old boy to an innerly scarred human being. The movie ends with the a change in time to the winter, with snow falling as a symbol of hope. The movie is so vivid and disturbing yet we are given hope in the end because the scene of snow meant the time period when the Nazis were taken down. Come and See shows us the reality of how war really is, that it has been going on since then and is still going on now. I have seen so many movies about World War II but never more powerful and expressive than this. It is a must see and will keep you hanging minute by minute.",9,1,1,4 June 2012
