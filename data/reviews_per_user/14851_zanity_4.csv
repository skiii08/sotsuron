Lucky Number Slevin," One for the 'short bus'
","Here we have a so-called thriller that tells us exactly what the conclusion will be in the first few minutes of the movie, and then painfully and tediously crawls to that conclusion as if some how we are supposed to be surprised.Worse, near the end, the director forces us to sit through the longest and most unnecessary explanation scene any movie of this genre has ever had. In words of one syllable, spoken loudly and slowly, the director provides a denouement longer than the combined length of all such scenes found in the complete collection of Scooby Doo cartoons. However, unlike the kids cartoon, 'Slevin' offers no intrigue or unexpected twists.Now, in the film 'Click', we know the very ending from early in the film as well, but that forms part of the purpose of the movie, because it is the journey that matters, and the lessons learnt by the 'hero' along the way. It is impossible to offer the same explanation for 'Slevin'.Instead, 'Slevin' offers sets that are pretty at first, but soon become tedious through absolute repetition. 'Slevin' offers dialogue that seems passable at first as a (very) poor man's attempt at 'clever', but soon becomes extremely tedious through very mechanical over use. Worse, unlike 'revenge' movies of the 70's that would often use very similar plots, the body of the movie contains no gratuitous thriller action. Watching paint dry would give you more of a thrill.To be honest, the beginning of the film convinced me that I was watching some kind of clever joke, with the transparent nature of the plot serving to set up the real story. I was left speechless by the end.Willis, Freeman and Kingsley are every bit as bad as one might expect in this kind of production. Hartnett and Liu are pleasing eye candy, but nothing else. The minor characters are VERY minor characters, though a couple, Missick and Williamson, come closest to some 'Tarantino'-style fun. Beyond the sets, the film is 'amateur hour' to the max.Will you like this movie? If 'Layer Cake' was a winner for you, go for it. If, on the other hand, 'Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang' floated your boat, stay well away. I rate this film 3 only because it was quite easy on the eye.",3,10,22,11 July 2006
Hostel," If you approve of real-life torture, you will love 'Hostel'
","I have just watched 'Hostel', and as a result, my mind is filled with a vast amount of anger and disgust at the content of this film. I am not the world's biggest horror fan, but will certainly watch 'mainstream' movies in this genre. 'The Devil's Rejects' wasn't to my taste (athough I loved its prequel), but the film had many praise worth qualities, and proved Rob Zombie to be a director worthy of much bigger and better projects. 'Saw' was great, 'Saw 2' hohum.'Hostel' however, doesn't even pretend to be a horror film. It is, instead, nothing more than a plea for the re-acceptance of the use of torture in the real world.The film is cheaply made, with useless acting, and a cheap nasty use of untouched abandoned industrial locations. However, it is in this that the film is TOTALLY honest, for the film is concerned ONLY with scenes of torture and sadism, devoid of any context or dramatic purpose. The film ONLY comes to life when a torture scene is showing. The rest of the time, 'Hostel' is like a very very inferior copy of a plot-free version of 'An American Werewolf in Paris'.In the opening scene of 'The Evil That Men Do', a low rent Charles Bronson thriller, we witness a bunch of would-be torturers receive a practical classroom lesson in the art of inflicting pain and humiliation on a real-life male and female victim. 'Hostel' was made as a pure piece of desensitisation for such an audience.I'm sure the renamed 'School of the Americas', the main facility in the US for training the leaders of death squads that operate in various Latin America nations, has already placed a giant order for DVD copies of 'Hostel' to use as a teaching aid.There is NO black humour in 'Hostel'. No dark subversive comment. No plot to speak of. No irony and no invention. No decent editing, and no decent cinematography. The East European landscape is cheaply and artlessly shot. The sexual nudity is tedious in the extreme. All these negatives allow the film-makers to purify the central purpose of their film, an act of pure worship at the temple dedicated to the worst of Human crimes, murder by torture.'Hostel' has but one message, that torture is now to be accepted as a normal part of the Human experience. When the use of torture by the West became commonplace in US facilities in Afghanistan, Iraq, Cuba, and many ex-Soviet-controlled nations (eg., US military bases in Poland and Romania), we had a choice. To howl our outrage, and return Western Civilisation back to the values previously in place for at least the last two hundred years. Or to quietly submit, and embrace the new age of depravity. The makers of 'Hostel' believe that we have voted for depravity, and wish to cheer that result as loudly as possible.As a side observation, why was the film giving Slovakia such a kicking? Is this rivalry between the successful Czech Republic, and the other part of the former nation of Czechoslovakia. Torture and racism, what a lovely combination.I can't score this movie for obvious reasons. However, if I could score for evil intent, 'Hostel', like John Wayne Gacy, would score a perfect 10.For those of you that would seek to misunderstand my position, I would explain that I am too squeamish to watch the whole of even the 'cut' version of Hellraiser 2, but I would NEVER dream of describing that film as evil. The often stupid and tasteless Italian exploitation horror movies of the 70's and 80's likewise always have some merit, and would never be described by myself as evil. For me, 'Hostel' is a first.",Null,2,4,20 March 2006
Dreamgirls," The 'whitest' movie ever to have a 'black' cast.
","Dreamgirls is a painful, spiteful, hateful parody of 'black' performers and music from the US in the 60's/70's. Do not be fooled into thinking that this film contains any real music from the period- it does not! The successful US musical theatre exists to please a middle-class white audience that takes pride in how strongly it despises the musical outlets that helped the commercial success of the various modern 'black' musical forms. Only when one of these forms has become so established that it can be seen as 'quaint' and 'harmless' will it be blandly repackaged for the amusement of this audience.Dreamgirls (the movie) is designed to be a commercial clunker, stuffed with household names to have maximum mainstream appeal. Danny Glover is, as one might expect, awful beyond belief. Foxx has a bland, and entirely unremarkable role. Murphy represents one of the worst acts of miscasting I have ever seen, and insults the memory of ever great 'black' male singer from the period, with his watered down 'Saturday Night Live' antics.The female actors get to play nothing but tedious third rate clichés. Three are simply required to look tall, slim and pretty, while the fourth, Hudson, gets to play the 'fat' lady who screeches loudly at various times during the movie, enabling the whitebread-targetted audience to imagine they are back at the opera. While all four are supposed to be playing 'sexy' singers, Condon couldn't get female sexuality on film save his life.There is no real story of substance. Sickeningly, the theme of 'black' musicians being locked out of the mainstream music biz is raised, when this film, Dreamworks produced, actually locks out any and all genuine 'black' music, while mocking it at the same time.The film clearly had obscene amounts of money available to create 'no expense spared' production values that substituted for any creative thinking. Indeed, Condon is never happier then when illustrating how much he was able to spend. The end result gives some fleeting shots of technical excellence, and a lot of useless, overly familiar, flashy editing clichés. The film has no heart, and never could have given the source material, so Condon attempts to distract from this with every visual gimmick he can think of.If you love music, genuine sexy performances, and directing that required the use of real imagination, and not merely a very fat wallet, go rent Idlewild, a musical film that doesn't just have a 'black' cast fronting for an all 'white' production, but actually has 'black' talent behind the camera, including director and authors of the musical numbers. Idlewild made my heart soar. Dreamgirls made me sick to the pit of my stomach.Of course, disgracefully Dreamgirls will be competing for 'oscars' whereas Idlewild won't even get a mention. All of you that claim to like Dreamgirls should think long and hard on this fact, for it speaks of a very unpleasant truth.",2,4,13,12 January 2007
Jarhead," When Mendes makes a recruitment film for the marines
","What would happen if someone made 'Starship Troopers' for real? Jarhead is the fascist recruiting tool that Verhoeven parodied so effective in his most commonly misunderstood work.Like ST, but with no sense of irony whatsoever, Jarhead is a lazy slop of marine clichés acted out by a bunch of pretty boys straight out of Beverly Hills 90210. The film is a crude cut'n'paste from every war film you've seen in the last 30 years, making no effort whatsoever to hide how much it steals in method from productions like 'Biloxi Blues'. Because the story as shot has no veracity of its own, its 'Gulf war' flavour is an artificial list of iconic standouts taken from articles appearing in US magazines and papers at the time, as with the clumsy and tedious scenes involving commercial airliners moving troops.The script and dialogue are simply awful. The performances, well they suit the recruiting purpose of the movie fine, in so far as they obviously 'speak' to young naive viewers, as so many reviews here prove.The film has one one merit, and that is the cinematography. However, even this is one note, fine for 15 mins, tedious and annoying across the whole movie.Taken as a whole, think MTV music video. Pretty people, pretty pictures, superficial, but with a hook crafted to 'catch' a generation.As the US prepares for an horrific war in Iran, this is the movie designed to condition a new generation of kids for their role as cannon fodder. Simple minded people could not get the point of Starship Troopers, because it seemed to show that 'war is hell'. Simple minded people do not get the point of Jarhead because it shows that 'war is tedium'. Neither seem designed to recruit people into the armed services. However, the way in which any propaganda works is in how the embedded message REALLY connects with the viewer, regardless of what the viewer thinks at the time.Jarhead was made for the self-same reason as Stealth. However, it is obvious that Jarhead does its propaganda job a thousand times better.For those of you that really want to know about the nature of marine snipers, may I invite you to use the internet to learn about the events in places like Fallujah. Ambulance drivers shot in the face, women gunned down as they left their besieged homes in search for water, and whole families sniped dead one at a time as they sought to escape from the city. There are 'interesting' stories to be told about US marines, but Sam Mendes is no more likely to film them than Leni Riefenstahl would have shown the true nature of Hitler's regime.",2,3,7,28 January 2006
