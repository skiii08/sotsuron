The Blair Witch Project," A great amatuer movie.
","'The Blair Witch Project' is a great movie only because it is shot with a home-video camera which makes it 'realistic' in my view.A very great film and so scary I would compare it with 'Psycho'. This film is one of the greatest horror movies ever made according to film critics,although I would not put the film in amongst the top 10 best horror films. Three young film students set off in the woods for a filming of a documentary about the so called 'Blair witch', they are stalked and one by one are killed in the horrible woods. A film which seems to haunt and scare the audience for a long time after the film should be watched by people who love horror. A 'must-see' for those who enjoy being scared out of their wits.",Null,0,1,7 April 2002
The Exorcist," A great tale of the supernatural
","'The Exorcist' is a good film.I wouldn't call it 'scary' though compared with the films we have today,but nevertheless it remains a good flick.Not much happens until the end of the film,but the story to the film is a very strange and good one.A girl called Regan is possessed by the devil as a result to playing with a Ouija board,and an exorcist is called in as a last resort to help the possessed girl and rid her of the demon from within.I first rented 'The Exorcist' out on VHS and couldn't see what all the fuss was about,but I did fairly enjoy the film towards the climax of it.You probably will not enjoy the film watching it in daylight so for atmosphere I recommend you watch this film at night with your lights turned right down alone in the dark for a much more exciting and enjoyable expierience.A great tale of the supernatural.",10,0,1,7 April 2002
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," The best Comedy film ever made!
","Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a film for people with a great sense of humour.Fans of the Comedy genre will not walk away after seeing the film unsatisfied.The film's opening credits will even have you laughing in stiches.The rabbit that is sweet enough to attack humans is a spectacular creation,the old man who can predict the nearby future is a funny add to the picture,the coconuts used for the sound of riding horses is very amusing and the Knights of Ni are the most wild people in the movie, I would recommend it to anyone who is wanting a laugh for ages.The film was shot with a superb camera and for a film of the 1970s it is very spectacular.King Arthur is the king of the Britons who is told by God himself that he and his team must go on a quest for the search of the Holy Grail.This film is the best british comedy.Infact, this film in my opinion is one of the, if not THE best film that I have ever viewed.I would highly recommend it to people who love a great laugh.",10,0,0,6 April 2002
