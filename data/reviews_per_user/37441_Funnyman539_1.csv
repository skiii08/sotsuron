Scarface," Scarface was an alright flick
","Scarface just didn't bring enough to the table I gave it a 7 because it did have some awesome scenes. Otherwise it was a total cliché. Some of this movie was a yawn, some was edge-of-your-seat-good, yet it definitely wasn't goodfellas good. It would have been much better if they had made this movie about two hours instead of its boring as hell long run time. Some of these scenes were absolutely dreadful because they were so cliché. The Chainsaw scene was definitely not one of these scenes. I agree with the few people who say that people like movie just because other people like that particular movie. See you all later!
