Sucker Punch," Great movie, tons of action, beautiful effects
","I went to see this after seeing a preview and wondering what the heck was going on. First and foremost, the movie is a little weird. Perhaps that's what attracted me to it, because that's really all I got out of the trailer. Anyway, not knowing what to expect, I was very happy with the $7 I paid to see this film. The action was pervasive and intense, the effects were gorgeous, and on the rare occasion that the action died down a bit, the story was intriguing enough to keep me satisfied the whole way through. The acting, I thought, was very good from most of the characters and the plot had twists and turns that you won't see coming. Definitely worth seeing.",9,4,9,4 April 2011
