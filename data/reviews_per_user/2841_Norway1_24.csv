The Incredible Hulk," MUCH better than I even hoped!
","After watching the first couple of trailers for this I was very unimpressed and even began to doubt (big time) that this would be any good. Thank goodness I was SO wrong!Let me start by admitting I actually liked HULK (2003) aside from Nick Nolte and the last 10 minutes or so. Sure, it was a little short on action and heavy on drama, but I thought the effects were awesome and the acting very good.This Hulk blows that one completely away! It is so much better I couldn't even believe it! Maybe the reason I liked it so much was because of my very low expectations but this movie delivered in every way a comic-book movie should!Before watching I read the first 15 or so comments here on IMDb to see how people were reacting. Most of them positive, there were still a handful of negative reviews that had me questioning. However after seeing the film I must wonder what those people expected. I just can't imagine it being any better! Seriously. It freaking rocked!Marvel, I can't wait for more!If you want to compare your tastes with mine, here's my opinion of some other comic book films (rating out of 10)... Spider-man: 8 ::: Spidey 2: 9 ::: Spidey 3: 5 ::: X-Men: 7 ::: X2: 8 ::: X3: 7 ::: Superman Returns: 4 ::: Batman Begins: 9 ::: Iron Man: 9 ::: Hulk (2003): 6 ::: The Incredible Hulk: 8",7,4,7,16 June 2008
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Why critics are wrong (SPOILERS)
","WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS.After waiting for nearly three months after it's release in the States I was finally able to see The Phantom Menace on Opening night at the world's largest (and best!) THX certified theater. IÂ‘ll preface my comments with the following background:1. I am a huge fan of the original trilogy, though I haven't submerged myself into any secondary entertainment (novels, comics, roll-playing games, etc.). My knowledge of Lucas' creation is based purely on the films themselves.2. To find out about it I purchased the novelization by Terry Brooks (admittingly a first for me), and read the screenplay. So I knew the story and it's characters pretty thoroughly before my first viewing.3. At 29 I am still pretty much a kid at heart and have three young ones of my own. 4. I am extremely open minded and my movie tastes vary from sappy melo-drama's to complex thrillers to Shakespear. I look for the overall quality in movies, not surface-value.With this said I submit my 'educated' opinion of TPM: It's 'style' or 'feeling' is (IMHO) totally in harmony with the others. There may be some new ideas here to swallow (Anakin's conception, the midi-chlorians in general, etc.) and one could arguably question the consistency of the story, but to say that the original three were made for adults while this one was aimed for audiences of children is (again IMHO) completely unjustified.Remember this about 'Jedi': 1. Hokey lines, such as Han's: 'What? Luke's a Jedi Knight? He can't hardly take care of himself, let alone...' and threepio's: 'Look Artoo... and Han's still frozen in carbonite!' and TONS of infantile others. 2. The revelation that Leia was Luke's sister (How much more soap-opera-ish can you get?). 3. The Muppet-family-world of creatures around the rancor pit in Jabba's palace. (Too much!) 4. Boba Fett's lame demise.5. The incredibly poorly choreographed final light-saber battle, Vader's sudden change of heart and the Emperor's death.Still, I consider ROTJ to be a worthy end to the story.Jar Jar Binks was NOT as annoying as everyone made him out to be. I was pleasantly surprised. I admit he could have had a tad less screen time, but he was pretty funny (most of the time) and I actually liked him. I think his purpose in the story was mostly to show Qui-Gon's obsession for helping the less fortunate. Darth Maul was perfect. People say he had too few speaking parts and too little screen time. I disagree. He fulfilled his purpose. Boba Fett was also rad, but you didn't see Lucas feeding on this and squeezing him into every imaginable scene. He used him when it was appropriate. Maul's death was necessary for us to understand Palpatine's future frustration in trying to replace him (and forthcoming Sith apprentices).Dull characters? Remember Luke in ROTJ? I rest my case. Jedi are trained to not show their emotions. Royalty are just the same. On the other hand the pod-racer announcer was anything but dull.Weak story line? Again, I refer to ROTJ. A 'new' Death Star - ooooh! Original, huh? No character development? Again it appears everyone has forgotten the original three. Was Han Solo's character developed AT ALL in ANH? Anything-for-money was all we knew about him. Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru? Nope. Vader? Just a mystical dude in black that liked to choke people with the force. Obviously I would strongly disagree with this point. As with the original trilogy, Lucas will use the next two instalments for better developing the characters.Here's what I loved the most: 1. The Jedi council. This is a nice way to introduce to us what the Jedi were before being eliminated by the Sith. 2. The Force. Watching the Jedi (and Maul) leap through the air feigning weightlessness. Their speed in escaping the Destroyers on the Federation control ship - Awesome!3. The perfect world. As this was before the Empire took over and destroyed everything it was nice to see the immaculate beauty of their peaceful existence.4. The special effects (of course). The beauty of the underwater scenes, all the backgrounds in their entirety, and the CGI characters. AMAZING!5. The costumes. The Queen's wardrobe. Basically everyone's from Boss Nass to Senator Palpatine to Captain Panaka. Impressive to the last drop!!6. The sound. Intense and loud! Perfect!7. The editing. The seamless scene shifts were fantastic. Especially in the final battle scenes. 8. The acting. Everyone did an exceptional job portraying their respective roles. My favorites were Portman, August, McDiarmid, Neeson and Hugh Quarshie (Panaka). Ahmed Best and Brian Blessed were excellent as well. Lloyd did well, but could have had a little more enthusiasm in his 'Yippi's.
I am certain there will be Oscar nominations (if not the award itself) given to points 4-7, and perhaps (however unlikely) to a couple actors.
Of course there were small things I didn't like as well:
1. Annie's friends (Kitster excepted): Wald & the group of heckler-kids. Too much!2. The music was pretty bland aside from the last 10 minutes (Duel of the fates and the final celebration song). Not enough like the original trilogy (IMHO). 3. The space battle at the end didn't have enough close-up shots like ANH and Jedi - the ones where you're looking through someone's cockpit at other ships swarming at you, getting blown away while others crash into larger ships, etc. 4. The Hero-making of Anakin at the end. I think that's about it. I loved the rest and want more of the same.My recommendation to all you nay-sayers is this: Take a closer look at the original trilogy before (mis-) judging this fine beginning to the saga.I could say much more, but I've reached the 1000 word limit.Overall a solid 9 out of 10. Better than Jedi. Not quite up there with ANH or Empire.",7,0,0,2 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Why the critics are wrong
","Warning: May contain spoilers!After waiting in anxiety for nearly three months after it's release in the States I was finally able to see The Phantom Menace on Oslo's opening night (day) at the world's largest (and best!)

I am a huge fan of the original trilogy, though I haven't submerged myself into any secondary entertainment such as novels, comics, roll-playing games, etc. My knowledge of Lucas' creation is based purely on the films themselves.2. I couldn't wait for the movie to be released in Norway to find out what it contained, so I purchased the novelization by Terry Brooks (something I haven't done with the previous instalments), and read the screenplay. So I guess you could say I knew the story and it's characters pretty thoroughly.3. My taste in movies is vast and covers nearly all types of films, Yet I consider myself picky to details.Now for my 'educated' opinion of TPM:It's 'style' or 'feeling' is (IMHO) totally in harmony with the others. There may be some new ideas here to swallow (Anakin's conception, the midi-chlorians in general, etc.) and one could arguably question the consistency of the story, but to say that the original three were made for adults while this one was aimed for audiences of children is (again IMHO) completely unjustified.

Boba Fett's lame demise.5. The incredibly poorly choreographed final light-sabre battle where Luke cut's off Vader's hand.6. And finally the overly simple turning of Vader back to the 'light' side - too easy I think (including Palpatine's death).Still, I consider Jedi to be an adequate one of my all-time favorite movies simply because of the love I have for the characters in the Star Wars universe (and those jammin' speeder bikes)!Jar Jar Binks was NOT as annoying as everyone made him out to be.

This is a nice way to introduce to us what the Jedi were before being eliminated by the Sith.2. The Force. Watching Obi-Wan & Qui-Gon race through the halls of the Federation's control ship like speeding bullets was nifty, to say the least. Obi-Wan using the force to empower himself to 'fly' out of the energy shaft in the final battle and all the other times they leap through the air feigning weightlessness and defying gravity.

Fight Club," Finchers' best
","This movie just grows on me more and more. I liked it when I first saw it in cinema, but after my second viewing I liked it even more. Now, after having seen it on DVD two more times, I have grown to absolutely love it!It is now one of my favorite films. I just changed my rating from 8 (my original rating after 2 viewings in the cinema) to 10.An absolutely brilliant film with outstanding performances from all 3 of the main cast. Edward Norton shines specifically brightly.",10,0,1,11 July 2003
Iron Man 2," Very good, but sadly not as good as Iron Man 1
","I'm really torn between a rating of 7 and 8 and should probably see it again before a final verdict. But my initial feeling is this one had too much talk and too little heart.While there certainly was more action, the action scenes - especially the last - did not feel threatening at all. The one possible exception to this is the first battle between Iron Man and Whiplash - the one on the race track from the trailer.The main problem is probably too much dialog, possibly too much happening, and too little heart. Too few quiet moments. I'm not sure.My guess is the film makers heard that people loved the humor from the first (which was mostly ad-libbed from the actors) but missed more action. So they apparently gave the whole cast (of GREAT actors all around!) free reign to talk up as much as they want in each and every scene. And they added action sequence after action sequence to make up for the mere two major sequences from Iron Man 1.The end result was slightly underwhelming, yet almost satisfying.",7,22,46,30 April 2010
The 13th Warrior," Well-worth-the-ride cleaver and unique action-thriller.
","I Finally got to watch this movie as it was just released to video here in Norway. Either I missed it somehow when it was in the theaters it never was released to theaters here. What can I say more than that I LOVED IT!! I thoroughly enjoyed nearly every detail. Without spoiling it for those that haven't seen it yet here's a summary followed by my review and take on it:This is the story of an Arabian diplomat played by Antonio Banderas and his adventure in the land assigned for him to diplomat: 'The North'. Today this would be called Northern Europe, Scandinavia or even more specifically: Norway. ;o)He takes with him his trusted advisor and interpreter, Melkisedek (sp?) to try to communicate with the Norse leaders and assess the situation of their country. In doing so he meets up with a group of Norsemen (Vikings) during a celebration for the coronation of their new king and funeral of their late king.During his stay with these Vikings a young boy from one of the villages of northern Norway comes to seek their help. Several of the neighboring villages had been destroyed by mysterious creatures and king of this boy's village sent him to find some warriors to assist them in defending themselves against these creatures.A fortune teller is summoned to advise them to how they may defeat  the creatures. She says 13 men must travel to the village, the 13th not being a Norseman. Antonio is obviously chosen to be the 13th warrior and they set off together for the quest.It isn't as gory and full of violence as one might expect. I for one was pleasantly surprised by it's tactful balance. They showed enough for you to get the idea that the creatures were cannibals and to sort of frighten you, but they didn't over do it and make it into a 'hack and slash' horror flick.It was an intelligent thriller that required some thinking. I wondered, 'How in the world are they going to defeat these guys?' and was mostly satisfied by the answer (which I won't give away now anyway).As one who can objectionably critique this film's accuracy to true Norse lifestyle and legend I must say they did a pretty darn good job!The language spoken by the Vikings was mostly Norwegian. While one of the 12 spoke it with a Danish accent and at least 5 or 6 others had quite strong American accents it was still mostly accurate. The only problem with this is that the true language of the Norsemen/Vikings wasn't really Norwegian as we know and speak it today. It was a very Old Norwegian much more similar (I assume) to Danish while yet very different from both languages. However, giving credit they probably could not have made an accurate imitation of it and if they did it would have been so unintelligible that we couldn't have understood it nor could they have found actors to accurately portray it.The costume detail was terrific! I loved the armor and weaponry used by the Vikings. Their ships were also quite realistic and true to history. One thing I really appreciated was the strange rituals and superstitions of the Vikings. The way they 'buried' the Viking's leader in the beginning by sending him out in his ship along with his armor and sword and burned it (the ship) is 100% true to legends. In addition they sent a young maiden (likely a virgin) along with him for this 'journey to paradise' which is also Norse folklore. Also many of their sayings and habits were typical of this culture - especially for back then. Basically I was very impressed with the consistency. What some people may call a lack of plot I call a cleaver and unique story with a historical background without the need for an excessive abundance of plot twists and Hollywood fluff. To my benefit I haven't the incredible book to taint my judgement. There are most certainly many differences and some may be disappointed (they always are) with the result, but frankly I can't see why they complain. This is the MOVIE VERSION!! Get over it!I highly recommend it for anyone that enjoys a good action-thriller with a twist of historical nature. It's almost a combination of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and BRAVEHEART.Long live the VIKINGS!!",7,0,0,21 February 2000
Spider-Man 3," BEST effects, yet WORST movie
","I enjoyed Spider-Man 3 quite a lot. However, there were so many problems with it that I ended up only 'liking' it instead of loving it like the first two films.Let me get to the pros vs the cons:THE GOODThe Effects: Birth of Sandman is the coolest effect on any film I can remember. Amazing! The fight scenes were also incredibly well realized. The Humor: J.Jonah.Jameson had some hilarious moments - especially his first scene. Bruce Campbell plays a waiter (Maitre D really) in a French restaurant, and it is probably the best scene in the whole movie! Peter dancing! The Action: The first Sandman vs Spidey scene was very exciting. Maybe the best battle sequence from all three films. CGI-Venom looked great in the whole four-minutes of screen time he got. All the fight-scenes were EXCELLENT, well choreographed and exciting.The Acting: James Franco has improved much as Harry. Gwen Stacey was much better used than I expected. (And she was beautiful!) Thomas Haden Church was perfect for Sandman! Topher Grace did a fine job as Brock, not so great as Venom.I guess that is a good intro for...THE BADVenom has WAY too little screen time. His story was too rushed. Sandman is made to look like a good guy, then bad, and at some points we're not sure what to think. Do we feel sorry for him? Fear him? The filmmakers couldn't decide, and it shows. The Costumes: Harry's mask was just ridiculous! Seeing Brock's face in the Venom suit looked stupid. And the Dark Spidey suit wasn't 'alive' enough. It just looked like a suit, not a living organism. The Score (music): Some parts were OK but some parts were SO bad it ruined the scene! An example is the over-scoring of the first Dark-Spidey scene (where he's hanging upside down looking at himself in a building window). It was painfully bad, screaming out for the audience to be amazed. Like holding up an applause sign. Tacky. Then there were plenty of similar moments, mostly in other action scenes. American Cheese: Spidey landing in front of a HUGE, randomly placed, waving American flag. The camera panning back from a crying MJ and Peter atop a huge building, to make sure we see a sunset in the background, etc. Manipulative tripe. The evil-dudes team-up in the end was very contrived. I didn't buy it. How Spidey deals with Sandman in the end was also quite silly. Not cool at all.The biggest problem is trying to squeeze too much into one film. Spider-Man 3 should have been about Sandman and Harry/Goblin. Venom should have been held back for the next one. The fourth film could have been all about Venom, giving him more screen time and the treatment he deserves.I know this was Sam Raimi's original plan (not to include Venom in this film) but Avi Arad convinced him to add Venom into the story, for the fans, since everybody loves Venom.Too bad Sam didn't follow his plan. I doubt he'll come back for more now. Let's just hope he gets to make The Hobbit (unless by some miracle Peter Jackson gets to do it after all).Thanks for reading! :)",6,526,768,7 May 2007
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," anti-climactic, yet a good finish.
","Though disputably inferior to episodes iv and v 'Jedi' makes for a fantastic finish to the trilogy and sends chills down your spine. It is, unfortunately, rather predictable from about half-way through, and I must say it was almost disappointing to see Vader's conclusion. Though cute and cuddly those ewoks just don't add believability nor remain in consistency with the tone set from episode iv. (They do however add appeal to females thus broadening the viewer spectrum.) What more can be said than that the action, special effects and general story can nor has been equalled by any sci-fi film in history. Lucas is sure to go down in history as one of the greatest sci-fi/fantasy writer of all time.",7,0,1,26 September 1998
Léon: The Professional," Quite probably Besson's best!
","I finally tracked down this movie after searching several local video stores, and boy, was it worth the search!I absolutely loved this film!I finally see what gave Natalie Portman all her acclaim as an actress. She was so terrific in this! I was astounded by her ability - especially the scene where she walks down the hall past her apartment door to discover her family was murdered with the Perpetrators still inside. She keeps walking, trying not to show any emotion to give away the fact that she lives there as there's a man standing outside sort of 'guarding' the place. She goes to her neighbor's door and starts knocking. Tears are streaming down her cheeks and she has a look of horror and desperation on her face as she whispers, 'Open the door, please. Please open the door!' over and over. I almost started crying for her. She is truly a fantastic actress. And to think she did this at the age of 12-13! The whole movie was just packed full of incredible scenes such as this. Another scene that made my heart melt was the scene where she tries to explain to Léon  how she knows that she's in love with him: 'I have this warm feeling in my stomach. There was a knot there before but now it's gone.' And the scene where she dresses up as Madonna, Marilyn Monroe, Charlie Chaplin and Gene Kelly. She was so adorable singing and acting. 'a mustache.' she says trying to look serious and melancholy like Chaplin.Reno was very good as well. I never really thought too much of him before (neither liked him nor disliked him). This movie shows that he really has a great talent.What probably amazed me the most about this was that Luc Besson both wrote it and directed it. Very well done. I hope he makes more like this one! While I liked Jean de Arc and the 5th Element I wouldn't put them in the same class as this one.I give it 10 out of 10. On a bad day I might go down to 9½. ;o)",9,0,1,24 September 2000
Watchmen," Can barely be called a movie at all
","More aptly, 'An Experience' (as a friend pointed out during the end credits)...Opening Night with 3 friends: One knew NOTHING of the film or book (had seen the trailer, that's all) and expected this to be like X-Men (boy was he in for a shock!), one was an old-school fan, like myself, and one (his girlfriend) was newly introduced to the book and had read it a few weeks before the film's release.I was mostly worried about how my uninitiated friend (who was expecting the X-Men) would react. I was nervous throughout the film - especially during the more wordy scenes - that he would not like it or not understand it. This guy is a Truck Driver. Mostly into horror movies like the new Halloween and Devil's Rejects and he liked 300. So he really digs hardcore violence, action and gore and isn't usually so big on story. However, one of his favorite movies is No Country For Old Men, so I knew there was hope! :)Well, he says he loved it! He realized about 10 minutes in that this was not going to be anything like he expected. He changed viewing modes from 'sit back and enjoy the popcorn' to 'pay attention, this is deep and important.' My other two friends loved it too. The girlfriend is the one who said, 'This is one of those few movies where you want to walk out, buy another ticket, and go right back in to watch it again.' And 'This is hardly like a movie and more of An Experience'.She's right. Absolutely. But I'm not sure I embrace it whole heartedly. Part of me thinks it would have been better if it was in fact more like a movie and less like a graphic-novel put to screen.For one, there was far too much dialog and not enough emotion or 'acting'. While Rorschach, Manhattan and Dan/Night Owl were great, Laurie and Veidt were hardly watchable. Really!Laurie was played as a shallow, naive, sex-dependent, childish brat. Granted, she was never that exciting in the book but I would have preferred a more interesting character than a shallow facsimile of the graphic novel.Veidt played as a monotone, emotionless, brainiac villain. He never seemed convinced of his own convictions and always appeared to be bored out of his mind.The scenes with Dr. Manhattan (especially on Mars) were far too stuffed of dialog. The movie could have been cut down 20 minutes if more time was spent showing emotion and less on exposition and pointless dialog. Did we really need to hear philosophical exposition on quantum mechanics and physics? While it might have worked in the book (I had to force myself NOT to skip over it to get to 'the good stuff') it could have been avoided in the film, replaced with music and the flashbacks. Did we need more?One very minor gripe is the need to call the group 'Watchmen'. I was hoping that Dan's line in the trailer was the only time we would hear it, but I counted 5 times, spoken by Dan, Rorschach and Veidt. So it's not just a subtle line thrown in but a part of the story. No more 'Crime Busters' (which was intended to sound silly).And then there's the 'old' makeup. Unforgivably bad. Gawd Awful! Just plain amateurish. Seriously, how they could get so much right on the visual side, but completely drop the ball on makeup is beyond me. And since I'm not alone in spotting it (Garth Franklin, etc) it's more than just a minor annoyance.My final complaint would be the overly exaggerated action scenes - particularly during the finale at Antarctica. These guys are SUPPOSED to be normal humans. NOT real superheros. That's part of the point and it's completely lost during the last battle sequence. People are thrown 10 feet in the air, smashing pieces of concrete without pause. It really just looked ridiculous. Like one of the old Batman movies or worse the Batman TV show. All we lacked was the 'Wham!' and 'Pow!' blurbs.One complaint I have heard which I can NOT AGREE with is that the music was terribly bad. That the songs almost never matched the scenes. This is so completely wrong that I wonder why one would even suggest it. To me everything worked so well I was absolutely stunned. I was skeptical about the music going in but agreed with every single piece I heard. All the songs worked perfectly with their scenes, from Simon and Garfunkel to Jimmy Hendrix to Philip Glass. Absolute, pure Genius!So why do I rate the film 7/10 with so many complaints? Really, I did like the film and could write more good about it than bad. But so many other reviewers have done that and better than I could. I agree with much of what has been said. The main point in its favor is what my friend said when we walked out. It's unlike ANY movie I have ever seen before. It's more of an 'experience' - one that should be repeated as many times as possible in the ideal format of the Big Screen. Preferably, I presume, on Imax (we don't have one in Norway).EDIT: After a couple weeks I have increased my rating to 8/10. It really grows on me over time. It may even go up more but for now I think 8 is the right score.",8,1,5,10 March 2009
The Matrix Revolutions," Absolutely Brilliant!
","With all the bad reviews of this film I expected it to really stink!My worst fear was the it wouldn't answer all the questions it set up in Reloaded.Thank goodness I was completely wrong!In the first act, Neo visits the Oracle and asks her why he could stop the Sentinals at the end of Reloaded. She answers him in a very plain and simple fashion that only a fool wouldn't understand.Nearly all the other questions are answered as well, if perhaps sometimes in a more subtle manner.The brothers set up the trilogy in the very first episode to have Neo play the role of the Savior, and they follow through all the way - pulling no stops!It was executed brilliantly! I couldn't ask for a better finish!After another viewing, I'm certain ALL my questions would be answered and I would give it 10 out of 10. As is, I still am a tad uncertain about 1 minor detail: Who was the 'Mother of the Matrix' that the Architect mentions in Reloaded?I am pretty sure it was the woman who shared the last scene with the Architect, but would need another viewing to be certain.After first viewing, my score is a very strong 9 out of 10.",7,0,0,5 November 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," A perfect ending to the story
","I understand that some people expected something a lot 'deeper' and think they could have come up with a much more clever story than what we were given in this last chapter of the Matrix trilogy.However, in reality, it answers all the important questions and gives us absolute visual brilliance - probably the BEST I have ever seen (including Return of the King which I viewed just yesterday).After my first viewing of Revolutions, I was so satisfied I gave it a 9 out of 10. In fact, almost a perfect 10.However, when I watched it again a second time, I saw some of the flaws and had to lower my score to 8 out of 10.The flaws I noticed are small, but important. It was dialogue here and there that seemed very second-rate compared to what we're fed in the first Matrix. It was the deliverance of some of the lines. And it was in the performance of one of the key characters: The Oracle.SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUTMy biggest gripe with the lines is in the rediculous scene between Neo and Trinity after they crash-land their ship in the Machine City. Trinity is about to die and they have this very 'emotional' moment.The acting in this scene is really quite bad - especially from Reeves. They are alone on the ship. Not a soul for MILES. And yet they WHISPER their entire dialogue!?!? Why? This scene was also very unnecessarily drawn out - much like the 'disco rave' scene on Zion in Reloaded - except not as cool.The story, however, is completed very well. The questions I had after Reloaded were all answered by the film's end.Also, the sound and visual effects are absolutely stunning! Without a doubt in my mind the best visual feast of any movie ever! Especially the machine city, and Zion's final battle with the sentinals!Smith's fate ties brilliantly in with Neo. Their final battle is brilliantly choreographed and visual brilliance!That said, I do feel the last two-thirds of this trilogy (Reloaded and Revolutions) should have been compact into one film. There was simply too much unnecessary fluff.But, as I said in my summary: I think the STORY itself was absolutely sound, solid, and simply perfect.",7,0,0,18 December 2003
American History X," One of the extremely few moral installments in recent Hollywood history.
","This was a movie receiving much controversy here in Europe and possibly in the US as well.I watched it mainly because I love Edward Norton as an actor - especially in Primal Fear! - and knew he would be exceptional in his role, though I knew very little about the story's plot.Edward Furlong is an incredible aspiring young actor (born in August, 1977 - he was 20 while filming this yet appears to be much younger, I think).I must say I was impressed beyond words by this films boldness and ability to stand forth with it's message.What is it's message?It teaches us that things aren't always what we're brought up to believe - Not always to believe the hype and circumstance that the paraphernalia around us so vividly offers. That we can make a difference in this world. That we are in complete control of our lives and can change the direction our life is going if we have the guts and tenacity.Mainly, I guess, I loved that Derek Vinyard saw the errors in his (and his brother Danny's) direction and was responsible enough to do something to change it. That he cared enough for his brother to lovingly help him to completely change the way he thought and, as a roll-model in Danny's life, to show him the example necessary to turn him around.I usually don't like movies with excessive violence and especially foul language, but in this case I think they were both necessary to show the extremely hateful world the white-supremests live in. I think it made it's point well. (Just be sure not to allow younger children near the screen while watching this. It definitely deserves it's 18+ (R) rating.)Though not without flaws I believe this movie to be one of the greater moral additions to Hollywood's disturbingly bland and irresponsible canon.",9,0,0,24 August 1999
X-Men: The Last Stand," Definitely the best of the three!
","I didn't think it could be done but Brett Ratner has made X3 even better than X2 - which says a lot! (I gave X2 9/10)The characters are more like we remember from the comics. Storm flies and messes with the weather a lot more. Wolverine goes Berzerk three times and gets thrown by Colossus twice. There is a Danger Room sequence. We have a lot more mutants. etc. etc etc.At the same time, while it was not a problem for me at all, I can see how perhaps some fans might dislike certain aspects. For example: Storm does have a lot of 'street talk' rather than her African Goddess style from the comics. Wolverine is very much a part of the team and even acts a bit in a teacher or team leader role at times. Angel and Cyclops are hardly in it. But all of these choices were for the better of the film in my opinion.Some of what made this film really great: 1) Phoenix is incredible! Amazing! Perfect! Absolutely brilliant! And fortunately the whole story really revolves around her, so she gets plenty of screen time. 2) Beast is spot on how most fans will remember him from the comics. 3) The mutants in general are more like the ones from the comics. 4) Juggernaught is cool! I never really liked him from the comics but Vinnie Jones really made the character. 5) Angel's story was very well told in a concise way. 6) Iceman finally gets to be Iceman.There are lots of new mutants and the three or four that we get to know a bit are well fleshed out considering the amount if screen time they get. Plus they have cool powers! The whole Brotherhood (Magneto's team) is very cool!But the thing that makes this film truly great and the best of the series is the story! And we are treated to some astonishing surprises! You will never ever guess to the fate of some of the main characters. Some die, some lose their powers. And believe me it will surprise you.There is so much left in the X-Men series that can be told. This movie alone opens about three possible future story lines.I hope that there will be more X-Men movies, and I hope Brett stays on as director.If you liked the first two you will LOVE this! :)10/10",9,11,23,24 May 2006
Transformers," Toy commercial with a HUGE budget, still loads of fun!
","Whoever says this is 'not a kids movie' is fooling them self.I really liked it. I enjoyed it emensely. But it is so clearly just a toy commercial with a HUGE budget.Shia steals the show as far as the actors go. I laughed my head off at some of his lines. He did a great job delivering some cheesy dialog and he has a natural talent that sells the story.Aside from him, it's the toys that steal the show! Those GIANT ROBOTS are AWESOME!!! This movie had more action than all of the other summer films this year combined! (The only exception may be Die Hard 4, which I haven't seen yet.)I was one of those kids who purchased the very first Transformer toys back when Optimus Prime was a gun, and one of the characters was a cassette player. So my affection for the Transformers franchise goes way back.Without making this very long, suffice to say that it is well worth your money as long as you can appreciate that it is a Michael (explosions) Bay movie, full of cheese dialog, a ridiculous story, and its main purpose is to sell toys.Heck, I bought four Transformers after watching this. (For my sons, of course.)BRING ON THE SEQUEL!",7,1,2,7 July 2007
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Incredibly disappointing!
","I am a huge fan of the books. I own a popular fansite, snitchseeker.com, just so you know I'm more than an average fan.At the same time, I have enjoyed the other movies, in spite of the many changes from the books.Admittedly, I have been skeptical about this film since the announcement of the director, David Yates.However, when two from my site's news team got early peeks of the film, they both had overwhelmingly positive reviews! (One slightly more positive than the other, but still!) If you want to read their positive reviews, go to snitchseeker.com and click the reviews links (one contains spoilers, one does not).So I decided I would watch the film, completely unbiased - even excited about it!** SPOILERS START HERE **It starts out very well: Harry sitting on a swing in a small park, watching some kids playing, the kids and mums leave, Dudley and gang enter, Dudley teases Harry about crying for Cedric in his sleep, Harry gets mad and threatens Dudley with wand, the sky clouds up real quick, Dudley's gang flee the scene, rain begins to pour, Harry and Dudley run under an overpass for shelter, Dementors attack.This is where it goes downhill.I wonder if Yates has even read the book. He says he has, but maybe he only skimmed through it quickly. He certainly missed the details and nuances other directors have picked up.Mrs. Figg was not in the slightest annoyed or frightened about the attack. She was casual, nonchalant, not really caring about Harry at all.The Advanced Guard scene was hacked to bits with only the bare necessities remaining - and without Lupin. I swear, the entire affair is about 30 seconds long.In the movie, the guard consisted of Tonks, Moody, Shacklebolt and a silent Elphias Doge. (Nice to see him!) However, it left out the other witches: Hestia Jones and Emmeline Vance. And no Lupin! Fine, I can live with that. But they arrive in Harry's bedroom, they don't explain anything, only say he is to come with them, and then it shows them lined up outside the house with their brooms and they take off! That's the whole scene!On the positive side, they made the flight more interesting by soaring them through London rather than high up in the clouds.The arrival at Grimmauld Place was done well enough. I liked seeing the houses magically stretch to make room for number 12. But the house was a MAJOR disappointment: No Mrs Black, no house-elf-heads on the walls, no disinfecting, no Buckbeak, no murderous ghouls, and hardly any Kreacher. While Lupin was present here, he had only one or two lines and Tonks had even less. Sirius Black gets all the dialog here.On the positive side, the 'extendable ears' and the twins apparating were cool and Mrs. Weasley was terrific. It was also nice to see Tonks changing her face a bit to resemble a pig and then a duck, with Ginny laughing at her.After about three minutes of 'The Order' we are whisked off on a speedy journey to the Ministry for Harry's trial. This was another major disappointment as it wasn't explained to the audience exactly what they were doing nor why they were traveling as muggles. I missed a line from Arthur along the lines of, 'Harry, we must travel as muggles this morning, using no magic because we want to give a good impression before your trial.' Instead we get a 5-second glimpse of their trip (a subway station and a sidewalk) and then the phone booth.Perhaps the most disappointing of the whole film was the lackluster design of the Ministry of Magic. Supposedly a Governmental establishment and yet ALL of the walls and floors of this place are simply BLACK! It's just ridiculous! Not only that but it looks so small compared to how it read in the books. Supposedly 10 levels, my house looks bigger than this place.Department of Mysteries? They only show the Hall of Prophesies and the Death Chamber (the room with the infamous veil). No exciting ROTATING ROOM (which you'd think would be a major part of this since it's even pictured on the cover of the US edition of the book!), no Time Room, Planet Room or Brain Room. Very, very sad.I just realized this review is turning into an essay, and that's not the point here at IMDb. So let me finish off.Here is the order in which I place the films (best to worst):Goblet of Fire (9) :: Prisoner of Azkaban (more Marauders would have placed this on top) (8) :: Chamber of Secrets (7) :: Philosopher's Stone (better CGI would place this one higher) (7) :: Order of the Phoenix (6)I fear for the end result of my second-favorite book so far: Half-Blood Prince. It's a shame Yates will be directing that one too. Let's hope the franchise ends with a bang by allowing another director in for Deathly Hallows.Thanks for reading! :)",5,6,10,20 July 2007
Titanic," Beauty with the standard Hollywood flaws:
","This was a brilliantly filmed movie and deserved many of its awards. I was however disappointed by two or three scenes, specifically (1) the ridiculous spitting lessons, (2) the portrait scene, (3) and especially the sex-in-the-car scene. It's sad that so many of Hollywood's producers feel the need to force totally unnecessary scenes such as these (not to mention Rose's 'finger' scene) into a movie just to try to 'appease' the public with the sex and worldly innuendos they think we want to see - regardless of whether it distracts us completely from the story at hand.With that said I must add that overall I really enjoyed the film as a whole. It's pluses easily outweigh the minuses.The most notable points I appreciated were (1) the fabulous score! (2) the amazing special effects, (3) the beautiful costumes, (4) the editing, (5) the lighting and colors in general, and finally (6) the casting for the main roles: Leonardo has got incredible charisma, Winslet is just a fantastic actress (loved her in Hamlet) and Billy Zane is always cool!I give it 8Â½ out of 10.",8,0,1,24 June 1999
Thor," EPIC! Every bit as good as Iron Man
","Although an avid Marvel comics reader I never once read Thor comic book. I was hooked on X-Men, Avengers, Spider-Man, Alpha Flight and others, but for some reason Thor never interested me much. So when this movie was announced I wasn't all too interested. The trailers weren't much help, though they perked my interest. A few good television spots and the final trailer convinced me to give it a try. So yesterday I took my 3 teenage kids to see it on opening night here in Oslo, Norway at (allegedly) the biggest screen in Europe.I was effing blown away! Maybe because I wasn't expecting much. Or maybe because it was a great film. I like to think it was great.Remove your biases and (even if you didn't like the trailers) if you loved the first Iron Man movie you will LOVE this!Personally, I didn't much like Iron Man 2, didn't like either of the Fantastic Four movies but loved Iron Man 1 and all the X-Men, Spider-Man and (Nolan) Batman movies. (Just for your comparison with taste.)Only word of caution/advice is to see it in 2D if possible. We watched it in 3D and though the 3D was pretty good (comparable with Green Hornet if you've seen that) it made several of the scenes blurry. Our projectionist said it was because the theater is so big and the screen is too far from the projector for this particular movie to work in 3D, but that others (Avatar, any animated movie, etc) work just fine in that theater. So either watch it in 2D or on a medium or small screen in 3D.",9,15,31,28 April 2011
The Matrix Reloaded," For big Matrix fans ONLY
","I know some people may disagree with me. So be it.I believe that unless you are a huge fan of the first MATRIX - and more specifically - of the story and concept (rather than the style and action), you will NOT appreciate this movie. You will probably not even like it.I have seen it twice now and can say that it's much better the second time around. Still, I enjoyed the original much more.RELOADED is not as instantly rewarding as the original MATRIX was. The style and pacing is different. There is much more focus on the 'philosophical' aspect, thus a lot more dialogue and less intensity.*** VERY MINOR SPOILERS ***I felt that some scenes were only there to please fans and meant very little to the story (Morpheus fighting an agent atop a moving semi truck, a lot of Neo's flying around, along with most of the extended action sequences.), while others just dragged on and on (the 'club Zion' party scene and the 'love' scene with Trinity and Neo, the 'burly brawl' scene, the 'dinner party' and cake scene, Link's home life, etc.).*** SPOILERS END ***It seemed they stuffed a lot in just to justify making two movies out of these sequels. They could have easily cut out at least half an hour without losing the gist of the story. This should have been the 'extended cut' like Jackson has done for the LOTR films. That way the cinema version could have been more tailored for regular audiences and been more enjoyable.Still, the story IS very very cool and I loved the twists that come and make you wonder what the Matrix 'really' is.As much as I liked the last 15 minutes (from just after the infamous 'Highway chase' sequence), I can't help but wish the overall film was polished down a bit.I give it 6 out of 10, and hope for a better-paced final act!Oh, and just to set it straight: This IS a positive review. :)",7,0,0,22 May 2003
The Lion King," The pinnacle of animated movies.
","The Lion King is absolutely Disney's greatest achievement to date and will long be hailed as such. The story is classic, but better yet are both the stunning animation and the inspirational score by Hans Zimmer. The songs are brilliantly written with music by Elton John (with help from Zimmer) and Lyrics by Andrew Lloyd Webber's long-time partner, Tim Rice. If you aren't among the millions that have purchased the video DO IT (if you can find it anywhere)!",10,9,11,27 September 1998
Cinderella," Nice, but forgotten?
","I can't believe no one has yet commented on this film, so I feel it my duty to be the first. This isn't one of Disney's best films (in my opinion), but holds it's own and is quite a beautiful story. With the mere fact that no one has yet commented on it shows how little of an impression it has on the general public today. Still, I believe anyone who thinks of Cinderella today thinks of mice, birds, and a plump and jolly Fairy Godmother; many of the elements first introduced by this delightful film. In addition, it spawned some classic songs like 'Bibbity-bobbity- boo', and 'A dream is a wish your heart makes.' I think my favorite part is the mice singing their 'we can do it' song while making a dress she can wear to the ball. I believe this movie was the first to introduce the concept of having two lovable side-kicks that the kids could relate to and enjoy: Gus and Jack (Aside from perhaps Thumper and Flower from Bambi). Disney realized the success of this much later and now include these types of characters in nearly all their animated movies. All in all I give it a 6Â½ out of 10, but respect it for what it is: A classic story that Disney made timeless and unforgettable.",6,0,4,22 May 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Not as good as people say, still a fine film.
","Certainly not the best of the three. That place still belongs to 'Fellowship'. And as much as I hate to agree with nay-sayers, I believe there were a few too many endings for a theatrical version.However, the good FAR outweigh the bad - redeem them even.The effects are absolutely top-notch and perhaps the best of all the films. The battle sequences were astounding! Best I've ever seen.START MINOR SPOILERSMy biggest gripe is with the opening sequence with Smeagel and Deagel. Andy Serkis just played him like a mindless grinning goon. Instead of making Smeagel a little bit more 'hobbit-like' with a normal speaking voice (not exactly the same as Gollums) and a more melancholy and serious side (not all child-smiles).END SPOILERSWhile I certainly agree that the film deserves some Oscars (but not director or film), I strongly disagree that Sean Astin, Andy Serkis or Viggo Mortensen deserve them for their acting. If anybody has earned a nomination for acting, it would be Ian McKellen and perhaps Elijah Wood.It felt almost like Mr. Jackson ran out of time editing and left stuff in that would have better found place in the Extended version.Still, this is an absolutely AMAZING movie. Perhaps I was just expecting too much.After first viewing, I give it 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,17 December 2003
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," True brilliance!
","This episode is absolutely the best! It roars with suspense and action, and lifts you out of your seat with the convincing special effects and inspiring storyline. From the snowy plains of Hoth through the swamps in Dagobah to the corridors in Bespin it keeps you on the edge of your seat and leaves you in anxiety anticipating the outcome to be revealed in the next episode. I remember waiting for hours in a line that twisted around the entire thater to see this when it was first released. It exceeded my expectations then, and still remains atop my list of greatest movies ever.",10,0,1,26 September 1998
Pocahontas," Wonderful musical from fictitious version of true story.
","Though not entirely surpassing the Lion King this was some of the best music ever experienced in an animated musical. Pocahontas is the daughter of a chief who wishes to find her path in life. She feels it her duty to keep peace between her own people and the intruding British who are hoping to find gold as did the early Spanish explorers. She finds herself falling in love with one of these new visitors and uses this relationship in attempting to prevent a potential war. But can she stop the greedy settlers from their determination to find Gold, and can she convince her Father that they should try to live in peace with their new neighbors? You may be pleasantly surprised. Between the music and the animation Pocahontas is a classic Disney film that should be included in every video collection. Just don't expect to learn any hidden truths about American history. Take it for what it is.",7,17,27,27 September 1998
