Requiem for a Dream," Absolutely Brilliant
","I have nothing negative to say about this movie. A forever favorite film that is crafted so eloquently with a striking and dark message. The dialogue, storyline, music, character development, acting, script, etc. are all phenomenal. Is it dark? Absolutely. But it's a masterpiece that delivers a meaningful message, even if it leaves you feeling empty afterward.",10,0,8,2 June 2019
