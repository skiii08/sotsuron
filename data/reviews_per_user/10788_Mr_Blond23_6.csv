Skyfall," Only those easily placated think this is a good Bond film
","This film could have been fantastic if not for the rampant and nonsensical plot twists.Sadly, Daniel Craig has had rotten luck as Bond, with the exception of Casino Royale.This movie is just another car in the train-wreck. The whole movie is about a guy hunting M, but M has no guards at all, not even in a parliamentary hearing. She doesn't even have a generic ADT alarm system in her house. Mysterious hacking is used to explain how a villain who is kept in a super secret secure glass cell escaped and killed armed guards and crashed a train through a subway tunnel. Not even to mention blowing up MI6 HQ which apparently anyone with a laptop and Verizon Fios can do now a days.After all the crap the Bond and M go through, Bond's most brilliant idea to escape Javier Bardem's oddly creepy Silva, is to go out into the country, without telling any of their allies, and playing Home Alone 5 with NO GUNS, NO EXPLOSIVES, and NO BACKUP. They easily could have just hidden M in a safe house (without a computer controlled gas line/built in terrorist self destructor button) and surrounded her with all the double 0 agents or something.What a turd of a film, and BTW in case you wondered what happened to Mr. White and the nefarious QUANTUM organization... TOO BAD, if you wanted closure watch season 6 of Sopranos, oh wait.BTW what happened to the NOC List, oh they didn't care about it nearly as much as Ethan Hunt did in MI-1.",5,5,12,15 August 2013
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A New Hope for the Star Wars franchise!
","This is the Star Wars film that has provided new found hope to die hard fans of the original trilogy (not the lame special edition or 1-3) and the expanded universe that Disney hastily abandoned. It comes at Star Wars from a newer, grittier and tactful perspective, that doesn't pander to young children at the expense of the overall story and film.The film has many strengths, the CGI was masterfully done, including the additions of Tarkin, Leia, and others. It is clear that considerable funds and effort was expended to ensure that the final product would be as close to the real deal of the original trilogy as is possible. Additionally, the cinematic shots in space and on planets are nothing short of beautiful.All of the major characters are played excellently, and despite the fact that we will never see any of them again, they each made an important contribution. Jyn was a powerful female lead that the writers respected enough to not place into a sappy love story with Capt. Andor. Krennic was a powerful yet flawed blue collar imperial the likes of which we have not seen before.The final hour in the movie, and the battle at Scarif was very well executed, and provided almost a video game like tactical and strategic feel that is familiar to fans of Timothy Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy. This is to say nothing of the scene where Vader shows up and slaughters everyone in typical Dark Lord fashion which was completely awesome! Of course there were down sides, though few and far between: 1. The imperials were made to be almost comically weak and inept, which makes you wonder how they rule the galaxy at all (Star Destroyers crashing into each other and troopers gunned down by the dozens like lemmings).2. Darth Vader's pun (choking on ambition) was out of character and really took away from the otherwise somewhat serious and supposedly frightening encounter between the Dark Lord and Director Krennic.3. The lack of the usual opening narrative/scroll was conspicuous and disappointing. Just because it is not an official episode doesn't mean that the intro could not have been included, after all most of the Star Wars shows, games, and even some novels managed to do it.All in all an excellent Star Wars movie that offers a promising glimpse of hope to all those disappointed by JJ Abrams' pathetic attempt to replace the EU. The film offers fans a passing wet dream of what it could have been like if Lucasfilm and Disney had not soiled the bed and instead simply created film versions of EU classics like the Thrawn Trilogy, which was a much more persuasive and compelling post-ROTJ vision. Disney would do well to remember that it is the older more mature Star Wars fans that have the money in their wallets to buy the tickets to these movies, and treat them accordingly by giving us what we want... and this time they did just that!",9,0,6,29 December 2016
Quantum of Solace," Not so hot
","People must look at this movie in two ways, it must be judged as a stand alone film in the bond series and as a sequel to Casino Royale (which I think is highly underrated on IMDb) As a stand alone bond movie, this movie was mediocre. A lot of people say it had action, but the rapid motion camera angles and succession of frames, made every attempt to comprehend what was in progress nearly impossible. Additionally, the plot was wholly deficient both in terms of character development and general story line. I mean look at how the movie started, in media res, bond is driving recklessly away from random thugs which are neither explained nor given a purpose in the movie other than randomly trying to kill bond. One must only assume that they are Mr. White's bodyguards who were never present in Casino Royale, even when their employer got shot in the leg or goes to kill Le Chiffre. Mathis is suddenly innocent with no explanation, and dies with the same lack of clarity. The movie had a few good scenes on the whole though, like the creative meaning of Quantum members at the opera (though quantum is the dumbest name for an evil organization). Another interesting scene was the pre-chase interrogation of Mr. White, and the following humor about having people everywhere. Without seeming to echo other generic critics of the movie, I have to say dominic greene was severely under developed and he could have been a really memorable bad guy. His henchmen on the other hand looked like a cross between stewart from mad-TV skits and a 40 year old virgin (with corresponding bowl-cut hair) As a sequel to casino royale, I think the movie is flat out bad. With the successful plot and character development of Casino Royale, they had a chance to make one of the best bond movies ever, but needless to say I think they dropped the ball. Instead of showing a cold angry bond out for revenge, this director misused Craig's clear talent, instead portraying bond as an almost incompetent agent who kills people because he doesn't fight well enough to keep them alive and question. In this respect, it is similar to Diamond are Forever where bond hunts down blofeld, though that was slightly more comical. He really has no clear motive to go after Greene, and only does so out of coincidence encounters with random people. Incidentally Bond seems to randomly stumble onto leads endlessly in this movie, from the surveillance of Quantum members, to meeting Camille, to the dammed water in bolivia. Greene's scene to control water in bolivia was not anywhere near on par with the organization portrayed in Casino Royale. Camille was another senseless character in that her reasoning for going after Gen. medrano was clich√© and quite topical. Felix Leiter I'm glad to say was one of the successes of this movie in terms of being a sequel. Additionally, oddly enough, the continuity of M (the director of MI6) going places virtually unguarded and getting into trouble hasn't changed. The Theme used for the film is hardly worth mentioning other than to say it was almost totally inappropriate to the movie.Though the bar was set high with Casino Royale being such a success, that doesn't serve to justify this movies complete disregard for bond tradition. There is no style in this movie, no seduction (especially with regards to Agent Fields, who just randomly appears to have had sex with bond, despite her earlier rigid personality), he doesn't even make a play for Camille. Finally , with some what of a petty detail, I must note that the gun barrel sequence was graphically very poorly done. If you are a true bond fan I'd see it just on principle, if you are just looking to see a good movie, I'd steer clear of Quantum of Solace. It isn't the worst James Bond movie ever (as that title has already been solidly claimed by On her Majesty's Secret Service, being that never say never again is not technically a bond movie), but it comes in a close second. In short, seeing this movie is another way to die.",5,1,2,20 November 2008
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Star Wars: Brought to you by corporate america and millenials with short attention spans, diluting the original since 1997
","I was hoping that a change in director, from the steaming pile that was Force Awakens, would have helped to dramatically improve the direction of this great franchise, especially after the critical acclaim of Rogue One. Sadly I was wrong. The plot was almost entirely pointless, with so many holes that it is as unqualified as a star wars sequel as one of Donald Trump's judicial nominees is for the Federal bench. The slow speed chase that consumes two-thirds of the movie simply makes no sense. The First Order could in theory go around them, rather than wait for them to run out of gas. Apparently, the First Order killed off an entire galaxy of republic leaders, warriors, and citizens, leaving not a single person in the galaxy far far away to come to the aid of Princess Leia, the hero of the Rebellion. With the knowledge that Carrie Fisher is dead, one would have hoped that the writers would have had the good sense to give her character a grand exit in a meaningful battle, and NOT have her FORCE FLOAT her way back into the ship and essentially pass out for the rest of the movie.WHAT WAS THE POINT OF SNOKE AT ALL... SERIOUSLY, I feel a great sense of sorrow for all the fans who expected something to come of the mystery only to be utterly disappointed by the lack of fanfare with which he is dispatched. The throne room fight was entertaining but absurd. Surely everyone has had their fill of Kylo Ren's emo/bratty Darth Vader knock off.The lone saving grace of the film as a star wars trilogy episode was Mark Hamill's overall performance as Luke Skywalker, in perfect step with where his character was expected to be in this cluster of a plot. He performed well, only to be let down by the writers who kill off Luke just as he bids a prominent return to the series. His lackluster death left much to be desired and little hope that episode 9 will turn a corner and reinvigorate a great franchise.I can only hope that LucasFilm will again game-change the cannon and simply make Timothy Zahn's Heir to the Empire series into a new sequel trilogy... though by the time that happens, hopefully the CGI will be able to bring the original cast back to life decades later...This was disappointing...",4,0,0,19 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Episode VII: Just good enough to continue the financial exploitation, AKA we're going to build a yuuuge Death Star and the fans are going to pay for it bigly
","Lets start with the fact that surprisingly, the movie is not 'a total disaster' as Donald Trump would say. It manages to entertain and in some minor ways surprise. But lets face it, if anyone says this is the episode seven they were hoping for, you can probably bet they are employed in some degree by the Walt Disney Corporation. Even George Lucas isn't a fan of this flick, but he has room to complain after selling out Star Wars to Disney, and making the prequel trilogy (ie Jar Jar Binks and Darth Vader's classic 'NOOOOOOOOOoooooooooo'.But as much as we all hoped Disney would succeed, this is what they came up with?! 1. A plot ripped not from the expanded universe that Disney tossed aside, but straight from a New Hope. Death Star with critical weakness that will blow it up, and search for droid with plans. The only difference between the rebel death star command center and the resistance death star command center is that Leia looks older.2. Kylo Ren is a colossal wuss. We all would have been happier is he either kept his helmet on the whole time or died at the end of the film.3. Han Solo's DEATH is dramatically anti-climactic. Colored only by Chewie's reaction, which barely saves the scene.4. The new Supreme Leader is hilarious not mysterious, basically just Golem from Lord of the Rings enlarged on an Abe Lincoln style chair.5. The First Order's General Hux is like a bratty kid and a pathetic replacement to Thrawn in the EU.In sum, Disney, and JJ Abrams should be lauded for making a new Star Wars film without over-using CGI and stupid characters to make it a kids flick. But whatever accolades they have coming should be substantially outweighed by the calamitous decision to abandon the Expanded Universe in favor of making a New Hope remake that barely holds water. Sadly, the mass marketed picture will likely only serve to encourage more films in this terrible direction.",5,5,14,3 January 2016
Spectre," The only Spectre involved is that of the movies that the writers stole from to create this Direct-to-Illegal Download crap
","First off, if you liked Skyfall, you will likely think this is a good movie, ...unfortunately...It is extremely disappointing that the franchise has produced another homage to the Michael Bay style of senseless streams of action sequences, inexplicable plot turns, and explosions. Despite finally recovering the rights to the SPECTRE monniker, and NAMING A FILM AFTER IT, the writers don't even bother to explain what the name stands for and do not develop the plot enough to create any sense of intimidating presence.It is left to the imagination as to how or why Quantum emerges now as the SPECTRE organization or how it encompasses all the varied bad guys Daniel Craig Bond has faced.The writers rather than reverting to the plausible and well executed plot style of Casino Royale, chose instead to throw Blofeld, Bond's past, his relationship with Judy Dench's M, and an absurd mashup of NSA cautionary tales of surveillance into a blender, to spit out something that desperate bond fans will waste money seeing just because of the possibility that for once we may get another good Craig film.THERE ARE SO MANY STUPID SCENES:1. The drill torture scene in which Swan doesn't really care Bond is dying, and no one seems to care she could be releasing him.2. The escape where, with one stray bullet, Bond hits the thermal exhaust port of the Death Star... er Secret NSA Spectre spy base.3. Blofeld (who is stupidly Bond's brother) spends hours in MI6 headquarters putting up pictures of Bonds family, colleagues, and enemies so that he can hurt Bond's feelings before he goes all Health Ledger Joker and makes Batman choose between Harvey and Rachel, I mean Swan and living.4. The head of the British Secret Service walks into danger with no security detail and barely manages to kill the bag guy by stealing his clip of bullets and tricking him into falling down the stairsBottom line: Bond meets half brother, half brother is bad guy, bad guy just changed him name to Blofeld... just because, and Blofeld gets arrested as Bond seemingly retires.To see a good Bond movie, just buy the DVDs of Dr. No-casino Don't waste money on this Direct-to-illegal download crap Unless you liked Quantum + Skyfall... then you'll love it.",3,8,18,8 November 2015
