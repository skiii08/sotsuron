Mission: Impossible III," Just not that good.
","I had hope for this film since it was directed by Lost creator, JJ Abrams and although the 3rd MI is an improvement over the 2nd film, which was simply horrible, it just left me feeling flat at the end. The action was fast-paced and entertaining, but it came at the expense of any character development. While the movie resolves around Ethan Hunt's new marriage and balancing that with his job, they dedicate so little time to developing Ethan and Julia's relationship it's hard to care what happens to either of them.No MI movie would be complete without a twist, and the twist in this one was revealed somewhat awkwardly and fell flat once again because we didn't know or care about any of the characters. If you're going to add 'human' elements to your action movie you have to spend time addressing the characters. However there's a part when Ethan is stealing something called the 'rabbit's foot' and instead of showing you how he gets it, the movie shows his team just waiting for him. They attempt in developing these residual characters during this scene, but it's too little, too late. Not to mention Ethan is pulling off quite a heist to get this damn rabbit's foot and we don't get to see what in the crazy he's doing!",5,0,1,19 November 2007
