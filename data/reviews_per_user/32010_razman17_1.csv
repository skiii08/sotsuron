Blade Runner 2049," First and last review. 5 stars.
","This is my first and probably last review of a movie on IMDb. I just watched the best movie in my life. Period. This is the third time I'm trying to enter 5 lines of review. This is the fifth line of review. It compiles all new lines into one big line and I need to write a little bit more to get to five lines. Aaaalmost thereeee, done.",10,3,12,7 October 2017
