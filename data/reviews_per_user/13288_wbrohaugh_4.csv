Blade Runner 2049," A Bit Slow at Times, but Worthwhile
","A standalone, but it helps to see the original.That said, it is in some places more engaging than the original (though that Rutger Hauer scene in the first is SF movie treasure). Yet, still an amazing extension of the first Blade Runner. True to the original, visually eye-popping, well acted, and a twist. of course a twist, not revealed here. Blade Runner fans, as well as SF fans in general, must see this flick",10,0,4,29 December 2017
Arrival," I can't praise Arrival enough
","After seeing Arrival the first time, I elevated it to my second favorite science fiction film of all time, behind 2001: A Space Odyssey. For perspective, Blade Runner(s), Alien (the first one) and Dark Star (lol) are runners-up, too, Watching Arrival the second time, I'm toying with the idea of placing it #1 on my list. It's that good, and must be high on the science fiction fan's must-see movie list. Adroit storytelling and editing, minimal but powerful visual effects, and--most important--a foundation of speculation of the role of humans as a species (and as individuals) in the universe that energizes SF.",10,1,2,29 December 2017
The Greatest Showman," Uplifting, Energetic, Satisfying Musical
","I saw it without reading any critical reviews. I was disappointed to afterwards become aware that some critics panned it. (There is an internal irony, in that at least one critic in the film panned PT Barnum.) So be it. I loved it. It's the Moulin Rouge of this decade. Great music, incredible choreography, strong acting, solid message. See it.",10,10,23,29 December 2017
Deadpool," When's the 2nd One Arrive?
","Not much of a fan of Marvel comics. Not much of a fan of Ryan Reynolds. Not much of a fan of superhero movies in general. So why do I love this movie so much? Chemistry. It all came together. It allowed this not-much-of-a-fan to laugh and cheer and have fun. It's like Galaxy Quest. You might hate the genre, you might love it. Either way, you can see the humor of poking holes in the genre, which the hilarious Deadpool does.As the headline intimates, I eagerly await the sequel.",10,1,2,29 December 2017
