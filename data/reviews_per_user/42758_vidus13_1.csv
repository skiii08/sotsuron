The Ring," probably the best horror flick ever
","Let me start off by saying that I am a horror movie fan.  I've seen almost everything.  It's odd how I say that, though, because now I know, after seeing 'The Ring', that I hadn't seen everything.  Or anything for that matter. This movie scared me so much that I was afraid to be alone, afraid to answer the phone, afraid to even turn on my TV.  I really loved this movie!  I think it's the scarriest ever ever ever... The plot twists, the suspense, and the visuals will keep you hooked and shivering.  The ending, too, is so surprising that you won't be able to believe it days after you've seen it.  The characters have a lot of depth and feelings...the settings are so eerie...the sounds...the visuals...everything is so perfect! I highly recommend this film...you must see it.",10,0,0,13 October 2002
