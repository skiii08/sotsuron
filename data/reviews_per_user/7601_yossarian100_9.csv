Scarface," Nothing more than average.
","Al Pacino, of course, does a good job with the lead role in Scarface. Unfortunately, he plays a character who is little more than a tough punk who gets sloppy and ugly on a coke habit, wasting everyone he's close to, and ends up, after almost 3 hours, getting what he deserved at the beginning of the film. There's nothing about his character for the audience to sympathize with. Too bad. This should have been a much better movie. Still worth watching, though.",5,2,5,13 February 2004
Train to Busan," Best Zombie Movie Since 'World War Z'
","Lightning fast action with no wasted energy. An excellent cast playing great characters move the story right along. There are no slow spots, either.Along with Zombie action, the movie deals with the ethics of emergencies, personal relationships, and what it means to be a father.Great camera work and a top notch script combine to make this a 'Must See' movie, even for those who don't like Zombie movies.This one is well worth your time, and will earn a spot on your movie shelf.Again, this is the best Zombie movie since 'World War Z.'",10,4,12,15 September 2016
Alien: Resurrection," Solid entertainment!
","With Resurrection, we finally get to have fun with both the story and the characters, thanks in large part to fine performances by Sigourney Weaver, Winona Ryder, and Ron Perlman. A French director puts a different spin on the storytelling and makes the movie much more entertaining. In the special edition, there's a funny new opening scene and an even better ending, along with added scenes which go a long way towards making this a better movie. Ripley becomes Maximum Ripley and almost every scene with her is a real jaw dropper. The movie is filled with witty and outrageous dialogue and most of that comes from Ripley. Resurrection is a seriously cool movie and I had a ball watching it.",10,6,9,6 December 2003
Insomnia," A well crafted film about integrity and redemption.
",A well crafted film about integrity and redemption.....thoughtful yet entertaining.....and Robin Williams makes a really good villain. Al Pacino over did his part a bit but still turned in a good performance. Hilary Swank's talent was wasted on the part they gave her but it was still nice to see her. I think most viewers will enjoy this.,Null,0,0,25 February 2003
Doctor Zhivago," One of the greatest films of all time!
","Filled with absolutely stunning photography and rock solid performances, Doctor Zhivago is a sweeping romantic adventure and one of the greatest films of all time. I watch this film at least once each year, as I have for almost forty years now, and it's as fresh and wonderful now as the first time I saw it. Amazing!",10,0,1,31 January 2004
Seabiscuit," One of the most entertaining and satisfying movies of the year!
","Having done some growing up on a ranch and having had a wonderful relationship with a rather unusual thoroughbred, I am a total sucker for a good horse movie. Seabiscuit is one of the best I've seen, however, so I make no apologies. Excellent performances, storytelling elevated to the art of fable, and beautiful photography makes one fantastic movie experience. Don't forget to keep a box of tissues handy, though. There won't be a dry eye in the house.",10,1,1,17 December 2003
Lawrence of Arabia," One of the greatest movies of our time, of any time!
",Lawrence of Arabia is one of the greatest movies ever made and Peter O'Toole gives one of history's finest performances. One simply cannot discuss this movie and do it justice. You must immerse yourself completely and savor every moment. One of the best adventure stories ever!,10,0,2,17 January 2004
No Man's Land," Excellent illustration of the idiocy and politics of hatred!
","No Man's Land succeeds by focusing on the idiocy of hatred at a very personal and human level instead of dwelling on a more general view. Since idiocy is often funny, the movie is often funny, too. Quite funny. However, as we begin to catch a glimpse of where all this is going, a sense of heart sickening futility creeps in. There is nothing that can be done, no matter how good our intentions and resolve are, and the end of the film is sobering, to say the least.",10,0,1,14 February 2004
Three Colors: Blue," Juliette Binochet took my breath away!
",The emotional impact of this amazing first film of an even more amazing trilogy was so strong that I had to keep reminding myself to breathe. Juliette Binochet does an incredible job without much in the way of dialogue simply by using that wonderfully haunting face of hers and the director took full advantage by giving us many long caressing close ups of her.,10,0,1,31 December 2003
