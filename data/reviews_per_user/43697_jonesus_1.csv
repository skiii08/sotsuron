Skyfall," Could do with some humour
","I have not really enjoyed the last few James Bond movies, however I still go along to see them hoping that one-day they will return to their former glory. Whilst 'Skyfall' is better than the last two, it still falls far short of good James Bond entertainment. The film lacks the large-scale sets, the gadgets, the humour, the glamour, and the escapist scenery. It is dark. Being a Sony (MGM) product, there are plenty of product placements in the film. One advantage of digital film making and projection is that it is possible to have a rock steady picture as there is no film movement in a projector gate. This showed up fairly unsteady camera work in the scenes in some interior shots. As they have by the end of this movie replaced the cast playing all the regular main characters except the actor playing James Bond, I hope in the next film the new Moneypenny, Q, and M will bring back some of the original Bond movie features again. Pity that they did not, whilst replacing the cast, find a new actor for Bond as well. I wonder where the money that they say it cost to make this film was spent. It does not have big sets, or a huge cast. Maybe some of the cast had high fees. Please Bond makers, bring us back the Bond we loved from the earlier decades.",7,4,11,13 November 2012
