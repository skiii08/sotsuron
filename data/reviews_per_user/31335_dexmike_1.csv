The Lobster," Can you spoil something so awful? *spoilers*
","**** spoilers**** Where to start with this pathetic combination of Von Trier and Wes Anderson. Pointless, juvenile, pointlessly cruel and just DUMB. Moronic premise that the unattached are forced to find mates or be turned into a lower species? Perfect matches are only found with similar weakness? A limp or bad eyes? Gaping plot holes, like asking which partner would be better off alone when the whole point of the film is that they CAN'T be left alone? Would be forced to re-couple or die. the mystery ending that's there why? The moronic idea that both partners being blind would somehow not end them both? They could only be together if they both shared blindness? That they would openly make out in the home of the leader's parents? I am AMAZED that this turd has a 7 rating. I could go on for about the length of the film as to why you shouldn't waste your time.",1,2,2,17 February 2017
