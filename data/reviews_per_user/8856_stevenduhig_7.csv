The King's Speech," Truly remarkable movie,,,
","If you are looking for sheer excitement, battle sequences or car chases, than this movie may not be for you.Of on the other hand you are looking for thoughtful drama, fantastic acting and historical insight this movie is IMHO without equal.Certainly helps if you know something of the history here, but I loved the audience knowledge assumptions made which meant that the audience does not feel patronized by the content.A little slow to start with, and perhaps very slightly long? IMHO It is one of those movies you need to allow yourself to be immersed in. Not simple entertainment but a highly skilled and very courageous and capable portrayal of an unprecedented, and largely secret, real life astonishing drama (British Succession), behind another astonishing drama on a worldwide scale(British leadership in WW2).The casting, screenplay, camera-work, prop/set detail and acting are simply extraordinary.My wife asked if this movie cried out for a sequel? My feeling is I would not have though it was intended, but if it did happen, and with this cast, than several ought to have an even better chance of an Oscar.Too many brilliant performances to mention.Sadly I do wonder however how much of a future in this industry lies with such wonderful full feature film works of art, as this movie was only viewed here by four people tonight!",8,0,0,20 January 2011
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Very good - Recommended
","Really liked most of this film but left with the feeling that it was perhaps too long for the written material. Character portrayal and acting was very good indeed. Special effects very good. Plenty of action all round. Certainly a different feelform the previous two movies too. One especially notable scene was the most amazing bombing sequence I have ever seen in any movie. You really felt you were in the shelter with them! Certainly left wanting to see again and to see more. Probably my favorite of the three so far, although I found the plot to be a little unconvincing. I think they could have got to Peter sooner...",8,0,7,19 March 2015
The Young Victoria," Well worth watching but is something missing..
","Enjoyed the movie very much. Certainly will leave the audience wanting to know more, and there is truly a lot more historically to find out!Did the production team fall to the temptation of over dramatization, particularly of the shooting event? There is a ton of interesting accurate material hinted at? Prince Albert's contribution to UK and the monarchy warrants a movie on it's own but granted that was apparently not part of the intention here.The costumes and sets are especially good but am I alone in thinking that this production (which judging by the length of titles at the end was certainly not a cheap one) wanted badly for a British Court historical etiquette expert beyond the Duchess of York? i.e. Did Princess Victoria really stuff an entire truffle/rissole(?) into her mouth while speaking to the Prime Minister in the company of His Majesty with her mouth full? 'Could never really felt that sympathetic to Victoriain this movie, or indeed in her shoes at all. Yet loved the casting of the principals, whose acting was convincing, so did the script really allow us to really get to know them well? I always felt like a totally detached, uninformed outside observer, much more so than with 'Mrs. Brown' or even 'The Queen'. Yet to be honest I still could not take my eyes off the screen, except that is for some of the more avant-garde camera techniques which were distracting from time to time.",8,3,3,21 January 2010
Passengers," Very entertaining.
","Surprisingly entertaining, despite what seemed to be, (even to the lead actors being interviewed on Graham Norton's show), a restricted idea, environment, basic story line and plot. It was though all kept simple and effective. What was written was used to the full and not overwhelmed by the excellent special effects. Leading actors were surprisingly good in my view, while Arthur the Android barman was in danger of stealing the show and some nice twists and turns. Ending could in my view have been developed a little more. The concept of infallible technology seemed to have some unlikely holes in it and as a result one or two parts were just a bit too fantastic. A really good family movie with a tiny amount of nudity. Highly recommended.",8,5,12,28 December 2016
Dunkirk," Awesome
","In my humble opinion, near perfect. Brilliant script, cinematography, soundtracks and acting. Mark Rylance in particular was in my humble opinion absolutely brilliant in his portrayal (based on a number of real incidents from a variety of vessels but using Titanic 2nd Officer Lightoller's role in Dunkirk as a foundation. Superb. Kenneth Branagh was notable too and not too dominant. Even Michael Caine's voice use on the radio was carefully done. My only content gripe was the unnecessary use of a 1950s railway carriage. The overall result a brilliantly directed, balanced and unromanticized war record including an incredible amount of subtlety (e.g. through the background to each and every single notable quote listed here) from a brilliant script right through to the order of titles at the end. Probably the most unique and best war film I have ever seen.",9,3,9,5 August 2017
Wonder Woman," Entertaining Movie - Good Fun
","Certainly a fun and entertaining movie. I particularly enjoyed the performances of the two leading actors. Some of the script is a bit of an ouch. The way that Princess Diana says 'Excuse Me' to her mother The Queen being one example early on. There was an over extended sexual undertone that I disliked in two parts of the movie. No bad language that I noticed, but one (unnecessary?) extremely sudden violent assassination of a German Officer shot in the head that had our audience gasping. Yes focus on 'Love' being good is there, but could probably write an essay on the anti-Christian aspects of this movie. Generally liked the CGI effects but the opening shots from a cliff of an island covered sea looked very unconvincing. A lot of trouble has been taken with WW1 period artifacts, costume and atmosphere. Some incredulity included as one would expect, such as the tiny WW1 bomb dropped by hand is not likely to result in an entire factory exploding instantaneously. Pretty sure there are a few continuity errors to. Is the pilot shown in flashback stealing aircraft without cap/goggles, pushing pilot with items on to the ground, only to crash in the sea with them on? 'Southern Railway (1923) carriage was clearly shown in 1918, yet some nice period props were made, including a Foden Steam Lorry which was destroyed later on in the film. Personally found the very sudden changes in period a bit tough to take. Movie seemed to want to cover enormous scope, but it really was entertaining.",7,4,10,13 June 2017
Spectre," Loved it..
","Hard to write about this movie. On the face of it there was nothing special about it at all. Yet I still found the constant level of action truly absorbing and entertaining, even though nothing much stood out. The acting was good and convincing in the traditional James Bond tongue in cheek way. Perhaps I am biased in loving to see so much of London too but I loved the locations and the lighting treatments too. Yet I have to return to the point that I really cannot point to any one thing that stood out as being extraordinary in this movie! Not one incident, stunt or chase. Hard not to compare with the latest Mission Impossible movie with its extraordinary stunts pushing the boundaries in very visual ways. In explicably I was more consistently absorbed by Spectre than MI. Somehow though I was totally absorbed in the escapism of it all, and recommend this movie without hesitation.",7,1,6,26 February 2016
