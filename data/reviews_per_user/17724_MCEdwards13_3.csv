Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I very nearly wet my pants and split my sides open......
","What a work of absolute genius. A gem of beautifully crude, highly uncomfortable and at most points, cringe-worthy comedy rolled into 84 minutes of perfection. Not a dull moment, not a yawn or a sleepy expression, only lots and lots of excruciating laughter from every single row in the Cinema. I won't spoil ANYTHING about this film, all I shall say is that you MUST go and see this as it is BRILLIANT! Probably, this film will not appeal to any prudes or people lacking a sense of humour. If you fall under this category, don't touch it with a bargepole. Everyone else... go to the Cinema NOW and enjoy! Not only will you NOT be disappointed, but you'll be talking about it for days, maybe weeks afterwards and waiting with baited breath for it to be released on DVD so you can roll around in laughter a second, third or fourth time!!!!",9,1,7,9 November 2006
Saw III," Absolutely the BEST Saw.... so far?
","I went into the cinema with a hopeful but open mind. In my eyes, Saw was good but not brilliant, if the acting and direction had been better, it would have been an awesome movie... Saw 2 was not as good as the first, but still had it's moments... Saw 3 TOTALLY blows the first two out of the water! The irony (well, sort of) is that without the first 2, the third would make no sense (well, duhhhhh). Very rarely do sequels out-do the original, but Saw 3 kicks arse! Once again, the acting isn't brilliant, but it delivers a much darker and wicked movie. I only wish the first two had been made this way. It was indeed a very clever formula that made for an enjoyable, if at times cringeworthy (i mean the torture scenes and booby traps) 90 or so minutes. I loved it being a big horror fan, go see it....

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Just a lot of walking really...
","Not a fan. Too long... FAR too long! Too drawn out... FAR too drawn out! The scenery is lovely, the cinematography excellent, the special effects brilliant.... other than that.... far too long and drawn out! Gollum was pretty cool, the other characters bored me.... Oh, I lie, the Orks were pretty cool, and those walking trees, they were cool as well. I wish I could say more about this, in fact not just this but the whole trilogy... I wish I could, but I can't! Sorry..... Far, far too long! They knocked the nail right on the head in Clerks 2... Just a lot of people walking... Some lovely scenery, stunning views, excellent special effects and lovely scenery (did I mention that?). If you like scenery, you'll like this film!",2,2,6,13 November 2006
