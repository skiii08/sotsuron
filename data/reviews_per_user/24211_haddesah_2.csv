The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Loved It! Beautifully Put Together!
","I loved this film. I usually dislike teen movies and generally avoid them, as I find them too shallow, tedious, repetitive of so many other teen movies, and boringly uninspiring beyond belief. Most are either badly acted, or directed, or bad script writing, or a little of each. Usually the teens have no respect, too much say and authority over their parents and other adults, are narcissistic and cause havoc wherever they go. This teen movie was different. It was beautifully well written, and directed. Beautifully acted. I was astonished by Emma Watsons acting abilities as I was never a fan. She is someone to watch as she matures more. I believe she will make an even bigger impact. But what I liked so much about this movie is the way the relationships flowed and blended so well together. I kept analyzing and thinking about it to find the right words and all I could think of is that it was like a beautiful slow gentle waltz. They embraced each other, comforted, strengthened, and upheld one another thru their own personal teen trials and heartaches that they were trying to overcome, so that eventually, one day, they would become responsible mature adults and accountable for their lives. It was sad at times but not darkly depressing. Their enthusiasm and joy for life bought you out of that. It was inspiring in a gentle way that gave you hope. And I just loved their joy. They had struggles in all areas that I so related to from my own teen years that most parents and adults don't want to see or hear about the drugs, sex, music, abuse, death, suicide, smoking, drinking, wanting and needing acceptance, times of loneliness, feelings of being an outcast and often a wallflower, and being misunderstood, making new friends, and enemies, which are usually bullies from inside and outside school life. all very real in my teen days ~ and I'm now in my 50s! But I have to say again, it was beautifully put together, it flowed and blended so well. It said it all without going into dark, deep, graphic details. You could really feel their friendship. It was emotional without being sentimental. It wasn't shallow or demeaning. They had empathy, compassion, and a healthy, respectful love for one another. And it gave hope as each one healed and grew wings, finding their first steps on a journey to their future and adulthood. Yes, this teen movie was different. It held my attention from beginning to end. It touched my heart, moved my feelings, and reminded me of my own past teen-life. When it ended I sobbed. Not with sadness, but with hope! This is one movie I would recommend my teenagers to watch as I think its sensitive and inoffensive ~ if they are struggling to come thru their teens this movie could help to give some of them assurance and hope ~ a hopeful expectancy of good things for their future.",10,0,0,28 February 2014
Pride & Prejudice," Wonderful period drama
","I loved this with Keira Knightley. Very well acted and the period costumes are so lovely and elegant. Has a little of everything in with the romance and drama. Hope even more will be made for the future as I just so love period drama's, watch everyone of them and never been disappointed. Its just a shame that some people somewhere in the TV departments here in South Africa are often very ignorant of the genre of movies and very misinformed as they have classed this one as a 'Comedy'....can u believe it?! They need an education in the meaning and understanding of the different lives, morals and culture of these era's, as obviously they have no idea at all about this time period....very sad actually, as they have totally missed the lovely quirkiness and gentleness of those times.",Null,1,3,27 August 2011
