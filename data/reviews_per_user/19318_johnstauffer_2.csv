Skyfall," Skyfall is a different type Bond movie... Really!
","Skyfall has outdone the bond series in action, pain, photography, and attention to detail, and possibly length. The effort to film knock-down action in exotic places is monumental. It has presented a villain that is downright frightening and effectively built up so that the viewer will truly be afraid of what he will do next. HOWEVER, the film falls flat when compared as the same genre as the definitive first half-dozen Bond films: This one is thoroughly downbeat from start to finish, and except for a half-hearted 'where-have-you-been' from M near the end, it is completely devoid of humor. The early bond films have been characterized as spoofs and tongue-in-cheek. Skyfall can better be described as 'Is it Over Yet? Give Me a Drink!'",7,1,2,30 March 2013
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," True to Author and Audience Alike
","I know that the movie (Narnia) made an impression on me when after seeing it I find myself still thinking about it the next day. In the 1960s, I felt that Lewis was just making his own version after reading his friend Tolkien's trilogy, but Narnia is very rich, and truly does stand on its own, admittedly interpreting Lewis' real life view of good and evil, Godlike and ungodly. While Tolkien's trilogy better remains read and not over-interpreted as a violent movie, Narnia works well as filmed, and I expect would be appealing to Lewis. Pacing is excellent, the mix of humor, fear, hope and emotion are fine, leaving one not wondering when the long picture will be over, but rather, with 'oh, what's next??!!?'",9,0,0,31 December 2005
