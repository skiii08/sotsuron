The Lobster," A Comedy?
","I don't know how this could be classified as a comedy, even a black comedy. In any comedy, I would expect at least to smile, not scowl through the whole thing.If this is supposed to be about. . . conformity, resistance to authority, love even . . . I can think of more appealing ways to deal with those subjects. 'Captures the nature of love in the 21st century.' Seriously? If that's what love is, don't let it anywhere near me!Like Youth, this is just another case of letting myself be influenced by critics raving about a movie, and then suffering through the entire thing waiting for something redeeming to happen, if only in my own mind, only to be disappointed in the end. In this case, sorely disappointed.Why I occasionally waste two hours at a time on drivel like this escapes me.",1,42,68,1 January 2017
Youth," Two Hours Wasted
","Well that is two hours of my life I won't get back.I understand that there is such a thing as an 'artful' film, and don't get me wrong, there are many I enjoy. But this is not one of them. This is one that is packed with star power to draw you in, but doesn't deliver on its promise.Although he is not well known, I recognized the face of Paul Dano and was excited to see him in it - that it might be a meaty role for him. I suppose his, and indeed, most, of the roles were well acted, but it's like putting lipstick on a pig - it's still a pig.Dull, slow moving, contrived, stultifying. If you're forced to see it, have a double espresso beforehand - otherwise, it will be like taking an Ambien.",1,9,15,7 February 2016
