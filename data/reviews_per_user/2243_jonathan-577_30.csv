Saturday Night Fever," fun till the last act
","Can you believe that only thirty years ago working-class social realism was a commercial cliché? This movie looks and feels like 'Taxi Driver' when the strobe lights are off, and there's cussin' and humpin' all over it. A lot of it is very fun, including the revelation of hearing that Bee Gees stuff in context, as seventies soundtrack music, which turns out to make perfect sense. And it's truly freaky to see John Travolta fawning over bedroom posters of Farrah, Stallone and Al Pacino, and realize that this guy was the next wave - at this remove he's one of them, but here he's standing outside looking in. And he's been caught in the turnstile ever since, of course. Unfortunately the class politics do get pretty muddled, especially in the love-interest department - however pretentious what's-er-name's upward mobility turns out to be, their partnership does turn out to be a means of 'getting out,' an unnecessary conceit. And in order to justify that conceit, things get laid on pretty thick; the paper-thin ironic distance is suddenly dropped, buddy pulls a Sal Mineo on the bridge, and you half think that Badham takes Travolta's ex for a 'c*nt' too.In other words, it stops being fun. I had to entertain myself by imagining that Robert Stigwood optioned 'Wedding in White' and morphed it into this script in one very loud, three-hour story meeting. Coulda happened!",6,9,11,25 August 2007
3:10 to Yuma," jam packed, good stuff
","Seen on a double bill, I hardly expected to like this movie more than 'A Fistful of Dollars', but damned if it ain't true. In spite of the rather silky Bush-era hairstyles, it's a ringer for a good A western of the classic era - no doubt because it lifts most of its script from one. Like all my favourite Westerns, it is anti-heroic; the good guys and bad guys shade into each other until there's some doubt about who is who, and it manages this without being corny. Themes aside, it's been a long time since I saw a movie that packed this much visual information into its first five minutes; the set pieces are all riveting; the performances live up to the production - it obliterated my Russell Crowe block. My minor complaint is that the fleeting outsider's nod to the Chinese railroad slaves should have been more detailed and defined; as it is it feels like guilty liberalism. My major complaint is about the ending; there's a couple ways to take it ideologically I guess, but the bottom line is that it just doesn't work. But it wasn't such a turnoff that I didn't spend a long time thinking about it, and overall this is way better work than I expect from Hollywood these days.",8,2,4,8 December 2007
I'm Not There," do the homework first
","I know a bit about Dylan, and I understand why people who don't would not get as much out of this, especially the born-again stuff and Richard Gere's extended riff on 'Renaldo & Clara'. And maybe it's just my own preoccupations, but I find that this is most engaging when it's dealing with the clash between celebrity 'protest' culture and personal artistic vision - which mainly means whenever the brilliant Cate Blanchett is on screen. She REALLY has a field day with the man in his undeniable prime. All seven Dylans do the job though, and the stylistics mostly enhance rather than confuse - I love the Beatles and Ginsburg cameos and anything taking place on a freight train. The stuff involving his 'wife' tends to lose me a little though, and when the 60s snapshot montages descend, look out Time-Life Video. I do like the balanced and critical take Haynes has on Dylan's self-centered myth-making, taking stock of both the pleasures and the falsehoods - sometimes the pleasures ARE falsehoods.",8,1,3,24 February 2008
Star Trek," gloriously emotional space opera
","How much of it is me and how much of it is the movie? While I'm a Star Wars guy myself, I did grow up with the series, a Spock fan before I could write, and it goes without saying that this movie fully exploits the cultural benchmark it franchises: everyone can have fun with the uncanny casting, largely played for surprisingly deft comic relief. And while I could care less about the Trekkies, you can't help but admire the way this film sets out to circumvent purist quibbles: by opening up a channel in time, it creates an alternate 'reality'. This happily relieves the filmmakers of many cumbersome obligations to the source material, thus allowing it to concentrate on the true nucleus, the 'logic versus emotion' conflict embodied in the Kirk-Spock partnership. And by exploring this tension both between and within these characters, it achieves something quite remarkable. Not that I've been keeping track, but I doubt there are many space operas out there with this much invested in its characters - and with this kind of sweeping emotional resonance. Which immediately removes it from the Star Wars column and puts it closer to the epic war-buddy films of the classic Hollywood studio era - although I've never cared for one of those the way I care for this one. Shout out to Scotty's little green buddy, who astonishingly establishes himself as the most empathetic secondary character with about thirty seconds of screen time and zero words spoken.",9,1,8,10 June 2009
Inglourious Basterds," a master popularizer at his very best
","Tarantino was never much of a philosopher, humanist, or world historian – just someone so utterly immersed in cinema that he could translate his obsession into terms that seemed not just relevant but also emotionally engaged. Now, at a rather troublesome and ambiguous moment, he takes on the Nazi film, with Bowery Jews and Southern lieutenants teaming up in a simple-minded crusade against Evil. In so doing, he offers more evidence that he's drinking from a bottomless well – that the movies can, and should, do anything. This is especially propitious since it comes along at a moment when cinema history is going down the toilet almost as fast as world history. More than ever he's playing the film prof here, but unlike his Americanism, his cinephilia is not triumphalist: he knows too much about his subject to lie about it. Glorious tributes to Sergio Leone and Raiders of the Lost Ark (and King Kong!!) vie with articulate digs at Pabst and Jannings and nitrate film. And yet it's anything but an in-crowd movie; I'm sure I don't get half the references myself. Instead, he sculpts these elements as a master popularizer, boiling them down into a teeming, bizarre concoction that is both devastating and offhand, manic yet full of grace, a jokester who delivers the punchline as if his life depended on it. And while you can always hear him talking, it's the overtones and cross-rhythms of his superbly attuned cast that bring it to life. This is as close to profundity as this man will ever get - pretty damn close.",10,18,37,7 September 2009
Coraline," terrors of childhood
","I happily got to see this not just in 3-D but with Neil Gaiman in attendance, and he talked about how the whole story is basically an edit of the bizarrely appalling stories his five-year-old daughter had told HIM. I hope that settles the question of whether semi-horror material is suitable for children, already. The interesting thing is how the genre is transformed by the demographic - in place of shocks, we get cold creeps oozing out around the edges of extremely terse tonal control. It's so level, so deliberate, that at first it's kind of disorienting, wrong. But that's just another way of situating the horrors in the 'real' life of the heroine - they are a continuity or a mutation, not a break, from her neurotic home life. Neurotic, not evil - another coup; the parents are dimensional and comprehensible even though they are also a serious pain in the ass. Looks great, of course.",8,0,3,18 March 2009
Juno," keep the laffs comin' guys
","The post-credits store sequence openly dares you to hate this movie's mannered, artifice-riven dialogue, but soon enough the disarmingly low-key performers are making me love it. And hell, so is the dialogue itself - if the Marx Brothers can do it, why can't Diablo Cody? And as long as you're being witty, who cares how your movie reads as allegory? Unfortunately, that 'as long' comes to a jarring halt when the adopting parents' marital issues go public, in the process defanging this charmer the way Louis B. Mayer neutered Harpo. You could imagine an insightful movie about aging counterculture types clinging to their youthful rebellion as a matter of stunted emotional growth instead of principle, but why get all serious about it? That's what sitcoms do. Why not make your points through the comedy that we came for?? Movies that put this much stock in the intelligence of kids should not resort to finger-wagging - and those saintly salt-of-the-earth parents deserve at least one serious character flaw each (being working class is NOT a character flaw).",7,0,5,16 April 2008
Cloverfield," eat the yuppies
","This movie helps put Diary of the Dead into perspective - it's got the same eat-the-yuppie-scum-before-they-breed subtext, but it's more felt, less metaphorical. Also rather emptier; also way tenser. And what it lacks in auteurist readability it makes up for in the roller-coaster excitement that Romero has consciously forsaken. The lapses in logic have all been well-catalogued, although I'll warrant that the National Guard is so accommodating they could be from Sweden, and that the final long money shot of the M-O-N-S-T-E-R makes me nostalgic for Val Lewton. But the set pieces are classic, and the found-tape structural logic is more convincing than Romero's, too. And for all their generic, stupid hatefulness, the characters are more felt and more dimensional.",8,0,2,24 February 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," begins when it should be ending
","To my astonishment, I actually found myself enjoying this round about the 80-minute mark! This is when Burton finally allows the gore to splatter with some velocity, and when the cast starts to sing while moving around and doing things. Up till then every time someone utters a note everything freezes dead and it's a cue to get up for popcorn/the crapper. What a remarkably tedious score - Phantom of Fleet St., someone please slit my throat. I haven't seen any Burton for years, so I couldn't tell you if he's been losing his sense of humor and composition over time or if this book caused him to lurch suddenly into the blahs. The performances (all well within the actors' pre-defined range of shtick) can be quite enjoyable when they're not drowning under oceans of song, but the source material keeps Timbo on a consistently short leash, and on top of everything else the CGI sucks.",5,2,6,24 February 2008
Blades of Glory," (crotch) in-your-face humour
","I'm thinking this is my favourite of the four Will Ferrell comedies I've seen - no received nostalgia or Halliburton cameos to disrupt the high-concept laffs. Jon Heder can't really match Ferrell mug for mug, but both serve a burlesque of homosexual panic so broad and overt that I can only imagine how it played in theatres. Ferrell is really walking an impressively sustained tightrope with his embattled masculinity routine, and he keeps finding new angles with each project. Arnett and Poehler are great in support - check out their JFK-Marilyn routine. As usual, this peaks in the second act, when things are going badly; can't beat the ice capades shtick. But it sustains to the end; my roomie looked out in bewilderment at what all this hysterical laughter was about.",8,1,2,25 January 2009
Taxi Driver," An impossibly complex cinematic colossus
","As a text, this thing is extremely hard to get a grip on. Surely we're not expected to empathize with this lovable cabbie's bad analysis about human scum and end times, and surely the catharsis that he gets from his rampage at the end is not supposed to extend to the audience (or to Iris for that matter - can you imagine how bored she is once she gets shipped back home?) But just as surely, everyone on set agrees that things are f*cked and there's not much else by way of a solution. These points are made all the time, by filmmakers as well as other thinking human beings, without baring the least insight or interest. The point here, drum roll please, is that this is an incredibly layered and vital piece of film-making, one that takes off in directions that the script can't even begin to imagine. Part of this is that the dialogue is treated as complete, abject banalities that don't come close to expressing what's going on inside the heads of the characters. These characters don't have the verbal tools to let their humanity out - especially on the big screen, there is just so much meaning conveyed by the eyes, between lines. The stilted words are surprisingly comic, while the subtext is tragic. And meanwhile all this is embedded in the most gorgeous, abstract, kinetic and textured array of images that, I am prepared to suggest, has EVER existed in a Hollywood film - and I'm also prepared to suggest that the jet-black surges of Bernard Herrmann's score carry all the meaning anyone needs.",10,0,1,17 April 2008
Duck Soup," Take THAT, three-act paradigm!
","This is the greatest film the Marx Brothers ever made, and the funniest sound comedy I ever expect to see, because it turns them loose full force against the institutions of government and war, exposing them to such apt and merciless ridicule that the movie actually appears to be ABOUT something. By denying us the usual musical hiatuses - violently; a piano lid actually crashes down on Harpo's fingers - they even throw culture itself on to the same rubbish heap, in the process building a head of momentum that is so powerful as to be positively disorienting. Nowhere else are the brothers' strengths deployed in such effective tandem, with Groucho's lecherous misanthropy clearing a channel for Harpo's horny berserkitude and Chico's forehead-smacking wordplay. Dumont is at her irreplaceable best too. And as if to prove exactly how unstoppable they are, they did it all under the watchful eye of a McCarthyite fink - who must nonetheless deserve some credit for making the thing look and move like an actual movie.",10,1,2,18 March 2009
Cross of Iron," Sam battles Julius to a draw
","This is a flawed film. There are a few occasions when the sweeping grandeur gives way to a mere reading of lines. And the accents are all over the place, which of course is the price we all pay for having James Coburn, James Mason and David Warner as the most sympathetic Nazi soldiers since Leni Riefenstahl. But the payoff is a movie that seems to reflect an insider's knowledge of how men actually behave when at war. Sure it's also working on an overtly allegorical level - but the allegory is about class, not race much less 'freedom' or something: Coburn's weary pro soldier and Maximillian Schell's aristocratic Prussian general have Hitler surrounded with their mutual disdain, leaving you to ponder all the chaotic lives papered over by the theatre of fascist discipline. Most of the time, it's just about your dream scenario of what would happen if Sam Peckinpah were to direct a script by Julius Epstein. These are two brilliant but flawed artists slugging it out in the rectangular ring, a man of action meeting a man of intellect, and while the attenuated sentimentality they share does peek through in their respective ways, on balance it's just thrilling. The medical leave sequence is as brilliantly conceived and edited as the explosion that puts us there, and the double-amputee soldier who offers the general a foot to shake is worthy of Lewis Milestone. The battle scenes, it should go without saying, take you there.",8,0,1,18 October 2007
Ratatouille," fine lookin' fun
","Okay, it's basically great, and I'll give Brad Bird enough credit to suppose that he resisted, kicking and screaming, when Disney imposed that 'great artists shalt not STEAL' subplot so impressionable young uns will stop using Itunes. The Be-An-Artisan-Not-A-Corporation message is a bit of a head scratcher in corporate context, but maybe makes sense in a Wizard of Oz, leave-us-alone way. That Creole boss guy needs some better mayhem, Anton Ego seems to be Disney's attempt to neuter Tim Burton in absentia, and I'm sorry but Linguini is a drip. Complain, complain, complain. It's also fun and looks great, and gives you shivers in the big high spots like the best Hollywood animation, and there are no musical numbers either.",8,1,2,2 January 2008
No Country for Old Men," creepy crawling
","The most central conceit of this movie - and it's a brilliant one - is its slowness. Life in Texas is slow, so this movie is slow, this heist is slow - even the psychopaths are slow. Someone has been watching 'Young Mr. Lincoln'! Only here the point is a rising nervous tension that is allowed an outlet, if not a release, as it is punctuated with random and unpredictable bursts of violence. Why are people so het up about Josh Brolin's anticlimactic fate? This ain't Sergio Leone - a conventional showdown would be as disruptively wrong as the third act of 'Juno'. Personally, it's Tommy Lee Jones who loses me - what's he on about? But that's more than balanced out elsewhere - by Javier Bardem, of course, and by the uncanny and eerily seedy production design, evoking a 1980 where an irreversible decay has already laid its killing roots.",8,1,5,17 April 2008
District 9," alien underclass warriors
","Ideologically, the main attraction here is the absolute and savage refutation of the individual-versus-the-corrupt-system cliché – you know, 'Mr. Smith Goes To Washington' and all that. When the anointed leader of the alien-concentration-camp operation (Sharlto Copley as a nondescript bureaucrat, a fascinating and brave choice for an action movie protagonist) starts physically embodying the error of the us-and-them approach to the alien invasion, he is not only deposed from his seat of power, he's sent straight to the basement, where the secret labs are. Not only that, he remains an opportunistic rat bastard almost to the very end of his mutation. Still though, as an allegory it's pretty messy. If producer Peter Jackson wanted this to be his 'Intolerance' – atonement for the unga-bunga racism of his 'King Kong' – then he kind of goofed by making all the African ganglords into grinning cannibals. Rejecting gauzy sentiment is one thing, but those scenes play like Nollywood with a budget, which is the last thing the world needs On the other hand, this is exactly the kind of ideological blind spot that is all over the place in all but the very greatest of classic speculative science fiction, and THAT is the pigeonhole this movie fits best. It's not a metaphor, it's a specific imagined situation: what happens when the 'alien invasion' of yore smacks up against late capitalism's grotesquely elephantine military-industrial complex? This is a compelling rendering of that premise, even if they cheat by ditching the mock-doc conceit in the second act; it was really just a device to compress the exposition. And boy, is it ever compressed; the roller coaster moves fast enough to jump the gaps, holding steady until almost the very end, when a gratuitous bionic suit shtick provides one spectacle too many.",8,1,3,7 September 2009
I Am Legend," shut up and lurk
","An effective evocation of post-apocalyptic loneliness and heartbreak as buff scientist Will Smith, who does great work here, experiences the big city as jungle. As long as he's on his own with his dog, this is quite riveting, and there are several good suspense sequences and emotional moments. But when it tries to get deep it slips badly. The talking-to-mannequins stuff just doesn't work, and can you get more corny than using the Other Survivor as a pretext for a Science Versus Religion debate? The stuff about the zombies' social/kinship instincts fails to engage for the simple reason that they all look and act like they were in a video game. And the ending is insufferable. Can you imagine how much more Land of the Dead would have sucked if they got to Canada and it really WAS a utopian refuge? (shades of Joyce Weiland - 'ORGANIC GARDENING') Well it wouldn't have been any worse than what these guys make of Vermont.",6,1,2,17 April 2008
The Hurt Locker," trying to not stay human
","To Siue's protest that the world already has too many war films that focus on the American GI's point of view, I replied that this film takes that warhorse places that I've never seen it go before. Without that defining perspective, how else could Bigelow portray the psychology of war in which everyone, and everything, becomes an enemy - not just the curious and unknowable locals, but a cell phone, an illegally parked car, a herd of sheep, a pile of garbage, even their army's own sh*tty equipment? When Jeremy Renner drops the tear gas on his first assignment, it looks like he's committing suicide, but here again we have a window on an essential theme - the tension between the need for fellow soldiers to act in a predictable and regimented way, and the need to retain your status as an individual. At first Renner is as remote as the locals, but there's a slow reversal - starting with an admiring, smirking colonel miles crazier than he is, continuing as the seemingly rock-steady Anthony Mackie reveals the cracks in his own stability, and culminating in the Aguirre-like desert siege where Renner holds everything together and becomes the central character once and for all. Having taken center stage, the movie becomes his personal psychodrama as he seeks the killers of a kid he thinks he knows - it's when he tries to be a hero that we can see the hopelessness of the situation. The only way to survive is to keep your humanity in check, and it's damn hard, because these characters are nothing if not human. The chaos and despair are so powerful and so felt that the final scenes feel a little too pat, too obvious in their meaning; but even there we have an unforgettably displaced supermarket-as-nightmare sequence, and anyway the message is urgent enough to merit a double underline.",9,13,21,14 October 2009
Slap Shot," I have seen the future of rock and roll and it is the Hansons
","Paul Newman as foulmouthed captain of bad minor-league hockey team that gains a following when they bring on the legendary Hanson Brothers and shift focus to beating people up. This one is a totally hilarious parody of machismo, without moralizing thank God; there are gestures toward conventional Hollywood morality, but they are almost always brutally undercut. The characters are all recognizable types that you never see portrayed in movies with such rigor, eg the sex-crazed teammate who is also totally disgusting (he keeps wiggling his tongue). And now I understand why the Hansons are punk-rock heroes, they are absolute superstars in the Warhol sense of the word. An American film that actually refers to Peterborough, Ontario by name; meanwhile Canadian features were doing everything possible to conceal where they were made in the name of being more like American films! Oh the irony. NB there is one 'kind but stupid' Francophone which I suppose constitutes a stereotype. And yes, it is Written By A Woman.",8,1,7,27 December 2006
Children of Men," wow
","We have entered the era when a five- (or ten-) minute single take action scene can be faked digitally and everyone knows it - which means that the jaw-dropping power of these ones is no longer a matter of 'how did they DO that?' Instead, it's a matter of conceptual force and directorial control: each of these shots embodies the movie's vertiginous ride through a familiar world utterly transformed and rendered in gripping detail. The way it grafts Big Brother resonances onto an immigrant-persecution narrative is very satisfying, even if the politics are then undermined by yet another gang of meet-the-new-boss revolutionaries. Sure they're saddled with the master's tools, but ultimately they look to me like straw men, to be rejected in favour of the miracle-of-childbirth fantasia. When the world's last pregnant woman is rescued from her fogged-in dinghy by a renegade cruiser called 'Tomorrow,' it doesn't just feel like disruptive irony; it feels like, just maybe, Cuaron's political program is to wish the world would go away. But then again, wouldn't you? And anyway these are basically plot issues; the texture in the characterization, the feeling for distant continuities with the present, and the many mysteries barely glanced on the margins (like, exactly how old are those hoodie-urchins who throw stuff at the train?) make this movie a pleasure and a thrill, and how nice to see Michael Caine in such a beautiful little persona-twister as this.",9,2,12,2 October 2007
Grindhouse," dizzying and spectacular and passionate and great
","Take it from someone who has been watching crapola of a certain vintage for months and months - this movie knows of what it speaks. It doesn't speak it with complete fealty - Rodriguez's editing rhythms and camera moves are more early 80s, that is when he's not imposing the jump-cut rhythm of mangled prints to absolutely brilliant effect. It's like ballet, and it's exciting and hilarious. Tarantino's is more 'deep grindhouse' or 'the whole action' - OF COURSE the actors won't shut up, because this is the rhythm of the grindhouse. You have to be bored to cutesy tears for hours before you are rewarded with the spectacular car chase - and even though the boredom here has no thematic relevance whatsoever to the era, the structural message gets through and I think it's pretty brilliant and audacious - BECAUSE it's boring, is it all right for me to think that? Anyway we can hardly demand even more breathless excitement immediately after an hour of Rodriguez and! and! the trailers, oh my god. Thanksgiving.",9,0,0,7 June 2007
Some Like It Hot," brilliantly orchestrated chaos
","The most astonishing thing about this movie is that it works at all. I love Billy Wilder but The Seven Year Itch drove me right up the fricking wall with its testocentric mugging, and why should this movie have been any different when it pulls the same trick? Well first off, the context has opened waaay up: it appropriates the St. Valentine's Day Massacre as its inciting incident, it sweeps from Chicago winter to Florida sunshine. And this time, the filmmakers figure out how to construct an interesting critique of masculinity through the medium of Marilyn. Give us TWO male protagonists, joined at the hip; give us some gangsters to put their hormonal aspirations into some critical context; and by the time you've thrown in Joe E. Brown's lovable goofball playboy, the layering is so intense that it almost begins to resemble depth, and the construction so disorienting that it constantly feeds the comic requirement of surprise. That Tony Curtis's impersonation of a British millionaire sounds more like John Clarke only adds to the fun. And while Marilyn is still Marilyn, she's also looking a little rough around the edges here and there - her on-set nervous breakdown seems to have been incorporated rather than papered over. Brilliantly orchestrated chaos, suggesting that Wilder is only really Wilder when he's also A. I. L. Diamond.",9,1,3,11 October 2007
The Departed," Frustratingly enjoyable
","A frustratingly enjoyable movie, it ALMOST gets there. It's got more emotional guts/nakedness than Scorsese usually allows these days, but those guts are isolated in DiCaprio and Vera Farmiga's performances. Nicholson isn't out of control, exactly, he's just a symptom of Scorsese's tonal problems: he's playing vaudeville, while DiCaprio plays psychodrama and Farmiga and Matt Damon are playing repression. Except unlike Farmiga, Damon can't (or doesn't) suggest the complexity of what's going on under that repression. I liked how the excitement techniques were embedded in a relatively intimate, character-based approach where Goodfellas, say, is ALL direction. But as a result, when things blow up at the end, it feels pretty cheap, and I say fooey on the jokey final shot.One more thing: the street-language is almost as automatic a mannerism as the Rolling-Stones-over-tracking-shot business. The homophobic stuff is put to use in terms of the themes of masculinity and role-playing, but the racist s*** is really getting old.",6,1,3,27 December 2006
There Will Be Blood," Daniel Day-Lewis DEFINITELY trumps Adam Sandler
","This one is haunting me big time. Magnolia had me convinced long ago that Anderson was a showboating poser, but now I'm going to have to take a second look because this film takes the horror-farce high wire of Punch Drunk Love and runs it through an astonishing Daniel Day-Lewis, with exactly the uptick you'd expect. For two hours it looks like the only thing funny about this literalist travesty of American Dream individualism is going to be his unerring John Huston imitation; but as the third act rounds the bend, the appalling things that Day-Lewis is party to become increasingly tinged with existential ludicrousness. And his predilection for avoiding big, substantive struggles by only picking on the biggest weakling available at any given moment leads abruptly to a climax that is equal parts wrenching, horrifying, jaw-dropping and laugh-out-loud hysterical. I've never seen anything like it, and it makes me question my reactions to everything that came before - it DEMANDS to be watched again. This is what bravura means to me, not raining frogs. You pity the rest of the cast for having to share the screen with Day-Lewis, but somehow everyone manages to keep the sense of ensemble: forget the Oscars - Paul Dano deserves a purple heart!",9,2,5,17 April 2008
The Wrestler," hopelessness as redemption
","Just for a change, let's talk about Evan Rachel Wood. As the daughter of this movie's absolute focal point, the anabolic phoenix you-know-who, she gives a hyperventilating, overwrought, method-ish performance, especially in the last of her three scenes, when she slams the door on the long-lost stumblebum's last chance at redemption. The effect is jarring, wrong: she seems to be coming in from another world, or at least another movie. And then, days later, you realize that you have been caught, sucked into seeing Wood from the wrestler's point of view: he can't possibly understand her either. The years apart have rendered the divide unbridgeable, little miss Emo versus a guy who has learned to accept every sort of punishment as a way of life. She is truly gone, and this is why he rejects Marisa Tomei's attempt at a happy ending: refusing to chase the shadows of domestic bliss is his own brand of wisdom. This kind of working-class fatalism is a sentimental fallacy, running through ring movies from the dawn of time; but it is so perfectly played and so dramatically inevitable that you understand its truth even as you struggle against it. None of which would mean much without the anabolic phoenix, whom I've never seen in a lead role before and whose shattered stoicism would have been just as devastating if this were his first film.",9,1,1,25 January 2009
WALL·E," Captain knows best
","This movie really gets off on the right foot - it's tale of inter-robot courtship and conflict amid the ruins of planet Earth is full of character, nuance and charm. I sure don't scoff at the skill that goes in to the characterization of these guys, especially given the initial absence of real verbal content, and there are great visual ideas everywhere. Their exploits remain charming and funny as the action moves up to the space station, where machine fed human-blobs await salvation. But I find the blob-people annoying and TOO cute up against the robots. Worse than this, though, is the machine-tooling of the moral. Listen, kids: Hollywood's sentimental narratives of human progress used to depict change which was led, however unconvincingly, from below. Here it's down to the blob ship captain to save humanity for his underlings. So, for all the explicit urgency of the environmental-catastrophe messaging - and in spite of the identification young viewers are obviously meant to feel with the consciousness-raising robots - the net effect is to reassure the viewer not to worry, that Big Daddy will take care of everything if we just bleep truth to power. I guess Junior will just have to figure out the rest for him/herself...",7,0,2,18 March 2009
Halloween," creepy above all
","Needless to say, not as abjectly terrifying as it was when I was 12, and it was 2 am, and the lights were out, and I was alone. In 35mm widescreen, which is how I was lucky enough to watch it this Halloween, the now-you-see-him-now-you-don't shtick is less than subtle, and at this remove I find myself critically appraising the stylistic devices instead of being swept up in them. I guess that's what happens after you've seen a horror movie twenty times. Michele hadn't seen it before, and she was scared. And I guess it's impressive that Carpenter aims not for shocks or grossouts but for creeps - whenever anybody turns their head, the boogeyman is behind them, watching. The accusation that this sets the template for the 80s' f*ck-and-die fetish is tempered by the fact that these teenage women are brilliantly detailed and likable, certainly more so than silly old Donald Pleasance who spends half the movie in a shrub. And Carpenter is at pains to indicate that this movie is really about other movies, about the process of being scared - and also about the pleasure of inventing your own icon. Michael Myers is here, get used to it.",8,1,2,11 November 2007
Slumdog Millionaire," a class-conscious fairy tale
","What looks at first like a joyous allegory is in fact a class-conscious fairy tale - a kinetic, color-drenched, sublimely symmetrical rags-to-riches number. Its scope and detail more than justify its tourist's-eye view of the complexities of Indian shanty life: the enormity and unspeakable beauty that pervade the thing match our uninformed preconceptions, while filling in key details helpfully and gratifyingly. And it's all there in the service of the story, which aims to literalize the 'education' that one gets trying to survive on the bottom rungs of the social ladder. Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, I loved it. And thank God for the happy ending, although they better be getting the hell out of Dodge given the vendettas left dangling.",9,1,3,25 January 2009
The Birds," Wish I'd been there
","Just like Psycho, this stroke of technique would have been interesting to watch in innocence, before EVERYONE knew what was going to happen. (If there was ever such a time - how did they advertise this?!) It's as though, having established his new identity as a hack-ripping horrormeister, Hitch then decided to hack and rip his own oeuvre. The first hour of this plays out as a very straightforward - even dull - light romance with comic overtones - 'To Catch a Thief', say, divested of intrigue and relocated into the swinging 60s. Then suddenly, very late in the proceedings, everyone starts getting their eyes pecked out! To an extent the joke's on us, because the first half is annoying and the second not consistently scary. But boy does it have its moments, and the sheer misanthropic audacity of the whole enterprise is impressive and worthy of our admiration.",8,4,7,17 April 2008
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," it's ABOUT stupid, stupid
","This may be a stupid movie, but it's not made by stupid people - its subject is stupidity, aka machismo. Which is nothing new for Will Ferrell - the question is, does it hit the bulls-eye? And the answer is: not really. There's plenty to laugh at, but two weeks later there ought to be more stuck in my memory than the Highlander reference and the 'profiling' jukebox. Well, admittedly the celebration of irresponsibility in the Domino's dinner table scene was agreeably edgy (I like the badass kids), and Ferrell's dad remains completely unredeemed and unredeemable to the end, which is a relief. But that Halliburton cameo leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and I could really live without the Smokey and the Bandit-style end credit bloopers, thematic relevance and all.",7,0,0,17 April 2008
