Alien 3," Alien3 and the gore
",I noticed something after I watched every alien movie including Alien vs. Predator the gore.Alien - not really that gory it generally used atmospheric music and parts were it would jump out at you or reveal itself slowly. Very effective Aliens - getting more intense gore wise human blood chest busters and alien blood and marines what a mixture Alien3- now this is were it peaked gore wise for me it was everywhere perfect blood smeared all over the alien and its slimy head and its teeth slimy red spit. After alien3 it seems the gore level went down what a shame.Alien resurrection - was just a shambles sure it had gore but it wasn't the same it didn't have the gritty feeling of the other three aliens.Alien vs. Predator - am still unsure about this movie something is missing maybe atmospheric music the fact it didn't get an 18 rating because they didn't put enough violence or gore in and am sure the ending could have been better and the predators sounded odd growling like a tiger aliens were OK but no real gore they made a joke out of the Alien and the Predator series I can only hope they wake up and if they do 'Alien vs. Predator 2' they make it gore filled violent and with character u can care about. It's strange its like alien3 was the peak of the gore in the Alien series that's why I love 'Alien 3' you cared about the prisoners even though they were murders and rapists and the best line in that movie 'FUCK' so many perfect death scenes with realistic amount of gore perfect.They need to take a page out of the book of alien three and place it into the alien and predator movies of the future character to care about gore and a perfect creature from hell.,10,1,6,27 June 2006
