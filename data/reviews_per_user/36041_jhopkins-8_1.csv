Lucky Number Slevin," Weak plot and characters
","I'm not really sure what all the hype is about this movie. Sure it has a fantastic cast, but everyone is phoning in their performances on a weak script and cashing their checks.The whole Boss/Rabbi feud isn't fully vested and it's explanation is weak. No one explains how they came into power in the first place, a nagging itch that's never scratched. The James Bond references were ridiculous and unnecessary. Lucy Liu seemed to think that talking fast is the same as actually acting out her part. The cop's involvement with the Boss and the Rabbi is never fleshed out either.Bottom line: this movie plays up the sadness and intensity in the beginning and expects us to get sucked into the revenge theme without giving us motive for anyone but Slevin. This feels like just the summary instead of an actual film.",3,14,35,19 April 2006
