The Devil's Advocate," Magnificent!
","This is one of the best films Keanu Reeves has ever been associated with, and one of Al Pacino's best roles ever. HollyWeird cranks out tons of suspense/horror films every year, but they only manage to produce a few memorable ones in any decade. This film is one of the latter and well worth the time it takes to view it.",10,0,0,7 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Few Saving Graces Is All It Took To Save This Film!
","Under normal circumstances I would rip this film apart bit by bit. But I won't! Why? Because I really liked it. To begin with the film had an above average cast - something the first three films lacked. Next of all, it had a really good script - albeit for children! That said, as an introduction to a much darker series it was a great hook, and though the films that followed were not on par with this one, they were not a complete disaster either. Personally, I loved everything from the amazing CGI scenery, the epic pod race, the fight scenes, and every costume that Princess Amidala wore. Yeah, I'm a huge Natalie Portman fan - sue me! Anyway, if I have one serious criticism of this film it would be with the acting of Jake Lloyd. But I've seen a lot worse - such as the now infamous role of Ham Solo (as played by Harrison Ford) in all of the first three Star Wars films. Sorry, Not A Fan! Anyway (2), if you're into really hard core Science Fiction then this may not be the film for you. But if you like a reasonably good film with minimal cheesy dialog and better than average acting then I'd recommend you take the time to watch it - if you have not done so already.",8,2,3,29 November 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," The Highest Rating I Would Give Any Star Wars Film!
","This is by far the best film in this franchise. I loved every minute of it. The plot was well thought out, the cast was pretty damn good, and they managed to keep the cheesy dialog to an absolute minimum. I don't do normal reviews where I go into long-winded reasons for why I liked a particular film, and i'm not going to do that with this one either. Sorry, I've nothing to SPOIL for you! While I'm sure there are many who did not like this film, I am not one of them. I gave it a 9 out of 10 Stars because I felt it was actually a Great Film, regardless of the horrific series that it's attached to. And yes, I own the lot, so I can say whatever I want to about them. So there! Anyway, if you have not seen this film I suggest you do. Just try to imagine that it's a stand alone film and that you've never heard of the other ones that gave rise to it. After all, imagination is what got us here in the first place! *** I'm still considering upgrading my rating of this film to a 10, so don't be surprised if I do!",9,8,10,29 November 2019
Captain Marvel," Divorce Court On The Horizon
","My wife loves these Marvel flicks, and I hate them. She forces me to watch them, and she won't even reciprocate by watching something good like The Good, The Bad, The Weird because the dialog is in Korean and she does not like subtitles. Anyway, after watching Iron Man (Okay, I'll admit I liked this one!) all the way through Civil War I figured I would choke this Sexual Appropriation Piece down and try to like it. Sorry folks, but this camp fest was everything that all of the Accurate and Believable reviewers said it was: Garbage. From the bad plot, to the typical CGI BS, to Miss Cow's Milk Cheese's robotic acting I could barely hold onto my dinner. I guess I picked a bad week to stop consuming barley sandwiches!
So, if this is the future of Holly Strange then you can leave me out of it.
It's not like I appreciate American made films all that much anyway. Let's be honest, the British have always made better films (Let's compare Blade to Underworld!!!). All I pray for now is that this type of disease does NOT swim across The Pond and infect the British film industry. Oh wait, what was that I heard about the next James Bond film?",1,4,14,3 November 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Why Are The Disney Films Always Bad ~ or ~ Was This An Off Day For Disney?
","This is still one of the best films I have ever seen. If only HollyWeird could manage to make more films this good. Yeah, fat chance! Anyway, beginning with a brilliant script, continuing with one of the best film casts ever, and ending with some of the best sets/costumes and directing this side of The Wizard Of Oz Disney managed to make movie history when the final editing of this film was completed. Unfortunately, I believe it went to their collective heads!. The good thing is they managed to release four more films that are almost its equal. Let's just hope they never reboot the series!",10,0,2,29 November 2019
Constantine," Almost Worthy Of 10 Stars!
","Based upon its subject matter Constantine is an exceptionally good film. I gave it a nine because I really enjoyed it. Sure, it has some flaws, but they were not enough to prevent me from purchasing the DVD, and when I do this I consider the film exceptionally good.",9,2,4,24 December 2019
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," All Too Short A Series!
","Great sequel to a great introductory film! Unfortunately the production company did not stick with this cast and make a third film. Instead, they made another Flop Reboot with a different cast. Typical HollyWeird . . . they never know when they've done something right, because it's all too infrequent. As for this film, I would highly recommend it to anyone because it's one of the best superhero movies ever made!",10,0,1,4 December 2019
Silent Hill," The First Hour Of This Film Is Incredible . . . Then . . !
","It's a real shame the production company that made this film did not delete the latter half of the shooting script and send it out for a complete re-write. Had they done so it would have been a far better film. I still purchased a copy of Silent Hill on DVD due to the brilliance of the fist half, but I really believe the overall result to be one of the biggest disappointments in horror movie history - due mostly to the horrific ending. And who really cares if the script followed the plot of the video game! HollyWeird directors are famous for making serious alterations to great stories. So they should have made alterations to this one in order to make it a truly great film. Unfortunately they failed to do so.",7,1,2,19 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," I'm Getting A Rise Out Of Rating This Film!
","Definitely not worth the time it takes to watch it! This film was nothing but a Pile Of Rancid Tripe! They should have banned the whole film in Singapore, and I hope if and when anyone associated with the film's production or cast goes there they get canned! That said, I really hope this Failed Franchise (That made lots of money) is finally put to rest. Yeah! 42 years of trying, and the only really good film in the entire lot is Rogue One - and nearly all of the Star Bores Purists hate it! Never have so few done so much to destroy a potentially great series with every mistake they could make. And who told Adam Driver that he could act? Jesus H. Vader is he ever terrible!",1,19,32,24 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Natalie!
","That's right, the only thing about this film worth my time watching it was Natalie Portman! Oh, and the Jedi/Sith duel at the end was pretty good also!",8,2,5,24 December 2019
Predator," Cheesey Dialoge And Bad Acting Destroy Great Concept!
","This is one of the worst films ever made! I realize I'm probably in the minority here, but when I watch a film I want to hear good dialogue, not cheesy schlock. And when the subject is grim I don't want the story to digress to a comedic level. Yeah, I know muscle man Arnold was popular at the time, but he could not act his way through a sheet of thin plastic, and neither could any of the rest of these clowns. And what the Hell is with the dude with the huge glasses? Is this a combat team or what? The only thing this film is good for is exhibiting to the world how Hollyweird manages to take great concepts and turn them into immemorable celluloid crap! But I guess you have to have the mind of a ten year old boy to not see how bad this film actually was and is.",1,0,11,28 April 2020
The Matrix Revolutions," Every Series Has To Have A Conclusion . . .
",". . . fortunately this series concluded. Yeah, I enjoyed watching the series. But by the time it was over I realized that it was not as good as the hype, and that I have seen much better films. Other than Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne, I won't miss any of this incredibly DieVerse cast. And though I kind of liked Agent Smith, I won't miss Hugo Weaving at all. Nor will I miss Carrie-Anne Moss!",4,0,0,28 April 2020
The Usual Suspects," Nothing New, But Incredibly Good Old School Hollywood Theatrics
","Great acting, great directing, and exceptional dialog are usually what makes a great film. And while The Usual Suspects is nothing more than a rehash of numerous older films pasted together to spin its tale the end result turns out to be exceptionally good. Bravo!",10,1,2,25 December 2019
Alien vs. Predator," Not Great, But Not Terrible Either!
","So far, the Alien/Predator Franchises has produced four films that I have rated great or good, and this is one of them. Personally, though I loved the concept of Predator, I hated the film. The acting was low-grade, the dialogue was trite and cheesy, and the script was formulaic at best. But if Predator was a popular dud, then Predator 2 was one of the worst films ever made. That said, I did like Predators, though it was far from perfect. OK, onto the Alien franchise! I found Alien to be the best of the lot, and then Alien 3. Whereas Aliens was destroyed by the bad dialogue and dismal acting by Bill Paxton, et al. And Alien Resurrection was just an insult that should not have been made at all. But you would have to read my brief review on that. So this should give you some idea of what I was looking for when I watched this film. Personally, when I'm watching a grim, dark movie I want it to remain grim and dark - like the Underworld series and not like Blade! Keeping this in mind, AVP never strays into Comedy, and its dialogue is reasonably logical for the situation, and the acting is fairly good. And the story is above average and somewhat plausible. This does not mean that I could not find bits and pieces of AVP to pick apart, but it certainly is not as bad as Predator, Predator 2, Aliens, Alien Resurrection, and its sequel AVP Requiem. I haven't even bothered to watch the latest Predator release, and I never will. Unfortunately, the makers of this film left us with a lone heroine stranded in a very cold and hostile environment (Like the Predators could not have offered her a lift to somewhere warmer instead of giving her a useless trophy!), and a pointless, meaningless summation. Other than that, AVP is still one of the better films of any of these two series - and that says a lot about how bad the other ones are!",8,1,1,28 April 2020
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Great Film Despite The Changes!
","I enjoyed every minute of this rendition. I don't know what Purists are expecting, but I'm here to tell them that no one is ever going to make and release an exact replica of the book on film!",10,0,0,15 April 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Another Horrific HollyWeird Pile Of Tripe
","Yet another disastrous HollyWeird cliche starring Leonardo DeCrapio! When are the people in charge of making movies in Tinsel Town going to realize that most of the doofs they hire are more annoying than they are entertaining? And if it's not bad enough that they keep hiring clowns like this to be in their films, they keep writing lousy, unimaginative scripts, and peppering them with cheesy dialog. I'm so glad that the British film industry still manages to make good films . . . but then, they don't have a stable full of 7th rate thespians like Leo that they're in love with. Enough said!",1,3,10,5 December 2019
Hellboy," Never Read The Comic Because Comics Are For Kids!
","Great film! I own a copy of this and the sequel, and I would highly recommend them both to anyone. That's my review!",10,1,4,2 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Why Are The Disney Films Always Crappy? ~ or ~ They Should Have Driven Adam Off A Cliff
","Everything that is wrong with this film in one paragraph. The plot, the script, the story, the majority of the characters, and, MOST Of ALL, Adam Driver! Why in Palpatine's name did they cast this doorknob in this film? I'm not going to say another word!",1,17,27,29 November 2019
8 Mile," Low Grade Garbage
","Where's the entertainment? I know, they left it out on purpose in order to be original. Perhaps they should have found someone who could act and written a good script before filming began. It's tripe, don't waste your time!",1,0,2,16 June 2020
Paranormal Activity," Was This Intended To Be A Comedy?
","This is without a doubt the WORST horror/spook/creep/ghost story/film EVER! I played with my Ouija board for three hours in the dark before watching this low grade tripe, and not one hair on the back of my neck raised. No, I would not recommend this $chlock to anyone!",1,2,4,24 December 2019
The Adjustment Bureau," Great Film!
","This is a truly likeable film with truly likeable characters. The pace is quick, the plotting is relatively easy to follow, and the acting and dialog are above average. All of this equates to a really memorable film. Of course, you will have to open your mind to the Love Story aspects of the film, but it's one of the better films of this genre since Sleepless In Seattle - for those who appreciated this particular classic!",10,0,1,12 February 2020
2001: A Space Odyssey," Boring!
",Short of a few humorous moments this is one of the most boring and overrated films ever made! Why anyone in this era would recommend it is beyond me?,2,2,6,12 February 2020
Avatar," Boring, Long-Winded, Formulaic Rip Off Of Ferngully!
","I've seen this film once, and that says everything about how much I hated it. I own copies of films that I've given 1 Star Reviews of here, but I wouldn't accept a free copy of this flick as a Christmas present. Sorry, folks, but it's just Big Budget, Highly Overrated $Schlock with some of the Worst Acting I have ever subjected myself to viewing. This flick makes the entire trio of the last Star Wars sagas a 12.5 by comparison, and I haven't rated any of them above a 1 Star!",1,6,15,1 December 2019
A Clockwork Orange," Sleazy Horror Schlock!
","This film is the result of the era in which it was filmed. Today, I doubt it could be filmed. In any case, as bad Cinematic Art goes this movie is as bad as it gets. We begin with a terrible script, taken from a lousy novel, and add some of the worst acting this side of The Brady Bunch. The only reason it's popular is because of the blatant exploitation of rape and other sexual violence. So I imagine that says a great deal about our society. To top things off, the movie is about 30 minutes longer than it should have been, because there came a point where it was obvious that the story ended, but the director decided to continue filming anyway. Why is the only question?",1,1,10,10 February 2020
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A Timeless Classic That Has Become Movie History
","Thank God this film (and the series) was made by a British production company and not by the idiots who run Hollyweird! I don't feel any compulsion towards reviewing this film because it is celluloid perfection in every imaginable aspect. The cast was perfect, the sets were perfect, and the dialog was perfect. If you disagree then read the book and continue on with being a purist. I won't care!",10,2,3,1 December 2019
The Matrix Reloaded," Too Much Chop Socky, Too Much DieVersity, But lots Of Great CGI!
","I really liked this film and its predecessor a lot more the first time I watched them, but time and my overall opinion of Hollyweird has changed a great deal since then. The best part about this film and series is its originality and unique CGI effects. But other than Laurence Fishburne's acting, most of the performances are abysmal to downright horrid - including that done by Keanu. The saving grace is that the dialogue was quite good, so it elevated the performances considerably. Other than that, I have little to say about this film, mostly because I would rather rate it as part of the series it belongs to rather than as a stand-alone film.",6,0,0,28 April 2020
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," 50/50 My Sister, My Mother, My Sister, My Mother!
","Half of me wanted to vomit watching this $chlock Fest, knowing full well that it was made specifically to appease the wallets of all those involved in the making of it. While, the other half of me really enjoyed it for what it is. It was the latter half that won out and bought the DVD Box Set. Sure, the movie strayed Extremely Far from the book. Oh well - this is what film makers do: They take great art and then ruin it by quickly whitewashing over the canvas with a really stiff brush. I've grown accustomed to this because it's been occurring my entire life, and such is never going to change. Therefore, one may as well accept what is and try to make the most of it! As movies go, this one was Incredible. Other than that, the script should be burned and rewritten in order to make the movie identical to the book. Fat chance!",5,1,4,26 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Revenge Of The Production Company! ~ Or ~ Revenge Of Another Bad Script
","We began with a script written for children in The Phantom Menace, and we ended up with a script written for adults by the time Attack Of The Clones came along. Lucas buggered this series up, but it is heads and tails better than the first and the most recent installments. That said, even the presence of Natalie Portman could not save Revenge Of The Sith. When will the casting directors in Hollyweird figure out how to cast a film? At the time I didn't think they could ever find anyone worse than Hayden Christensen to play an evil character like Darth Vader - but then they found Adam Driver (A Low Grade Soap Opera Actor At Best). Even so, some of the action scenes in this film were incredible, but great CGI does not a great movie make!",1,1,12,24 December 2019
Prometheus," Another Fassbender Fast Track To Movie Destruction!
","The inclusion of Michael Fassbender is what Killed this film, but the idiots who made it earned enough $cholck Dollars that they don't care. This Horrific POS is just another example of why HollyWeird should stop attempting to make movies! It's really sad that such a great idea has been repeatedly turned into a pile of celluloid trash. And I really don't care if anyone finds this review helpful!",1,1,11,22 November 2019
Casino Royale," Dark, For Dark Business
","Daniel Craig is the best James Bond yet, and his grim visage and No-BS delivery has helped to move the Bond series beyond its suave and dapper roots to what it was always meant to be: a D A R K compilation of stories about a cold blooded killer! However, if you prefer your James Bond with a lot less reality, a lot more humour, and a bigger smile then don't put this one on your watch list because you may be very disappointed.",10,3,7,7 December 2019
Midway," Another Poor Retelling Of History or Another Insult To The Brave Men And Women Who Died During This Era
","I should not add any justification to this $chlock's existence, but since Hollyweird created it I feel compelled, so here goes. I don't know when the producers, directors, screen geniuses in Tarnished Tinsel Town are going to figure out that they have no talent whatsoever for historical dramas of this nature, but I hope it occurs in the next 1,000 year or so. Anyway, this film is everything I expected: Typical, Boring, Lame, Formulaic Tripe . . . and the cast, the plotting, and the dialogue can only be described as Terrible. But hey, what do I know? People are bored, and $chlock sells. Bottom line: You'd be better off watching one of the YouBoob video documentaries on this event and spending the money on lottery tickets!",1,33,107,7 November 2019
The Matrix," Incredibly Original For Its Time, And Still Damn Good!
","With the exception of the gratuitous DieVersity, and the FACT that all of the Evil Agents are played by White Males, The Matrix (and its sequels) is actually very good. I would even say that it is everything Star Wars, Aliens, Predator, Blade, and a host of other film franchises could have been had they kept the cheesy dialog to an absolute minimum, and hired some relatively competent actors. The best part of the Matrix is Keanu and his sleep-walk style of good bad-method acting. Had the production company selected anyone else this franchise would have been DOA! Even so, there are flaws in this film (and its sequels), some minor inconsistencies, and things that just make no sense at all - even considering the environment. Yet, despite its negatives, this film and the sequels are heads and tails better than nearly all of the cheesy $chlock that Hollyweird has foisted off on us before or since. Chances are you will like this film (this series) a whole lot, but if you do not, you should probably admit that science fiction is not your thing and return to watching low budget comedies, starring former SNL cast members!",8,2,2,24 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Me In 1977: Yay! Me in 2019: I Don't Think So!
","So what changed? Why did I go from loving this film to nearly practically hating it? Time is the only answer I can offer as an answer to this question. I guess you had to see it the weekend of its initial release and compare it to the Horrific HollyWeird $chlock that passed for film entertainment in those days. In 1977 this film was a 10 because it was the most original idea of its kind since the beginning of film history - bar none! But 43 years has passed and I've fell out of love with lousy acting and cheesy dialog. Or, I guess I've fallen in love with great acting and acceptable to exceptional dialog - neither of which this film has. And that's why I have given it a 3 Star rating. As science fiction films go, Star Wars will always be the most inventive and the most unique, but since I've had 43 years to watch a number of truly great films in this genre I have to be honest about my opinion of it. So far I've watched Rogue One about fifty or more times, and I'm pretty sure I've seen this overrated bit of film history about half a dozen. Long Ago, In A DVD Case Somewhere In My TV Room . . . and there it shall remain - along with the other titles in this tired saga!",3,2,11,29 November 2019
Alien: Covenant," And I Was Stupid Enough To Buy The DVD!
","Yeah, I have the whole collection, and for this reason alone I believe I'm qualified to review this POS. I'll make this review brief: If you're the type of Alien fan (Like Me) who will watch any of the $chlock that the Idiots who own the rights to this franchise then give this film a watch. But don't expect much from it. The plot is probably the worst of the series so far, and that's saying a lot because the creators of this entire franchise have only managed to make 1 (ONE) good film, and that was the first. For some reason, the Directors/Producers have been Hell Bent on destroying these films with terrible plotting and cheesy dialog. And in this last installment they found the worst cast (Beginning with Michael Fassbender) that they could find. It's a shame the production company who made Underworld was not in charge of the Aliens series, because Hollywood has EFFED them up good, and you have to be a real fan of the character itself in order to stomach them!",1,5,10,22 November 2019
The Wizard of Oz," The Best Movie Ever Made!
","I've seen this film over 100 times, and I've enjoyed it every time. Fortunately I now own the remastered/restored version - which is considerably better than the original VHS release. Anyway, I'm not going to go into any further details because . . . why should I? That's my opinion, and that's my review!",10,1,2,16 February 2020
