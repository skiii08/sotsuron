The Godfather: Part II," excellent sequel
","the godfather part 2 is more of a continuation then a sequel.its also a prequel,showing flashbacks of Vito corleone as a youth,and later as a young man played by Robert DE niro.there's more murder and mayhem.AL pacino takes over as boss of the family,as mob movies go this and the godfather 1 are the best,Mario puzo wrote the story as well as the screenplay.the performances by pacino,Talia shire,Robert duvall,Robert DE niro,Diane Keaton are excellent,look for roger corman playing a small part towards the ending.the connection here is that roger corman gave Francis ford Coppola his first job at directing with the film dementia 13,a black and white horror film.godfather 2 also stars john cazale and lee strasberg.this is a highly recommended film,it must be seen uncensored to be really appreciated.10 out of 10.excellent sequel.",10,1,2,30 July 2006
The Exorcist," scariest movie of the 1970's
","The first time iv'e seen the exorcist it scared me so bad i had nightmares for days,and that was in the mid 80's,during its re-release its a modern horror film depicting the possession of an average good natured 12 year old(Linda Blair)but when demons begin to possess her all chaos breaks loose,this was done before cg effects came out.the movie seemed cursed,a few people died during filming like jack McGowan and some crew members.in the new version with the added scenes there's a lot of footage not shown in the 1973 release.the cast is great,Linda Blair delivers an awesome performance as Reagan,the little girl possessed.max Von sydow as father merrin,Ellen burnsyn as Reagan's actress mother, Jason miller as the troubled catholic priest.and lee j Cobb as the inspector on the case.no movie ever topped or even matched this,many movies like;beyond the door,abbey,and the tempter all tried but failed.the sequels never lived up to the original.fact Linda Blair injured her back during filming.the spooky music on the soundtrack is very memorable,the exorcist is the scariest movie from the 70's. it needs to be viewed in its uncensored version to be appreciated. there's a lot of strong language and violence.max Von sydow,Linda Blair and kitty Wynn reprised their roles in the first sequel called the heretic exorcist 2,which was pointless,the third one was OK,the latest one was a prequel and was'nt good in my opinion.the exorcist is a horror movie one does'nt forget,a true classic.10 out of 10.",10,2,3,28 July 2006
The Evil Dead," Tennessee scaries
","When i first seen the evil dead it was so scary it rivaled the exorcist, it was released by new line cinema back in 1982.it was a fresher approach to horror then Friday the 13th and Halloween.it has humor and thrills,and gallons of blood and gore,it made Bruce Campbell(ash)a star and was followed by 2 sequels.the budget was low but the movie doesn't show it,there's a lot of nail biting suspense.Sam raimi's first film he went on to direct dark man,and spider man 1 and 2,and upcoming spider man 3.watch this at night with the lights out and you will jump, this is a shocker and a cult classic,like Texas chainsaw massacre. Sam raimis brother Ted makes a cameo,and so does Sam raimis old car,a an Oldsmobile delta 88 that was seen in raimis other film;spider man. if you are a fan of good horror don't miss this,10 out of 10.",10,0,2,3 August 2006
Rocky," The Italian Stalion
","in 1976 the movie rocky came out,it was a sleeper hit and it made Sylvester Stallone a big star.the story is fairly simple,a down and out boxer is picked to do an exhibition bought with the champion Apollo creed (carl weathers)and he trains with his gruff manager(burgess Meredith) who is an ex fighter.falls in love with a very shy girl(Talia shire) and deals with his obnoxious friend(Burt young)anyway rocky's side job is a collector for a loan shark(Joe spinell)the boxing scenes are real intense,Stallone did all the stunts himself.stunts? well the boxing. rocky spawned several sequels,some pretty good,the last one,rocky 5 was'nt all that good.the much anticipated rocky 6 will be released around Christmas 2006.look for troma films producer Lloyd Kaufman (aka;samuel well)as a drunk in the local bar in Philadelphia.rocky is a great movie,even if you don't like boxing.directer;John D Avildsen went on to direct;the karate kid in 1984 with Ralph Macchio.i give rocky 10 out of 10,its a great movie.",10,0,0,19 August 2006
Jaws," Great White Terror!!!
","In the summer of 1975 i stood on line to see one of the scariest movies of all time,not as scary as the exorcist but at the time it was scary. this early Steven Spielberg movie made people afraid of the water,like psycho made people afraid of run down motel showers.this is an action adventure thriller.a huge shark terrorizes swimmers and its up to police chief martin Brody(Roy sheider)and oceanographer Matt hooper (richard Dreyfus)to stop it with the help of Ahab like shark hunter; quint(Robert shaw)who's very good at what he does.the shark is shown briefly but very effectively.the sequels were OK to lame.jaws 2 was good but the other two not so.the book is more terrifying.but if you were to watch this for the first time,it'll make you afraid of going swimming in the ocean.I'm hoping that they don't remake this one,you cant improve on perfection.10 out of 10.highly recommended.",10,1,2,16 July 2006
Halloween," the bogeyman cometh
","John carpenters groundbreaking sleeper hit,belongs in the hall of fame of monsters and supernatural killers.it was made with a mere $300.000 i believe.and served as the debut of Jamie lee Curtis who became the scream queen of the 1980's.after this was released a whole bunch of horror films came out,in 1981 they came out of the woodwork.Friday the 13th,terror train,etc;but this was the best.also co stars horror movie legend Donald pleasense,who was around for most of the sequels.there's a lot of suspense,and chills.a perfect movie to watch Halloween night. heres some trivia that most people know,the mask worn by the killer was a repainted William shatner as captain kirk mask.john carpenter made a few hits after this but not as good as Halloween,the second one is heavy on gore,to satisfy the Friday the 13th fans.the 3rd one had nothing to do with the first 2.micheal myers is like a mime from hell. the soundtrack is as memorable as the music from jaws.Jamie lee Curtis along with a few cast members from Halloween starred in the next john carpenter classic;the fog.which was recently remade in 2005.10 out of 10.a classic suspense horror from 1978,not to be missed.check it out.",10,0,1,18 July 2006

","Wes Craven's infamous shocker about a horribly scarred dead killer that attacks teens in their dreams.if they die in the dream they really die. when i saw this for the first time it scared the hell out of me.it was very original and much better then most of the slasher films of the 1980's.robert englund plays Freddy Krueger,a role he became famous for. englund is no stranger to horror movies he played Willy the good alien on the TV mini series v,and in roger cormans;galaxy of terror.the other actors are ronee Blakeley(Nashville)heather langenkamp,john Saxon(blood beach)and the movie debut of johnny depp.this began the nightmare franchise and even a short lived TV series hosted by Freddy called; Freddy's nightmares.which was a lot like the twilight zone and night gallery.the movie was so successful there were several sequels,including a team up with Jason voorhees from Friday the 13th. Wes craven's first hit after the hills have eyes in 1977.craven's other big films were;last house on the left,and the scream trilogy.Fred Krueger became the first new movie monster following Frankensteins monster,Dracula,the mummy,and the wolf man.johnny depp returned for a cameo in Freddy's dead the final nightmare.you cant keep a good bogeyman down.this classic gets 10 out of 10 easy.one two Freddy's coming for you. turn out the lights,pop some popcorn,lock your doors and watch nightmare on elm street.",10,0,0,13 October 2006
