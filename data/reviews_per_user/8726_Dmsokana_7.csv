Mission: Impossible III," Ethan Hunt is back and better than ever
","I saw this movie last night and I have to say I am very impressed. The action was incredibly, the story line works very well and the cast wasn't to bad. I didn't really care for the first two Mission Impossibles. The first was OK but the second one was not that good. Mission Impossible 3 is amazing and you will be hooked for two hours and 5 minutes. There are so many twists and turns towards the end its very crazy. Overall I recommend you see this movie. In my opinion its the best one so far. I will definitely buy this movie when it comes out on DVD. Ethan Hunt is back and better than every Go see it!!!! Awesome movie!!!",8,5,8,6 May 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," I expect more out of this movie.
","I saw this movie last night and I was a little disappointed. The movie is about Josh Harnett who everyone believes his Nick Fisher. Nick Fisher is a man who owes a lot of money to Morgan Freeman and The Rabi played by Ben Kingsley. Bruce Willis is the hit-man in the movie. Lucy Liu is the girl next door who Josh Harnett falls in love with. I been waiting for this movie to come out in theaters for a while I the waiting wasn't worth it. I thought this movie would be like the classics pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown but I was wrong. The movie didn't suck it was funny some parts, had a little action, but it was missing something. I do have to say the ending is amazing and will blow you away. The ending is amazing and it makes the movie a little better. Overall I give this movie 5 out of 10 stars, would I recommend it to others, maybe if your bored or just want to relax a see an average movie.",5,9,22,20 April 2006
LÃ©on: The Professional," Wow
","I first saw this movie when I was about 10 and it blew me away. The movie is about Natalie Portman who's parents are deadbeats. Natalie Portman is a young girl who sees her parents killed by Gary Oldman. She is hiding under the bed when her mom, dad, and little brother are killed. They think that they have killed everyone in the family but they are wrong. Natalie Portman survives and wants revenge. She starts staying with Jean Reno who is a hit man. She wants to learn everything so she can get revenge on the death of her family. This is an amazing movie and Natalie Portman is sensational. This movie deserves 10 out of 10 stars. The cast is perfect and so is this movie.",10,0,4,30 April 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," An average movie
","First and foremost this was the worst Xmen of the trilogy. The first one was amazing. The second one was great. The third wasn't bad by any means but it was just average. Its hard to compare this movie to the others because they were so perfect. The movie has actions, most of the cast is back except the night crawler. In this movie there is a cure for the mutants which was very interesting to see who wanted the sure. I did like the movie I just expected a lot more. Well if you seen the first two you have to see this one but its gonna blow you away like the first two. Check it out 6 out of 10 stars",6,0,1,25 May 2006

The Holiday," Awesome Romantic movie
","This movie is hilarious and the cast is amazing. This movie is about Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz who both have just got out of long term relationships and decide to switch places. Cameron Diaz decides to live where Kate Winslet is and Kate WInslet movies to LA where Cameron lives. The reason this movie works is the chemistry with all four characters. Jack Black is hilarious and I like his character in this movie, much better than Nacho Libre. Cameron Diaz is beautiful as always and her romantic chemistry with Jude Law works.Go see this movie its funny, great cast, and has everything you need in a movie.",9,0,1,31 March 2007
V for Vendetta," Finally a great movie
","I saw this movie about a month ago and I have to saw its amazing. Natalie Portman is excellent in this movie and the she brings the film to live. The action in this movie is fantastic and will live you wanting more. Natalie portman plays Evey who's parents were murdered when she was a kid. She works at a news broadcasting studio and one night she gets attacked by some men. To her rescue comes V a man who wears a mask and rescues her from being raped. The movie starts here and only gets better. The plot is about a man V who wants revenge on everyone who hurt him years ago. Natalie Portman is such a good actress and this movie shows it. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see something clever, witty and just a great film.",9,1,3,30 April 2006
