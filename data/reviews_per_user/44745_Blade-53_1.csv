Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," One of the Best movies I've seen
",George Lucas truly outdid himself with this film special effects wise anyway. The story was true to Star Wars form keeping the tradition of the original three while adding the special effects which made it a great movie. I also have to give Mr. Lucas credit for the actors and actresses he choose for the movie Liam Neilson was great as the semi-rebel Jedi who always argued against the council rules and Ewan Mcgregor was the perfect choice for Obi-Wan. I don't know how Mr.Lucas found such a perfect kid to play Anakin but it will be interesting to see how he turns such an angelic boy to the dark side.  My favorite character has to be Darth Maul though he is the best bad guy I've seen in years and he fights as a Sith apprentice should His weapon is just incredible and the way he moves so gracefully is amazing. Some people may say they were disappointed I cannot see how maybe your expectations were too high? The only downfall was the annoying alien Bin he should have had a smaller role(he is no Chewbacca) but he was funny in some instances.  My thanks to George Lucas for continuing the Legend with such style I for one cannot wait for the next installation.,Null,1,1,19 May 1999
