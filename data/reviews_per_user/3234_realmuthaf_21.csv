The Equalizer," Denzel still delivers.
","While not being somewhat outstanding, The Equalizer is still a potent, albeit a bit too slow-paced, action movie. The plot, obviously, is not very original, so the main question was how good it would be executed.The result is mostly satisfying, among the strong sides I'd name: of course Denzel Washington, who never disappoints (although his other movies I've seen were better), gory action and the overall classic action movie feel to it - the hero is super bad-ass, always walking slowly, dispensing kickassery and not looking at explosions, while the villain is properly menacing and ruthless. The movie's not without flaws, and shaky camera work during action scenes, overly slow pacing and the stereotypical bad guys are among them. (Russian gangsters with cheesy tattoos, lots of vodka and tons of Kremlin and Red Square pictures) Despite that, the movie manages to hold its own and be worth your time and money. It's quite refreshing to watch an old-school bad- ass-distributing-justice movie after all those comic book adaptations and the rule 'Denzel doesn't play in bad movies' still works.",7,2,9,26 September 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Episode 6/10
","'Hey, I'm blind, am not a Force user and only got a bloody wooden stick, but I will take down tons of trained soldiers.''I need to shoot the chief scientist, I got him AND an important imperial officer dressed in white in my sights for approx. 1 minute, but I won't shoot anybody cos morals.'<ul><li>'Sir, the plans for the Death Star are being stolen from a facility that also contains hundreds of other valuable projects.' - 'K. Destroy the whole facility, but don't shoot right at it, but a bit to the side, so the rebels have enough time to send the plans and hold hands on the beach.'</li></ul>'Hi I'm the New Expendable Villain and I've got you on gunpoint, Bland Poorly-Acted Female Protagonist, but I refuse to shoot you in favor of a cliché monologue leading to my demise.'That about sums up the integrity and plot complexity of Rogue One, the adaptation of the opening crawl of Episode IV. It does have some kinda cool battle scenes, an amusing robot and 30 seconds of Darth Vader killing people, but the rest is predictable fellat... I mean, homage to the old trilogy, which apparently is enough to make people salivate and cheer.Meanwhile I think that when in an ensemble movie you only care about the ROBOT character and when in a movie that 'is different from the main episodes and does not concentrate on Jedi' half the runtime is dedicated to various fan service and recognizable elements, and the coolest scene, surprise, features Jedi, it's just not a good movie.So, 6/10 tops, the more I scrutinize this film the worse my score gets, so I'd better stop here. It's kind of sad that in order to make a financially successful movie you need this little.",6,3,8,29 December 2016
Deadpool 2," A sequel as it should be
","Finally, after all the underwhelming repetitive single-use superhero flicks Deadpool returns to save the day.Deadpool 2 is the exemplary sequel - it just takes all the original's ingredients and carefully improves upon them.The first movie felt a bit confined with just a couple of locations due to its low budget - this one feels like a proper blockbuster. The first had modest action - here the amount, scale and choreography (thanks to director Devit Leitch) of fight scenes is heightened noticeably. The situation with jokes here is on par with the original - there are a lot of them, some don't work, but many do and the overall impression is very much favorable, there are plenty of laughs to be had here. The sheer number of characters involved is also increased, which does leave some with little screen time, like Negasonic Warhead.Had it not been for the stretched-out ending and a few story hiccups, this might've even been a 10/10 contender. While WB keep wasting their comic universe's potential and Disney keeps spitting out generic junk of descending quality, Deadpool 2 manages to be as good as its predecessor and set directly set things up for sequels. And I say, keep them coming.",9,3,6,20 May 2018
Suicide Squad," Stale Squad
","When I saw the first teaser-trailer and promo images for this movie, I was largely unimpressed. As the marketing campaign unfolded, though, Suicide Squad managed to create some serious hype that I found myself unable not to join. The result, however, is mixed, for the trailers advertise another, better, funkier and more audacious kind of movie.Story-wise, things are very simple and bland here - first we get around half an hour worth of character introduction (understandable, since there are so many of them), which goes at a rapid pace and with lots of different licensed background music, almost like an advertisement or a music video. Then, with everyone onboard, the Squad arrives to some city devastated by a colorful CG Aztec-looking big dude. What happens next is some of the more disappointingly stale stuff: instead of an explosive chemistry and wit-filled spectacle we get some uninventive action scenes involving shooting and beating lots of mindless drones (a-la Avengers 1&2), the supposedly 'bad to the bone' protagonists implausibly bonding and becoming friends (they say that they're friends now, like, 5 times) and overcoming a lame bland CG-villain (who, despite all his powers and menacing looks goes down from a regular medium-sized bomb, yeah).Now the simplistic plot could have been saved by character interactions, but that doesn't really happen here. I'll just go ahead and list all the members with brief descriptions:Deadshot - Will Smith playing Will Smith. Nothing new, but it turns out I still like that guy.Harley - Margot Robbie is pretty and has a fine butt, but all the quirks and grimaces and the overall childlike demeanor at times feels out of place.Joker - This is a definite miss for me. Leto is overacting hard and is bringing nothing new to the table - he is just a mob boss who has a tendency towards ridiculousness.El Diablo - Surprisingly robust. The drama in his backstory didn't work for me, but overall he is fairly charismatic.Boomerang - Jai Courtney does not annoy the hell out of me in this movie, so that's some progress. Other than that, his presence is minimal and he mostly serves as a semi-successful comedic relief.Enchantress - From what I gather, Cara Delevigne is only somewhat famous because of her wealthy parents. Let's just say I wish this was not the case.Rick Flag and Amanda Waller - they play their respective parts well. Can't really add much.Killer Croc - He's alright, but I've got a feeling that nothing would've changed if he was not in this movie altogether.Katana - Read the paragraph above.Slipknot - Who?So, some of the chemistry between characters works, some of it doesn't. All of the drama in this movie is unconvincing and redundant. The Justice League cameos are pretty cool. The heavily-promoted soundtrack is underused, with the best songs just playing during the credits or muffled in the background (yeah, Purple Lamborghini).Overall I can't say it's a bad movie, but it's not a good one, either. It's just a tad bit above average, and it is sad, as this is yet another missed opportunity for the DCEU to get a solid hit on their hands.",6,16,35,4 August 2016
The Revenant," Very good, but not Oscar-worthy
","After last year's astounding Birdman, which came to be one of my favourite movies of all time, I was looking forward to A. Iñárritu's new collaboration with the cinematographer E. Lubezki. And sadly, it fell a bit short of my exaggerated expectations.From the standpoint of cinematography, Revenant is expectedly gorgeous. Beautiful environments (shot with natural lighting!), gritty realism of the depicted situations, scenes shot from unusual perspectives - everything is as close to perfection as possible.However, as for the movie's plot and themes, everything turned out to be disappointingly straightforward. It's just a revenge tale. No subtle nuances, no amendments to the classic conception. Besides, I'd say it has some issues with the motivation of the Indian tribe that's hunting the protagonists for a good part of the movie. What is more, while the overall pacing is good for a 2,5+ hours-long movie, it does drop after the first hour noticeably only to pick up around half an hour later.As for acting, everything is done professionally - both the lead and secondary role actors perform admirably, but as for DiCaprio, I honestly think he's had stronger and more interesting roles than having to growl, squirm, crawl and breath heavily for two and a half hours straight.In the end, it's a wonderfully acted, breathtakingly filmed, meticulously polished classic tale about a man overcoming all obstacles imaginable to revenge the death of his loved ones, with no twists or additions plot-wise. Is it a good movie? Yes, definitely, very much so. But is it Oscar-worthy? We will find out this February, but I personally wouldn't say so.",8,1,4,15 January 2016
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Puts the 'Amazing' back into 'Spider-Man'
","I didn't quite expect this level of good when going to the cinema - Into The Spider-Verse ended up delivering on pretty much everything.The jokes are actually funny - no underage cringy garbage shoehorned by Disney into their movies. Special thanks to Nicholas 'Noir' Cage. The visual style is astonishing, pays close homage to the comics, but still looks distinct and aesthetically pleasing. The drama here surprisingly works, and some moments in this movie are very far from being childish. Of course the Spider-Verse also has a ton of references to everything from the Raimi trilogy to the recent PS4 game, and they're also great, make sure to stay for the after-credits scene. Even the protagonist Morales also works, as opposed to the aforementioned PS4 game, where he was kind of dull.So yeah, miles (no pun intended) ahead of the MCU and of Sony's own previous live-action attempts, Into The Spider-Verse is a great animated movie, totally looking forward to the announced spin-off and sequel.",9,7,17,16 December 2018
Dunkirk," Chris Nolan's expensive WW2 playground
","Christopher Nolan is no original choice when it comes to picking favorite directors, and I'm no non-conformist in this sense, I liked very much every movie of his that I've watched so far. And while I can't say I dislike this either, I believe that Dunkirk is his inferior work.From the technical standpoint, of course, everything is beautiful, with Warner Bros. basically letting Nolan make a small World War 2 of his own with real boats and planes and over a thousand extras. There's also an interesting gimmick with three timelines of different length being shown at the same time, as the events happening on the beach lasted a week, on the sea - a day, in the skies - an hour. It's still a gimmick, but a fairly interesting one, and if not for it, I'm afraid the movie would've been way too boring.The problem is that Dunkirk failed to resonate with me in almost any way. I've read people say that the film is devoid of emotion, but I don't think it's exactly a problem here - an idea to make a war movie just about survival isn't a flawed one, we've had plenty of movies over-glorifying soldiers in the past. But still, my impression of the film was very superficial and started to immediately wither away even as I was walking out of the theater. The director obviously wanted to generate and hold suspense for the majority of the movie, but I thought that it didn't work, even though there were a few tense moments.Two additional minor nitpicks are that the PG-13 rating shows more in a war film, especially after the recent Hacksaw Ridge, and that it looked pretty weird that there were only three Spitfires on the British side and a dozen of planes on the German side. As Wikipedia tells us, the airborne casualties of both sides were over a hundred planes each and while I get that Nolan couldn't get himself a whole working fleet of planes, their small number still looked off.Another thing I've heard people praise is the soundtrack. Here Hans Zimmer thought that if he's a renowned composer unanimously praised by viewers and critics alike, he might as well just record a clock ticking and add some random drums to it and still get away with it. And alas! He succeeded. Waiting for him to record the sound of himself burping with drums and loud noises in the background and still being praised for the next movie.So yeah, Dunkirk looks good and is loud, but that's about it, unfortunately. I would say that Mr. Nolan in general is not overrated, but this particular movie of his just might be.",7,2,6,2 August 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," Infinite Mediocrity
","Infinity War is the same predictable mediocre flick for children as usual, only one that's too big for its own good.The previous team-up movies had a generic structure: some unmenacing bad guy arrives so the heroes have to unite - the heroes do unite, but the bad guy seems to take the upper hand - the heroes regroup and defeat the bad guy. Since IW was planned as two movies (more movies = more cash, not like there's some story to be told here), the structure is split between them, so the first one ends with the heroes seemingly defeated. But since we know that a sequel releases literally next year, the many character deaths feel cheap and pointless, kind of like that of Superman in BvS. And there are way too many heroes to give everyone proper screen time and things to do anyway.There's literally nothing to see here apart from these forced deaths - there's no original plot involved, it's just another CGI purple Homer Simpson lookalike who wants to kill everyone 'for balance' with added amounts of forced drama and tedious dialogues. He also has some CGI minions that look like early-2000's video game villains, but I don't think those were even named. Also the film's largest battle is that between some CGI 4-armed monkeys and an African tribe armed with spears. Yeah.Also, still remember Thor Ragnarok? You know, the one which was mostly pointless as usual, but it did have Thor lose his hammer and eye? Well now it's completely pointless as he has both back. Just like IW will become pointless next year when the follow-up comes around.I quite liked the first two Avengers movies, and while the third one (Civil War) was already slightly overstuffed, it was still serviceable. This, however, just continues the downward trend of movies like Guardians 2 and Thor 3.",5,99,223,6 May 2018
X-Men: Apocalypse," Apocalyptically bad
","I personally thought Days of the Future Past to be the best of the series. And as it turns out, Apocalypse is the worst one to date.The only bright spot in all the awfulness is Quicksilver, whose slo-mo scene is at least as good as in the previous movie, if not better. Other than that, everything else goes from mediocre to outright terrible.The main villain's motivation is bland and stupid. (Yeah, he just wants to kill everyone and rule the world.) The way he 'persuades' other mutants to join him is absolutely unbelievable - he basically just offers to increase a mutant's power and in return demands help to kill billions of people. Sounds like a fair deal. What's offputting is that the extent to which he augments his followers' powers is not constant. Like, Magneto gains the power to control pretty much all the metal on the planet at once, while Psylocke gains another special effect on her CGI laser beams or whatever it is that she emits. Apocalypse's abilities in general are largely undefined - at times he is shown pulling matter from objects around him to construct something, and then in the next shot he just makes solid objects like armor out of thin air. Another ridiculous thing was that they tried to make Isaac more intimidating by giving him thick soles so that he'd look taller, which is noticeable. What is more, his lines are cringe-worthy, but the problem is, so are everyone else's. Same boring cliché dialogues like 'It's your home. We will help. Join us, Eric. I see good in you.'Yeah, forgiving Magneto like it's nothing after he helps to kill millions of people and destroy entire cities is included in the package. Also, he changes his mind about the whole 'destroy the world' thing after Mystique tells him for the 100th time that he is her family and she still sees good in him.Some of the characters' looks are still beyond ugly. I can actually see why they chose to try to keep the Beast and Mystique in their human forms more, except for saving the actors from the extensive make-up procedures. The thing is, these characters look absolutely god-damn atrocious and are painful to watch. I mean, Lawrence is annoying and redundant when she is on screen anyway, but when she is also blue, it just becomes vomit-inducing.Recent 2016 comic-book blockbusters also did not enjoy good scripts, but at least they had high-quality gripping action scenes. This is not the case here, as fighting is mostly goofy and bland, and at times it is clearly visible by the actors' motions that they are being pulled by the strings. Or being drawn in cheap CGI.This is actually sad. Singer's previous movie, DotFP, was outstanding. The recent Deadpool, who ostensibly shares the universe with the X-men, was awesome. And now we get a horrible, outrageously stupid and pretentious CG-overdosed mess. Let's hope the next one will be better.",3,316,531,20 May 2016
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Demise of Star Wars
","Let's see if the third time's the charm.Wow, the lackluster trailers failed to give me any hype for this, so I wasn't even expecting much, but this, this is a new definition of 'low'.Virtually everything in this movie is outright bad. The plot is disjointed and stupid. The action is bland, the space battles lack in scale and logic, with 1 fighter being able to destroy all of a huge dreadnought's cannons. As for lightsaber duels, well, there are none for Christ's sake! And the one fight using sabers has horrible choreography that is nowhere near the spectacle of acrobatic battles of the overly-hated prequels.The characters also suck, both old and new. The largest new addition is an ugly fat (I mean, body-positive) Asian chick who is extra-annoying and whose subplot leads to nowhere. As for the old ones, Kylo and the Ginger still act like hysterical children whereas our Wonder-Girl can still do amazing feats of the Force with no prior training, like holding a ton of boulders without breaking a sweat.The huge problem is that Episode 8 has managed to blatantly flush the intriguing stuff from Force Awakens down the toilet. Big SPOILERS ahead.Made theories about who is Snoke? Nevermind, he is just a CGI model with no backstory who dies after a stupid cliche villain monologue.Thought Phasma would be an actual character, a leader of the stormtroopers? Nah, she is just an extra who also wastes the chance to kill off the heroes to die in an utterly stupid way.Hoped that Luke would kick some butt for the old times' sake? No Sir, he's just gonna project some sort of hologram of himself and then die for no reason! How would he even make that 'hologram' on another planet with the Force?Theorized as to who would be Rey's parents? Obi-Wan, Sarlacc maybe? Lo and behold, they are noname off-screen god-forsaken bums.Sounds amazing right? To add to that there's garbage like:Boring talks about Hope and Resistance; Yoda's cameo who looks like a plastic piece of cr*p from the old movies, talks nonsense and somehow spawns a bolt of lightning even though Force ghosts have never been able to interact with the physical world before; A space casino which looks like a normal Earth casino but with some silly creatures; Leia survives in outer space and flies like Superman though she has never displayed any knowledge of the Force except for some connection with Luke; A lot of sugar-cutie (ice foxes) and disgusting ('Porgs', that thing with nipples) creatures designed so the incarnation of Satan aka 'Disney' would sell merchandise; The annoying Asian prevents Finn from stopping the ram thing for no reason.This isn't even close to everything wrong with this movie, just what I remember off the bat. It's one of the two films that I've ever given a 1/10 to (the other being Movie 43) and the single worst movie in the Star Wars franchise. I now have zero willingness to see Episode 9 or that trilogy that will be written and directed by this movie's creator, Rian 'Worthless Hack' Johnson.The Star Wars are dead, baby. Was fun while it lasted.",1,4,6,2 January 2018
Mission: Impossible II," Mission: Impossibly Cheesy
","So, after seeing the adrenaline-pumped trailer for MI Fallout I decided to go to the franchise roots and finally see the original three films. And while the first one was already cheesy enough, this movie is simply on another level.Since MI2 is old news now, and probably no one will ever read this anyway, I'll just list some of the more ridiculous moments I remember:<ul><li>Implausible love line and how creepy Cruise is when he 'seduces' the discount Zoe Saldana. Also how totally accidentally her perky tits are accentuated in half the shots. Sorry.</li></ul><ul><li>The uncomfortably stereotypical Aussie dude in Ethan's team.</li></ul><ul><li>Constant dramatic zoom-ins on the actors' faces.</li></ul><ul><li>Constant dramatic slo-mo shots.</li></ul><ul><li>Tom Cruise doing backflips and other Wrestlemania-style moves.</li></ul><ul><li>Tom Cruise sliding on the concrete road while holding onto a bike.</li></ul><ul><li>'That punk put a whole in my Versace'.</li></ul><ul><li>How stupid it is that instead of calling in reinforcements to take down the Scottish villain, Ethan works with just 2 guys and keeps a low profile for some reason.</li></ul><ul><li>How stupid it is that destroying the virus samples solves anything, like there the company has no data to reconstruct it at will.</li></ul><ul><li>How stupid it is that Ethan apparently always carries a mask of himself and of the Blonde villain guy, as well as his voice modulator, in case he needs to do a totally unforeseeable switch-up in a critical moment.</li></ul><ul><li>The beginning says 'music by Hans Zimmer', but the music, just like everything else, is also pure trash.</li></ul>",3,1,3,12 February 2018
Silence," Blasphemy
","Forgive Scorcese, Father, for he has sinned. While in general I think him to be quite overrated, I could only classify his previous movies that I've watched as at least 'good'. Well, there's an exception to every rule.I honestly am at a loss for words, there is almost nothing to like in this movie. The whole plot can be described as 'Japanese officials demand Garfield to denounce his religion, he refuses, common folk gets tortured', repeated a good dozen times. The protagonists are unlikable and hard to relate oneself to. (This could be intentional.) The dialogues, which comprise the bigger part of Silence, are boring and at times pretentious. (Yeah, the tree metaphors aren't nearly as smart as they try to sound.) The religious debates are shallow and bland. What's worse, some moments are outright cheesy, like Garfield's reflection morphing into the face of Jesus or God actually talking to him. The movie just fails miserably to get the audience interested and emotionally invested.The only reasons this is not a 1/10 are the quite good cinematography and Andrew Garfield. He, now unshackled from the mediocre Spider-Man reboots, has shown for the second time in a row this year that he is a very potent actor. Still, he alone could not save this movie.You know, the audience's experience kind of reflects the protagonist's journey. First you come to the cinema, expecting a good film on a largely unexplored topic. Then you get tortured for two and a half hours until you lose faith in Scorcese completely.",2,23,41,22 January 2017
The Shape of Water," The Shape of Undeserved Praise
","To be honest, the whole premise of a love story between a woman and some weird merman seemed unattractive to me to begin with, but the Oscars did their advertising job in the end. And my intuition did not fail, Shape of Water is boring, weird, and overly-sweet all at the same time.To start with the good things - visually it's well-filmed and the 60's are stylishly presented. It's nothing ground-breaking, but overall solid. The second good aspect are the actors, everyone plays their roles convincingly. I would point out Michael Shannon in particular, he proved that he can be a great antagonist before, and he's done it again, I was actually rooting for his character throughout.However, the story is a dull bizarre mess. To begin with, it is overwhelmingly unoriginal - the sheepish sugar-sweet lonely protagonist, the captive creature that is tortured instead of being communicated with, the army man antagonist. The movie is just a drag, and everything is as predictable as it can be.Now I can buy the ancient overused trope about the protagonist empathizing to some captive intelligent creature, but explicitly having sex with it? And yeah, there's actually plenty of unnecessary nudity (Shannon shags his wife. Ok.) and allusions to the creature's penis. Well, whatever gets you that Oscar, I guess. I mean I'm no prune, but in my opinion nudity is justified when it helps to convey some point and flesh out the story, not visualize someone's sick fantasies. Sorry, but my suspension of disbelief just doesn't cover the 'woman gets turned on by slippery scaly aquatic monster' thing.To add to that, there's an absolutely redundant meaningless side plot about a gay old man failing to get together with another dude, and a couple of scenes dedicated to showing that Shannon's character has a sexual fetish for silence. That's when you thought this movie couldn' get any more creepy.And since we're at it, I would really question how realistic it is that some random cleaners are allowed access to classified assets in a top-secret research facility. There's also an uncomfortably stereotypical black woman who grossly overcompensates for the muteness of the main character. Also at one point the movie has a horrendously out-of-place musical number in it, like in some Disney flick. Yeah, this merman's design is suspiciously reminiscent of some sidekick of Hellboy in Del Toro's own movie.So, best movie of the year? No way. I've recently also watched 'Three Billboards...', and it's miles ahead than this trash.",3,9,27,14 March 2018
Joker," Overhyped
","As expected, Joker is not the masterpiece everyone makes it out to be.The first 3/4ths of the movie is a generic tear-squeezing sob story about a socially awkward guy who is constantly abused by right about anyone (seriously, he gets beaten up by randoms twice within the first hour or so), and eventually snaps into violence. Up until the final half an hour I leaned towards a 2-3/10, but it finally managed to produce some tense, if predictable scenes. Funnily enough, the movie got better when the titular character started resembling more of its classic version, while all the 'bold reimagining' only managed to produce an unlikeable and unrelatable loser.From the technical standpoint, Joker looks slick with pretty good cinematography. As for acting, Phoenix grimaces too hard here, and I was overall left unimpressed. Have to give credit for the severe weight loss he underwent for the role, though. The music, while mostly fitting, sometimes also adds to the already overly-forced sobbing atmosphere with the least subtle violin ever played. The handful of Batman references here are largely unnecessary for the plot and only work to sell the movie to the broader audience, which, as we all know, worked out pretty well.All in all, Joker tries to be pretentious, artsy and deep, but is only capable to churn out an outplayed moral that our society is toxic and violent, an overacting Phoenix and a few bloody scenes to look more edgy. Forgettable and overrated, although I expected nothing more.",5,4,9,3 January 2020
Wonder Woman," Weak Woman
","The most critically acclaimed movie in the DCEU so far, seriously? In fact, this movie is the most unimaginative and the weakest entry in the franchise so far.There are two good things about the movie really, and those are the leads. First, Gal Gadot is drop-dead gorgeous, this cannot be denied. He acting can be sub-par at times, but overall she plays her part well. Second, Chris Pine is still a charismatic dude who, also being a primary protagonist, delivers his performance well enough and has some of the better comedic moments.But the problem is, that's about it! The action in the movie goes from mediocre to outright messy, with overabundance of CGI and shaky editing. The CGI in general often looks visibly cheap. The sidekick characters are clichÃ© (the only thing that Scotsman lacked was a bagpipe) or cringy (the plump woman, but thank God that's not Melissa McCarthy). The villain is just pathetic, with the cringiest lines imaginable, stereotypical lines like 'Join me or die' and tedious lecturing on the morality of man. Compared to somebody like Zod from Man of Steel it's just unacceptable. The 'humor' here is often out of place with the overall serious war tone of the movie, and goes from the passable 'Diana says some ridiculous stuff about Greek Gods while Steve looks skeptical' to the unbearably ludicrous 'Oh look they talk about sex in a very uncomfortable way'. The plot is just bland and overused, as are most of the dialogues, especially in Themyscira ('You must not go, Diana. Okay, go Diana.') Oh, and our wannabe- pacifist-serial-killer heroine defeats the big baddie using 'the power of love', amazing.So yeah, there is almost nothing to love in this movie, the fact that the critics praised it just shows how hypocritical they are, the main reason for this is the fact that it's female-directed and female-led, which are not important factors when rating a movie in my book. My last hope in the DCEU is the Justice League and I sincerely hope that Weadon will not screw up Snyder's vision in it.",4,2,11,25 June 2017
Black Panther," De Blek Pentha
","So I've decided to fill my only remaining gap in the MCU franchise, and oh my God, this wreck of a movie is the new absolute low not just for superhero flicks, but for cinema in general.It's just horrible in every conceivable way. The plot is disjointed and stupid, with unbearably tedious dialogues and painfully poor acting. Listening to the dialogues is especially repulsive thanks to the African accents the cast is using, so prepare to hear things like 'pentha (panther)' and 'teeknoludgee (technology)'. Chadwick Boseman especially excels at this, delivering a performance that perfectly mimics a speech impediment and an astute case of autism. Every other actor is just as cringeworthy, except for Michael B. Jordan (partially) and Andy Serkis and Martin Freeman, coincidentally the only two white actors in this garbage. But the veteran actors' serviceable performances cannot pull this trash out of the abyss.The setting for the movie is also unimaginably ridiculous - apparently there is a technologically advanced African nation hidden in plain sight. However, despite being so advanced, it selfilshly offers no aid to its neighbors, honors ridiculous savage traditions and has its soldiers armed with spears and swords. Thanks, but even a talking raccoon breaks the suspension of disbelief less than this. If ludicrous colorful costumes weren't enough to annihilate the visual aesthetics of the movie, it's also filled with old video game-quality CGI that makes your bleed, so obviously it stands out.But wait, it's an action movie, right, perhaps there are some thrills to be had? Well no Sir, because about 90% of action sequences are done with the same cheap CGI while the remaining 10% are horrendously choreographed with slow unrealistic motions during fights.To add to all this bedlam this film allows itself racist phrases like 'Great, another white boy to heal'. The fact that this mucus gained over a billion at the box office is disgusting and shows how far both Disney and the herds called 'general audiences' have fallen.",1,3,4,12 May 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," As much as I'd like to love this movie, it's too overwhelming
","I just knew that my overinflated expectations for this movie would let me down. As usual with IMDb ratings, people giving it ecstatic 10s are exagerrating, while haters rating with 1s are not doing the movie justice. For starters, allow me to give a little background, so that the reader knows from whose perspective this review is given:a) I'm not exactly a DC fan, or a comic book fan in general (never really read any since I was a kid)b) This can be inferred from the previous point, but yes, I'm also not a Marvel fan either. I enjoy those movies, but find most of them to be overrated.c) I did quite like Man of Steel. I thought Superman to be an outdated and overall boring character at first, but that film managed to present him in a more relatable and believable way.I will begin by stating my opinion on the movie in general, going in chronological sequence.The movie's opening presents Batman's origin story in a brief fashion. It's emotional, well-shot and does a good job of giving some background for those few that don't know who Batman is. Flashforward to the events of Man of Steel's final moments and we get Affleck's Bruce Wayne running around the city trying to save people. All of that is great, goosebump- provoking and really sets the tone for the terrific movie to come. Another 18-month flashforward and, unfortunately, the problems begin. The whole buildup act (~1,5 hours) of the movie just seems off. This might be because of messy rushed editing (LOADS of cuts to black), or the abundance of sub-plots, which are not that hard to follow, but are bluntly stitched together rather than being artfully intertwined. The titular conflict happens closer to the last hour of the movie, is somewhat brief and overall underwhelming - it turns out, most of it was already shown in the trailers! What is laughable, is how the conflict gets resolved - basically, Batman spares Superman only because he hears him say 'save Martha', which just so happens to be both their mothers' name. Yes, because you call your mother by name when you're close to death. Then we come to the Doomsday fight. My first complaint is that his creation (by Luthor) is explained in a very sketchy fashion. Allow me to elaborate (and don't read this if you seek to avoid what may be considered as major spoilers). So, the downed kryptonian ship had fully functional birth pods in it, which should produce babies in some way. However, apparently, when you put a cadaver in it and add a few drops of human blood, the birth pods go ahead and create a towering monster. So you're left wondering, why would they work this way, what would happen if you don't add any blood (would they just reanimate a corpse?) and why on Earth would Luthor go ahead and create this atrocity when the onboard computer outright said that it contains tons of information about the kryptonian race and other star systems. Oh, not to mention, that he gets into the ship first, when it has been around for almost TWO YEARS and is opened by simple fingerprint recognition, and both the ship and Zod's corpse were in the government's possession all this time. The fight itself is executed well and it's thrilling to watch, but quite short (especially considering how deadly and unbeatable the creature seems at first) and its ending yet again feels anticlimactic and fails to produce any emotional impact. Now a few words about the characters.Superman - I liked Cavill's performance in MoS and I liked it here, too. He's conflicted and I have no problems with that.Batman - He's an absolute beast. I sense a lot of fan backlash incoming, but this Batman kills. Not even kills, but brutally murders dozens of people. Sadly, he only gets one fight scene with random goons, it occurs almost near the ending and was partly shown in the trailers already. Nevertheless, he differs from previous Batman iterations and I think that's good. Definitely looking forward to his standalone movie.Wonder Woman - Awesome. They've basically done what they did with Superman back in MoS: they took an old cheesy character in bright tights and made her actually look formidable and imposing. Also hoping her standalone flick will be a good one.Lex Luthor - Eisenberg is alright, but nothing exceptional here - just a manipulative conniving bad guy. Also, in the very end, Batman pays him a visit in prison and instead of snapping his neck, which seems like the first thing this version of Batman would do right away, just threatens him.Lois Lane - damsel in distress. Enough said.Cameos - While intriguing, I found them to be way too blunt, the filmmakers basically shove them in your face. There is also super strong implication that an even bigger threat is coming, and from what I understood from reading the comments, it's a villain named Darkseid. Okay.Overall, it just feels like too much was cramped into this. As a result we get a situation somewhat similar to Avengers: Age of Ultron - a movie that is good and has potential to be something great, but is burdened by all the universe-building, hints at sequels and all that. An R-rated 3-hour version is coming on Blu-ray and while it may solve the hasty editing problem, I'm not even sure I want to watch it. I wish the DCEU well, it's got potential, but sadly this is not the ultimate superhero blockbuster I was hoping for.",7,1,4,24 March 2016
What We Do in the Shadows," Is this supposed to be funny?
","So I reluctantly decided to watch this film, that had oh such good ratings from critics and audiences alike. What did I see?Well, level of production inferior to some of YouTube videos nowadays, for starters. Everything looks dirt-cheap with laughable effects and poor camera work. I read that the budget was 1.6 million dollars, yet it looks 1.59 million dollars cheaper.But it's not just about the looks, right? It's a comedy, after all, it's the writing that matters! Well unfortunately the jokes here are pure sh*t mostly. It's all dirt-cheap puns about how werewolves act like dogs, so they smell and run after sticks. Or how these guys are vampires, so they can't wear silver necklases as it burns, and they bite people. Oh wow, my belly just hurts so much from all the laughter. There's also some unnecessary vulgarity, which doesn't really help anything.The only reasons this was not a 1/10 are that were like 2 moderately amusing gags, and the whole thing lasts less than an hour and a half, so while it is a tedious bore, it's not as long as it could've been. I heard about this movie after its director and writer Taika Waititi (or whatever) was praised for 'bringing his charm and wit' to Thor Ragnarok, which I'm yet to watch. Well if Thor Ragnarok has the same level of humor as this than it's likely also borderline unwatchable trash.After the credits one of the characters says something along the lines of 'You will forget the contents of this movie'. I wish I did, honestly.",2,1,7,18 January 2018
Annihilation," Annihilation of common sense
","After 'Ex Machina' I expected more from director Alex Garland. Annihilation is pretentious, boring and ultimately style over substance.The premise itself is intriguing - there is an expanding supernatural Zone out of which nobody has returned, except for Natalie Portman's husband, who appears to have no memory of prior events. Portman herself is a university professor who presumed her husband dead.However, everything goes downhill really quick. First, literally on the 3rd minute of the movie we are shown a comet hitting a lighthouse, which immediately eliminates any mystery regarding the Zone's origins, as it's clearly extraterrestrial. Then we are led to believe that the Zone has been expanding for 3 years already. And what has the government organization overseeing it done in the meantime? Perhaps, send a large-scale military/scientific expedition with lots of gear and vehicles? Well no Sir! They have only sent a few small teams, none of which ever communicate or come back. So, by the movie's events, the current squad consists of 5 suicidal women who barely have any relevant skills for the mission. And while all are 'scientists', the only person who tries to do some research is Portman, who at least takes biological samples along the way.And how our 5 girl-scouts act once they enter the zone is unspeakable. They go in without any protective gear(!) and only M4s for weapons(!!), with only Portman having prior shooting experience(!!!), follow no plan and just wander around wasting time(!!!!) and leave no marks to be able to find their way back, as GPS and even compasses don't work(!!!!!).Besides the sci-fi-ish premise, the movie also has some horror elements, so there are obligatory scenes of a team member being snatched from behind, and one team member losing their mind and acting hostile towards others. The latter scene looks very lame, by the way. There is some suspense in the film, but not enough of it.While Annihilation has some pretty, albeit low-budget, imagery, the story feels like its writer just came up with some creepy moments but didn't care to stitch them together in any sensible way. There isn't any sense in Thessa Thompson's turning into some sort of discount Poison Ivy and disappearing. There isn't any sense or consistency in the CG-alien's actions. Why has it 'entered' Jennifer Jason-Leigh and obliterated her? Why hasn't it done so with Portman, and played some copycat game instead? The alien core can be burned to the ground with a single phosphorus grenade, really? Why didn't Isaac's duplicate (whose reveal was as obvious and predictable as possible) also burn down, while all the other alien constructs were destroyed?The answer to all those questions is because the writer did a sh***y job, that's why. Unfortunately, Annihilation is a disappointment.",5,0,2,17 March 2018
Sin City," Flashy wrapping, poor contents.
","Expected so much more from this one. Sin City starts out intriguing, but in the middle gets so terrible I had to actually fast forward through parts of it and fight the urge to press stop and quit watching it. The problem, obviously, is not with the graphic presentation - it's stylish and sometimes very gory. Also gotta take note of the female cast - Jessica Alba is adorable, and others (especially Carla Gugino, to my surprise) are outright hot. But a movie isn't all about its presentation (and boobs, which are plenty here), it's also very much about the plot, and it's pretty damn awful here. The main problem are the characters and the overall goofy comicbook crap that it's based on. Mickey Rourke's ugly character throwing people like he's superpowered, Clive Owen jumping down buildings, creepy cannibalistic Elijah Wood, people surviving totally grave wounds and some ugly disgusting yellow freak are ridiculous and just plain stupid. It is impossible not to see how hard this tries to be 'noir'. with all the black-and-white colouring, constant rain or snow and never-ending inner monologues. But it tries too hard, not achieving much. What the movie lacks is a good source to be based on - maybe some detective novel, some real literature, not this comic book junk from Mr. Miller, who can hardly be called a writer. Only good thing is that now I know that I'm in no way spending money on a cinema ticket to the Dame to Kill For, despite its boob-cast now including Eva Green.",3,1,4,25 August 2014
Spectre," Spectre of the past
","After the brilliant Skyfall, Spectre became one of the most anticipated movies of 2015 for me, the hopes were pretty high. Upon seeing all the mediocre reviews, I rightfully got them down somewhat, but in the end my opinion is that this movie still doesn't deserve a 60/100 rating.I'll begin with the bright sides. First off, from the cinematographic point, the movie's slick, stylish and polished, as expected. Bond's team of Moneypenny, Q and M is given more screen time and a larger role, and it plays that role very well. The action scenes are gripping and tense. For its lengthy runtime of roughly 2 and a half hours, the pacing is fairly even, an improvement over Skyfall's drop in the 2nd act of the movie. Heck, I even liked the generally criticized main theme performed by Sam Smith. Sure, the guy might've overdone it with the high notes, but it fits the signature intro really well.However, I found there to be two main issues with this film. The first one may be a matter of taste, in particular, the casting choice for the main Bond's girl, Léa Seydoux. Not only is she not attractive at all, with circles under her eyes and a gaping hole between her front teeth, but (this is not her, but the screenwriter's fault) the overall love line between her and Bond is strikingly unconvincing. Going from 'don't touch me, you bastard' to 'I love you' in a day and Bond's apparent decision to leave his craft in favour of riding into the sunset with this woman just seems too implausible.The second faulty aspect is the titular organization and its nefarious leader. For starters, the whole 'we've got our agents everywhere' plot is so outdated and overused it has even been in the centre of a recent Bond movie with Craig himself, the mediocre Quantum of Solace. Now we are told that that sinister organization which had its agents everywhere was merely a subsidiary of an even bigger and more sinister organization that has its agents everywhere. (Shocker!) Moreover, in an attempt to connect all Craig's movies into the same continuity, it is revealed that all the main villains from the last three films were part of Spectre, which doesn't really add any depth or any alternative perspective to the previous plots. Sadly, Spectre's leader is also not above criticism. For one thing, his whole motivation just seems flawed - there is no real reason given for why he does what he does. His ties to bond are even more unconvincing - his father took up young Bond as his foster son and they grew close, so Ober... I mean, Blofeld killed his dad and held a grudge on Bond. Seriously? I've got a proposition for a plot twist for a future Bond villain then - they used to be classmates and James bullied him and took his lunch money every now and then, so the villain became a leader of the biggest and the most sinister organization ever and swore an oath that he would torture and kill Bond. My final complaint is the whole Blofeld revelation twist. It was clear from the beginning that it wouldn't work. People who know that Blofeld is a classic Bond villain and the leader of Spectre in the novels and older movies saw this coming from a mile ago, even after the first trailer. And for casual moviegoers the whole revelation didn't mean absolutely anything.A lot of things in Spectre were intended to be homages to the previous Bond era. While some things, like the exploding watch, the customized Aston Martin and Dave Bautista's silent henchman fit well, others like Blofeld's character appear not like an subtle nod, but as something abruptly taken straight out of a 60s film and as a result looking out of place.Yet in spite of the apparent plot faults, Spectre still manages to work and I enjoyed it thoroughly. It is inferior to Skyfall (and Casino Royale, for that matter), but putting it in the same line with Quantum of Solace is unjust. It still is a potent action movie, and agent 007 just refuses to go out of style. Perhaps it's time to stir things up and change the main lead? I personally am looking forward to see which direction will the franchise take in the nearest future.",7,6,16,7 November 2015
