Alien 3," Simply a great ALIEN movie!
","!Warning! This comment will contain spoilers!When I first saw ALIEN 3, I was maybe 13 or 14 years old. I thought it was really a great movie, so later, when I read some reviews, I was surprised how almost everybody hated it! I really liked the idea of setting the story of this movie on a prison planet. The previous films were all dark and scary, but this one also added the depressing element of a rotten, lice infested, dirty prison. Plus the whole religion thing gave a great mystical feeling to the Alien creature. The acting is also very good, and I didn't even mind that Newt and Hicks died right at the beginning of the movie (not that I have something against them). Sigourney Weaver's performance is impressive, just like in the previous films, and the other actors do a really good job too, especially the character of Dillon. The final part of the movie, when the remaining prisoners try to capture the monster in the lead works, is simply brilliant. The scenes done from the look of the Alien are great and they give the chase a claustrophobic feeling, so the thin corridors look even smaller, and you get the impression that the characters can't escape from the Alien. The ending is, in my opinion, the best in the whole series. Ripley sacrificing her self even brought a tear to my eye, because I am a long time fan of the series, I love the character of Ripley, and seeing her sacrifice her self to save man kind was a touching moment. In the end, when they close the prison Fury 161, you realize, that over the movie, you have grown to like the place. And by the way, I think that ALIEN 3 has the best musical soundtrack in the whole series. However, the movie is not perfect. Aside from some of the plot flaws (but the flaws in the plot don't keep you from enjoying the film), probably the weakest point of this movie are the special effects. I'm not talking about the shots were the Alien suit appears, Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff did an amazing job designing and building the Alien and it really looks alive. I'm talking about the shots were we can see the computer generated Alien. The CGI version of the creature looks fake.But this is just a minor flaw in a great movie such as this one. So all I can say is, that this film is in NOT a bad film. It is great and I just don't understand all the negative comments that it is receiving. I can only recommend it!",9,3,46,6 May 2008
