E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Great film, definitely a classic.
","The first time I saw this film is when I was 6, I loved it then, I love it now. The scene when the kids fly on their bikes away from the government officials always makes me cry, even now for heavens sake..... I'm 28 years old! I like the film now for it's innocent and very emotive side, it makes you look at friendships from a child's perspective. All the actors in this film are really good especially Elliot, you really feel for him. Children can give more depth to a role especially when it comes to the subject of friendships. This is a fantastic film, if you haven't seen it please do because it is a classic.",10,1,2,20 January 2006
American Psycho," Read the book by Bret Easton Ellis!
","I really liked the film, not loved, but liked. There is a strange feel throughout you could feel Bateman's loneliness and self absorbed self through the screen. Christian Bale is fantastic in this, he is the film's credit. There are lots of scenes in the film that are very tame compared to the book, I read the book a few years earlier and it is..... terrifying, scary, macabre!! The film has a softer edge, with a lot of the violence from the book not used in the film it makes me wonder if a German or other European filmmaker made it would it be more true to the book? When it comes to the end of the film and he has committed all these murders you want there to be a great ending, which it doesn't quite have. Overall this film is good, watch the film first then read the book!",6,0,1,20 January 2006
The Machinist," ** What the hell!***
","I would like to say first that I thought Christian Bale played this character well, he is a good actor, he really looked and breathed the part of an delusional, paranoid insomniac. However, the film I think is too clever for it's own good, with lots of symbolism involved,(make sure you don't miss a bit of the film otherwise you could have missed something vital to the film's plot.) He is always washing his hands with bleach, the Post It notes on the fridge with a hangman, the dark overtone of the film. The story of the film is lacking something... maybe a fully fledged story, but it does have something, I am going to watch this film again and pick up bits that I missed. I was actually mesmerized with the shear darkness of the film, but I actually thought that the ending was going to knock my socks off..... but unfortunately it didn't. Overall it was a weird film that once I had watched it thought.... what the hell, is it good or is it a bad film, I will have to watch it again and make up my mind.",4,1,3,20 January 2006
The Butterfly Effect," Biggest pile of sh*t I have seen in a while
","At the beginning the film seemed promising, so intrigued I continued to watch. I kept thinking to myself, when the hell is something interesting going to happen? The film felt like it was just plodding along, without any intention to giving it's viewers anything but silliness, bad acting, poor script and shoddy storyline. The young actors in this seemed very wooden and amateurish, I could not for a moment believe them. I advise you not to pay for the film, but...if it happens to be on television, and you have absolutely nothing better to be doing then watch it...Under no circumstances shell out good money to watch it!",3,0,3,19 August 2006
The Sixth Sense," ****Fantastic film****
","This is a great film from beginning to end. M. Night Shyamalan has captured the eerie mood of this film perfectly. His casting with Hayley Joel Osment as Cole and Bruce Willis as Dr. Malcom Crow, Toni Collette as Cole's mother work so well together. Bruce has thrown his blood stained vest in the garbage to do this role, he is utterly believable. I never once thought about his famous catchphrase from his Die Hard film, Yipee Kie hey Mother ******! Hayley Joel Osment is such a great actor beyond his years, it is the first film I have seen where a child actor totally captures such an emotional role. His eyes, face say more than his words, Hayley is a fantastic actor and I hope to see him in more films soon. Toni Collete I think is brilliant in the role of Coles mother she is captivating and has such a fantastic screen appeal. The story has a twist at the end which I think is clever. Overall this film gets 9/10.",9,1,2,21 January 2006
