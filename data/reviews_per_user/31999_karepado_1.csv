It," It's so much more than a horror film
","A flawless movie that combines many genres seamlessly. Characters with unique personalities and quirks which gives it life. A good balance of mood and atmosphere, predictable and unpredictable outcomes, as well as balanced pacing. A nonlinear narrative that feels unpredictable and engaging at all times.It might not be a very scary movie, but it is all about what scary is. You're seeing scary from a kid's perspective. You're seeing them grow and become confident. That's what makes it a good horror movie. In a way it makes you question what horror really is, and that is what makes it special.",10,0,3,25 August 2018
