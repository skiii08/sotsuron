Casablanca," Casablanca(1942)
","The costumes were done excellently in this film. It made it easy to distinguish the different cultures living in Casablanca. The actors did a great job. I enjoyed Rick's very complex character. I thought it was interesting watching the transformation from a self centered man to someone that really stuck their neck out for someone. The lighting in the film was very believable. You would think there were no additional stage lights because it looked very natural. The lighting always put the main focus on the characters. I thought the lighting really accented Ingrid's features. The camera also flows very nice throughout the entire film, moving alongside its characters. I enjoyed the plot and finding out what would happen next.",8,1,3,12 March 2011
The Grapes of Wrath," A respectable film
","I did not think this film was very entertaining or eventful. However I do have respect for it's realism. They did a great job with wardrobe of the characters. They were always dirty. The use of black and white film also helped make them appear that way. These two things really portrayed the poverty and struggle of this family. They were so optimistic for what would come in California. They left their unemployed, poor lifestyle in hopes of a better life as well. Turns out everyone had that same idea. They had come to far to give up and were willing to fight for their share of work out west. Others who had come before were not fond of them coming in and taking work from them. Really, no matter where they were it was going to be difficult. I couldn't imagine a time when basic needs were such a struggle to obtain. This film does a great job at historically showing these events.",Null,0,0,12 May 2011
Annie Hall," Woody Allen does a great job
","Woody Allen did a great job Directing and Acting in this film. Keaton was Allens muse. Her wardrobe is hilarious. It is all her. This is how Keaton chose to dress and Allen told them not to argue that. He thought she was amazing, natural and talented. Because their chemistry is so real, it really comes out in the film. Allen had a really creative way of showing the two sides in every relationship. Using a split screen while talking to their therapist, it shows their different feelings about their relationship. It is so realist. Two people fall in love, then are falling out and face the hardships of this because they do not want to hurt each other. If things do not work out, at least you had learned something. After time apart they find their way back to each other. I loved the message. Woody uses his usual sarcastic ways and good irony. He takes steps out of reality and takes a look at things from a different light. He questions life. He mocks psychology, with 'you learned all that.' Funny, Romantic, highly recommended!",9,0,0,11 May 2011
Singin' in the Rain," love for musicals
",If you like musicals this is one that I would definitely recommend. It is great to see Kelly and Reynolds have so much chemistry on screen. It was said that Kelly gave her a real hard time because she was not a dancer as he was. She could of fooled me. Both performed many forms of dance and did it well. It isn't easy to be synchronized as they were. They are both a triple threat. Not only were they memorizing lines but hundred of choreographed movements as well. Kelly's performance in the 'singingin the rain' scene is one that has been talked about for time to come. It was full of talent and funny at the same time.The story line was very entertaining and educating at the same time. It was comical for them to show the behind the scenes of the studios and to almost mock films which were made before with less technology. I would highly recommend this film.,7,1,2,10 May 2011
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," great film
","Jack Nicholson never fails at portraying a great crazy person. From this film to his many others his characters are always out there. I loved he his character made you question the facility and what really is crazy. Anyone could go crazy listening to that music and repeating the same old thing day to day. He brought something new and alive to these people. He helped the patients see things in a clearer sense, building tension with the staff. It was great to see the characters show who they really were as human beings not the mentally insane. Nicholsons character brought them closer together and showed them the beauty in life. It was funny but also had its heart felt moments. He gives these men a new passion for life. The ending was great. It showed how much he had changed that one persons life and what he had taught them. Do not be afraid of life and living. Great Movie!",9,0,2,11 May 2011
