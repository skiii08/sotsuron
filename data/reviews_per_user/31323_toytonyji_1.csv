Mission: Impossible III," Fall short of high expectation, diminishing value of a great movie series
","I have watched every trailer video clip before the actual movie comes out.The experience of waiting for the releasing date was agonising and painful. Finally the date has come ,somehow the the screen is shockingly empty less than 10 person in a 200-seats screen for the first day. Th start sequence is a bit confusing , the reverse order of a story-telling format is unusual for a gadget-spy-action film.Unlike most the James bond films the start sequence starts with a futuristic gadget using combat scene which is always a good way to get everyone's attention and blow their mind off. This one starts with a interrogation which consist with the time frame of midsection of the story.The decision of the major villain comes out first really kills the curiosity and wondering of the viewers.Yes, I know it is a spy-action but the shooting angle and style of the film is not very film cautiously designed and perhaps too perfectly done to a point of unrealistic.None of the combat scenes in the film is flashy enough and all of them have failed to impress me and blown my mind off,specially the last combat scene that took place in the hospital.It's either because the director lacks of innovations in new ideas of presenting the combat or perhaps everything been done already.I refuse to believe the 2nd reason is why the combat scenes are such a major letdown.The biggest mood-killer is the combination a love drama and a action film.Too much time used on describing the relation changes of the two couple.Why would someone want to watch what a spy live a normal life is like?The deliberated attend of bring up the conflicts of two identities over a character has hardly generated any interests from the viewers. Disappointments:The 2nd biggest disappointment is the ending.Come on! Smiling and happily walking away???!!!What was that?A ending shares varies resemblances of a sitcom ending from the 70's.That was a truly appalling ending.What a clich√©.However the ending is nothing compare to the outrageously simple storyline and predictable characters. Thw plot is just too predictable to be attractive to anyone.",1,4,12,4 May 2006
