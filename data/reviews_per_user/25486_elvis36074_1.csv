Walk the Line," Walk the Line
","There aren't many movies that I can sit thru and still want to see more when it is over . This one is different. 'Walk the Line' surprisingly is appealing to all age groups, too. I have found from talking to teens who have seen it that you don't have to know the country music era of Johnny Cash to enjoy this one. If you happen to be a 'baby boomer', it just adds to the experience. Witherspoon and Phoenix perform so much like Carter and Cash, and it is evident that they really had their heart in their work. Add to that the fact that they were singing and playing 'for real', and it should be enough to earn them an award for best actress/actress in such an outstanding performance. Put it on the top of your list of movies to see, and do it before it goes off the big screen. You won't be sorry.",9,0,1,17 December 2005
