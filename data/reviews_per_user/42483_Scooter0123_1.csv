The Legend of Bagger Vance," Great Film - Even if you 'HATE Golf'
","If you have ever suffered a setback, or faced a situation in your life that left you hurting and wounded, here is a movie that, with its beautiful scenery, beautiful people, humor, and a wonderful pervading sense of the supernatural will lift your spirits and encourage you. Take great performances from Will Smith as Bagger and Matt Damon as Junuh...add Bruce McGill and Joel Gretsch - believable and amusing as Walter Hagan and Bobby Jones, and Charlize Theron- sparkling and feisty as a genteel Southern Belle, plus great character actors and the little J. Michael Moncrief cast as Hardy Greaves (through whose eyes the story is told) plus great Redford direction, and it adds up to a wonderfully warm film. While this is a story about golf and golfers, it is a story even those who 'hate' golf can identify with...it's about life, and triumphing over adversity. The late Jack Lemmon, as the aged Hardy Greaves sets the stage at the beginning, and the movie never loses focus. This is not an action movie. It's a thinking, feeling, allegory of life. It's a feel-good flick that is safe for the whole family and one that is well worth two-hours of your life to experience.",10,0,1,24 February 2007
