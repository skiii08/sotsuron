The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," And if we burn, you burn with us
","I don't understand why people are giving such bad reviews to this ? It was a wonderful experience. For those who are complaining about 'nothing really happens blah blah' Didn't you see in the title that it is 'Mockingjay Part 1'. It's just the beginning of The End, which was an epic introduction that how great the last part will be. And I mean what else did you expect? For me it was a very good movie. It was really touching and I really enjoyed it and yeah it also gave me goosebumps at some points. Jennifer Lawrence once again has proved that she is one of the best actress in Hollywood. She really acted great. The rest of the cast did great too. People who are giving negative reviews, actually they are used to enjoy death-games of hunger games only. It's not only thrill and action that always matters.This movie is different from the first two movies because there were games in the first two movies, but now it's about the relationship between the Panem and The Capitol. But still there are a number of great thrilling scenes, which I really enjoyed, however, the sad thing is that I'll have to wait one year for the next part for which I am anxiously waiting. I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone, if you are a true movie fan you will really enjoy it. Thanks, have a good day.",10,26,67,22 November 2014
Gravity," Visually Stunning, and Overall a Good Movie
","So, today I went to watch the 2013's most Awaited Sci-Fi Movie 'Gravity' starring One of my favorite Stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney.I was waiting for it for a long time but couldn't watch it earlier at its release. Alfonso Cuarón did his best again.Graphics were Amazing and movie was worth watching. It's less Sci-Fi and more breathe taking thriller in Space that's beautifully Directed.The award winning actress Sandra Bullock & George Clooney were also great in their acting.This is one of best Science Fiction and Space movie I've ever seen and definitely is in year's top 10 films list but i think it's a very little bit overrated. I am not saying that it's not worth watching I am just Reviewing it.Well, Overall it's a Good movie and you'll enjoy watching it in 3D.2013 released many big Sci-Fi's like Ironman 3, Pacific Rim, Star Trek Into Darkness, Elysium and Gravity is best than all of these in Cinematography.You should definitely put this into your watch list for your next movie weekend.And I would highly recommend this to you. P.S My English ain't very good so Please Excuse any Mistake ;)Have a Nice Day :)",9,2,4,11 November 2013
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Wow
","No spoilers ahead. So, I went to see The Winter Soldier, today, and I loved it.It was amazing.Well, Marvel movies are always good but this is best of its kind.I didn't much like Captain America The First Avenger but this is absolutely worth watching and is a great Action-Thrilling movie.There were so many great scenes, acting was great and story was perfect. It is not just a superhero movie.So, don't wait just go and enjoy it.I highly recommend it to all of the people out there who are confused about what movie they should watch this weekend. P.S don't just walk out of there at credits..Do not miss Post-Credit Scenes.Thanks and have a good day.",10,5,10,24 April 2014
Interstellar," Interstellar!
","The movie was great. As a matter of fact Nolan's movies are always great but as this was his first complete Sci-Fi movie, it was an amazing experience, as visually and conceptually audacious as anything Nolan has yet done, the director's ninth feature also proves more emotionally accessible than his coolly cerebral thrillers and Batman movies. 'Interstellar' is another one of Christopher Nolan's more personal mind-blowing movies.That said, just about everyone so far seems to agree that Interstellar is worth seeing in the biggest format possible, for the visuals alone. It was visually stunning and the cast did great. The Oscar winning actor Matthew McConaughey played the leading role wonderfully.It's surely worth seeing on big screen. You should go see it too. ;)",10,1,6,14 November 2014
Avengers: Endgame," Thank you MARVEL!
","Endgame was brilliantly executed giving a perfect end to an already perfect Avengers series and a great conclusion to 22 Marvel movies.It starts slowly, but that's because the story develops. Everything else the cast, characters, cinematography was impressive.Highly recommended.Will miss Marvel movies after the last movie in Marvel Cinematic Universe (Spiderman: Far from Home)",10,0,3,29 April 2019
1917," Breathtaking
","Just saw this movie last night and it was so good that it's easily one of the top films of 2019 along with Parasite. It richly deserves all the three Oscars that it won. The story, the cinematography and the visual effects all were impressive and amazing and the cast did wonderful job. Recommended for everyone.",10,0,1,22 February 2020
Mulholland Drive," Exceptional
","To be honest I did not get this movie like everyone else for the first time and kept guessing until the end. This movie was in my watchlist for 6 years and I was too lazy to watch it. But now after watching it, I would definitely recommend it to anyone. This movie is not a typical Hollywood movie but a very thought provoking one. It's just a another masterpiece from Finch which is even better than his other films Lost Highway and Blue Velvet. I'm not going to write more about the movie and I'm gonna leave it to you to see it for yourself and then love it.",10,3,4,9 May 2019
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Disappointed
","I was neither lucky nor unlucky to watch this movie. I am not going to spoil anything for anyone, so I will just sum up the movie for you. Although, the movie had a lot of action, destruction and science-fiction in it but it seemed kind of dull to me. I was so excited for this one but it did not live up to my expectations. There are way too many flaws in it. This is nothing compared to the original. The plot is quite uninspiring. I don't know much about comic story but on the screen the plot is weak.There are one-liners after every two minutes of the movie, which I would rather criticize than praise because they had a world to save. Also, there is no character development and Ultron guy is the worst villain I have ever seen in any Marvel movie and is so boring. I did not expect from Marvel to mess up with such a big movie especially the script. It may become the highest grossing movie of the year or second or third highest but the fans would be disappointed. The only reason I am rating it six stars is that CGI effects were impressive plus Hawkeye, Quicksilver and his twin sister Scarlett Witch were great. I would recommend everyone to wait for the DVD rather than go to cinema and get disappointed on big screen, unless you don't care about money. Thank you! :)",6,3,8,4 May 2015
Everest," Wonderful, Elegant, Moving and Beautiful..
","I was very excited for this movie. I watched it last night and I really loved it. It is an excellent movie. Baltasar Kormákur (Director) has successfully conveyed the emotions subtly and with respect for the true heroes of the expedition of 1996. His film perfectly demonstrates how Mount Everest is an extremely dangerous place for human beings.As it is based on a TRUE STORY, it makes you think about the characters, how they suffered, how this affected their lives, their families and so on. It shows the fighting resolve of human beings. This movie was a breathtaking and heart touching experience and almost made me cry.It had great casting, engaging cinematography and powerful sound. They made the right choice in characters and the focus was on right people. Jason Clarke and Josh Brolin were amazing in their roles. Visual effects were most impressing and the fact the some of the scenes were actually shot on Mount Everest makes it even great. I think everyone should go see this movie. It was truly a moving picture. In the end, RIP to people who died on Mount Everest in 1996.",10,0,2,3 October 2015
The Conjuring," Truly Horror Movie with Great Story..
","I was fortunate enough to see The Conjuring last night, a movie I have been waiting for, for a long time.And because I know there are a lot of people out there who still have to see it.I will not spoil anything, which makes it a bit harder to review the movie at this time, but I'll give it my best.I love horror films, especially the Supernatural sub-genre and The Conjuring is the newest on the list of impressive low budget.Loved the beginning of movie.The Cast is great..The Story is perfect and thrilling. Its a great Horror Movie.If you like Haunted House type horror movies you should definitely watch and one last thing this you need to know about this movie is that it is based on a true story which makes this movie more interesting and scary.I really enjoyed this movie and it will make you jump and scream..",9,0,2,18 August 2013
Deadpool," Deadpool. A new class of superhero!
","From the studio that inexplicably sewed his *beep* mouth shut the first time, comes Deadpool. Yeah Deadpool, that sounds like a *beep* franchise. Absolutely amazing movie by Marvel. Now I can say that I forgive Marvel for messing Avengers 2. Deadpool is the first 'R- Rated' movie that I have ever seen in cinema and I enjoyed every second of it, thanks to the censor board that they didn't ban it in our country otherwise my weekend would've been ruined if I hadn't got to watch Deadpool. Deadpool is not a typical superhero movie, so even if you don't like to watch superhero movies, you will love Deadpool. Ryan Reynolds was a perfect choice for Deadpool who did a fantastic job in his role and the script was very original, funny and well written. It has multiple elements including action, comedy, romance and most of all emotions. Moreover, this is not just a superhero movie, this is a love story that's why it's being released on Valentine's day. So, go on see it, enjoy it and have a laugh later. Especially for single people who do not have any date on V's day, Deadpool is the best gift that they will ever get *haha*. No doubt it is and will be one of the best movies ever produced by Marvel along with The Avengers. I'd recommend this movie for everyone who is allowed to watch it in their jurisdiction. Have a great weekend!",10,31,66,13 February 2016
Apollo 13," Couldn't hold my tears - BEST MOON MOVIE EVER!
","Oh god!
I can't tell you how beautiful this movie is.
And the fact that it is based on true events makes it so real and so thought provoking.
I couldn't stop crying in the end.
I hate myself for watching this in 2019, I mean I should have watched it earlier.
This is hands down the best space movie ever!
WATCH IT RIGHT NOW!",10,0,1,11 September 2019
The Martian," Bring him home!
","I have just watched it in 3D and I was really amazed by experiencing loneliness & silence of Mars. The film is visually stunning. Thanks to Ridley Scott for such a great movie.Excellent adaptation of the book and the film is beautiful, with its sweeping Martian landscapes.It's a space science fiction movie that aims to gain viewer's trust: trust that they will bring Watney Home, trust that they will present the science as it would be without feeling the need to simplify it to boredom or over complicate it so it distracts from the plot.Cast, sound, direction, settings, special effects, editing are perfect.The soundtrack is really good, the cinematography will leave you breathless. Matt Damon is amazing in the film!The Martian is one of the smartest and most emotionally engaging blockbusters for a while. Highly recommended for everyone. Go see it in 3D (I did and I didn't regret it apart from hurting my back a bit from being on the edge of my seat!)",10,2,40,4 October 2015
