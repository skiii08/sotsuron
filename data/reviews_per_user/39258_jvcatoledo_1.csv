Ghost," Bravo Whoopi!
","When I saw this movie for the first time I really liked it. Not just because it's a nice romantic film, but also because Whoopi Goldberg is fantastic in it and, obviously, deserved that Oscar. She didn't just bring some comedy to the movie, she acted perfectly.For the first time I kind of liked Demi's performance (and hey, she was playing a normal woman...). The sound-track by Maurice Jarre is touching and very appropriate to the movie. The don't think I'll ever get tired of this love story.",9,4,5,13 February 2001
