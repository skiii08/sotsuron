Scarface," Stopped Watching
","This is not really a proper review since I did not see most of the film. I stopped watching it. The film is very violent, with nasty drug dealers and street punks, but that is not why I stopped watching.Here was the problem: I watched just enough to be introduced to several characters, all of whom were not interesting. Everyone was a tedious, despicable psychopath, with no engaging personalities, giving me nothing to look forward to. I found myself not the least bit curious about what they would do next or what might happen to them.If there had been even one person of interest, and I don't mean good or nice person, I mean an interesting person, I could have stayed with it. Watch 'State of Grace' to see what I mean. In that film the Gary Oldman character is a complete lunatic, but he is *very* interesting. Al Pacino perhaps did a good job in Scarface, but his character just did not engage me.",1,39,85,21 October 2009
In Bruges," Delightful Tour De force
","I don't need to repeat anything about the plot line since you have already read it, or should have. In any event I found this film to be a wonderful diversion. What we soon learn is that the two hit men are completely unsuited to the job. They are complex, morally conflicted and emotional, while their employer is a cynical psychopath. Having some time off with these two in the Belgian city of Bruges during Christmas allows us to move about the old city on a sight seeing tour, punctuated with serendipitous or chaotic encounters with other people and interactions between the two leads. Along with the Christmas lights there is some violence, but it is integral to the black comedy aspect of the film. Some of the violence is quite comical.The addition of a film in production within this film adds another level. Two of the supporting characters come out of that inner film, in a certain way providing a connection between waking and dreaming. Bit parts played by people in fantastic costumes add to the magic of what might otherwise be a purely dark scene.All the characters are very carefully crafted. As another review stated this is (in part) a character study. It is also designed to be very entertaining, which it is. I enjoyed it immensely. A bit slow moving at times, but this is a European film which holds the value of the stage very high, yet it does not appear staged. It puts you right there. The direction, the camera work and the acting all work together to give a real experience.",9,3,4,7 August 2015
The Others," Disappointing
","I had hopes that this film would offer some creative thrills. Unfortunately, it started off badly. Nicole Kidman, although playing the role well, played the role of an annoying neurotic. Sorry, hard to have much sympathy with her character. And as it went on, things often did not make sense. Some plot elements contributed nothing to the story and seemed to be no more than distractions. I just did not like the way it played out, waiting for the tension to build but it never really did. And worst of all, when the surprise ending arrived, I felt cheated. Of course, I can't explain why without revealing the whole plot. Pity.",4,1,4,12 January 2013
