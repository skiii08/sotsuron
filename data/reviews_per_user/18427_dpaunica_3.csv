Ford v Ferrari," Magnificent
","Christian Bale and Matt Damon were fantastic in this adrenaline filled incredibly shot fast paced real-life story. Oscar for Bale, I hope.
And I remember there was a GT40 at the dealership last Fall - I am going to check it out :)",10,2,3,18 January 2020
Joker," Oscar material
",Funny guy Todd Phillips of Hangover fame gives up comedy because of the 'woke' culture and creates a masterpiece in the process. The movie works perfectly even w/o any knowledge of the Batman universe. Joachim Phoenix should have his Oscar guaranteed.,10,3,5,28 October 2019
The Big Short," Required viewing for all adults
","An attempt to explain what happened during the last major financial crisis by trying to make things as simple and clear to understand as possible, and enlist great actors to deliver the message.
A required viewing for all adults, not only for the ones who can think their fortunes may be on Wall Street.
And after that go watch Margin Call with Kevin Spacey.",10,1,3,7 December 2019
