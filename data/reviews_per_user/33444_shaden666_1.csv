The Blair Witch Project," Making the less effort possible
","This is, plain and easy, a bad movie. This the kind of movie someone does when the have a limit of $5 and don´t want to make the effort of making a decent movie.There´s no reason to think it´s a good movie. The script was probably made in 30 minutes, and anyone could make this movie.But it´s not as bad to deserve a 1/10, it´s a little funny if you don´t have anything else to do. 3/10",3,0,2,26 January 2004
