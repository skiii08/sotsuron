The Blair Witch Project," Much better than its reputation
","It seems many people dislike this film because they think the entirety of its reputation lay in the confusion/publicity campaign generated at the time of its release as to whether it was a real film found in the woods of Maryland that documented the disappearance of three college students or whether it was just a movie. What made this film scary in 1999 and scary now is what you don't see and what you think you hear as well as the growing paranoia and fright of the college kids lost in the woods over a period of days that find - as they run out of food and supplies - that they are just wandering in circles.The very last scene is particularly chilling, and if you already know how it ends it will kill some of the fright factor for you. However, this film just proved in 1999, as it still does, that you don't have to fill a horror film with wall-to-wall state-of-the-art CGI visual effects and shocking violence in order to be scary. I personally think the horror genre has been much worse off since Jason and his ilk first invaded the movies back in 1980 with graphic violence that is predictable and, quite frankly, boring. Although I like this movie, the sequel, 'Book of Shadows', is just awful. Its makers Hollywoodized the original concept and thus made it completely incoherent and unwatchable. Avoid it at all costs.",7,5,8,19 December 2009
Saturday Night Fever," There's no denying it...
","... this is a product of my generation. I was the age that Travolta's character Tony was in 1977, although in a completely different part of the US. Probably the disco era is the only one in the history of film in which people in street clothes look like they are going to a costume party. The pointy collars, the shoes, the hair so full of hairspray that it looks like it would shatter if it brushed up against something, and those jackets that are so full of holes - big ones - they look like they were attacked by moths and why are we calling them jackets anyways?So Tony (Travolta) is a New York City born and bred Italian American with only a high school education, an employee at a dead end job - selling and mixing paint - in a store that is now extinct - the neighborhood hardware store that is about to get replaced by the big box hardware stores such as Harbor Freight. Dad is used to being the head of the family, but now he has been laid off in middle age. Suddenly Edith is talking back and disrespecting Archie and he doesn't like it one bit. And the only thing that makes Tony feel alive is Saturday nights on the dance floor of the local disco where he is the best.And then he meets a girl - Stephanie. She is everything that I, a Texan, was told that New Yorkers are - loud mouthed, self important, snooty. And yet Tony follows her around like a puppy because he is in love. Annette (Donna Pescow) follows Tony around like a puppy because she is in love. It's funny how Tony doesn't like how Stephanie treats him, yet he turns around and treats Annette the same way. But Tony turns out to be much more self aware than you would think. And Stephanie - there is much more to her story than her being just another stuck up Manhattanite.There is so much casual sex going on here that it answers the question 'Where did herpes come from?'. But it is so much more than glittering disco balls. it is a love story. A story of a guy learning about the friendship component of love. It is a tragedy. It is a story of young people at a crossroads. And last but not least, it has probably one of the great soundtracks in motion picture history and gave the Bee Gees a second act. I'd highly recommend it. Just try to ignore your probable first reaction 'Yikes those clothes!!!!''.",8,0,0,8 March 2020
The Avengers," The viewpoint of an old classic movie fan who does not read comic books...
","... but is the ultimate fan of Joss Whedon. I came to this film with virtually no background in the Marvelverse, so I was a bit confused at first. My husband helped fill in the blanks by stopping the film when I had questions, but I have to admit the script did a good job of filling in the blanks minus a few details. This is an excellent film of its genre that incorporates everything special effects can do today with great character development, courtesy of Joss Whedon who wrote and directed this blockbuster masterpiece. Do you know how rare it is to have blockbuster and masterpiece in the same sentence? He has to know that at some level that he, once again, did the impossible. He took what could have easily been a disaster and he produced gold. He created a movie that was fun, and exciting and shaped and brought cohesion to the Marvel Movie Universe and gave each character their time to shine. It has great acting; quippy dialogue; tons of very well done action; and a decent, if underplayed, level of ambiguity to the morality of the characters. They worked individually, they worked collectively. It had lots of Ultimate Alliance moments. Hulk shoves a piece of armor into the giant worm and Thor hammers it into his head, Thor brings his hammer down on Cap's shield and causes a huge shockwave, Thor shoots lightning at Iron Man and causes his suit to boost up to like 400+% giving him a supercharged shot. I love that all of those moments were added. I also love how Joss had a bunch of the heroes fight each other in a way that made sense in the context of the movie. Thor vs Hulk, Thor vs Cap, Thor Vs Iron Man, Hawkeye vs Black Widow, Black Widow vs Hulk. You can't help but love each and every fight. Will people still be talking about it 80 years from now the way they talk about Citizen Kane? Probably not. But Whedon accomplished in the 2010's in making a film in which I was completely engrossed for two and a half hours, had a wonderful and fun time and wondered where the time had gone when the credits rolled. And isn't that why we go to the movies in the first place?",10,6,10,5 April 2017
Vertigo," This film takes repeated viewings to really appreciate it...
","... and perhaps that is why it bombed upon initial release.When Vertigo was first released in 1957, it was not that popular in theaters and was pretty much universally panned by critics. In 1992, when the British Film Institute performed a survey of the world film critics to compile an all-time ten-best list that comes out every decade, Vertigo came in at fourth place. It didn't even make that list in 1962 or 1972. Part of the reason for the delayed popularity of the film could be that it requires repeated viewings to really gain an appreciation of it. Such repeated viewings were not possible for most viewers until the advent of home video systems and cable around 1980.It is unusual to see a director produce his best work after the age of 50, but that is exactly what Alfred Hitchcock did. Starting in 1948 with 'Rope' and ending with 'The Birds' in 1963, this was the era of his most inspired films. 'Vertigo', in my opinion, is the best film of his entire body of work.As for the film itself, it is a brilliantly twisted movie infused with touches of genius and madness that focuses on the interconnected nature of love and obsession. Interwoven with this main theme is a crime mystery that is revealed to and solved for the audience but not the protagonist, James Stewart's character, for the last 45 minutes of the film.Alongside these themes is the issue of lost opportunities - how we grieve over them, and whether or not what we perceive as lost opportunities were ever 'real' opportunities in the first place. This issue is raised not only for Scotty (James Stewart), but for just about everybody else in the cast too. This includes Scotty's college girlfriend (Barbara Bel Geddes) who has remained his friend through the years and obviously still harbors thoughts of what might have been if only she had accepted Scotty's marriage proposal years before.Besides the excellent acting and superb plot, the score is outstanding as is the cinematography, especially the visual darkness of the mission San Juan Bautista versus the angelic beauty of Madeleine which belies what is really going on. I highly recommend this film to anyone who has the time to watch it more than once. Just one viewing won't do it justice.",10,9,13,21 November 2009
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," If the fourth Star Wars movie had been the first there never would have been a second
","Let's face the awful truth. You don't even need to watch the film to see what is going on. You can just listen to - or for that matter just read the lyrics of - Weird Al Yankovic's 'The Saga Begins' and you have seen the movie. Besides impressive special effects and good acting from a stellar cast there is nothing to see here people, move along.I say good acting because it is not the cast's fault they were given mundane dialogue and thus portrayed characters I just did not care about. The only interesting idea brought up here not brought up in the original trilogy is that fear in sufficient amounts is necessary for survival, but in excess it can destroy a person. And that it is possible for a nine year old boy to hit on a fourteen year old girl and have a shot AFTER puberty. That's it, that's all. It's not a menace, but this film is definitely a phantom of the first two Star Wars films and maybe even of the third, which was also a step down in quality in my humble opinion.",4,6,13,22 December 2015
10 Cloverfield Lane," Less action than in the first film in this belated sequel
","Belated pseudo-sequel to the divisive 2008 movie Cloverfield. That first film dealt with an unexplained giant monster attack in NYC, and was shot in the 'found footage' style: everything shot with a video camera, as if by one of the characters within the film, with all the shakiness and amateurishness one would expect. The idea is to lend the film added verisimilitude and place the viewer within the narrative. This works only occasionally, and in my opinion Cloverfield was one time that it did. However, that being said, this sequel does away with that narrative device, and is shot in a traditional, stationary manner, with known actors and professional cinematography.The story follows Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a young woman in an unhappy relationship who packs her bags and hits the road, leaving her boyfriend and driving toward parts unknown. She suffers a terrible car accident, and when she awakens, she's chained up in the underground bomb shelter of the distinctly odd Howard (John Goodman), a conspiracy theorist and survival nut who claims that while Michelle was unconscious, the world up above has come to an end. What caused it, he isn't sure (Russian nukes? Terrorist bio-weapons? Alien invaders?), but he knows it isn't safe to step outside. Also in the shelter is goofy country boy Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.), a former employee of Howard's in the construction of the shelter.The vast majority of the movie is a slow-burn suspense drama, as Michelle tries to learn more about her surroundings, and the two roommates she's now forced to live with. You know Howard isn't all there, but just how far gone is he? Or are his most outlandish claims only the tip of the iceberg? These scenes are well-done for the most part, and the actors are all good, especially Goodman, who uses his bulk to great advantage. Winstead does great work as well, using her eyes more than anything to project her performance. The problems for me came in the relatively uninspired script. There wasn't really a beat in the film that I didn't see coming, and all of the characters ended up where I expected them to be within the first 10 minutes. The dialogue, too, while showing a tiny bit of wit here and there, didn't hold my attention as well as I hoped. I won't go into the film's last act, only to say that 'Cloverfield' is in the title for a reason, but don't expect the giant monster action of the first film. Directorial debut of Dan Trachtenberg. From Paramount.",6,0,0,9 July 2017
Ghost," Made as a summer blockbuster, it brings up interesting philosophical points
","I have to admit that Demi Moore as artist Molly and Patrick Swayze as Sam, an investment banker, had great chemistry. This was extremely popular when it came out in 1990, even winning an academy award for Whoopi Goldberg, whose career had been on a downturn up to that point.Sam and Molly have a great life in New York City. She is an up and coming artist, he is doing well at his investment banking job. They turn part of a run down building into a yuppie paradise loft apartment. But Sam has a problem expressing his love verbally. And then Sam and Molly are mugged by a common street criminal one night while walking home. Sam is shot and killed while defending Molly, and suddenly finds himself outside of his own body. Nobody can hear him. Nobody can see him. But he can converse with other 'ghosts' that he finds. He hangs out in his old apartment to be near Molly, and then something happens that makes him think his murder was not a coincidence. The guy who killed him lets himself into his apartment with a key and begins looking for something in particular. He is obviously not there to steal the television. And from there the murder mystery begins.I still salute this movie for one inventive turn - the most unlikely protagonist ally in film history - Whoopi Goldberg as a fake psychic who turns out to be the only person who can hear Sam. She is rude, crude, at times greedy, somewhat racist and very mouthy and with a rap sheet a mile long for bunco artistry. But she does end up helping Sam, although he spends all night at her bedside singing 'I'm Henry VIII I am' to get her to cooperate. However, you will like her, in part because she is so real and believable.The philosophical questions I mentioned? I guess the biggest question raised is who is a 'good' person worthy of heaven and who is a 'bad' person worthy of hell? Are there mitigating circumstances? The film has both of Sam's murderers going to hell. Were they BOTH that bad? One of the killers seemed like he might have been a good person until greed tempted him to the point that he got in over his head for some quick money. He was like Fred C. Dobbs in 'Treasure of the Sierra Madre' without the gold mine and the endless Mexican desert. And what about Sam? He kills two people , at first attacking them to defend others - and it has got to be scary being chased and beat up by something you can't see - but he seems to have fun scaring them to the point of frenzy. I mean, what did he think was going to happen in each case? Yet he seems surprised when they end up dead at his hands in what could be considered self defense taken to the point of revenge. Yet he goes to heaven. Maybe the scale of eternal reward doesn't weigh acts performed after death? Ponderous.This one might seem cheesy at points, especially the pottery making/lovemaking scene, but I think it still holds up over time. I'd recommend it.",9,4,6,14 August 2016
Casablanca," As time goes by Casablanca is timeless
","Most films about WWII made during WWII are so rah-rah over the top that at midpoint you want to stand up and say 'OK, I get it already, the Nazis are eeeeeevil.' This one is different. There are bad guys - Conrad Veidt's Major Strasser who practically slithers on his belly and hisses like a snake he is so vile, guys that are so good that their teeth sparkle in the sunlight - Heinreid's Victor Lazlo, and a whole bunch of gray characters just trying to get by - the kind of guys who vote for who they think the winner is going to be in a Presidential election. Maybe these gray characters are truly out for themselves and see it as a game or a matter of survival - Claude Rains's Captain Renault, or maybe they were fighters for the good fight at one time and when karma dealt them a bad blow they became cynical - Bogart's Rick Blaine.You've got a great supporting cast - Greenstreet, Lorre, Sakall, and Dooley Wilson as Sam, a guy with a rare level head who looks out for Rick and seems to see Rick's cynicism as an illness he has to be nursed through while tickling those ivories - a rare humanizing role for an African American in 1942.Plus this thing defies all laws of synergy - it works on a grand scale as an entire work of art, but you can break out individual scenes and enjoy them divorced from the rest of the film, and there are great individual lines suitable for framing 'I stick my neck out for no man' and ' I'm shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here' says Captain Renault as he closes down Rick's and stuffs gambling winnings into his pocket - this last line has almost become a metaphor for American politics and politicians.Bottom line - Rick Blaine is Han Solo. Both characters were vital to the success of the films in which they starred. People always love a romance/adventure involving a talented cynical loner who ultimately joins or rejoins the good fight for the right reasons, a guy who is a bit too good to be true, and a woman who is torn between actually loving the first kind of man and feeling like she should really love the second kind of man. That is Casablanca and that is Star Wars, but Star Wars does not have Captain Renault and Casablanca does! Wow, I've always been afraid of reviewing Casablanca because I didn't know where to start, and it looks like I just did.",10,3,4,23 September 2012
Detroit," True story suspense drama that is entertaining enough
","It's 1967, and rioting and looting has broken out in the city of Detroit, with buildings being burned and shots being fired. The situation has progressed to the point that National Guard troops have been mobilized in the streets, and no one is safe. It's with this setting that the main story unfolds when shots are reported fired from a hotel, and police and troops converge on the building, leading to tense situation that leaves several people dead. The cast includes John Boyega as a black, uniformed security guard who gets swept up in events; Will Poulter as the leader of a trio of beat cops who take things too far; Algee Smith as an aspiring pop singer who has the misfortune of checking into the hotel; Anthony Mackie as a recently discharged Army veteran.This seemed like the kind of film to ignite a firestorm of controversy, with its setting of racial unrest and us-vs-them police misconduct coming on the heels of the recent incidents across the country, from Ferguson to Baltimore. Maybe people were exhausted from the news, or perhaps other current event spectacles rendered past injustices as moot points, whatever the reason, the film flopped at the box office although the critics enjoyed it. I liked it as well, but not as much as they did. Bigelow and Boal previously collaborated on the superior The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty. They attempt a 'you are there' cinema verite style that uses a lot of handheld camera and very little gloss or overly stylish cinematic tricks. They also made the wise decision to cast relative unknowns so as not to distract from the story, with the biggest names in the cast (Mackie and Krasinski) in lesser roles.There's quite a bit of build up before the movie gets to its main focus, but that may have been necessary to explain the actions of those involved when things finally hit the fan. Running just under 2 and a half hours, I found it a bit over long, and could have seen at least 15 minutes trimmed away. The performances are good for the most part, but I'm not too fond of Poulter. This isn't a bad movie at all, but it is hardly a stand-out in Bigelow's catalog of films.",6,9,13,19 February 2019
John Wick," Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my dog, prepare to die...
","... slaughtering a line from the superior 'Princess Bride'. It's a shame that Keanu Reeves is supposed to be one of the nicest guys to work with in Hollywood, because this film is a mess. We should stop asking Hollywood to come up with original ideas, because when they do, this is the result. 101 minutes of cliched action that checks all of the boxes - retired hit-man coming out of retirement, a boy and his dog, the perfect wife who is conveniently dead, stolen cars, Russian mobsters, a spoiled son who doesn't have half the restraint and judgment of dad precisely because dad spoiled him, and lots of blood. We should stop criticizing the millennials so much, because all we've bequeathed to them is 100K of student debt each for four year degrees that don't get them jobs and films like this. Kudos to the effects team, because they did good work. They are the only reason this film gets even four stars.",4,2,3,8 June 2019
A Star Is Born," An OK rendition of a tired story...
","... it is so tired it dates back to 1932. The first rendition was 'What Price Hollywood' starring Constance Bennett as a woman who is looking for fame in the movies and Lowell Sherman as a director with a drinking and punctuality problem who discovers her while he still has some clout. In this version the starlet's husband is a sound citizen. The second version is from 1937 and stars Janet Gaynor in one of her last roles before her retirement as the country gal who comes to Hollywood seeking stardom. In this version it is the starlet's future husband (Fredric March) who discovers her and whose career goes downhill due to alcohol. In 1954 Judy Garland plays the actress on an uphill trajectory with James Mason as the matinee idol husband who is on a downhill slide. What is different here? Due to the actress playing the lead role, the star is made to be a great singer too so full advantage can be taken of Garland's voice. Why make a 1976 version? In this case both the woman on the rise/husband on the decline are singers exclusively. The movies have exited stage left. Also, this is the first post production code era version of the film, so you have sleeping around before marriage, graphic infidelity, drug addiction, and a close up view of the suicide scene.So now we have FOUR versions of this film. Why make a fifth? Because Hollywood is out of nerve. They want to go for the safe bet and safe buck. The plot for this fifth version is pretty close to the fourth. The differences I could see? The husband does not accidentally hit the wife during the award ceremony - if it's not PC it's not going to be in an American film. And finding the future singing sensation in a drag bar - not even in the post production code era would that have gone over in 1976. That's pretty much it. Oh, and therapists get involved in this one. Got to have therapists in these situations now, they are the priests of 21st century America. Other than that, no difference. Everybody carries themselves believably, nobody makes a fool of themself, but other than that - meh. Oh, one more thing. There is zero chemistry between the two leads - zilch, zip, nada. There was chemistry between each of the leads of all of the ones that came before it except for the 1932 film, and that was because the starlet's husband may have been a sober guy, but he was a bit of a caveman in how he treated his wife.My final verdict - for what they charge for going to the movies these days I would expect more. You want music in your film? Go see Bohemian Rhapsody. That tells a story worth telling mainly because it is a biography so the script was pretty much already written. Just my two cents.",5,15,31,18 November 2018
The Death of Stalin," How difficult to make a parody built around the death of one of the worst men to ever live...
","... and yet this film does just that. It revolves around the power struggle that occurs at the death of Stalin in 1953, a man who had an iron grip on Russia for 30 years and enforced his will with terror, often randomly.So when the sycophants who surround him are suddenly bereft of his soul, they are all jockeying for power while finding it very difficult to do the one thing that would get you tortured and killed as long as they can remember - independent thinking, or even making suggestions for that matter. A simple show of hands vote becomes a hilarious demonstration of group think. They all have a collective case of Stockholm Syndrome when it comes to Stalin, still afraid of a man who is dead.Jeffrey Tambor is doing his character Hank from the 90s sitcom 'The Larry Sanders Show', and Steve Buschemi, as Nikita Khrushchev, doesn't look like any picture of Khrushchev that I ever saw at any point in his life. Plus he's basically doing his 'funny looking guy' schtick from Fargo, and yet it all works.When Lavrenti Beria, head of the secret police and probably responsible for untold terrors, gently tells Stalin's daughter that she needs to leave Russia because people who are strange like she is don't live very long, it is practically a sweet intimate moment that runs counter to everything we know about the guy.This is a bleak yet hilarious comedy built around real events. I'd highly recommend it.",8,29,33,2 November 2019
Citizen Kane," Where do I begin?...
","and how do I end a review of this film? Well bear with me while I try.Why is Citizen Kane a great film and yet so hard to review? Because it is like a big ball of yarn with the ends of many threads sticking out. You can just yank on any thread, start writing, and go on forever. Let me start with its style, which is discussed in great detail in the late Roger Ebert's excellent commentary on the DVD of the film. Its unusual photography, editing, scene transitions, etc. are why it is shown in film school.For example, the lap dissolves in the scene with Joseph Cotten in the old-folks home were very unusual. The scene of Cotten talking dissolves into a flashback scene with Kane, and half-way through the dissolve, we see Cotton on the left side of the screen and the Kane flashback on the right side, and that is held for several seconds. It is a dissolve into a split screen by means of very clever lighting. The lights fade out on the right side of the Cotten scene, and they fade up on the right side of the Kane scene. That technique had never been done before, and I've seen it in only one or two movies made after that.Then there is the story, the theme of which seems to be uttered by the reporters near the end of the film, as they give up searching for the meaning of Kane's last word - 'Rosebud'. They say Kane was a man who, though one of the wealthiest men in the world ,lost everything he ever had, even though he died rich. And so the story we have been watching is, on the surface, just that. The final scene showing you Kane's possessions that are considered of no value by auditors being tossed into the flames of an incinerator - one happening to be a sled with the name 'Rosebud' on it, the sled Kane was playing on the day he became a rich man - as a child through a quirk of fate.I used to be in the camp that believed that the snow globe was representational of Kane's nostalgia for his boyhood home and maybe for the sled. I no longer believe his attachment to the piece has anything to do with his pre-wealth youth. I think it reminds him of a time much later than that. That snow globe actually was a possession belonging to Susan Alexander before Kane ever met her, sitting on her dressing table in her small apartment. Kane picked up the globe during his rampage in her bedroom in Xanadu when she left him. Holding that globe abruptly put an end to his destruction of her bedroom. Why? I think it links back to the evening when they met and Alexander had no idea who he was. That night Charles Foster Kane was just a 'schoolboy' who could wiggle his ears and do shadow puppets to impress a thoughtful and attractive young lady. This courtship was a period in their relationship that we can assume was not influenced by his money. For that one evening, he wasn't the richest man in the country. No other relationship that Kane had, once he was wrested from his sled as a child, began in that same manner. All the other people surrounding Kane as an adult were near him because of, or with full knowledge of, his wealth and power. Jed Leland was a friend from his college days. Mr. Bernstein was an employee. The first wife, who was met and courted on a buying tour of Europe, would know who Charles Foster Kane was when they met. Only Susan Alexander came into his life completely carefree of his wealth. And she brought with her that snow globe.While holding the snow globe as he lay dying, Kane isn't thinking about the cabin in Colorado or his sled - even if that is the scene depicted in the snow globe. (What an odd coincidence that she would own a snow globe with a cabin and sled in it when they met. That is a bigger 'huh?' than who heard Kane's last words.) Kane is thinking about this very personal artifact that belonged to Susan Alexander, the woman who, in spite of a toothache, offered some kind assistance to a stranger one night long ago.Why does Kane whisper 'Rosebud' on his death bead and not 'Susan.'? I don't know. Perhaps it is just where his mind wandered while reminiscing about that evening in a young woman's apartment when he was detoured from going to the warehouse that stored the artifacts of his youth.What are the other threads you could pull on and write paragraphs about? Kane's parents and why his mother did what she did, apparently never seeing her son again once she turned him over to be raised by bankers, somehow seeing this as an act of love. Then there is the issue of memory and how people are not what they seem to be - the apparent sycophant Mr. Bernstein seeming to have a great deal of wisdom and depth in his old age that you would not have foreseen when he was young - he talks about a girl he saw on a ferry 40 years before and how a day hasn't passed that he hasn't thought of her. How Kane liked being 'the voice and defender of the masses' but maybe didn't like the idea that maybe someday those masses would organize and demand their rights, as Jed Leland had said on his way out of Kane's life. And on it goes.I'm sorry if this review is a bit disorganized, but 'Citizen Kane' is not linear storytelling, or any other kind that I can identify with one word, yet it is storytelling at its best.",10,9,13,18 April 2016
Darkest Hour," I never tire of watching this!
","This biopic of a very narrow period in Winston Churchill's life - May 1940 to be exact - was probably made to earn British actor Gary Oldman the academy award, but man, did he ever earn it! This film won Oscars for Best Actor for Oldman and for makeup, and I'd say they definitely earned that. Great trouble is taken to make sure you believe you are looking right at Sir Winston. Oldman literally disappears into the part.The film opens with Parliament in open rebellion over Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's failure to deal with Hitler and the opposition party demanding his resignation. Chamberlain wants Halifax to replace him, another appeasement advocate cut from the same cloth as he, but Halifax refuses saying his 'time has not yet come'. So Winston's party picks him literally - while holding their noses - because nobody else wants the job. And for good reason. Hitler is knocking over European countries with the ease of dominoes and the entire British army is trapped at Dunkirk, with so many damaged ships blocking the harbor that no other ship can get into it to rescue them.Next we meet Oldman's portrayal of Sir Winston. He is a man of enormous appetites - food, drink, cigars - and sometimes tremendous temper. His spending brings him to the brink of bankruptcy multiple times. His party doesn't like him. The king resents him for how he advised his brother when he was planning to marry Wallis Simpson. And Chamberlain and Halifax STILL want to appease Hitler and because Churchill does not, they are working to undermine him, particularly with the king. The film uses two obvious plot devices that are probably not based in fact. One is Churchill's young secretary who at first he scares to death with his tantrums, but later the two become close as he softens his approach with her . The other is a trip into a subway to get 'the man on the street's opinion' about Hitler that just seems eye-rollingly over the top. There is a baby that the mother oddly says looks like Churchill, what seems like an interracial couple in 1940, and a woman who, from the way she is dressed, appears to be a socialist. Yet they to a man, to a woman, to a child, encourage Churchill to fight Hitler to the end. This fictitious event seems to be stolen from Shakespeare, but if you must steal, then steal from the best.Honorable mention has to go to Kristen Scott Thomas as Clementine, Winston's supportive wife who is often overlooked by history. Also deserving mention is Ben Mendelsohn as King George VI, who is portraying a man much more comfortable as monarch than he was portrayed in Then King's Speech, but then this is not his story. Yes, it is not historically accurate, but if Churchill did confront the situations and people he confronted in this film, he probably would have acted exactly as he was portrayed here. I knock off one star for not at least TRYING to explain to the audience WHY - with Hitler obviously not trustworthy - members of Parliament would not realize the choice was between slavery and war. The answer is that WWI cost Britain a generation of young men. Literally every British young man who went to war either died or was maimed. And in the end the entire conflict seemed like it had been for nothing. And so many of the British - and more of the Americans - did not want to go through this a second time with the exact same country, not realizing until it was almost too late that the Kaiser was no Hitler.",9,10,14,26 August 2018
Monster," How can you show any humanity if nobody has ever shown you any?
","This film starts just as homeless prostitute Aileen Wuornos is going to kill herself with a gun she ironically keeps for protection, but first she wants to buy a drink with the few dollars she has left in her pockets because she doesn't want anybody to get for free what she worked so hard to get. So she goes down the hill to a gay bar to get her last drink where she meets Selby. Selby is sexually attracted to Aileen, who at first gives her a fierce rebuff. But then Selby tells her a little about her story - how her family is trying to 'reform her' from being gay - and Aileen accepts at least some friendship from her, and changes her mind about suicide.The friendship grows to mutual sexual attraction, and Aileen and Selby run off and move into a motel. Aileen intends to go straight, dresses up for interviews, and gets turned down by everyone. Selby's affection turns to impatience and ultimately angry manipulation as she uses Aileen's attachment to her to get her to go back into prostitution so that they can go out and have a good time. Aileen ultimately gives in, and that's when she meets up with convicted rapist Richard Mallory, whom she claimed to kill in self defense. That is the scenario the movie shows. From that point forward something in Aileen just snaps and she sees every john as a rapist worthy of death, even the ones she had to cajole into accepting her services using sob stories of fictitious hungry children.The movie is grim and if you read the headlines at all during the late 80s and early 90s you know the story, but just let me say that for once the Academy got it right by giving Charlize Theron Best Actress Oscar. If you've ever seen the actual Aileen Wuornos captured on film, somehow the beautiful Theron got her down even to the wild look she'd get in her eyes - the look of an animal caged.The movie didn't go too much into the real Aileen Wuornos' past, but all I can say is that she never had a chance given what I read. Born to a teenage girl and a schizophrenic criminal father, abandoned to be raised by grandparents who didn't want to be burdened with her or her brother, and then thrown out of the house by her grandfather after her grandmother's death when she was 15, nobody ever treated her like a human being. I'd like to think the title of this film - Monster - is the ultimate in sarcasm, because what else could Aileeen Wuornos ever have become but a monster given that all she had ever known from other human beings was monstrous treatment.Highly recommended but very depressing.",8,20,21,17 February 2015
The Birth of a Nation," Great techniques and a horrible message...
","...yet I still give it an 8/10 for all of the ground that it broke. When it was released in 1915, the Hollywood movie industry was still in its infancy as movie makers such as DeMille had only been there about a year or so. Most movies were made on the East coast and used artificial lighting which often gave the films a very flat look.Most filmmakers would film outside until the late afternoon and then close up shop. Griffith however liked to use lighting just as the sun was going down as it gave everything a soft glow. These scenes looked better than anything you could have achieved in a set with artificial lighting in those days. The battles scenes also looked very good, like a lot of care was taken to set them up and make them as realistic as possible. This kind of an epic was rare for the times and must have surprised most movie goes who were more used to short films that were often shot on sets with artificial lighting. Some of the innovations of BOAN (it should be noted that while Griffith didn't originate all of the techniques used in BOAN, he was the first to integrate them all so seamlessly in a feature-length film) included night-time photography-Billy Bitzer achieved by firing magnesium flares into the night for the split-screen sequence of the sacking of Atlanta, being the first film to have an original score, the first film to employ hundreds of extras for the battle scenes, flashbacks and parallel editing, and extensive use of close-ups, long shots, dissolves, etc. to heighten the impact of the story.It's not fair to other films and filmmakers to say this film and this film alone changed movie history but it's definitely on the short list of films that did along with DeMille's 'Squaw Man' released the previous year which is remembered as Hollywood's first feature length film, even though it is not. That honor goes to Helen Gardner's 'Cleopatra' made in 1912.Then there are the features of the story that give this film a well-deserved bad rap for having revived the KKK. ' There is the Austin Stoneman character who is biracial and wants to rule the South with an iron fist. He sets himself up as some kind of alternate President during reconstruction. Where was the real president, Andrew Johnson? Locked in a broom closet? This character was supposed to be a thinly veiled caricature of Thaddeus Stevens. Since white Confederates have their civil rights suspended during this time, the state houses of the south are shown packed with the absolutely worst stereotypes of black men, with them eating, drinking liquor, and taking their shoes off and putting their feet on their desks during the chaotic legislative sessions. They are also shown as sex-mad for Caucasian females, the biracial Austin Stoneman included. Let's just say that the story is as subtle as a sledge hammer, but when you realize that its contemporaries considered a guy in a cape with a long mustache tying virgins to railroad tracks to be high drama, the actual message of BOAN may be hogwash, but the complexity of the story telling and the sophistication of the acting is to be admired. That's why I recommend it in spite of the point of view of the script. Sorry for the long review, but a long film often requires one.",8,23,39,30 July 2016
12 Angry Men," A timeless film that shows the flaws in the jury system
","... the main flaw being that everybody brings their own life experiences and history into the jury room with them, no matter how hard they try to be impartial.Here you have a trial of a young boy who supposedly stabbed his father to death. When the jurors go back to deliberate on the case, ALL but one lone man played with a quiet courage by Henry Fonda states not guilty and the rest of the film is about trying to get them to his side. Quite amazing movie if you ask me. Fonda's case is not that the boy is innocent, but that the threshold of reasonable doubt has not been reached. The trick in this film is that it never leaves the jury room. You have no idea of what the defendant, the prosecuting attorney, or the defense attorney were like other than retroactively through the words of the jurors.Writing this good just can't be ignored. Reginald Rose's screenplay is absolutely brilliant. Not only are the characters of twelve individuals indelibly implanted in your brain within the limited time span of about 100 minutes, but Rose accomplishes this feat without undue speechifying or pontificating about injustice or the failures of the jury system or expositional dialogue. The characters personalities come out in the course of the film and are not 'set up' in the first half hour, (as in having the jurors explain to each other what their occupations and backgrounds are) as is the case with mediocre screenplays. As for the acting it is true ensemble greatness. All twelve cast members are excellent, although if you put a gun to my head and forced me to say who was best I'd express a partiality for Lee J Cobb as the toughest nut to crack for acquittal and E.G. Marshall as a juror who is all logic and no emotion other than arrogance. And Sidney Lumet's first film just may be his most fast paced. The hundred minutes whiz by! Not a dull stretch to be seen anywhere.And yes, these are twelve white men judging a Puerto Rican boy, and yes Henry Fonda violated many classic rules of jury behavior when he introduced items into the discussion that were not official evidence, but this was 60 years ago and it IS a movie. So just suspend your beliefs and try to enjoy the art of the thing -the riveting dialogue, the character studies that don't choke each other out, and the brilliant camera-work that manages to make the room seem increasingly smaller so that you can appreciate the claustrophobia that must be setting in with the jurors as deliberations wear on and get more heated.",9,12,19,19 February 2017
Elizabeth," What does this film and Yankee Doodle Dandy have in common?
","They are both great films that take so much liberty with the truth that I doubt the real people upon which they are based would recognize their own lives! We'll never know about Queen Elizabeth I who died 400 years before the motion picture was born, but George M. Cohen, whose life is on display in Yankee Doodle Dandy, did screen the picture before release and his comment was - 'Great film, who is it about?'. But I digress.Cate Blanchett is every inch a queen in this film. Elizabeth surely was in danger during her half sister Mary's rule who wasn't called 'Bloody Mary' for nothing. Robert Dudley was the love of Elizabeth's life, and she likely didn't marry for good reason, especially if you look at what happened to her cousin Mary Queen of Scots, who lost her throne by becoming vulnerable through affairs and marriages of the heart. Dudley's first wife did die conveniently in 1560, leaving him free to marry Elizabeth if she had so wanted. But tongues wagged about the suspicious manner of Robert's first wife's death, as she died by falling down a flight of stairs. Dudley did remain a loyal friend to Elizabeth throughout the rest of his life, angering the queen when he married a second time in secret after waiting twenty years for Elizabeth. But life must go on right? But this last paragraph is largely the truth, now for the movie. In this film Robert Dudley is still first in Elizabeth's heart, and he is shown to be a two faced horndog unworthy of that affection. Her biggest threat is shown to be Mary of Guise, French born and Catholic ruler of Scotland who plays this role completely over the top, but is delightful nonetheless. She is taken down in a James Bond style operation by Walsingham, trusted adviser and head of a network of international spies who is not against getting his hands dirty himself. Walsingham was indeed a trusted adviser, although years later than shown, and Geoffrey Rush plays this part to perfection, although the actual Walsingham was not nearly as interesting as the character shown here. In fact Walsingham was only a year older than Elizabeth, and a happily married homebody. I think they gave the part to an actor in middle age so that he looked as experienced as he seemed. The cross dressing Duke of Anjou never came to England and never sought Elizabeth's hand, but it makes for a great theater.Then there is William Cecil, played by Richard Attenborough, whose heart is in the right place - as in for England and for Elizabeth - but has ideas that constrain England as a second hand power looking to France or Spain for protection. Elizabeth retires him with honors in the film and looks more and more to Walsingham. In fact, Cecil was only 13 years Elizabeth's senior, not a very old man as shown here. Elizabeth never retired him. Only death did that, and then only less than five years before her own.So enjoy the great acting, the perfect art direction and cinematography, the intrigue and the plots, and a...poisoned dress? But most of all enjoy Cate Blanchett's performance as she portrays Elizabeth as she evolves from a young girl uncertain of what to say before parliament to the point where she practices her speeches haltingly in private, into an iron maiden who shears her hair, wears a wig, and paints herself with lead in an attempt to become a symbol of power, not the woman who has been looked upon as vulnerable to plots both at home and abroad. She gives up all hopes of personal happiness to be secure on her throne to tend to her first love, England, with all of this happening in a very compressed time period compared to what really happened, if it happened at all.",8,1,1,28 February 2017
The Irishman," Somewhat like Goodfellas - Reprise
","Scorsese is never going to match that film in my opinion. It was the pinnacle of his career. The soundtrack, pace, edittng, acting were all just marvelous. And it gave you a look into the mob from 'the working mobster's' point of view that made all similar mob movies look like garbage, before and after.The Irishman is definitely worth your time, telling the story of mobster Frank Sheeran (De Niro) from his point of view, as he talks about how he befriended and ultimately executed James Hoffa. Realize that this is an unproven theory based on Sheeran's deathbed confession. Of course, how are you going to lose when Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci reunite with Scorsese. I'm not sure Pacino has ever worked with Scorsese before, but he's the pro he always was as Jimmy Hoffa.Since Pesci has been retired from acting for twenty years, the thing that struck me was how OLD he looked. It is actually jarring. He plays De Niro's brother in 'Raging Bull', and a protege a generation younger than him in 'Goodfellas', but here he is his elder! And then I look it up and Pesci is actually De Niro's age! So, leaving all of that aside, you get the great performances you'd expect, and the intimate viewpoint and story will hold your interest through the long running time. It is just very similar to Goodfellas in technique, and that is not a bad thing except it seemed like I had seen this film before.The one unique thing about it? You get to see these mobsters as they get to very old age and have a chance to reflect and maybe have some regrets. In Goodfellas, the main character is in his late 30s when circumstances force him out of the mob.I'd recommend it if you have ever liked anything that the actors or that Scorsese have done before.",7,7,12,14 December 2019
Creed," Stallone deserves an Oscar
","I can say with all seriousness that Sylvester Stallone deserves his Oscar, and I didn't believe that the original and rather obvious 'Rocky' deserved Best Picture Oscar, so I'm not some fan blind to the weaknesses of the series . He was excellent in that film. While some can argue that the Oscar would be a reward for the entirety of the Rocky franchise, I think that Stallone's performance in Creed stands on its own and is wholly deserving of any accolades he receives. His performance of an aging Rocky Balboa coming to terms with his own mortality (and the mortality of his loved ones, like Pauly and Adrian) and dealing with the effects of aging and the realization that he cannot partake in the rigorous boxing world anymore is very heartbreaking and compelling. Without providing any spoilers, the scene in which Adonis Creed and Rocky return to the famous steps from the first Rocky is a very poignant scene.",8,9,13,31 January 2016
That Thing You Do!," Breezy period piece wrapped around a catchy song
","When I saw this movie advertised in the theaters back in 1996, I rolled my eyes in great disdain. For one thing the advertising banner - 'In every life there comes a time when that dream you dream becomes that thing you do' hit me the wrong way. After all, 95% of us never wind up doing the dream we dream...there is no WHEN in our lives for this event. Plus, I just figured it was an attempt by Tom Hanks to go highbrow via a directorial debut after those back-to-back Academy Awards.When I finally got around to seeing the film I really loved it. The first half is very upbeat as the band gets started out. They truly are the 'One-ders', just like many other bands of the Beatles' transitional era. They wrote and performed one song that got them national attention, and then couldn't follow up with anything else. That's too bad, because the band does get one lucky break after another at the start. The guy in the camper that shoves a bowl of stew and a contract in front of them and tells them to 'trust me' could have had them signing anything. They got lucky that he was legitimate and really did intend to get the record on the air and not steal it from them. That's what makes the disintegration of the band at the end so sad. One by one, they just walk away from their dream. To me, if the movie had any flaw, it was this - the band members just acted like the whole thing was one big amusement park ride rather than a once-in-a-lifetime life changing opportunity.Finally, I also loved all of the authentic looking stage designs. The home appliance store really brought back memories. These type of family owned appliance stores were all over the place back in the 1960's before the big box stores gradually made them extinct. Plus, the appliances being sold looked just like what was available in 1964 right down to the brand names and the styles.",7,6,8,19 October 2010
Brokeback Mountain," This tragic and powerful love story will haunt you
","This film is about love lost for the sake of keeping up appearances that, in the end, just makes everyone involved miserable. Ennis and Jack are two young men who spend the summer of 1963 herding sheep in Wyoming on an isolated mountain. Ennis is the strong silent type in the Gary Cooper tradition, while Jack is more outgoing. During the two months they are together they become friends and then lovers. Had the time and place been different, they would have probably stayed together, based on the powerful scene in which they go their separate ways after that first summer. However, with the culture being that of the rugged mountain west and the time that of the early sixties, this was an impossibility. The reaction of their boss and Ennis' wife when they discover what is going on tells you what they could have looked forward to if they had been open about their relationship - muted ostracism by daylight, perhaps violence come nightfall. At first, the two just try to put their feelings for each other behind them. Ennis, already engaged, goes through with his marriage as planned and fathers two daughters. Jack goes back to Texas, meets and marries the daughter of a wealthy farm equipment dealer, and fathers a son. Four years after their initial separation, Jack returns to Wyoming and their relationship picks up where it left off - still a secret, this time on the pretext of week-long 'fishing trips' they take two or three times a year for the next fifteen years, never able to tell anyone about their love, never able to show their affection in public. Many have mentioned that the two were just cheating on their wives all of this time, but the fact is if they had been able to follow their hearts, they would have never had wives to begin with.Much of what is great about this film is what is left unsaid. Is Ennis actually homosexual or did he just fall in love with someone who happened to be a man? Did Jack die the way his wife said he did or he way Ennis imagined? Did Jack lie to Ennis that last time they were together and say he was having an affair with a woman because he knew Ennis would be jealous of another man but not another woman? Did Jack deliberately take Ennis' shirt as a reminder of him that first summer or did he just find it and decide to keep it? The acting is tremendous, and I find myself mourning the tragedy of the characters in this film as though they were real people, although I'm sure their situation represents many real ones past and present. This is a beautiful and thoughtful film that definitely should have won the Best Picture Oscar. Jack and Ennis' double lives just leave themselves, their wives, and everyone else who is close to them feeling empty and just add up to time and opportunity lost. Only the unwritten rules of society and conformity come out the winner in this one.",9,3,3,27 March 2013
Ed Wood," Every artist's professional nightmare
","Anyone who considers himself/herself to be a creator of any kind - inventor, musician, artist, writer - will consider this movie to be their worst professional nightmare. Imagine yourself dedicated to your craft, day after day and year after year putting out what you consider to be your best work in a field that you love only to find, at the end of your life, that you have failed in every way measurable and imaginable. This is essentially the story of director Edward D. Wood, Jr. 1924-1978, who was voted the worst director in the history of film in 1980, and as a result saw a renewed interest in his films that persists even today.Johnny Depp gives a great performance as Ed Wood as he was in the 1950's, starting with his friendship with Bela Lugosi and ending with the premiere of his best remembered film 'Plan Nine from Outer Space' and his elopement with Kathy, who remained his wife for twenty years until his death. At this point in his life Ed's enthusiasm for his work is irrepressible. Fortunately the film ends before he descends into frustration, alcoholism, and a series of skin flicks in the 60's. The genuine friendship between Lugosi (Martin Landau) and Wood is one of the more touching parts of the film. The men settle into almost a father/son relationship with a real mutual professional admiration. Lugosi supplies Ed with a star with which he can attract investors in his films, and Wood supplies Lugosi with work and a reason to go on living. Landau's portrayal of Lugosi is phenomenal. At times you forget that you really are not watching Lugosi himself.",10,5,6,21 November 2009
The Hustler," A film at a crossroads
","This film is at the crossroads of the more cinema verite style that would become increasingly common in the '60s with one foot still in the past - some of the dialogue still strikes me as the kind of speechifying one would see in an older movie. I pass no judgment; I like both styles, but having both in one movie makes for a slightly uneven mix. Paul Newman I tended to find a little too theatrical and stagey at this stage in his career, though he has charisma coming out the ears. He does that same cracking himself up with some private joke laugh that he does in Cool Hand Luke. He only really became a great actor in the 70s or even the 80s, in my opinion. You're not 15 minutes into the movie before a Fast Eddie-Minnesota Fats showdown is underway. There's sort of an emotional letdown after the intensity of that early highpoint.George C. Scott is electric. He really hit the ground running, nabbing Supporting Actor noms for Anatomy of a Murder and this film early in his career. But the story arc of poor Piper Laurie makes this film a tough and slightly unpleasant watch, as good as she is. Watching this film again helps give some resonance to the sequel The Color of Money, which I also saw again recently, in which Newman's Eddie (and anyone who's seen the original film) can see many of the same traits in the Tom Cruise character that he himself had in the first movie.Oh, and special mention of Myron McCormick, who plays Fast Eddie's first manager, whom I've just learned about by reading that new book about Henry Fonda and Jimmy Stewart. During the Depression, McCormick shared a one-bedroom apartment with Fonda, Stewart and Josh Logan in Manhattan and was the only one of the four getting steady work, in radio. He had his two highest-profile roles at the very end of his career: this film and No Time for Sergeants. Unfortunately, he was dead at the age of 54 only a year after making this movie.",8,0,0,2 March 2019
Spotlight," Solid yet I think the subject matter was what got it nominated for Best Picture
","The opening is flat and not well paced. It came to life ten or fifteen minutes in with the first appearance of Billy Crudup as the trial lawyer Eric Macleish, who gave this film a much-needed jolt of energy.Fortunately, the film does build, and the more the story unfolds, the more gripping it becomes, and seemingly, Tom McCarthy's direction improves, too. The performances are all very good, the writing is solid, and the production design is admirable. I don't see Mark Ruffalo's work as Oscar-worthy, which is not to knock it. I thoroughly appreciate the way the performances are underplayed--a performance cannot be more underplayed than Liev Schreiber's, yet that seems right for a character who never shows his cards. It's easy to imagine an approach that has all the reporters emoting heavily as they come to realize the horror of the situation.Michael Keaton as Walter Robinson, John Slattery as Ben Bradlee, Billy Crudup as Macleish, Stanley Tucci as Garabidian, Jamey Sheridan as Sullivan, and Len Cariou as Cardinal Law are all outstanding, as are others I'm probably forgetting to mention. The minor parts are cast with actors with faces who look like they belong in Boston, such as Rachel McAdams' grandmother or the woman who plays the priest's sister.The story is so compelling that I was very glad I had seen it, though a crispness of approach from the beginning, establishing characters from the get-go, would have made the movie even better.",7,0,0,31 January 2016
Aquaman," The whole movie felt loud and relentless and so long
","There was embarrassing writing, embarrassing acting, and listening to Amber Heard trying to deliver this terrible dialogue with zero inflection was exhausting. Why does half of the population of Atlantis sound like they're from California? The dialogue was never more than cliche with a predictable plot. The 'advanced ancient civilization hidden away from the world' trope is already old. There was so much CGI that none of the action ever felt impressive or tense or real. Any time someone said 'Ocean Master' with a straight face I wanted to laugh.This would've been the perfect movie to not take itself too seriously, go for a more lighthearted and irreverent tone like Thor Ragnarok, but they just try so hard. It has none of the superhero charm that Marvel manages to carry over from the comics and thus you have one very long boring slog.How many scenes did we need where a quiet moment was interrupted by an exploding wall that didn't hurt anybody? I counted three or four. Also, that paint-by-numbers forced romance - 'Wow there was a surprise and now we're accidentally holding hands', 'Wow there was an explosion or something and I grabbed you ' - give me a break. And whoever put together the soundtrack for this film should be summarily executed.",5,12,21,5 January 2019
The Prestige," Does anybody look better in a top hat and tails than Hugh Jackman?...
","... but I guess that is really beside the point.Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play two young British magicians - Alfred Borden and Robert Angier - trying to learn the tricks of the trade, somewhat even allied at first. Borden is a common Londoner, but Angier is to the manor born, using an alias in his magic work so as to not to embarrass his rich Victorian family. In the pursuit of a more fantastic trick a terrible accident occurs and Angier loses somebody close to him, vowing revenge against Borden, whom he holds responsible.These two are both the Roadrunner and Wiley Coyote to one another. Each one tries to sabotage and learn the other's tricks, make each other look
ridiculous, etc. Angier is the more dangerous of the two because he is truly intent on killing Borden when he infiltrates his 'catch the bullet' act early on in the film and, instead, maims him. The rivalry ratchets up
to increasingly dangerous proportions. It is ultimately a fine piece of drama as to how far these two are willing to go in their obsession and for their art, with them both ultimately living tragic and miserable lives in the process. So much sacrifice for what most people would consider a trivial pastime. It is madness beyond obsession.This is a very entertaining and thought provoking film, and there is plenty of foreshadowing. Watch closely and watch it twice. I honestly don't think Christopher Nolan would be capable of linear storytelling if his life depended on it, but he is a master of this adapted material. At the end I could only go - 'Brilliant'.Scarlett Johannson plays Angier's lover who has a pivotal role in how the final act plays out. Rebecca Hall is Sarah, Borden's wife, who can't figure out why her husband seems to only love her on some days. David Bowie lends a real air of mystery to his portrayal of Nikola Tesla. But who else but Bowie could believably introduce his character by walking through lightning? Yes, the Tesla-Edison feud gets incorporated into the film and even a sci-fi angle is thrown into the plot. Michael Caine, as Jackman's magician mentor, seems to be playing his Alfred character from The Dark Knight. He has a supporting role, but watch him carefully, he has some of the most important lines of the film. And his final decision - do you think it was correct? Did two wrongs make a right in this unique situation?I wish I could tell you more, but I would give away the plot if I did. This is truly one of the better films made in the 21st century, and I largely don't like films made after 1960. Highly recommended and a real head scratcher, especially given the last line of the film.",10,11,14,10 February 2019
Sleepy Hollow," Excels as a Gothic exercise in atmosphere and dark humor
","Director Tim Burton's elaborate take on Washington Irving's tale of Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman doesn't have much in common with Irving but excels as a Gothic exercise in atmosphere and dark humor.This rich visual feast demands a viewer's attention with its stunning photography and art direction, with countless memorably framed shots of 18th Century New York, with its foggy woods and small town cobblestone streets. Lurking about, too, of course, is the legendary Headless Horseman who seems to be collecting an increasingly large number of heads of his hapless victims.This brings about the arrival of Crane, transformed by Burton from Disney's spindly school teacher of animation fame into an analytical would be Sherlock Holmes type detective. Only this detective is decidedly squeamish about blood (not to mention spiders) and, on at least one bloody occasion, will pass out. The role is an ideal showcase for Johnny Depp, whose Crane is both darkly handsome and a bit prissy. Depp is truly endearing in his part, an engagingly idiosyncratic individual who will eventually turn reluctant hero.None of the rest of the cast, while capable, make much of an impression next to Depp. A few old timers occupy that cast, however, including Christopher Lee, Michael Gough and Martin Landau. However, Christopher Walken also appears, chillingly, in a significant role.It's a shame, of course, that Burton's skills with narrative story telling are not nearly as effective as his flair for visual dramatics (as unquestionably impressive as the latter are here) and, as far as the story itself is concerned, the film is confused and falls a bit flat. Nor are the horror elements of the story all that horrifying, though this is a film in which the decapitations by the Horseman will keep the heads a rolling. Burton largely treats these moments of bloodshed and 'terror' as darkly humorous more than anything else.More than any of the special effects involving the Headless Horseman, what stays with me are Depp's performance and, particularly, the Gothic elegance of this production. That alone makes Sleepy Hollow well with the investment of a viewer's time.",8,10,14,21 April 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Probably one of my favorite Marvel films
","This Spider-Man movie is the first Spider-Man movie in the Marvel canon. The prior two Spider-Man franchises are irrelevant to this series. Spider-Man, introduced in Captain America: Civil War, is part of the final phase of the Marvel Universe leading up to Avengers: The Infinity War. Marvel wisely opted to skip the origin story of Spider-Man and instead, framed this film to be more of a coming of age tale for Peter Parker (Tom Holland) and his quest to become part of the Avengers. Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) is tasked with taking Peter under his wing. Of course, Peter only sees the glory of being a superhero and ends up taking on situations that are too big for him to handle on his own. He has to be bailed out by Iron Man on a couple different occasions. Peter seems to think that wearing the suit with all of its gadgets and fancy technology will bring him the tools he needs to be like idols Iron Man and Captain America--not realizing that there is much more too it than just fancy tools. One very poignant moment has Peter telling Tony that he is 'nothing without the (spider-Man) suit.' To which Tony responds very bluntly, 'then you don't deserve to wear the suit.' Tony is waiting for Peter to show something emotionally and mentally that proves to Tony and the rest of the Avengers that he has what it takes to be a viable member of the team.Much of the film involves Peter trying to figure out what it means to be Spider-Man. It's more than just foiling bank robberies by wrapping people up in his web. He's also trying to figure out who he is. Feeling like he's wasting his time in high school, he struggles to make friends and to fit in with his peers. He faces many of the normal issues that teenagers - especially ones that are unique- face such as bullying, crushing on a girl who seems out of his league, trying to juggle academics with outside commitments, and so on.Michael Keaton portrays 'Vulture,' the villain whom Peter encounters. Vulture is somewhat sympathetic as he seems more like someone who always gets the short end of the stick and is just trying to get a piece of the pie. But of course, he takes it too far.Others in the cast involve: Marisa Tomei as Peter Parker's Aunt May; Gwyneth Paltrow appears as Pepper Potts, Tony Stark's assistant/girlfriend; Chris Evans reprises his role as Captain America appearing in educational PSA videos that Peter ends up watching during school; John Favreau reprises his role as Happy Hogan, head of security for the Avengers; and Disney star Zendaya plays one of Peter's classmates.",8,5,7,8 December 2018
The Beach," After 16 years I just recently saw this...
","... and I thought it was a pretty good film. When it first came out it was DiCaprio's presence that caused me not to watch it, and after watching him grow as an actor over the last 15 years, DiCaprio is what got me curious enough to give it a try.DiCaprio plays Richard, a tourist who hates the tourist traps he can afford in Thailand. A guy in Richard's hotel named Daffy -for appropriate reasons - kills himself, but first draws a map to an island that he claims is nirvana. Richard convinces two French tourists to come with him and they actually do find a colony of people living outside of any civilization other than the one they have built for their own survival and pleasure. The leader is Sal (Tilda Swinton) who tells the three that the drug dealers who control the island allow them to stay there but have said there can be no more people joining them - it hurts their chances at having their thriving cannabis business remain undiscovered. Sal says that they can stay, but is bothered by the map, burns it, and asks if they gave a copy to anyone else. Richard lies and says no - he gave it to a group of stoners he met before they got there. Whether they are on their way there or are too drug addled to make the trip, Richard does not know. So he figures the lie will hurt nobody.This is basically an adult 'Lord of the Flies'. The lesson it teaches is that no matter where you go, unfortunately your human nature and all that comes with it hitches a ride. That is why Richard could easily see the evils of the city but it took some time for problems to arise at 'the beach'. It's just a matter of more humans in one place than another.And who would figure on a story in which armed drug dealers actually turn out to be the good guys, probably because they know the truth about human nature better than their nirvana seeking neighbors. To see what I mean, watch and find out.",7,12,19,11 December 2016
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," 36 years and 737 reviews later, what is new left to be said?...
","...Maybe my personal take? The original Star Wars (1977) was genre changing. The second Star Wars (1980) was an unexpected sequel, a blockbuster in every sense of the word. This third one....well, it made it easy to say goodbye for 16 years and to have lowered expectations when the prequels started arriving in 1999.It just takes itself too seriously. 'I know he's OK....I can feeeel it!'. Oh, brother. Talking about The Farce being with you. And no I did not just misspell that word. Obi Wan returns in spirit form to rewrite some history so Luke did not just get thrown over for Han Solo because girls just love the bad boys, but there is some reason and purpose behind it. 'So you told me a bunch of lies?' Luke asks his one time mentor. 'Well that depends upon what your definition of the word 'IS' is'...being the gist of how Obi Wan answers him.And we have a fairly meaningless chase through a rain forest, and the most commercial purposeless creature ever created in cinematic history up to that date - the Ewok. Be sure to ask for a miniature for your kids when you order a Big Mac and fries.I've been hard on Episode VI in light of how great IV and V were. I'm giving it a seven because compared to other films, that is what it is. Compared to its two predecessors it is probably a six. Compared to what Disney has done to the franchise, though, it is probably an eleven!",7,13,18,18 October 2019
Pan's Labyrinth," Truly the best film of 2006
","Pan's Labyrinth is a film about the role choice and blind obedience has in shaping the destinies of the individual as well as society. The film consists of two tales that are skillfully interwoven with the same twelve year old girl, Ofelia, at the center of each. One is a tale of life and rebellion in 1944 Spain under the Franco regime, the other tale involves a magical world in which the faun, Pan, oversees three tests that will allow Ofelia to claim her rightful place as princess in that magical world. At the beginning of the film both tales have little in common with one another other than the girl being at the center of each. However, as the film progresses, the magical world crosses over more and more into the real world. For example, the key, the dagger, and the monsters encountered in the magical world have definite analogs in the earthly realm.There is much that is left open for interpretation in this film. For example, until the end you are not sure if Pan is even telling the girl the truth. Is he actually leading her to a higher destiny, or does he just need someone to perform the three tasks in order to get something for himself? Why does Pan get younger and younger as the film progresses? Since Ofelia has a love of magical stories and nobody else actually sees any of the magical occurrences, are they real or just ways for the girl to escape her increasingly sad situation and environment? Most of the characters in the 'real world' part of the film, however, are completely unambiguous. Ofelia's stepfather, Captain Vidal, is the most shining example. From the beginning he plays a man devoted to detail, to the extinction of the rebels, and to his own legacy. He seems to have no human feelings and is as made of stone as the labyrinth that inhabits his property. This is made clear early in the film by a violent scene in which two villagers that claim to be hunting rabbits are killed by Vidal as suspected rebels. When he later finds a rabbit in the mens' belongings that seems to confirm their story, his only reaction is that of irritation at his men for not more thoroughly searching the villagers before bothering him with the matter.If you enjoy tales of magic and fantasy in which everything is not sewed up into a tidy happy ending, and you appreciate how the visual aspect of film can contribute to the mood of various scenes, I strongly advise you check this movie out.",9,6,13,27 November 2009
The Best Years of Our Lives," What happened after the war
","This was one of the first films to explore what happened to those soldiers after the war, mainly because it was made the year after WWII was over. Plus it is one of the best of those films. Here we first meet three soldiers returning home, to the same hometown actually, and there their mutual history begins and ends. But even that trip back forms a kind of camaraderie where they want to keep in touch. There is banker Al Stephenson (Fredric March), a middle aged officer, sailor Homer Parrish (Harold Russell, a real amputee) who was the all American boy who excelled at sports and is engaged to the girl next door but now is missing both hands, and Dana Andrews as Fred Derry, a pilot who was just working in a drugstore before the war made him a temporary hero. This role for sure allowed Andrews to turn his stoic tight lipped image on its ear to a degree, as he was allowed to show the emotional wounds that can lie beneath the surface of a 'war hero' returning home.Their stories all intertwine, especially the story of Fred and Al. The thing that they have in common? Al's daughter, Peggy (Theresa Wright), who falls for Fred. The problem is Fred is married. A bigger problem is Fred was married during the war when he was a pilot with all of the glamour that comes with it to Marie (Virginia Mayo), who doesn't really know Fred at all, and for sure doesn't know him as the pre-war soda jerk who doesn't make enough post-War for her to enjoy the nightlife that she loves so much. As Marie holds Fred more and more in open contempt, Fred finds him turning more to Peggy.Meanwhile, Homer is trying to face facts. He cannot survive without the help of others. He cannot even get dressed and undressed without somebody's help. How can he marry the girl next door or anybody else without being a terrible burden? It doesn't help that the girl next door doesn't care about any of this, but Homer thinks she'll care later.March's character is probably the most fortunate and the least explained of the three returning soldiers. He was a banker when he left, and he goes back to that job, however, this time he is evaluating the loans of returning soldiers as the bank thinks he has their perspective given his time at war himself. Al seems to have a drinking problem which his wife (Myrna Loy) tries to hide, and it is never really said where that drinking is coming from, or if it was there before the war. When Al and his wife see each other, for the first time in years, you can see they don't know quite how to act around one another. Loy and March do a great job - without any dialogue - of acting like they feel like honeymooners, which they probably both feel is ridiculous since they have been married for twenty years and have a grown daughter.There is one scene that I found as quite a surprise, seeing I was born 13 years after the war. A guy at a drugstore diner counter basically says the war was all trumped up for corporate profits, and that it's a shame a guy like Homer paid the price. His remark is met by a punch by Fred. Although that attitude was more common during and after WWI, apparently it was held by a few people in regards to WWII in spite of the overwhelming evidence that our nation was at stake.I'd highly recommend this one. Even though some of the social attitudes have long passed on, it gives you some things to think about that are relevant to today. A spouse can change their attitude towards the other spouse due to a job loss, you never know if a marriage is really a bad one and on the rocks unless you are in that marriage or if it is over, and people are still judged by 'what have you done for me lately'.",8,2,3,8 November 2016
Tangled," A cute animated film from Disney
","I loved this movie. It is the story of Rapunzel, a princess with magic hair that has the ability to heal. Rapunzel was kidnapped as a child by an old woman who wanted to stay young. She kept Rapunzel captive in a tower in the middle of nowhere, where the two of them lived for 18 years. When the old woman would start experiencing the effects of aging, she'd ask Rapunzel to sing a special song while she brushed Rapunzel's hair. Rapunzel had to sing the same song each time to activate her special powers. Every year on Rapunzel's birthday, her parents, the King and Queen, release two lighted lanterns into the sky, hoping that Rapunzel would see them and come home. Eventually everyone in the kingdom began releasing the lanterns, creating a beautiful 'starry' sky. Rapunzel sees these glowing lights every year and wants to see the display in person. Enter Flynn Rider.Rider, a criminal, stumbles across Rapunzel's tower while on the run. He manages to climb inside the tower. Eventually after Rapunzel is understandably freaked out, she makes a deal with Rider: He must take her to the castle to see the lanterns released, and she will give back his satchel (that she's stolen and hidden) that contains the items he has stolen. Inevitably, the two fall in love and Rapunzel's 'mother' is upset that Rapunzel is gone and seeks out to find her.This was a great movie with fun characters and fun songs. My favorite part was when Flynn takes Rapunzel on a romantic boat ride so she can view the annual lantern display from the best spot in town. The scene is so gorgeous, accompanied by a romantic song. I'm a sucker for sweet romantic stories, even if they are animated. But none top Shrek.",9,0,0,5 July 2020
Interstellar," Good but a bit long
","This is a good sci-fi tale, if you can manage to sit for almost 3 hours, about a mission to save the planet from some disaster (either global warming, dust bowls, or whoever wins the next presidential election). Matthew McConaughey heads the mission, along with Anne Hathaway and a few others I hadn't seen before. They also have a neat robot named TARS. They fly off to find some previous scientists, who have entered a black hole and settled on several worlds possible for human habitation. Matt Damon plays one of the scientists.You have to like black holes, relativity, and the fifth dimension (not the pop group) to appreciate this. I didn't know a thing about this film beforehand, so it was a nice surprise to see Michael Caine pop up. And when William Devane showed up, I instinctively blurted out 'What's in your safe?'The special effects are fine, but the characters are more interesting, and you do want to see how the situations get resolved. McConaughey is good, but he mumbles on occasion, which drives me nuts. I liked the music score, but at times it drowned out the actors.",8,6,10,12 August 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," This film clearly displays this trilogy's biggest flaw...
","... which is that there was no overarching story to this trilogy planned.Say what you will about the prequels -years later they aren't considered secretly great or misunderstood. But they did one thing right. They expanded the universe of Star Wars with more world building and more lore, some good, some bad. The prequel story, while stilted, was the product of a single vision. In the end you had bad execution with good building blocks.The Sequel Trilogy doesn't expand anything, instead it makes everything smaller. Star Wars has never felt so small and tired as it does after The Rise of Skywalker. Each movie exists just to tear down and apologize for what came before it. Anakin/Vader's entire character arc is completely and unforgivably undermined after this film.Overall the movie was so bloated and overstuffed with choppy pacing to course-correct from The Last Jedi. It's Flanderization in action. The original movies had so many little touches and so much atmosphere and craftsmanship beyond a few big reveals, neat action set pieces, and bizarre coincidences with the same ten people running into one another over and over. The original films built iconic imagery and characters in the context of them doing things and bonding and building. This was not always perfectly done, but it was done well enough to feel meaningful.You can't just write a movie with the assumption you already have all of those things and skip the work it takes to get them. You can trick people for awhile by using the familiar imagery and beats and deconstructing the world with meta-humor (Abrams did that well for The Force Awakens if nothing else), but you just cash in that goodwill and cheapen all of that stuff by association.Oh well, the big action movies these days are indeed made for children and China - I can't remember who recently said that, but it's true.",5,1201,1917,22 December 2019
Pacific Rim," Did we all watch the same movie.....
","... or do I just have standards? Someone in the comment section said 'Is this the most stupid movie ever or what ...highly advanced alien civilization trying to invade earth using giant creatures that are cloned??? or give birth??? and much more stupid humans using giant robots to wrestle them'... and then he goes on to give some options and ask why it was done this way. I'll tell you why, original poster, because it is one way to get alien invaders, giant cloned creatures, and giant robots all into the same movie. This - and all big budget action pictures made today - are not about American audiences. They are about overseas audiences, where 75% of the money is made. Specifically, China and Russia. Thus you have minimal dialogue, big explosions, buxom scantily clad females, and muscular macho men who look like they came straight out of a porn movie with break-away clothing.How minimal is the dialogue? Well my husband watched this with one earphone on so he could hear the film, and one off so he could listen to me parodying the dialogue MST3K style by what I thought was going on just by the muted overacting. He stopped the film and took off the other headphone after awhile and said - 'to not be hearing anything that's being said you are remarkably spot on'. And this is exactly what the filmmakers are going for - something that you do not need to be an English speaker to follow.I did watch it later with dialogue or else I would not be able to write this review in good faith. I'm giving this a three just based on the work done on the sets. After all, production values wise, this is not an Ed Wood production. I shall now prepare to be pelted by eggs and tomatoes, most of them, I assume, coming from Russia and China.",3,5,6,28 September 2014
Corpse Bride," Good animation, but not one of Tim Burton's best
","I probably would have liked this movie more if I had not already seen - many times - 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' which was a brilliant and original piece of work. This movie does share some of that movie's qualities - haunting soundtrack, bumbling authority figures, a tall thin protagonist who is searching for something, a heroine whose limbs easily detach, and a dear departed house pet. It also has some interesting ideas of its own - the living looking and acting as though they were already dead, versus the dead living it up, since they have no more worries and forever to look forward to with the prospect of all of their loved ones returning to them one by one. In fact, the only time the living seem happy in this film is when the dead return to the land of the living for a truly unique wedding and instead of menacing or haunting the living, there are tearful and happy reunions. However, the individual characters in this film are just not that interesting.In short, even though all of the characters in 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' are dead, they just seem more alive and motivated than the characters in this film. Also, this movie is darker than 'Nightmare' and not as funny, so kids under 10 might find it too intense and probably not as interesting. Thus, although it is worthwhile viewing, I'm just afraid that Tim Burton set the bar too high with his previous animated film.",7,8,11,31 July 2015
Forrest Gump," The role of innocence in positive thinking and thus success ...
","... seems to be the theme of this film. Forrest Gump has an IQ of 70, is being raised by a single mom, lives in a remote part of the Deep South where there are few opportunities, and has legs that require that he wear braces as a child. Sounds like the recipe for a sad tale or at least a slow death from mediocrity right? No, instead, because Forrest isn't really bright enough to realize the situation he is in, he simply does what he's told to do or what occurs to him to be the right thing at the time and succeeds due to a lack of self doubt. He's told to run and he becomes the star of the Crimson Tide and an All American. When recovering from a war wound, he's taught ping-pong and winds up competing at the global level in China itself. He promises his dying friend Bubba that he'll go ahead with their plans and become a shrimp boat captain and his brand of seafood products becomes a household name.All along the way he never learns the lessons in life that tend to make the rest of us cynical.Gump's childhood sweetheart Jenny starts out with high aspirations - she wants to be like Joan Baez and fight for world peace - and instead she winds up disillusioned, drug addicted, and a near suicide before age 30. She doesn't have Forrest's childlike innocence and this leads her to self-doubt and ultimately failure. Also, fate or 'destiny' as the film calls it, is not on her side in one big way - her own father molested her as a child, which couldn't help but play a role in the decisions she made. Now Gump does have a bunch of coincidences on his side - call it destiny if you will - the storm that beaches every shrimping vessel in the Gulf of Mexico but his, for example - but in most cases this is just the story of a man going through life without self doubt and that little voice that tells the rest of us 'You can't do that! What are the odds! You'll fail! Make the safe choice!' To me, this is what this film is about. I think everyone sees something different in it. I highly recommend it as it is truly one of a kind. I remember when it came out it absolutely made professional reviewers crazy that people liked this film, probably because they didn't understand it.",10,10,11,22 December 2012
Fargo," Another jewel from the Coens
","This movie opens with the words 'This is a true story. The events depicted in this film took place in Minnesota in 1987. At the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occurred.' I never challenged these words, but apparently no such incidents as depicted in this film ever occurred. The movie plays out quite believably - A middle-class car salesman gets in over his head financially by embezzling from his employer, thinking that the business deals he is making with the money will allow him to replace the stolen goods before he is detected. When his schemes don't pan out he must find a way to replace the money. The salesman's father-in-law - and employer - is wealthy but distant and indifferent towards him, so he hatches a plan to fake his wife's kidnapping with the help of two felons he doesn't know at all who are 'vouched for' by an ex-con mechanic that works at the same dealership he works for. He figures his father-in-law will pay the ransom, he'll split it with the felons, and his problems will be solved. This is not to be the case. It turns out that these felons are more violent and uncontrollable than the salesman counted on, and they leave quite a body count in their wake. Also, in another clever twist, what becomes of the ransom money over which so many greedy people in the film have fought and died is quite ironic to say the least. Although I wouldn't exactly say we read this story in the paper everyday, we all have read something similar - someone who has lived an ordinary life for several decades suddenly gets tempted into some criminal activity that quickly escalates out of control.The person who unravels the mystery of the crimes is the most unstereotypical of police officers - Marge Gunderson. She is the extremely pregnant chief of police in the small town where the first murders occur, and her combination of brains and folksy charm masterfully handle witnesses and trace the crime back to the car salesman and his dealership.I've never been to Minnesota, but if the Coens' rendition of that state and its people was as spot-on as their parody of the American southwest in 'Raising Arizona', then they have really done their research. I highly recommend it.",9,0,0,31 July 2015
The Aviator," Beautifully photographed yet sometimes hard to watch
","I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making 'Hell's Angels'. He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of 'The Jazz Singer' where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929. I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of 'Six Feet Under' does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business.",8,0,0,18 August 2015
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," If Hawkeye was a DJ AND in the Vietnam War...
","... he would be Robin William's portrayal of D.J. Adrian Cronauer in this film. This ended Robin William's long period of exile in purely comedic, and quite frankly, silly films that started back in 1980 with Popeye. His career up to this point paralleled Steve Martin's in many ways, because his past career as a stand-up comic - and let's face it Mork and Mindy just had him basically doing stand-up on the four year run of that TV show - had pigeon-holed him into doing films like 'The Survivors' and 'The Best of Times' where he was doing straight comedy with mediocre scripts.This role was tailor made for Williams, because when he does his thing as the morning DJ, it is his own impromptu brash brand of fast talking comedy that made him famous. I hear that the director just gave Robin an outline of what was going on and let him rip. Nobody is safe - not then ex-Veep Nixon, not Walter Cronkite, not LBJ's daughters. Plus there is a great soundtrack of the best of sixties music. So much so that they wind up playing a song that wasn't even written in 1965 - 'You Just Keep Me Hanging On'. To play against Willams' character is Bruno Kirby as Lt. Steven Hauk who is not evil, he is just as square as he can be with no appreciation of Cronauer's humor or taste in music. I think we've all had bosses like this guy. For evil you have to go to J.T. Walsh as Sgt. Major Dickinson, who threatens and actually seems like he would enjoy sending Cronauer to his death in the jungles of Nam.Robin Williams gets to do some serious acting when he runs into the extreme censorship of the news that is done by the army - he doesn't get to report anything that isn't completely positive. And, up close and personal, he runs into the fact that 'the enemy' includes the Vietnamese themselves, who are not so much hot on Communism as they are cold to the idea of being occupied by the Americans as they had been occupied by the French before.I can't tell you anymore than this without giving something away. Just realize that this film is not a complete laughfest - there is some serious stuff going on here too - and that is why it was perfect for Robin Williams' transition to serious roles. Highly recommended.",10,1,1,6 November 2016
The Killing Fields," of friendship, hidden motives, and the hazards of being slavish to dogma
","The film depicts the relationship between New York Times reporter Sydney Schanberg (played by Sam Waterston) and his Cambodian interpreter, fellow journalist Dith Pran (Portrayed by the late Dr. Haing S. Ngor, who won a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his performance). Although anybody can do a Wikipedia search on the people and the event and see what happened, it is the suspense and tension with which the events shown are presented that makes this a special film. It actually makes you feel 'you were there' during the fall of Cambodia and the holocaust that followed.Sam Waterston didn't do that many films before his signature role as Jack McCoy on Law and Order, but he gives an intense performance here. Shanberg is one of the reporters deciding to stay in the danger zone and report on the Cambodian civil war, and on American bad acts during that war. He needs Pran as an interpreter and guide in a place where there are literally no Americans. But then comes the imminent fall of Cambodia to the Khmer Rouge, and Shanberg tells Pran he has to decide if he is to stay or go. And the question explored later on is, given that Shanberg decided to stay through the fall of Phnom Penh, did he subtly influence Pran to stay because he needed him?The genocide that followed the takeover of Cambodia by Pol Pot and his band are shown in all its horror. It makes me want to dig deeper and get the answer to the question - Did the American reporters who stayed behind just think that the Khmer Rouge were going to pass out lollipops and pat the little kids on the head and all would be hunky dory? This brings me to the hazards of being slavish to dogma. Pol Pot was a monster, but more than that he actually thought that these crazy ideas of his would work and instituted them en masse immediately. A good number of the up to three million dead in the three years that followed Pol Pot's rise to power were him actually believing you can transform a nation suddenly and completely and refusing to back down when he only brought ruin upon the land. But I'm sure he never missed a meal.There are great supporting performances by a young John Malkovich as a fellow journalist, and I tip my hat to Spaulding Grey who made a career of his one man show and documentaries built in part, at least, on his small role here.The thing that makes this really hard to watch besides the realistic horror of the war and the aftermath? There really are no 'good guys' here. The Americans, the French, the Cambodian government pre and post Pol Pot, all had their hands dirty. I highly recommend this as this is practically a docudrama on the subject.",10,1,1,3 March 2019
The Caine Mutiny," A psychological drama that begs the question - who is the real villain here?
","In the 1950's films about the problems that you encounter during wartime that have nothing to do with the enemy itself began to appear. This was one of the best. WWII threw all kinds of people together from all walks of life. There were the core career Navy along with the many who were drafted into the service because of the war, maybe disrupting plans, but they planned to make the best of it.This is the situation on the USS Caine. A new captain arrives, Lt. Commander Philip Queeg (Humphrey Bogart), professional navy man. At first, it just looks like the captain is a strong advocate of discipline, something the Caine has apparently not had much of up to this time. But then he starts seeing things that aren't there - like insisting that a man in the distance isn't properly dressed for a drill - the officers look and see that he is. He does things that indicate he could be paranoid, and that being under the strain of wartime he could have lost his nerve OR he could just be a captain that likes strict discipline. The truth would be in the eye of the beholder. You don't want to be an officer on the Caine arguing point A if the person you are making your argument to is an admiral that sees point B and believes you are just a whiner, or worse, a mutineer.In the midst of this are the ship's three officers. The instigator that brings about the eventual mutiny is Tom Keefer (Fred McMurray), who was a writer in peacetime. He tries to convince Lt. Steve Maryk (Van Johnson) as well as the young Ensign Willie Keith (Robert Francis), that the captain is mentally ill, headed for a breakdown, and possibly taking the ship with him. Keith is easily swayed by his older fellow officers, just a high society college guy who has always done what mama told him to do. Maryk is the most independent minded of the three, most interested in doing what is right. So when Queeg seems to lose his nerve in a typhoon and refuses to give an order that will save the ship, Maryk takes in all he has been fed by Keefer, considers the situation, and takes control of the Caine based on navy regulations that are germane if the captain is incapacitated. Only thing is, the captain hasn't been shot or taken physically ill, and Maryk and Keith are put on trial for mutiny before a court martial. Keefer has managed to play both sides of this and stay safely out of harm's way, having never voiced his opinions of the captain in front of anybody but Maryk and Keith.Second billed Jose Ferrer, who doesn't appear until the last part of the movie, earns his second billing as the navy attorney who is disgusted by his clients, yet agrees to take the case. It's a tricky business proving innocence in this case, because he is not allowed to directly attack the integrity of Queeg, because that is an infraction of naval law in itself. And on terra firma, Captain Queeg no longer feels the pressure he did at sea and is particularly charming and articulate. What's worse, Keefer is looking after his own neck and throws Maryk and Keith under the bus to save himself when on the stand. How will this all turn out? Watch and find out.Just an aside, a few people have said that the bit about Keith and his girl are just padding. I beg to differ. It shows that in spite of being head over heels in love, Keith does not have the nerve to stand up to his mother and tell her. If Keith can't stand up to mom, what chance would he have with Keefer? He was a follower in the first degree.Bogart was great here as a guy who is supposed to be the villain in a way, but has a completely sympathetic part. As Ferrer's character points out, when everyone else was all tucked away safe in their beds, it was people like Queeg that kept the navy going in peacetime, before the war. The scene before the mutiny where Queeg basically goes to the ship's other officers for help after he realizes he is so strongly disliked and comes up empty adds further sympathy and thus ambiguity to his part.This is great storytelling about a group of people who have nothing in common brought together to fight a war which in this case yields tragic results. In other words, it is very realistic. I highly recommend this old film.",9,8,11,2 July 2016
Van Helsing," One of the worst movies made by a major Hollywood studio I have ever seen...
","... and I qualify that because of course there are worse films out there, but they were often made by poverty row studios with no budget. Universal Studios is not poverty row.Why did I give it three stars? Because effects and cinematography have to count for something, and that this film has in spades. But in the plot and direction departments, this thing is one ugly mess. Van Helsing is the legendary vampire hunter, often ably played by Peter Cushing over at Hammer studios back in the 50s and 60s. Here you have another fine actor, underrated Hugh Jackman, playing Van Helsing, but you'd never get that by what goes on here.So Universal drags out every legendary horror character in their catalog - not just Dracula, who actually IS a vampire. They manage to incorporate the Frankenstein monster and The Werewolf too. Bring in the mummy, the invisible man, and the creature from the black lagoon and the gang would all be here. There really is no plot to speak of, just lots of flying female vamps so you can get some gratuitous nudity in, and then there is a plot line installed to lampoon Jackman's role as Wolverine over at Marvel.The bottom line - there must be something better you can do with your time.

Being John Malkovich," Three who deserved one another
","I give my nine points for originality and the quality of production though, not the likeability of the characters. John Cusack and Cameron Diaz play Craig and Lotte Schwartz, a married couple that are going through the motions and don't seem to realize it. Cameron Diaz is made up to be so dowdy looking that she is initially not even recognizable. They live in a basement apartment crowded with animals (Lotte is an animal lover who works at a pet shop). Craig is a puppeteer who cannot find work in his chosen field and even gets beat up on the street for staging what one beefy dad thinks is a sacrilegious puppet show.At the suggestion of his wife, Craig goes looking for a regular job, and due to his fast hands he gets a job as a file clerk at LesterCorp. There he meets Maxine, a pretty but sociopathic young woman who, fortunately for society, seems to have no violent impulses, because if she did believe me she would follow them. Craig falls for her. Lotte falls for her. And they both make a play for her simultaneously when she comes over for dinner one night. She rejects them both.Maxine made it clear from the beginning she considered Craig a pathetic loser, but she needs him to exploit something that Craig discovered - a door that leads to a portal in which anybody who enters gets to 'become' John Malkovich for fifteen minutes. At the end of the fifteen minutes the person is spit out on the side of the road at the entry to the New Jersey Turnpike. As a team they reopen Lestercorp at night and charge people 200 dollars apiece to 'become John Malkovich'. Neither of them knows what this portal is doing there behind a file cabinet and why it leads to Malkovich, but they initially don't care past its monetary value.It is part drama, part comedy, and even part horror and completely weird. And what the portal is doing there is all wrapped up in Dr. Lester, owner of Lestercorp, who is the only likeable character in the film, and even he has more than a bit of a Dr. Frankenstein/God complex.Also featuring Mary Kay Place as the object of Dr. Lester's lust who has convinced him he has a terrible speech impediment - he does not, John Malkovich as himself, and Charlie Sheen as himself and Malkovich's friend. It is great seeing Charlie Sheen when he was still healthy.Very highly recommended. But the plot is so weird you just have to let go of your reason and go with it.",9,0,0,7 July 2019
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," A sweet romance buried underneath 'Man Show' style humor
","If you liked 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy' you will love this movie. In fact, it rejoins a couple of the supporting cast of that film, starring Steve Carrell, who played 'Brick' who, in my opinion, stole that show with his clueless stares and inane ramblings.In this film, Andy, the 40-year-old virgin, gets a lot of unwanted help from his male coworkers, who are all so completely dysfunctional that they really don't have any business trying to repair anyone else's private life. The fact that Andy also still rides a bicycle and is chided by his coworkers for that, too, just seems to emphasize that modern society has turned virginity into a stigma similar to not being able to pass a driving test. Instead of wanting to lose his virginity, though, what Andy really wants is a relationship with the nice woman running a store across the street from where he works. His virginity is just a byproduct of him not finding a good relationship with a woman yet. The resulting story is actually a rather sweet romance buried underneath all of the Man Show style humor.It carries a rare message in modern film - that chastity before marriage is not a bad thing, and that everybody is running on their own schedule.",7,11,16,20 April 2013
Collateral," A throwback to the noirs of old...
","... where an average guy gets caught up in criminal activity either through bad decision making or just bad luck. This would be a case of the latter.This thriller is about a professional hit man(Cruise) who high-jacks a taxi cab and forces the driver (Foxx) to take him around to all his 'assignments' and also seems to put Foxx in a situation that could get him killed or at least be taken for an accomplice.This is the movie which several critics thought Foxx deserved his Academy award for rather than the following year's 'Ray'. I thought he could be considered deserving in both years. In this Michael Mann directed flick, Foxx puts in an excellent performance, and Cruise also does a fine job as the cold, business-like hit man. It's when Foxx's character discovers that his woman, an attorney with the Justice department(Jada Pinkett Smith), is one of Cruise's targets, he takes major steps in trying to save her and put an end to his troubles with Cruise, who isn't as lucky on the L train as he was in 'Risky Business'.",8,6,7,2 September 2017
Dunkirk," Nolan simply made an epic film about survival...
","... and it worked! At least for me. Now for a few words about that Nolan style in this film.Christopher Nolan wants to have his cake and eat it too, and he's been successful enough that he's one of the very few directors who gets the opportunity to do so anymore, in a franchise world where the auteur theory is dead and producers are way more important than directors (witness Kathleen Kennedy firing the Lord brothers from the Han Solo movie because they were actually attempting to impose a personal vision upon it, something the Star Wars franchise will never allow any director to do ever).Nolan wants to work in super-mainstream genres: super-heroes, war, science fiction. But he wants his product also to be very self-consciously and in-your-face artistic. He sets up little rules for each movie and he plays by them, and it's up to the viewers to figure them out.There are three main story lines in Dunkirk, and each one unspools over a different frame of time. So, the Harry Styles story line covers one week of time, the Mark Rylance story line covers one day, and the Tom Hardy story line covers only one hour! This information is provided to us at the beginning of the movie. There is a title card that reads '1. The Mole: One Week'. This is supposed to tell us that this particular story line in the movie is going to cover one week. But I spent 15 seconds thinking, 'One week? What does that mean?' before there was so much shooting I got caught up in the action on-screen and didn't think about the title card for the rest of the movie.It wasn't until later that I was enlightened as to Nolan's intent. I am accustomed to movies tinkering with time concepts, yet I didn't get that this movie was playing around with time for the entirety of the time that I watched it. I was like, man, Tom Hardy has been in that plane for a really unrealistic amount of time! I'm just arrogant enough to think that if I didn't get the time tricks, then I'm guessing most of the viewers of Dunkirk didn't get, or didn't even notice, all this jumping around in time. Doesn't really distract from one's enjoyment of the movie, unless you stop to think about Tom Hardy still being in that plane ...Other extremely self-consciously artistic Nolan choices: no German soldier's face is ever seen clearly in the entire movie. Also, the violence is very self-consciously bloodless and sanitary. Nolan has said he wanted the movie to be about rescue and heroism; not war and violence.There's also a ticking stopwatch motif playing on the soundtrack virtually the entire movie. Nolan's call or Hans Zimmer's, I don't know. The stopwatch features very prominently in the trailers, but I didn't know it was also going to run for the duration of the movie, as well.If everything I have written seems like I didn't like the film, let me say that is not true. I get that Nolan could have made a conventional war movie, but he took a home run swing and went with something much more experimental, and I thought his reasoning for this was pretty clear by the end: this is NOT a classic 'hero's plot arc' story. It just doesn't fit that mold. You could see in the conclusion that most of the fighters felt like cowards and failures. To paraphrase Churchill, you don't win wars by retreating. And, yet, there was a humble, understated glory in this moment. This was a movie about duty above all else - just many small people doing the small things asked of them.",8,6,11,23 September 2017
Pearl Harbor," What exactly was the point of this film?
","Put extremely attractive young men and women into the fashions of 1941 but with the moral attitudes of the 21st century, add special effects, completely throw out any basis in actual fact in order to get an emotional reaction from the audience (here the film succeeds for all the wrong reasons), add a few rousing speeches, and you have Pearl Harbor. The only good thing about this film are the special effects, and even then I prefer the more primitively done Tora,Tora,Tora from thirty years before because it actually tells the truth about what led up to the raid in painstaking detail, actually taking the time to show what is going on with both the Japanese and the Americans and the mistakes and misjudgments made on both sides. If you want steamy love scenes and nicely done explosions and graphics, watch this film. If you want to be entertained while learning something about history watch Tora, Tora, Tora. You won't regret it.Just one word about the commentary track if you get the DVD. The best thing about DVDs of films directed by Michael Bay are the commentary tracks. Hearing this track, I could easily see where some of the bad dialogue came from. The problem is that Michael Bay interviewed many Pearl Harbor veterans, and he used the expressions they used in the movie. There's 125 different personalities crammed into a few characters that are spewing the bad dialogue. I'm guessing Mr. Bay took all the expressions these people said and had two or three characters say everything. So all the clichéd expressions the veterans used during their lives are shoved into 3 hours. That's my take anyway. Mr. Bay does admit that one thing he would change if he could would be the earnest dialogue because the younger people seem to think it's corny.The DVD is very cheap to purchase at this point, and is worth it for the commentary track alone.",4,13,22,1 May 2010
Independence Day," Ed Wood would be proud
","It is still amazing to me that this film was the top grossing movie of 1996, followed by 'Twister', which in many ways was equally cheesy. I remember seeing the ads for this movie before it was released, and even a well-polished advertising campaign could not hide the schlockiness of it all.The dialogue is completely forgettable, the plot is thin and obvious, and even if you can suspend your beliefs and assume that an Apple laptop computer can do all of the stunts that Jeff Goldblum's character's computer can do and that a crop duster suffering from chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (Randy Quaid) can learn how to fly late 20th century state-of-the-art military planes basically by instinct, there is one final piece of posturing that is too much to take. Never would the President of the United States both endanger himself and allow himself to become a spectacle by putting on a flight suit and piloting a plane in a time of war ... Oh, yeah, I almost forgot about that incident back in 2003...oops...my bad.The reason I am even giving this film 4/10 is for one, the special effects are impressive in a movie that has precious little else going for it. Secondly, and most of all, the only thing that makes this movie remotely watchable is Will Smith. Even with what the writers/directors give him to work with he steals the show. Plus, the 'buddy' thing he has going with Jeff Goldblum's character when they go to deliver the computer virus to the alien spacecraft comes off well. I'm just glad that Will Smith got to showcase what he is really capable of the following year when he starred in a quality film about alien life on earth, 'Men in Black'.",4,8,14,15 November 2009
Gone with the Wind," If you ever (thought you) wanted something you couldn't have, you need to watch this film
","Gone with the Wind is a great visual spectacle, but that wouldn't keep people watching after 75 years if it wasn't for the timeless tales of three kinds of love - obsession mistaken for love (Scarlett for Ashley), sexual obsession turned to love for someone who doesn't reciprocate (Rhett for Scarlett), and true love with a barrier thrown in the way to prevent that love from being physically expressed (Melanie and Ashley) - the barrier being that Melanie cannot have another child without losing her life, and in the 19th century that means only one thing - no sex. Scarlett has it all - beauty, brains, and eventually, a husband who can keep up with her - the dashing Rhett Butler, whom she doesn't appreciate because - well - she has him. She wants what she can't have and has never had - the love of the rather drab and double-minded Ashley Wilkes who loves the not so beautiful not so clever and not so healthy Melanie. One thing that Melanie does have - great heart, and a belief in the honor of the people in her life, regardless of whether that belief is earned or not. The story is also one of transformation as Scarlett goes from pre-War southern Belle to hardened businesswoman post-War, in an effort to keep her family together and to keep the family plantation, Tara, out of Yankee and carpetbagger hands. Unlike her more genteel family and friends, who either lose everything or in one tragic case - her father - lose their sanity, she holds it together against forces she doesn't really understand and does whatever she has to do to beat the Yankees at their own game. But through it all she just can't get that unrequited obsession with Ashley out of her head, and that is more her personal undoing than anything the War did or ever could have done.This film is a demonstration of the best the studio system could do in that fabled year of 1939, and it showed that the studios had finally 'got' putting together a costume drama that conveys true raw human emotions and reactions and even eroticism without crossing that pesky production code line. For anybody who has ever made a wrong decision in love that you wish you could do over, for anyone who has ever had their world suddenly change for the worse and had to adapt, I highly recommend this film.",10,14,22,10 August 2013
The Princess Bride," More of a theory than a review
","I didn't have this theory about 'The Princess Bride' for years, until I came close to the age of the grandfather that Peter Falk portrays.Here's my theory. The grandfather goes to the bedside of his grandson, portrayed by Fred Savage, prepared to do what grandfathers do - read him a story. But no, the grandson protests. Does it have sports in it? This is a silly 'yucky' story full of kissing. Skip the kissing parts! So the grandfather decides to teach the grandson a lesson (the beginning of my theory). He takes what was probably a straightforward tale of love lost and found again, of giants and evil princes and rescues and magic spells, and embellishes it with the wisdom that can only come from living sixty years on this planet. Because, let's face it, The Princess Bride as we are told has much wisdom in it.What are the chances that a story that has been around for a hundred years has lines such as 'You fell victim to one of the classic blunders - the most famous of which is 'never get involved in a land war in Asia'. Only somebody who lived through the Vietnam War era (the grandfather) would come up with this. Too bad Dubya wasn't read this book as a child. Then there is the bit about the Dread Pirate Roberts - an unseen villain who turns out to be a series of villains. He would tuck Wesley into bed each night after he captured him and say 'Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning.' What other sentence so captures the sentiment of working for large corporations these days who will throw you out into the street without a backwards glance? The book hits how people believe something is real or not real based merely on their feelings about it with this zinger as Wesley carries the princess through a dangerous swamp. She cautions him about the ROUS's (Rodents of Unusual Size). Wesley's defense - 'I don't think they exist'. One immediately attacks.And finally a great quote about love. An angry Prince Humperdinck after being rejected by Buttercup goes to where Wesley is about to be tortured and states 'You truly love each other, and so you might have been truly happy. Not one couple in a century has that chance, no matter what the storybooks say.' Only after kissing frogs for decades can I say this is so true. And on it goes.Thus most of the wisdom of living modern life can be found in this tale within a tale, and I highly recommend it for its humor, its wisdom, and uniqueness. I don't think I've seen anything quite like it.",10,17,24,1 January 2017
Lawrence of Arabia," A sweeping epic with many layers of complexity
","It's hard for the small screen to do justice to such a sweeping cinematographic epic, but there is much more to this film than its visual majesty. The film has one of the most beautiful and recognized scores in the history of cinema, a fascinating subject in the person of T.E. Lawrence himself, one of the most literate screenplays ever written, and a wonderful supporting cast nearing perfection. It is a shame that unless you take the time to buy the DVD and invest the almost four hours it takes to watch it, you are likely to miss out on one of the best films ever made. It is precisely because of its length that it is seldom seen on TV anymore. The backdrop of the film is that the British, in the midst of fighting World War I, are aiding the Arab struggle for independence from the Turks since anything that ties up the Turks accomplishes the British goal of destroying the Ottoman Empire and thus aids in the war effort. T. E. Lawrence is first enlisted to help advise the Arabs in their military goals, but goes on to lead them in a series of stunning military victories that goes way beyond what the British expected of the Arabs, and quite frankly, way beyond what the British wanted. You see, the British had designs on claiming Arabia for themselves after the war ends, years before it was discovered that Arabia was sitting on the world's richest oil supply.However, this is really an oversimplification of a very complex film. This movie is so multi-faceted that you could tackle reviewing it from several angles. To me one of the most fascinating aspects of the film is the complex relationship and contrast between Sheriff Ali (Omar Sharif), fellow tribesman and counsel to Prince Feisal, and T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole). When the two first meet Ali shoots down Lawrence's Arab companion who is taking him to first meet Feisel because the man is drinking from Ali's well and does not have permission to do so. An outraged Lawrence chastises Ali citing that Arabia will never be great as long as they war amongst themselves and that he is 'barborous and cruel'. Towards the end of the film, though, there is a reversal of roles as Ali tries to stop a massacre that Lawrence is not only allowing his troops to participate in, but seems to be genuinely enjoying. Ali is a man who has a good bead on who he is and what he believes. Not having this quality is Lawrence's greatest shortcoming. Lawrence either believes he is much less than he is or much more, depending on his latest exploits and who has talked to him last. Ali clearly sees this problem, and by the end of the film Ali is Lawrence's fast friend - in fact his only true friend. You see, Lawrence is being used by both the Arabs and the British. This becomes immensely clear when at the end of the film Prince Feisel, who has always seemed to be genuine towards Lawrence, says during negotiations with the British 'Lawrence is a double-edged sword - We are equally glad to be rid of him, are we not?'. By the way, the role of Ali has to be Sharif's finest hour as an actor. I always thought Dr. Zhivago was that finest role, and it is still a great performance, but this one is even better.There are so many other themes going on in this film - the thin line between madness and heroism, the worth of a single human life versus the welfare of an entire army or a nation, the sometimes less than honorable motives behind those fighting for the honorable goal independence, the contrast between western and Arab values - that you could go on forever. That is why I strongly recommend this film. You'll probably come away with something a little different on each viewing.",10,10,14,21 November 2009
Avengers: Infinity War," Marvel scores again
","Epic superhero team-up from Marvel Studios and directors Anthony & Joe Russo. When an alien named Thanos (motion capture and voice performance from Josh Brolin) begins to collect all six of the Infinity Stones, incredibly powerful artifacts that grant their possessor unimaginable abilities, it's up to the galaxy's greatest heroes to try and stop him. Original Avengers Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Captain America (Chris Evans) join forces with newcomers Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and even the Guardians of the Galaxy, among others, but will their combined might be enough to stop Thanos' apocalyptic plan? The culmination of plotlines 10 years in the making, this is one of the biggest gambles in movie history, and it seems to have paid off. The directors and screenwriters somehow manage to juggle this many characters and keep the balance just about right, with memorable moments doled out to all of them. The plot itself is very basic ('Stop Thanos'), and much time is spent on well-executed action scenes and eye-candy science fiction set-pieces. The dialogue is very humorous, and the various character combinations are amusing. There are usually three or four story directions going on at once, with the action switching from location to location frequently, but never in such a way as to become a distraction or disorienting. The biggest question mark of the film was how well Thanos would turn out, a villain that's been teased for the last 6 years in these movies. I was dubious about Brolin's casting, as while I like him in many things, he never struck me as intergalactic demi-god alien appropriate. I'm happy to say that he works out fine, and while the effects work done on him is very good, his voice sells the character, arguably one of the best developed out of any of the Marvel movies thus far.I won't go into spoiler territory, but I will mention that the ending may befuddle or even anger some viewers. As a former comic book reader, I wasn't upset by it, and even expected it (even before the internet spoiled things for me). But those going in blind should be prepared for an unconventional finale.",8,5,8,26 August 2018
Velvet Goldmine," This film is loosely based on David Bowie...
","... on the cusp of stardom in the early 1970s with his 'Ziggy Stardust' album and persona (the title comes from a Bowie song of that period). In fact, Bowie was approached, but he then had plans of making his own movie about this time, and demurred. He also did not allow the use of his music for this film.So a somewhat fictionalized account was used. It is told in flashback, when newspaper writer played by Christian Bale has to write an article about a sensational death of a rock star, which turned out to have been staged and fraudulent. The rock star is a Ziggy-like androgynous glam-rock star, played by Jonathan Rhys Myers. Bale's writer has ambivalent feelings about the assignment, behaving a bit like a clumsy teenager at the time, attracted to this glam rock movement and struggling with his sexuality. Ewan McGregor plays another rock star who is a pastiche of Lou Reed, Iggy Pop and Mick Jagger. Toni Collette plays an Angela Bowie type character, who helps fill in the gaps of the story of her husband.The British glam-rock scene seems to have been well-captured, with all the purported decadence of the stars. Classic songs of the period by the likes of T.Rex, Slade, Roxy Music, Brian Eno, and Cockney Rebel make up for the lack of Bowie songs. Highly recommended.",7,0,0,21 November 2018
The Lion King," Had this just been a nature film, it would be great!
","The animals are well photographed and you have some great shots of them, but then if I wanted that I would watch a David Attenborough documentary and learn something in the process.So you basically have dialogue over well shot animals who do not convey the emotions called for in the script, so the entire production is pretty boring.This is what you lose when you take The Lion King OUT of animation and into live action. The original 1994 version of Lion King was illustrated by artists who actually watched real animals - yes and lions - move, and they tried to capture that motion in their drawings along with the emotions that the animals were feeling. I saw the original in theatres and I think that they succeeded brilliantly.Disney has obviously got the technical end of movie making down. What they can't seem to do in the last ten years is capture an audience with narrative and acting. First they buy a bunch of franchises - Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars, and have been failing with them. Now they are trashing their own legacy. Even Michael Eisner, an untrustworthy suit and bean counter, knew how to deliver when it came to entertainment when he was in charge of Disney.",5,8,12,25 July 2019
Amadeus," To give everything you have to music and come up short
","At the tender age of 26, when I still thought no film was complete without a car chase and a big explosion, Amadeus had me hooked. I went to see it multiple times back in 1984 during its initial release, back when the theater was empty whenever it played and before it was nominated by the Academy.This film is an unusual biography, and I often like to compare it with Ed Wood, since both Ed Wood and Salieri were men who gave everything they had to their respective crafts and came up short. Salieri, a contemporary of Mozart, has only one dream - to be a great composer. Predating the prosperity gospel by about two hundred years, Salieri mistakes obsessing with God over his own earthly desires with actual godliness, even being happy when his father - who objects to Salieri's musical interests - chokes to death and leaves Salieri free to pursue his musical dreams. He chalks this up to God's will for his career. Problems begin when Salieri meets a twenty-something Mozart at the court of the Emperor in Vienna, where Salieri is the court composer. Mozart is everything Salieri is not - profane, forward, and a great composer. Salieri starts down the road to insanity as he realizes the childish Mozart has all of the gifts he ever wanted and has been denied. However, Salieri is not an outright failure as was Ed Wood. In many ways he is something worse than a ridiculous failure - he is mediocre, and worse yet, he knows it.Salieri,angry at God for honoring a profane ungrateful boy like Mozart while ignoring his own one desire to be a great composer, swears to destroy Mozart. The strange thing is, as long as Mozart is alive, Salieri is the honored composer, not Mozart, though this just seems to infuriate Salieri even more. Salieri seems to be the only person in Vienna who recognizes Mozart's talent. This just begs the question - why did it never occur to Salieri that being able to recognize something as valuable before anyone else does is a talent in and of itself? After all, in 1975 the second best thing to being Bill Gates would have been to have recognized his genius and invested heavily in his success. But I digress.The cinematography and art direction on this film are outstanding. The visuals start out light and festive, matching Mozart's mood and prospects. As poverty, illness, and the guilt of his father's death close in on Mozart during the second half of the film, the mood and visuals become very dark to match what is happening in Mozart's own life. Highly recommended.",9,9,12,16 January 2010
Ghostbusters," Just a perfect piece of comedic timing and so 80s
","Ghostbusters was so great because it took the science fiction and fantasy part seriously (considering how Dan Aykroyd IRL is a strong believer in the paranormal this makes sense), so the humor was almost entirely from dialogue and the performance of the cast. It takes the simple concept of 'people who start a ghost catching business' and adds things like multidimensional gods and giant killer corporate mascots. These are things you wouldn't expect from a comedy movie at the time. Apparently, Aykroyd's original draft of the story was almost entirely sci-fi action with little humor.The resulting story was dead serious, and rather terrifying. A woman becoming possessed by a demon just because of where her apartment is? Being transformed into a monster, then into stone while she was unwillingly in service to a dark god? That is scary, not funny. What MADE the movie funny was how the actors responded to the situation. They were just like normal people, put in an abnormal situation, and responded in line with their own personal character, which was mainly to crack jokes so they could handle the fear. It was just four guys, out of their depth, going in with a grin because backing down wasn't an option for them.Bill Murray just shows outstanding comedic timing in this one. He had me from the opening scene where he is shocking a male subject in an experiment while simultaneously trying to 'get the girl' by convincing her she is psychic.What was 80s about it? Well, the triumph of the private sector over academeia - 'I've worked in the private sector, they expect results', and the EPA contributing to the end of the world. Everybody could forget about Watergate, recessions, and nuclear war, and just laugh at the movies for a change. If you've never seen it I recommend it . The comedy is timeless.",10,16,17,29 June 2018
Call Me by Your Name," Elegant and painfully passionate
","There were many scenes in this movie that stuck with me, most of which have probably been discussed to death (the dad, the peach, the sheer pleasure of sitting around reading, swimming, and doing whatever you want unsupervised).I think as an American, one of the things that stuck to my bones was how the parents reacted to their son's sexuality. I don't mean his homosexuality. I mean, sexuality as a whole. Despite most of the key characters being American, they all have a European sensibility that it very rare to see here in the US. One could argue that the movie itself could be making a social comment about open, honest European views of sex vs. moralizing, restrictive American views.First, the parents see their son is attracted to a man, so they do things to help facilitate that attraction by giving them the idea to travel alone together. They also let Elio and Oliver have their space in the house - they aren't monitoring Elio or 'checking up on him,' which I found refreshing.Second, the parents are genuinely always there for Elio in helping him discuss sexual relationships. He is able to say to his parents out loud, 'I could never be that open,' a vulnerable statement I have trouble imagining ever having expressed to my parents. They simply reassure him; they don't nag or moralize him about sex. Of course, there's the scene with the father discussing his own sexual past and desires, openly and without judgment that exemplifies this behavior.Third, the adults in the movie treat Elio respectfully with regards to his sexual encounters. For example, when Elio greets the older gay couple with Marzia and quickly gives her a kiss and loving pat, the adults simply maturely greet her and say hello. No one says 'Ohhhhhhh! You have a GIRRRLFRIENND!!!!!!!!!' In the US, I find it typical that adults make teasing comments and condescending 'jokes' about 'how cute it is to have a crush' to teenagers. This moralizing can make teens internalize that they are doing something wrong, when they are actually doing something natural.To see adults treat Elio respectfully and collegially, like a mature young adult for whom sex is one of many natural, positive experiences, filled me with hope, jealousy, and a strong feeling about the kind of parent one should be when one has teenagers. It's not very common you walk out of a movie thinking, 'This movie has changed or informed the way I want to live my life' but this one has for me.Last, I think we are in a particular time where we are really looking back on the 1980s with a specific nostalgia for a time when kids could just be kids, ride their bikes everywhere, have adventures, be home for dinner, then go out again and have more unsupervised adventures. Stranger Things, It, and this film all are really tapping into that nostalgia, albeit in slightly different ways.The music in this movie is what I can only describe as beautiful, Sufjan's songs in particular stand out as incredibly moving. Visions of Gideon is an absolute soul crusher. The music added to the atmosphere of the movie, which was so warm and peaceful. It was so refreshing to see a movie about two men in a relationship that didn't end with one of them dying or angry parents, nothing of the sort. Time is the villain here, and I think that makes it all the more tragic.",8,116,139,22 October 2018
The Longest Day," Could have been unwieldy, instead it is comprehensive
","In 1962, almost post studio system 20th Century Fox was in trouble. Almost broke because of the cost of making then in-progress Cleopatra, they were in a similar fix with filming 'The Longest Day'. They had been churning out a series of small films with small stars that were losers at the box office. Turn on Fox Movie Channel Retro if you want an object lesson in their sorry output during the late 50s/early 60s. Enter stage left Darryl F. Zanuck, former head of Fox studio, who had left the states in 1956 to make a series of loser films in Europe with his girlfriends who were loser actresses. He argued how he could rescue The Longest Day to the board of directors, and the job became his.The result is a great film in the tradition of old Hollywood - Zanuck's kind of Hollywood - that entertains on a grand scale, telling the story of the Allied invasion of France with a star studded cast. The big stars of the day were all there, with special billing for John Wayne. The cast includes Eddie Albert, Robert Mitchum, Henry Fonda, Sean Connery, Red Buttons, Steve Forrest and Leo Genn. Unbelievably Sal Mineo and Roddy McDowell get into the act too. And there are many others.There are many stories being told in many places from the viewpoints of the Allied soldiers, the Germans, and the French resistance prior to the actual invasion. We don't get to follow the stories of all of these people to the end, but each story gives us a slice of life and produces a great and compelling story of the overall invasion. You don't know who is going to get cut down suddenly, who is going to make it, and who is just going to be the victim of just plain bad luck. It is all part of the horror of war. Highly recommended. It is a long film, but it is also an engrossing one.",8,10,12,6 January 2019
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Like Forrest Gump without the wit or charm
","The most irritating part of Benjamin Button is that it has this strange premise (aging backward) and doesn't take advantage of it. The Fitzgerald short story actually shows Benjamin going through life stages backward (from cranky old geezer to mild-mannered husband to young virile asshole; it's actually pretty funny and interesting) whereas the movie merely shows this dull blank slate of a character aging backwards biologically with this soporific love story thrown into it. Like he starts off as this little old man, but he just comes across like a soft-spoken kid with a bad skin disease (I get that it was trying to go for that 'second childhood' phase but I felt like it chickened out, like why not start out asa cranky old geezer). The movie was too afraid to be weird and interesting, instead vying for safer Hollywood schmaltz. It was all just so incredibly bland.",6,7,11,17 November 2019
Hidden Figures," It made for an old-fashioned movie going experience...
","This is the true story of three African-American women who worked for NASA on the Mercury program in the early 1960s. Solid performances by all, some laugh-out-loud scenes, and some very emotional moments. It's also an important look back at the civil rights issues of the time period. The climax is a bit Apollo 13ish, and I'm fairly certain some scenes were embellished, but who cares. You should walk away from this film smiling, maybe even a bit choked up.And in spite of it being an overall positive experience, I could feel the oppression at certain points - Dorothy at the library just trying to find the right book, but it is in a part of the library to which she cannot gain admittance due to her race. Mary being reminded that she must sit in the back of the court room, again because of her race. Katherine runs across campus just to find a bathroom that she is allowed to use and never once complaining about it until she is publicly berated about her use of time. Kevin Costner's character appears to be a generally good person who doesn't care about race, and yet still never even thought about the difficulty of being forced into a certain bathroom half a mile away. You don't need to understand the mathematics to enjoy the film, but I admit, it was fun to hear some concepts I haven't heard since my college days.The theater was almost full, with people of all ages. I was particularly happy to see some kids there, as there is much for them to take away from this film.Twice during the movie the audience broke into applause, and then applauded at the end credits as well. I don't recall the last time I heard that at a film. And most importantly - I did not see a cell phone light up the whole time - truly a miracle.",9,134,224,22 January 2017
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Artfully combines two very different holidays
","Who would ever think that a musical about the overlap between Halloween and Christmas would work? However, it does work with the songs not exactly being Christmas - or Halloween - classics, but fitting the dark mood of this film perfectly.The movie opens with Jack Skellington, AKA the Pumpkin King, facing an identity crisis of sorts. Halloween has just ended in his hometown of Halloween Town, and he has been receiving kudos from everyone in town for making this year's Halloween the scariest ever. But Jack is seeking purpose in his life, and scaring people to death once a year just isn't doing it for him anymore. He takes a walk in the woods and he discovers a group of trees each with doors and different symbols on each door. He opens the door with the tree symbol on it, and finds himself in Christmas Town. While there, he is fascinated by the contrast of Christmas Town with his own world. Jack returns home, along with a sampling of trinkets from Christmas Town, to contemplate the meaning of what he has found there. Ultimately he decides that this year, Halloween Town is going to take charge of Christmas. Jack has also decided that he will replace 'Sandy Claws' on his yearly sleigh ride, delivering presents to all of the children of the world. All of the citizens of Halloween Town are enthused by the idea except Sally, a creation of Halloween Town's mad scientist, who coincidentally is also looking for something new in her life. She alone sees the danger of Halloween Town hijacking the Christmas holiday.While the Grinch tried to destroy Christmas and came away with a true understanding of the meaning of the holiday, Jack Skellington, with the best of intentions, is on the road to ruin Christmas. In preparation for the big event, he enlists the townspeople to help make toys, and they just can't get the hang of making or doing anything that is not designed to terrify. In fact, when Jack makes his Christmas ride and the town hears on the radio of the terror Jack is causing, they actually see this as a sign of success. To them, horror equals happiness.Like most good films designed for all age groups, the movie is actually weaving a tale on two levels. The story itself is very straightforward so that children can easily follow it. On a second level, there is deft humor and one-liners that are obviously aimed at adults, such as the mayor's plea to Jack -'I'm only an elected official here! I can't make decisions!' Or when the scientist who created Sally gets tired of her running away and builds a new creation to replace her. This one turns out to be just a female version of the mad scientist himself to which he has endowed half of his own brain. His conclusion is 'You will be a decided improvement over that treacherous Sally. We'll have conversations worth having.' You'll see quite a bit of similarity between the style of art design here and that done in some of Tim Burton's other films, such as 'Beetlejuice'. You'll also probably recognize Danny Elfman's style of score that has come to decorate so many of Burton's other films. I highly recommend this film as great entertainment for the whole family.",9,10,13,19 October 2010
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Don't reward Disney for this travesty and hand over your money to watch this Mickey Mouse movie
","Modern Disney - you know, the one that has to buy Pixar to gain any originality - has its fingerprints all over this one. There were great visuals, entertaining characters, and funny one-liners. Oh, and this one had inspirational messages: Anyone can be a hero, we fight out of love, failure is a teacher, etc. (however ham-fisted).The audience was there for the world-building and the advancement of the story. None of which really happened. So the audience focused on the string of plot holes, lapses in logic, and generally lack of anything new or interesting that was added to the Star Wars world. The Last Jedi is the cinematic reverse equivalent of fast food. Critics were more than happy with it because they came expecting a Transformers like CGI fest - they got that; the audience was expecting more. Plus after two movies we literally know nothing about Rey except that she is good at anything with little or no training. The only real spoiler I offer - given what happened on and off the set of the last two Star Wars films - is that the franchise is currently left in the same place as the British TV show Black Adder at the end of each season, minus Rowan Atkinson and the originality. I have to give it 4/10 stars just for the art design and technical expertise and nothing else. A big budget film like this could never be a 1 or a 2 out of ten. That's an Ed Wood film or 'Manos The Hands of Fate' (don't ask). Likewise a 10/10 is Casablanca or The Godfather - when everything including acting, directing, depth of the plot and the ability to argue about themes, all come together such that the film still resonates years after it was made. This one made it about a third of the way between these two extremes.",4,17,22,28 December 2017
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," You can't have one without the other
","I'm only subtracting one star because either part one or part two taken alone seems incomplete, yet satisfying nonetheless. If they could have been merged into one film it would be the perfect combination of mystery, mythology, and exposition.Uma Thurman was nominated for a Golden Globe as 'The Bride,' a woman who seeks revenge against the group of assassins, of whom she was once a member, who turned her wedding rehearsal into a bloodbath, killing everybody else in the wedding chapel and putting her into a coma for four years and having her awaken to an empty womb - she looked about eight months pregnant when Bill shot her. In volume one, although all five of the people involved in the massacre are on The Bride's hit list, she only kills two of them.The Bride goes after Vivica Fox's now-married housewife and mother, and Lucy Liu's Yakuza boss, which requires a trip to Japan. Tarantino pays homage to Japanese samurai films and Hong Kong martial arts films to make an entertaining story with excellent editing and soundtrack. A perfect start to what's to be expected in Vol. 2., which is where all of the backstories appear.If you walk away from both parts one and two wondering if there is any symbolism in there, is what you thought you saw what you really saw, and what on earth does that last scene mean?...consider yourself in good company. And my only spoiler, why didn't Lucy Liu's character want to kill Bill as much as Uma Thurman's did? That is, if what you think you see implied in part one is indeed true.This is Tarantino's best as far as I'm concerned. Every time I see either part one or part two on cable I'll stop what I'm doing and watch. Not recommended if you are squeamish though.",9,10,17,8 March 2017
The Last Emperor," A good film minus the kindly portrayal of the Communist Chinese
","This film is one of only three total Best Picture winners that won every one of the awards for which it was nominated, but strangely enough it received no nominations for acting. I found this odd, since I thought that one of the film's finer points were its performances.In this film, Pu-Yi grows to a man who was deposed as the last emperor of China while still a child, and thus he wanders from country to country as a young man who is wealthy but without purpose. Thus, never really coming to terms with the fact that he is no longer king, he jumps at the chance to sell himself out as a puppet to the Japanese when they offer him the opportunity to rule at least part of China again. As Emperor of Manchukuo, Pu-Yi is blind to the barbarous acts and experiments that the Japanese perform upon his subjects, blind to the fact that his wife has an affair with a servant to produce a royal heir, and most of all, blind to his role as puppet in the Japanese scheme for world domination. Not until the end of World War II does he seem to even have an inkling of what has been going on.Now for the part of the movie to which I really object. Although it is compelling to see Pu-Yi slowly owe up to his responsibility for what happened in China during the Japanese occupation and come to terms with the fact that he is, after all, just a man like any other man, I strongly object to the Maoists as the good-guys in this quest for redemption. The Communist Chinese did the same type of reindoctrination on many other people - among them Christian missionaries, Buddhist monks, and believers in democracy and a free press - anyone who simply got in their way and needed their world view 'readjusted'. On top of that, how the Communists reindoctrinate people in this film is G-rated compared to what really went on in such camps. For details, consult the novel '1984'. These points are completely whitewashed. Without the flaw of the portrayal of the Communist Chinese as the patient and kindly savers of lost souls this would have pretty much been a perfect film.",8,10,15,21 November 2009
Big Fish," This is a Tim Burton film with a different vibe...
","... than most of his more gothic fantasy oriented films. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney both play the same character--Edward Bloom. Finney is the older, present day Edward Bloom and McGregor plays him as a teenager and younger man. Finney's segments are set in the present and McGregor's scenes are set as flashbacks, but they are fantasized versions of various events in his life. In the present, Finney is terminally ill and his son (Billy Crudup) is set on finding out the real versions of various stories his father had told him over the years. Crudup is frustrated with his father, as he feels that he's never been told the truth about his father's life and that the stories he tells are just too fantastic to be true.His quest for the entirety of the film is to find out the truth about the real stories. Anyway, the flashback/fantasy sequences that feature McGregor are the stories that Finney is telling his son. The story goes back and forth between past and present. The title of the film comes into p lay with the repeated motif of 'big fish in a small pond.' Edward Bloom was just too big and fantastic to be living in small town Alabama.McGregor's fantasy sequences are easily the best and most entertaining sequences of the film. We see him as the star student who can do no wrong; we see him leave his tiny hometown and try to make it elsewhere. He sees his dream girl (Alison Lohman) at a party and spends three years trying to learn about her and find her. He is determined to make her his wife. Along the way, he joins the circus and ends up being employed by Danny DeVito. He also meets a giant and a set of conjoined twins. There is a hilarious scene with Steve Buscemi.Tim Burton stock pl ayer, Helena Bonham Carter is excellent as the girl who harbors a lifelong crush on Ewan McGregor, but ultimately never got him to see her in the same way. Scottish McGregor's attempt at a thick Alabama accent is decent--at least he maintains it throughout the film.This film was so much fun and a nice change of pace from the usual Tim Burton fare. I wish there were more scenes with Ewan McGregor and less scenes with stick-in-the-mud Billy Crudup. This film could have also used more Steve Buscemi--he's hilarious. Jessica Lange also lends support as the older version of Mrs. Bloom and Marion Cotillard appears as Billy Crudup's wife. Recommended.",8,0,0,20 October 2018
Quiz Show," American cynicism regarding its institutions is born
","This has always been one of my favorite movies. I generally have to be 'in the mood' for a particular film, but I will always sit down and watch this one. It seems strange today in this post-Watergate era to believe it could have been considered scandalous at one time for quiz shows to be rigged. For that matter, today, I doubt many people would be surprised if you told them the Congressional hearings on the quiz shows were rigged. That is the level to which our cynicism has progressed. At any rate, this film excels on many levels. To begin with, the cast and performances are just excellent. Turturro excels as the completely unlikeable walking encyclopedia, Herb Stempel. He so badly wants to be admired and successful, but he is just SO unlikeable he doesn't realize that he IS unlikeable. His long-suffering wife played by Johann Carlo sees Herb's every flaw yet loves him anyway. In this he is truly lucky, but he just doesn't see it. Besides his Jewish heritage, Stempel seems to have cluelessness in common with Robert Morrow's Richard Goodwin. Goodwin's character is center stage throughout this movie, and he is played as an exceedingly complex character. First in his class at Harvard, he has brains but lacks the worldliness to see from the beginning that corporate America's Goliath will never be taken down by his version of David and his sling shot of a subpoena. Long before Big Pharma got so big, the fix was already in.In this sense, Goodwin is the personification of the wide-eyed idealist. He still believes if you just present the truth to the public the correct outcome is inevitable. Finally you have Ralph Fiennes as Charles Van Dorn, possibly the most tragic figure in all of this. He goes in to try out for one of NBC's quiz shows with the best of intentions, and ultimately trades his integrity for fame and fortune, although reluctantly at first. Van Dorn at first enjoys the attention and the money, but when Goodwin shows up at his door with a host of questions about the honesty of the quiz shows he seems to reawaken Van Dorn's conscience, and he slowly disintegrates into a pile of nerves who even goes out of his way to avoid the host of admirers he once welcomed. He seems relieved to indict himself before Congress and the nation, but pays a heavy price for his confession. Rounding out the cast is the excellent Paul Scofield as Mark Van Dorn, Charles' father. He is another wide-eyed idealist, and a tall shadow in which Charles has had to dwell until '21' comes along. The master stroke in this film is the cameo by Martin Scorsese as Martin Rittenhome, an executive with Geritol, the sponsor of '21'. His short conversation with Richard Goodwin pretty much lays out the ugly truth of the situation - People do tune in to watch the money, and the same end could be accomplished by merely making the questions easier. He also mentions that the public has a short memory but corporations do not, and is thus confident that the NBC employees who rigged the show will never implicate anyone higher than themselves at any hearing. This fictional composite character is right at every turn, and the dishonored NBC employees even return to TV in the 60's with an even bigger hit - 'The Joker's Wild' - something that would have never happened if they hadn't been willing to be the fall guys.",10,1,1,7 February 2010
The Dark Knight," Perfect balance between action and drama with an unforgettable villain
","Although I don't think it is the fourth best movie ever made, as it is rated according to IMDb, I do think it stands head and shoulders above its super-hero peers, mainly because it is NOT a superhero movie. Batman is a mere mortal with lots of time to train himself physically and money to design the nifty gadgets he uses.Everybody on earth has seen this film, so no use regurgitating the plot. I think Heath Ledger's rendition of The Joker is a masterpiece. Every time he leaves the screen I keep waiting for him to come back. Ledger should have won the best actor Oscar rather than supporting actor, because this is really a two leading man film - Bale as Batman and Ledger as The Joker. I always liked Jack Nicholson's rendition of the Joker in the 1989 film directed by Tim Burton, but Ledger just blows Nicholson's performance away. Maybe it is because Nicholson's Joker had a past and an explanation for his behavior, maybe it is because, after all, Nicholson's Joker just seems to be the wild side of the real Jack Nicholson where Heath Ledger never steps out of character for the entire film. Ledger's Joker is like the devil decides to become incarnate, but unlike Ray Milland's devil in 'Alias Nick Beal' shows his true self - somebody who wants to break the spirits of people, to turn them on one another, to wantonly destroy property, people, whatever. That's reinforced when the police can find no name, no past, no prints, no DNA, not even a label in his clothes when they arrest him. His past is a great big question mark. I like Michael Caine's Alfred - it's good to have someone with relevant past combat and guerrilla experience be a wise father figure to Wayne in this role rather than just a kindly museum piece. Likewise, Morgan Freeman is pitch perfect as Lucius and Wayne's version of Q - somebody who invents his gadgets and runs his business since this really is not where Wayne's mind is, Freeman gives the performance the perfect balance of humor, business acumen, and conscience. And finally I like the fact that Rachel, Bruce Wayne's love interest, is not played by someone who is some unrealistic 10.5/10. She's a cute girl, but her attributes lie in her mind and her heart as well.The negatives - I think Harvey's transformation into Two Face is a little too pat. I don't know why Batman has a totally different voice from Bruce Wayne. Is he doing that on purpose? And I think I found one editing error. Gordon in the end talks about how hard it will be to cover up Harvey/ Two Face's murders including 'two cops'. Harvey let crooked cop Ramirez live and just knocked her out. But if she had lived then Gordon and Batman's plan to cover up Harvey's crimes would never have worked because she would have known what happened. So which scene was wrongly included/scripted? I'd recommend it as one of the better films made since the turn of the century that was also a blockbuster.",10,0,0,2 October 2017
Men in Black," Will Smith saves the planet again ... this time in a good film!
","After the horribly cheesy 'Independence Day' of the previous year, it was great to see the actor that saved that movie from being completely unwatchable - Will Smith - get a chance to save the planet in a quality film. From the opening of the film where 'Mikey', an illegal alien from another planet is disguised as an illegal alien from another country, to the end when we see the earth just as a marble in a pouch of many belonging to an extraterrestrial being, I found this film to be thought provoking, original, and very funny.Tommy Lee Jones (Agent K) and Will Smith (Agent J) are perfect in their roles. Not since Lenny Briscoe and Mike Logan were partners on 'Law and Order' has the young cop/old cop routine been done so well with such great chemistry and deadpan humor. All of the supporting roles work too. Rip Torn is great as Zed, the head of the secret government organization - the 'Men In Black' - who are in charge of overseeing the visits of extraterrestrials who have chosen to establish contact with earth and in some cases become semi-permanent residents of this planet. His great one-liners include telling a group of rejected job applicants - who really don't know what kind of job they've applied for - 'Congratulations gentlemen. You are all we've come to expect from years of government training'.Some of the rank and file employees of the agency are aliens themselves. Unmotivated and not particularly loyal, they enjoy hanging out in the break room drinking coffee, smoking heavily, and collecting cheap miniatures of the Statue of Liberty. Vincent D'Onofrio is also outstanding in the dual role of Edgar, a human who gets eaten by a malicious alien cockroach, and also as the cockroach himself as he tools around New York City in his 'brand new Edgar suit' - Edgar's skin - in an attempt to appear human while trying to start an intergalactic war.Any human who happens to encounter an alien won't remember it thanks to the neuralizer - a device the size of a fountain pen - that the 'Men In Black' administer to erase any resulting memories. This includes employees of the agency themselves, should they choose to quit or retire. The underlying purpose of all of this covering up makes sense when Smith's character, during his orientation session, tells Tommy Lee Jones that he thinks that people could handle the truth about aliens living among them. Jones' (Agent K's) response is: 'A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky animals and you know it.' This is hard to argue with when you think about the acts that people throughout history have performed as a mob that they would never have done as individuals. I really enjoyed this film, and its smart humor has held up over the years. I think in the future many will wonder, as I still do, why this film didn't get a nod at the Academy Awards other than its award for best makeup, at the very least for the screenplay.",9,8,9,5 February 2010
Singin' in the Rain," Now that's entertainment!
","Singin In the Rain is arguably the best movie musical of all time, not just because of the music but because of the entire package - the premise, the comedy, the characters - everything here works together to make you feel better any time you sit down to watch it. It's ironic that this movie was thrown together quickly to capitalize on the success of 'An American in Paris', since the improvisational feeling of the movie is one of the things that makes it so much fun. Although this film is number ten on the top 100 films of all time as compiled by the American Film Institute, it wasn't nominated for best picture the year of its release, 1952. Although it did well at the box office, it would be over twenty years before people would look back and realize just what a great motion picture it was. Perhaps that was because the 1970's were such bleak and cynical years, with movies that largely matched that mood, that people were eager to rediscover the fun that a motion picture viewing experience could be.The movie focuses on that period of time in which the entire motion picture film industry was in nervous transition from silent to talking pictures. Although the movie compresses time in this respect - the transition actually took about three years - it does accurately describe the technical problems of that era along with their comical aspects. There was an overabundance of musicals in the first batch of talking films, many stars did have heavy accents that made their speech undecipherable or voices that came across like nails on a chalkboard like Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) and saw their careers ruined, and early sound technology itself was so fragile that you would often see actors speaking to potted plants or to coat racks with comic effect. The preview of silent picture team Lockwood and Lamont's first talkie, 'The Dueling Cavalier', is one of the most hilarious scenes in the film. It is pretty typical of what you would see in such an early talking picture - dialogue going in and out of sync, actors and actresses strutting around and wildly gesturing as if nobody can hear them, and dialogue that still resembled what you would read off of the title cards in a silent film - 'I love you, I love you, I love you'.All of this is one of the reasons Singin' In The Rain will never get dated - it is a comic nostalgic look at a very narrow period in time. This movie is fun outside of its comic take on movie history, though. For one, it's hard to say who steals the show the most, since there are so many thieves involved. Most notably there is Jean Hagen - who actually has a very pleasant speaking voice - as the evil silent star who can't accept her days are numbered. Then there is a 27 year-old Donald O'Connor as Cosmo, the studio music director and sidekick of Gene Kelly's character whose youthful exuberance really shines in the number 'Make 'Em Laugh' along with all of his goofy facial expressions. He seems to be having as much fun as the audience. Finally, there are all of the great dance numbers and music, capped by probably one of the most famous scenes of all time - Gene Kelly's rendition of the title number that perfectly captures the joy of a man who has just fallen in love and feels he has the world at his feet. You just can't watch this film and not come away with a smile on your face. It is as good for the soul as chicken soup, just a lot more fun.",10,5,6,2 January 2011
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Absolute power corrupts absolutely
","This film has both Jim Carrey and Kate Winsett playing roles that you are probably unaccustomed to seeing them in. Jim Carrey plays plain-vanilla introvert Joel and Winsett plays extroverted salesgirl Clementine who likes to express herself by dying her hair an odd combination of colors and dressing up potatoes like Barbie Dolls. At the time he meets Clementine, Joel is living with someone named Naomi that he mentions several times during the film in only positive terms as 'very nice'. Joel must be searching for something other than 'very nice' since this doesn't prevent him from throwing over this woman that the audience never sees for the unpredictable unknown quantity, Clementine. However, eventually the relationship ends so badly for this mismatched couple that Clementine has all memory of their relationship erased from her mind by a company that has the technology to provide such a service.When Joel discovers what she has done he is so hurt that he wants the same thing done to him so that he can erase the pain. The process takes an entire night, and during this process Joel relives all of the moments he and Clementine had together and realizes that Clementine brought enough happiness into his life that he doesn't want her erased from his mind after all. However, he is now unconscious and unable to communicate his wishes to those handling the procedure. Thus, he tells Clementine - inside his mind - what is going on and they attempt to hide from the 'mind erasers' in places in his memories where he would have never taken her. Specifically, he takes her to particularly humiliating points in his childhood and adolescence. It seems telling that the pair have been together for two years yet Joel has apparently never told Clementine about any of these memories, apparently having shut her out of selective portions of his life. However, these evasion tactics are no match for the mind-erasing team of Lacuna Inc., and ultimately Clementine is cleansed from Joel's mind. Just before the last memory of her is erased, she tells Joel to meet her in a particular spot that was special to both of them. The next day he awakes, is drawn to this prearranged meeting place for reasons he doesn't understand, and she is there. Neither one of them knows who the other is, but the relationship is beginning to start all over again when a disgruntled Lacuna employee gives them their files, which include tapes of what both Joel and Clementine thought of one another at the the time each requested to have the other erased. They listen to each others tapes and are both shocked and embarrassed. These are not flattering revelations, to say the least. Will they decide to part before all of these awful things start happening all over again, or will they take a chance? Watch and find out.The plot may be hard to follow as it bends back and forth through time, but it is worth it, and Jim Carrey gives the best performance he has given since 'The Truman Show'. The movie has a lot to say about how we are the product of our memories and our choices - both the bad and the good. It also illustrates how absolute power corrupts through the unconscionable actions of some of the employees of Lacuna Inc. who start out helping people and end up helping themselves. You'll find yourself catching something you missed before each time you watch it. I highly recommend this film.",10,8,12,19 September 2010
Avatar," Mediocre in every aspect but the technical ones
","This is not the worst movie ever made, but it's not something that will change the direction of cinema either, and it's definitely not something I would want to sit through a second time. Like Cameron's Titanic it will largely be forgotten in ten years to the point that people in the future will just not believe all of the hype that went on at the time it was in theaters.Cameron is brilliant with special effects and technology, but he's a good businessman with a sense of showmanship too, and thus he realizes that if he simply made a documentary entitled 'How I Did It' and showed off and explained how he produced some of his pioneering technological tricks, that nobody but a few dozen geeks such as myself would buy a ticket to see it.Thus a narrative is added - usually an obvious and emotionally manipulative one - to draw in the largest audience. That was what was done in Titanic, and that is the case here. I can't say that Cameron plagiarized the story either, because he's also a master at taking known story lines and putting them through a blender where you can at no point say this is a retread of any one story. However, it is retread of several well known ones. I won't tell you which stories or else I might give the plot away to the few people left on this planet who haven't seen Avatar and still intend to do so.My recommendation - see it or don't see it. This one won't change your life.",6,7,12,28 July 2010
There's Something About Mary," This movie could easily make you dislke men!...
","... because just about every man in the film is a liar. In 1985 Ted (Ben Stiller) is a geeky teenager who has a crush on beautiful Mary (Cameron Diaz). He asks her out to the prom, and she accepts. But before they can even go on their date disaster strikes in every possible, unintentional, and humiliating way for Ted, and the date never happens.Thirteen years later, Ted still can't get Mary off of his mind and decides to hire a detective to look for her. What follows is a hilarious and rather gross tale of deceit between Mary's suitors and between the suitors and Mary, all carrying things to the point of the ridiculous to win the love of Mary. And then there is the mysterious 'Brett', Mary's old boyfriend, who doesn't make an appearance until the end. All the time Mary is delightfully clueless to be so smart - she's an orthopedic surgeon.There are supporting almost cameo appearances by Markie Post of 'Night Court' fame as Mary's mother, Keith David as Mary's rather angry stepfather - at Ted not Mary , W. Earl Brown as Mary's mentally handicapped brother, and Lin Shaye as Mary's neighbor with the shoe leather tan who is playing the same kind of 'gross out' role that she played in the Farrelly Brothers' film 'Kingpin'.Along the way is a stalker with a shoe fetish, the shooting of a minstrel where the bullet was meant for Ted, a mass murderer, a yorkshire terrier with the engine and fortitude of twelve rottweilers, and a great music video of the song I will forever associate with this film - 'Build Me Up Buttercup'.Highly recommended for people who know when not to take things so seriously. It still cheers me up over twenty years later.",8,2,3,26 December 2018
Woman in Gold," Fascinating story brought down a little by some cliches
","Thiis film is about an elderly Jewish woman, living in LA, who fled the Nazis Following the death of her sister, she attempts to reclaim the magnificent Klimt paintings, including the painting in the title, looted by the Nazis from her family home in Vienna and now in one of Vienna's great museums.The film is about the woman's coming to terms with her past and the attempt to see justice done; and also about her young lawyer's growing awareness about his past. He is the grandson of the Austrian-Jewish composer Arnold Schoenberg, who also fled the Nazis.I liked the film, which received mixed reviews. There are a few annoying cliches, particularly in the relationship between the young lawyer and his wife. Some reviewers said the film was a dull movie about a fascinating true story, but I didn't find it dull at all. Helen Mirren was excellent as the lead, Maria Altmann, who died in Los Angeles in 2011 at the age of 94. The title painting now hangs in the Neue Galerie in New York City.",7,7,11,26 August 2018
The Fly," A masterpiece of horror that is not better than the original, just different
","When I first heard they were remaking 'The Fly' over 30 years ago I rolled my 20-something eyes and figured this would be some inferior remake with lots of gore. I was half right. There is lots of gore, but there is so much more going on. The first half is basically a sci fi/romance combo. Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum), a rather socially backwards genius of a scientist meets science journalist Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis) at a press event she is covering. He takes her back to his warehouse apartment/laboratory and demos the teleportation device he has been working on. His problem - he can transport inanimate objects but nothing living. Later he comes to her office and proposes that they collaborate. He wants her to document his work in progress. All of this time together leads to a romance that is good for both of them. Seth gets a taste of 'the flesh' as he calls it, and Veronica loses the cynicism she has developed about love. You see, Veronica's boss, Stathis Borans (John Getz), is an ex-lover of Veronica's who is trying to get her back. Today we'd call the guy a stalker. Why would you continue to work for a stalker? That is never explained. He lets himself into her apartment to take a shower, shows up in a store when she is buying Seth a new jacket, and sends her insulting fake magazine covers he has made up concerning Seth and herself.One night Seth figures out that Veronica has had an affair with Borans, and he gets drunk in his despair, thinking that maybe the affair is ongoing. Since Seth has the romantic experience of an eighth grader, this is understandable. But then the tragic drunken decision to go ahead and transport himself as the first human experiment. Except something tags along - a fly.Unlike the 1958 film, there is no half fly-half human something that emerges from the pod. Instead, at first, Brundle doesn't know what has happened, and he emerges looking exactly the same as before he was transported. He even seems better for it - stronger, quicker reflexes, more stamina, and this pesky desire for sugary foods. Instead the transformation is gradual, heartbreaking even, as a man finds he is losing himself. Veronica turns to Borans for help, who truly does try to help in this unbelievable situation.Yet Stathis is not the hero. Brundle is definitely the hero, albeit a tragic one. For the most part the horror of the movie doesn't come from seeing 'BrundleFly' terrorize other people. Instead it comes from empathizing with him as we see the gruesome transformation he undergoes as he loses everything he cares about. Goldblum and Davis give fantastic performances and get you invested in their relationship really quickly. Watching it all get destroyed is heartbreaking. They were actually a couple at the time this film was made, and their chemistry is palpable.Highly recommended as everything about it holds up today. I should know since I watched it again last night when I woke up at 2AM when it showed up on one of the Encore cable channels. The tragedy and the horror of it all kept me up until dawn.One more thing - director David Cronenberg does a cameo as a gynecologist. His 1988 film 'Dead Ringers' was about two gynecologists. Does Cronenberg have a thing for gynecology? Just wondering.",9,7,9,20 July 2017
How to Train Your Dragon," One of my favorite films of the last decade...
","...not that this is necessarily saying much, since the films of the past decade are either made for the Academy Awards with some social message that hits the audience over the head with a social justice sledgehammer, or they are action films with lots of car chases and explosions and comic book heroes or they are 50 shades of obscene. But I digress. This animated film is beautiful to watch, but that is not the main drawing point. The drawing point are the characters. Even though this is set in some fictitious land full of Vikings beset with fire breathing dragons who are always raiding their livestock, you can easily relate to everybody. The main character, Hiccup, is the son of the warrior king of the Vikings. Hiccup is mild mannered, lanky, awkward - your typical teen of about age 14. He likes to build and invent things. Dad wants his son to be a dragon slayer. So one day, during an attack by the dragons, Hiccup actually catches one with one of his inventions. He grabs a knife and runs into the forest to kill the dragon to make dad happy. But he just can't. This 'fearsome' dragon is tame, passive, dog-like before people had dogs. And so 'Toothless' as Hiccup names him, becomes like a pet to Hiccup. The pair develop this beautiful unbreakable bond. And Hiccup learns about dragons.Hiccup is signed up for Dragon Killing class with the rest of the island's teens. Hiccup quickly rises to the top of his class but manages to not kill even one dragon. Instead he uses the techniques of bonding with dragons that he has learned from Toothless to subdue them into harmless pets. Nobody questions what is going on but Astrid, a tomboyish teen girl who just knows Hiccup is up to something.This film has genuine laughs, thrills, the real problems of sons and fathers disappointing and misunderstanding one another, the awkwardness of that first romance, and the idea that sometimes your enemy may be your enemy for reasons you don't understand. I watched this for about the tenth time last night and I have to say it just never gets old. Highly recommended.",9,0,0,13 May 2018
Rocky," The tortoise and the hare coupled with Georgie Girl
","Yes, this film is cute, upbeat, and likable. But the plot is so obvious and clichéd. Heavyweight champion Apollo Creed needs a boxing partner for his next fight and it is decided to give an average joe boxer the chance to win the title on January 1, 1976, the 200th anniversary of the United States declaring independence. Well actually that would be July 4, but I won't quibble. That average joe is 3rd rate boxer Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) who makes ends meet by collecting for a mobster.Rocky only has eyes for cripplingly shy plain Adrian (Talia Shire) who works in the pet store. Adrian lives with her alcoholic bully of a brother, Paulie, who is a butcher and friends with Rocky. It would be easy to scratch your head and ask why Rocky never gave up pursuing Adrian who, if she wasn't disinterested, was so shy she might never come out of her shell. But Rocky saw himself as a diamond in the rough, regardless of other people's opinions, and I think he took the time to realize this young woman was a diamond in the rough too if only she would come out of that shell.Now everybody who can disrespects Rocky - the driver of the mobster he works for is always insulting him, a neighborhood girl who is hanging out with the bad kids is given an endearing lecture by Rocky about girls who have bad 'reps' only to have her make an obscene gesture as they part after walking home, and most of all Mick (Burgess Meredith), who runs the local gym, is always yelling at Rocky about what a loser he is.When it becomes known that Rocky has been given a shot at the title, suddenly people want a piece of him. Mick comes to him and wants to be his manager. Rocky is not stupid. He realizes the difference in treatment is because of the opportunity he has been given, and if not for that people would still be walking on him. The scene between him and Mick where Rocky explodes with resentment is really good acting by Stallone.So Rocky does ultimately let Mick train him, and the scene of Rocky running after Mick after Rocky at first threw him out of his apartment is shot from a distance, so we never know what was said, and that again is good filmmaking. Rocky takes the whole thing seriously while Creed is too busy with public appearances to train.In parallel with Rocky's training is his romance with Adrian who transforms from a plain looking girl into a stylish pretty girl. This is one of those obvious things because Talia Shire was not an unknown. She was in the Godfather for Pete's sake, so the audience knows she is not ugly. Just don't style her hair, dress her drably, no makeup and some geeky looking glasses and voila - the ugly duckling. Rocky's unconditional love gives her confidence to dress well and present herself attractively.So the big day comes, Rocky has done his homework, Creed hasn't really prepared, expecting this to be a three round publicity stunt. Adrian has changed so much that nobody who knew her three months ago could recognize her in a lineup. How does all of this end up? Watch and find out.I don't think this was the Best Picture of 1976, but it was probably the most upbeat of the A pictures that came out that year. Look at its competition - 'All The President's Men' which was about Watergate, 'Network' about a bloodless television executive who will do anything for ratings, 'Taxi Driver' about a psychologically troubled ex-marine, and 'Bound For Glory' about a folk singer of the Depression era who died of just about the worst disease on earth. Maybe the Academy just wanted to pick a feel good film, and Rocky was the only one that fit that bill.",6,10,16,29 April 2017
Beauty and the Beast," A remake that was well done
","As much as it pains me to see movies being remade, I find that I am able to give Disney a pass for this. I thoroughly enjoyed Beauty and the Beast . I have been a fan of Emma Watson's, since first watching the 'Harry Potter' series several years ago. It is evident she is not a strong singer, but her singing was pleasant enough. I think I doubted Disney's decision to cast her as Belle, but after seeing the movie, I feel as if those doubts have been put to rest.I also thought the rest of the casting was well done. Dan Stevens of Downton Abbey fame was great as The Beast (in this version, he even gets to sing a song) and Kevin Kline was great as Maurice, Belle's father. Emma Thompson never fails to impress me. She was one of the people I was extremely glad was cast in this film. She did Angela Lansbury proud. Josh Gad (Lefou) is perhaps most famous for portraying the lovable snowman, Olaf, in Disney's 2013 animated film, 'Frozen' (although I knew him mainly from the raunchy Broadway show, 'Book of Mormon,' but that's a story for another time). Luke Evans (Gaston): I am not as familiar with him; the only film of his I've seen is 'Dracula: Untold.' He was pretty good as well. Ian McKellen and Ewan McGregor were wonderful as usual. The one I was impressed with the most, was 6-time Tony winner Audra McDonald. I have been a fan of hers since the year 2000 when I first watched Disney's 'Annie', and she never fails to amaze me with her consistency and overall talent. Her voice was, by far, the best in the movie.The cinematography and special effects were obviously all there. When you get a huge company like Disney behind a product, they naturally have all the money and the resources available to make the best quality motion picture in the technical aspects that they want.Give this movie a try, it was truly beautiful.",7,6,11,5 April 2017
Titanic," Ignores the fact that women in 1912 - rich and poor - were pretty much property
","The special effects are great in this film, and the love story is compelling. Even though there is no uncertainty as to how this movie plays out, it is still quite dramatic and interesting. Plus, you have to marvel at a movie that managed to win the Academy Award for best picture and was also a huge box office hit - a distinction shared with few films over the last twenty years.However, there are a few oversimplifications of the social situation of the passengers in the context of the realities of the early 20th century that bug me every time I watch this movie. First off, there is a heavy handed message of rich = bored and unhappy, poor = genuine and full of life. Given that there was absolutely no social safety net anywhere in the world in 1912, there could be nothing more brutal and grinding than being poor in that era, as if there is any such thing as 'easy poverty' at any point in history, including today.Second, and somewhat accompanying the first sticking point, is the idea that Rose will somehow be free to be something out of a 1969 Virginia Slim's commercial if only she can lose that rich stiff she is engaged to (Billy Zane's character, Cal) and run off with kindred free-spirit Jack. This illusion not only confronts the fact of grinding poverty in early 20th century America, this flies in the face of entrenched sexism enshrined in the law during that time that wasn't even confronted as a problem until the 1960's. Who, in 1912, is going to let Rose put on a pair of jeans and ride side-saddle on Coney Island? Let her learn to pilot a plane? Allow her to pursue her career goals unless they involve teaching school, nursing, or performing (i.e. doing something that involves serving men)? And even learning those skills cost money she did not have. The fact is at that time a woman in America or anywhere else in the world was considered property. She could either be the property of a rich man (evil Cal) or a poor man. The only main character in this movie that seems to be facing facts is Rose's mother who shows genuine terror at the idea of being poor again - and she SHOULD be afraid, VERY afraid.I once had a 3rd sticking point, but it has been nullified over the last ten years. That sticking point was that Billy Zane's character could feel so superior and entitled given that his wealth and stature were accidents of birth, not the fruits of his own enterprise and imagination. I have since come to realize that some of the smuggest most entitled people on earth are those that were born into their circumstances, so I withdraw that objection.This movie did do a service by dispelling the myth that the slogan on the Titanic was 'women and children first', when it was, in fact, 'first class women and children first'. In reality, if you were a first-class woman, you had a 97% chance of survival, and just about every first class woman that did die chose to stay behind because she did not want to leave her husband. If you were a female steerage passenger you had about a 45% chance of survival. Worse yet, third class children had a 1 in 3 chance of survival, which was the same rate of survival as the first class men. Not one of either the first or second class children died on the Titanic.Thus, I still enjoy the movie immensely, but I think that the false presentation of early 20th century social reality will always bother me a little every time I watch the film.",7,18,114,12 November 2009
The Shape of Water," The actual screenplay can leave you feeling there are gaps...
","... but this is a make-believe fairy tale, and thus expects the audience to accept the simplicity of 'and they fell in love, and lived happily forever after'. It's not supposed to go into the deep intricacies and nuances of their relationship--she loves him, he loves her, that's it. I think that story-telling, especially fairy tales, ask us to just accept 'love at first sight' as being a thing, so you have to watch the film from that perspective--the first time Eliza sees The Asset in containment, she's fallen in love. It's worth noting that all the lives of the characters outside of Eliza and The Asset are not fairy tales--Giles doesn't get the guy, and he doesn't redeem himself at work. Zelda spends much of her time complaining about the dysfunctional marriage she's in, and Mr. Strickland is the most obvious contrast: he's living the literal embodiment of the American Dream, and it tears him apart, makes him evil and sick inside. Then there is Bob, who's trying his best to live out his life as a spy thriller despite being caught, literally, with his pants down. The movie asks you to root for Eliza and The Asset because among all these failed fairy tales they've found theirs, and you want to root for their happily ever after.It's worth noting that the film comments on their relationship being difficult to understand: Octavia Spencer's character, Zelda, tells her husband that he wouldn't understand the two of them, not if he tried his whole life.There is one final twist to all of this that just makes the film complete, and even makes the fairy tale make sense . If you have just seen trailers you need to see it to the end.",9,8,12,18 October 2018
The Untouchables," I pretty much spend my time in a perpetual eye roll when watching this.
","There is so much blatant emotional manipulation of the audience going on here that I stood and applauded when director DePalma crashed and burned with 'Bonfire of the Vanities' three years later. Justice delayed is better than nothing.First, what's great about this film? The casting is wonderful. DeNiro gives the best interpretation of Al Capone I've seen on film, capturing the essence of a guy who enjoys being the darling of the media and perceived as a sophisticated clever businessman - the first dapper Don you might say - but at his core he is a murderous thug with an uncontrollable temper. There's a very young Andy Garcia as the uncorrupted rookie chosen as one of the untouchables, and then there is Sean Connery who won an Oscar for his performance as a cop, Jim Malone, tired of the good fight because he feels it just can't be won given the tide of money fueling all of the violence and corruption, and just wants to wait out his time walking a beat until his pension comes due until Ness comes along. I'll get back to Kevin Costner later.What's bad? The entire screenplay and its execution. If it's not just lying there it is trying to emotionally manipulate you, primarily with enforcer Frank Nitti doing what Capone is too important to do now - killing off lovable characters with a smile on his face. The film just can't let the conclusion be about the novel way in which Capone is brought down, it has to have a fight to the death involving Capone's surrogate Frank Nitti and Elliot Ness - a fight that never happened. Nitti met death at his own hand in 1943. And don't get me started on weird pieces of dialogue that don't even seem to mean anything. Example: Connery's character has just clubbed a mob guy as the untouchables burst in on a bootleg operation. He says as the mob guy lies there unconscious 'How do you think he feels now - better or worse?' Huh??? What does that even mean? Then there is Patricia Clarkson as Mrs. Ness playing this entire thing like her husband is Ward Cleaver going off to sell insurance every day, not battle a band of killers. She's got this weird constantly smiling Stepford Wife vibe going that is just over the top strange given the situation.Finally, let me talk about Costner as Elliott Ness. The portrayal he gives is one of a guy who initially starts this assignment because he's told to do so, because 'it is the law gentlemen', and he makes a complete mess of it. Only when some comrades fall in battle combined with the tutorage of Connery's Jim Malone on strategy, does Ness become effective at his job. At the end, when the fight is done, and he's put away Capone, the press asks Ness what he'll do after Prohibition is repealed. Ness says he'll have a drink. Again, huh??? No more reflection than this on the irony of the entire situation? In fact, the Untouchables era was the peak of Elliott Ness' career. Afterwards his marriage collapsed, his career stalled, and he failed at about everything he tried, so maybe Ness was indeed this hapless guy without a star, and thus Costner's portrayal would have been spot on rather than just a stiff poorly directed one.",5,12,23,28 September 2012
It's a Wonderful Life," Haven't we all at some point on the way home ...
","... arrived at our exit on the freeway and wondered, 'What if I just kept driving?'. That very modern - and yet timeless - feeling is at the heart of this film, before life was so complex, when the U.S. was dotted with small towns in which it was possible to be born, make a good living, and die, without ever leaving, save for military service.George Bailey is both an extraordinarily lucky and unlucky guy. He's unlucky because none of the plans he made for himself as a young man ever worked out - his loyalties to family and to his hometown always kept him pinned there. He's extraordinarily lucky because he has a wife and children that adore him. But one Christmas Eve when he is in his late 30's a crisis brought about by his uncle's stupidity is the last straw that causes him to wish that he was never born, and he gets that wish granted to him - to see the world as if he had never been born, and he does not like the view.It turns out over his life, George did a series of good deeds - some large some small - that changed the course of just about every life in his hometown. Basically, without the Bailey Savings and Loan, which without George would have collapsed in the 1920's at the death of his father, the only source of financing is Mr. Potter's bank, which makes Citibank look like a charitable institution. The town has thus been thrown into chaos, a place where alcoholism, prostitution, and broken homes abound. Now I could sympathize with George's horror at seeing the bad fate of just about everybody he knew save Mary, his wife. When George inquires about her fate he is told - 'You won't like it. She's an OLD MAID'! Oh the horror! She in fact is the town librarian. To quote someone else on this subject - 'in a town thrown into chaos she's an educated woman with a job - what's the problem?'. Mary, before she even married George, is full of life and has a sense of style, but just subtract George from her existence and she becomes someone who dresses like a woman twenty years her senior and is deathly frightened of men? Pleeeease! Oh well, if I am going to watch the films of 1946 I'd better be prepared to deal with the values of 1946, but I digress.The fact is George probably WOULD have been better off without these ties that bind. He could have seen the world and done big things and slept like a baby without a worry. But the fact is he realized he cared about these people whose lives would be ruined without him, and that is probably why so many of us don't just keep driving when we hit our exit on the highway. We go home to the people we love and the problems that come with them.",9,9,14,25 December 2014
A Beautiful Mind," Crowe should have won the Best Actor Oscar for this film
","Crowe does a great job of playing mathematical whiz John Nash who always had a hard time dealing with people, partially because he just didn't get them, partially because social niceties were just beside the point to him. But Nash had big dreams due to his mathematical genius until schizophrenia stole those dreams. What is great about this film is that the viewer does not know that Nash's imaginary friends are imaginary until the film reveals that fact. What is real to Nash is real to the audience, up to a point.His wife is not made out to be some kind of saint. She is frank after John is released from the hospital in that she mainly feels obligation. The anti psychotic drugs John is on make him unable to respond to her sexually, unable to carry on with his work in mathematics, unable to do much more than sit at home and stare. This is not what she signed up for, yet she stays.And after several months of this, John makes a decision to stop taking the anti-psychotic drugs, try to deal with the illusions with will and with work, and try to scratch and claw his way back into mathematics. In the 1950s he is actually allowed back on campus at Princeton where he once was faculty. Today, insurance and legal issues would take that out of the hands of Princeton itself.It's ultimately the story of how a man has to 'cut one's coat according to one's cloth', as the old saying goes, of maybe not lowered expectations as much as slower expectations brought on by unforeseeable circumstances and obstacles.A couple of minor things I really noticed were some touches Ron Howard put into the film. One is how as the years rolled on from the 1950s into the late 1960s young people were just ruder in general. Some of the students start mimicking Nash and his odd gait for laughs. So I guess a growing lack of empathy was part of social progress? The second thing is the reality that in the mid 20th century doctors really believed in insulin shock therapy, even though it is now known to be meaningless torture. What you are actually doing is taking somebody who is not diabetic and giving them insulin which induces seizures. It has been known to lead to coma and death in actual insulin dependent diabetics who end up with an overdose due to their body just absorbing insulin and excreting their own insulin slightly differently than is normal for them day to day.Do realize this is not exactly the story of John Nash's life. He had a first marriage that he walked out on after his wife became pregnant. His second wife, Alicia, divorced him after six years of marriage in 1963. They did remarry in 2001. And Crowe definitely does not sound like he is from West Virginia, which was Nash's birthplace. But then all of these details would have been distracting and made the characters less sympathetic. After all, if I want to see the unvarnished truth about John Nash I should watch a PBS documentary, not a Hollywood movie!But back to Crowe. Although every part of this film is well crafted, his performance is the heart of the film. I believe him when he is being a jerk, when he is a socially clueless romantic clumsily courting his wife, when he is afraid for his life, afraid for his sanity, afraid for the nothingness his life could become post diagnosis, and I believe his immersion into mathematics as he battles bravely to come back to the field that he loves.I'd highly recommend this one as one of the more accessible 21st century Oscar winners. It is truly a classic.",9,3,3,18 October 2019
Psycho," Always holds me from beginning to end...
","...from the first time I saw it at age 14 until today whenever I run across it.This is the rare example of a much-ballyhooed film that is truly deserving of all the hype surrounding it. It would have been nice to have experienced the film without any knowledge of the plot twists. Unfortunately, for most viewers, the big surprises are not possible since so many of the scenes are part of our popular culture.There were, however, so many unexpected surprises. The opening scene with Janet Leigh and John Gavin in the hotel room was amazing and (pardon the cliché) so real. Hitchcock and Janet Leigh did a brilliant job of pulling us into Marion Crane's story, that of a woman in love with a divorced man who might as well be married considering his heavy financial obligations that leave him unable to marry in a practical sense even though he can in a legal sense. He doesn't even have a proper home - just a room in the back of the store he owns. Marion is then seemingly set up as the center of the movie as she thinks she has found a solution to her problems - a felonious one. Then the focus is skillfully shifted to the Norman Bates character as the 'protagonist' victimized by his insane mother (or so it seemed) and then the focus is shifted once again to Marion's sister's search. The movie was adapted from a novel so some of the original audience would have been familiar with the plot of the book. In the novel, Norman Bates was a middle-aged man. I think it was a brilliant stroke to have the Norman of the film as a man in his twenties, a boy who never grew up in a man's body. Anthony Perkins is so identified today with his role of Norman Bates that it was surprising to see how endearingly he played him in the early scenes. And he did one of the best stammers I've ever seen in a movie when he was being questioned by the private detective (Martin Balsam) who is also searching for Marion. I also wasn't expecting to see how protective the local sheriff and his wife were of Norman when they were being questioned about him and his mother. You could tell they didn't want somebody (Norman) whom they thought had been dealt a bad hand to have anymore publicity and scrutiny than he already had.This film is mentioned in the documentary 'Moguls and Movie Stars' as an example of how films were becoming more like TV as the 60s began - spartan art design and a script that was bold in the amount of sex and violence it had, even if the vast majority is implied. You have to be impressed by the versatility that is Hitchcock. Making movies in England? No problem. Making movies in the American studio system? No problem. Modernizing to deal with the evaporation of the production code? Again, no problem. Weird factoid - for you TCM fans out there Robert Osborne is credited as 'man' in Psycho, although I don't remember him ever mentioning it. The only person it could possibly be unless he never comes close to having his face on camera is the parson as the sheriff and his wife are exiting church. See what you think.",10,26,29,25 March 2017
Steve Jobs," an abstract portrait of the man..
","... in that you can argue about almost every stroke in the painting, yet when you stand back a few feet from the work, you realize that this is a more accurate portrayal of Steve Jobs than any photograph could be.For example, Michael Fassbender looks nothing like Steve Jobs did at any point in his adult life, sounds nothing like Steve Jobs did. Yet, by the end of the film you feel that you are looking right at the man. Why? Because every incident portrayed sounds EXACTLY like something Steve Jobs would have done or said even if the entire incident never happened.Kate Winsett gave an Oscar worthy performance as Joanna Hoffman, Jobs' marketing expertise and confidante, if he had any confidante at all. She acts as his conscience, his anchor, yet she actually wasn't there for a third of the film. Hoffmann retired before Jobs went back to Apple. As for Seth Rogan as Steve Wosniak, what can I say. He blew me away as he stood toe to toe with Fassbender in a show down that took my breath away with its intensity, and he stole the entire scene from Fassbender, proving he is much more than just the comic relief of Judd Apatow films.Jeff Daniels as the conventional CEO John Sculley, recruited by Jobs to deal with a most unconventional visionary in a pioneering industry, absolutely nails the part. The scene towards the middle of the film where Sculley and Jobs have it out is a work of art in itself of dialogue, editing, and acting, and the time shifting between the present and various pasts of their relationship is expertly done.As for the plot? It takes place entirely at three product launches - the Mac in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988, and the iMac in 1998, and the central theme is Jobs' relationship with his daughter Lisa, the paternity of whom he did not come to terms with for years. Of course, if Jobs had even one product launch like the ones in the film with everybody he's ever known approaching and reproaching him, Jobs would have had security like the secret service at every launch afterwards.So don't approach this like a documentary, instead approach it like the art it was meant to be and I think you'll enjoy it greatly. And regardless of what others say, I think it gives the most humane portrayal of Jobs I've seen on film. Strongly recommended.",9,48,68,8 July 2017
A Hard Day's Night," The Beatles were not actors...
","...but they were great entertainers, and this film is great entertainment. This is the best of all of the rock and roll films that feature the actual performers. This picture demonstrates The Beatles at the peak of their popularity in the Summer of 1964- wandering about London- with the ultimate soundtrack in the background. A fascinating homage to Beatlemania when viewed now- over half a century later. The inventive boys from Liverpool are displayed at their sarcastic and witty best in this natural setting. A Hard Day's Night is a great example of the early Beatles musical ability, and work product, being that the title tune was written in about 20min between finishing an American tour, a European tour, a plethora of television specials, recording an LP in Paris in German for the Deutschland market, writing and recording the Hard Day's Night LP as well as making this film all within the same year, and before May of that year. After which, they all went on a month long vacation, recorded another album and began work on the next film. These guys were driven workaholics at this time, and their collective creative synergy has never been seen again.There wasn't anywhere The Beatles could go without being mobbed, thus they spent years boxed up in hotel rooms together to the point where they knew each other so well they often finished each others sentences during interviews. As a group of young men going through that type of stress day in and day out, they had to develop coping skills in order to keep it together, it seems they chose humor as their main tool. This movie shows us a little bit of that. Genius casting is evident in Hard Days Night with the inclusion of Irishman Wilfred Brambell as Paul McCartney's incorrigible Grandfather. Brambell was only 52 at the time but looked 82. At the time Brambell was very well known to British audiences due to the popularity of his television character named Albert Steptoe in a show called Steptoe and Son. Brambell's 1960s character Steptoe was the basis for the Fred Sanford character played by Redd Foxx on the 1970s American TV show 'Sanford and Son'. Look fast for a 13 year old Phil Collins in the audience as a screaming fan and look even faster for 20 year old Pattie Boyd as a schoolgirl on the train ride.",9,7,9,6 October 2016
Scream 2," Not that original but still OK
","This second 'Scream' isn't nearly as original as the first which was a great and suspenseful take on slasher films. This one has the high school victim in the first film - Sidney - now in college studying film. For 99% of the people who major in this, a slow descent into obscurity and realizing that your life will be spent as an admin or working retail, not as a great director, should be revenge enough for anybody. But obviously our killer(s?) is/are not that patient.The beginning is tight, at the opening of a film called 'stab', patterned after the murders in 'Scream', and you just know who the first two victims are going to be, although Craven's direction and the score make it a suspenseful when and where. The ending is good too, and it is different enough from the ending of the first Scream that you do wonder who is up to what, just like in the first. There are some tells though. There are some particularly - at that time - famous players in the film doing bit parts. Why? I'd say, watch and find out. Fortunately, this film was made 22 years ago so you are probably not going to know who was famous then and who is now because of subsequent events unless you are over 50.The worst part is the middle. It is tedious. You've just got some predictable chases and cat-and-mouse games going on, and you feel like it is just there to fill time between the suspenseful beginning and end. Probably worth your time if you run across it, and probably you are not going to enjoy it if you haven't seen the original Scream first.",6,7,10,4 February 2019
"Hail, Caesar!"," You'd need to know something about cinematic history to completely get it BUT...
","... it really is a 'Tale of the Christ' in allegory. Eddie Mannix is 'the fixer' for a Hollywood movie studio, Capitol Pictures. His story is supposed to be in parallel with that of the Christ. This is not at all obvious. I had to watch it a couple of times - a couple of times in which I was actually trying to pick up all of the pieces of Hollywood history - to actually get it. Eddie is trying to quit smoking, and he is continually going to confession about his failures in this area. The devil is actually Lockheed, which offers Eddie a tempting offer to abandon his 'flock' - the stars he looks after - in return for an easy job and financial security. He's got a family - wife and two kids - and television is on its way. What will he do? In the meantime Eddie's 'flock', the stars of Capitol Pictures, are modelled after Hollywood history of the year in which this is set - 1951. Eddie is trying to deal with the unwed pregnancy of an Esther Williams clone, who curses, smokes (while pregnant), and is not at all sure who the father of her child is. Then there is the sudden disappearance of their biggest star, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), without whom 'Hail Caesar' cannot be completed. It makes fun of the singing cowboys, and what happens when you try to install one in a drawing room drama with a snooty directory, and even Carmen Miranda and Tilda Swinton as identical twins and competing gossip columnists - I am assuming she is supposed to be Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons - are lampooned.In this version of 1951, 'the Commies' are real threats, not just boogeymen, and figure largely into the plot.If the Cohens made a mistake here it would be depending upon the audience knowing about old Hollywood and getting the allegory of Eddie Mannix as the Christ. You could watch and enjoy 'Fargo' and know nothing about Minnesota, you could watch and enjoy 'Blood Simple' and 'Raising Arizona' and know nothing about the American southwest, but it might be tough going to watch this and get all of the jokes and plot points and know nothing of the history of Old Hollywood.",7,1,1,28 January 2017
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Quite good for its genre...
","...that genre being 'manly men behaving stupidly'. Its charm is in the fact that it is not pretending to be anything other than what it is - it does not try to get you to do anything other than laugh. The film is also responsible for giving Steve Carell his breakthrough role as Brick, the news weatherman who can hardly assemble a coherent sentence.The film centers around Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell), a local news anchorman in San Diego at an unspecified time. From the fashions and music, it could be anytime between 1968 and 1975. Ron is basically a lecherous yet likable leisure suit Larry who is mainly a face - he has no real journalistic talents or instincts. He simply reads the news that others report. The trouble begins when the station manager hires a new newswoman, Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) who at first is given only fluff pieces to do. The big step forward for Veronica is that she is working as a reporter at all. This was considered women's lib in 1970 - just being admitted to the club. This did not exempt you from all kinds of hazing and sexual harassment, which was considered the price of admission. A romance develops between Ron and Veronica that ends quite abruptly when Ron is late to the set and Veronica goes on in his place. She does so well that she and Ron become co-anchors and the war begins - Veronica against every other man in the newsroom, all who feel threatened by a woman anchoring the news. However, Veronica plays it smart and takes advantage of the fact that Ron will say anything that comes across the teleprompter without even thinking about it.Normally I don't like these kinds of films at all, but for some reason this one just gets funnier every time I watch it. Especially funny is the conclusion, with actual investigative reporter Bill Kurtis discussing the destinies of everyone at the station.",8,1,1,24 October 2010
Kingpin," Roy was a great bowler...and then he got Munsoned
","In 1979, to the tune of 'Disco Inferno', Roy Munson (Woody Harrelson) demonstrates that he is the greatest bowler in the world. Except nobody knows this but himself, his dad, and the rest of his small Iowa hometown. So he sets out on the open road to make his fame and fortune in the sport. And then he runs into HIM...Ernie McCracken (Bill Murray). Ernie talks Roy into running a scam with him on some other bowlers, basically a hustle, and when the scam goes bad, Ernie takes a powder and leaves Roy holding the bowling bag. And the scammed - including a preacher - do not take it well. They take revenge by putting Roy's bowling hand into the bowling ball return. You don't actually SEE the gore, but the next scene is Woody in present day (1996) stopping his morning alarm with his extremely fake looking prosthetic hand to the tune of 'It's a Beautiful Morning'.Roy's fortune looks like it might take a turn for the better when he encounters an Amish bowler, Ishmael (Randy Quaid), who has an incredibly high bowling score average. He wants Ishmael to go with him to a one million dollar tournament in Reno. Ishmael won't go because the bowling hobby is a secret from his family, one that his family and the entire Amish community consider sinful.So the rest of the film consists of a hilarious take on the Amish community - ever notice this is the LAST group of people that it is OK to make fun of?, a beautiful but unwanted passenger (Vanessa Angel), and another encounter with HIM - Ernie McCracken, now a successful pro bowler...who still has both of his hands.With Bill Murray as, well, Bill Murray. He's always the same character. We wouldn't want it any other way, at least in a comedy. Also with Lin Shaye as the woman with patent leather skin, an oversexed landlady who is playing the same kind of gross-out role she had in 'Something About Mary'. And about Roy being 'Munsoned', along the way he learns that his last name has become an adjective, meaning 'to have the world in the palm of your hand and blow it'.Sure this film is full of juvenile jokes, but overall it is very funny, plays to the strengths of the cast, and is for everybody who feels like they blew an opportunity in life, which is just about all of us. It's a shame most of the critics at the time didn't get that.",8,6,8,1 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Best of the Star Wars trilogy of prequels...
",".. and that's not saying that much. I think everyone judges every Star Wars movie by what is considered the best of the batch, the original Star Wars of 1977 and 'The Empire Strikes Back' of 1980. Compared with those movies, this movie is not so great. Compared to the other two prequels, it is the best of the three. It turns away from the tortuous details of Senate politics that infected its predecessor, 'Attack of the Clones', and tries to get back to the action, relationships, and moral dilemmas that are at the heart of the 'Star Wars' series. However, this film has many flaws that could have been eradicated with more of a conscientious effort by creator, director, and writer George Lucas.It basically forms a straight line, plot-wise, from Episode Two to Episode Four with no surprises and little character development, and depends upon what you already know about the entire Star Wars mythology to invest you in this movie and its characters rather than the action and dialogue of this one particular film. Also, there is little use made of either Natalie Portman's Padme Amidala - who actually has very little screen time - or the excellent Samuel L. Jackson, who is completely wasted given the small part that his character has in this film. Why employ such a great actor if you are going to give him lines that any extra could deliver? Additionally, for someone who has spent the last ten or fifteen years learning and living the ways of the Jedi, Hayden Christensen's Anakin Skywalker seems to have very little inner turmoil making a sudden and complete transformation from protector of innocents to the apprentice of evil. He irrationally uses his desire to ensure his wife's safety - when there is no perceivable threat to her health other than his own premonitions - as an excuse to savage anyone who might get in his way and even some who couldn't if they wanted to, such as the 'younglings' that he slaughters in the Jedi temple at Palpatine's behest. Thus the so-called transformation into Darth Vader is more like the flipping of a switch - more binary than analog.The best performance is that of Ian McDiarmid as Chancellor Palpatine/'The Emporer'. He has a serpentine smoothness about him as he subtly plants doubts in Skywalker's mind about who is really on the side of evil while deftly handling all of the warring factions of the Republic so that people will actually be grateful when he takes complete power.In summary, if you have seen all of the other Star Wars films you will probably enjoy this one because it fills in all of the gaps and answers all of the remaining questions. However, with some more effort in the direction and writing, those questions could have been answered with much better dialogue and characters that were more three-dimensional.",7,24,31,25 December 2014
Ray," Sometimes less is more...
","... and the crafters of this film got that. Ray Charles was a flawed human being. Actually the words 'flawed' and 'human' are redundant, so don't think I'm judging him. But his life was very complex. He had a drug problem. He had twelve children by ten women over a period of 35 years. He had repressed guilt over the accidental death of his baby brother. And he was one of the great musical geniuses of the 20th century. He started out crafting and performing great tunes in the early 50s before rock and roll arrived and managed to be relevant into the 1970s. When the likes of Bloodrock and DOA edged him out of the pop charts. No, seriously. But history has proven that his music has lasting appeal.So this film stars Jamie Fox in the title role and manages to blend all aspects of the artist's life into a cohesive whole - his impoverished childhood, his life as a musician and artist, his private life at home, and his private life on the road. And Ray's delusional belief that he can keep all these different parts of his life from having a head on collision. It runs back and forth between all of these phases of Ray Charles' life and kept me very engaged. And the music will give you a soul attack.Jamie Foxx disappears into the role of Charles and reflects the complexity of the man while still leaving him enough of an enigma to keep you intrigued. Kerry Washington plays Bea, the long suffering wife of Charles. When it comes to Charles' life on the road she doesn't know and she doesn't want to know. And yet she knows. Margie and Mary Ann are the two women who represent all of the other women in Charles' life. If you had the actual number of women involved with Charles in this bio pic, the traffic direction would become so complex that you wouldn't see the forest for the trees.Special kudos to Curtis Armstrong as Ahmet Ertegun, Atlantic record producer and friend of Ray. If not for this film I would only remember him from the 80s TV show Moonlighting where he was the (at least initially) unwilling object of oddball Agnes Depesto's affection.This film has great acting, obviously a great soundtrack, is a shining example of expert editing, and has a screenplay that I just don't get bored of even though the story of Ray is pretty well known. Great for repeat viewing. Highly recommended.",9,8,9,28 November 2019
Finding Dory," Another hit from Pixar that uses CGI to assist in telling a story...
","... rather than using a story to demonstrate dazzling CGI. This film was just as good as its predecessor, Finding Nemo. In this film (which takes place one year after 'Nemo'), Dory, who suffers from short term memory loss, makes it a mission to find her parents. She helped Marlon find Nemo in the first film and now she wants help locating her parents. She became separated from them when she was young and until now, has relied on others to help her find her way. She also gets by with her unique brand of impulsiveness and quick action. Throughout the film, Dory uses other 'people's' (fishes'?) words and objects to trigger memories that assist her in finding her way. It was very clever how Pixar incorporated these triggers to help move the story along and flesh out Dory's background. I also liked how they treated short term memory loss with sensitivity and did not make it a joke. The marine center that Dory & co. end up at is based on the excellent Monterrey Bay Aquarium. The funniest new character added to the Nemo franchise is Hank the octopus (except he only has seven legs as Dory points out and refers to him as a 'septapus.'). Hank is cynical, but you know he's a softy deep inside. He can also camouflage himself into his settings which is quite comical. There are other funny characters like Becky the buzzard and Gerald the seal with a uni-brow.It seems that Pixar thrives on adding emotional scenes to their films that pull at their audience's heartstrings. Finding Dory is no exception. There is a very dramatic scene near the end of the film where Dory is separated from her party and is lost in an unfamiliar, dark ocean, alone. She has to rely on herself to figure out how to find her way out and find her friends. This was a very heart wrenching scene. I won't lie, it made me tear up and I could hear other people sniffling in the theater. Another emotional scene is the beginning of the film showing a baby Dory with her parents. It's not as sad though as the beginning of Up, though.I'd recommend this one.",8,47,77,21 October 2016
Despicable Me," This is just a perfect animated film
","It has something for the whole family, and there is no wasted space in it. The story is pretty simple - There is a self named 'super villain' named Gru who wants to steal the moon, but his plan is being thwarted by another wannabe super villan - Vector. When Gru sees Vector's weakness for cookies, he figures his ticket into Vector's well armed castle to steal back a needed weapon are the three little orphan girls who sold him the cookies in the first place when they come back to deliver the cookies. So he has to adopt them in a hurry.You can pretty much tell how this is going to play out from the beginning. Gru is not THAT bad of a bad guy. In fact, well placed flashbacks show it was negligent parenting by his mom that likely made him want to do big showy things in the first place. How bad could he be if he is taking care of dismissive mom in her old age?So many of the characters are stereotypical - Vector the nerd villain, the evil morbidly obese banker, the older scientist working with Gru who gets confused about what kind of invention he is supposed to be building, and the three little girls who act delightfully on key for their ages.The fun is in all of the one liners, the character development, and the minions. Before Universal Lucasized them into the main point of the franchise, the minions were delightful if unintelligible comic relief. Highly recommended.",10,0,0,13 April 2019
Fifty Shades of Grey," It's smut! and dull smut at that!
","There is no real relationship, no depth of backstory on the characters. However, it is well photographed - in other words it doesn't look like the cheap porn movies they were making in 'Boogie Nights', which was a first class film about the porn industry. This is just a soft core porn biology lesson, plain and simple. Another movie in a similar vein was 'The Lover', which was was much better done than this. Sure, 'The Lover' had hot sex scenes, but it had character development and atmosphere too. This film would make sex seem boring to teenage boys. I didn't read the book, so I can't speak to how true it is to it, but if it did follow it closely, I can't imagine how the book could have been a success. Avoid and don't waste your time.",1,0,0,18 June 2016
The Greatest Showman," I just loved watching Hugh Jackman sing and dance
","I thought this was an incredible movie, so I was also curious about the overload of criticism. I understand viewers having frustrations about the 'historical accuracy' of the movie. I knew nothing about PT Barnum's life when I saw this, so I was able to enjoy it as an independent creative piece--which, to me, is what it was meant to be. In it of itself, the movie was altogether captivating from the filming aesthetic, to the music, to the creative dialogue, to the storyline. I finished the film feeling inspired and motivated. It hit the nail on the head, for me, to motivate adults and children's' imagination--reminding humanity of what's most important: love, hope, family, friends, spreading joy, fighting for what you believe in amidst criticism, etc. It shines a light on flawed societal standards of happiness (the American dream) by using unexpected people, methods, and situations to open others' minds, and break them away from fixed, mainstream thinking patterns of materialistic success. Its message sparks excitement and enthusiasm, especially towards those of us who feel inadequate, or 'in the shadows'. It's a motivating and inspiring breath of fresh air.I would hope that all movie makers' of this genre have the goal is to create a story/artwork that invigorates a similar kind of audience response to the one that I had to The Greatest Showman. If I were looking for a biographical movie, expecting a completely accurate historical recounting, I'd go see a documentary.",9,2,3,8 October 2018
A Night at the Roxbury," This is one of my guilty pleasures
","Yeah, it's one SNL skit stretched out to an hour and a half, but twenty years later it is still funny. It is dated. Lots of people will not know who Richard Grieco is or anything about 'Twenty One Jump Street', and why are those people talking into bricks? but the human element is still recognizable and therefore funny.You have two very childish geeky brothers close in age and aspirations - they want to own their own club - but they have a dad (Dan Hedaya) who is completely unhappy with them and their lack of interest in his business and what he hopes will be their business someday - an artificial flower shop in Beverly Hills.The Butabi brothers think that they are much cooler than they really are, would starve if not for dad's wealth, and go out every night in hope of getting into an exclusive club - the Roxbury. The bouncer is having none of it. Then one night they get rear ended by Richard Grieco, and to avoid a possible lawsuit he gets them into the Roxbury. The plot takes it from there.What are the human elements that are familiar? Two guys well into their twenties trying to hide their lack of sexual experience, and falling for two party girls who would not give them the time of day if not for who they think they are - rich guys with connections. A man with lots of wealth and business savvy actually liking these two guys who have nothing going for them that anybody else can see. A dad who is particularly angry with one son maybe because he reminds him of himself at that age. And a girl who chases after the other son because she knows she can manipulate him into marriage and unite two empires - her dad's lamp store and the Butabis' flower shop.I have no idea how one fake flower shop could make Mr. Butabi that rich, but it is still funny after all of these years. And the soundtrack is to die for. It's too bad Hollywood is so broken these days that they just can't make silly movies whose entire point is just plain fun.With Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan as the clueless and close-as-twins Butabi brothers, Dan Hedaya as the constantly yelling father, Loni Anderson as the unconditionally loving mom who has a permanent scaffold built around her for all of the plastic surgery she gets, and Molly Shannon as the aggressive and mercenary girl chasing after Ferrell's character, sometimes literally.",7,5,5,11 November 2018
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A break from the cynical films of the 1970s
","The latest TCM production entitled TCM Presents A Night at the Movies: George Lucas & The World of Fantasy Cinema, was really 2/3 about Lucas's films and it seemed that 2/3 of that was about Star Wars - but that was OK because it finally drove home to me what I have suspected for years - that George Lucas did not and does not have a clue as to what made Star Wars great. He got lucky with the first one (this film) because it was a product of its time and was what people WANTED to see in 1977 - something hopeful and fun. Remember - or maybe you are too young to remember - movies in the mid 70s were extremely cynical post Watergate and post Vietnam. This one was different and even religious in an ecumenical way. Lucas got lucky with the second one because of the director and his input. To me, all the ones that came after The Empire Strikes Back were special effects filled duds. Now back to the original.In that cynical era in which nothing was black and white and everything seemed at least gray and a little tainted came this little space western. The sound effects were hokie, the graphics were poorly rendered, and all of the creatures were real men and women in rubber suits not CGI. But that was not the point. The point was that HERE was a force of pure evil - The Empire - that everybody could be completely against. The heroes were imperfect yet you could rally around them. You have a young boy of about 19 who is treated well by his farming aunt and uncle but wants a bigger destiny, you have an old man living in the hills like a hermit that wants that young boy to join the fight against the empire, and not until The Empire touches the boy personally does he make a rather hasty decision to do so. There is a girl, a princess, who is not waiting for somebody to come rescue her and helpless. She's tough, she can handle a weapon, and she can handle the fourth in their little band, Han Solo, who sticks his neck out for nobody a la Casablanca's Rick Blaine and seems completely mercenary, yet he gets involved. If you like science fiction and good old fashioned adventure you'll like it. If you are young and feel that your destiny is slipping through your fingers and are itching to make a difference, or if you are older and want a chance to right a wrong that you feel at least partially responsible for you'll love it. And you CAN shoot first in the face of danger, have lived a pretty self involved life, change, and become the hero. As the 1977 original trailer said 'Star Wars - for the fun of it' and for the philosophy of it too.",9,4,6,11 July 2015
Deadpool," I generally hate super hero blockbuster films...
","... but this one is different. It's certainly not for the kiddies with its sex and violence. But here are not a bunch of 'all for one' people with super powers trying to save the world. You have one guy for whom things have gone terribly wrong - metastatic cancer in multiple organs. He's promised a cure, but is double-crossed by the guy who promises to save his life - he does . However his face and body are disfigured by scars by the treatment. The worse side - he is to be made a slave and enrich his healer. So after breaking free, 'Deadpool' is off to find the guy who did this to him and get him to undo it - he claimed he could. In the meantime he's not averse to killing everybody who worked for the guy if they can't answer the question of where he is.What's so marvelous about this film is that Deadpool is so human. What's fantastic about it is that he is a smart mouth extraordinaire. It's like House, M.D. meets Iron Man. He doesn't want to save the world, he wants to pound his tormentors into the pavement. And the film is constantly making fun of itself. When Deadpool meets the X-Men he mentions how they could have afforded more and better X-Men with a bigger budget - a little swipe at Fox studios which had no faith in this project that will probably net them a billion world wide.And finally, who would figure that a girl who takes her clothes off for a living would be Tess Trueheart? Highly recommended, but only if you have a tolerance for all of the stuff that comes with an R+ rating.",10,9,20,27 February 2016
Green Book," Not to say it isn't a decent movie...
","... just that it's so inoffensive, safe, and cliche that I feel like I've seen it a million times before. Mortensen and Ali are terrific actors, and I am thankful for them. Without their charisma (and Viggo's willingness to shove insane amounts of food down his throat), I fear Green Book would be dead on arrival.Mostly, I think this is a movie that's desperately afraid of 'offending' anyone. For instance: if there's a scene with racist cops, there will also be a scene with a good cop down the road, just to make clear that the movie is not stating or suggesting that 'all cops are/were racist'. It's also funny that the good-cop scene happens in the snow, to let us know the characters are back in a blue state, where supposedly life wasn't so bad for a black man after all! This is one of the many simplistic moves that indicate to me that the filmmakers were willing to sacrifice the complexities of their themes for a feel-good entertainment.The script wants both characters to 'learn' from each other and eventually change and grow, but to make this happen, it turns them into unrealistic caricatures. It's a bit frightening how Shirley is portrayed as a complete ignorant of black culture, but it had to be this way so Tony can be the one to 'introduce' him to it. Tony's transformation comes simply from witnessing racism first hand, as if he never experienced such a thing in his life before - maybe another consequence of this being a blue state-red state movie??So besides the performances, that speak for themselves, I think it's a very uninspired effort. At one point the characters leave the car for no reason other than to have a dramatic confrontation in the rain, as if rainy night equals 'dramatic weight'. I saw it in a packed movie theater and people seemed to enjoy it. You can't blame them. The movie has a 'now everything's fine' conclusion that can leave audiences in a good state of mind - but it also
shows how simplistic it really is.",7,281,414,23 February 2019
Back to the Future," Lots of fun, just don't think too hard
","Why will this film be remembered? Well, I'd say the strength and chemistry of the characters alone makes it an eight. This film was perfectly cast even down to the supporting characters. Then there is that marvelous score that reflects the atmosphere and energy of the entire film and is immediately recognizable. And although the overall ground of time travel has been trodden before, this one addresses time travel and its implications on so many levels. There is the main story arc, but then there are lots of little ripples going out to the universe as a result of the present interacting with the past that you may have to watch it several times to catch all of the changes and all of the jokes.Besides time travel, this one merges in questions about self-esteem and how it is built or destroyed, and how it changes things to EARN the girl instead of having her handed to you through a trick of fate and actually your own moral failings, along with some great action scenes and edge of your chair suspense. Also, it demonstrates what you've always suspected - that your parents were probably quite different as teenagers than they have told you. Heck, they probably even THINK they are telling you the truth! Still there is some stuff that just bugs me - just enough to knock one star off of the film from a perfect ten. Someone smart enough to build a time machine (Christopher Lloyd as the loopy Dr. Brown) does not know that Christ was not born on 12/25/0000? People being erased from existence in order of birth as a result of messing up the past? And why would George hang around in a town working at a job where Biff, the town bully, continues to dog him for thirty years past high school? Why not leave town, or at least spike Biff's drink with some untraceable poison at the company Christmas party that produces a death that looks like a heart attack while George laughs maniacally (in private of course)? But now we are talking a different genre of film aren't we? Plus, why are Marty's brother and sister exactly how you would expect them to turn out given Dad's lack of self esteem and mom's unhappiness with her situation, but Marty has turned out to be this normal kid, an apple falling far from the tree? And I really think that Chuck Berry wrote every song he wrote without any help from a time traveler. The only answer to all of these questions but the Christmas one is that these things have to happen or else the story cannot play out as cleverly as it does. I'll let you watch and see how it plays out.But first I have to set up the story for you. Michael J. Fox plays Marty, a normal kid who hails from a dysfunctional family of underachievers, and whose parents sole reason for being married seems to be that mom's father ran over dad with his car. Marty befriends Doc Brown, a guy who over the years has sold the entire family fortune he inherited in building his time machine. He finally accomplishes this, but to do so he needs plutonium, which he steals from some Libyans. Unfortunately the Libyans show up at the Twin Pines Mall where doc and Marty are about to give the time machine a test drive - it is in automobile form, a DeLorean to be specific. To get away from the terrorists, Marty has to use the time machine as a getaway car. In the process he crosses the speed threshold that sends the time machine into the date it was last programmed for, which happens to be the date his parents met back in 1955. Marty's only hope is to go find his friend Doc Brown, as a young man, in hopes Doc can help him, even as Doc lies dead in 1985, shot by the Libyans. Well, it gets complicated, but you'll enjoy every minute of this film that manages to be so 80's even when it is in the 50s.",9,0,0,5 August 2016
Goodfellas," The best mobster film ever made
","After you see this movie, all other mobster movies you see or ever have seen will seem like garbage. They and their cast of characters will all appear cartoonish in comparison. Of course, this is a movie about the mafia from the working man/gangster point of view, where 'The Godfather' was a mafia movie filmed from the viewpoint of the executive suite, so there really is no valid comparison there. 'Goodfellas' really does seem ahead of its time when you realize that the only artistic work about the mafia that compares to it in quality is the HBO series 'The Sopranos', which debuted nine years after this movie was made.'Goodfellas' tells the real-life story of mobster Henry Hill, and it is largely true, although there are individual scenes that are out of sequence and others that were added for dramatic effect, such as Karen Hill flushing the cocaine down the toilet during the drug bust. Also, Tommy, the character that Joe Pesci played and the part for which he won an Oscar, was actually a composite of two separate gangsters. Other details are omitted completely, probably because they would have spun the movie off in too many different directions. For example, crime boss 'Big Paulie' actually was having an affair with Henry Hill's wife, Karen. When Tommy tried to rape her and Paulie found out, that was when he alerted the Gambinos to the fact that Tommy had killed their missing crew member, 'made man' Billy Batts, nine years earlier. This is the true reason that it took so long for Tommy to be killed over that incident. Thus, masterful direction of the story by Martin Scorsese in what was probably his finest film is why the audience has a more cohesive view of the mobsters portrayed in this movie than if we had been told every last detail.What really makes this movie great is all of the personal details that enable you to see these mobsters living a largely suburban life, concerned about kids' birthday parties and getting the sauce just right for dinner, and all the while completely immersed in a completely amoral lifestyle in which murder and bribes solve everything- a lifestyle to which they would never voluntarily choose an alternative.",10,30,38,18 November 2009
Sully," Terrifically detailed work directed by a living legend, and starring one too!
","This is based on a true incident from a few years ago, where a veteran pilot actually was able to land his plane in the Hudson river in NYC and with all on board surviving. It is a terrifically detailed but slow moving work by 86 year old living legend Clint Eastwood starring the Jimmy Stewart/everyman of our era, in two time - should have been three time -Oscar winner Tom Hanks as the quietly unheroic hero pilot. (You were robbed of the statuette in 2000 for 'Cast Away', Tom. Who else could play opposite a volleyball for two hours and make it work?).I'm reminded of Eastwood's 2003 Academy Award winning 'Mystic River' in that he deliberately takes his time in adapting the book, as he does here as well. The script is a little odd, shifting back and forth between the events of the day itself and the hearing to decide whether the pilot and co-pilot were at fault for not heading to one of the nearby airports. This leads to a little awkwardness during the first third of the film, but then works out just fine. We see the big event twice - The epic landing of the jet is more than worth seeing in and of itself.Aaron Eckhart, for once, gets to play a good guy, the co-pilot. How nice to see Delphi Harrington, a much underused actress, as the passenger in the wheelchair. She was marvelous as an intelligent, sophisticated woman in the long-gone soap opera Where the Heart Is and was also believable as a trashy Southern murderess on Guiding Light and as a trashy Southern prostitute on All My Children. Here she plays a somewhat stereotypical New York Jewish mother. As a daughter she gets Valerie Mehaffey of Desperate Housewives.Sully shows something rarely seen in movies these days, the simple heroism of ordinary people, like the ferry boat crew members who rescue the passengers from the plane.Be sure to stay for the credits, where you will see a reunion of many of the actual passengers and crew from the flight. And as Columbo would say, just one more thing - The last line of the movie is a hoot and got a big laugh! Highly recommended.",9,64,83,19 September 2016
Jurassic Park," A milestone in its time
","The biggest attraction of this film back in 1993, of course, was the realistic computer graphic animation of the dinosaurs by SGI coupled with the realistic sound effects and the good use of suspense built around them both.After I first saw this movie in the theatre 24 years ago, I laid in bed awake for hours, not from fright, but from the lingering excitement of the entire experience. Up to that time, nothing like it had ever been done on that scale. This is hard to remember when, since then, the Discovery Channel came up with the whole 'Walking with ...' series of documentaries on dinosaurs, early man, and creatures before the dinosaur that use the same techniques that this film did, and thus people have become accustomed to this level of realism in animation both on the small and large screen.Thus with the 'shock value' of the animation removed, this movie doesn't seem quite as '5-star' as it did during its first run. The dialogue, in particular, seems a bit thin now. One aspect of the movie that still impresses me that doesn't get much mention is the outstanding use of sound and sound effects. For example, when the T-Rex first appears in the movie, it is not just the sight of the thing that terrifies, but its tremendous roar. It is still great action adventure viewing for the entire family.",8,6,9,27 March 2017
The Wizard of Oz," Perhaps the most well known and watched film in history?
","This film predates my birth by 19 years, so I've seen it as a child when it was an annual event on network TV, stretched out to hours in length, believably due to commercials and maybe not so believably today due to the network hosting and talking about the film a little during breaks.Today at age 55, when it shows up on Turner Classic Movies, even though I have in my possession the deluxe 'Wizard of Oz DVD Set and Museum in a Box', I'll still stop and watch it from whatever point I catch it to the end. Having the advantage of having seen it at all ages I can truly say that it has enough fantasy and whimsy and spectacle to keep the interest of children without being inane so that adults cannot appreciate it too. I think in all of filmdom only Walt Disney in Walt's time with his animated features and Pixar in modern times have been able to strike that balance. Even 'Star Wars' has lost a step or two in the 36 years since its release.Wizard of Oz has the universal themes of the value of friendship and family, of how many of us have strengths and virtues inside of us we'll never believe we have until tested, and how many powerful people are literally all hot air. 'Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain' is practically a slogan of American politics as I am writing this in the year 2013. Then there is beautiful Judy Garland when her exterior still matched her voice, before the studio system chewed her up and literally spit her out. She was never more lovely than she is right here. You'd never believe Billie Burke as the good witch Glenda is 55 years old. You'd never believe that Margaret Hamilton as The Bad Witch is only 37. I remember seeing her on a daytime commercial in the 1960's as a child and thinking 'Isn't she dead yet?' There is maybe one aspect of this film that is uniquely pre-WWII. The theme of the film - 'Never look for anything if you can't find it in your own backyard' is a motto for the isolationist years between the wars that would be left behind in only a couple of years when it became apparent that the U.S. would have to confront the evil expansionist powers growing on both sides of the globe. It is perhaps a unique snapshot in time in that regard only. It also shows the best the studio system could produce in that fabled year of 1939 when it was at the height of its power.Forgive me for yammering on about a film that has been reviewed hundreds of times, but this one will always have a special place in my heart and my memory.",10,3,4,4 May 2013
Evil Dead II," From somebody who knows nothing about the first film..
","...but has thoroughly enjoyed the second one since it came out in 1987. From reading other comments apparently history has been rewritten in relation to the first, but I can't speak to that. Let me just say that if you haven't seen the first one the second one fills in enough details that you know what is going on.The film starts with Ash and girlfriend Linda taking a romantic weekend trip to a cabin. It's a cabin that Ash knows about, but says he does not know the owners, thus he really doesn't know their whereabouts. He says they'll just claim to have gotten lost in the woods if they show up. The cabin is actually where Professor Knowby brought the recently discovered Book of the Dead. We know this because Ash finds the tape recorder and plays Knowby's entries. On the tape Knowby speaks aloud the words that are supposed to resurrect the evil dead - those evil spirits that inhabit the forest and world around us. Once brought to life they can apparently manipulate objects and possess people at will, in search of a way back into this world via possession and a way to harvest souls for hell. Those spoken words do their work, and the evil dead are brought back to this world. Well it is nighttime, and since that is when the evil dead are active they immediately begin to make Ash's life a living hell.Meanwhile, Knowby's daughter Annie is on her way to the cabin with more pages from the Book of the Dead where she thinks her parents are doing research. She has with her a research assistant, and two locals who show her a way around the destroyed bridge that leads over the canyon to the cabin - a bridge destroyed by the evil dead to trap Ash where he is.There is confusion at first as Ash fires a shotgun through a closed door when he hears the four trying to enter the cabin - considering what he's been through up to that point that's no wonder. Likewise, at first Annie looks at the blood and destruction of the cabin and thinks Ash killed her parents. However, it is soon obvious what the real enemy is here, one you cannot see or hear, one that can possess anything, anyone, or even just part of a person. It can make the dead appear as they did in life, it can make the living appear as demons. One particularly creative thing done here is that you see things occasionally from the evil spirits' viewpoint as they rush through the woods, making an awful roaring noise, headed towards the cabin. The action and the chaos just never lets up from the time the forces of evil first attack the cabin. It's hard to describe, and I know it sounds strange, but there is enough tongue in cheek humor merged with some really riveting horror, that you don't feel completely drained from the intensity of it all. For example, when you have both a possessed lamp and a possessed stuffed deer head laughing at you, things get both so horrible and funny that you feel you are watching a satire of a horror film. Only the very end confused me a bit, and maybe that is because I haven't seen the first film. I'd recommend it as horror well done in a different and creative style.",8,2,3,1 November 2015
V for Vendetta," Ahead of its time, but set in the wrong country IMHO
","The idea of a terrorist as a popular hero, the irony of John Hurt who played Winston in '1984' playing the dictator, and the further irony of Stephen Rea who played a terrorist in 'The Crying Game' playing the relentless cop who is now hunting a terrorist for the totalitarian regime were all braver ideas than I am accustomed to seeing coming out of Hollywood in the 21st century.The acting is commendable. It is good to see Natalie Portman given the chance to take on a more challenging role than she was given in her part in the Star Wars prequels where, along with the rest of the cast, she saw lots of action but had little opportunity to act. Plus, Hugo Weaving had a real challenge to project a personality behind the Halloween mask he wore throughout the film with mere body language and the inflection of his voice. I think it was a challenge that he met admirably.I guess the one thing that really bothered me was the basic premise of the film. Having just read 'While Europe Slept' I find it difficult to believe that the United States would end up self destructing by ever managing to be more politically correct than any country in Europe, including Great Britain. I also find it hard to believe that religious fundamentalism would ever take root in England, since its language and ways would seem foreign to almost the entire citizenry. After all, the entire continent of Europe has been in a post-Christian era for about the last one hundred years. Nobody in Europe would even understand what the dictator was talking about when he delivered one of his religious rants - he might as well be reciting Shakespeare backwards.Instead, this film looks more and more like a futuristic vision of the U.S., and not even that futuristic. I can easily see a theocratic fascist regime set up in the United States, citizens hassled endlessly by security forces over minor infractions of countless rules, and Americans just sitting back and taking it. Europeans would be more likely to protest under these circumstances than Americans, in particular if you could convince large numbers of them that it was 'God's will' or it was for the sake of 'national security'. Mix Calvinism with an extreme form of nationalism and you've got a recipe for exactly what happens in this film. In the U.S. we have plenty of both.",8,4,6,5 May 2013
The Godfather," An examination of the Mafia from the view of the executive suite
","The Godfather films (the first two at least) are operatic in their intent and are as sweeping in their view of the human condition as any American film ever made. They are not violent slice-of-life character-driven action films like Goodfellas or 'The Sopranos,' which are a superb film and an extremely watchable cable series, respectively. The Godfather is, to my mind, superior filmmaking because of its propulsive narrative and iconic characters.What makes 'The Godfather' great is that the characters in it know they are doing evil things, but rationalize it to themselves that 'the end justifies the means'. Coppola makes the hypocrisy and utterly failed values system pretty clear. A baptism inter-cut with scenes of murder...Vito Corleone is at his daughter's wedding, but sits there planning brutal mob stuff in his office...leave the gun take the cannoli...OK to cheat on your wife but 'dont discuss business at the table' and so on.I had to watch this movie several times before I completely 'got' it. The plot alone is very difficult to follow with all of the questions it raises. However it is one of those movies that rewards the viewers with those very questions for us to ponder and with its richness of story and character. The questions are about how people who regard themselves as 'good' can do terrible things and justify it to themselves. 'The Godfather' posits one of the universal problems in life - what is the nature of evil, and how can we recognize it in all its forms? How can people who do evil things think of themselves as basically 'good' , how can they lie to themselves as they do?Central to all of this is the metamorphosis of Michael Corleone. He starts out as the returned all American WWII soldier with the respectable but outsider (in reference to 'The Family') girlfriend, Kay, and by just doing what he thinks he must do to protect his family, one thing leads to another, and he ends up the cynical head of the Corleone crime family, morally miles from where he was when we first meet him.",10,1,1,25 February 2017
