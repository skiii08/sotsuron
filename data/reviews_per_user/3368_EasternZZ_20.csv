Requiem for a Dream," Plotless movie
","No plot in this movie, just a series of scenes showing people doing drugs. None of the characters have an Arc (beside Ellen). They start off doing drugs already, and just get deeper into doing drugs. There is no point where they decide to stop doing drugs, but then fall back into doing drugs. There is no narrative structure with this movie.The acting is great, and the music superb. I love hopeless movies, and this is a movie that starts in darkness and ends in the deepest parts of hell. That is life for you people. But as a movie, I wished it had more of a plot. As a study on drug abuse, it doesn't go deep. If you want to know what drugs do to someone body, I suggest you go and watch the movie call.....",6,1,3,3 October 2018
Inglourious Basterds," Needs more Brad Pitt
","Hello? Brad Pitt was so awesome in this movie, too bad he is only in the first 30 minutes and like the last 45 minutes. That is no problem for a normal movie but this is a 3 hour movie. We spent over an hour in the middle on this lady's revenge against those damn Nazis, and then about 20 minutes on a card game.Everytime Brad Pitt was on, it was awesome. He is the highlight of this movie. I just wished he was in at least 90% of the movie.7/10",7,0,4,3 October 2018
Terminator Salvation," Worst Terminator
","People give Genisys a bad rep, but Salvation is a lot worst. Terminator is Arnold's movie, and when you force a plot into a movie to try to continue the story, but you also try to bring the old stories and mix them with the new ones, you get a huge mess of a film. This movie wants to be a new movie from the original 2 movies, but they keeping bringing up dialogue of similar cool stuff from the originals into this movie.The action is just ok for the most part, but the highlight is the final 30 minutes where you get to see what happens inside a Terminator factory. Bale is doing his best, but he looks bored and probably only did this movie for the big bucks.The worst thing about this movie is the story. If you have great action, then a story wouldn't matter. Unfortunately the original Terminator films were usually very high on story and had deep themes about human survival, and yet still delivered on great action. This movie has none of that.Honestly, I think Genisys is a way better film because it doesn't try to continue the story of the Terminator films, it creates an alternate timeline and a great 'what if' scenario.4/10 (Only worth watching for the CGI Arnold cameo at the end of the movie)",4,4,6,19 October 2018
Suicide Squad," An Unwatchable movie
","This movie is unwatchable. The plot is completely senseless, the action is more boring than the 2005 Fantastic Four movie, misleading trailer, terrible final act (the entire movie is already bad), a waste of Will Smith (he is too good for this movie), non-stop usage of popular songs, and probably the worst version of the Joker ever seen.The story is about this lady who wants to create a special team to fight off bad guys, so she assembles some bad criminals and send them into this deserted city to fight a bunch of nameless creatures and save the city, while she secretly has something up her sleeves. The first thing wrong with this is that half of the 'Suicide Squad' are completely useless and shouldn't even have been a choice to fight this ancient evil. Harley Quinn, Boomerang, & Slipknot are completely useless and have no special abilities at all (Slipknot does nothing in this movie). Harley fights with a bat, and Boomerang throws boomerangs. They could have used special soldiers instead. Harley poses no threat at all, Boomerang is big but useless, and Slipknot may have a special ability but he does nothing at all because he is just in this movie to show the audience 'Hey, this is what happens when you don't obey orders.' Seriously, the actor playing Slipknot should be angry that he was dressed up, all hyped only to do absolutely nothing in this movie.The action is bad. There is not a single action scene that even gets you excited or whatever. Batman V Superman had way better action. In that movie we got some cool Batman car battle scenes, Batman and Superman fighting, Batman fighting thugs in a warehouse, and the final battle. The best action scene in this movie is the scene where the Suicide Squad is ambushed and Will Smith climbs on a car and shoots them. It is cool but still completely pales when compared to BvS. The final battle is also very bad, with the Suicide Squad suddenly out of nowhere telling each other that they are family and that they will defeat this evil, without ever giving us a sense that they even know each other. There is zero development in this movie. They spend a lot of time just walking down an empty street, talking without any context. For no reason at all, they go into a bar and start drinking, then Harley suddenly becomes sentimental and berates one of the Suicide Squad for doing something bad, while she and everyone else does bad stuff too. Lastly, nothing against Jared Leto. He has two songs I like. His performance in this movie is a complete fail. He is just channeling Health Ledger, even though he said he won't. He licks his lips when talking just like Ledger, he talks just like Ledger, and he make these head movements just like Ledger. He is a Mexican gangster in this movie, with gangster tattoos, and he has no point in this movie. He has one really cool scene with him and Harley Quinn bleaching their skins, but besides that, this is the worst Joker of all time. His scenes are just flashbacks that happens during certain points in the movie when Harley Quinn begins to think about him, that is all. David Ayer is a great director, but for some reason this movie just completely fails. This is one of those movies that I would put on my 'Unwatchable List.' So far the list contains such movies as Transformers 2,and Moebius (2013).",2,0,0,24 September 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," First hour is bad, last 90 minutes are good
","The first hour is very rushed and fast, you don't get to connect to anything and Carrie Fisher is forced into the early parts of the movie. Her dialogue doesn't even fit and she says stuff that is so random. Also they jump through planets and scene very fast during the first hour. You see an old face in the very beginning of the film, and they did a bad job of explaining how he is even still alive after all this time, and why there was not even a slight mention of him or hint of his return in the early parts. This just proves that they had no idea what to do and just pulled stuff from random places. The trilogy wasn't well planned, unlike the prequels where Lucas knew exactly how each character was going to end up at the end of EP3.The only reason I am giving this an 8/10 is that the last 90 minutes are pure action and nothing else, they stopped doing with the story and it was just explosions and sword fights from there. I am not a big Star Wars fans so all I wanted was to hear great music, see cool CGI, and see action. I got all three during the final 90 minutes.Overall the first hour is a 3/10, the second is an 9/10, and overall if you just want to see cool effects and action, this is an 8/10.",8,0,3,21 December 2019
American Beauty," Life changing movie
","This movie is deep. Amazing music, and it tells you about your life. THIS is how your life will end up being, you will live with regrets. You will wish that you would have done something different. You will wish that you could go back in time and change things. Maybe it is not too late to change things, but at the same time maybe your fate is already sealed and there is nothing left for you but death. You only gonna live once, so remember that good times don't last forever. High School life is just a part of your life, a small part. It will end and you will never see those jocks again. Those football players will end up working at the local mill making $10.00 an hour, and spend their time telling people about the glory days of high school.This movie is made for those people who survive high school, and is now living a successful life. 10/10",10,3,4,3 October 2018
The Exorcist," Should have won Best Picture
","The greatest movie of all time. Sure now people will say the effects might not be great (but they are still pretty good) and that the head spinning scenes are too fake, but look at this movie through the eyes of someone in the 70's. They have never seen anything like this before. This reminds me of the first time I saw T2, the special effects blew me away. This movie still holds up, and the funny thing is that it is not really a horror scary movie. I see this movie as a thriller, on the same vein as Silence of the Lambs. This is about a girl who starts acting weird, murders a man, a cop starts to investigate the crime, and it is up to a priest to prove that she didn't do it but some supernatural force made her do it.Whether you believe in God or not, this movie should be taken as a science fiction thriller. Priests are known for centuries to rape little boys, so you really have to stretch your mind to believe that the priests in this movie actually want to help the little girl. I guess since she is a girl they have no interest in her. If she was a boy, then this movie would truly be a scary movie. Priests man, I tell you what. I know there is no God, we all know this, and this movie never really preaches it to you. Even the priest says that there is no God, and that the power of science has pretty much destroy any evidence of demonic possession or existence of God.Great movie, no real cheap jump scares, great acting, bloody and violent, and has a great finale. Movie is rather slow but I was never bored. The first 5 minutes are actually the most disturbing. 10/10",10,1,1,20 September 2018
Avengers: Endgame," A little bit 'too much comedy' but has a great ending
","Movie has a little bit too much comedy. I wish it kept the dark and serious tone throughout the film. Anyways, don't go in expecting a lot of action though. Doesn't really have action until the final 45 minutes. Movie is a mix of Inception, Back to the Future, and Infinity War.It is a little bit too long though, and the first 40+ minutes were pretty slow.
8/10",8,1,3,28 April 2019
Toy Story 4," Deep characters and about 'letting go'
","Don't let it fool you, this is a deep movie. The characters are very tragic, and this is WOODY'S STORY. This is the end of Woody's story, and it is awesome.This movie is about discovering what your purpose in life is, sacrificing yourself for others, and realizing when it is time to let something go. Woody has spent his entire life bring love to kids but there comes a time where he needs to let go and make time for himself.This is not as good as Toy Story 3 or 2, but it is better than Toy Story 1 (which is still a great movie).This is a great series and they should not make another one.9/10",9,32,60,24 June 2019
The Lion King," Movie is only good because it is a shot for shot remake of an already good film
","This is Lion King with nice HD graphics. There is maybe one or two new scenes that help flesh out the story, but if you have seen Lion King, you have seen Lion King (2019).The music is still pretty epic, but there is a very weird out of place pop song towards the final 20 minutes that just did not mesh well. Another issue is that 'Can You Feel The Love Tonight' was performed in this movie during the daytime, so the lyrics made no sense at all. People already talked about the facial emotions of the animals and and angry lion, sad lion, or happy lion look the same. I would just prefer them to make it a little bit 'fantasy-like' and just have these lions emote better with eyes or mouths.This movie kinda ruins some of the classic scenes, like the final battle was cool and a lot longer, but Simba and Scar's final showdown was better in the original. The remake didn't have the awesome slow motion slap that the original had.Lastly they ruined the most classic scene in the Lion King, the 'cloud' scene. In the original you saw Mufasa's face in the cloud cleary, but in this remake all you see are clouds and lightning, with a very very brief glimpse of Mufasa. It kinda loss the emotional impact.Anyways it is a 6/10 because it is pretty much Lion King with god graphics.",6,1,1,28 July 2019
Hero," Not a typical martial arts movie
","This is a historical martial arts drama with a lot of talking. This movie has great use of color. The story is the main focus in this story, although there are a lot of cool fight scenes. Very philosophical movie with deep themes. Not a hollywood movie, but a movie for people who have brains.Don't expects explosions and stuff, although there are a few CGI effects in the movie. Beautiful movie, soundtrack, and story. The final 15 minutes are also amazing.",10,2,2,15 August 2018
1917," Needs more action though
","The acting is great, the music is superb, the gunshot will make you jump, and there are some really epic escape scenes in this film. This isn't a war film in terms of Saving Private Ryan, where there are huge armies battling it out with brains splattering everywhere and so on. This has none of that.This is a mix of Dunkirk (no character development or backstory), Ad Astra (With the slow moving scene and loud music, and The Revenant (people trying to survive against the elements).This is NOT an all out war film like Saving Private Ryan, this is a slow burn with about 2 - 3 really epic moments that will give you chills and make your blood run.Overall just because of the filming that was involve in making this, it is a 9/10",9,1,2,12 January 2020
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Not the worst video game movie, but a bad 'Resident Evil' movie
","The zombies in this movie look terrible. They have this ugly green snot all over their faces. It looks like boogers. In the games the zombies look like car crash victims, which blood and guts showing. This movies doesn't have any of that.The out of place martial arts scenes are what really kills this movie series for me. The games did it later on, but this movie was made when Resident Evil was still 'Resident Evil.' I hated and still hate the martial arts.Lastly Nemesis looks great (although he looks tiny and short compares to the giant monster in the game), but they really did him bad. He fights in a one on one match with Alice in the movie, which is just completely dumb. I understand blasting him with a rocket, but Alice engages in mortal combat with him, and kills him with kicks.2/10",2,0,6,14 April 2019
Sicario," Mix bag
","The first 30 minutes, and the final 30 minutes are great! The middle hour is rather boring, and it drags on and on. It is funny because Del Toro is mostly in the first 30 minutes and last 30 minutes. He is the highlight of this movie and has the best action scenes. Speaking of action, this movie barely has any action. There is an intense and cool little shootout on a Mexican bridge, and then there is a cool final 20 minutes that have a lot of action and thrills, but overall this movie is actionless. Even if it didn't have action, I would mind if the characters were interesting. Del Toro and Brolin are the two most interesting in this movie, but they decide to focus on Blunt, whose character is so annoying. All she says is 'What is this? What is happening? What the hell? What are we doing?' Her character is also poorly written because she is so scare and suspicious about what Del Toro and Brolin are doing in Mexico, but then she goes to a bar and hooks up with a dude without any suspicious thinking. She eventually gets attacked and almost raped by the man.Overall, the sounds of the guns are great, and the music is thrilling. I just wished this movie had more action and less of Blunt's character. The movie does end with a really cool quote that would fit perfectly in 'Game of Thrones,' or 'Lord of The Rings.'",6,0,1,20 September 2018
Hoosiers," Better if you live or is from a small town
","If you live in the countryside or a small town, it is 100% that you will have to watch this movie in school. I am not into basketball, I find it rather bland with no real coaching needing. Football is way better because after every play each team gets about 30 seconds to plan their next move, as well as anticipate their opponent's move. Basketball is just constant back and forth, no accidentally touching or else you get a free shot. NBA Jam is great though.Anyways, from a small town in USA, this was a must watch. Teachers forced us to watch this at least once a year.",8,2,3,15 November 2018
Joker," Slow build with a great payoff
","This is a slow movie, but there are violent scenes of action throughout to keep you interested. This movie is not 'that' violent, but it is the most violent movie based on a DC character. You see people get shot in the head with blood flying out, people getting their heads smashed in with brains showing, and well as people getting got multiple times in the chest.This movie has some good twist and turns I didn't see coming and it has a great final act.9/10",9,9,19,4 October 2019
Parasite," Just ok
","This movie is a vastly overrated film, but still had some cool moments. It just starts off very slow and the first hour is interesting but does drag on after a bit. The story is good, but it just goes on and on without any real purpose. It doesn't really go anywhere until the mid point, which has a really cool twist and you feel like the movie will bring up the topic of debt, but it just sort of stops. Then suddenly the final 20 minutes becomes Friday the 13th.The biggest issue is that you never feel for the main characters. They have no backstory. They are poor, and nothing else. They can't even fold pizza boxes yet still complain when the owner takes off 10% from them. They are kinda unlikable and are pretty much scammers. They cost people their jobs by lying and we are supposed to feel bad for them? They go into people's house and stay there while the people go on trips. You just don't feel for them, and at the end they try to have this big emotional revelation but it completely fails. Why would we feel bad for a bunch of poor scammer who end up being murderers?In the end it had some cool and intense scenes, a hot sex scene, some cool violent scenes, but it is not a masterpiece. The story really goes nowhere and in the end it just ends up exactly where it started. SNOWPIERCER is a masterpiece! Go watch that instead.7/10",7,37,87,3 November 2019
Black Panther," One of the weaker Marvel movies
","This movie is really not that great. I found it boring, action was mediocre, acting was good, similar story to many other movies (Lion King), and terrible CGi. Seriously, I don't know how a movie this expensive has such bad CGI? There is no weight or realism to the characters. They float like paper and when we have two CGI characters fighting, it looks about as good as a Playstation 3 cutscene. This movie doesn't really have a plot until the final act of this movie when Kilmonger comes into frame. It is cool that it shows us African culture, that was nice. Some of the comedy was funny, and I like the actress who plays his sister, She was good. Once again, all the actresses and actors were good in this. It is just that this movie was boring, bland, and very long.It doesn't add much to the Marvel cinema, and the action is really a huge letdown in this movie. The final battle makes no sense,like how a character just suddenly turns evil out of the blue. Michael Jordan is good in this movie, he has does say some of the deepest stuff in this movie. He talks about the enslavement of Blacks and how other Blacks just seem to forget to help their own people and become greedy. That was deep man, and he ends the movie with another quote that hits you hard, something like 'Bury me in the ocean, with my ancestors that jumped off the ships, because they knew death was better than bondage.' He doesn't get much screen time so that kinda sucks, and his fight scene at the end with Black Panther was really bad. It reminded me of Spiderman when CGI characters fall while fighting. It looks really bad. His fight scene with the human Black Panther on the water fall was cool though.6/10 This isn't the best Marvel movie like some people claim it is. THe best Marvel movie is still The Winter Soldier. The worst Marvel movies so far are Iron Man 2, Iron Man 3, & Dr.Strange.",6,0,2,3 October 2018
Da 5 Bloods," Uneven films, great moments mixed with a clustered story
","The acting is great in this movie, and there are some really moving scenes in this movie. You do get that nostalgic brother love between these guys, the plot starts off really good but it becomes way to clustered in the mid point.This film is just a little bit too long, and it is just a weird thing to have very serious drama mix with cheesy '70's type' action. The action scene in Vietnam looks like a B movie action from the 70's, something like Black Belt Jones.The last 40 minutes is kinda a drag, and it goes on way to long, with a final speech that is way too long.7/10",7,1,3,18 June 2020
Fantastic Four," Not the worst, but one of the worst superhero movies ever
","Nothing happens in this movie, that is the reason. There is no action scene until the final 2-3 minutes, which is a very small and short fight scene in the middle of a street. It ends in literally 2-3 minutes. There is a scene of them helping a bridge from collapsing, but there is nothing exciting about this at all. I don't know why this movie got made, it was really boring and one of the blandest comic book movie ever. It is call an 'Action Movie' but it should have just been call 'Bad comedy Drama' or something because there is no action.The only positives I can think of is that The Thing looks just like he does in the comic (but very rubbery and plastic), and Chris Evans realized that this movie isn't working out, so that is why he went and did Captain America. I guess this movie kinda show the world who Jessica Alba is but honestly, she is a terrible terrible actress. Everytime she talks in any movie, it is like she is talking to a child. She is not a good actress and the only good movie she has ever done in her career is 'Sin City,' and she was only in a little part of it. She got by just because of her looks, not because of any actual skills or talent.Besides that, this movie bored me to death. I saw it way back when I was 14-15 and I was bored back then.",2,2,7,15 November 2018
