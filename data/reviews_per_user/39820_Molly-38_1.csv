The Blair Witch Project," I think I could have made a scarier movie MYSELF!!!!!
","[Editor's note: this comment contains a minor SPOILER]Personally I felt like I was watching a really bad episode of MTV's the REAL WORLD! I was really excited about seeing the movie...and had heard excellent reviews. I really didn't find it scarey or intense. First of all..this supposed legend of the Blair witch was not properly explained AT ALL! What in the hell kind of Documentary were they DOING? about what? some children who got killed? or some guys who got their intestines ripped out? BY WHO? It just didn't make much sense to me. I guess I was expecting some really intense moments..but most of them were pretty lighthearted, reminded me more of videos I have taken myself while in college. WHAT EXACTLY DO PEOPLE FIND SO SCAREY AND INTENSE ABOUT THIS MOVIE??? Other than some moaning or footsteps heard while looking at a black movie screen..Nothing much happens, untill Their friend Josh disappears..However I found it really strange that the other two don't seem terribly worried about him..I mean it shows them later the next day..Reminiscing about their hobbies...and joking around..HMMMMMMMM if you thought witches were stalking you, and suddenly your friend just disappears in the middle of the night..WOULD YOU BE IN THE MOOD TO TALK ABOUT YOUR HOBBIES? I don't know..perhaps I'm too critical...I did think there were a few eerie moments toward the end...BUT I WANTED TO SEE MORE...I don't feel there was enough explanation...or Intensity in the movie..For what its worth..SAVE YOUR MONEY..and if you really want to see it..WAIT FOR VIDEO!",Null,1,1,3 August 1999
