Requiem for a Dream," There is NO Sugar Coating of the Portrayal of Addiction
","There is NO Sugar Coating of the Portrayal of Addiction in this movie, Witness the things people will do for their addiction, and the ultimate price they pay. This is a heart wrenching reality for some and this movie pulled me into that world. An entire range of unfortunate situations including an arm amputation caused by infection from IV heroin use and amphetamine induced psychosis arise as a result of substance use. Excellent portrayals by all!! This is an important movie. Watch it.",9,0,0,4 April 2020
Parasite," Brilliant Masterpiece
","I've had my eye on this movie for quite a while, because I have to talk myself into watching movies with subtitles. I'm am extremely grateful that I did. I now understand the multiple reasons this movie garnered it's acclaim. Name a genre and this movie covers it. If you haven't seen it, do it.",10,0,0,2 May 2020
Trainspotting," Tragic Lives
","If you really watch this movie, you'll realize that it does not glorify drug use or drug addiction. There are some matter of fact narratives, which you imagine someone in active addiction must truly think and feel. 'People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that *****, which is not to be ignored. But what they forget is the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not ******* stupid. At least, we're not that ******* stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring.' What is it like to have one worry so strong that it consumes every waking hour? 'Because no matter how much you stash or how much you steal, you'll never have enough. No matter how often you go out and rob and **** people over, you always need to get up and do it all over again.' These quotes by Renton give some perspective. Too live this way is tragic. Ewan MvGregor as Renton is excellent in this movie.",8,0,1,1 February 2020
Flight," Q A Functional Alcoholic
","I've seen this movie a couple of times. Each instance was at a completely different period of my life and I watched with a completely different mindset each time. The first time I saw it, I saw mostly only what was on the surface, the thrill of the plane crash. This time, the second time, I watched it with the point of view of someone who helps individuals with addictions. Captain Whitaker did his job every day. He was able to function every day.
He saved lives the day of the crash. No question about it. He saved lives even under the influence of cocaine and alcohol. No one questions anything until something happens. We would probably be surprised how many people function while impaired by substance use. This is an important movie. Watch it.",9,3,4,21 February 2020
