Vertigo," Lumbago
","Include me out of that large collection of people who think this film is any good at all. It's not the very worst I've ever seen, which is why I've given it an extra star. However, if you want to know what it's really like, go to the 'hated it' section of reviewers, and you'll get a fair run-down.I've actually seen it three or four times, each time wondering if I could discover what everyone (well, not everyone, but a lot of people) thinks is so marvellous. Each time I watch it (I've got stamina) I find less and less to admire about it. Yes, poor Kim Novak is a very poor actress, even if she looks sorta pretty in a fake kinda way. The plot is utterly ridiculous. I know all film plots are naturally goofy, but somehow they should try to make you suspend your disbelief. Psycho succeeds excellently. This one fails totally. Nothing makes any sense: it's all perfectly idiotic. It's also very, very slow. The only person in this film I felt any liking or sympathy for was Barbara Bel Geddes; and she was the only one whose acting was genuinely credible.I've checked the spoiler box, even though I've given nothing away. I don't really want to spoil things for anyone.However, much, much later I feel I just have to ask one question which has bewildered me from the beginning. How did Stewart get down from hanging off the gutter? He's wearing a corset, the next time we see him, which suggests that he must have fallen, and broken his back. ? The distance to the ground is nevertheless so enormous that it would be impossible for anyone to survive the impact on the road below. The other policeman obviously died instantly. So is the whole of the rest of this idiotic story purely imaginary?",2,15,30,6 September 2011
Spartacus," Luckily, Kirk kept Kubrick under control.
","Kubrick started his career as a fairly dim-witted student, but was nevertheless a moderately talented stills photographer. As a film director he was also exceptionally pig-headed and obsessive, who frequently drove those he worked with to the point of desperation. A light touch was something he did not have. Some people think all his films are different. In fact, they all exhibit very similar and highly annoying characteristics. They are badly paced, since he appears to have had a poor idea of cinematic timing: the inflexibility, and fixed nature, of his stills photography training constantly shows through. The shots are composed as if they were intended to be totally static. An example in this film is the interminable build-up to the final battle. Often there are passages of excruciating slowness.Secondly, in almost every picture there is at least one actor who is driven wildly over the top, usually from being forced to undergo a prolonged series of takes which render him near-demented. The prime example is G.C.Scott in 'Strangelove', but there are many others. Kubrick may not have been responsible for the casting of Tony Curtis, but the actor's performance here as a 'singer of songs' bordered on the ridiculous.Thirdly, although Kubrick relied on using scripts by gifted writers he seems to have constantly wanted to distort these scripts along his own lines. The 'adaptations' he made were not constructive, and never improved the stories. Authors he mistreated in this way included Burgess, Clarke, Nabokov, King, Schnitzler, etc. Typically, 'Burgess felt that Kubrick had used him as a film publicity pawn', according to Wikipedia. Burgess later called him 'Sidney Labrick'. Malcolm McDowell shared these feelings, and spoke harshly about Kubrick. As evidence, both novelist and actor cited Kubrick's uncontrolled ego, made manifest in the film credits: the only author credited is 'Kubrick'. The sole thing truly great about Kubrick was his gigantic ego. If he was dim-witted, why was he so successful and rich? Bloody-minded doggedness does it, is the answer. Brawn bludgeons, beats and baffles brains.Kubrick once remarked that 'Spartacus is the only film on which I did not have absolute control', and this must be why it still retains superior qualities, sadly lacking from his later painful disasters like Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, The Shining, Eyes Wide Shut and so on. Curtis is reported to have written that Kubrick's 'greatest effectiveness was his one-on-one relationship with actors.' The ambiguity of this comment may have been because Kubrick perhaps was still alive at the time Curtis published it. Several actors fell out permanently with Kubrick: Douglas, Brando, Scott, for starters. You might call these relationships one-on-one, if your tongue was in your cheek.In spite of Kubrick, Spartacus is a splendid, entertaining and fascinating film epic, featuring fine performances by several outstanding actors: Olivier, Laughton, Ustinov, Strode, Lom, besides Simmons and Douglas. At this stage in Kubrick's career, all these personalities outweighed him, and, although I'm not totally certain, I don't believe any of them ever worked with him again.. The script is intelligent, perceptive, and often quite witty, although it tips over into excessive sentimentality at the end. The final ropy shots of Douglas on the cross make me think that Kubrick was trying to sabotage the film. However, allowing for the different eras in which they were made, it is a fundamentally better film than Gladiator. Both of these are far inferior to Troy, however.",7,2,6,27 May 2012
The Big Lebowski," Dynamic
","Crisp, elegant, and tightly-plotted, with no loose ends. The titular protagonist of this thriller is a heavyweight business tycoon, a Korean veteran war-hero, disabled but not crippled, with a charming daughter and a devoted second wife, famous for his charitable enterprises. He has an alias, who might be known as the Sherlock Holmes of Los Angeles, an amateur gentleman sleuth with the professional well-honed acumen of someone with a naturally keen intellect. This is no dud, but a man of intrepid action, ably supported by the Alley Irregulars, a couple of great-hearted associates who help him solve the mysteries at the centre of the epic, and who bravely face up to a gang of demented blackmailers and foul extortionists. There are many twists and turns and surprises along the way. What was the significance of the phantom kidnapping? How did the Hollywood big-shot producer get involved? Why did the Police Chief put his hat on before throwing a right hook? Why was the central piece de resistance of the tastefully furnished, state-of-the-art apartment micturated upon? At the end, you know there was something down there. The acting throughout this gripping tale is stellar, the dialogue is courteous and refined, but unfailingly witty. There are a number of dream sequences, reminiscent of Salvador Dali, possibly owing something to Alfred Hitchcock in one of his more surreal moods. Two animals, a marmot and a Pomeranian, play significant roles as the enigma unravels. Several forensic crime investigators are called in. There is also a sagacious narrator, acting as a sort of Greek chorus, lucidly explaining the intricacies of the background to the interplay of the characters.Make sure you see this masterpiece before you die. It's right up there with Chainsaw-a-Go-Go, and Bimbo Cheerleaders from Outer Space.Nought out of four found this review useful? I love this movie, and have watched it countless times! Get a life.",10,0,4,13 August 2010
Citizen Kane," Just don't give me Vertigo
","Some thoughts on the recent vote by that collection of pretentious nobodies called Sight & Sound critics. They've replaced Kane with Vertigo. Insane. While there may perhaps be about 5 films that are 'better' than Citizen Kane, there must be at least 50 that are 'better' than Vertigo, that farrago of zilch. One fairly interesting suggestion has been made that Kane is about Truth, where Vertigo is about Fantasy. For me, Truth is a million more times more interesting and much stranger than Fiction. Kane is a great, great film: creative, courageous, original, deep and gripping, mentally stimulating, superbly shot, written, acted. It tells you things about the world and yourself. It is youthful, vigorous and vital. Vertigo meanders along like superannuated sludge, baffling from beginning to end, telling you nothing. Incipient mental decay. Stewart is not too bad an actor; Bel Geddes is very good; and Novak is abysmal. All the actors in Kane are beyond excellent. But Charlie Kane is hard to take: the Truth hurts. Vertigo is merely soporific: a puzzle not worth solving.Kane is about America, and the American Nightmare. Barbarity to Decadence, via Hypocrisy, without Civilization. Vertigo is about San Francisco, and the Flimsiness of Tinseltown. Sidling into Eventide. However, it is arguable that the theme of both films is an attempt to recover or re-discover the past. Blade Runner is more brilliant than either of them. The memories of the replicants are simply faked.Here are a dozen films no better than Citizen Kane, but far, far 'better' than Vertigo: Chinatown, The Seventh Seal, The Pianist, Un Flic, Breathless, Badlands, Once upon a Time in the West, in America, True Romance, The Hit, Hard Times, Sweet Smell of Success. I could easily think of forty more.",10,1,4,3 August 2012
Memento," Demento
","After watching this for about 2 or 3 hours, and not enjoying anything, I felt obliged to look at my watch. Yumping Yiminy ! Only 20 minutes had passed by ! At this rate it was going to feel like 24 hours before I got to the end. So I'll confess: I accelerated the action. I might have missed a few plot points, but it didn't seem to matter much.Hang on. I guess I've said those words already about another movie made about the same time as this one. Actually made only 2 years earlier. I gave that one 2 stars, but I'll give this one just 1 star. Although this one had better actors. But the story was even more confusing. They made a film, then chopped it up into little pieces, and re-arranged these bits in a haphazard way. So they lost me. It was silly. The idea of Polaroid photos and daft little notes was just stupid. I couldn't remember anything that had happened, didn't want to, and it almost made me demented. This kind of playing with time worked great in Pulp Fiction, but there it was gripping and generally masterfully handled. Here it was fatuous. Eight point six stars ! Number 34 ! Has everyone in the world gone insane ?",1,4,10,29 April 2013
Inglourious Basterds," Cut and Paste again. Patchwork.
","Many suspenseful moments, but that's about it. Maybe I've seen too many films, but I kept being reminded of others seen earlier. Several scenes were reminiscent of True Romance: Waltz struck me as very like Walken in that great and original movie. The interrogation scene was fresh as new paint in TR, but here in IB it was starting to feel stale, and it was repeated more than once. IB even has Brad Pitt in a rather minor role; and what about the shootout where everybody starts firing and almost everyone gets killed? The premise was reminiscent of The Dirty Dozen, another fictional story of German officers and women being locked in a large space and then burnt alive. This no doubt makes a number of those who remember the holocaust feel good, but others may just think it reduces those who enjoy it to the same level as the original Nazis.Like others have said in earlier reviews, this kind of fake history can be amusing while it lasts, up to a point, but in retrospect it's disturbing. Think of Where Eagles Dare, where hundreds of Germans get blown up, have their throats cut, shot down by the dozens. Great stuff. But do kids get to believe this dung is actually true? Scalping? Baseball bat battering? American performance in WWII Europe was in fact pretty second-rate. Ask the participants from any other nation. 70% of the US didn't want to know anything about it from the beginning, and America only came in after the Japanese attacked and Hitler, being barmy, declared war himself, forcing US participation.The story of IB is a mess and a muddle: did QT just say to himself, what shall I do now? Anything goes, more or less, provided the scene works on its own. These scenes don't have to join up too well. What about the two suicidal machine-gunners shooting down the cinema audience at the end? They didn't seem at all surprised the place was going up in flames and all the doors were locked. With the girl being killed in the projection room there was even an echo of Morituri. And what happened to her black friend? All a bit of a shambles, I fear.I gave this film five stars too many. Can't believe the overall rating of 8.3.",5,3,5,13 September 2011
Alien," Somewhat tedious, sad to say. Only 5 stars.
","Spaceship, crewed by a bunch of mainly chain-smoking second-echelon mediocrities, including a suspiciously eye-rolling automaton, veers off-course in order to visit a creepy planet, for reasons undeniably obscure. One of the crew picks up what could be described as an infection, which then proceeds to knock off all bar one of the rest of the crew, rather like the famous Agatha Christie story about the ten little green bottles, hanging on a wall. The last survivor is a very dishy lady, called Sigourney, who feistily fights the nasty alien, dressed in her scanties, and hugging her moggie, and finally sees him off.That's it, in effect, and although every effort is made to build up the tension, it just becomes less and less gripping as the film moves towards its predictably triumphant end. I found myself fast-forwarding. That lady is far too attractive to finish by biting the dust with the others. There is no real story, but there was some narrative potential which could have been developed and explored: like what is the true nature of this alien? What is the motivation, the back story, of these dysfunctional space bums? And so on.There is no doubt at all that Ridley Scott is an exceptionally masterly film-maker. His command of visuals, his ability to get the best out of his actors, and (usually) his sense of pacing, are second to none; but he does need a good basic story, and good writers. Sometimes, but not always, he supplies these necessities himself. Not here.It astounds me that this film currently sits at #42 on the top 250 list, whereas Blade Runner, one of moviedom's all-time greatest, does not appear until #123.",5,5,14,16 June 2012
Dark City," Black Hole
","After watching this for about 2 or 3 hours, and not understanding anything, I felt obliged to look at my watch. Yumping Yiminy ! Only 20 minutes had passed by ! At this rate it was going to feel like 24 hours before I got to the end. So I'll confess: I accelerated the action. I might have missed a few plot points, but it didn't seem to matter much. Many of the visuals were rather amazing, but they, too, grew repetitive, and I wasn't at all sure what they were meant to be telling me. Also, there were vast crowds of zombies from another world, like things from outer space, hanging around. I could tell they wanted something, but I wasn't sure what. Was it Get A Life ? Aw, yeah, they wanted our planet. I seem to remember that plot from another film, long ago. Was it called The Bodysnatchers from Another World? War of the Worlds? Mars Attacks? Seems to me this story has been done to death. Some SF is brilliant: Bladerunner, Back to the Future, Terminator etc. Other SF is schlock and dreck. This is the latter, but I feel sad to say so, since there was evidently a lot of effort put into it. But it was boring: I just didn't care what it was about.",2,2,10,29 April 2013
A Clockwork Orange," Kubrick Sucks
","His films have impact. So does a sledge-hammer. Many years ago they used to knock me out; nowadays they give me a serious headache. They are bad, bad, bad, poisonously negative and painfully unreal.Trawl the net for a few useful, truthful quotes: 'Are his films pleasant and enjoyable to watch ? No. Are they works of genius ? No.' Bang on. (I've rectified the last word from 'yes' to 'no'.) 'All his movies suffer from having horrible characters'. That's right on the button, and it applies to Clockwork Orange, just as much as to the rest of them. Or more so. Horrible, horrible characters. I can hardly think of a single person in any of his films who is at all attractive or worthwhile. They are almost always pathetic and/or despicable, empty and ugly inside. There must have been something wrong with Stanley: obsessive-compulsive, depressed and depressing. Someone to avoid.Burgess explained that 'clockwork orange' means a man ('orang') wound up and driven by clockwork. That was Kubrick's vision of existence and humanity. Man at the mercy of machines, and little more than a machine himself, an apparatchik in a bureaucracy, a cog in a system, manipulating other machines, by trickery or force. Clockwork Orange is also even more visually disgusting than some of the others. The overall design is hideously dated and thoroughly nauseating.Memorable, even if I'd prefer to obliterate the lot. One star. Nurofen, please. Can't decide who is worse: clumsy, clunky Kubrick or silly, phony Spielberg.",1,15,34,20 September 2011
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Worth 8.1 stars? Not on your Nelly.
","The rating here on IMDb was the reason I bought this DVD. What a mistake. I read the rave reviews, and didn't bother with the bottom end. They were the ones that got it right. Even three stars is probably at least one too many. First off: it seemed to take forever to get going. I kept thinking, when is the story going to start? Second: I couldn't separate the various gangs --- they all looked more or less the same, and spoke in the same incomprehensible patter, dull, witless and obscene. Three: the whole thing felt like a continuous rip-off of earlier films. Not homage, simple-minded rip-off. The ending was so strongly reminiscent of The Italian Job, I could hardly credit it. After reading the one-star reviews I now recognise the lifts from countless other gangster movies, all better than this one. One constant cliché in English crime movies is the lovable criminal Cockney, nearly always incompetent. Personally, I find Cockneys, real as well as cinematic, uniformly unlovable. The Long Good Friday I thought was a very bad film, and this reminded me of it. LSTSM also reminded me, sadly, of True Romance, which is a great, great film.I was glad to see that many of the negative reviews come from British reviewers: they are not fooled. The good reviews seem mostly to come from across the pond: I suppose they are thinking that this is so weird, confused and corny it must be good. It isn't. Don't bother. I really don't know why I've given it three *** out of ten.23 April 2011: Totally disgusted to see it's now rated at 8.2 stars. Nauseating.2 June 2012: Please remove the two stars too many. Technicolour yawn.",3,4,9,6 August 2010
The Green Mile," Punishing.
","Excellent movie for those who relish suffering; both when watching it and from feeling empathetic pain themselves. Very suitable for either sadists or masochists, and all people who feel a strong need to cry. Brought to you by the same team that created The Shawshank Redemption, of which it is the obverse. Something like the Passion of the Christ. Shawshank described how one man beat the U.S. system, all on his own, and escaped injustice to freedom. It was almost plausible, and positively upbeat. The Green Mile describes how the U.S. system crushes innocence and saintliness, as well as how (some of) the guilty are made to pay for their sins. To be perfectly honest, it is messy. It doesn't make you feel good, and it's a sort of a snuff movie, apparently designed to make you a little sick. If you're normal.It is also completely implausible, and contains any amount of utterly ridiculous miracle-working, some involving the healing of peculiarly repulsive ailments, as well as a gaggle of exceptionally talented circus mice. Presumably this is in homage to Steinbeck's 'Mice and Men'. The leading character, Hanks, is inexplicably condemned to immortality, although, at 108, and not looking much like his earlier self, the impression is that he's only got about another 5 years to go, at most. Perhaps because the subject-matter was so dippy and off-putting, I kept getting distracted. How did they manage to make an actor, who is in fact a mere 6 ft 5 inches tall, unconvincingly look as though he were eight foot? I spent a lot of time trying to figure out the photographic trickery, and noting how and when it didn't quite work, just like I did with Malkovich, in 'Of Mice and Men'. I also found myself frequently looking at the time, and wondering how much longer there was to go.There may be an anti-capital punishment message involved, but the only miracle in connection with this movie is how it gets to #71 in the top 250. Watch Top Hat, instead.",3,1,6,17 June 2012
Blade Runner," One Marvellous Movie
","Matchless. A magnificent meditation on the reality of death, and life's ultimate lack of meaning. One or two mentally challenged reviewers have complained that 'replicants' could easily have been created a different colour, say, green; or been given six arms. Why were they made exactly the same as human beings? Answer: because they are exactly the same as human beings. In fact, all human beings are replicants of oneself. They are what one sees with one's own eyes, in the mirror, and all around one. If you follow the film closely. I think it was Ogden Nash who wrote: 'My fellow man I do not care for/ I often ask me what he's there for/ The only answer I can find/ Is reproduction of his kind.' Had he lived a little later, he might have written 'replication of his kind'.One of the brighter dumb-dumbs points out, in a puzzled way, that there are no children in this vale of tears. Well, there wouldn't be, since replicants are made instead. As well as toys for scientific Sebastian to play with. There's something of him in all of them. What exactly is Tyrell playing at? God knows. Why, exactly, were the pyramids ever built? What was the point of burying everything of material value inside them? I'll tell you about my wrapped-up mummy, you trick-cycling apparatchik. Take a trip to see her for yourself.Another thing. Without memories we have no identity at all. We only exist because we have learned to walk and talk, and remember how to do it. Who could we possibly be without our collection of mental photographs? Search me. Another thought: could there be a collective subconscious, and was Jung possibly right? Are unicorns part of everyone's folk-memory? Everything about Blade Runner is fabulous. It soars where the clunky and only semi-literate Kubrick stumbles and fumbles. Even greater than Marienbad, which sadly shot itself in the corporation; or anything by Bergman. The performances are nonpareil. The girl playing Rachael (funny spelling) is perfection itself. But all the players are flawless, anyway. The vision is transcendental. I guess you could say I admire it.",10,3,6,17 December 2010
Braveheart," Historical ? Do you mean hysterical ?
","Unbelievable. I'm talking about the Oscars, and #85 in the top 250, and 8.4 stars. And the story and the make-up. I would like to like this movie. I like the triumph of the underdog against long odds, and mourn his ending: betrayed, hanged, drawn and quartered. I like the Victorian statues dotted all over Scotland, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Stirling and other places, and the plaque in Smithfield. I thought it was kind of funny when the boyfriend starting blathering on about his PhD in military strategy, thinking he'd be made a general, and got chucked off the battlements. I like McGoohan, and I used to like Mad Mel. I was even mildly entertained when watching it. But coming out of the cinema I felt seriously let down. Fantasy fare for ten year olds.I've read about Wallace, quite a bit in fact, and this was just barmy. Gladiator was hard enough to swallow (Maximus fights the Roman Emperor in the Colosseum?). Braveheart was simply impossible. The blue paint was ludicrous for a start. It went out of fashion circa 55 BC, twelve hundred years before, and was never Scottish warpaint. Some of the positive reviews here make me want to scream, laughing. Did I know that William Wallace was Robin Hood? No, I didn't, and nor does anyone else. Did I know that the next king of England had Oor Wullie for a dad? Give us a break, puh-lease.What a missed opportunity. There are just about enough solid and well-documented records about Wallace to tell a rousing good story, within the bounds of sanity and probability. This is not it. Scotland for Ever! You englischer Schweinhund!",4,5,15,19 September 2010
Atonement," To be at one with oneself
","A mainly glum, disturbing, and strangely creepy fiction of doomed romance. In one of the features on my disc, one of the participants describes the house, which is a character, as creepy. I haven't read the book, or any of McEwan's tales, but this depressing story could be his self-addressed excuse for telling porky pies, and makes him feel better. Many (most ? all ?) gloomy writers make use of other people's misfortunes, and their own, when creating their fantasies. Perhaps they sometimes even create these misfortunes themselves.The way the narrative is filmed continually reminds us that a lot of it, perhaps all of it, is not actually happening: this socially divisive love story is end-to-end imaginary. That must be why it rambles over the place. The narrative is intercut with puzzling flash-forwards, anticipating later events. Did Briony actually see two figures clutching at each other on the library ladder? Or did she just make it up in her embryonic little scribbler's head ? The bookish setting, suspended among stacks of literature, is appropriate. All art is unreal, if you will; but there are degrees of unreality. In this case the reality of English interwar types (Cambridge or Oggsford men) during the mid-1930s is quite distancing, even though I was sufficiently alive myself to recall the run up to WW2. This distance annoys and clouds. Still, the package is not uninteresting, very well-made, well-dressed, well-acted, and all that. Seemed like an excessive amount of time at Dunkirk. Was Dunkirk really like that ? I can't quite believe it. There really are rather too many plot holes, and I had one question. Why didn't the young redhead, Lola, come clean ? However, this has been more or less answered on this site. She was out to snare a chocolate millionaire, no matter how creepy. I was going to give this eight, but now it's seven.",7,1,3,17 February 2013
