Hereditary," Boring too long Dont waste time
",Movie trailer looked awesome till i WATCHED THE MOVIE. I was so bored and if it was in a cinema would have walked out. Movie was way too long with too many boring scenes. Lost attention very quick. Scenes that was good was worth it but I didnt enjoy it at all. Been waiting for the big horror and the Big Bang but it just never came... Dont waste your 2 hours watching this. Not worth it. Whoever made and directed this please make something better than this,3,1,2,23 December 2018
