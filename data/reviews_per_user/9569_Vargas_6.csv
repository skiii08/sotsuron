Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," In a Parallel Universe, Far Far Away
","With 'Episode I - The Phantom Menace,' George Lucas has created a masterpiece of end-of-the-century, Post-Modernist satire.'Episode I - The Phantom Menace' is Lucas's brilliantly subversive, daring presentation of the first 'Star Wars,' as if it had been made in an alternate universe where his career was prematurely destroyed by a movie utterly lacking in wit, charm, excitement, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher.'Episode I - The Phantom Menace' is the picture that wary studio executives suspected that Lucas would make: a weirdly bombastic, hopelessly lifeless mess that would die at the box-office.The fact that 'Episode I - The Phantom Menace' is not a b.o catastrophe is George Lucas's exquisitely Kubrickian point. He's chuckling quietly over the irony that a film that would have failed twenty-two years ago will be a huge money maker. 'The Phantom Menace' could not fail because it's linked to the 'Star Wars' Lucas actually did release in 1977, not to mention the phenomenal success of the sequels, and the ancillary products.It's obvious that Lucas is commenting on the present-day reality of big budget, mainstream fantasy moviemaking. There's no place anymore for surprises like '2001,' 'Alien,' or the Terminator pictures. Style and content means nothing. The only things that count are the franchise, the logo and the slickness of the C.G.I.s.Bravo to George Lucas for deliberately making an almost unwatchably mechanical film that cleverly lures his audience into seeing themselves, like Dorothy and her Pals when they reach Oz, for the manipulated suckers that they are.",Null,0,0,4 July 1999
The Beach," The Overrated Mr. Boyle
","Danny Boyle's idea of movie style is shooting frenzied, bug-eyed closeups through a fish-eye lens. In lieu of genuinely powerful images, insight into character, compelling drama or even effective suspense, he offers rants and raves that in Trainspotting and Shallow Grave were an amusing novelty.  Of course, those pictures are now as dated as the corniest sixties psychedelia.
As for The Beach, it's a watchable, mildly entertaining movie that stumbles and bumbles in its attempts to go where the material is pointing. The references to Apocalypse Now are a sad reminder of the difference between an ambitious mediocrity and a director who knows how to make the screen throb with life.",Null,0,0,12 February 2000
American Beauty," It Is an American Beauty
","I just saw 'American Beauty' for the second time, and although I was more aware of the picture's mechanics, it moved as much as it did two weeks ago at the Toronto Film Festival.Backlashers will gripe that the film goes mushy, that Sam Mendes and Alan Ball are not Todd Solondz, that they are smoothies with too many tricks up their sleeves, blah and blah-blah.But the fact is that 'American Beauty' is a richly textured, emotionally generous, continually surprising movie with moments of poetic subtlety. And could the public's strong response    be a sign that it is finally smarting up?",Null,0,0,22 September 1999
Velvet Goldmine," Ambitious but...
","Todd Haynes is a freewheeling and daring filmmaker with a uniquely ambiguous take on his subject matter.  Was Juliane Moore in 'Safe' better or worse off after she escaped to her desert retreat?  Is the glam rock Haynes portrays in 'Velvet Goldmine' an empty vocabulary of vacuous poses, or a dazzling aesthetic of operatic proportions?  'Goldmine' is thematically and creatively an intricate, ambitious movie.  The problem is that no matter how effective Ewan McGregor and Jonathan Rice-Meyers are as the Iggy Stooge and David Bowie-like characters, they come across as blurred xeroxes of the originals.",7,0,0,9 January 1999
Mulholland Drive," This Is the One
","(I'm re-sending this because the first time, my computer crashed.)Rapturously beautiful, hilariously funny, thematically multi-layered (among other things, it's about Hollywood: once upon a time & right now, for better & for worse, ridiculous & sublime), Mulholland Drive is like the eponymous road it begins and ends on. It lifts you, drops you, blesses you with its vistas & fills you with apprehension. Despite the many things that could be said about David Lynch's excursion into a new region of Dreamland, one I hope to re-visit often, you keep hearing the tired kvetch: 'It was terrific, but the last 20 minutes were too weird.' Even if that were true, and I don't think it is, what a pathetic response to one of the few early 21st century movies that loves and respects its audience, assuming it wants to be astonished and provoked, rather that jerked off by cheap thrills and re-assured by boring platitudes.",10,1,1,2 October 2001
Big Fish," It Leaps, Glistens, and Snaps
","Some critics complain that the movie lacks Tim Burton's customary darkness while others kvetch it's so twisted, it undermines its own  aspirations to the light. Mixed Reviews, shmixed reviews. Big Fish is so blatantly hyperbolic in its optimism, it has a sinister undercurrent, even as it sparkles before eyes fatigued by bloated studio monstrosities and too much arthouse pretension.One esteemed writer for a powerful daily is unhappy that Albert Finney's/Ewan McGregor's compulsive storyteller may not really be such a nice man. Hello! Obviously, we're not sure about him, even as we're falling in love with the guy. The character is a descendant of Mark Twain's go-getting charmer in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court; he's too ruthlessly determined to be entirely trustworthy. And yet, like America itself, he knocks your socks off with his driving energy and star-spangled grin.It goes without saying that Big Fish is beautifully designed and shot, and Burton, generous in a way that he's never been before, regales viewers with images they've never quite seen. On top of that, the picture is the best re-invention of the American Tall Tale (one of the wellsprings of American storytelling) since Pulp Fiction.",Null,0,0,10 December 2003
