The Blair Witch Project," That was 90 minutes of my life that I'll never get back.
","Yuck! Oh, I heard a branch crack, what was that!  What was that!Sheesh, I almost laughed at the thought that someone considered this scary.",1,1,3,5 August 1999
Pearl Harbor," Too many details overlooked
","A contrived love story unfortunately interrupted by a sneak attack.Why can't Hollywood figure out that a story like Pearl Harbor, or Enemy at the Gate is so perfect that it does not have to be dumbed down with a silly love story?After watching the movie I had three questions:1)  Why were there DC-3s equipped with floater bars.  For those that are not aware, floater bars are used for skydivers so they can hang more people outside the airplane before launching a formation.  Take a close look and you'll see them.2)  Why did do many planes in a single formation have the same tail number? Looked like one plane copied over and over again.3)  I thought Alec Baldwin was leaving the country if George Bush was elected.  Why hasn't he left yet?",1,1,1,31 May 2001
