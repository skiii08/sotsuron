Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," abraham lincoln, awesome vampire hunter
","This review contains no spoilers :)i fricking loved this film from start to finish. the key is obviously not taking it too seriously. the action is reminiscent of the matrix imo completely fantasy-orientated, with a serious sub-message about slavery. I can't understand for the life of me why the overall rating is only a 6. To me, this is the best film i have seen for a while. It has a kind of feel good factor that reminded me of kick-ass. Of course it isn't supposed to be a realistic film, it's about abraham lincoln as a vampire hunter for Christ's sake! this film, for me, blew me away from start to finish. it is a fun film, end of story. it's not a historical, periodic drama, it is intended to be a fast paced, action orientated eye candy movie.i loved it. my only gripe is that i thought it could've been a bit longer. i also would love to see a sequel, even though this film basically wrapped things up in that sense.",10,2,5,20 January 2013
Life of Pi," a fantastical look at reality...?
","This is my first ever review.I didn't go into the cinema expecting a great deal from this film as it was actually the girlfriend who wanted to see it. The trailers looked all nice and that but it didn't give a whole lot of details as to what I was going to be watching. But I actually enjoyed it a great deal! It didn't start too exciting, just a writer looking for a new story having been told that this older Pi had one to tell. So it starts as reminiscing of his childhood, learning of different religions and generally experiencing life etc... at this point I was thinking she'd pulled a fast one telling me I'd love the film, it looks great...But it did get better. I won't go into too much detail as I can't stand people who, accidentally or not, summarise a film to somebody who hasn't seen it. I feel, personally, this film is about imagery, though some might say it's about metaphor. Maybe in the book you're supposed to read in-between the lines, (which I haven't read, BTW) but I feel the film is simpler than that, and just wants to show you the fantasy in reality. The entire film is a work of beauty. Even the simplest of things is captured in a way to stun the audience. Be it a night sea lit up by thousands of jellyfish, or a simple, yet frightening storm throwing pi and Richard Parker - the Bengal tiger - from bow to stern was cinematic-ally, a truly breath-taking experience.I think this film is a breathe of fresh air in cinema as of late, you can leave feeling that you've seen something relatively different for a change. Not just a remake/reboot of something milked to the teeth (though I don't have a problem with those kinds of film, it's just nice seeing something new).I saw this film a few days after seeing the hobbit, and can honestly say I've thought about this film more in the days after. I'll leave that to you to ponder what that means regarding the impact of the 2 films.",8,1,4,23 December 2012
