Requiem for a Dream," problems with the medical aspects
","First, let me say that this is an outstanding film and I have nothing but awesome to say about the actors performances...Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leno in particular being incredible.I have a slight issue with the story.  Being a doctor, I found it too much to accept the ending of this story.  Also, I am hard pressed to believe that any licensed M.D. or D.O. would continue to prescribe amphetimines to a lady in this state (or even that they would contemplate starting one).I have to mention that electroconvulsant therapy ('shock therapy') is painless when administered these days, it is given under sedation and has shown to be beneficial in cases of refractory depression (in treating amphetamine addiction, I do not know of any trials or studies).  Ellen would feel no pain.Secondly, Mr. Leto's arm would not be amputated for this infection, and even if it was, it would not be done with a circular saw.  I am an orthopedic surgery resident, we do amputations all the time, but not in this cavalier method without regard to the major blood vessels and nerves.Understandably, the movie is a bit more dramatic than reality would be.

Requiem for a Dream," stop your bitchin' and watch this flick
","Granted, many have compared this to other previous and subsequent drug movies...doesn't detract from the fact that many are worth watching for their character PERFORMANCES and communication of the hell which is addiction...To name: Spun, Drugstore Cowboy, The Basketball Diaries, The Salton Sea...ALL worth watching.  Drugs are too important a subject not to give due time. Regarding this flick...excellent feeling of Coney Island in its post heyday miasma (I am a native NY'er.. I should know the score by now), excellent perfs by Leto, Connelly, Burstyn, Wayons... Burstyn is NOT too simplistic as a previous reviewer suggests...believe me I know women like this of her age in the city. In short, Spot on.",Null,0,1,29 October 2003
