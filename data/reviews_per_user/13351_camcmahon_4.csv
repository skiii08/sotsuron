Catch Me If You Can," I haven't read the book just yet - I definitely will now!
","This was an entertaining and fun piece of film making from the ever-reliable Steven Spielberg. It is a bit of a depart from his usual full-blown and hugely epic pictures, yet this does not detract at all from the fascinating story of Frank Abagnale Jr. I was interested in this man before I'd seen the movie, and it only served to increase my interest. Although it is important to remember (as with any such film) that this is only 'inspired' by a true story and not told word for word from one, the plot is fascinating and keeps you laughing, crying and wondering until the end.Frank Abagnale Jr. is an astounding and interesting character. The real life Abagnale originally said that he did not believe Dicaprio to be 'suave' enough to play the role, but he certainly does pull it off. Dicaprio's acting is superb, and totally believable as a man who could lie to, deceive, and con everyone he met without once losing any of his charisma or charm. Hanks is also excellent, he plays the role of the obsessed FBI agent well, and also with a likable quality. The interaction between these two characters was great, it was interesting to see a budding relationship slowly build between two characters who were actually positioned against one another.I loved the look of the film. It was a refreshing blast to see the 60s portrayed in such a vivid and colorful way. The whole setting and atmosphere of the film gave it a wonderful and almost (I hesitate to use the word) 'magical' sense. This tone appealed to me much more than a darker tone might have.However, the film is rife with moral ambiguity. As much fun as it is to watch Dicaprio jumping from one place (and identity) to the next, forging checks and spending inordinate amounts of money at a whim, the film never really focuses on the morally bankrupt side of the story. The portion of the film devoted to this at the end still seems to skim over the fact that this man has stolen millions of dollars. It ends on a high note for Frank Abagnale Jr., never fully spelling out the wrongs he committed. Still, this would probably bring the whole film down, and sometimes it's fun just to enjoy a bit of escapism without being told off for desiring such things. I mean, it's hard to be totally strict and upright - you have to love it when Dicaprio's character swindles Jennifer Garner's prostitute for $400! Overall, this is a fun film and really enjoyable. Not as much of an epic masterpiece as some of Spielberg's other movies, but still a great film!",8,133,153,31 March 2005
Oldboy," An interesting and enjoyable film.
","When i had first finished with this film i wasn't sure what i felt about it. It was definitely not what I had expected, and i thought many parts of the film where either unbelievable or far-fetched. However, in retrospect I think that it was an enjoyable experience, and I think it is unfair to criticise it so harshly. I thought Min-sik Choi was excellent, finding him genuinely funny at times as well as disturbing in others, and nobody can seriously doubt his talent after seeing the excellent hallway fight scene. Although there were elements of the film I was unsure about it did keep me entertained, but don't expect too much from it!",7,8,81,2 March 2005
Mulholland Drive," A difficult film, yet still highly intriguing and enjoyable.
","I knew this was going to be a difficult film when i opened the DVD case to find a list of hints to aid me in 'unlocking' the secrets of the movie. Although I did feel that I enjoyed it, by the end i was beginning to wonder exactly why, and I was frustrated that many of my questions had been left unanswered. Having watched it a second time I have come to feel that this is actually one of the elements I like about the film, and it makes me respect David Lynch even more as a director. Instead of having everything spelt out for you the movie leaves you to figure things out yourself. The distorted plot, strange characters and settings will stick in your mind for days as you try to determine exactly what was going on. The music in the film was great too, with an eerie tune underlying many scenes that filled them with atmosphere and a strange tension, and makes some scenes really creepy. I found myself gripped to the movie at several moments, wondering what was going to be thrown at me next. I thought Naomi Watts was excellent, in my mind this is one of her best performances (and let's be honest, you can't totally knock a film that contains sex scenes between Naomi Watts and Laura Harring). Overall I think this is an interesting movie and extremely thought-provoking, although it's definitely not one to watch if your looking for a straightforward and easy film.",8,1,3,2 March 2005
Evil Dead II," An absolutely excellent follow-up to Evil Dead!
","I have to say that this is definitely one of my favourite films of all time. Bruce Campbell gives one of the finest and funniest performances i've seen. The film's constant movement from one horrific happening to the next leaves you wondering how Campbell's Ash retains any threads of his sanity. Even when it's just him in the cabin dealing with a variety of gruelling experiences Campbell gives every scene his all, filling them with a strange mix of disgust and humour. The scene where Ash has the entire room laughing at him (including the furniture!) has to be one of my favourite bits, it's almost as if Campbell himself has finally lost it. Raimi's direction is superb, I love the rushing camera movements and angles. This is a great film which relentlessly throws comedy, horror and gore at you (and Campbell) in vast quantities. If you're looking for something which will entertain you, scare you, and gross you out at the same time then this is definitely the film for you.",9,1,1,7 March 2005
