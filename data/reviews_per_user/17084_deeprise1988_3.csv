Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Better than third one.
",Fourth installment in the franchisee but it has nothing to do with previous movies. Captain Jack Sparrow is abandoned in the ship led by cruel Blackbeard with his daughter Angelica. There is prediction that Blackbeard will die soon so her daughter is seeking for the fountain of youth to give life to her father. And she has kidnapped Jack her former lover to explore the adventure. There are two more parties looking for fountain of youth. Movie doesn't offer you much until mermaids arrival. Film is enjoyable thats I would say. And better than third movie. Movie has nothing to offer new in the franchise but it surely entertains you. Jack is worthy.,7,0,1,18 June 2011
