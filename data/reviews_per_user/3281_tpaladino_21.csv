Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Horrible, horrible film.
","Let me start by saying that I actually like Sacha Baron Cohen and his characters, including Borat. I think that he is a true talent, and that his technique and timing are impeccable.This film, to me, was a real disappointment. You see, the charm of the television show was that it lambastes a wide cross-section of people, and the audience is pretty much in on the joke. The movie lacked both of these elements. It focused almost exclusively on unsophisticated middle-Americans, who are almost too easy a target for parody, to the point that his pranks lack any kind of diversity or inventiveness and almost begin to seem cruel in many cases. To me, Cohen is at his best when he takes on the cultural elites and those who take themselves far too seriously (feminists, academics, politicians, vegans etc.), not just poor, often well-meaning shlubs who were unlucky enough to encounter Borat and his cameras.The other major flaw was the fact that Cohen insisted on carrying a bizarre and stinted narrative throughout the movie. Everyone who goes to see this film knows that Borat isn't a real person sent to interview Americans on behalf of Kazakhstan, so the subplot of his slimy producer and their relationship just seems forced and out of place. The worst scenes of the movie are the ones of Borat and the producer arguing. It makes a film that is already struggling that much more difficult to enjoy.There are surely some laughs to be had, but you are better off buying DVDs of 'The Ali G Show' to see Cohen at his best, rather than wasting time on Borat.",1,6,11,8 November 2007
Sucker Punch," Nowhere NEAR as bad as reviews claimed.
","I avoided this film like the plague when it was in theaters, having heard nothing but the worst reviews imaginable. Hardly anyone had anything nice to say about it, and usually that is a pretty good indicator a film is bad. I mean, one or two bad reviews can usually be brushed off. Even a 50/50 split amongst critics can sometimes indicate a good, but misunderstood film. But when a movie is universally panned, it's a safe bet that you're not missing anything by skipping it. Wow, were they wrong here. I decided to catch Sucker Punch on HBO now that it's available, and I'm very glad I did. It's definitely not a perfect movie, but it's also nowhere near as bad as we've all been led to believe. It's got a few moments that don't really work, and I could have done entirely without the narration at the end, but other than that, it's a terrific, beautifully stylized action fantasy, filled with imaginative villains, lush graphics, pretty girls and a uniquely offbeat storyline. I simply don't understand where all the hate came from here. Yeah, it generally portrays a male adolescent fantasy of hot girls in skimpy outfits. Big freaking deal. There are far more exploitative films out there, few of which inspired the level of vitriol hurled at Sucker Punch. It's a cool fantasy film, with heavy elements of B-movie and classic pulp noir skillfully added for good measure. How this film can be hated but something like Grindhouse critically beloved is beyond my comprehension. Yes, Grindhouse is better. But not so much better to justify the massive disparity (83% to 23% on Rotten Tomatoes).And I'm not even a big Zach Snyder fan to begin with. I thought Watchmen was awful, and didn't think very much of 300 either. But I have to give him credit on this one; he was truly robbed this time around.",7,4,7,24 April 2012
Shutter Island," What a really good movie!
","I had heard that this movie was a disappointment... I even had the ending ruined for me about a month before it came out. Both of those things kept me from seeing it until I could catch it on PPV.I have to say that not only was this film not a disappointment in any way, but the fact that I 'knew' what the ending was didn't detract from the experience at all. Scorcese was really masterful at weaving a story that is absolutely engrossing and thrilling without resorting to creepy effects or obvious scare tactics (which would have been the cheap and easy way to tell this story). It was wonderful and refreshing, to say the least, to watch a genuinely interesting thriller that takes place at a secluded mental institution and not have to endure shock scenes of ghoulish creatures or other overused devices like that. I've read some of the bad reviews and critiques, and I honestly have to say that I don't understand what they're on about at all. Its a great movie.",9,2,5,26 March 2010
Watchmen," Has everyone taken crazy pills?
","I wanted to like this movie. I really, really did. I haven't yet gotten around to reading the books (although I still plan to), but after everything I've heard about the depth and weight of the source material, I figured that the movie would carry at least some of those elements over successfully. It so didn't.What the movie became is a nearly incomprehensible three-hour mishmash of sub par acting, confusing flashbacks, corny dialog, and pseudo-intellectual claptrap. The characters, while very compelling on the surface, are developed so poorly that you never really care about any of them. You don't feel anything for the obvious tension and conflict that the director is trying to create. They're all just gloomy people in costumes.And this is all particularly sad because at the same time, especially at the end, you get the feeling that there really was a great story in there that was trying to be told. Some very strong philosophical ideas appear, and you sort of realize that during the whole movie you just stammered through, maybe something of substance could have existed, but was completely squandered. The film does come together in the last 20 minutes or so, but by then its much, much too late.",5,4,9,8 March 2009
American Psycho," Good Film, Phenomenal Book
","First, I have to say that I really did enjoy the film very much. I also read the book AFTER seeing the film, which I think gives me a unique perspective as opposed to those who read the book, then saw the film as a disappointment.With that having been said, I was amazed with the excruciating detail that the novel's Patrick Bateman went into when describing his life and routine. Bret Easton Ellis is a truly remarkable author, and the novel is really a masterpiece of 1980's satire. I honestly can't say enough good things about it. Every page was amazing to me, and I felt that a portrait of a madman had really been painted for us in a way that nobody has done before.The film lacked a lot of this detail, but it was only noticeable after reading the book. I can see how someone who read the book first, then saw the film could have been disappointed, but seeing the film before the book really made me appreciate both much more than I may have otherwise. For someone who has no experience with either the film or the book, I would recommend the movie first, then followed up with the novel. The movie is very enjoyable and interesting on it's own, and the novel adds a tremendous dimension and back-story to the characters and their motivations.Also, one of the criticisms that I read in a previous review had to do with the locations not being believable due to the limited budget of the production. However, as a lifelong resident of Manhattan, the sets and locations ring very true. Pat Bateman's apartment in the movie is a really accurate representation of what a multi-million dollar Manhattan apartment actually looks like. Money does not go very far in this town, and it actually states in the book that Timothy Price made approximately $190,000/year, so it can be presumed that Bateman earned a similar amount. A hefty sum for the time, but not quite billionaire status. The restaurants and offices are also quite realistic and believable, especially since I have actually been to most of the places that are mentioned in the book.Finally, after the film and novel, I have to say that I actually found Pat Bateman someone who I could really relate to on some level, scary though that may sound. The obsession with material possessions; having everything in your life arranged perfectly; the drive to have the best (clothes, apartment, dinner reservations, women, etc), is something that still permeates the culture here in NYC to such a degree that I found many of his obsessions (compulsions?) and mannerisms extremely familiar. Disconcerting as it is, I can easily see where Brett Ellis' mind was when he fleshed out the Bateman character. From this point of view, it's almost easy to see how such behavior can mutate into insanity without even the blink of an eye. It's certainly made me look at my own life in a different light.",8,17,26,6 April 2006
Tropic Thunder," One of the funniest -and smartest- movies ever.
","This isn't Citizen Kane, Quiz Show or Gone with the Wind. It's not overtly cerebral nor is it going to win an Oscar.It is, however, a truly brilliant film in its own right. One which takes a critical and hilarious look at Hollywood and all its inhabitants, insecurities, superficiality and social quirks and rolls them all into an extremely well-produced and accessible film, set with a backdrop of popcorn-style action.Every character, from the 'stars' of the movie-in-a-movie to Tom Cruise as the truly amazing Les Grossman and Matthew McConaughey as the overgrown frat boy agent was performed pitch-perfect. And as others have said, Robert Downey Jr. absolutely stole the show. He was quite simply a phenomenon as a 'dude, playing a dude, disguised as another dude'. The jokes are funny and well timed, and the humor is absolutely unflinching in its disregard for political correctness.I have to say, however, that it took me a couple of viewings for all of this to really become apparent. I went into my first viewing expecting something funny and worthwhile, but was not prepared for what I got. After my second and third time I really began to appreciate how truly clever this film actually is. It helps if you have some understanding of Hollywood and the movie business in general... I could honestly see a good deal of the humor going over some heads (which probably accounts for some of the bad reviews here), as well as foreigners, who probably just don't understand this type of humor at all.Either way though, its definitely my opinion that Tropic Thunder is one of the best films of the 21st century thus far. Watch this movie.",10,1,5,16 June 2009
Bridesmaids," NOT the movie that was advertised, but still a good one.
","I had heard rave reviews about this film, and was genuinely excited to see it. The trailers were great, and the premise seemed to be very funny; the anti-chick-flick, but done in a way that both sexes could enjoy. It was NOT, however, the film that the trailers made it out to be-- which is to say, 'The Hangover', except with a female cast. You know; a motley crew of misfit bridesmaids get increasingly deeper into raunchy and improbable situations, and hilarity ensues. While these were some of the elements, it's NOT what the film was about at all. This most definitely IS a chick flick, no two ways about it. So don't go into the film expecting anything else. The plot is firmly grounded in well-trodden chick territory (bitchy and undermining BFFs, nice guy vs. bad boy, picking a wedding dress, female depression and self-sabotage, etc.)... its all there, and a far more prominent part of the movie than the heavily-advertised slapstick elements. Now, with that having been said, it is still a damn funny movie. There were a ton of truly hilarious scenes, and really well developed and relatable characters. It's not entirely the film that the trailers want you to think it is, but worthwhile nonetheless. Instead of 'The Hangover' with women, a more apt comparison might be 'Mean Girls' with grownups... of some combination of the two. Which really isn't a bad thing at all.",8,2,6,8 June 2011
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Hobbit: The Phantom Menace
","Okay, so it's not quite as awful as The Phantom Menace was, but it comes damn close to damaging the LOTR franchise in the same way TPM did to the Star Wars franchise.Let's review here:1. The story is damaged within the first ten minutes and never recovers at any point in the film. The fact is, simply, that Bilbo's character is never developed. We have no freaking idea why Gandalf chose him or why he's so important. We're given no reason to really care about him, and therefore it makes zero sense why any of the other characters should care about him either. The entire film suffers for this, because Bilbo is, essentially, the lead. And when you don't care about the lead, you pretty much don't care about anything else. 2. The tone is WAY off. Yes, The Hobbit was a children's book. However, the film needs to fit into the already-established LOTR universe, and it struggles to do so. The first half is filled with bizarre slapstick and childish humor more akin to Sesame Street than a LOTR film, while the second half attempts to take a drastic turn for the dark, making everything seem completely disjointed. It just didn't work.3. CGI disasters. Yep, Peter Jackson seems to have taken a page from the George Lucas 'How To Ruin A Beloved Franchise' playbook, and leaned WAY too hard on CGI for this film. I know there was quite a bit of CGI in the original films, but it was truly abused in this one. Far too many characters were pure CGI creations, and way too many scenes were set entirely on a green screen. CGI is best when its working in support of practical sets and effects, not when it's the only effect being used. Jackson struck a near-perfect balance in LOTR, but The Hobbit just seemed like one big cartoon most of the time. Bad. And made even worse by the fact that we already know what Jackson and his production team are capable of. 4. HFR is as bad, if not worse, than everyone says. Shooting this film in HFR was probably the single worst decision anyone could have made. Everything looks cheap and plastic. You can see the seams on the actors prosthetics, you can tell that the sets are cardboard, and the already-problematic use of CGI is exacerbated tenfold. HFR takes the magic out of films. Period. 5. No attractive, human protagonists. This may sound superficial, but the fact is that without a strong lead that people can relate to, your film is likely going to fail. Especially in a film that is filled with monsters and weird creatures and other oddities. It's really hard for people to empathize with characters that they either aren't attracted to or can't relate to on some basic level. Nobody wants to be a dwarf or a hobbit. LOTR had several strong, attractive human leads, both male and female. And yes, Frodo and Sam were indeed beloved characters, but they were brilliantly written and developed in a way that neither Bilbo nor any of the dwarfs were in The Hobbit. As such, the audience simply cannot emotionally attach itself to anyone in this film. 6. Completely impossible scenarios that don't even make sense within its own universe. This is a big one and it drives directly to the cartoonish nature of the film. There are several scenes, most notably during the escape from the Goblin kingdom, where the characters are put through a series of actions that are laughably absurd. Now, this is a movie and not real life, and nobody expects perfect physics. But everything still needs to work within its own universe, and the fact is that some of these stunts are just dumb and insulting. You'd never have seen this kind of nonsense in the LOTR trilogy, and this film should follow the same rules. Quite frankly some of the action scenes could have been cut out altogether and the film would have been better off for it. THE GOOD:A great scene between Gollum and Bilbo is very much worth watching. Highlight of the entire movie, and almost makes the rest of the nonsense worthwhile.",4,31,57,13 October 2013
Kick-Ass," This movie was GREAT.
","I saw this movie come up on my Netflix On Demand 'recommended' list, and thought I'd give it a shot. Of course, I had already heard all about it and was definitely curious to see what all the hype was about, and although I do enjoy the genre in general, I was certainly not expecting to love this movie as much as I did. In fact, one might say that I was shocked at how much I enjoyed it. Yes, I know it's wrong to see an eleven year old girl gleefully dismember bad guys. Yes, I know that vigilantism is nothing to advocate. And yes, I also know that if an average high school nerd put on a pair of tights and decided to fight crime, he'd likely end up dead. I can happily put all those concerns aside though, because the fact is that this is a tremendously well made film with a solid plot and characters you genuinely care about. The acting is superb, particularly by young Chloe Moretz who is surely a superstar in the making. The director obviously had a very clear vision of what he wanted this movie to be, and he hit a home run in execution. If I had to pick out something that I didn't like, it would be that most of the street scenes which are supposed to be New York City are pretty obviously not (as a native New Yorker this annoys me quite a bit)... I realize this was likely a budget issue, but its still something noticeable. The only other thing I would possibly complain about is that I feel the jetpack/gatling gun gadget that Kick Ass used in the end was just a tiny bit too much... I think they could have accomplished that scene a little better. But honestly, these are very minor flaws in an otherwise outstanding film. Yes, it's not a movie for everyone, and there are going to be many people who aren't going to be able to get past the imagery of a tarted-up preteen girl brutally killing criminals while making profane wisecracks. And that's fine... I totally understand where they're coming from. But if you can briefly suspend your own sense of reality for a couple of hours, you're sure to enjoy it.",9,2,6,16 May 2011
Transformers," Truly the most awesome movie of our generation.
","Yeah, it was all that and more. Sure there was a dubiously thin plot. Sure the entire premise was questionable at best. Sure the dialog ran into some pretty hokey territory on several occasions. And sure, the entire movie revolves completely on special effects and CGI. But all of this adds to the sheer awesomeness of the experience. You know it, the rest of the audience knows it, the actors know it and Michael Bay sure as hell knows it. Because he used every trick in the book to make a movie that people will be in awe of for a very long time into the future. Not for its artistic value or for its contribution to society, but for the sheer pleasure you can take in its vapidness. Its fun to the extreme, and doesn't even try to make any apologies for what its not. Not many movies can say that.Sure, people will point out continuity errors, or explain that the love story was somewhat forced, or that most of the cast achieved Shatner-levels of overacting. But these people are fools and snobs who need to loosen up and get a sense of humor.So yes, go see Transformers; the first episode in what is sure to be a long line of sequels. Worth every penny.",9,2,6,7 July 2007
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Never thought anything would make the prequels look good, but here we are.
","I'm not going to write a long review here, because many others have covered the many, many problems with this film. From the weak characters, to the lazy and nonsensical writing, to the total disrespect for the franchise... it's just not a good movie. Never -- not even during the prequels -- did I find myself shaking my head in utter disbelief as I did during The Last Jedi. Mind you, this was technically a far better movie than the prequels. The effects were better, the acting was better, the cinematography was better... which just makes it so much more inexcusable that SO MANY poor decisions were made on the part of the writers and director.At least the prequels were TRYING to recapture the Star Wars magic, even if they mostly failed. The Last Jedi was deliberately destroying that magic. And even THAT wouldn't be so bad if it was done competently. But it wasn't. The story was nonsensical. Full of plot holes and wasted time. The action sequences, while visually appealing for the most part, at best lacked consequence -- and at worst could have been mistaken for the CGI-laden cartoon action of the prequels. It's a shame too, because The Force Awakens -- for all its flaws -- was actually a thoroughly enjoyable and promising movie. I cared about the characters in that film -- largely the same cast as The Last Jedi. However in this movie they've become one-dimensional and boring. I genuinely didn't care if any of them lived or died, and frankly by the end I was rooting for Kylo Ren to win -- as he's the only remotely compelling character in the whole movie.I'm afraid this will probably be the last Star Wars movie I actually pay money to see. These characters have been ruined, and unless the next film is an absolute masterpiece, I'm pretty much done here.",2,2,3,20 December 2017
The Hangover Part II," Better than I thought
","Maybe it's because I went into this movie with low expectations from having read so many bad reviews, but I thought Hangover 2 was fine movie. Yes, it's almost the same as the original. But it's also completely self-aware in that regard, and for that reason I really can't hold the similarity against it. It's part of the shtick. The ensemble continues to have great chemistry and the politically incorrect humor is darker than the first movie (an appreciated improvement), but almost always very funny. I don't know what else people were expecting to see here. No, it's not a perfect film, and a few things didn't work; Mason Lee was awful as Teddy - an admittedly small role, but he sucked the life out of every scene he was in nonetheless. And there were a few moments when Alan's antics were more frustrating than humorous.I just don't think it deserves all the bad reviews and disappointment.",8,4,6,14 June 2012
A Clockwork Orange," Almost completely unwatchable.
","This was not a 'brilliant' film. This is a bandwagon film. It's cool to rave about how life changing and beautiful of a masterpiece it is. Some even go so far as to say that this is the greatest film ever made (or one of them at least).Sorry, but the emperor has no clothes.I'm a fan of Kubrick. He does amazing work in general. A Clockwork Orange, however, is not a very good example of his talent. It is self-indulgent and shallow, with violence purely for the sake of shock and no greater lessons to be learned. Ah, but you say, therein lies the brilliance! Nope, I don't buy it.This films' entire world is patently two-dimensional (to its discredit) and, quite frankly, boring. I had to attempt to watch the film several times before I finally made my way through its entirety, as I found myself simply turning it off out sheer boredom. The visual style is interesting, I'll grant that. But nothing else about the characters, story or message (such as it is) was able to hold my attention at all. Its gibberish, then violence, then more gibberish, then more violence, The End.I don't see how any intelligent individual can walk away from this film thinking it was good in any way. And I'm not making a moral judgment at all, mind you. Yeah, the characters are reprehensible... but that is beside the point. You can have a great movie with reprehensible characters... just not when you hang the entire premise of the film on some pornography of violence, then wrap it up in pseudo-intellectual claptrap and hope people are so confused that they mistake laziness for brilliance.In this case, that particular gambit seems to have worked, as 'smart' and 'cool' people all agree in unison that Clockwork Orange is a great film. Unfortunately, it is not.",4,6,15,14 July 2010
The Departed," Scorcese is the best filmmaker of our generation.
","The departed is yet another masterwork in a long career of masterworks for Martin Scorcese. Thank God he finally won an Oscar.I am reluctant to say that this was his best film ever, only because so many of his others were just so solidly excellent that its really difficult to pick a favorite.DiCaprio was/is an acting phenomenon, and Matt Damon and Alec Baldwin turn in the best performances of their careers. As did Mark Walburg and basically every other person who was on camera in this film. But Scorcese has always had the uncanny ability to wring the absolute best from his actors. And as usual, his use of music and score add a dimension that just takes the story to another level completely. It all comes together in such a magical and astounding way that you get up from the film with the feeling that you've just experienced something truly great. And its not often that you walk away from a film with that feeling.All I can say is that I can't wait for his next effort.",9,0,1,16 March 2007
X-Men: First Class," WHAT is with all these good reviews???
","Seriously. Where are all the good reviews coming from? Yeah it was cool to see Xavier and Magneto as young people. Yeah the Cold War storyline was interesting and had a ton of potential. Unfortunately, that potential was utterly squandered in an absolute mess of sloppy filmmaking. Rather than write a long-winded, critical essay, I'll just make a list of the awfulness:1. Plot holes big enough to drive an aircraft carrier though. So Xavier has equipment that allows him to find mutants all over the country. And he finds a group of dumb, undisciplined kids with powers of varying uselessness. Dragonfly-stripper-girl? Really? 2. Absolutely useless and insulting cameo by Wolverine. In the horrible montage in which Xavier and Magneto go out searching for the useless mutants, they come across Wolverine sitting at a bar, who tells them to 'f*ck off' before they can get two words out, at which point they just turn right around and walk out. You'd think that they'd at least TRY to convince the one mutant on their list who has extensive military training and sharply-honed instincts to join them. And since Xavier has these telepathic abilities, he'd know that Wolverine is also involved with another secret military operation, a fact which juuuuuust might be of some use to him as he builds his team and looks for resources. 3. They fly around in a modified SR-71 with a big internal passenger bay and the ability to hover. Really? I know they're going for a period vibe, but they couldn't come up with something original instead of insulting our intelligence by using a famous aircraft design and bastardizing it in the most ridiculous way possible?4. Horrible CGI effects. Seriously, were the CGI guys from Babylon 5 the only ones available?5. Kevin Bacon. As a Nazi war doctor. Need I say more?6. Completely implausible and insulting reasons for Magneto and Mystique to flip on Xavier. Especially Mystique. 7. The fight between the mutants is probably the worst combat scene ever put on film. Literally.8. Did I mention Kevin Bacon? Yeah, because he and January Jones also start the Cuban Missile Crisis. 9. 1950's period setting is completely phony and feels totally tacked on. There's probably a lot more, but this is just what leaps to mind immediately. It was really THAT bad. I'm giving it four stars because the director managed to keep the boom microphones out of all the shots, and the camera upright. Also January Jones has a spectacular rack and the chick that played Mystique was cute as well.",4,4,7,16 July 2011
Casino Royale," Brutally Wonderful/Wonderfully Brutal
","As many have already trumpeted, James Bond is triumpantly back, and his name is Daniel Craig.More accurately, I think the phrase should be that James Bond has finally arrived, as I think this Bond is the closest to the true spirit of the character that anyone has ever come.Stripped of his fantastical gimmicks and gadgets, this Bond is a human being, who bleeds, feels pain, makes mistakes and has flaws, but does his job exceedingly well. All traits that previous Bonds have been conspicuously devoid of. Past writers have thought removing the humanity from Bond made him cool. But Craig is easily the coolest Bond ever, exactly because of his humanity. He's cold, but you can see that he makes an effort to be cold. And that makes all the difference here.Furthermore, I think that this is also the closest we've ever seen to what an actual 'James Bond' type agent would be like if he were to exist in reality. Wickedly smart, resourceful, psycholologiclly damaged, fiercely loyal, and with a general sense of barely constrained madness, all coming together to serve whatever mission is laid before him. If an actual person were in this role, this is likely an accurate portrait.As for the film itself, there is not much room for improvement. It has all of the usual beauty and exotica one expects from a Bond film, but has been stripped of the superfluousness. No laser-watches and invisible cars, or utterly unbelievable plot devices. The acting is solid, the writing is sharp and very very smart, and the cinematography is outstanding. The fight scenes are absolutely brutal and realistic in such a fantastic way that words really fail to describe the experience. And there is one torture scene that nobody will soon forget, and in my mind seals the deal regarding my high opinion of Daniel Craig in this role.My only reservation here is that they've set such a high bar with this film, I worry the next one will inevatably be something of a disappointment. I lend part of the credit on this film to the fact that it is the first one in a very long time to be based on an actual Ian Flemming novel. I hope there is another one out there that can be adapted for film, or that a new script can be developed that captures the same magic that was unleashed in this one.",9,2,5,21 March 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," Best action since 'Casino Royale'
","I didn't think this was as good of a movie as 'Casino Royale', or the original 'Die Hard' (which is the gold standard of modern action movies) but this is certainly one of the best action flicks to come along in a while. Not the most believable plot ever written either, but it's not entirely outrageous, and provides a reasonable stage for Bruce Willis to act out his John McLane in a way that is extremely entertaining and memorable.Bruce Willis maintains all of the John McLane wit and attitude that fans love, but he's an older, more confident version of the character in this film. He's obviously been through this a few times before, and a lot of his self-disbelief that was a hallmark the first film is gone here; he's seen it all before, and goes about his ass-kicking in a very straightforward and almost businesslike manner this time around. Mind you, he's never the stereotypical cocky action-hero, but he's clearly much more accepting of his situation, and his role in it.Justin Long is also very enjoyable, providing a humorous foil to McLane's machismo, with complaints about his blood-sugar and asthma contrasting to John beating and shooting his way through bad guys. I was worried that it would get tiresome, but it never really did; I have to say that Long is a very good actor, and he and Willis have great chemistry.As mentioned in another review here, some of the hacker/tech scenes were a little hokey, and a lot of people these days have a pretty good understanding of technology and realize that some of the feats the super-hackers pull off aren't exactly possible, regardless of their skill. But this doesn't really hinder the entertainment value of the film.The action scenes are fantastically choreographed and shot, and have a level of brutal realism that reminded me of Casino Royale, which is a very good thing. Personally, I could have done without the scene with the fighter jet, but oh well.Overall, it was a really good movie for what it is; a fun summer blockbuster action sequel. Worth every penny of the admission.",9,0,3,30 June 2007
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Great Movie, Period.
","First off, all the people giving this film low ratings just because their particular idea of what Star Wars 'should' be wasn't followed are all crazy. Crazy and wrong. There are legitimate criticisms to be made about The Force Awakens, but any reasonable analysis should see it for what it is -- a damn good Star Wars movie. Yes, Rey is a Mary Sue. She just is, and all the people arguing against that point are just as wrong as the people who think the movie sucked. There's no real way to argue that she's not a perfect character who picked up on her skills a bit too fast to make sense. Rey is indeed a Mary Sue. It doesn't matter.Yes, the film follows the same template as A New Hope. Same beats, same general storyline, same overall goals. Definitely. It doesn't matter. Yes, the leads were chosen mostly because of a politically correct desire to get a woman and two minorities into the hero roles. This is also pretty obviously true. It doesn't matter. What this film has going for is are characters that are genuinely likable, a story that is interesting while also being fun and whimsical, and cinematography, set design, and special effects that are absolutely brilliant which build a universe that you have no problem buying into. This -- above all -- is a fun movie, and it's true to the original Star Wars narrative a hundred percent. The fact that the overall plot echoes so closely to A New Hope is actually a strength, I believe. It shows that history always repeats itself, and children are destined to walk in the footprints of their parents. It's a powerful message and I think it's one that is totally consistent with the entire story of Star Wars, with it's focus on the inescapable father/son/family dynamic and how there's really no escaping your destiny. I have no complaints there. Rey being a Mary Sue was frankly only something I picked up on after I left the theater and gave it some thought. The fact that I didn't think of it during the movie is a testament to how great the writing was, but even now that I've come to the realization I just don't care. She was a very likable character, and frankly I can see explanations for most of her skills. It was established early in the film that she was resourceful and could handle herself in a fight, that she was good with machines, and that she could easily climb and scale the walls of massive starships. And I think her force powers came to her when Kylo Ren was attempting to enter her mind -- himself nowhere near as skilled or disciplined as a true Jedi master, and it backfired on him. Instead of Kylo entering her mind, she entered his and learned all about the force in that one instant. I can buy that, I just wish it was made a little more clear on screen. J.J. Abrams had ONE overall job here -- to make Star Wars fun again. And he accomplished that beautifully. After the dreadful prequels, we needed a group of characters that everyone could enjoy and care about and a story that actually took you for a magical ride. We got that here. It was fantastic and I look forward to the next films.",9,6,47,5 January 2016
300," Kind of disappointing.
","OK, I know that everyone thinks that this movie what just the greatest thing ever, and I can see why-- it was engaging and visually superb. And I can appreciate all of that.But honestly, I have to say that it didn't really pull me in at any point. With Sin City, the experience was so engrossing that I felt a connection with each of the characters, and I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen for a minute. I just didn't have that feeling here.For whatever reason, I just couldn't get into it. Part of it I think has to do with the original material. The story of Themopoli is really a very simple one, which I suppose doesn't lend itself to character development.Either way, the film is worth seeing for the visuals alone. And the acting was well above average. Enough people seemed to love it, so definitely give it a shot.",6,7,17,25 March 2007
The Great Gatsby," Brilliant. Maligned for no good reason.
","Here's another film that's been torn apart by critics for absolutely no good reason whatsoever. In fact, I delayed seeing it because I'd heard so many bad reviews that I didn't bother until I could find it online. I figured that if they couldn't make a good Gatsby film with Robert Redford, Baz Luhrmann didn't stand a chance, even with Leo DiCaprio. What a mistake. Mind you, it's not entirely perfect... I'd have done just a few things differently, and the choice of integrating modern music into a period film like this can be jarring, especially in the beginning. But after the first twenty minutes or so everything really does come together, and it becomes a beautiful, colorful, and engrossing film. The performances are absolutely wonderful, especially DiCaprio, who is spot-on and captures the Jay Gatsby character perfectly. I really was shocked and amazed at how incredibly good this turned out to be. I wish that I'd have seen it in the theater.",9,0,2,11 December 2013
The Island," Entertaining if you can get past the ridiculousness.
","OK, so this isn't meant to be a very cerebral picture. Its an action movie.With that having been said, I found it to be a lot of fun, as long as you can suspend your disbelief in a big way. A very big way.I can list lots of ways that this movie is beyond believable. For one thing, Jordan and Lincoln were chased through Los Angeles by paramilitary commandos who shot up half the city and killed two cops, with barely any notice from law enforcement. Or that if society possessed the technology to clone entire functional humans, it would easily have the ability to simply grow individual cloned organs which would be far cheaper and less complex for all kinds of reasons. Or that apparently, 50 years from now everyone drives a 2006 Chrysler 300.But the one fatal flaw in this storyline has to do with the entire premise that all of these thousands of clones live in a massive secret facility together. And that flaw is the one that plagues all conspiracy theories. Quite simply, it would be totally impossible to keep a secret that big. Literally hundreds of scientists, engineers, support staff and janitors work at the facility. All of them would have to keep it quiet. There are no disgruntled former staff? Even the low-paid janitors keep the secret, despite the potential for a huge payout by talking to a tabloid or news program? Nobody had a crisis of conscience? Everyone keeps it quiet? Not possible.But... it was still a fun movie to watch. The cinematography was really good, the action sequences were very engaging and the acting was well above average. Overall, it was engaging, and I enjoyed it.",7,0,2,24 March 2007
