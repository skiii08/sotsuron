The Rock," how do you not love this movie?
","This movie has it all: a great cast, great direction and a great story. Sean connery is great as the James Bond type figure who got caught (you'll understand when you see the movie) and Nicolas cage is great as the chemist who really doesn't want anything to do with all of this action stuff. All in all, a must see for any action fan.",10,2,2,23 August 2002
Requiem for a Dream," Why is this only #44?
","I just got through watching this movie. I rented it because i kept hearing people talk about it and i figured that i had to figure out what the hell everybody was talking about. I had to see for myself, to see if all of what i heard was for a good reason. And it was. I have never seen a film that was so relentless with it's attack on its audience. Darren Arnofsky(sp) is a brilliant director that doesn't pull a punch and won't let any members of his cast do so either.  Addiction has never been captured on film like this before, and even though many will try to, i doubt that it will be again. I Put this movie in the same catogory as Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. This is the type of film that you can't let sink into the backround, you can't talk with your friends while you watch this movie. In fact, it's probably best to not watch this movie with your friends. But, no matter how you watch it, it demands to be watched. It sucks you in and then pulls you out. A must see for anybody who truly loves movies. 10/10",10,0,1,18 November 2002
Citizen Kane," worth all of it's hype
","*POSSIBLE SPOLIERS*From day one, everyone hears all of the hype of this particular movie. 'Classic' is the word alot of people use to describe it, and that word usually scares me away from a film as that usually goes hand and hand with 'boring', i mean, the bulk of classics are good films, don't get me wrong, but, i don't usually go out of my way to see them because they just move so slow, some of the techniques aren't as interesting as they were back in the day and the stories themselves can become very easily dated. This movie doesn't do any of that, in fact, even though it's 62 years old now, it still has an incredibly modern feel to it.There is in fact only one flaw that i have noticed, and that is at the very begining where they are showing shots of the outside of his manor and it is quite apperent that there are backdrops, but, you must remember that this was on a super tight budget over 6 decads ago. Besides that, the film is flawless. It tells the story of a man who was able to haev an extrodinary life and still not be able to be happy with it. This film is the kind of movie that inspires people to become film makers, as it uplifts without being cheesy, shocks without swearing or bloog or gore and speaks volumes of a man's life without truly telling all there is to tell about him. Citizen Kane is absolutely amazing, go see it if you haven't already, i'm pretty sure you won't get bored, even you film snobs that visit this website.11/10",10,1,2,7 September 2003
Memento," a complete mind blowing experience
","Mind blowing doesn't exactly describe it, but,  what does describe it violates imdb's policy against profanity, but, i think you know what i'm getting at. I rented momento because it was recomened to me, when i watched it was what i expected and more, the storing telling is that of genius and the charecters and the plot are as complicated as it gets. Rent this if you want a thriller that gets you guessing and keep you guessing and lives you with a general 'huh?' feeling.",10,1,2,7 July 2002
Memento," Amazing
","This movie is not for everyone, it's hard to follow and has more twist and turns then every roller coaster that you've ever been on, but, for people who feel that movies are meant to make you think and mess with your head, this is a movie for you.",10,0,1,5 May 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A Whole Hell Of A Lot Better Then I Was Expecting
","*POSSIBLE SPOLIERS*So, I don't really like pirate stories, and the idea of a movie based on a ride doesn't blow my skirt up either, and i'm not one of those guys who just sees movies because they're movies, i love movies, but, i don't have time to see everything out there. So, why is the hell did i go see this one? My friends Justin said that he felt that it was going to be the best movie of the summer, and i figured what the hell, i'll just go see it, if i'm gonna be an actor, i prolly won't act in movies i like all the time, so, it'll be a good excercise.There were flaws in it. The scene where Depp gets swung around the wooden poll, it is very obvious that it is a stunt double. Also, pirates that can't get killed fight on and on with their swords. But, all of that crap is ok, because, this is not the type of movie that is suppose have everything be flawless and to always makes sense. This is suppose to provide a good time, and that it does do. It would have been nice if some of the problems weren't there, but, they are a non issue just because of the sheer energy of the film. Depp's charecter and Depp himself also do this movie alot of justice. Depp's charecter, Jack, is a perfect example of a charecter that that does not need to have an arch, but can still be interesting threw it's dinamic. Jack doesn't change in the movie, your perception of him does, but, he doesn't, he's the same robber baron that he was at the begining. His performance of the role is also something to behold because he plays it with incredible comic timing and with sparking originality, which saves the part, because, as i said, it has no arch, Depp adds the dinamic.All in all, a good flick, i suck at deciding what number to give films, but, i think this is a pretty solid 8.",8,0,1,7 September 2003
Snatch," good movie
","I saw Snatch with a group of very loud friends, even though they were incredibly loud, I still enjoyed this movie emensely (sp?). It has what at first seems to be a simple plot (a bunch of people going after a diamond) but when you begin to peal back the layers you have one of the most complicated things that I have seen ever. If you liked Pulp Fiction, you should like this.",10,0,1,23 August 2002
Lilo & Stitch," a nice change of pace
","original, funny and actualy heart warming, this a fresh view for disney. this is true family entertainment that understands that just because there are kids in the audience doesn't mean that adults have to be bored out of their minds. for kids and adults alike. 9/10",9,1,1,26 July 2002
Pitch Black," rocked my socks
","I have liked vin diesel is everything that I have seen him in(XXX, fast and the furious), but, this has to be my favorite. Riddick is COOL as the greater of two evils. The movie itself has a great concept and the special effecs are well done. There is also good work with lighting. I say that it's a must see, and this is coming from somebody who doesn't like horror movies. 8/10",8,0,0,13 August 2002
Spider-Man," Oh Hell Yes
","Alright, so I saw this movie this movie on Saturday with the expectation that I was going to love it, I had loved the cartoon from the mid 90's (which was the cartoon that I grew up with) so I went in wanting my socks to be blown off. And I was not disappointed, even the fact that I was in the front row and to the side could not reuin this movie for me. The action sequences were amazing, the lines where memorable and the acting was just great. If you ever liked spiderman, as the comics or one of the old shows or had a spiderman fix that you liked whatsoever, or even if you just like movie's with great action, then I suggest this movie: 10/10",10,0,0,5 May 2002
The Fast and the Furious," not bad at all
","This seems to be one of those things where there are two types of people: ones who loved, and ones who hated it. I happen to be one of the ones who loved it, I unlike the reviewer who's review was the first one shown as I right this thought the dialog was written fine, vin diesel is a good actor, and that a large amount of this movie's apeal is in how the car scenes are shot. In alot of movies, when they try to throw cars into the mix, you get bored, the shots are too centered, it gets boring, everytime they race the cars here, the screen shakes and gives me (and anybody else who loved this movie) an awesum rush. All in all, don't believe what ANYBODY tells you about this movie, it's really the sort of thing that you need to see for yourself to know if you love it or hate it. See it for yourself and make YOUR OWN opinion.",8,0,1,10 August 2002
Men in Black II," great movie
","I loved the first men in black movie so i came into this movie expecting to love it, and i walked out having met my expectation. The jokes are are more frequent and the chemistry between everybody is better then ever. The action is also, well, great. I know this isn't exactly the most intelligent essay ever written but the bottom line is that it's a great movie and if you liked the first, you'll most likely like this to.",9,0,1,7 July 2002
Pi," Good First Film
","I saw pi a little while ago, I never thought to comment on it, not that i didn't like it or anything, it just never crossed my mind. Now that i have seen Requiem For A Dream, I feel that I should put in my two cents about this movie. I have to say that I found the film inspiring. It shows that you don't need money, magor stars, and tons of experience in Hollywood to make a good film. This movie shows that if you have a good idea and alot of talent that you can produce a work of art that just smacks people in the face. Defently a must see for anybody interested in movies and how far one can really go with film. If you plan on seeing Requiem for a dream, make a point to see this one first, that way you can appreciate the growth that Arnofsky went threw between the two projects. 9/10",9,0,1,28 November 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," I saw it three times already....
","*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS***I put the spoilers heading on the top of this review, just in case there are people who are really hard core about that sort of thing. But, I also must say that it is impossible to really spoil this movie for anyone by telling them plot elements, because you know what's going to ultimately happen by just reading the plot description. Eventually, The Bride is going to Kill Bill and everyone associated with reuning her wedding day. This is not a movie that you watch for the plot, and not a movie that you can enjoy being told about. This is a movie that needs to be watched, it demands it. Roger Ebert described it best when he refered to it as 'story telling without a story', this is exactly right because we have all seen this story before, hero gets wronged, and wrongs the evil doers. But, because Tarantino is so good at what he does, he uses every element he can to make this the most interesting thing imaginable. I have already heard people complain about the amount of blood in this movie; these people obviously didn't get the point: this is a MOVIE about MOVIES that has NO grounding in reality. It is a throw back to very low budget Kung-Fu films and also to film noir and spagatti westerns. The movie is almost a thesis on the simularities between the genres; by combining the elements together, you get to thinking that there were already many elements there in the first place; in all three genres, somebody has been wronged, usually someone important to them has died or they have had an attempt on their life and they are out for quick justice by killing everyone of them. In fact, many spaggeti westerns took plots from samari movies and vice versa.Quentin makes it very clear that the audience are his puppets and he is the puppet master controlling every aspect of the film. He of course has always done this to an extent, as in Pulp Fiction in Res Dogs where he jumps the story around simply for effect. He of coursse does that here too; but, in this movie he even goes as far as to bleep The Bride's real name out simply because he doesn't want you to know it yet; and he wants you to know that he doesn't want you to know.This is a tribute to the asian art of film making; he even goes as far as to make one of the chapters (if you didn't know yet, the movie is divided into chapters, five in this movie, five in the next) an anime sequence. This helps him bring home the idea that this is not an emotionaly serious movie, that the violence is cartoonish and that should be accepted, what better way to do this then to have a cartoon in the middle of the movie? This also helps him tell elements of the story, that if he tried to tell in live action, he would have gotten an NC-17 or X rating as opposed to the R rating he did recieve.There are slow motion shots in this movie, there are black and white shots in this movie, there's a shadow fight sequence in this movie, and a snow fight sequence. And those are just a hand-full of the elements that he uses. I've seen it three times already and plan on seeing it several more times before it gets out of theaters, this truly is the most entertaining movie to come out in a very long time.

Men in Black," Good Flick
","Apparently, some people did not like this movie, however, most people I have talked to like this movie so much that they watched it until they got completly sick of it (which in this case, means ALOT of  times). I have seen it just as many times as anybody else, possibly more and I am yet to get sick of it. It has a great story, great special effects, and pretty dran good acting. All in all, a good picture to be enjoyed by the people who want to see it (ie, fans of the whole sci-fi action comedy genre).",10,1,2,23 August 2002
Singin' in the Rain," amazing
","I love this film, always have, ever since the first time I saw it. This movie is what film musical's were all about, flashy, light hearted and a whole lotta fun. The singing is great, the acting is right on and the dancing is just plain wonderfull. Gene Kelly is obviously an amazing dancer, but, one should not overlook the equally amazing Donald O'Conner, who simply stops the show with 'Make Em Laugh'. Other good numbers include 'Moses', 'Beutifull Girl' and of course the title song. Anybody who likes having fun when they watch a movie needs to see this. 10/10",10,2,5,28 November 2002
Reservoir Dogs," crime at it's best
","My favorite movies are ones that are violent, humorous and thought provoking. This is all three. The screenplay is great and so is the directing and acting. Several things that make this movie worth seeing: (may contain spoilers, depending on how you look at it) the story manages to show before the robbery and after the robbery without showing the robbery itself and still have it be interesting. Also, it uses a radio like it were an actual radio (in the 'stuck in the middle with you' scene, it's noticable when you watch the movie). As far as I'm concerned those two things alone would be enough reason to see it, but, there are even more reasons to see it, just ask anybody who's seen it. Bottom line, those who have seen it, I don't have to tell you to see it again and if there is anybody who has not seen it: SEE IT.",10,0,1,22 August 2002
Casino," underated
","This is the kind of movie that I love, a deep charecter study that shows the development of people that are REAL people, i.e. they do things that actual people would do, they're not just one d charecters that you can't relate to at all. If you liked The Godfather, Pulp Fiction, or Resevoir Dogs, tyhen chances are you'll like this. 9/10",9,1,2,28 November 2002
Gangs of New York," one of the best period peices
","As a rule, I don't really like period peices, if for no other reasons then I find it hard to get into them, because it seems that nobody can realisticaly portray the past, it becames so incredibly obvious that it was made in the present by people in the present and overall becomes very boring. So, one might ask why i would go into the theater to see this in the first place. The reason being is that I love Martin Scorsese. And he, Leo, Diaz, and Daniel Day-Lewis make this genre, which as I said I usualy i don't like, interesting and exciting. This movie pays great attention to detail, and greatly focuses on the persecution of the Irish, something I think alot of people have forgotten. Overall, great film, higly recommended. 10/10",10,0,0,22 December 2002
