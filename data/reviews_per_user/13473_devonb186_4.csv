Casablanca," Casablanca
",I don't really like movies that make me sad and this was one of them. The movie was during WWII in a city controlled by the Nazi's. The spotlight outside Rich's bar made the mood like walking on eggshells. Humphrey Bogart was a great actor and I liked him the most. He had a great business and learned to make friends with the enemy. I didn't like Ingrid Bergman's character Ilsa. She seems like a tramp. I understand that a girls has to do what a girls has to do but I sympathies with Rich. I would have liked this movie better if the ending was Rich and Ilsa left while her husband stayed in Casablanca. Overall this was a good storyline but not something that I would watch again.,Null,0,2,17 October 2010
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Chemistry makes a movie
","Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was released in 1969. This is a great period for movies because the Hays Code had just ended. Characters were allowed to act differently than before, usually in sexual ways. An example of this is when Butch Cassidy had his girlfriend undress in front of him. The next scene begins with them in bed together. During the Hays Code married partners were not even allowed to sleep in the same bed. The acting in this movie was great. These roles were perfect for Redford and Newman because although they were best friends in the movie, they were also friends in real life. This created great chemistry between them which made the acting so natural and realistic. There was one problem with continuity after Stother Martin's character was shot. In the first scene he is lying with a branch across his face and in the next scene the branch is gone. This movie is one of my favorite westerns and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys action and hilarity.",Null,0,0,8 December 2010
The Grapes of Wrath," depressing depression
","The 1940 drama, The Grapes of Wrath, was made during the great depression. It was a very touching story about a poor family that loses their farm land and is forced to move to California for work. The movie shows the journey and plenty of hardships they must endure. Unlike other movies they can never seem to catch a break. Grandparents die, their trucks runs out of gas many times, a pregnant women traveling with them is very sick, and they do not have money to feed the children. This movie also shows the bad environments that they are made to live in at government camp and the terrible treatment of workers. Throughout the movie the family never seemed to be in a good place and it dragged on. It was very boring and I didn't need a two hour movie to get the point. I think that if the movie was 40 minuets shorter it would have been a better experience for me. My favorite character was the mother because she had to deal with so much stress and anxiety but always remained cool and collected.",Null,0,1,10 October 2010
The Graduate," Funny Movie
","The thing of love best about this movie is the acting of Ben Braddock. His character played a role of a college graduate that didn't really know much about life. He was very jumpy and scared when talking with Mrs. Robinson. He is especially jumpy when they go to the hotel for the first time and needs her to tell him what to do. I could not stop laughing. When her character seduces him at her house the camera breaks the 180 degree rule. I can relate to this movie because I am a college student and my brother just graduated law school. With the economy so bad he cannot get a job and has a lot of down time like Ben. I like the parts where he is in the pool just laying around all day. It reminds me of my brother and I hope when I graduate I will have a little down time also. The use of the pool also creates and ellipsis. I shows him going from the pool to the hotel to his room and nothing important is happening in his life. I like how the movie ends when Ben and Elaine are sitting at the back of the bus looking out the window. The expression on their faces looks like they are thinking, 'What the heck did we just do.'",Null,1,1,29 November 2010
