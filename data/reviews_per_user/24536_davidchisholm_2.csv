Insidious: Chapter 2," Derivative but Good
","Psycho, Poltergeist, The Shining and Sleepaway Camp. I mentioned these films because Insidious: Chapter 2 heavily borrows elements from each of these classic horror films. That's not to say its a bad thing for this film since it helps in its favour. Yes its derivative but its an entertaining 2hr flick. The film picks up right where the first Insidious left off with the Lambert family supposedly surviving after getting their eldest son back from a supernatural dimension. All seems well until physic Elise (Lin Shaye) is soon murdered by what seems like dad Josh (Patrick Wilson) or by something Josh brought back from the otherworld. After an unbelievably brief police investigation Josh is free of suspicion for now and the family move in with Josh's mother (Barbara Hershey) but soon after more spirits menace the Lambert family once again. Most of the cast from the original return including the two dorky paranormal investigators played by writer Leigh Whannell and Angus Sampson as well as a new physic played by Steve Coulter who first investigated Josh's supernatural occurrences as a kid and leads an investigation as who has come back with Josh from the otherworld. Good performances, story, visual and sounds effects and direction. Overall a decent sequel which I found as good if not better than the original which is rare in the horror genre.",7,0,0,23 September 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," A Dark Reboot: Spiderman Begins!
",I think the discovery of Peter's emerging powers is better handled this time around than in Sam Raimi's original film - Peter starts out with his hands sticking to everything and everyone - has uncontrollable webbing in which he has to create web shooters and has uncontrollable strengh which causes him to break things with little effort. like in the comics and original film a personal tragedy compels Peter to become a dedicated crime fighter while donning a costume. Meanwhile Doc Connors undergoes a transformation of his own after being pressured by a shady Oscorp employee he's forced to inject himself with his reptile serum that regenerates his arm but also transforms him into the nasty Lizard. I thought this film was well done. I enjoyed Sam Raimi's Spiderman films on a different level. Raimi's films seemed to have a more brighter atmosphere and used a lot of New York locales while Director Marc Webb goes for a more darker atmosphere and grittier side of New York. It's clear this film has a lower budget than the previous instalments. Andrew Garfield's portrayal was effective. He gave Pete/Spiderman an attitude and sense of humour. He could tap into the character's dark side better than Tobey Maguire did when donned the black symbiont for spider-man 3. Emma Stone does and excellent job as smart and resourceful love interest Gwen Stacy who is far more interesting than Kirsten Dunst's MJ Watson (or B.D. Howard's Gwen of Spiderman 3). She's definitely not the damsel in distress type. Rys Ifhan's Doc Connors is low key and somewhat creepy. Then again he is a mad scientist. The special effects on the Lizard are not up to par with part 3's Sandman and Venom but works on a 'B' movie level. Denis Leary has some good moments as Gwen's police chief dad and veteran stars Martin Sheen and Sally Field are just fine as Peter's aunt and uncle. Overall a good comic book movie.,8,2,5,12 July 2012
