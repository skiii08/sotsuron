The Lobster," A unique and interesting yet dull film
","I feel like no matter how many time I watch this film, I'm never going to
'get it'. I can see the commentary on modern relationships and such, but so much of it just doesn't make sense and I'm not sure it's supposed to. The less you now about The Lobster going in, the better the experience will be, so I'll keep it brief and spoiler free. The biggest things that the movie has going for it is the story, which is insane and for every question it half answers, I have three more. The movie is essentially two distinct parts and while I loved learning about how the world worked in the first half, the second half slowed down and stopped addressing my questions. There is too much that they won't explain and instead try and lead you on to another thing. Beyond the very interesting story, there really isn't much else going on. Every character talks in the same emotionless monotone, which sometimes adds to the very dry humor and other times just gets annoying. 'Dry' is a good descriptor of the whole movie. The camera shots are dry and static, the dialog is dry, every character has basically the same dry personality, the score is dry classical music, everything is 'dry'. I liked the story and occasionally found it mildly funny, but every scene left me wanting more. By the half way point, I was disinterested with the characters and much more intrigued by the world they live in and we learn so little about it. The Lobster is one of those movies that can't possibly find financial success, because it's hard to market to a specific audience. It's listed as a comedy, but it's not really funny, especially for a standard audience. The static monotone acting from everyone got on my nerves and I assume a general audience would find it even more grating. It's a very unique story, but the way it's told puts way too much effort into being 'quirky' and 'wacky'.",7,1,2,23 June 2019
The Expendables," Action filled nonsense, but fun nonsense at least
","The film is best summed up in one exchange, 'How are you here?' 'I just am.' You have to turn your brain off and just watch the explosions and fights, otherwise you spend an hour and a half asking, 'Why did the do that? Why are they helping him? What is their relationship, Is that really how that works? Why are they there?' The plot is nonsense and the violence and explosions are too underwhelming to make up for it. The acting ranges from almost good (Couture and Statham) to terrible (Stallone and Giselle Itie). It's the equivalent of a porno; you're really just watching for the action scenes and everything else is just filler. A 15 minute super-cut of the explosions and violence would be easier to watch. The only true highlight is seeing Randy Couture wear stupid hats. Unless you really like one of the main characters (not Rourke or Willis even though they are on all the posters) or explosions and couldn't care less about the story, I can't see how it's worth your time.",5,0,0,23 June 2019
Platoon," Realistic war movie with unrealistic warfare
","Platoon is a distressing, dark, and disturbing film, but far too often it pulls its punches. Right out of the gate, Platoon sees our main character, portrayed by Charlie Sheen, starting his tour in the Vietnam War. What follows tries to be a serious, realistic vision of the war and its effects on our soldiers. For the most part, it succeeds. The story itself is the standard Vietnam story with some added dramatic elements and about half of the acting is pretty great (there are a lot of future stars here that I wasn't expecting to see). The other half of the cast ranges from below average to awful, but I'm not expecting an A+ cast in a war movie. My main issue is that even though they do express the atrocities of the Vietnam war and almost all of the characters felt real and I cared about what happened to them (whether I was invested in their survival or praying for their demise) even without contextualizing anything, Oliver Stone really dialed back the realism on the violence. Rarely do gunshots feel real, either the actual shot from the gun or the impact, and the blood effects are pretty terrible. I can understand toning it down if the level of violence was also toned down, but aside from a few events that we hear, but the camera cuts away so that we don't see, Platoon still has a lot of violence and death. No one ever acts like they were hit by a bullet, they just all of a sudden collapse and are covered in blood, there is no reaction to the impact and quite a few of the actors seem to think that a bullet wound causes generalized pain and not location specific. We see a head shot, but beyond a little skyward squirt, the only blood we see is a smear across where the bullet wound should be. I'm not asking for Quentin Tarantino or Eli Roth levels of blood and gore, but if realism is the goal, it should be applied equally, especially if your movie is essentially meant to be anti-war propaganda, you would assume that he'd want to paint a full picture. The story is generic and the effects are bad, but it has heart and there is a level of enjoyment to be had just seeing all these familiar faces showing up looking a lot younger than we're used to (I'd recommend not looking at any cast listings, because finally hitting the credits and saying 'I though that was him!' is a blast). One thing that I'm not quite sure about is whether the Vietnamese and Philippine actors were just really bad actors (a good number of them are Vietnamese refugees that just happened to be living the the Philippines when they were shooting) or if it's a cultural thing. There is one woman who has a very convincing performance, but most of them are just blank mannequins that don't convey any emotion and sometimes smile when watching their neighbors die. If it was just the VC, it wouldn't even be noticeable, but when we see individual actors for any prolonged amount of time, it becomes clear that they aren't 'real' actors and are just trying their best. Platoon is a solid Vietnam War movie that hits all the emotional notes it tries to, but is missing any real artistic style. Basically, I wanted something more like Full Metal Jacket; unflinching and real, but with cinematography that felt like it belongs to a director's vision.",8,1,2,23 June 2019
