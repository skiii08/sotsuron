Insidious: Chapter 2," I was taken waaayy to the Further... Three times.
","I had the chance to see 3 times a screening of Insidious: Chapter 2, and I gotta say, it delivered. After seeing the first installment, The Conjuring and now this one, James Wan became one of my fave director's of horror. He knows how to scare me and not with the clich√©s horror movie scenes. He knew how to make a great sequel, starting right where the first one left off. The way he connected all the dots, how he took us to the first chapter was brilliant. I must say this one was not scarier than the first one but it simply found the unexpected times to deliver a great scare. I cannot wait for the third chapter of this story and see how it delivers. 100% recommended for the fans of the first one, and for those who has not seen it, they must see the first one to be able to understand and keep up with story and character on the chapter 2.",8,5,10,14 September 2013
