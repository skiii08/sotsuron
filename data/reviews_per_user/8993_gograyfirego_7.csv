Alien 3," For better or worse.
","Though this movie is not necessarily like the first two Alien movies, it stands alone as a great movie that is based on a familiar story. When I first saw it, I must admit that I expected an action-packed ride similar to what James Cameron gave us. But that movie was very different from Ridley Scott's view in the first movie. So, I tried to keep an open mind.David Fincher's take on the story is a grotesque view of just how bad Lt. Ripley's luck can get. And thanks to some terrific performances by many of the cast, Alien3 is (just like the first movie) a very entertaining Sci-Fi thriller.I agree with many, here, that the Special Edition is an improvement over the theatrical version. However, I also believe that both versions tell the story with great flare. Perhaps a lot of my view comes from being a serious fan of David Fincher's work since this movie. So, perhaps I am biased but I will maintain my opinion, nevertheless.",8,2,52,4 July 2008
42," Decisions...decisions.
","I am struggling to decide if my vote of '10' is for the movie itself or the amazing cast. Wait! Why not both?!?! '42' is a fantastic movie because it tells the endearing story of a great baseball player, Jackie Robinson. Though baseball is at the heart of the story, this movie has little to do with baseball and much to do with humankind. Mr. Robinson certainly proved his greatness on the playing field but also showed the strength that was necessary for a black athlete to endure (quite horrendous) racism and bigotry, in post-WWII America. It was wonderful to watch more and more people around Mr. Robinson understand and accept that he was a great baseball player and human being regardless of the color of his skin. Now...the cast. Chadwick Boseman and Nicole Beharie are sensational as Mr. and Mrs. Robinson. And perhaps there is another Oscar nomination being considered for Harrison Ford. His portrayal of Dodgers owner Branch Rickey was quite possibly Mr. Ford's best performance in many years. Add great scenes with Andre Holland, Christopher Meloni, Lucas Black, Hamish Linklater, and many others to make '42' a keeper for sure!",10,0,1,3 November 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Over the bridge and through the woods!
","I have to agree with many others that '...At World's End' is not as good as the first 'Pirates...' but better than the second. Regardless of that fact, this movie is very entertaining! It does a great job of answering what happened to Jack (excuse me...Captain Jack Sparrow) then proceeds to give the audience one heck of an adventure ride. For instance, what happens to Elizabeth when... hehehe! Just kidding! Some of you might not have seen it. Well, that shouldn't take too long. Every 'Pirates' fan should see this third chapter and help them get back some of the $300 million. Like I said - that shouldn't take too long because '...At World's End' is great fun!",9,1,1,26 May 2007
Cloverfield," A vote I can feel good about.
","I seriously gave this movie little chance of being more than just slash & bash craziness. And I believe that kind of pessimism made a huge difference because, when the end credits popped up, I was happy to conclude that I really liked this movie.It essentially starts with a party that seemed to go on and on but it became a great way to introduce the characters. And like comments by others, I think how the movie focused on the characters was terrific vs. focusing on the 'big bad' while dismissing the characters as film fodder.New York has sure been the victim of some phenomenal yet destructive visual effects and this movie might just be the pinnacle. Whether it was the 'big bad' itself or the perspective from a camcorder, this movie was visually outstanding.And the cast - Seeing Lizzy Caplan was a treat...especially after CBS dismissed 'The Class' just when it was getting great. And Jessica Lucas' time on 'CSI' has probably been child's play compared to what happens with her in this big screen thriller. The rest were terrific as well but you can see for yourself.So, it gets my vote for one of the best surprises I've had at the movies in quite some time.",9,0,2,27 January 2008
Hancock," Hey, 'Hancock' is a great movie!
","I don't know what some people expect of this movie but I think it was terrific! No matter what he does, Will Smith just doesn't disappoint and 'Hancock' is certainly no exception. Is it because there is a great story but it's not necessarily a non-stop action flick? This movie delivers on so many fun levels and I think it is really balanced well. It's not perfect but perfection is quite rare. Regardless, this movie is fun entertainment. Jason Bateman, Charlize Theron (dang, she looks so great) and the rest of the cast are just as wonderful as Mr. Smith. However, nothing or no one stands above Smith's incredible talent of delivering dead-pan sarcasm! I might actually go see it again just to hear some of those lines, again. And I will most likely own the DVD.",8,12,26,6 July 2008
Casino Royale," Pessimist turned optimist
","Okay, I have no problem admitting that I was not happy when I learned that the producers were handing Pierce Brosnan his hat. Then came the news that they were seriously considering Daniel Craig. Who?!?! With those issues in place, I was ready to boycott 'Casino Royale'. Then, as filming commenced, Dame Judi Dench vehemently defended the new casting. And then I saw 'Munich' which starred Daniel Craig. I started to re-think my opinion. I saw the first preview of 'Casino Royale' and I realized it would be worth giving it a chance. And I am so glad I did! This movie is fantastic! I agree with other reviewers that it was refreshing to see more emphasis on the story and not gadgetry and sometimes tongue-in-cheek action. The chase, that includes the crane-jumping sequence, is fantastic and a great introduction for Daniel Craig as Bond. Then it turns right around with a great scene between Bond and M. Dame Judi is so perfect for the role! Though I believe Mr. Craig proved himself early on, I think the 'chair' scene clinched it. Ummm, scratching an itch is sometimes necessary but...uhhh. And the ending should definitely secure the fact that Bond is alive and well. Anyway, I hope a lot of people see 'Casino Royale' because I believe they will be well-entertained!",9,0,1,25 November 2006
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A wonderful addition to the 'Star Wars' saga!
","'The Force Awakens' is great storytelling that is very reminiscent of the original trilogy (Episodes IV, V, VI) with a new boldness that hasn't really been part of the saga since 'The Empire Strikes Back'. It also is a great introduction to new characters and new worlds. Yes, the story may have a few similarities to Episode IV and perhaps one or two references to Episodes V and VI. However, unlike others who have posted on IMDb, I do not believe this movie is nothing more than a rehash. When evil powers are conquered, they tend to find ways to (or at least try to) do it better the next time. That is why, in this movie, we see a new and more sinister presence from the Dark Side and a First Order with a far more powerful weapon than previous military powers of the Empire. How often has it been said that history tends to repeat itself? Therefore, the fight between good and evil may have similar stories but may have different outcomes. This movie is a wonderful addition to the 'Star Wars' saga and I know many people (including myself) who have already seen it more than once because they love it. And I believe there is something to be said for its success when this movie may surpass the $1 Billion mark (worldwide) by the end of this weekend! May The Force Be With You!",9,3,25,26 December 2015
