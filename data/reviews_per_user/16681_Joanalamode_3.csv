The New World," One of the best if not the best of 2005
","I cannot describe enough as to how much this movie moved me. I have been obsessing about it since I saw it last night and contemplating seeing it again tonight! Between the way the movie was filmed, the perfect cast, the acting, everything was close to perfect. I am a huge Terrence Malick fan and this movie only reassures me that he is one of my favorite directors. I loved the music, the pantomime, the accuracy of that time period in the world. Malick and his actors performed so well I felt as though I was there too. I gave this movie a 9 rating due to the fact it was at times a bit slow BUT I found myself not wanting it to end. I would have liked to have seen more development of the Rolfe/Rebecca union but I was still so effected by this film I was crying before the last 1/2 hour left. Malick's films have that effect on me.",9,8,16,22 January 2006
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Underwhelmed Overstayed Overpaid Overall Crap
","Don't buy into this. Not QT's best...one of his worst. Rambling, long, boring, waiting for anything to happen...some fun little teasers here and there to spark interest but overall BAD. If you are looking at a true account of the Tate/Manson Family murders this is not it-2hours and 53 minutes of boring.",4,6,11,27 July 2019
The Lion King," If anything CG is unreal
",I can see why a lot of people gave this a bad review but I actually liked it I went in with very low expectations and came out feeling pause that of and happy it is a feel good film it's visually beautiful there is no violence there is no guns or bombs are screaming it's a visually beautiful movie with a very predictable storyline.,7,0,2,25 July 2019
