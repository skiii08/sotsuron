It," What have they done?!
","This movie was absolutely ridiculous! They took a story about how true friendship and love can overcome pure evil and turned it into a pandering collection of Stranger Things/80s style themed scenes. This movie isn't scary, it's just laughable. Where are the Dead Lights? Where's Hi-ho Silver? Where's the battery acid? Instead we get Richies NON STOP swearing (F this, F that, F you, F me), jokes about period blood and Pennywise actually trying to negotiate his way out at the end of the movie!",1,5,8,5 October 2019
The Revenant," Absolute oscar bait
","Yes the cinematography is stunning, that's very true. But it's also most of what the movie offers. It's a simple, age old story of revenge and 80% of it is just Leo crawling around on the ground, breathing intensly. It did not need to be 2.5 hours long",6,1,1,11 April 2020
"I, Robot"," Enjoyable, but..
",It's a cute movie and I did enjoy it. But so much of the dialogue is just plain bad and the chemistry between Will Smith and Bridget Moynahan is simply non existant.,6,1,1,14 March 2020
Room," A bit overrated
","It starts off really good but quickly slows down and gets a bit boring. The second half is mostly awkward silences and people staring into nothingness.
Dialogue doesn't sound natural at all and people don't react the way normal people would. It feels forced.",6,0,0,9 March 2020
Her," Cringefest
",No.. just no. The cringe is too strong in this one. From Phoenix' overly pathetic character to Johanssen moaning and giggling her lines. Its just too much,3,3,4,25 December 2019
