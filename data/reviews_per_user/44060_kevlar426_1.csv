The Blair Witch Project," Don't bother
","This movie was a waste of film. Only small children with overly active imaginations could ever consider this in any way frightening. I sat through the incredibly dull, but inevitable, building process in hopes there was a payoff at some point. It was not to be. Fifteen minutes in I was hoping they would all die after suffering horribly for there amazing stupidity. This movie lives up to none of its hype. It's unfathomable to me why they made a sequel. For those who want fear, try the original 'Halloween' or some Clive Barker.",1,4,10,30 October 2002
