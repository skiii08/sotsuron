Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," THIS IS STAR WARS!!!!!
","From the moment the Twentieth Century Fox fanfare began, I knew I was in for one hell of a ride.  Although I had a few problems with the film, The Phantom Menace rocked the casbah.  The CGI effects were incredible, and the action sequences have to be seen to be believed.  The acting was typical of a Star Wars film (think Mark Hamill in the others), but who gives a ****, right?  And yes, I even liked Jar Jar Binks; I figure, if this trilogy is going to be dark, we're gonna need some comic relief, however childish. In summary, THIS IS STAR WARS; there is no denying that fact, but it is also something different - so treat it as such.  Also watch for E.T. in the galactic senate.  I can't wait for Episode 2!!!",8,1,1,19 May 1999
Casablanca," The Best
","If someone were to ask me my favorite movie of all time, I would be forced to say Casablanca.  I know a lot of people say this, and all the naysayers who have seen it on TV or video may not know what all the hooplah's about. To all of you, let me say: See it on the big screen!!!It is an experience.The acting is impeccable.  It is the best Bogart ever, the best Bergman ever, and the best Raines ever.  The script is part love story, part anti-German sentiment, part film noir.  The dialogue is extremely witty; it's comparable to the other film noir, detective films of the time.The set-up is brilliant.  We have an isolationist American (Bogart), and evil Nazi, and a Frenchman who may or may not be on the side of the Germans. Hmmmmm, that sounds like what actually happened during World War II.  Do you think that means something?  Probably not.The love story aspect is superb.  Bogart is a typical tough-guy (as we like to see), but that is only his exterior.  He has been hurt by women in his past (something we can all relate to) and has become hardened to his emotions (again, the isolationist).For a movie that was filmed without a clue as to how it was going to end, it did pretty well for itself.  In a word: Incredible",10,1,1,11 October 1999
Fight Club," The Most Distubing Movie I have Ever Seen
","Slowly the face of film has been changing.  I guess it may go back to the structure of Annie Hall and that one little scene that was entirely animated.  Recently, the generic structure of films has been changing with the success of both Rushmore and Election; it is obvious that the look of movies is changing.  Then comes Fight Club.If this is what we have in store for the next millenium, count me in.  The look alone is worth the $8.25 I paid for this film.  From the microscopic, CGI tracking shots through the strange interludes and fantasy sequences, David Fincher took me on a wild ride from which I'm still trying to recover.The cast all gave brilliant performances.  There wasn't one point in the entire film that I thought 'hey, that's (stick name of star here)!'  They became their character.  Even Meat Loaf who has had a string of crap recently is awesome in his role as a testicular cancer patient who is looking for a release from his frustration and anger.Thus is the point of the film.  Fincher paints us a portrait of a group of men who are sick and tired of their lives.  Like Kevin Spacey in American Beauty, they are frustrated with their jobs and their bosses and their lives in general.  Everyone knows what it's like to be just so stressed out and pissed that you just need to hit something!!! ... and hit something they do. Fight Club gives these men an outlet to let out their aggression in an orderly fashion.  They move from Superego to Ego; their fights have rules!!!Now (SPOILER ALERT!!!!)... this movie does not glorify violence.  Once Fight Club becomes out of hand and starts moving into the realm of anarchy, any idiot can see that this is not cool.  These men, these Ego figures, become the Id - they essentially become Nazis.  They make soap out of humans, they all shave their heads and they are totally dressed in black.  I think of fascism.  Again, they become tools except now, instead of being tools of society, they are tools of their own collective Id.The disturbing part of this film is that the line between healthy aggression and unhealthy aggression is so finely drawn.  The characters move from one to other so seemlessly that you almost don't even notice it (like the subliminal frames in the movie).  In addition, why do you think Edward Norton's character isn't given a name?Put yourself in his position... that could be you.",7,0,2,19 October 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," What the hell?! A good South Park movie?
","I must say, I enjoy watching the South Park television show. Nevertheless, I thought that the humor of Trey Parker and Matt Stone was to random and mindless to successfully transfer South Park to the big screen.  Boy was I wrong.  South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut is a definitive '90s film. In a time where political correctness and blaming mass entertainment for societies ills runs rampant, Parker and Stone have managed to create a brilliant satire reflecting the ridiculousness of our society.  In the decade of school shootings, violence on the big screen has been replaced (in this film) by a raunchy curse-fest called 'Asses of Fire' starring the flatulent, Canadian duo, Terrence and Philip.  When the kids of South Park begin emulating their heroes, their parents and teachers become outraged, and instead of blaming themselves for allowing them to see the movie (the parents pay for their tickets), they blame the movie and the country that exported the film, Canada.  Parodying Disney and Broadway musicals to the extreme, Parker and Stone trace the blame game all the way through the the impending Apocolypse caused by the spilling of Terrence and Philip's blood on American soil (it is the Seventh Sign).  For however raunchy and crude the humor in this film is, it is not without purpose.  It makes the viewer look at themselves and where they stand in society.  In the aftermath of the Columbine shootings, who is to blame?  Is it the movies that kids see or the parents that allow their kids to see them?",9,0,0,3 July 1999
American Beauty," Terrific
","Let me just say that one rarely sees a movie with a perfect cast.  Here it is.  Spacey and Benning give career defining performances in what is hands down the first real Oscar/Golden Globe contender of the year.  In addition, the supporting cast (if one can call them supporting) is fabulous especially the drug dealing neighbor has these piercing eyes that make you hang onto his every word (just like Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs).The movie itself is a tightly constructed narrative that can really speak to the viewer if he wants to listen.  In a miserable, routine existence find something - ANYTHING - that will make you truly happy.  It's relatively straightforward.When seeing this film, note that it is a first effort from the director who does an amazing job.  The visual symbolism and the mise-en-scene is outstanding.  This is quite possibly the best freshman attempt at filmmaking since Frank Darabont made The Shawshank Redemption.",10,1,2,24 September 1999
Halloween," Creepy -- Really Creepy
","Halloween is one of those horror movies that you must see.  From the chilling opening sequence POV shot through the film's climax, this film is great.  Michael Myers appears out of nowhere and disappears even faster, and the fact that he is a living human (?) makes it brilliant.The only drawbacks are the fact that he just doesn't seem to die which makes him seem more of a supernatural being than a human psycho (which is scarier).  The other detraction is the sequence in which all of Laurie Strobe's friends get killed.  It just seems out of place for such a smart horror film.  Not that it shouldn't be there, but it almost seems like an interlude where the audience gets their cheap scares.All in all, classic horror film that loses its realism by the end and becomes a parody of itself.  Nevertheless, it still has some brilliant sequences that make up for it.",8,0,1,5 October 1999
The Iron Giant," The Best Animated Feature Since Snow White and the Seven Dwarves
","I don't have enough positive things to say about the Iron Giant; I just want to say that right now.  It was a beautiful film that reflects the Communist paranoia of 1950s America through a boy and a metallic alien in rural New England.  This movie is a genuine treat.  It is something that adults can relate to with the myriad of reference to 50s culture, and both children and adults will love its innocence.The film is drawn in a classical animation style like early Disney films to give the audience a feel of the time in which it is set.  Unlike recent Disney films (thankfully), The Iron Giant does not have any cutesy little 'friends' that serve as comic relief or to create nausea for the viewer. Instead, the filmmaker respects the audience's intelligence (both children and adults) by giving us a simple story that does not rely on embellishment to make itself more viewer friendly.  It doesn't need it.The author started with a concept - what if a gun had a soul? - and created this brilliant animated feature in the same vain of Spielberg's E.T.-The Extra-Terrestrial.  It stands as a testament to what animated films should be (it is possibly the best in over 50 years), but what's more, it stands as a testament to what FILMS should be.  I can't stress this film's greatness.  Just see it for yourself, and be a kid again.",10,1,1,9 September 1999
The Sixth Sense," The Boy Who Should've Been Anakin
","I went into the Sixth Sense without any expectations; after all, I wasn't paying.  Well let me tell you, I thought it was great!  I liked the visual moodiness of the film; it was almost expressionistic without the noir qualities.  It was very eerie.  I didn't even feel it was supposed to be scary except for the occasional cheap scare of someone jumping out of nowhere or the music suddenly appearing with enormous intensity.  It was just that that world was somehow different than ours - visually.I thought the acting was terrific.  Bruce Willis has never been better.  For a while, I even stopped thinking that he was John McClane.  He was simply a child psychologist trying to help a troubled kid.  The kid, by the way, was fantastic.  He is possibly the best child actor/actress since Tatum O'Neil was in Paper Moon.  This kid should have been Anakin in the Phantom Menace instead of Jake 'Can't Act His Way Out Of A Paper Bag' Lloyd; but I don't want to get into that.  This kid ran the gamut of emotions - fear, isolation, happiness, sadness, and confusion.  He is a better actor than most adults in the SAG.I was also a fan of the ending.  That truly made the movie for me.  The writer must have gone to the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari school of screenwriting.  It was (POTENTIAL SPOILER) a brilliant plot twist - the best since The Usual Suspects.When it comes down to it, the movie really knew what to do with emotions. The audience can really feel for the mother.  She loved her son, but she didn't know what was going on with him.  She didn't know what she could do for him; I'm sure a lot of parents have felt that way.  Scratch that - I'm sure a lot of people have felt that way.  Not only can we feel for the mother, but I felt bad for the kid.  Quite frankly, his gift sucks; you can really feel for him.  Every major character in the film can evoke the pity of the viewer from Bruce Willis to the father of the dead girl.  Bottom line: Terrific writing - someone knows what their doing in Hollywood. 
It's about time!",8,0,0,8 August 1999
