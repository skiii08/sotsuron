Sucker Punch," xploitation + game cutscenes x anime style / bad direction..
","Wow, what can I say? The first 5 minute of Sucker Punch draws my blood rushing to my head. 'Oh My god,' I said. This might be the coolest intro I've seen since Pulp FictionThe imaginary scene in this movie are spectacular, worth the ticket I must say. Expect many games and anime type cool factor and bad-ass-ness.Sadly that's all good things I can say about Sucker Punch.My friend told me that the title is a pun by itself. as I leave the theater I can't stop thinking that perhaps I'm watching a movie with 3 different directors working 3 separate part.1. The videoclips; full of MTVesque slomo visual with killer tunes.2. The imaginary visuals; superbly crafted cutscenes inspired and adapted from many games and anime. 3. The boring talks; doesn't add much to move the the movie convincingly. Blah blah blah, mumble mumble, sob sob.. what's wrong? It's too boring that they don't even add any background music as courtesy to the audience.All three part of the movie contrast greatly. I have no idea what they were thinking when writing this movie. The reason (if there any..) behind the disjointed reality are too shallow it insulted the audiences.",6,2,7,25 March 2011
