Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Pimple on the butt of society
","I don't need to watch this movie to know it sucks. Anything remotely related to Star Wars is incredibly boring and about as much fun as removing your own kidney with a blunt steak knife. It's just a show for little boys (or older boys who haven't grown up yet as is so often the case) who are impressed by light sabres and lasers and other such pathetic imaginary weapons. If I were given a choice between death and a Star Wars marathon, the former would be a shoe-in.",Null,0,1,20 January 2001
Saving Private Ryan," One of the most outstanding movies every made
","Saving Private Ryan is perhaps director Steven Spielberg's greatest works. It illustrates clearly the stark reality of war, using graphic images that previously have not been seen in more traditional movies of this genre. Visually, it is stunning yet disturbing at the same time however the shocking images displayed only further re-iterate the brutality of war. The comradery between the soldiers in the film is strong, and probably a pretty accurate account of the importance of brotherhood during times of war. All alone in a foreign country with little more than a backpack and a rifle to call their own, each man is dependent on his peers to carry him through and keep him going through such difficult times.If you have a weak stomach or prefer the glossed over unrealistic version of life, then Saving Private Ryan is not the movie for you - you should stick to cheerier films like The Sound of Music or romantic comedies. The movie evokes a range of emotions in the viewer, from laughter to sadness and I would strongly recommend it to anyone with an interest in history, particularly war and to those looking for a good, well-shot classic film.",Null,0,0,17 January 2001
