The Incredible Hulk," 'The Incredible Hulk': FAR better than 'Hulk'
","When I first saw 2003's 'Hulk', and the travesty that was the Hulk using his incredible rage and power against... poodles... I almost cried.However, I went into this movie and this totally made up for it. The Hulk did NOT look fake, neither did his enemy, the Abomination. I will admit, there were a few slow and ridiculous parts, but I heavily enjoyed this movie. It is a perfect movie to reboot the Hulk franchise, and it has won me over.The cameo of Tony Stark was a perfect was to end the film, even though it was a huge cliffhanger.8/10, -2 for some slow parts and mildly unsatisfying cliffhanger.",8,3,5,11 July 2008
