The Blair Witch Project," Amazing, gripping film
","I can't beleive i saw this, this film just blowed me away. Sure the first hour is really boring but that was the setup, but once night fell, my god, words can't expllain it. Voices from josh i think creeped me out the most, and the ending, who could forget that, what i didn't like though, was the ending, Even if it was really scary they should have shown the ghost or some of those news interciews that were on the trailers, thats the only complaint but above all else, this was a great film. i don't know why some people didnt like it.",10,1,2,28 July 1999
Sleepy Hollow," One great horror movie!!
","This has to be one of the greaterst horror movies ever made! It was definetly Tim Burton's best (I think), and it's practically the only horror movie where the slogan fits the movie-'Heads will Roll' and boy does it ever!!! The movie was funny, very funny, and scary! Johnny Depp did a great performance playing That Crane guy, and Christina riccie plays Katrina. All performers play really great, but you should pay attention because their is alot in the movie besides heads rolling.",10,0,0,20 November 1999
Armageddon," I think Godzilla was a little bit better than this
","This the most stupidest movie I have ever, EVER seen. I thought I would enjoy watching it but it was extremely boring. Luckily I saw it in school so I didn't have to waste my $$$.  First off, there was a bunch of over acting that didn't bother me. There were 3 collions, 2 from the asteroid. Why call this Armageddon, I don't know. This script is dumb. I never ever fell asleep during a movie, but in this I did. How could people actually like this mess? It was terrible ..stay as far away as possible/",1,1,3,23 April 1999
A Clockwork Orange," A great film
","This indeed was a great film, and I did not find it sick like everyone else was saying. I saw this movie on the dvd, but before i was like cautious about it because i thought it was going to be very graphic,like blood, graphic rape,etc. There was basically no violence, there was more sex. I thought it was well handled, it wand't a porn flick. This movie was very interesting, and i recommend it. The ending i didn't quite get, because his smile made it seem like he was crazy again, but then he says, 'I was cured alright' but very good.",Null,0,0,7 August 1999
Halloween," the best movie on earth
","this movie is sooooooo good.i first saw it the day after i saw halloween 6:the curse of michael myers(the worst halloween next to part 3(which really doesnt exsiste) ) i saw it with my cousin...and wow!!!! i was soooo shocked it was tremendously scary and the music helped it a lot.the scariest part in the movie was when michael stares at laurie when she thinks he's dead..wooooooo--shocking!!!! i think this is the first movie with chase scenes and a murder in the 1st 5 minutes of the movie. and it is especially scray when michael just stares at everybody while their either talking,eating,having sex,etc. and then they dont see HIM. he just disappears..sometimes i have to stop the movie because i get soo scared...i always think someone is watching me out side the window like michael does to everybody else...this movie is just soo intense...but some people don't apperticate this movie  they think its boring because the movie makes sense-----but they lke the halloween sequels(not counting h20 because that too is great) because its infested with gore but no story. these people include my cousin who just can't apperticate a good horror movie..like halloween...i also agree with roger ebert---he compares this to pscho------psycho is scary in its OWN way and the same with halloween but still halloween will and still rule the earth---    5 out of 4 stars",Null,0,0,17 January 1999
Carrie," excellent movie
","i wouldn't call this movie a horror but more of a strong drama or suspense because nothing happens until the last 1/2 hour. the music is strong it sounds similar to the exorcist and psycho, but this one's more creepy. this movie is awesome and even though some people think it's boring they're wrong. this movie is smart and interesting. 4 stars",Null,0,0,6 February 1999
The Sixth Sense," BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","This movie was soo terribly boring it's not even funny! I knew from the start this was going to be bad. It's the same thing over and over. 'I see dead people'...and..,.what's your point, we knew that from the trailers. This piece of crap movie is such a piece of crap. The acting was great, but the litttle boy crying throughout the whole movie p**sed me off, except when he told off the teacher. The blair witch had diiferent elements, this movie had the same one's. AND IT WASN'T EVEN SCARY!!!!!!!! I don't even know how people found this scary, it was just two hours of non-sense. And the jump scenes in the movie didn't provide any jolt for me since, yet again, it was featured in the trailers. TAKE IT FROM ME, you want to see a good SCARY movie, see 'blair witch' because that will stick to your mind. this was stupid",1,6,17,8 September 1999
Jackie Brown," tarentino's best!
","i thought this film was very very good. it wasn't that violent to attract its audience, but it had a great story. i liked how tarentino showed what each person did during the old switcharoo. he is a genius. and pam grier made a long awaited excellent performance. i recommend this film to every one who was a fan of pulp fiction. how come this wasn't nominated for best picture? this movie was excellent. don't miss it",Null,0,0,24 April 1999
