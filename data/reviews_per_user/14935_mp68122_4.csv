Mission: Impossible III," Better then the first two. This movie is one long adrenaline rush.
","If you did not like the first two movies that does not necessarily mean you should avoid this movie. It avoids being as confusing as Mission: Impossible and is less clich√© and cheesy as Mission: Impossible II.The action sequences are pretty intense and will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat.The movie does a good job with acting, Phillip Seymour Hoffman is great but he needed some more screen time and character development. Tom Cruise was good and hopefully viewers will overlook his crazy behavior and lifestyle in real life and focus more on the fact that he still is a good actor.The happy ending is a little bit cheesy.",7,2,4,22 May 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," Missed it's potential
","This film was good, it definitely had one of the better story lines, but some parts were a little campy. Many characters just didn't get enough screen time. I don't see why the rush the movie wasn't even two hours long. Had they made it 2 and a half hours or even 3 hours (probably pushing it) it could have been so much better because they could have added to the minor bits of character development that each character in this movie got. The acting jobs for many characters were good, but Kitty Pride and Callisto were pretty bad. The movie had awesome special effects and fight scenes. It also had a lot of moments you know were just for the fans. This movie was pretty good, but it's just depressing with maybe a teeny bit more effort into acting and script it could have been an epic finale. The scale was grand enough and the stage was set.Just some of the story parts that could have been developed into a lot more: Rogue's desire to be normal, Angel and his father's conflict with his powers, Pyro and Iceman's rivalry, Beast's powers making him look like a mutant, The Rogue Iceman Kitty love triangle, Magneto and Mystique's betrayal of each other, and Collossus( Who didn't get any character development whatsoever)",6,0,1,26 May 2006
The Da Vinci Code," People are too hard on this movie.
","People are being way too critical of this movie. I have to admit I expected a little better but it's still decent. It is fairly entertaining.The movie is more entertaining then the book but not as good as it obviously cannot obtain quite as much depth. It is not as good a book franchise adaption as the Harry Potter movies.The best way to describe this movie is a shorter, somewhat more rushed version of the book. People who describe this movie as too boring and dialogue heavy obviously haven't bothered with the book. The movie succeeds fairly well in terms of acting performance.",6,9,18,22 May 2006
Fantastic Four," Pretty disappointing...even when you save it for HBO
","Pros:+ 1. Jessica Alba in her underwear+ 2. Some nice special effects- The Human Torch, the final showdown+ 3. A couple of the Human Torches one lines were actually funny+ 4. Nice movie score by John OttmanCons:<ul><li>1. Jessica Alba trying to act</li></ul><ul><li>2. Taking a fairly serious source material and turning it into a cheesy, slapstick movie that fails to be funny or clever</li></ul><ul><li>3. Some very bad special effects-The Thing's obviously rubber costume-Mr. Fantastic stretching like someone made it on Photoshop</li></ul><ul><li>4. Julian McMahon's less then mediocre performance ruins what should have been one of the most iconic film villains of all time</li></ul><ul><li>5. Letting the director of 'Taxi' with Queen Latifah direct this movie</li></ul><ul><li>6. 'Why the long face Reed?' line</li></ul>",4,0,1,31 March 2007
