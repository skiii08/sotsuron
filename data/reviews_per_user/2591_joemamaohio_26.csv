"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," My Review
","Perpetual loser Dennis Doyle (Simon Pegg) has never finished anything in his life - and that includes marrying the mother of his child, Libby (Thandie Newton). He runs off on their wedding day, and their relationship has been strained ever since.Five years later, his son is growing and now he has to deal with Libby's perfect boyfriend, Whit (Hank Azaria). He learns that Whit is a runner for charity, and decides this is the chance he has to win back Libby's heart and actually complete something - by competing in a 26 mile run.The only problem is he is completely out of shape. He enlists the help of his friend Gordon (Dylan Moran) and neighbor to help him out, with hilarious results.Finally the day comes, and it's the biggest day in Dennis's life. Will be complete the race and win back Libby's heart? Simon Pegg is one of the most underrated comedians of our time (see 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz' if you don't believe me). Once again, he delivers comedic gold with 'Run, Fat Boy, Run.' Directed by David Schwimmer of 'Friends' fame, not only does the film deliver on the laughs, but also on the importance of finishing something important in your life, despite everyone's doubts. A truly hilarious and heartfelt film, one that shouldn't be missed.",8,1,2,23 September 2008
Alien 3," My Review
","She's back, and this time it's not so great.Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) crash lands on a planet inhabited by convicted felons with only y-chromosomes. Everyone else is dead, and she's the lone survivor...but she soon realizes she didn't come alone. An alien attached itself to the ship, and is now running free and killing the inmates and guards.With no firepower, little help, and an alien bun in the oven, Ripley once again has to battle for survival...but this time she learns the only way to really survive is to kill the queen alien inside her.One of the worst 'Alien' movies out there (better than 'Resurrection' and the 'AvP' series), there isn't much to this film like there was in the first two. It wasn't AS bad as how others make it out to be, but it's nowhere near the perfection of 'Alien' and 'Aliens.'",6,2,60,2 August 2008
The Incredible Hulk," My Review
","Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is on the lamb in South America after what happened to him in the original film. He had to leave his old life behind - including girlfriend Betty (Liv Tyler) - behind in the States. But the government, led by General Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), hasn't forgotten him. He enlists the help of Major Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to track Banner down, and they find him in a small South American town.Banner, who's been trying to research an antidote for his condition, has to turn into the Hulk again to escape and heads back home for a cure. Meanwhile, the government has been trying to replicate his DNA so they can create an army of supermen, and they use Blonsky as a test subject, and he becomes more and more evil, yearning for the power the Hulk has.Years after the disastrous 'Hulk' movie, they decided to try it again, and this time it was a success! Gone is the lame animations of the first Hulk, and now we're treated with even better - even darker - Hulk CGI. No longer can he leap across states in a single bound, but he's more human-sized, with tremendous power. Norton portrays Banner in a great way, and the overall animation of the Hulk and his nemesis is 100 times better than the original.",9,2,3,19 October 2008
Stop-Loss," My Review
","A group of Texan men led by Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe) have completed their tour of duty in Iraq and are given a hero's welcome in their hometown, as they should.When Brandon goes to turn in his army stuff, he's instructed that he's been re-deployed, thanks to a clause known as 'stop-loss' which allows the government to call back troops who've finished their tour of duty.Brandon is obviously upset about this, and tries to fight it by going AWOL with his best friend Steve's (Channing Tatum) fiancé (Abbie Cornish) as they embark on a trip to Washington D.C. to talk to the Senator who Brandon feels will help him in his cause.As he's on the road, things are home deteriorate. Fellow cadet Tommy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is facing a divorce and an alcohol problem, and Steve is battled with nightmares and anger issues. Meanwhile, Brandon also faces his demons as he realizes he too has been changed by the ravages of war.Sure, this is another political war movie (like 'In the Valley of Elah,' 'Lions for Lambs' and 'Rendition'), but it's got a strong cast and a solid script which draws the viewer in like never before. Yes, it does center around the negative aspects of war, but it also eventually shows the value of serving in the army and fighting for freedom overseas.",9,0,0,9 July 2008
Kung Fu Panda," My Review
","Panda Po (Jack Black) loves the Chinese martial arts. He's followed the furious five: the Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross) his whole life, while he works at his father's noodle restaurant.Then, one fateful day, he becomes the Dragon Master, and is trained by the five's Master, Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), to combat his biggest foe - Tai Lung (Ian McShane), a warrior Shifu raised from birth who turned evil after not being crowned the Dragon Master.Now Shifu has very little time to make Po into a warrior, but he slowly discovers that the path to becoming a warrior is different for every animal.The message that the movie gets across is that you don't have to be someone you're not to be someone great. Po is a fat slacker, but he moves into his destiny and learns the way of the marital arts, and is able to stand up not only to the other warriors, but his own doubts as well. Truly an uplifting film filled with comedy, heart, and kickbutt martial arts action!",9,1,2,9 November 2008
Alien: Resurrection," My Review
","200 years after Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) killed herself in order to save mankind from the queen alien that was growing inside her, scientists have brought her back - as a clone, and also cloned the alien inside her. They extract the alien and keep it safe, and Ripley wakes up with superior knowledge as to what has happened to her, and an uncanny ability - her blood is acidic, as is the alien's blood.A gang of roughs including Call (Winona Ryder) arrive on the ship to assist in an illegal transaction for the alien, when the alien (and some of her offspring) escape. Now Ripley must once again battle the aliens that already took her life once.Sure, it's not even close to being as good as 'Alien' or 'Aliens,' but when you stack it up against the recent 'AvP' series, it looks like cinematic genius. Weaver rocked it once again as Ripley, and it's really not a true 'Alien' movie without her.",8,1,1,3 August 2008
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," My Review
","Peter Bretter (Jason Segel) works as a background musician for television shows, including a show in which his girlfriend, Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell) stars in. Things are going well, until Sarah drops the bombshell that she's leaving him for another man.Distraught, Peter decides to go on vacation in Hawaii, but as luck would have it, he's at the same hotel as Sarah and her new boyfriend, musician Aldous Snow (Russell Brand).With the help of front desk clerk Rachel (Mila Kunis), Peter vows to not allow this mixup to ruin his vacation. As he begins to forget about Sarah, he begins to draw himself closer to Rachel, but of course, things aren't always that easy.'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is another extremely hilarious raunchy comedy from the people who brought 'The 40-Year Old Virgin' and 'Knocked Up.' The laughs flow like sweet wine and there's even some hints of seriousness from the characters. Sure, it has a predictable plot, but ultimately, the laughs are well worth the price to pay to see it.",8,0,4,27 September 2008
Resident Evil: Extinction," My Review
","Three years after 'Apocalypse,' 'Extinction' finds our heroine Alice (Milla Jovovich) on her own and in search of survivors. The T-virus that was unleashed on Raccoon City has now expanded all over the world, and now the majority of humanity are now the walking dead (they're never referred to as zombies), and the survivors are trying to band together.She makes her way to the desert of Nevada, and come into contact with her old friends Carlos (Oded Fehr) and L.J. (Mike Epps), who have joined with other survivors led by the gutsy Claire (Ali Larter).Unbeknownst to Alice, she is being tracked by Umbrella Doctor Isaacs (Iain Glen), after she thought she destroyed the homing beacon they placed in her during 'Apocalypse.' The gang heads to Las Vegas for food and gas, and plan on heading to Alaska where Alice discovered there's a group where the virus never reached. But in Las Vegas they're attacked by hordes of the undead, and Alice realizes that she's still being tracked.She heads to the Umbrella compound in the desert to settle the score once and for all, and to hopefully put an end to the virus for good.Just like with the first two 'Resident Evil' movies, 'Extinction' delivers on the thrills and action, but falls short on the storyline and characterization. So if you're looking for a film that has nothing but mindless action, this is the one for you.",5,2,4,21 July 2008
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," My Review
","He's back! Hellboy (Ron Pearl), along with Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) and the others are on a mission to prevent the dreaded and unstoppable Golden Army from rising again to destroy mankind.Hundreds of years after forming a pact with the humans, Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) wants revenge on the humans for destroying his forest. However, his sister, Princess Nuala (Anna Walton) doesn't want this to happen and turns to Hellboy to help stop her brother before its too late.Del Toro delivers yet another stunning epic action film, filled with satirical humor, unbelievable effects and spellbinding fighting. Everything you could ever want in an action film is in this one.",9,1,3,9 November 2008
Alien," My Review
","A crew of seven are returning to Earth after a space exploration project. Along the way they hear a distress call, but when they land on the planet, no one is there, except for some eggs. One hatches and latches onto Kane (John Hurt). Soon an alien hatches out of Kane and runs amok on the ship.As the crew members try to find the alien, they discover that it has grown exponentially and is thirsty for blood. They also learn there's someone on the ship who knew what was going on.'Alien' is one of the best horror/sci-fi movies ever. It gave us the heroine Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and an extremely disgusting and frightening alien (up until the time of the 'Alien vs. Predator' movies, the alien was actually considered a horror icon...now, because of those films, it's more downgraded).A pure horror classic, delivered with impeccable acting and precision, 'Alien' is a movie that shouldn't be missed!",10,0,1,27 July 2008
21," My Review
","'21' is the true story of Jeff Ma (who also has a small cameo in the film) - who is called Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) in the film, a kid who's incredibly intelligent with regards to numbers, and is recruited by an overzealous college professor (Kevin Spacey) to join an underground group of students who count cards and go to Vegas on the weekends to win at the Blackjack tables.Ben's in the club just so he can get enough money to go to Harvard Med, but as the money piles up, he begins to fall into the trap of greed. He thinks he can do no wrong, and he becomes overconfident and arrogant - forsaking his old friends, without a fear of repercussion.However, unbeknownst to Ben, he's being watched by Cole Williams (Laurence Fishburne), who works for the casino to weed out card counters. As Ben becomes more and more arrogant, he becomes more and more suspicious to Cole, and suddenly Ben's luck runs out in many areas of his life.With a blend of great actors, great story and awesome scenery, '21' delivers the drama with impeccable timing, and is well worth the time to see the film!",7,1,2,16 July 2008
The Shining," My Review
","The Torrance family...Jack (Jack Nicholson), Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and their young son Danny (Danny Lloyd) go to take care of the Overlook Motel during the winter months when its closed.As soon as everyone else leaves, Jack starts slowly descending into madness, and Danny starts seeing visions of dead twins. Danny also has an ability called 'the shining' by cook Hallorann (Scatman Crothers), who also has the ability, which allows them to communicate without speaking.As Jack delves into madness, he starts to hate his family, and soon leads him to try and kill them.Based on a Stephen King novel and directed by one of the world's best directors (Stanley Kubrick), 'The Shining' is listed as one of the best horror movies ever made, with good reason. The movie freaks you out! From Kubrick's stunning directing to the camera (how it shows the characters in the background, making the hotel look like one large evil place), to the music, to the sounds (like when Danny is riding on his little bike through the motel, hearing it run across the wooden floors, tiles, and carpet), everything about this film is just spectacular. And no surprise since it came from perpetual perfectionist Kubrick.",10,1,1,4 August 2008
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," My Review
","John C. Reilly plays Dewey Cox, a fictitious singer somewhat reminiscent of Johnny Cash, who takes the music world by storm from the 50's all the way to the present.When Dewey was a child, he accidentally kills his other brother (in a pretty hilarious way), and his father never lets him live it down that he would rather have Dewey dead than his other son.Years later, at a talent show (when he's only 14...yet it's Reilly playing Cox...so the humor is even more prevalent in the fact that a 40-something year old man is visibly playing a 14 year old), Cox steals the show, and also alienates himself from the older people in the community who think of his music as the 'devil's music.' So he goes off with his 12-year old girlfriend (Kristen Wiig, also visibly playing a 12-year old) and starts a music career. One year later he's a father and his now-wife is demanding he quit the music career. But he strikes it big with the song 'Walk Hard,' which becomes a #1 hit and propels him to the international spotlight.As the years go on and the hits keep coming, Cox is faced with turmoil (being introduced to drugs, problems with the wife, falling for his singing partner, the death of his mother), which leads him into a downward spiral to destruction...and ultimately restitution thanks to the help of the ghost of his dead brother who tells him what he needs to do to ultimately be happy.Featuring Judd Apatow's all stars (Jonah Hill, Justin Long, Jason Schwartzman) in uncredited supporting roles, 'Walk Hard' delivers in the comedic department as well as tells the faux biopic story of Dewey Cox in not just a comical...but somewhat dramatic...fashion.",7,0,0,9 July 2008
Step Up 2: The Streets," My Review
","'Step Up 2' takes place in the same area the first one did. It centers around young street dancer Andie, who is roaming with a gang of street dancers known as the 410 who have been terrorizing the community.Fed up with Andie's antics, her caretaker threatens to send her to her aunt's house in Texas if she doesn't shape up. With the help of her friend Chase, she gets into the prestigious dance school that the first movie centered around, and they try to polish her dancing skills, but she has street dancing in her blood.She gathers the 'unknowns' - students in the school that the higher ups feel have no dancing talent - and forms her own street dance crew to go against the 410, and a dance battle ensues.Sure, this movie has nothing to do with the Oscars, but it is an enjoyable film, 95% in part due to the fantastic dancing. It takes a lot of grit, determination and dedication to be such fantastic dancers, and these kids got the talent. That's what makes the 'Step Up' movies - as well as other movies of this genre - so successful, and enjoyable.",6,0,0,11 July 2008
Aliens," My Review
","57 years after defeating the rogue alien, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is finally rescued from space, only to face a different world. Her daughter - who was 10 when she left - passed away two years earlier at the age of 62, and she's facing harsh criticism from the company who sent her, demanding an 'actual' reason why she had to blow up the ship.Things change when people who live on the alien planet start disappearing, and Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) decides to reinstate Ripley so she can lead an army of Marines to the planet to face this alien. She reluctantly agrees, and they travel to the planet where they come into contact with not just one...but several...aliens.James Cameron ('Titanic') directed this magnificent science-fiction horror film, one of the best sequels ever made in any genre. Sigourney Weaver once again reprises the role that made her a star, and makes Ripley into one of the best action heroines in movie history.",10,7,11,29 July 2008
Tropic Thunder," My Review
","Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller) is an action movie star who hasn't had a hit in awhile, Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) is a comedy actor, and Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) is an Academy Award winning actor. Together they join forces in one of the most expensive action movies ever made, and it seems to be a dud. They travel to Vietnam, and, unbeknownst to them, become entwined in a war that's actually reality.With hilarious cameos by Matthew McConaughey and Tom Cruise, 'Tropic Thunder' is one of the most creative comedies to come around in awhile. It's very anti politically correct, and Ben Stiller (as producer, director, writer, and star) doesn't hold back the punches. Truly a daring, hilarious film that shouldn't be missed.",9,1,4,17 November 2008
Independence Day," My Review
","On Independence Day, alien spacecrafts have appeared all over the world. No one knows why they're here, or what their purpose is...they're just hanging out in the air. David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) discovers the truth...the aliens are planning one major attack on the entire Earth at once. Unfortunately, no one believes him except for his father (Judd Hirsch). David makes his way to Washington, where his estranged wife (Margaret Colin) works for the President (Bill Pullman). Meanwhile, Captain Steven Miller (Will Smith) is having problems with his commonlaw girlfriend, Jasmine (Vivica A. Fox) and her choice of work. She has a son from a previous relationship, and Steven acts like the boy's own father. He gets called to service to see what is going on with these alien ships. David is able to reach the President literally minutes before the attack commences. Soon all the major world cities are attacked at once, and it seems like the Earth is doomed.By far this is one of the best alien movies to come around in recent memory. The acting is excellent, the effects are amazing (especially for coming out in 1996), and the action is palpable. 'Independence Day' is everything a true moviegoer seeks to find, and delivers.",10,5,10,19 September 2008
Alien vs. Predator," My Review
","In the year 2004, Bishop Weiland (Lance Henriksen) leads a team of adventurers and scientists to Antarctica, where he's uncovered a possible pyramid.Led by Alexa Woods (Sanaa Lathan), she directs the team to the pyramid, only to discover they're not alone. A gang of roaming Predators have arrived, and they've unleashed the ultimate killing machine - a queen Alien who reproduces quickly.Soon the humans are caught between an epic battle between the Predators and the Aliens. Who will prevail, and will any of the humans survive? This is the only 'Alien' or 'Predator' movie to receive a PG-13 rating, and that should be the first hint as to how badly this movie stinks. The 'stock actors' are just cardboard cutouts designed to be sitting ducks for the Aliens and Predators. The weak addition of Bishop (a staple in the 'Alien' series) is totally uncalled for, and raises more questions than ever. I refuse to acknowledge this as an 'Alien' movie because Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) isn't in it - in fact, Weaver even said the idea was a stupid one...if only people listened to her.",4,0,0,4 August 2008
The Number 23," My Review
","Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey) has the perfect life, until his wife Agatha (Virginia Madsen) gets him a book that talks about the number 23. Walter becomes obsessed with the number, and feels that it's out to get him, and as he reads the book it seems more and more like his life.He begins to unravel the mystery of the number 23, and as he does so he begins to realize that there's more to his life than what he remembers.Jim Carrey can do comedy, there's no doubt. He can also perform well in dramas (such as 'The Majestic' and 'Man on the Moon'). When it comes to psychological thrillers, however, he should stick with his day job. His acting seemed wooden, and basically the whole premise of the movie is utterly ridiculous. 'Oh no, the number 23 is after me!' I've never really heard a story where a number actually killed a man.The movie itself is totally confusing, and seems to be filled with plot holes and inconsistencies. It's a surprise it was directed by renowned director Joel Schumacher ('Phone Booth,' 'The Client'). It seems like it was directed by a first-timer who had too much time on his hands.",4,3,5,24 July 2008
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," My Review
","Picking up where 'Resident Evil' left off, 'Apocalypse' centers around the Umbrella Project and the Hive - the place where the T virus was unleashed, turning humans into the living dead. Umbrella decides to try to re-open the Hive, but the creatures escape and begin to wreak havoc on Raccoon City.Alice (Milla Jovovich) from the first film is in a containment facility, and awakens to realize that she has been injected with the T-virus, but it had a different effect on her - she's not a zombie, but she has superhuman strength. She escapes and tries to find a way out of the city, along with police officer Jill (Sienna Guillory), Umbrella military man Carlos (Oded Fehr) and civilian L.J. (Mike Epps).They find out from an Umbrella doctor that they're about to level the city, and the only way out is for them to find his young daughter who is trapped in the school, so they go find her. Meanwhile, Umbrella releases their most deadly agent - Nemesis - a huge hulking bulk who's part man, part monster, and is almost unstoppable.Sure, there's not a lot of character development or worthy acting, but a movie like this isn't designed for that. It's designed to bring the audience some thrills and action, and it delivers in that aspect, because I was quite entertained.Milla Jovovich appears to be the new action heroine (like Kate Beckinsale and Angelia Jolie), but she's more underrated. She needs a film that both audiences and critics will hail as superior, and she'll finally receive the recognition she deserves.",6,1,2,18 July 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," My Review
","No matter how many times I watch this spectacular film, I cannot understand a lot of it (such as the importance of the black pillar).Still, it is a piece of cinematic genius, and one of the best films ever created. Kubrick was definitely a visionary and there's very few men like him in the world today.Beginning with the Dawn of Man and going to space travel, '2001' is one of the best science fiction movies ever made.'2001' also gave us one of cinema's greatest villains: HAL. A self-aware computer that is programming a manned trip to Jupiter. It is cold, calculating and without remorse. It's always right, and mankind is the error. It's also a possible glimpse into our own future as we begin to create self-aware robots, hoping they won't turn into HALs.The effects, the score, the scenes and everything about this film is just spectacular.",10,1,3,26 July 2008
A Clockwork Orange," My Review
","'A Clockwork Orange' is about young rebellious Alex and his gang of thugs who go around and terrorize the town. He is apprehended and subjected to a 'test procedure' that will cure him of his animal instincts.Now cured, Alex is released to a society that he once degraded, and who now degrades him. He cannot fight back because of the procedure that was done to him, and it serves as poetic justice to a person who caused so much damage.This movie is critically acclaimed and with good reason. Stanley Kubrick was one of the best directors of our time, and he delivered a top-notch sci-fi movie that's also filled with his political and social undertones (such as the 'morals' of society and how by eliminating the animal urges people have can make them a perfect person). McDowell did a fantastic job, and overall the film is exceptional (the music, the scenery, the acting...everything). Kubrick definitely delivered a classic in 'Clockwork Orange.'",10,1,3,20 July 2008
Hancock," My Review
","John Hancock (Will Smith) is a superhero with a complex: he hates everyone. He suffers from amnesia, and can't remember parts of his life. He drinks and he's not the best example of a superhero. Then comes executive Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), whose life is saved by Hancock, and he vows to help Hancock turn into a reputable person of society. His wife, Mary (Charlize Theron) seems to have a connection with Hancock as well.As Hancock turns a new leaf and becomes a superhero people can count on, a shocking revelation sends Hancock's life into a tailspin as he learns who he truly was, and is, and his connections with people that seem random but really aren't.This wasn't the best superhero movie to date, but it wasn't the worst. The storyline was compelling although not enough time was given to fully maximize the potential of it. Will Smith, as always, did a fantastic job, but the whole film seemed choppy and out of focus with the overall theme. Nonetheless, it was still a decent action flick.",7,1,3,20 November 2008
WALL·E," My Review
","Years in the future, Earth is a desolate wasteland. No one is around - except for Wall-E, a robot designed to make cubes out of trash. His only friend is a cockroach, until one day a spaceship comes, and EVE appears. EVE is another robot sent to Earth to find signs of life. She and Wall-E connect, and soon Wall-E is taken aboard the ship and must save mankind from itself.I don't think this is a good film for children, because there's a lot of 'downtime' in it (not a lot of dialogue or action). However, I think it is Pixar's best film to date. Wall-E is just so cute and curious, which leads to hilarious consequences. And his relationship with EVE is something of classic cinema, bringing back the age-old courtship and slow romance. And MO is absolutely hilarious. I was laughing so hard I could hardly breathe. Truly one of the best films of the year.",10,0,2,13 November 2008
Never Back Down," My Review
","Young, rebellious Jake Tyler (Sean Farris) and his mother and younger brother move from Iowa (or Idaho, can't remember) to Orlando so his brother can get a start in the competitive world of tennis.The first day he draws attention from the most popular girl, Baja (Amber Heard), and a d-bag of her boyfriend Ryan (Cam Gigandet), who apparently rules the school with iron fists of fury.Jake quickly befriends Max (Evan Peters), who introduces him to the world of MMA (Mixed Martial Arts). Baja invites Jake to a party, where Jake is cornered by Ryan and forced to fight after Ryan insulted his father (whom passed away in a car accident that Jake holds himself responsible for). Jake gets the crap kicked out of him, and his ego is just as bruised as his body, and plans retaliation.Max brings him to his trainer, Jean (Djimon Hounsou), who begins to work with Jake not just physically but mentally as well, helping him focus his pent up anger towards something more useful.All of which leads to a final showdown between Jake and Ryan...I wonder who is going to win? Alright, I will be sarcastic a bit and say that the ending is none too surprising. It's a typical fight movie, but this one you really don't have someone to root for. Sure, you can support Jake, but he's pretty much a complete d-bag throughout 95% of the film, and the final small bit of the film where he suddenly becomes the un-caped crusader of the poor just doesn't make you want to root for him.However, I will say that I found the film quite enjoyable, despite being two hours long, it didn't feel like it. And I felt that it was a complete movie, and it wasn't really lacking in anything. It wasn't the movie's fault that it had a predictable ending, 95% of sports movies have that required ending. Don't hold the ending against an otherwise practically flawless movie.",7,2,3,23 July 2008
Iron Man," My Review
","Millionaire playboy Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) travels to Afghanistan to showcase his new weapons inventions to the army. While there, he's taken captive (thanks to his own weaponry) and imprisoned for three months. During that time he invents a suit of armor that's also heavy on the artillery, and manages to escape his captors.Back home, he and his secretary Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) work on changing the Stark name - by eliminating all weapons from the program. This infuriates Stark's right hand man Obadiah (Jeff Bridges) as well as Stark's good friend Rhodey (Terrence Howard). Obadiah is soon revealed to be the bad guy in the film, and gets his hands on Stark's original suit design. This leads to a major battle between Iron Man and the Iron Monger.Once again, Marvel delivers a spectacular superhero movie (we'll just ignore 'Elektra' and 'Hulk' ever existed). Downey Jr. returns in a major way, delivering Tony Stark with dry humor, wit, intelligence, and even some heart. From beginning to end, 'Iron Man' is a marvel of a film, and shouldn't be missed.",9,1,2,25 September 2008
