The Blair Witch Project," worst horror film i ve ever seen
","after i had watched this film i was in a state of total shock. 2 dollars rent i wasted on this film. this isn't even a film its just totally pitiful.this is the worst horror film i have ever seen and i have seen most of them.no gore,no suspense,no plot and terrible camera work.similar to cannibal holocaust except that c.h. was gory,original and thrilling.deodato invented the shaky camera and these amateurs have soiled his cinematic trick for life. just to make this clear:i don't hate this film because its low budget.i think most low budget horror movies are the best because they keep a level of independence and don't care about ratings etc. but this is just bad. don't watch!",2,1,3,11 August 2005
