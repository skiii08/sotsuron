Walk the Line," This one's got it all!!!
","Watching this film I could not help but think of what I call the three most compelling themes in telling a story. First, there's the story of a person realizing their dream (the humbler their beginnings and the stronger the odds against them, the more powerful the effect), second, the story of redemption (the farther they fall and the farther they make it back, the more compelling their return) and lastly the story of a love that finally succeeds (particularly one where the odds seem stacked against them). Most good movies are lucky if they successfully cover just one of these themes and even fewer manage two, so when I tell you this movie has all three, well you may disagree, but that's my opinion and I'm sticking to it! I have read many reviews comparing this film to Ray, but the one which I thought of after seeing it is Hustle and Flow, which I believe also contains these three themes, although to a greater or lesser degree in certain areas.I think Mangold brilliantly uses the close-up to incredible effect in telling this story, particularly the 2-shots during Cash and Carter's duets. They lent a real intimacy to these scenes and made me truly feel not only the love between these two people, but also a genuine caring and friendship.I am amazed to find that although I was never a real Johnny Cash fan, I have become a huge Joaquin Phoenix/Johnny Cash fan. While Phoenix has received praise for his performance from every corner, I feel Ms. Witherspoon deserves every bit as much, if not more, recognition for her wonderful turn as June Carter Cash. To be able to act like that, to look like that and on top of it all, sing like that, is truly an embarrassment of riches. If she is overlooked at Oscar time, I will be sorely disappointed.I've seen it twice now. Please make sure you see it at least once. You will not be disappointed.",10,0,2,2 December 2005
