Requiem for a Dream," I don't even know what to say
","Everyone should see it, thats a start...But I don't know if I can say it was good. It was marvelously created, and I can think of NO movie that has impressed an emotion (or a whole flock of them) as strongly as this film. Innovative direction and truly spectacular acting makes these characters come to life and feel uncomfortably human and in too many ways, not dissimilar from myself. The storyline is also very original and particularly suitable for depicting the kind of misery the author and director were so obviously aiming for.It even motivated me to get off my ass and do some community service. But it just made me feel so entirely depressed and sick by the end of it, that I can't say I enjoyed watching it. But wow what a film.",Null,0,1,26 September 2005
