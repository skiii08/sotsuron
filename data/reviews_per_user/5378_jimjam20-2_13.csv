The Devil's Advocate," I 'used' to like it
","I loved this movie when I first saw it, but on further viewings...its not worth much. Al Pacino is great as the devil (my fav devil) but Keanu is just sorta there. Jeffery Jones has a small role, and is good as usuall. Also Craig T. Nelson of Coach fame is in there.  It's to long and really slows down after awhile.",Null,0,1,21 January 2002
As Good as It Gets," Its just another romantic comedy people!
","WAY over rated romantic comedy seemed to be elevated to status of best picture nominee because it has Jack Nicholson. Just having Jack in it does NOT make it good. Although features some fun supporting work, Nicholson is pretty much playing his typical a**hole jerk he plays in almost every movie. Doing the same character over & over is not really acting, its just recylcing an old performance. Don't bother.",5,1,4,25 January 2002
Amistad," Just because its Spielberg..dosen't make it good
","Historical drama is a painful bore that seems to go on and on. Theres some really solid actiing in this one, its hurt by an over long running time.  It brings up the question, just cuz its done by a world class director about true events, Is that automatic reason to praise it? I think not.",Null,0,2,25 January 2002
The Fifth Element," was better 5 years ago...
","Although I still like this movie, since I saw it my senior year with my buddies, it just dosen't hold up today. Bruce Willis plays his typical every-man out to save the world. Gary Oldman is sort of a joke with his over the top southern accent. Chris Tucker is just annoying in what ever he is in.  A few highlights mixed into the clutter, but over all...is just a mindless sci-fi-comedy-action flick. If you like those sort of movies, you will prolly love this.",Null,2,3,17 January 2002
Spice World," Truly horrible
","God Awful movie bout the once rising pop group who truly turned out to be a flash in the pan group. With some of the boy band losers & little teeny queens out there trying to become actors now adays, they should take alook at this farce, showing just cuz your pretty & popular dosen't make you any good. Just Brutal.",Null,1,2,25 January 2002
Face_Off," Wild action
","One of the better action movies out there to be sure.  Travolta & Cage are great in the dueling roles as the leads. Both are at there bests when getting to play Castor, thats for sure. With some of the terrible action movies out there latley, this is truly something speical as far as action goes.  The End boat chase is kinda overkill, but its a fun ride anyway.",Null,0,1,17 January 2002
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Just awful
","If you liked the first one (which I didn't care for) you might like this farce, but I thought it was just a loud crappy sequel to an overrated blockbuster.  Jeff Goldblum is back for this one, but he can't save it from being just rehashed scenes of dinosaurs running amuck. It was crap, plain & simple. (and from what I heard, the 3rd one was even worse!)",Null,0,0,17 January 2002
The Game," Keeps you on the edge
","Very good, dark & suspenful thriller has a great effort from Michael Douglas in the lead, and will keep you guessing from scene to scene.  Truly worth seeing, but I doubt I could watch it again (all the surprises are gone) Highly Recommended.",7,0,1,17 January 2002
Men in Black," Fun Sci-fi
","This is a pretty good mix of sci-fi & comedy.  Smith is funny & is a perfect match with the silent type Jones. The effects are cool, but its the actors who shine.  Its not anything that stands out as a classic, but its a fun movie, and you need one of those once in awhile.",Null,0,0,17 January 2002
Titanic," Best Picture of 1997..whatever
","Although this is a good movie, I would so not mark it as the best picture of the year. Decent acting & a running time that does not feel like 3.5 hours. Dicaprio as the lead is ok, but don't look for him to ever have another monster hit, he has peaked with this one. The funny thing about this movie, is that alot of the people who praised it at first have pretty much forgotten about it. Good, but no where near great.",Null,0,2,25 January 2002
Scream 2," Not quite as good as the first, but then..that one sucked too
","I never really saw what the big deal behind the first one was, and this weak sequel us a waste of the actors time. A mocking off the slasher genre they are making here just comes across as stupid rather than funny.  Jamie Kennedy as the movie nut is one of the sole bright spots, but he is certanley not enough to keep this one afloat. If you want to watch a good slasher movie, rent My Bloody Valentine.",Null,0,0,25 January 2002
Con Air," Absolutly does not hold up
","I Loved this movie in 97 (I think the only movie I have ever seen in the theater twice in the same day) but the stupid one liners, Cages crappy southern accent, and dumb situations make this one stupier with each viewing.  Cage feels more like Forrest Gump, Army Ranger with the accent. Totally mindless entertainment.",Null,1,2,17 January 2002
Jackie Brown," Overrated
","I never saw what the big deal about this one is. Some good actors, but just them in it don't make it a must see. I always thought Pulp Fiction was a little over hyped & reviewed, but is far better than this one. If you are a hardcore Tarantino mark, its a must see for you. But its not worth seeing, Not as mind blowingly great as people would have you believe",Null,3,5,25 January 2002
