Walk the Line," Truly a film in its own league!
","I felt involved watching this film. It had it all a complicated romance, genius music and a very strong narrative . An amazing performance from Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix there singing was unexpectedly really good in fact i bought the soundtrack today and cant stop listening to it.The camera work and sound made the film for me. The costume and generally all the mise-en-scene was done exceptionally well. Locations were very inviting and drawn me into every scene. The cast were spot on i could'nt have thought of anyone better to play Johnny cash and June Carter.Go see it! Saiman",10,0,0,16 March 2006
