3:10 to Yuma," Good acting for a relatively stupid screenplay
","I am not sure where this hype comes from for this movie. My wife and I watched this together, and both of us were asking several questions during the movie: Why do they not shoot the gang members while they are standing plainly outside? Why does Ben Wade decide on running all the way to the train? Is it because he wants to help Dan look good in his son's eye? Why does he slaughter his gang? Anyways, acting is very good. That's worth 2 stars i guess. I haven't watched the original, so I am not clear whether they had all these stupid events to be faithful to the original, but either way, I found the movie as realistic and convincing as a power rangers episode.",2,8,13,24 January 2009
