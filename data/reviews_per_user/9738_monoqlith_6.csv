Requiem for a Dream," Darren Aronofsky's Brilliance - A Review
","Darren Aronofsky's latest effort, Requiem for a Dream, portrays a descent into the depths of chemical dependency.  The film begins its crescendo of tension with the heisting of Sarah Goldfarb's(Ellen Burstyn) television set by her son Harry(Jared Leto) and his comrade Tyrone(Marlon Wayans) to fund their experimentation with drugs. This experimentation soon escalates to drug-pushing, an enterprise innately prone to failure, and then culminates with the ensemble's full-blown terminal addiction. All the while, parallels are drawn between the story of Harry, Marrian(his girlfriend, played by beautiful Jenniffer Connoly), Tyrone, and Harry's mother as they all waste away in their various terminal addictions. Jennifer resorts to de-facto prostitution to finance Harry's and Tyrone's drug entrepeneurship, while Harry's arm succumbs to the defilement of heroin addiction, as he and Tyrone desperately try to chase down more `pieces' upon which to fix themselves and grow their business. Perhaps the most intense and depressing story of them all is that of Harry's mother, Sarah, who finds herself in the midst of a loneliest inferno exaggerated by her physical addiction to weight-diet pills. In all its astounding surrealism, never once does Aronofsky surrender Â‘Requiem' to mindless shock-ridden chaos, the excesses of bad horror movies. Everything in the movie serves to further the film's overall coherence and intensity: the quick edits, the use of psychadelic color and twitching lights, the careful, meticulous, deliberate construction of shots. Aronofsky smoothly, but deliberately, switches between each person's perspective as the story rolls onward; and while the story is told in the third-person, its tone is wholly first-person. We are outside the mind of each victim, but the experience conveys the same percieved intensity of drug-addiction to someone who has never been addicted to drugs; in this, we are brought into the mind of the addict. Aronofsky's masterful direction and the film's editing give it a sense of being one inch away from reality: and in this, the film truly portrays the actuality of drug addiction. The actors themselves masterfully helped to heighten the experience: Burstyn's performance is extremely poignant at many points throughout, and as usual is worthy of a Best Actress award. Jared Leto and, unexpectedly, Marlon Wayans, shine in their roles along with beautiful Jennifer Connoly, who never once, even with the severely detrimental effects of heroin and cocaine, seems to lose her beautiful visage(perhaps a more frightening prospect than visible deterioration). If you've ever thought about trying cocaine or heroin, watch this movie. If you are already addicted to cocaine or heroin, watch this movie. I assure you, if it does not scare you out of drug abuse, if it does not rescue you from that cliff of devastation, then you are owed your money back. Overall, the movie accomplishes everything it aspires to accomplish, with flying colors. Darren Aronofsky is brilliant. See it. Overall Rating: 10/10",10,0,0,11 June 2001
Minority Report," Spielberg just can't gratify morons!
","People who quibble about plotholes seem to miss the point entirely.  But it is sadness knowing that people will never cease to miss the point. Most never attempt to find one. So Spielberg needs to stop bending over backwards for commercial success. The high concept here is too sublime  to cheapen with mainstream action sequences, no matter how 'creative' they are. It is also beautiful filmmaking, not gaudy or excessive like George Lucas' recent travesties.  Spielberg's future is not superfluous eye-candy but an essential part of the work. He assumes his environment exists, and so it does. No heavy-handed pans or long shots besides those which are relevant. So Spielberg creates atmosphere as well as he always does - in AI, Schindler's List, E.T. All these movies have palpable atmosphere, ripe with both emotion and intellect. And SS disowns the notion of consistent future, opting instead for the likely medium between what is and what will be.  Like AI, his setting changes with the plotline - the plotline doesn't work around the setting. No foresaking the practice of allusion with excess - all allusions in this movie are loaded, literary-like, with relevance. Although I don't like the Matrix fanfare(the sound effect - horns and spiders crawling up the stairs?) Thematically this movie is somewhere between a Comedy and a Tragedy. I just hope that Tom Cruise's late line, vaguely remembered as 'You know your own future which means you can change it,' is meant to be taken with a grain of salt. But the resultant philosophical can of worms is too big to open right now. Regardless, I love this movie. See it. 9.5/10(here, 9/10)",9,0,0,22 June 2002
The Big Lebowski," Brilliant Comedy on par with Annie Hall and Dr. Strangelove
","*WARNING minor spoilers* The Big Lebowski, virtually ignored by the mainstream and a relative commercial failure, is the Coen Brother's most hilariously clever comedy to date. The film combines the best of slapstick, hilarious dialogue, extremely well-drawn and complex characters, an excellent plot, and social commentary of the highest calibur to create perhaps the best comedy of all time. Jeff Bridges is absolutely brilliantly lazy in his quasi-passive burnt-out character, while John Goodman provides perhaps one of the most impressive performances as a shafted disgruntled reactionary ''Nam' veteran. John Turturro provides the most immediately up-front hilarious character as a bowling 'paedharass', Jesus Quintana: 'That's right, Nobody f***s with the Jesus!' I've watched this movie four or five times to date, and have yet to grow wary of the virtual infinity of perfectly repeatable lines. And if you are offended by incessant swearing, well, all I can say is: 'You are entering a world of pain.'",10,0,1,17 July 2001
Fight Club," Don't Fret About Plot 'Holes'
","Fight Club is a genuinely entertaining and excellently produced flick. Why fret about Plot Holes? I see that many of the reviewers here lack the ability of the suspension of disbelief. This movie most certainly requires a certain suspension of all disbelief and inane, pretentious skepticism. The movie itself does not say something momentus or particularly original about the decadence of shallow American society. In this regard it is a lot like 'The Matrix' - attempting to say something profound about our world while still captivating those short attention span high velocity flick-loving American audiences. Granted both Fight Club and the Matrix accomplish this wonderfully. But also granted, both Fight Club and the Matrix textually say things about society and reality that are at best skin deep, akin to a particularly ambitious article pondering a mainstreamed existence you would find in say 'Seventeen Magazine.' But, don't let that bother you. Fight Club is well made for what it attempts, much better than The Matrix, I think. Don't miss it! 9/10.",9,0,1,24 June 2001
American Beauty," Very good film
","*WARNING MINOR SPOILERS* It seems that those who didn't like this film either belong to the same middle-class complacent stereotype as Lester Burnham and his family, are complete outsiders, or take too much from the scenes overflowing with teenage angst. Yes, these characters are stereotypical. The film does NOT pretend otherwise. In fact, they are the archetypical versions of their stereotypes! This exaggeration, however, merely serves to further the film's ultimate message and purpose! Didn't Dickens employ the use of archetypical character portraits for most of his serials, as well? Didn't this, too, help broaden the scope of his views, and lend to thousands of English readers an idea of the poverty of the working class? Well, the same exact goes for American Beauty, which paints the American middle-class lifestyle for what it is: a materialistic enterprise and empty ideal, replacing for its followers a longed-for sense of happiness with petty materialism and hopeless monetary fulfillment. THe film's characters are the idea, the American dream of hope and life which eventually, inevitably, surrenders itself to stasis and inertia. That's why the characters are so stereotypical! THey *are* the dream! In fact, they are an extended version of the dream. Anette Bening's character sells the dream itself, in the form of suburban real estate, and in her failure(which suggests to her the unthinkable notion that what she does for a living provides only emptiness) aspires to be an even higher, more unattainable ideal: the real-estate 'king' who represents to her a synthetic notion of perfection and contentment, succcess. In fact, the man is an a**hole himself! As for the teenagers: yes, this is what middle-class teenagers are like! Believe me, I know. I am 17 years old. The contrived 'beauty' of the floating bag does not lend any insight to the next-door neighbor, but rather attests to the pretense of these ordinary things being considered beautiful. Lester's obsession with the ordinary, everyday luxuries, the marijuana, the finetuning of his physical being, the reattachment to some idea to which he attributes 'happiness,' also seems empty and unfulfilling, ultimately leading to death(which is why the perpetrator is more or less tagged on as an afterthought: it doesn't matter!). This is the danger of creating the idea and fixing your reality to inertly reflect it. It is not real! Happiness is a completely internal phenomenon, achievable only by some direct realization of the self, not some contrived 'idea' of the self as presented in such novels as 'The Great Gatsby.' This is the message of the film! Thank you. Have a nice day!",8,0,0,13 July 2001
Pearl Harbor," Worst film of the decade, and I do mean the decade 2001-2010
","Yes. That's right. I'll be stunned if someone other than Michael Bay, in the next 9 1/2 years, creates a more grossly unbelievable, cliched, distorted, mutilitated, butchered piece of...well, you get the idea. Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer(sp?) have succeeded at one thing: they have trivialized perhaps the most important pereptia of the century. They have surrendered millions of dollars to create the most racially stereotypical, the most irrevocably inaccurate, the most disgusting biased piece of trash I have yet to spend $8.50 on. What saddens me more than having seen this, this, this sacrilege, is to see that this film(if you can call it that) has garnered a vote higher than 3.0 on IMDB. I just do not understand how movies of this undeniably horrid level of quality can be made anymore in America. We haven't evolved a bit, have we? In times like this, the stupidity of the American public really comes to light. And if you can't resist the hype, if you can't possibly stop yourself from seeing Pearl Harbor, remind yourself repeatedly through the film: this is NOT what film-making is! This is NOT art! This is capitalism. This is commercialism. This is Hollywood.",1,0,0,22 June 2001
