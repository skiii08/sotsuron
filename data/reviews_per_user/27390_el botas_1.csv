Scarface," Manolo, choot dat piece o' chit.
","Scarface.  This movie is nothing short of a masterpiece.  Scarface is one of the few (if not the only movie) movies I've seen in which every member of the cast just simply excels in his/her respective role.A lot of people complain about the length of this movie (2 hrs. 50 min.) and/ or the violence.  Apparently these people failed to understand that these elements are essential to one of the major themes of the movie: EXTREMISM, a cornerstone of the over-indulgent 80's during which this masterpiece was made.Even if you saw this movie and for some reason did not like it, no one who knows anything about acting, film, or anything else for that matter, can deny the supremacy of Pacino's acting in Scarface.I could sit here writing until the next millennium about this movie, but just see the movie if you haven't already done so, and you will know that the old saying, 'A word to the wise is sufficient,' rings home with a vengeance:  SCARFACE.",Null,0,0,22 September 2000
