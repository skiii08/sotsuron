The Blair Witch Project," An excellent film
","An excellent film which I thought was good the first time watching and awesome the second time. Great cast! The second time I watched it, some new experiences came up, like when they find the bloody rag and also just before the movie ended in the house. I recommend everybody to go rent (or better yet - buy) this movie as it's about to become a classic in the horror genre.",10,1,2,1 April 2000
Coyote Ugly," One of the best...
","One of the best films of all times. If you think 'Time of your life' was good, now try this. This is absolutely one of the best motion pictures I've ever seen; it's plain and down-to-earth, just the way you want it. I give it at 10/10! Nice drama from a girl half as old as I am.....",10,1,2,5 May 2001
