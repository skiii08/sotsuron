Iron Man 3," Such a letdown
","First off, I'd like to talk about what I liked about the film. Happy Hogan. For me, he was the best thing in the whole film. Genuinely funny and someone I cared about. Robert Downey Jr. delivers another great performance. In fact, none of the performances is really bad. They all do a really good job. The opening song 'I'm Blue' was a great throwback to the 90s. Loved it.My problem lies with the story and how it's handled. First of all, The Mandarin is Ironman's arch nemesis. He is the Joker to Ironman's Batman. How they could totally and completely f*%k that up is beyond me. Mardarin is an epic villain and should've been firmly based around his comicbook counterpart. But no. What we got is some lame generic villain who was no better than that turd from Ironman 2, and who did not at all even in the slightest resemble the true Mandarin. I supposed it wouldn't have been quite so bad if they had just left 'The Mandarin' name out of the film altogether, but as is, they totally flushed Ironman's greatest foe down the toilet like some piece of garbage. In Ironman 1, 2, and Avengers, Tony's suits are all extremely solid and stand up to tough damage well. Hell, even the God of Thunder bashes the suit with some pretty good shots, but it stayed together and held up nicely. In this disastrous wreck though, pretty much any time Tony's suit gets hit, it falls apart. Just a f*&king disgrace. All in all, I hated this film and never want to see it again. Ironman 2 is still Marvel Studios' worst film to date, but Ironman 3 is right behind it. It sucks. It's terrible. It's boring. It's a slap in the face to the other films that came before it. What a way to wreck an amazing villain and a great character. Marvel should be ashamed of themselves. I hope to God the rest of Phase 2 gets better from here on out and the worst is behind us. I don't think I can handle another monumental bastardisation like what I witnessed with Ironman 3.",1,5,12,15 May 2013
Rocky IV," Rocky IV is among the greatest action films ever made!
","What can I say... This is the best Rocky film there is. Albeit not quite as deep or character driven as the others, it more than makes up for it in the action department. When I first saw Rocky IV, I was 100% blown away at how amazingly awesome it was! Everything from the montages, to the landscape, to the fight scene, to Rocky, to Ivan Drago himself... all wreaks of total awesomeness! DO NOT MISS this classic edition to the Rocky franchise! One cool little tid-bit you all should know.... Rocky IV is the highest grossing sports movie of all-time World Wide, having made a whopping $300+ MILLION at the Box Office.This film also has got to be one of the most inspirational films I have ever seen! Never before have I wanted to get outside and run or workout like I do after watch this movie! I think you will too.Ivan Drago is the man! Best Rocky villain, by far! Not even the brutal CLubber Lang can match the awesomeness of Ivan Drago!",10,3,5,10 May 2010
