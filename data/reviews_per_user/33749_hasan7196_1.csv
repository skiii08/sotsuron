Scarface," overall greatness
","the film has a balanced beginning, middle and end. the scenes just go into one another perfectly. the action in this movie is just spectacular, it will keep you glued scene after scene. overall i think this film is best for the ages of 13 to 25 although the film is only for 18 and over. overall the film is very cool. there are no boring scenes whatsoever. one of the best gangster type movies to be ever made and I'm not just saying this from a rappers point of view. if you have not watched it yet, 'WHERE WERE YOU IN THE 90'S!!' *the paragraph in between the stars have nothing to do with the film. I'm just writing it as IMDb says that i have to write at least 10 lines so i am trying to make 10 lines by writing nonsense so that IMDb will let me post this review as they will not let me unless there are 10 lines written from me.*",10,0,1,5 September 2006
