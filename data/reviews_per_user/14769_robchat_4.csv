Skyfall," how many times can you re-invent Bond and get away with it?
","READ THIS AFTER YOU HAVE WATCHED THE FILM TO COMPARE OPINIONS As a huge James Bond fan, this is what I think ...In a nutshell.The first two halves/acts are great (and are definitely James Bond) The intro has a very exciting spy feel, Bonds resurrection and the bad guy being such a good actor (and hitting on Bond - loved that) all work excellently.My first small criticism is what was the point of the Bond girl. He shags her and then she dies. He could have at least saved her life.Then everything is fine and tense again. In the cell like Hannibal Lector. Liked that too.Bad guy escapes and there is more tense action - all good all good.Second small criticism is the tube train crash. Over the top - that's fine, but why is there no one in the train. I hate that! It's like The A-Team. No one dies :p Then there is a tense shoot out in the court (which is also good) I like the poetry. I liked the themes of old and new running through it ... all so good.BUT WAIT ...now I'm starting to get confused.UP TO THIS POINT WE HAVE A FANTASTIC BOND FILM !!!! ...But then a couple of things happened: First - we find out that the master plan of the bad guy was to infiltrate MI6 so that he could locate M and set up a scenario so that he could walk into a court and shoot her. Hmm. That was his masterplan? Bond has broken into M's house twice now. Why didn't the bad guy just break into her house and kill her? OK. Maybe he wanted to punish MI6 and kill M publicly, but still, his masterplan was a bit rubbish. And in the end he just goes to the countryside to kill her in the middle of nowhere anyway.Second - the third act ... = the big question mark. Do I like it or not? It's not Bond. You are right! Bond takes Sean Connery's car and drives M back home to Scotland for some MacGyver action. Random old Scottish bloke still hanging around and big shoot out. It was OK, but just OK. Not much spy stuff, not very Bond at all, and I just didn't feel the sadness when M died. I was a little surprised ..(as a side note, I also know the history of M's relationship to Bond. In The World is Not Enough. She trusts him. In Die Another Day she doesn't give a crap about him. Then Casino Royale and the re-boot. She doesn't trust him. Quantum of Solace .. doesn't mind if he gets killed but starting to trust him. In Skyfall they are best mates!)This would have worked better with a James Bond adventure between Quantum and Skyfall to establish this relationship. And that's the problem I had. I want a proper Bond adventure! We all want a proper Bond adventure! Stop reinventing yourself in every film!! Let me explain ..... the final scene. Now I did like the idea of killing M, introducing Q and gadgets, bringing back Moneypenny and finishing the film with modern Bond in the situation of the original old Bond. I thought that was a really nice idea and it worked well.BUT although I like it, I think that the Daniel Craig Bond's have been a bit lost ...Casino Royale - FANTASTIC (one of the best action films ever along with Dark Knight). At the end, we have our new James Bond ready for Bond adventures.Quantum of Solace - oh no wait. This is part two of Casino Royale. Bond is not Bond yet. First he needs to find his zen and then he is Bond. Forgive this odd Casino Royale add-on. At the end - Bond is ready. Yeh!Skyfall - Bond is Bond look! Yipeee. Oh no wait. He was Bond for the intro ... but now he has apparently been Bond too long and he's done in. When did that happen? It seems he needs to learn some more and go through some more ... and now at the end of this film he is ready to be Bond.Basically, I liked Skyfall a lot but what was missing was some normal Bond adventures between Casino Royale/Quantum of Solace story arch and this one. If they could have squeezed at least one James Bond adventure in between then Skyfall would have made more sense and worked better for me.I don't need to see Bond becoming Bond in every film! He was already Bond before Daniel Craig came along! So now I am ready for Daniel Craig to be Bond.In Skyfall Bond was all knackered and out of shape and lost his will to be a spy which was all good, but he hasn't done anything yet! We are just supposed to assume that in between Casino Royale/Quantum of Solace and Skyfall he has been doing lots of Bond stuff so that M and he have had time to develop a very close relationship.Again, all good ideas but we wanted to see some of that first! Anyway, the ending is good and I hope now that they just give us some straight forward Bond adventures with clever story lines instead of trying to develop the new Bond every time.That's what I think :-)",7,3,6,14 February 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Bruce Wayne Rises
","There has been disappointment for me this summer. The Avengers was early on and a very very enjoyable film, but Prometheus with a high rating on IMDb was a flawed let down, and the new Spiderman was pointless. I had hoped for more this summer and I hope Bourne Legacy is half decent.I wasn't going to watch The Dark Knight Rises. I wasn't impressed with the trailer and the previous film, The Dark Knight, was so much to live up to.I still have a friend who hasn't seen The Dark Knight. I keep telling him to watch it, and he asks 'Is it really that good?', and I keep replying 'Yes! It is amazing!' But then I saw on IMDb that The Dark Knight Rises has (at time of writing) a rating of 8.9 so I thought. 'I must be wrong. This film must be amazing too!' Like Prometheus, I think some people went to the movie so hyped from the idea of the film that they over-rated it.This film is a nice end to the Nolan trilogy. Nothing more.It is not about Batman. Batman is physically done in after his encounter with the Joker and Batman isn't much of a Batman any more. That explains the lack of Batman acrobatics, but it doesn't explain the lack of interesting action sequences in this film. Even the opening plane sequence didn't do much for me.This film is all about Bruce Wayne, not Batman. It should be called 'Bruce Wayne Rises'. The most interesting aspect of this film for me was that it was more about the characters that were already established in the previous two movies, and what happens to them in the end.Anne Hathaway does a very good job as a believable Catwoman. Bane on the other hand is menacing but characterless. By the end of the film everything interesting about Bane has been taken away.It was nice to see how they brought in the stories from the previous two films in order to tie up the trilogy, but unfortunately the story had nothing spectacular about it. It was just a good yarn.I didn't get bored and it was enjoyable to watch (like Prometheus), but also like Prometheus, after I watched the film, I saw some unforgivable plot holes. One being when Bane takes Bruce to a prison far away, and then Bruce comes back, despite the main plot point being that Gotham is blockaded so that no one can get in or out.What is the point of the blood sequence at the beginning in the plane too? It served no purpose that I could see. Was it just to make us cringe a bit? If it wasn't for the high rating on IMDb, I wouldn't have watched this film until it came out on DVD, and that would have been the better choice. It doesn't need to be seen on the big screen.The ending was the most interesting. There has been a lot of discussion about whether or not the ending was a dream sequence or not. Is it just wishful thinking from Alfred and Commissioner Gordon or not? In my opinion, the ending is supposed to be open to interpretation. It is not supposed to be clear.A lot of people seem to have missed the point of the final moment in the film when Robin is introduced too. This is not the beginning of Robin because Robin already is Robin. This is about who will take over from Batman because Batman can be anyone. As the floor rises, the film title appears - The Dark Knight Rises.It seems the ending has not only created discussion but also some confusion. I am all for films that make you think, but all in all I think I would probably have preferred if the dream sequence wasn't used to create a potential 'happy end' and the film hadn't been left open for a sequel. Though these are minor points.The major problem with this film is that it is not 'amazing'. It is just 'good', and we expected more from the man who brought us Memento, Inception and The Dark Knight.I give The Dark Knight 9.5 out of 10I give The Dark Knight Rises 7.5 out of 10",7,4,8,8 August 2012
Spectre," Daniel Craig's first real Bond adventure! - but is it his last?
","Sean Connery was the original cinematic Bond of the 60s - suave, dangerous, charming, sexy, sexist and sarcastic, Roger Moore brought us the tongue-in-cheek laugh-out-loud Bond, and George Lazenby tied those two together with an epic cheeky yet emotional and sad portrayal of Bond. In the 80s, Timothy Dalton's serious and more ruthless Bond was the most literary accurate, and then came Pierce Brosnan in the 90s with a version of Bond that managed to incorporate aspects of all of these.But in 2002, they ruined Bond. Die Another Day was a soul- destroyingly ridiculous affair with bad CGI instead of stunts, an invisible car that took Bond purely into fantasy, and an inexplicable script in which everyone was suddenly hurtling pitiful sarcastic remarks at each other for no apparent reason. I felt the way other adults feel when they cry hopelessly because their favourite football team just lost the championship - devastated.So I decided to finally read the books and concluded that they had gone so far on a tangent that what they needed to do to save Bond from this mess was to remake all the films, but this time in the correct order and faithful to the books.Then to my utter surprise, they acquired the rights to the first book, Casino Royale, and decided to do a reboot. Wow. My enthusiasm returned!Casino Royale turned out to be one of the best spy thrillers ever made. It incorporated everything that makes a 007 film and respectfully turned it on its head. The gadget is a mobile; the big enemy base is a big plane; Bond is not interested in the women or the vodka martini. The second half of the film is the book. He falls in love and loses the girl through betrayal, shaping Bond into the 007 we know - a killing machine with a fragile heart. When Casino Royale finishes, James Bond is ready for his first adventure as the new 007 - or so we think.Because it turns out in Quantum of Solace that the new Bond first needs more self-discovery to become the Bond we know and love. The excellent political backstory of this film is sadly lost in this short, unnecessary Bond outing, with atrocious editing and virtually none of the elements that actually make a Bond film. How could they mess it up twice in the space of three films? Next came Skyfall. Excellent marketing strategies made this next film the highest- grossing in Bond history, but was it really that amazing?In Skyfall, M has developed into a mother figure and Bond has been the 007 super-spy for so long that he is feeling weathered. But when did that happen!? We are once again left with another character development story setting up Bond. Only this time, our new Bond needs to become more of the old Bond again! Don't get me wrong. Skyfall director, Sam Mendes, presented us with one of the most beautiful James Bond films ever made with gorgeous colours, set pieces, elegant action sequences, and a wonderful script with a wonderful villain played by Javier Bardem. But the motif throughout the film is that we need the new Bond without moving so far away from what made 007 so good in the past. The film finishes with our modern-day Bond reintroduced into the traditional Bond set up.I came to Spectre with only one hope. Having not read any of the script leaks or controversy surrounding production (until after seeing the film), I just wanted a real Bond adventure!And I am glad to say - Spectre delivers just that!Spectre is the first film in which Craig carries on the torch of the previous Bonds once again. Just like Pierce, his Bond now incorporates the danger and charm of Sean, laugh-out-loud humour and light relief of Roger, care and compassion of George, seriousness of Timothy, but also remaining the likable modern-day maladjusted killing machine that we have come to know as Craig's Bond.The film itself has all the traditional Bond elements. The gun barrel intro, the secret base, the gadgets, the car, the henchman, the girl he must protect (and not let die!), and for the longstanding Bond fans out there, the film takes us to wonderful moments in Bond history.The plot in Spectre is no better than Silva's ridiculously convoluted plan in Skyfall to shoot M in public, but this is excusable to a certain extent in the Bond world because Bond villains are always completely insane. Spectre is a wonderful James Bond film. They did something new and incredible with Casino Royale, but they couldn't sustain it, so instead they gave us old Bond in a new world.My only criticism is that Christoph Waltz is totally underused! There is no momentous speech as with Silva in Skyfall. All of Christoph Waltz's scenes are rushed, lacking and thin. Hopefully, this will not matter though because Waltz could return ... or could he? They may have shot themselves in the foot again in this film by ending it the way they did. The film creates closure. A happy end for Craig's Bond. But what now?I came away loving this new Bond film! But with no feeling of conviction that they know now what they are doing with Bond today. Is Craig done? Is his first real Bond adventure his last?As a James Bond adventure harking back to pre-Casino Royale, this is one of the best in the series, and let's hope Daniel Craig decides to give us a few more! For we know that 'Bond Will Return'. But in what way is no longer certain.",9,11,32,28 October 2015
V for Vendetta," Unique, emotional and truly thought-provoking - this is a brave film
","V for Vendetta is a political thriller funded by Britain and Germany about a terrorist super hero - not your typical Hollywood blockbuster! It is based on the graphic novel of the same name and was written by The Matrix writers, The Wachowski Brothers.The film opens with Guy Fawkes attempting to blow up the Houses of Parliament on the 5th of November, 1605. This date, now known as Guy Fawkes Night, Bonfire Night or Fireworks Night, is celebrated every year in the United Kingdom when we have huge public bonfires on which a dummy or guy is set alight.Everybody in the UK knows the story of Guy Fawkes, but few people question why he would have wanted to do such a thing - this film does.It tells the story of a political idealist code-named V who has chosen freedom over oppression, seeking the complete reformation of the one-party fascist police state that is now England.Clearly a reference to Nazi-Germany, but also a reference to the post-9/11 world that we live in today, this film shows us a dystopian England which came about as a consequence of a war started by the USA , which left the US destitute, almost doing the same to its Coalition of the Willing, ie. England.But as the war is brought to London, Sutler, the extremely religious Undersecretary for Defence of the Conservative party (played by John Hurt), launches a secret project in the name of national security - the holocaustal mass experimentation on society's degenerates, namely homosexuals, ethnic minorities and religious minorities, in order to develop a virus that can be used as a weapon against alien threats.But instead, the virus is secretly used on Britain and Ireland, and when the public fear there is no more hope, Sutler comes forward with a vaccination. With the public now looking up to him to sort out the country, Sutler appoints himself the newly created position of high chancellor and the malign authoritarian state is formed under the new dictatorship named Norsefire.Already it can be seen that this film raises some serious and very relevant points; for example, whether or not a perceived outside threat justifies a diminution in civil liberties. In the UK today, the government is creating some quite oppressive laws, such as being able to detain suspected terrorists almost indefinitely without proof of guilt, in the name of making the country safer.I am not saying that this film portrays a realistic future; V for Vendetta clearly takes place in a fictional world with a comic book reality, but it is because this story's action packed story is so cleverly weaved into such a serious plot line that this Hollywood film is so brave.Stephen Fry's character, for example, is murdered because he owns a Koran, and the character V, played by Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith in The Matrix) is in fact the hero and the terrorist of the story! Believing that 'violence can be used for good', his vengeful and violent approach to justice taints his political idealism and leaves you disagreeing with and, at times, truly disliking the story's hero.V even tortures Natalie Portman's character, Evey, and uses the murder of her family to teach her not to fear death and be prepared to die for the coming revolution.The acting in this film is superb from all concerned, the action is big budget and yet the story is very intelligent. V for Vendetta is unique, emotional and truly thought-provoking.",10,1,4,6 October 2006
