The Hangover," A clich√® commercial for the dying city of Vegas
","I've read a lot of positive reviews on the Hangover but managed to get  only a few laughs while watching it. Not much of entertainment,  originality, surprise, and most importantly humour. At the end of it, I  was left with the suspicion that the whole thing was a badly made  commercial for the Vegas Blvd and having spent more than a month there,  I am telling you it is not worth it (unless you enjoy the cheap 'bling'  of the concrete hotels and plastic hookers).  What surprised me the most was the high score on IMDb (7,9 form roughly  120,000 users by the time I submit this review) that easily surpasses  my comedy favourite for 2009 - Funny People. C'mon IMDb, you are losing  it.  Honestly, you have to be of the intellectual capacity of Mike Tyson to  enjoy this one...",1,11,23,6 June 2010
