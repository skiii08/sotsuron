Antz," GREAT Animation work!
","This movie was fun to watch and figure out each insect's voice.  The story line was cute as well.  Though my wife and I do not like Woody Allen, his voice to the ant 'Z', was great.  The movie even had romantic interests in it as well.  It's a should see.... Not a MUST, but a should see!",Null,0,0,22 September 1999
