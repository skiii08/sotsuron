Howl's Moving Castle," disappointing ;(
","I was quite disappointed of this movie. After seeing all the other Ghiblis, this one had a very weak story. Sure, Neko no Ongaeshi was much worser, but it seemed like they just stole elements from earlier movies and built this movie from it. The main characters were OK, weaker than than the main characters in the earlier movies, but still very likable. But it just missed something new... ;( And the ending was the worst. Way to short for such a long movie. 'Hey, I'm a cursed prince...' lol. Well, I don't want to be too harsh, it had really good elements, but I expected much more of it. But that's my own fault. Never watch a movie with too high expectations... -__-",4,8,17,29 August 2005
