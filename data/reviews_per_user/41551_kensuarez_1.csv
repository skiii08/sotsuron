50 First Dates," A poorly-constructed formula comedy
","There's nothing wrong with a formula comedy. If well done, a formula comedy can be extremely satisfying even if we know what's coming (Eg. 'Seventeen Again'). However, this film's wooden, shallow employment of the standard devices of the genre left this viewer not only unsatisfied but seriously annoyed.First and foremost, the characters in such a film have to be likable enough to allow the audience to root for them. The Adam Sandler character was extremely unlikeable. Further, he wasn't redeemed or forgiven so much as his flaws were simply ignored. I found myself feeling sorry for Drew Barrymore's character, because she would be ending up with Adam Sandler's character. It would have been better if his character would have received some poetic justice in the end. Second, the construction of this type of comedy often requires the suspension of disbelief. The plot set-up in this movie made no sense whatsoever. There has to be SOME logic even in a fantasy.Third the use of comedic devices such as crazy side-kicks and periodic vulgarity were over-used and very very, poorly done in this film. Not one was worth a laugh.I don't think I'm over-analyzing this film. I have enjoyed a number of Adam Sandler films, and I usually like Drew Barrymore too, but this one was flat at best.
