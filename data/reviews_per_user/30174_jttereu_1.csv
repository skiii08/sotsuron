Iron Man 3," 'what the hell is this sh!t!!!!'
","of the iron man franchise this is the worse of the films, I watched this when it premiered here last Wednesday, questions that need to be answered, who wrote this? did marvel have any input at all or was all creative influence that of the director?... for a fan of the comics this movie will disappoint you heavily for a person with no knowledge on the ironman universe this film might interest you, i had high expectations for this film as the avengers was a mind blowing spectacle how ever im 3 fails in every area....it sucked the end.I really wished jon favreau had stayed on as producer rather then the brief cameo he makes as happy the driver/head of stark security.",2,16,32,30 April 2013
