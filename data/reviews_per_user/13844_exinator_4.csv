Source Code," Thank you Duncan Jones, for re-establishing my faith in the new breed of film directors. Not all's lost!!
","Cinema is an art, beautiful, complex and surreal . To make a good film requires more than just money and a fancy equipment. The problem nowadays is that it has become more and more difficult to actually find the art in cinema . We have movies coming out, it seems in factory lines, with a particular format of budget and emotions. And all this while we forget to add the soul in films.... the soul which makes it what it is, but then again every once in a while we come across something which surprises us but at the same time we find the familiarity of likeness which we have been seeking for so long. It need not be too fancy or too flashy. All it needs to be is a good idea, cleverly executed. Source Code is a perfect example of that! Having heard a lot about the film, I still kept my expectations low. In comparison to the brand of cinema (in 3D, might I add) we've been witnessing lately, it wasn't surprising that people have developed a tendency of appreciating anything mediocre these days. What I saw, however, blew my mind away. Not because it was an extremely well crafted script, not because Jake Gyllenhaal performed spectacularly but because it managed to join the small list of films which I entitle as beautiful. Made on a reported budget of a mere 35 million dollars, it did what most of these so called blockbusters haven't managed to do, made me sit in one place for one and a half hour......in awe.'Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up to find himself on a train heading to Chicago. Although the other passengers all seem to know him, he has absolutely no idea where or even who he is. The last thing Colter remembers is flying a helicopter mission in Iraq, but here he is in someone else's life, being referred to as 'Sean' by his traveling companion (Michelle Monaghan). Even the man in the mirror looks nothing like him. Before he can find out what's going on, an express train zooms by on the opposite track and a bomb on the train explodes.Colter then wakes up in a chamber where an officer on the screen (Vera Farmiga) tells him that he has just returned from the 'Source Code', a secret government project which lets him go back to the last 8 minutes of a person's life and re-live it. His job is to use those 8 minutes in order to find out who the bomber on the train was as that is their only key to saving the other places where the bomb has been planted.The movie works on a large scale mostly due to the combined brilliant efforts of both the director and its lead actor. Jake Gyllenhaal displays a wonderful presence of character and has, after a long time given such a wonderful performance, supported well by the rest of the cast members which includes a surprise number in the form of Russel Peters. Also remarkable were the special effects which showed that YOU DO NOT NEED 3D TO MAKE A VISUALLY WELL SHOT FILM, but what works most for the film is its human element which manages to make an otherwise imperfect film, beautiful. Being a science fiction film it could well have gone down the path taken by most science-fiction films where good concept is traded off for action scenes and everything that could have helped it become a masterpiece is flushed down the drain. Instead, Source Code walks down a different path... it chooses to have a soul (a la Vanilla Sky, Blade Runner and Inception) Every time Colter goes back for eight minutes, it feels as if we are back for another short adventure, building our anticipation about what indeed we are going to find next. Director Duncan Jones manages to make a fast-paced gripping thriller and displays enough reasons why he will be the one to watch out for in the years to come! With every film, he is evolving into a fantastic direct0r. Moon suggested it and now Source Code confirms it too. That's 2/2 for you! If Inception and now Source Code are anything to go by, rest assured this decade, might turn very well turn out to be the age of intelligent, thrilling science fiction movies.Thank you Duncan Jones, for re-establishing my faith in the new breed of film directors. Not all's lost!! Rating: 8/10 Written by Vikram Agarwal for MuvieMadlyDeeply.com",8,3,5,18 May 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," Expect Good things from this Director in the days to come!!
","The Adjustment Bureau The Adjustment Bureau is a 2011 supernatural thriller directed by George Nolfi. It stars Matt Damon (Oceans series, Good will hunting) and Emily Blunt ( Wolfman, The devil wears Prada) Before I begin I would like to add that this was the first time I ever went for a movie without knowing what it's about or who is in it. I just bought the ticket to escape the heat and was hardly expecting anything spectacular. The fact that I was actually surprised came as quite a bonus considering how I was actually planning to sleep off the entire viewing time.So anyways the movie started off as a typical political thriller with its intense moments indicated by the music and an entirely huge collection of men in suits, all looking grave and serious. In fact i was half expecting it to be something on the lines of Michael Clayton if only half as good. It was only after 15 minutes into the film that the scenario completely flipped . From men in suits carrying books and files to time taking a halt and notebooks with digitally moving parts to even sets changing from one location to another through weird doorways. It was then that i realised that this movie was going to be anything but boring.The movie starring Matt Damon and Emily blunt is a romantic science fiction thriller and we all know how rare that is. It follows the life of David Norris (Matt Damon) who is running for the Senate. Due to unexpected circumstances he looses his lead in the election and is thus at a point where he has to deliver his final speech before the final results come in. Here is where he encounters a girl who in 5 minutes changes his prospective on things after which he decides to change his rehearsed speech and delivers something spectacularly honest and offbeat. Even thou he loses the current election his unorthodox move puts him as a favourite for the next elections.All through this we witness strange men in overcoats and hats watching and monitoring his entire move. The next day he runs into her again on a bus even thou we are told that certain people were trying their level best to make sure he misses his bus. From then on it sets off a series of incidents which according to the men in hats was never supposed to happen. That is when they intervene and introduce themselves as the Adjustment Bureau. A group with extraordinary powers who follow the orders of the 'Chairman' (a synonym of angels following the orders of GOD) . They inform him that he is supposed to be very important for mankind and his further association with the girl might jeopardise the entire 'Plan' Their job was to make sure that things move according to plan. They have maps which charts out the path of every human being. They can change and arrive at any location instantly through a series of doorways. They can cause incidents on their own will and they were willing to put all their resources to use to make sure these two never meet. Bizarre as it sounded he agrees to their conditions. But a thing like love and curiosity is a lethal combination. From there on the movie turns into a roller coaster ride as we follow every step of Norris to discover how things unfold.As a movie it surprised me to a great extent as I never actually believed that it would be this entertaining. This being the first directorial venture of George Nolfi , whose writing credits include The Bourne Ultimatum and Oceans Twelve, he did quite a fine job in doing justice to the plot which in itself could have gotten quite convoluted and confusing . Instead he introduced a certain smooth flow to the entire plot where no scene seemed unnecessary and there were hardly any blank or boring moments. One could say the concept came a little close to being like City Of Angels only with less mush and a more solid story line. The performances of both the leads as well as the side characters were believable but nothing spectacular, for after all it was more of a story driven movie rather than performance. We expect good things from this director in years to come.Rating: 3.5/5 Vikram Agarwal for MuvieMadlyDeeply.com",7,0,1,18 May 2011
A Clockwork Orange," Dark, Disturbing, Beautful!
","Having heard so much about Stanley Kubrick and this movie, atlast I got to watch it. For a movie made in 1971, I was completely blown away by the sheer brilliance of it. Without giving away much, A Clockwork Orange is based on a novel of the same name by Anthony Burgess. Set in the future Britain where 16 year old Alex is jailed after one his raped victims die, he volunteers for an experiment designed by the government in an effort to solve the crime problems of the society. To begin with, I must admit, A Clockwork Orange is undoubtedly one of the most artistic pieces of cinema I have seen in a long, long time. The character of 'Alex' (played brilliantly by Malcolm McDowell) is pure evil, sending shivers down your spine. Everything about him is so evil, so dark. The movie, which looks more like a stage-play version and less like a movie is enthralling, especially the conversations between Alex and his partners. The movie is disgusting, dark, sinister, gross, violent and very very artistic. The power of the movie is that it stays for hours after it has ended. In fact, this is one of the reasons why it took me a day and a half before I got down to review this movie, those disturbing images stick with you in your head... 'A Clockwork Orange' is one of the best films that I've seen and I wish I never see it again.The performances are all top-notch and it wouldn't be wrong to say that Malcolm McDowell's 'Alex' is in the same league as Sir Anthony Hopkins' 'Dr. Hannibal Lector'. The background score goes perfectly with the movie's theme. The dialogues are both, very well-written and very well delivered. Honestly, its tough to find negative things about a movie that's, in my opinion, nearly flawless, but here's what I could manage to find: The movie starts losing its grip towards the middle. Some scenes in the movie were completely unnecessary and the nudity element could've been cut down a little, it disgusts you but I guess that's exactly why Kubrick chose to put it in the first place.'A Clockwork Orange' is strongly recommended for anyone that loves cinema in its purest form. It has everything you could ask for... and then some more. Of course there's a lot of violence and nudity in the movie but it all serves the purpose. Rated to be one of Kubrick's best pieces of work (I wouldn't know coz I haven't seen much but it's definitely one of the best I have seen), 'A Clockwork Orange' is almost perfect in every term. Watch it, if for nothing else, then an experience called 'Kubrick's cinema' that you're surely not going to forget for a very long time.... if ever!!! Rating:- 8.5/10",9,0,2,14 July 2008
Thor," It's meant to entertain! It's meant to provide us with the Summer Blockbuster we've been waiting for! Unfortunately it does neither!!
","THOR Directed by: Kenneth Branagh Cast: Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston, Anthony Hopkins and Erik Selvig Dear Kenneth Branagh . We like you , we really do but when you take something which is meant to be entertaining and turn it into a boring melodramatic tale of fathers and sons who like to play with trippy lights and hammers which go underutilised in one place throughout most of the film......it just ticks us off.Thor is a summer blockbuster. Thor is meant to be a break from low budget films and is supposed to provide us with a blockbuster feel. But unfortunately it does neither. Instead what you get is a movie which starts off well, introduces good looking characters and then while we wait for that moment which leaves you grasping for air it takes a dive down and provides us utter disappointment. Like many others I love summer blockbusters. It's that time of the year when we don't really care for mind boggling theatricality and twisted convoluted plots (although if we get them too along with the high budgets then two thumbs up). Instead we just like to lie back as we watch things blow up and watch characters do amazing things in slow motion. Everything in short that a 200 million budget should provide us with.It's with that expectation that I went for Thor. Having watched a couple of films of the director I knew that although unconventional, good things were expected out of the film which claimed to have merged the world of mythology and superheroes in one film. Odin (Anthony Hopkins) is the king of Asgard who has claimed victory over the frost giants. He has two sons, Loki ( Tom Hiddleton) and an arrogant yet charismatic Thor( Chris Hemsworth) . As the elder son Thor is to step on to the throne. But a sudden attack from the frost giants makes him disobey his father and go to their planet to wage an attack with the help of his friends.Arriving just on time Odin rescues Thor and his Troupe but is enraged by his actions and henceforth banishes him to Earth and strips him of his powers and from his hammer (which is his mighty weapon). Arriving on earth he bumps into Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), a scientist, who agrees to help him in exchange for his explanation of the galactic phenomena through which he arrived on Earth. From here on most of the film focuses on him searching for his hammer and on discovering the plot because of which the events were in motion.As a film it started off well and did delight us with amazing effects. It even moved at a steady pace and looked all set to finish off well. Till the first half it seemed above average but then the second half took a steep drop with the climax being a complete let down. The basic motives of the characters seemed to be lost and we got over dosed with the light effects and teleportations .As a super hero film the action was mostly missing replaced instead by men in suits who looked completely lost and out of clue. Throughout most of the second half we kept looking forward for the wow moments which we felt sure had to be there. Just as we got the spark and we sat up straight we realised that the moment was gone and alas it never returned again. Even the romantic equation between Hemsworth and Portman never actually set properly with everything feeling incomplete.As characters Chris Hemsworth did justice to his role and Portman did the best she could with her role but the other characters hardly roused any emotions and yes I include Anthony Hopkins as well. It seemed they packed all that they could in the first half and let the second half drag and suffer in the process. Disappointing is the word.Rating 5.5/10.Vikram Agarwal for MuvieMadlyDeeply.com",6,2,4,18 May 2011
