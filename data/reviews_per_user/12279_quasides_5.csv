The Equalizer," The Good, the bad and the Ugly
","This Movie has it all,...The Good: Denzel Whashington, Great Presents, just a few more Lines and a slower Backstory would have been nice. He is Doing a Great Job.The Sound is Great too, mix well with the Style of that film.The Filming was very good too. Very Stylish, cool almost understated, the used CGI blend in well isn't to much overstated. This Aspect was done right.***LITTLE SPOILERS AHEAD (i keep em down i promise)*** The Bad: The Storyline. It doesn't make any sense why after he decided to start his war also a lot of other people, not related to the Mob, crossing his path in a bloody way. Also Nobody seems to bother afterward, he still can visit his old caf√©, living in the same neighborhood, nobody specially not the Police cares much. Also the Action of the Russian Mobster who came to investigate doesn't make any sense. All his actions where for no reason and no purpose.Also the jumps and almost fast tracks of short story lines made no sense. Less would have been more. More slow calm backstory about his personality and life, less small action plot and more logic would have been appreciated.Also the complete absence how he is doing his secret spy work isn't really satisfying. He is working like a ghost not only to the enemy but also the the audience. This give the movie a certain character but sadly it was replaced by dull action sequences.The Ugly: The fighting scenes (some of them). Its laughable how those Mobster with their 50k Equipment even go into a fight, they acted like some lemmings (in the game) not like some ex military mobster muscles.ANd why again was the Mobster hunting the security guard? ***MORE SPOILERS ***Also if someone get shot in his shoulder, you can really fight with it after, you can simply burn it to close it and keep going, there are broken bones, there is a projectile, that he is fixing himself under a shelf while ex-speznatz with nightvision looking for him .. well sorry that was too much.The Worst action sequence where that nail pistol can shoot over 20 yards, penetrate (didn't he have a bullet resistant west?) a hole body and go trough.Bottom Line: This Movie has its Moments and is often beautiful to watch but again and again bad writers ruined it. There would have been potential but it wasn't used. Its still very good watchable only for Dencel himself.",6,1,4,17 December 2014
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Overrated as usual, they pretend to tryed but never did
","Its really concerning the mount of positive Reviews this Movie got, as it is for all Marvel so called Movies. Even frighning those Reviews stating that this Movie has a Story ... well....it doesn't, not really.The Story: They just pretended to five an James Bond/Conspircary like Story but it was far of, with nonsense logical hoops but all that was more like a sidekick. This Movie don't know what it wants to be so you get from everything a little and endup with a mix of something thats nothing.The Action: is as usual nonsense but at least a bit less as we are used to from Marvel and there where fine funny details in it. But at the end overdoing like Marvel likes todo - well its a comic...The Acting: Well, there was no real room for such. Specially Robert Redford had almost no lines and his scenes often didn't make any sense. At the end we have a high level cast but wasted their potential.Bottom Line just another average Marvel crap flooding the cinemas these days, questionable WHY people and critics are so over the top. Only because it became so normal to have no story at all doenst make this script any better. Pretending to have a story doenst make one.",1,20,43,28 September 2014
Interstellar," One of the best Movies and still ....
","First of many aspect of the Movie are well made and its defiantly worth watching. But it has it really deep scripting flaws and i want to stick with them.So sadly they marketed as scientific accurate movie, well not so much. Yes they got many details right and still have massive flaws that it really hurts. Its really sad because that Movie could have been a timeless masterpiece...So here we go: #1: Radiation. Never mentioned it still our worst enemy in Space. in Fact Its the one problem we cant even imagine how to solve yet while all other problems seem to be solvable in the near future (near like 100 Years). But OK lets ignore that for a moment.#2: The Timeless planet. Well here it becomes nonsense. You can have 2 forms of time dilation. One by speed the other by gravitation. Well you have to know that the Time difference between earth and space (satellite orbit is 0.0000000001 seconds per Day) So in order to have a 7 Years / Hour you would need massive gravitation. More than a planet could hold or a human would survive, more than we would be able to escape with that little ranger#3: exploration of planet next to a black hole. Well simple logic if we don't have much time, no scientist would even bother to look a planets next to a black hole. let gravitation aside and the main problem of a stable orbit of a planet orbiting a sun orbiting a black hole (or no sun if orbiting a black hole) and the massive gravitation forces working on such a planet, the radiation would simply burn everything aways from its surface.simple logic, black holes are very nasty we don't go near them, let alone try to make a living on a planet orbiting one. #4: why not giving cooper one day to prepare his family. they didn't even knew about him hours ago and now he has only a few minutes to prepare his kids that we be gone forever? this is a major part of the storyline and still makes no sense at all.#5: on earth they need big thrusters to escape still on the other planet (with even higher gravity) they easily enter and leave with their rangers#6: air, uhh they found him with almost depleted oxygen. Well but where did he store that much to have enough time to transmit complex data in morse code (which would take endless). still he is breathing and using his tanks so the argument no time in a black hole well doesn't really count does it?#7: all that tech - and still they have to land to find out that there is only water and only ice? no high resolution cams and radar? you don't examine the surface before you land even you have no contact to the guys landed first? Those are the major parts i can think of right now. Most of em are major if not absolute necessary parts of the storyline and its sad to make such unnecessary errors.While i think the idea of trying to understand 5 dimensions in a movie is tempting the end still is a very far and very magical stretch. it just doenst fit a movie which trys to stay technical focused and then drift almost into magicAnd even all of that its still worth watching, many other aspects are done great, Matthew McConaughey and all the 'murphs' doing great.most scifi movies of the last 20 years have massive logic problems so the movie can survive its own due of lack of competition in that field. it has great visuals and i personally like the fact that they took their 3 hours to build slowly their story. you can even get a glimpse of the political and social implications of the future which is nice.still it leaves the bitter taste of an missed opportunity and an even more bitter by the idea that the last of mankind are only Americans :)",8,1,4,16 March 2015
Taken," Good Movie but missed Chance
","Lion Neeson as Operative, who would have thought about that. He really Nailed the Role and its his Performance made this Movie.However i see here a big missed Chance. A more subtle approach with less Body's and smaller Armys to fight him would haven given it a bit more Realistic touch.And even there only few short Gunfights they are sadly Hollywood like unrealistic. It would have been better to let him slip away from the Factory instead of pumping his Car full of Bullets and leave all Passengers unharmed (even tough also Rifles where hitting it there badly)Also instead of legions of Bodys, a more believable Reaction by the other Characters would be less Painful to watch. Almost any other Character here acted between odd and super duper stupid. This is a shame because that Movie had a potential to be a Masterpiece. Its till above Average, specially for that Genere, but still.",7,1,1,24 July 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Another example whats wrong in this industry
","When you make a remake you should not do it completely differently. This isn't Madmax, its something different and something new. The sad part is that they simply use a classic to sell it.Even worse, instead of saving money and make it simpler, they overdone it.More effect, more crazyness, overdoing everything and everyall. Just Pump in Effects, Pump in more and crazy ideas.BUT never ever think about writing a smart script or get good acting.And thats the hole Problem nowadays. Movies today are too much of action, too much of effects, to much of dumping money but they are empty. They have no soul, so they become irrelevant, yet even boring despite massive spectacular action scenes which seem to never end.This movie is the best example for that.",3,35,72,3 August 2015
