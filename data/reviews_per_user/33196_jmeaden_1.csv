Casablanca," Played again, and again, Sam.
","Casablanca is so well known as a classic, that I wish I didn't like it.  I hate movies that people over hype with 'must see' and so on.  However, this movie is truly the greatest film ever made.  It has everything you could ever want.Please, do me a favour.  Go see it at the cinema in the original B&W next time it is playing (you can usually find it somewhere).  Don't see it for the first time on some dinky rehashed colorized version on a 14' television screen - it doesn't deserve it.It was the first LD I ever purchased, and is still the most watched movie I own.",10,1,1,27 January 1999
