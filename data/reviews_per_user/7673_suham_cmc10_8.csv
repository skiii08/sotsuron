Despicable Me 2," Prepare your smile
","Get ready for lots of comedy, guys. After a long time I've got so much fun and comedy things in a movie. Specially it is a real bumper for the kids. I've also watched with my nephews, nieces and friends. You will get the same enjoyment and I should say that it is a family film and all the members of your family could watch it together and have lots of fun. The cutie little yellow cartoons. They were just awesome and direction , the comedy in this film, undoubtedly this is the best comedy film in 2013 with some cutie love things. Hats off to the director. The music, graphics everything is cool. So it is a must watched movie and what to say more. Enjoy and don't forget to smile.",9,0,0,20 August 2013
Man of Steel," Ready for the Razzie award
","I am sorry to admit that this is one of the average sci-fi action film I often observed. Nothing so special about this film. But I am sure kids and some teenager may like it because of high exposure of visual graphics and simple dialog and most importantly , this is their bedtime story superman! But for the adult, you will sure be bored about those ridiculous visual graphics. Its kind of science Fiction I admit, because of the high tech instruments , alien suit, space ship, launcher you will find out. It will remind you that watching some kind of cartoon of flesh and blood (I doubt that) ! Its about the world, not only a country, if you are from Asia or Africa even Europe and Australia, you will find it weird. There are lots of destruction showed and some people never got hurt , the people of this planet and director focused on them repeatedly. I pretended that it would be the masterpiece of superman but disappointed. I am really thinking about ratings of this film. How could it be 7.7 , it should be 6-7 not more than that. If you want to experience lots of fantasy with average acting, you can see it. It shocked the Box office but it is a simple action film nothing else. Hope you are agree with me.",6,3,5,14 August 2013
American Psycho," Mysterious Unknown Psychotic
","One of the most difficult different and unsolved movies I have seen. It was total psychotic. Things happening one after another and you can not mix up the sequence. I am describing the whole.Acting : What to say about Bale? He was mind-blowing all through the movie. I should inscribe that there is only one character in this film that is Bale. I will give 9.6 to his acting. He showed the best as a psycho and expressions all the time. What could I say that is speech less. The supporting roles are also very good.Direction : In a word, the direction is better than many other crime thriller psychedelic film. That's really unique. The violent scenes was not directed perfectly. He left some questions such as 'why the lawyer said that he had lunch with Paul Allen whether we know that she was dead ' , 'where are the dead bodies part' 'why there was biography of Patrick' (7.9)Dialogue : Better (8.7) Effects : Better (9.3) Screening : nice (9.0) Music : very good (8.5) Scripts and Story : good (7.6)Thanks for such stuff !!!",8,0,0,11 July 2013
Thor," The theme of Norse
","1. Good job by the marvels again. 2. I am not satisfied by this film, I know that its a fantasy action film, but the acting is totally disaster. 3. Some errors that made me real freak about this film noted below:a) The guy Thor came from another planet, where no earthy technology already existed, when DARSY wants to take a picture for FACEBOOK, he understood and had smile. isn't it ridiculous?b) It could be much better if KENNETH ( director) would manage two different accents or languages or some phonetic differences between two planets speaking.c) I don't know it was HELMSWORTH or KENNETH's fault that guy coming from another planet had no wonder about running vehicles & technologies. I think it is the failure of HELM to make us understand that stuff.d) At one scene you will notice that Loki is dressed suit and tie on earth no explanation on that matter in the film.e) Recognizing JANE's diary, find out Thor within sometimes, connecting place and a lot. 4. Poor dialogue but nice story. 5. Tremendous visual effect. Liked it. 6. Unworthy expression made bad acting such as HELMSWORTH 7. NATALI did her role so well. 8. God job by WESLEY, PATRIK, HARRIS and KENNETH.",6,1,2,9 July 2013
The Departed," Replication
","After watching Infernal Affairs (2002) its really unacceptable that legendary Director like Martin Scorsese just copied the screens, scripts, story of the whole movie. My little man inside of me wants to know the reason. Moreover I watched The departed in 2012 and Infernal affairs in 2016, Director even not acknowledge the credits of that movie. Shame for Hollywood to appreciate such movie in the Oscar and so far other awards like Golden Globe. The story was a one twisted piece of mystery and director copied it. Its beyond my belief Director such as him done it. The juniors who will watch this review before watching Departed, I want to suggest them to watch Infernal Affairs first and then Departed. I am not going to change my previous vote until its rating downs. One vote is a nano matter against millions of votes but its also a symbol of millions of conscience.",10,0,2,3 May 2016
The Croods," A perfect family Croods
","I want you to remind you that don't see the movie alone. It could be boring but not monotonous, I guarantee. But you could not find the zest of the movie. I think you've already know the story behind the movie. Its all about a family which maintains its safety from the beginning of the film. Ready for experiencing lots of beautiful natural scenarios, new animated animal, colorful plants, high mountains filled with high tech visual graphics. From my view it can not be a comedy thing. I've not found anything to laugh. But I could assure you, it could be one of the best adventure film in this year, showing lots of unpredicted, unimaginable graphics. My suggestion is watch this movie with all your family members, you will ultimately find out 'Family is the root by which we are bind to this earth and have a meaning for survival'. So enjoy!",6,0,2,20 August 2013
Fantastic Four," Busted Fantastic Four
","Total disaster I could say,nothing else. I liked the story. The beginning sounds to me that it could be rather very good. Problem creates when the acting proceeds. They tried to provide comedy, action, fantasy, science fiction. From my view their attempt is in vein completely. Tried to fix up the dialogues but acting spoiled them. Director tried to show some romance like other science fiction superhero film, I must admit one worst romance and boring dialogues I experienced. The stuff I liked is the effects limited to some extent. in a whole direct or tried to make it serious, but it appeared to us as a cartoon. Sorry guys.",5,0,3,10 July 2013
Warm Bodies," Wonderful Zombie Romance
","Its my best Zombie film I've ever seen. Undoubtedly the whole team worked hard for the result I guess . I assure again that they are succeeded, my ratings anyway is 7.4.Music : The stuff which kept alert and amused and puzzled me is the music. Nice choice and nice tracks according to feelings and expressions. I will give 8.5 for the music.Acting : Nicholas is so hot and damn handsome zombie I admit. He did good. Palmer was looking so cute and sweet here that I wish I could be there. Her stuff was cool. The supporting roles were average. However I rate acting 7.5.Direction : Better than many other zombie films I've seen. Thanks to the director for reducing violation and brought some sweet thing in this type of film. (7.2)Dialogues : Liked it. (7.5)Screenings and Scripts : could be better to make it masterpiece. (6.8)Story : Well on the air. (7.1)I liked the biography of Nicholas also.So guys don't miss the Zombie Romance.",7,0,1,12 July 2013
