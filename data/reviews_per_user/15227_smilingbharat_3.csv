Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Too much of Jack Sparrow!
","Similar to the original in mood and tone,this movie is definitely better than the third movie in the series.But not the best in the series.Its strictly average,even for hardcore Johnny Depp fans.This movie has wafer thin storyline,little action,little comedy and nothing feels complete.Everywhere on the screen you see Jack Sparrow and little of other characters.Even his character has got nothing new to offer! Just the usual witty(is it still witty at all?) last minute escapes.Even the Visual effects weren't awesome or anything,just OK.The third movie does a better job in that category. Just another movie sequel that is made for squeezing money!",6,0,4,20 May 2011
Inception," This Blew me away!!!!!!
","Christopher Nolan is a Genius.Nothing new in that.But the new thing is that he had paired with DiCaprio this time.DiCaprio already has gem this year with Shutter Island and now the count increases to two.The first hour of the movie tells you everything and you wonder what is left in the next hour and here comes the action.What was told in the previous hour was shown practically.This Movie contains 3 layers and a surprising and revealing 4th layer.The concept is brilliant, direction top notch and acting sufficient.The music by Hanzzimmer is haunting.I earnestly hope that this movie bags few Oscars.Let this movie be honored.One surely remembers MATRIX during the movie.Though the concept is quite different,the in differentiation between reality and dreaming reminds you of Matrix.Anyways this is quite original.hats off NOLAN.But definitely if you expect some real mindless action you'll be disappointed.This is Brainy thriller which keeps the viewer thinking and guessing.So all you people who just wants a movie for entertainment.Stay out.The remaining just enjoy this movie with your heads on.Film Making at it's Best. I gave it 8 on 10 only because I saw it just twice.My rating might get higher on repeated viewings.",8,4,8,16 July 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Everything must END, good or bad, and this is it!
","Well where to start?Should I tell you about the days we all waited to read the books, or waited desperately for the movies,even though we know that they were no match to the books?Now there are all 8 films out there, the potter films and the 7-I remains the best for me ,even after the final installment.Steve Cloves have taken few cinematic liberties that may have defied the logic of the Wizarding world that's created by J.K.Rowling, but look apart from them, its fine as a film.Nostalgia- is the word, plays too much with the mind. Music is subtle and great, special effects are very neatly doneAnd the pacing is fine,but the battle of Hogwarts is no where near EPIC, that's the only disappointment, No one expects a Lord of the Rings, but it can be done in much better, but this is the way David Yates chose it to be.Good or Bad, don't you know you're gonna watch it?So go to the nearest cinemas and prepared to be in JOY and Sorrow both at a time!",7,0,3,15 July 2011
