The Ring," The Scariest!
","I consider myself a horror movie lover, but so far no movie: old, new, classic or gory, can top 'the ring'. This movie is truly terrifying. After watching it there were many night i had to sleep with lights on, pretty embarrassing, but true.'The ring' looks and feels real. The imagery just gets in your brain and you can't stop thinking about it. The tape itself is creepy and the reactions from all the characters are very close to real reactions (if it was real). The girl: Samara (Daveigh Chase), really nailed this role, she was scary, weird and creepy.I definitely recommend watching this movie!",10,1,1,27 March 2013
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," I just can't stand it!
","***SPOILERS***Maybe this saga is a great movie for teenagers, i'm not sure, but it is definitely not for someone who is a fan of vampires! first of all the 'actors' are bad, just like in any of the Twilight movies. the movie itself is very boring, only the ending part, the 'fight' is entertaining. i was actually excited that some of the characters died, but then they had to ruin it.....it was all a vision! what? why? just have a real fight, please, after all, this is supposed to be a movie about Vampires: blood sucking, thirsty, dead monsters, who can try to behave and look like human if they train, but don't really need to do it. also i'm sorry to say, but vampires don't have sex.... they can't have children as they are DEAD! they can fall in love and be passionate, but not conceive a child. to sum it up: the books and the movies are for teenagers (not the smart ones :) ) it's just boring and in no way entertaining. and seeing Kristen's frozen face for 2 hours is a bit too much. no hating, just the truth.",2,7,15,25 March 2013
Sinister," disturbing
","The movie 'Sinister' is very intense. Some scenes are very disturbing as it shows the murders in details. Actors were great, especially the children. I think Ethan Hawke did a great job portraying a writer/father, who had his 15 minutes of fame and can't get over it. He is actually a talented writer, but he refuses to write crap, which i personally respect. i loved the scenes of him watching the recordings, he reacted the way most of us would react.However moving to a crime scene house is a bit too much, he crossed the line and is going to pay for it. the ending was unexpected for me. I thought he will just finish the investigation and find a way to get rid of the evil, but NOPE! it actually scared me to find out the who the real murderer was.I don't want to give a lot of details, but will definitely recommend watching the movie.",8,1,2,25 March 2013
