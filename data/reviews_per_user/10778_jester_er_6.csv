Catch Me If You Can," A Fun and Witty Holiday Flick......
","Frank Abagnale(Christopher Walken) is a struggling store owner who has a wife and a loving son Frank Abagnale Jr.(Leonardo Di Caprio). When Frank Abagnale Jr. has to go to public school instead of private because of financial problems. Frank Jr. pretends to be a substitue teacher for his French class to escape taunting by the other students. When Frank Jr.'s mom has an affair with another man, Frank Jr.'s parents decide to get a divorce. This causes Frank Jr. to run away from home never to return. Only a few weeks away from home young Frank Jr. learns how to con his way through the somewhat naive 60's. When Frank Abagnale Jr. was less than 18 years old he had earned his spot as the youngest man ever to be on the FBI's 10 most wanted list. He had succesfuly impersonated a teacher, airline pilot, lawyer, and doctor before being caught by Carl Hanratty(Tom Hanks). Frank was caught in Europe and sent to a European Prison, then transfered to an American Prison. After being in American prison for a couple of months, the FBI decided to hire Frank Abagnale Jr. in the check forging and bank fraud department under Carl's supervision. Today Frank Abagnale Jr. has a wife and kids, and still works with the FBI where he has made thousands of dollars helping the FBI catch crooks. This movie is one of my favorite Spielberg films. It's one of his only films that is light hearted and charming. This film is'nt bogged down, and keeps the audiances attention all the way through. I love the Christmas Eve phone calls(which by the way never happened), and the witty dialogue. 'Catch Me If You Can' is a fast paced, fun, witty, and charming Holiday Film.",Null,0,1,3 January 2003
Fight Club," clever, provocative, mind blowing......
","Fight Club is clever, provocative, mind blowing, and humorus all rolled into one. An amazing black comedy based on the book by Chuck P. and directed by David Fincher. The cast includes Ed Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, and a cameo appearence by Meatloaf. From start to finish its a long twisted road of humor and wit with its anti corporate message. Jack ( Ed Norton) plays an insomniac absorbed in modern day conviences and designer furniture. When Jack visits a cancer support group and meets the big moosie, Bob  ( Meatloaf ),  he suddenly lets go and finds a cure for his insomnia. He becomes addicted to various support groups and finds sleep every night. Until Marla ( Helena Bonahm Carter ) ruins everything by showing up at one of  Jack's support groups. Jack then falls back into insomnia and seeks a new way out. While traveling on a business trip he meets Tyler Durden ( Brad Pitt ) one of Jack's most interesting 'single serving friends' he has ever met on an airplane. Tyler makes and sells soap to major department stores for a living. When Jack  returns to his condo only to find it blowen to pieces he calls upon Tyler for a place to stay. Soon everything whirls out of control starting with a basement 'Fight Club' and growing into 'Project Mayhem.' The ending will blow your mind, and leave you wanting to view this film again. See it twice this week.",Null,0,1,1 January 2003
The English Patient," Close to Perfect
","This film was almost perfect. It had two of the most powerful themes to explore, Love and War. And it told them with skill and excellance. The critics couldnt ask for a more complex film. Each character with his/her own internal battles as well as their relationships with one another. It contained Passion, Revenge, and Remorse. When an English man is found horribly burned in the wreckage of a plane crash, and is cared for by an army nurse Hana in a retreat found in Italy. And two men, Kip and a british mine sweeper, pitch a tent outside the retreat tower, and work to rid the area of bombs. And a strange and perhaps the most entertaining character decides to stay at the retreat.The english patient's story unfolds with a tale of passion and advendture. Ralph Fienns is stunning, and my favorite performance is deleverd by Willam Defoe. The most memorable scene is the victory night when everyone learns the war is over. I strongly suggest everyone film fan see this movie it is well deservant of its 9 oscars.",Null,1,3,30 December 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Two Words......Pure Entertainment
","Ok Oceans 11 is not provocative, dark, or mind blowing, BUT it is pure entertainment that you will love. With a cast of so many stars it's hard not to enjoy. Every time you look at the screen you see somthing beautiful or important. Lets face the facts the old 1960 Oceans 11 was not as good simply because no one was sober enough or cared enough. People paide to see Frank and his bunch......just to see Frank and his bunch. But for this remake Steven Soderbergh(Erin Brocavich) did a fantastic job. And Stephen Mirrione casted some of the biggest names in Hollywood, George Clooney, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Brad Pitt, Carl Reiner, Bernie Mac, Julia Roberts, Don Cheadle, and perhaps the most interesting and humorous caracter Elliott Gould. And everyone of them lived up to their excpectations. The cinematography by Peter Andrews and Steve Soderbergh was amazing. And the catchy original music by David Holmes and Claude Debussy completed the package. Needless to say everyone did their part, and if you have not seen this film by now GO AND SEE IT!!.....Oceans 11(2001) is a great flick.",Null,0,0,1 January 2003
Meet Joe Black," Original and Mind Blowing
","My first review of this film was way to plain and short because i was short on time so here is my second stab at it. This was an excellant film. It was unique and well thought out. The idea of making a deal with death was well above the screenplays we see today. Although it could have been cut down. It has some clever lines, but some scenes are too long to keep your whole attention. Anthony Hopkins is extrodinary as usual, and Brad Pitt kept up his end of the deal. The best part in this whole film is the witty and clever scene with Bill, Joe, and Drew. I recommend this film for people who appreciate film making and want another piece to critique.",Null,1,2,30 December 2002
