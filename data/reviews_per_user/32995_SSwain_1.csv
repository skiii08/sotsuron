Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Overall great film
","I think it was a great movie.  Definitely not as good as Episodes IV, V, and VI, but a great movie none-the-less.  The movie had a good story line and awesome special effects.  One thing I did not like in the movie was the part where Queen Amidala, and others, shot some kind of cord thing out of their guns and used them to pull themselves up to the next window.  It reminded me of a Batman movie or something.  Overall, though, I thought the movie was great, although, I think Star Wars fan(atic)s might enjoy it more then non-fan(atic)s because of all the clues towards the characters and things in Episodes IV, V, and VI.  A must see movie.",9,0,0,23 May 1999
