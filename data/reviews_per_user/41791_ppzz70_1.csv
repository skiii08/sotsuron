The Blair Witch Project," incredible disappointment
",This movie was the most disappointing movie of the decade. The massive hype accompanying the film further reinforced its dismal impact. There was no justifiable ending whatsoever and it wasn't scary in the least. The acting and the editing were abysmal. The one redeeming factor of the film was that it was less than 90 minutes long.,2,0,2,1 April 2002
