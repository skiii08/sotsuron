Vertigo," You'll feel like you've run a marathon. This movie is 'exhausting'.
","Hitchcock's masterpiece. This film was made before I was born but it's appeal is timeless enough to make it one of my top ten favorite movies.Kim Novak openly challenges Grace Kelly in the glamor stakes. Her facial expressions are riveting and clearly meet Hitch's requirement to make cinema audiences squirm uncomfortably in their seats. She is everything 50's woman was and should be. Jimmy Stewart shows why he was justifiably the icon of an age. For me, Hitch was always able to get more from Jimmy Stewart than other directors. Looking at Rear Window and The Man Who Knew Too Much, Jimmy Stewart turns in a much better performance than in the countless westerns I've seen.Hitchcock has always messed with my head. Hitch led the way and other directors followed. There is a particular camera sequence in Vertigo when Madeleine (Kim Novak) runs up a spiral staircase and Scotty (Jimmy Stewart) follows. Special effects were somewhat limited in the 50's compared to today so Hitch used the spiral staircase and camera focus to convey the dizziness Scotty was feeling. Simple but effective. So effective in fact I've seen Spielberg use exactly this camera effect in one of his movies. Almost 50 years on and this work is still fresh.The script is well written and the atmosphere between Novak and Stewart can be cut with a knife. Everything tells the story - the script, the set, the costume and the physical interaction of the leads. There is an intense repressed passion about this movie. The cast sit on an emotional volcano that seems to be constantly on the verge of erupting.The classic Hitch-twist is a real surprise. Everything in your head tells you this could never be and Hitch takes you straight in that direction. There is a strange sense of voyeurism about the second part of this movie. It feels like you are seeing something that you really should not see. You are going into that small forbidden place that everyone keeps to themselves. That part that even husband and wife don't share. As a viewer that certainly makes me squirm uncomfortably in my seat, so I think Mr Hitchcock has achieved his objective.As a movie there are pieces that date and make it very obviously a 50's movie. However, the most important part, the plot the script and the relationship between the two protagonists - dress them in fashions for the 21st century and you could re-shoot this film today.What makes this movie so very special is the emotional roller-coaster ride Mr Hitchcock takes you on. The out-of-control speed and the wheels coming off at every turn and as you look to your left you see Hitch has turned into a squealing demon delighting in every second of your discomfort. You'll feel like you've run a marathon. This movie is 'exhausting'.",10,7,9,5 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," The action is all over the place! ...sadly so is the plot...
","If the target audience is those in search of some good swashbuckling mindless fun with explosions it's a bullseye. If you were hoping to follow the plot - take a notepad along...Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom are as they were in the first movie. The dynamic is still interesting, Jack Sparrow is still ducking and diving and is now so real I fear that if the wind changes Johnny Depp will stay like that. Rock on Keith! Yes, Keith Richard is truly the inspiration behind Johnny Depps portrayal of the role. In fact Keith Richards recently fell out of a coconut tree in Fiji. Which may explain the wonderful 'coconut' moment early on in the movie. This movie does have many wonderful moments of humor both visual and verbal, which is just as well as you will need a degree in advanced linguistics to follow the plot which was frankly a little silly in places. For me the leading trio saved this movie. I already liked the characters and had laughed with them and at them. If this was the first movie - I'm not sure I'd have paid to see a second.A couple of new items on the menu are worth mentioning; Bill Nighy as Davy Jones. Bill, you need to have a word with the screenwriter. As Davy Jones you were not threatening, evil or evil-funny. You were the uncle who comes over and sits next to the fire and is a bit grumpy. I appreciate it is difficult to characterize when you have an octopus on your face - so that's when you really need the script and plot to communicate for you, and in this case, sadly it didn't. Namoie Harris as Tia Dalma. What a delight! Watch this lady - her career is going to sky rocket. She was the highlight of the movie for me. Comic timing, facial expressions and vocalization she knows exactly what she's doing, I was enchanted, I was no longer sitting in a cinema I was with her and totally absorbed.So all in all - tighten up the script and simplify the plot for the next sequel, or leave more on the cutting room floor please. ...and by the way Keira is just starting to sound whiny and hysterically squeaky, I'd like to see her stronger and less squeaky in the next one. ...and yes, I'd like to see another one. For me the first was better, but this did not kill the franchise. It's a good fun movie - but you set my expectations higher Mr Verbinski, I'll forgive you once...but not twice.",8,2,6,5 July 2006
