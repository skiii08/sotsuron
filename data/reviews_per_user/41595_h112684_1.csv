The Hangover," The first 30mins. were very funny; but the rest was TERRIBLE-- Worst movie of the year if not decade
","The acting was all quite good, and the story's start looked very promising..;But.. Going into this movie my accompaniment and i both had high hopes for it, throughout the first 15-30mins things were looking promising; But IMMEDIATELY things took a turn for the worst. One sadly pathetic scene after another(the acting was still alright) but the plot had no strength to it and did not nearly live up to the hype which surrounded it(likegoing to try a pricey restaurant and receiving one scallop as an $12 appetizer; and a steak half the size of your fist for $30).Though I do enjoy each actor in their own respect, no matter how well any of them acted, the plot -every bit of storyline- was so terrible; TO SEE THIS MOVIE WOULD QUITE POSSIBLY BE THE BIGGEST WASTE OF YOUR RECORDED TIME ON THIS PLANET AS OF YET!",1,12,26,17 August 2009
