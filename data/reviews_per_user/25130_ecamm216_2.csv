Casablanca," Fast Paced with a Love Story
","This movie had started as a little confusing to me but as it kept going I was able to piece together what exactly was going on. I thought the movie as very fast paced and at times a little too much because I had gotten confused too much it felt. It is most certainly a movie I would enjoy to watch again to pick up the little details I had missed the first time. From what I saw and what I had gathered from this movie, I can see how iconic it really is.With everything that was going on in the movie, there was a nice love story that was just as fast paced as the movie was. The character Rick at first just seemed like a stubborn and not so emotional man but he starts to unravel over the course of the movie. The audience starts to see he is hurt that the love of his life is gone and now back in his life but is conflicted with what to do even though she is married. It is obvious the two still love each other and the tension and bitterness between the two of the them is apparent but, I felt the love story still worked within this.",8,0,1,20 October 2010
The Grapes of Wrath," Great Filming
","This movie had a lot of photography aspects to most of the shots. John Ford had started off the movie with what looked like a moving photo album; he made the countryside look beautiful. As the movie starts going, most of the movie is shot in dark and heavy shadows to show the dark times the Joad family was going through. Also, it seemed as if when the lighting had changed to being less dark, the family was going through a happier time in their journey to California.I had decided to rate this movie lower on a scale up to ten because I just couldn't get into it as much as I tried. I do appreciate the beauty that is in this movie, I just felt like it lasted too long. It just seemed that you could predict that this poor family could never catch a break and find what they needed and wanted. I feel that I may need to watch it again to understand everything a bit better and I would be willing to give this another try.",6,0,1,20 October 2010
