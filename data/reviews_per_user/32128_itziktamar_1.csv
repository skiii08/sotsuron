10 Cloverfield Lane," Why the Cloverfield connection?
","I came out of the theater feeling betrayed. Yes I knew this isn't Cloverfield 2 before going to the theater but as a huge fan of the first Cloverfield I went just to see what's going on in the Cloverfield universe. This movie destroyed it all.First and foremost, why even give us the Cloverfield connection? As this is yet another 'Is there a catastrophe outside or is he just insane' kind of movie (a genre we've seen at least 5 times in films already) connecting it with Cloverfield is just stupid since it takes the tension away. We know exactly what's waiting outside... With that, we know she WILL eventually get outside and so I spent all movie simply waiting for that moment not caring at all what will happen in that bunker, it was so obviously coming I had no interest in it.Then when she gets outside this movie manages to utterly destroy the Cloverfield story as well. The fight is well under way, apparently so far into it that humans have already figured out the way to fight the aliens (that apparently sent the monster from the first movie as a weapon) and it's all coming to an end.I feel cheated, I feel JJ decided to lure Cloverfield fans into a movie that's been done before and we've all seen many times, then connecting it to the first movie with 10 minutes at the end made in a stupid way that makes you think he didn't even care much about the Cloverfield storyline.Then after you leave the theater all annoyed that you've been jacked, you get even more angry finding out this ISN'T IN ANY WAY connected to Cloverfield except for baiting you into buying a ticket. At this point you just want to say **** you JJ, this is trolling at it's best.",2,12,23,23 April 2016
