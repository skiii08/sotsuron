The Avengers," A dull and predictable movie
","5Haven't seen many superhero movies in recent memory, hard to keep up with a Marvel or Dc flick coming out with the rhythm of one every month and a half, so I'm honestly getting pretty annoyed with this genre. The Avengers was one of the first to begin this endless stream, and probably the first 'ensemble of superheroes' to come out. Verdict : not good at all. Most of the characters are full of themselves and unbearable to watch in all their unpleasantness, others are just useless ragdolls, I've never felt even the slightest sign of danger or distress, and the funny parts weren't that funny. The movie is just a big moving toy with no personality whatsoever.",5,1,1,16 November 2017
Blade Runner 2049," Insanely good looking movie that goes even higher than the original
","8 1/2It's a solid sequel that doesn't hang too much on the elements of the previous movie, with just a few callbacks that are still well integrated in the plot and not just thrown there with no bond, but It is also an amazing movie on its own : Villeneuve imposes his style without being unfaithful to the overall atmosphere and feeling of the first Blade Runner. Roger Deakins does a masterful job once again and the soundtrack is awesome.",8,3,20,15 February 2018
It," A fun, enjoyable ride
","Being more of a growing up tale than an horror , the movie focuses on the young characters ( for as much as possible given the runtime ) : Dialogues are on point and hilarious, they sound pleasantly childish, like it should be and the relationship between each other are most of the time well defined. Penniwise doesn't appear much, but that's not necessarily a defect : Although different from Curry's interpretation, this one is still a solid embodiment of the creature designed by King. Technically speaking, I never thought I would enjoy the score of an horror movie so much, it was really on point and extremely well done, as for the rest, directing and photography were pretty good and functional to the movie. Only complaint regards the tone of the film, which sometimes gets too much over the top with a few scenes",7,2,3,15 November 2017
Inglourious Basterds," The perfect blend of tension and fun
","Probably the best between Tarantino's latest works, while watching Inglorious Basterds boredom will never show. This movie's dialogues are insane (the opening scene alone makes the perfect example of what I'm trying to say), they're cunning and witty, and everything else is of course as good as Tarantino can do it.",9,0,2,26 November 2017
Ready Player One," Just pure , mindless entertainment
","6 1/2 This movie sure won't be remembered for its intellectual content , neither for its original contribution to the sci fi genre, but there's still at least more than something to look at, like wildly entertaining action scenes and stunning visual effects , and that's basically why the movie was made in the first place. All characters are in fact extremely thin and the plot quite predictable.",6,1,3,1 April 2018
Shutter Island," It sets the mood very well with great directing and editing, but the ending is quite predictable.
","7 1/2Definitely above the standard psychological thriller, thanks to an immaculate technical execution, but still in the realms of the 'he was mad all along' formula. Still a very nice flick",7,0,0,20 August 2018
Dunkirk," Immersive and visually immaculate, but not fully engaging
","7 + I know this is not supposed to be the average war movie where you root for the protagonists but more of a 'documentary' take on the genre, and I appreciate the intention, but in the end it often felt a little too repetitive and not as special as I expected it to be. Sure, there are a few memorable scenes, expecially in the beginning, but from then on there are very few surprises. The soundtrack was unexpectedly annoying most of the time.",7,1,1,19 February 2018
It Follows," Nice start, terrible prosecution
","5 1/2 Wow, this movie was a huge disappointment. It starts incredibly well, with a goosebump prologue, and keeps an high level of suspense and mystery until we get to the beach scene, and there, things start to get trashy and stupid. The movie switches abruptly from an excellent autorial horror thriller to a cheap B-movie with angry ghosts throwing televisions into pools... The concept was great, inventive and intriguing, but it was not developed in the same way. Music was good, directing was good, photography was very good, nothing to point out from a technical standpoint but, as I said, this isn't enough to save a confusing and embarrassing script that doesn't show up immediately, but leaves you time to think the movie is good before ruining it to you.",5,0,2,15 November 2017
Million Dollar Baby," A soulpunch
","A heartbreaking experience, a film that literally punches you in the face, in all its sincere and genuine emotions. Eastwood's directing style is sober and clean, and the story is truly touching in its simplicity. The performances are outstanding, Swank in particular was born for the role, but all the actors did well.",8,1,2,14 November 2017
Event Horizon," Too confused and unfocused
","I have to say, this movie could have been way more intriguing and surprising If it just wasn't so badly written. Too much is left unexplained, and the whole movie is too disjointed : that's a pity because there were a few choices that I really appreciated, like Sam Neill's character slowly revealing himself as the villain, or the ending that leaves some sort of ambiguity with the last shot. The directing and the editing look fine most of the time, but during some scenes they drastically lower. Another missed opportunity",5,1,2,25 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A significant improvement
","We are finally far from the utter blandness and laziness of 'the force awakens', which was kinda painful to watch at times. This second chapter is definitely more fluent and rich, enjoyable even to me, who knows something about the saga but is far from being an hardcore fan
. The visuals are gorgeous, with bright reds and incredible palettes, the battles are epic, even if the story basically revolves around the usual schemes and some parts are weaker than others .I can see something popping out tho, there is a distinct identity that I missed in j.jabrams movie and that I gladly found in here.",7,3,13,15 December 2017
Avatar," 'Pocahontas'on Pandora
","Avatar is that kind of movie that heavily (if not entirely) relies on the visual entertainment and the inventive creation of an environment, but the plot is so incredibly unoriginal that without the huge support of visual effects, the whole film would be branded as horse****. It's 'Pocahontas' set in a sci-fi context, that's a pretty accurate comparison to make.",6,0,1,13 November 2017
The Shape of Water," A very simple yet heartfelt story
","7 +It's not Del Toro's best movie, but it's definitely still worth watching for many reasons : from a technical standpoint there's basically nothing to criticize, it really manages to drag the viewer into a sort of parallel reality, a world that is both familiar and fantastic, and the monster's look doesn't break the illusion cause it's so well done it won't look fake. Although the whole story doesn't add anything new to the genre, and it's a little too plain to be honest, all the characters manage to keep you interested in their development and overall look.
The message the movie delivers is heavy, but not heavily handled by the movie itself.",7,25,47,18 February 2018
Edge of Tomorrow," Original idea and exciting movie
","7 1/2The concept behind Edge of Tomorrow is pretty awesome, and this is by far the main reason of its success. The story that develops around it tho is not flawed but has a rather conventional scheme to it, which is not at all new to the alien invasion sub genre. Luckily, it has a good rhythm and a pleasant amount of humor. You won't get bored, that's for sure.",7,0,3,9 December 2017
12 Strong," A painful, annoying headache
","A considerable budget lost on an embarrassing film, with shallow dialogues and a clueless direction. The characters are paper-thin, the screenplay repetitive and predictable, and all the other technical aspects (except maybe the many bombings) are disappointing to say the least. I just came out of the theatre tired and angry for the two hours and twenty minutes I had lost.",4,2,3,15 July 2018
Arrival," A unique, entrancing experience
","8 1/2Villeneuve is a true master, his way of directing is steady and reasoned, yet it manages to convey so many emotions all the same. This movie makes no exception to that and adds to the technical beauty also a well-written script that is truly entrancing to follow. The whole concept is fascinating and original, makes the movie a work of art. The soundtrack is phenomenal",8,1,3,16 November 2017
Beowulf," A fascinating, gorgeous looking epic
","7 1/2Beowulf doesn't disappoint for the most part, delivering a mature and dark setting filled with demons and heroes broken by lust and desire for power. 
The graphics are still amazing to look at after more than ten years, and the score is definitely fitting.",7,1,1,19 March 2018
Annihilation," Not always solid, but still a worthy sci fi
","7 1/2Few times not wholly convincing, and more often not fully exploited considered its huge potential, Annihilation is still a pretty unique sci fi movie, both visually and conceptually. Only remorse the fact that I couldn't watch it on a movie theatre screen.",7,4,10,14 March 2018
