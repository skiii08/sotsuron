Blade Runner 2049," One Of The Worst Sifi Movies I Have Seen For A Long Time
","This is my first time I wrote a review for a movie on IMDb. I made the account for just reviewing this movie. I always check IMDb review and star rating for a new movie to decide to see it or not. The rating at the time I checked was 8.5. Boy I was wrong to trust the rating. This is one of the worst Sifi movies I have seen for a long time. The movie is long with little action. The plot is simple and boring. I was waiting for some excitement action scenes at the end. Something will make you say 'Wow', but nothing happened. At the end my friends said 'That's it'. What a waste $15 and time spending (I bought Ultra Screen ticket). I will never fully trust the review rating on this site.",1,9,20,11 October 2017
