It," Not as scary as the original
","This was a decent movie, but it wasn't as scary or realistic as the original in my opinion. In the original movie Pennywise becomes what you're afraid of, but in this version he is mostly himself, clown, and barely the things that scare the Loser Club. They seem as if they are trying too hard to make this movie scary. Also the actors seem like they're trying too hard to make their characters seem realistic. We don't connect as easily with the characters as we can with the original movie. In this movie we can already tell what's going to happen next there is no real surprise element in this movie. We could already tell that Billy's motives were to find his brother and simply that. And with Richie he seemed to be really obnoxious and he was really annoying. In the original movie the Loser Club seemed to be closer together than in this movie. It didn't seem as if they had each other's backs as much and like they were more conserved. I feel like the well house was unnecessary and was too much. It didn't add that creep affect as it should have. In my opinion it just made it obvious as to where Pennywise was.",5,1,2,30 April 2020
