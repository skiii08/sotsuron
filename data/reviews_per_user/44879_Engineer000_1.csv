It," A bland, torpid feature that has no spirit of the book or the original
","On IMDb, this movie could win the title of the 'Most Inflated Ratings of All time...ever'. I gave this movie 3 starts for some visuals and bold scenes in the beginning that quickly faded and stopped working only minutes into the movie.This film tries hard to copy the original, but fails to develop a story badly. The characters are boring and undeveloped, there is literally no character development there. A great deal of effort has been spent to bring more detailed visuals with intricate special effects, but alone, they do very little for the movie. Between these sequences of now boring special effects, we get a severely stretched and boring story that you just don't want to follow, because there is nothing to follow. The dialogue was poorly delivered.I really hate to say this, but this movie is complete and utter garbage.",3,41,83,11 September 2017
