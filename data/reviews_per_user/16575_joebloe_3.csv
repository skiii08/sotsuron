Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better the second time around
","For grownups, anyway, Phantom Menace is better the second or third time around.  The more oblique aspects of the plot ('taxation of trade routes'?  eh?) are more readily understood and, in fact, a plot emerges where the first time around it seems there isn't much of one.  Nor does the movie seem as flat, especially at the beginning.  (The first time round, Phantom Menace may seem like the world's most boring buddy movie for the first 30 minutes or so.)  And you start to notice many more details.  You start to see lots more of those cool robot racks.  You start to wonder things about the next two episodes. You begin to appreciate Jake Lloyd's performance more, especially the calculating squint that might grow into a perceptive gaze, or might rather become a dismissive stare.  Even Jar Jar becomes less annoying.  I think time will be kind to Phantom Menace.",Null,0,0,30 May 1999
The Mummy," Silly Fun
","The trailers were all wrong.  It's 'The Phantom' of mummy movies.  Or maybe even a little better.  In any event, it's a romantic comedy of the horror variety, lighter than even (for example) An American Werewolf in London.  Funny cute campy movie.  Good date movie if she has a sense of humor and didn't drag you to My Life as a Dog.",Null,0,0,2 March 2000
Gladiator," Spectacular and entertaining
","This exceptionally well cast and beautifully directed 2-1/2 hour spectacle nevertheless left me feeling vaguely unsatisfied.  It has neither the lyrical beauty of Last of the Mohicans nor the grit of Braveheart nor the deadpan violence of Private Ryan.  But on the other hand, it stands up well against all of the Roman epics of the 50s and 60s, including the somewhat (in retrospect) sillier Spartacus.  I felt like Gladiator had more to give but somehow it didn't.  I never really felt, watching the movie, 'WOW!  I need to see that again!'.Gladiator will cement Russell Crowe's 'serious yet accessible' actor status. Crowe will be beseiged with offers for the lead in the next 'Lethal Die Hard'. I kept trying to mentally rub the makeup off of Connie Nielsen to see if Annette Bening was hiding underneath.  I kept looking for James Mason and Patrick McGoohan.  Well, Mason's dead, so he would have been hard to cast.  (And where was Terence Stamp?  Oh, he was a senator in the last Star Wars movie.  Nevermind, that satisfies his 'senator quotient' for the time being.)  And surely there must have been a part for Patrick Stewart!The score was surprisingly bland and uninvolving.  Especially the Enya-esque themes used in the dream/hallucination sequences.  This is one area where Last of the Mohicans had it all over Gladiator.  You can be sure that any story holes in a Michael Mann movie will be patched over with wonderful music.Gladiator is solid entertainment.  It could have been more, but if nothing else, it means Ridley Scott is back to making good movies.  Now, let's hope his next move is back into science fiction or adventure, and not Thelma and Louise: The Next Chapter.",Null,0,0,8 May 2000
