Your Name.," I have to say it
","I don't think 'Your Name' is a bad movie. But for the life of me, I never understood how it has become so popular. As it grew in popularity, it became more and more frustrating for me everytime I say I didn't like it because it felt like I needed to defend my opinion. 'How could you not like this movie?' Well I'm not sure, I only saw it once and I couldn't force myself to watch it a second time to better understand the reasons of my dislike. I remember the gist of the story. And I remember my overall feeling of disappointment after seeing it. I thought it was clichÃ©, stereotypical, predictible and sometimes nonsensical (I'm not talking about the fantasy elements, just some of the characters reactions that felt absurd). I remember shaking my head many times throughout the movie. Of course, the animation is gorgeous, but i found nothing really poetic about the story and the jokes didn't land for me. I thought the characters were too one-dimensional (which I think was exactly the opposite of what the movie was going for, especially in terms of gender norms). But in the end, I wouldn't be able to pinpoint and tell you exactly what I didn't like about it, first because I don't remember it that well, and second because I feel like sometimes you just don't like things for no obvious reason.That said, I don't have anything against it, I just feel left out from everyone who absolutely loved this movie, to the point of crying while watching it. I really enjoy well-done traditional animation too, so I wanted to love this movie. Makoto Shinkai had been sold to me as the 'new Miyazaki', which I think is a weird connection to make (and I think even Shinkai agreed in an interview that it was absurd to call him that).In the end, I hope I'll have the strength to rewatch this movie one day, and maybe either change my opinion of it, or find out more specifically what I didn't like about it.",5,11,22,9 January 2020
Star Trek," As someone who got into Star Trek recently
","I can say I remembered this movie to be better. The first time I watched it, I had never seen anything Star Trek related. I only knew very few things about the lore and characters. At the time, I think I was pretty satisfied with my movie going experience, thinking it was a decent, fun action movie.Now, I've watched the entirety of the original series, I've seen movies 1 to 6 of the original timeline, and I'm currently going through 'the next generation'.I can say my opinion has changed.I don't think this movie is awful, but it felt pretty disappointing. It's not bad, just very, very bland and predictable. It's a pure Hollywood product.It certainly lacks that very specific vibe Star Trek usually has when it's done right. That 'je ne sais quoi' which made the original cast work so well. Of course, there's the disadvantage of not having eighty episodes to build the relationships between the characters. It is obvious you can't make your characters quite as likeable in a two-hour or so runtime.Kirk and Spock are also pretty different from the original show. It seems logical since this is a modern reinterpretation, they had to change some stuff along the way. Plus it's better that than having the actors trying too hard to be like Nimoy and Shatner, which could have been very forced. But once again, it does lack the charm of the original cast. However, I really liked karl Urban as McCoy, I think he really succeeds in acting like grumpy DeForest Kelley without it being forced. Also props to John Cho and Anton Yelchin (rest in peace) who were very good as Sulu and Chekov, and the rest of the cast who were very decent in my opinion.I liked the first scene with the USS Kelvin though, It was a tense and exciting opener, and worked better than most of the action sequences that followed.I know it's not entirely fair to compare the original show and this movie for many reasons, but even on its own, the movie lacks much in substance. I kind of felt disconnected from most of what happened, I very rarely felt the impact of the supposedly dramatic moments. I don't think it is such a bad idea to destroy Vulcan and kill Spock's mother, but it didn't shake me like it should have. And it's probably because a two-hour movie isn't enough to make us care about these characters. Maybe if they did it later in the series, idk.It is a great mystery to me how the first Star Trek movie from 1979 is rated 6.4 on Imdb, it had much more personnality in my opinion.The soundtrack was pretty cool though. The main theme for the movie is epic (but, I mean, coming from Michael Giacchino, it doesn't surprise me).(PS. Everyone and their mother has already said it, but could you chill with the lens flares J.J.?)",5,8,17,19 April 2020
1917," A good movie! But...
","I like 1917 well enough, I just think people are kind of overselling it just on the basis that the movie is one continuous uncut shot. I see how it is impressive and how it's a choice that makes sense, I just also think it's not enough to make it a masterpiece. A good movie, definitely. With gorgeous cinematography and efficient camerawork. With an enticing premise and some captivating action sequences. It just also felt kind of empty. Almost too smooth for a war movie. Something I also felt while watching Dunkerque.I'm definitely not hating though! I just wanted to add some nuance to my review. I think this movie had some heart. It just wasn't quite a masterpiece for me, just a good movie.",7,2,8,21 February 2020
Mulholland Drive," What the actual f
","I can't put all the pieces together, I felt this movie more than I understood it. But I can say that this is one of the greatest, most powerful experience I had as a spectator.I don't really know what to say. No movie has had me so shaken at the end.Putting into words what I just experienced would be a crime so I'll just leave it at that.",10,4,10,23 February 2020
