It," Tedious
","There is no sense of tension or any kind of drama in this pedestrian update of the 1990s TV mini series, The children's characters are underdeveloped clich√©s, from the bullies to the bullied { a fat boy, a boy who stutters, a boy who with asthma, a black kid, bla bla bla) The end of the 1980s setting, the homage to Stand by Me in small town America are the only redeeming qualities to this waste of effort. It just goes on and on without any of the excitement that this genre should bring. Occasional screaming, louder annoying music, and slamming doors are standard ingredients that are poorly and badly overused. Stranger things on Netflix did this far better!",2,7,11,10 March 2018
Troy," Daft
","I feel compelled to write to fellow IMDb.com users and tell them that if they have got half a brain cell, then they should avoid seeing this terrible, simplistic film. It has all the hallmarks of an epic (stellar cast, mega-bucks thrown at it, superb locations) but frankly, it fails to engage the viewer on any level.(unless you're a 12 year old girl drooling over Brad, Orland or Eric) Yes, the locations are lovely and the computer imaging spot-on but all of this is insignificant if there is nothing to absorb the viewer. I found the music overbearing and intrusive but most of all, it's the appalling script that floored me. It's just plain daft - full of witless pronouncements that scream their way to such obvious developments, that even scriptwriters of soaps would be ashamed. I lost count how many times I screamed out 'Oh Please!' Rubbish!",Null,0,2,13 November 2004
The Pianist," Why the fuss?
","Sorry guys but this film is rather OK.  Not great, not awful just OK - anyone else think the same?  My main criticism lies with Brody, too lightweight to carry such a demanding role that failed to excite any empathy apart from OK. Surely a leading character has to engender SOME emotion - be it love, hate, warmth, passion, fear, whatever - I just got the message that Brody was going through the motions - and that terrible flick of hair irritated too!  Sorry guys, POOH!",6,1,4,11 September 2003
The Holiday," yuck!
","What is the nonsense? Why are these 5 great actors in this utter drivel? The premise of two broken-hearted women (why not men?) getting over a relationship and amazingly both having a house available at exactly the same time to do a house swap is incredulous and suspends and defies belief. Oh yes, and then they find love!(Bless!) From then on,it's all downhill (with me so far?)I rate Cameron Diaz as a fine comic actress, Jude's a cracker as haunted man, Jack rocks and Kate, well what can you say about Kate? Why did she do this rubbish? It has no artistic merit or value. It's not even worth wasting a rainy winter's Sunday afternoon for. Really.!",2,0,2,9 January 2008
