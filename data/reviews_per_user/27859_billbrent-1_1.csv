Spartacus," The life of the Roman slave who almost toppled Rome
","In my opinion, no other movie has said so much about the values of freedom, courage, integrity, honesty, commitment and love than this movie; nor said it so well. Spartacus, played by Kirk Douglas, is a Roman slave who is sold to a gladitoral school - with the intent that he will some day fight and (most likely) die in the arena to entertain Roman citizens. He leads a revolt at the school and achieves freedom with the other gladitor/slaves. They build an army with the intent of fighting their way out of Rome and going back to the countries of their birth, where they will live as the free men they once were. His commitment to freedom, his loyalty to his friends, his love for Varinia (his wife, played by Jean Simmons) and his courage shine through ever moment of this magnificent film.",10,1,3,30 July 2004
