The Incredible Hulk," A good film but not really in line with the MCU
","I think the MCU is brilliantly thought out, and The Incredible Hulk is a good film on its own. They were just starting the MCU when this film was released - it was only the second film of the epic series (after Iron Man)Note I am reviewing this in 2018, 10 years on and Avengers Infinity Wars has just been released.As good as Edward Norton is, I was very dissapointed to see that in Avengers Assemble Mark Ruffalo's Banner is nothing like Edward Norton's - I realise different actors want to put 'thier mark' on a character, but when you're more-or-less the stepping off point for an epic collaboration of film franchises you should really have better continuation. How would it look if a new guy took the place of Chris Evans (Captain America) and appeared in the next film wearing a Union Jack?When a new film is released in the MCU I like to rewatch films relating to that franchise.
E.G. before I saw Thor Ragnarok at the cinema I rewatched Thor, Avengers Assemble, Thor The Dark World and Avengers Age of Ultron. Bruce Banner is a big player in Thor Ragnarok too, and I saw the two Avengers films as catching up on him at the same time.
But The Incredible Hulk was not on my list to watch - and it should have been.",7,0,0,2 May 2018
John Wick," An alright film but loud
","It was a good action film and I did really enjoy it, but where the action and the background music were loud the actors spoke too quietly, it was very confusing as I sometimes had to rewind scenes to hear what was going on.",6,1,4,10 February 2019
Rocketman," A good film, but not the film I was expecting
","How the story starts with Elton in rehab then goes back to the beginning as he tells his story was a similar style of storytelling to Bohemian Rhapsody which started and ended at Live Aid. I felt that the the storyline itself seemed a bit manic in places, but I think this helped portray the drug and alcohol problems that plagued him in those days.I liked how they linked the songs to the story, though they were not strictly in chronological order for Elton's life, they helped capture the events and feelings of what was happening on screen - although I think it seemed out of place when others joined in singing lines of some songs, as though they were written from their perspectives as well as from Elton's.
I liked throughout the film how they recreated Elton's outlandish costumes, showing clips at the end alongside real images to show how similar they truly were.I especially liked how they recreated the music video for I'm Still Standing with Taron Egerton at the end.For a film called Rocketman I had expected them to make a bigger deal of its namesake song, but as I left the cinema it was Yellow Brick Road playing in my head.This definitely is not a documentary of Elton Johns life, but I think it does capture what he was like back then, the trials he had to go through personally and professionally and while the film was not as good as I was expecting, it was enjoyable.",7,3,7,29 May 2019
Star Trek," Amazing film
","I didn't much enjoy The Original Series with William Shatner, but I thought this film was brilliant.
How they devised the 'alternate reality' was ingenious as it leaves all of the original TV series' and films intact and is the writers way of nodding with respect to everything that had come before.I think it allows people, like me, who did not grow up with The Original Series on TV to begin appreciating Star Trek where just watching Shatners series on DVD would not give the same energy as it had.",10,2,4,22 April 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Whats the point?
","Throughout this film that what I was thinking 'Whats the point?'
I had been made clear even before the film was released that it was the run-up to episode IV, and would end with Leia being captured on the Rebellion ship with the Death Star plans.
So going into this I knew how it would end, none of these characters have anything to do with the rest of Star Wars, so they'll either all die before the end or just fade into obscurity and so who cares.Also the CGI Tarkin and Leia looked very plastic, and after the CGI Schwarzenneger in the new Terminator film I know it can be better.
Strangely they also towered over everyone else, regardless of how the original actors had looked.I understand fans of the comicbooks etc will like it as they see comicbook characters on the big screen, but why not have done a sensible thing by going further back in time and making this a trilogy? Maybe that would have been better, there's no shortage of material.",1,0,2,17 December 2017
Captain Marvel," I was hoping for better
","Firstly I have to say I thought it was good that they changed the opening credits to footage of Stan Lee from the other films, a nice tribute, its sad to think that this will be his last cameo.It was an 'alright' film (I've seen better from the MCU)
The plot was a bit confusing until Campain Marvel (or Vers)'s memories were properly pieced together.It seemed very odd that at the start of the film Talos was trying to capture or kill Vers but at the house in Louisiana he was suddenly sedate and talkative.I don't see how the tesseract will go from the 'cat' to the chaple where Red Skull steals it, but shows how it ended up on Earth.I thought it was good how they made Samuel L Jackson look younger, and tied in how he lost his eye and named the Avengers.
And its nice to see Clark Gregg again.As I put in my review of Infinity Wars, 'Captain Marvel is basically there to fulfil the roles of a creature that won't show his green face anyway (Hulk), two dead men (Quicksilver and Vision) and someone who has been 'destroyed' by the soul stone (Scarlett Witch) it seems she is only there to ensure a victory for the Avengers'.
Captain Marvel seems to have infinite skills and powers, the list only continued to grow as the film progressed and she had no weaknesses.As a result she was almost boring to watch.I don't think Captain Marvel will be a good addition to the MCU, she would make the rest of them obsolete.",5,6,12,13 March 2019
Creed," Better than I expected
","It was undeniably a good film, the boxing stats that appeared with every new boxer on screen was a nice idea although it did become a bit too much of a fighter movie for my tastes.
I think the idea of following Apollos son and getting an elderly Rocky to train him was good as it built on the friendship and loyalty between Rocky and Apollo, but I don't like what they've done to Rocky; a fighter and believer has suddenly turned into a cynical old man, not even bothered to fight his own illness (yes the death of Paulie and Adrian, his only family we ever saw, would have messed him up in the head but it seemed unlike the Rocky we knew)
And the idea of an illegitimate son just besmirched the memory of a favourite character from four films, yes they needed a link to Apollo but couldn't they have found another way??The storyline was similar really to the original Rocky film, except instead of a nobody given a shot it was an up-and-comer.
And it can be argued that Rocky almost took the role of Mickey.As I said it was a good film and I do hope they make sequel, but maybe lighten up on Rocky's character",8,2,2,16 January 2018
Dead Poets Society," not up to the hype
","I watched this film because I was told it was a brilliant film, emotional and inspiring etc, and yes there are scenes when that all applied, but overall I was underwhelmed.The acting was good, although I would say I've seen Robin Williams do better.I got some of the messages it conveyed about life being short, think for myself and not conform with everyone else's ideals and to seize the day, but overall it failed to inspire me. I will go to work tomorrow feeling no different to how I did this morning, except for wishing that I had watched Good Will Hunting last night instead, because THAT is Robin Williams at his best.I must confess that after doing English Literature in school then retaking it in college for the grade (another 'D' by the way) I hate poetry.
Maybe somewhere in that statement IS part of Dead Poets Society?",3,0,4,7 March 2018
About Time," Not a good film
","I can't say I enjoyed the film, watching the same pattern throughout of doing/saying something wrong then going back in time to change what happened/what was said. It felt like watching Groundhog Day (2 stars FYI)
I don't enjoy watching the same scene of a film over and over again unless I press the rewind button.
The idea of if you go back before your child's birth it affects the child seems weird, I don't understand how changing something in your own life can affect an unborn child? Especially to the extend of changing the child's gender and hair colour as with Posy.From the start everything about it made me thing of the same film, About A Boy; the posh English accent Gleeson put on coupled with the constant voiceover made me think Hugh Grant.
If I had closed my eyes I'd swear it was Grant.And all I can saying about Bill Nighy was that he was just Bill Night, I haven't seen him in much but he's the same in everything.Not a great film and not one I'd recommend.",3,0,4,20 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," a good film but I thought it fell in places
","I thought this was a typical film ending for the 80's, the good guy always wins.But I thought the beginning seemed rather badly written if I'm honest.
Here Luke and Leia plan to rescue Han from Jabba on Tatooine.
Despite freeing Han the plan fails and is Leia captured, and when Luke appears he too is captured (and dropped into the Rancor pit to die) predictably Luke survives and kills the Rancor, then they are all sentenced to death at the Sarlac pit.
This however was all part of their plan as Lando, Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2 were already in place to help them and turn their execution into an escape.
What kind of a rescue plan is expected to fail from the start?
I can understand having a plan b just in case, but everything about this shows they knew exactly how events would unfold, why else would they place Lando, Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2 in Jabba's palace. How would they get them out if Han's rescue had been successful?Now a little controvential opinion, Ewoks.Han and his team go to destroy the shield generator on Endor in order to destroy the second Death Star, however before they can set charges to destroy the base an Imperial army then ambushed them and fight against the Rebels.
The fight soon turns to the Imperials advantage however the Ewoks then join the fight; using primitive catapults, trip ropes and stones they somehow defeat the Imperials and enable Han to destroy the shield generator.
The Ewoks seem like they were only placed in the film as a means of ensuring victory for the Rebels, the Imperials would have defeated the outnumbered Rebels were it not for them, and the idea that such primitive weapons could defeat the Imperial troops seemed a stretch anyway.Prior to this Luke left Hans team and allowed himself to be captured and taken to the Death Star to confront Palpatine and Vader where he is forced to fight Vader, Luke bests the Sith Lord however his compassion for Vader (after he revealed himself as his father) stops Luke from killing him. Instead he throws down his weapon and faces Palpatine unarmed.
Palpatine attacks Luke with his Force lightning however before he can kill Luke, Vader switchesd allegiance.
Driven by love for his son Vader lifts Palpatine and throws him down a chute into space and kills him, this act however damages his life support suit and soon after he too dies.
Vader seems like a very selfish man and an unreliable ally, having already turned on the Jedi in Episode III when he saw an opportunity to help himself (to save Padme) he again switches sides to save Luke.The Death Star is then destroyed, typically just as Luke escapes with Vaders body.
Luke then holds a private Jedi funeral on Endor attended by ghost Obi-Wan and ghost Yoda (the ghost of an old man then appears and is presumably Anakin) meanwhile everyone else has a pre-fight party in the Ewok village.
The remastered version is good how the head of the old man ghost is replaced with the head of Hayden Christiensen (who playes Anakin in the Prequel series, as this presumably depicts Anakin the last time he was a Jedi) But where is Qui-Gon who was hinted at being able to appear as a ghost to Obi-Wan while in hiding on Tatooine between the two trilogies?
In the remastered version they also show clips of worlds across the universe celebrating the destruction of the Emperor, which is odd since word cannot have spread that fast?",8,3,4,13 April 2018
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Simply a great film
","I'm not usually a fan of musicals, but this one is great - I've lost count of how many times I've watched it. Brilliant casting; Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter really work well together, as do Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall (all of them great actors/actresses separately but put together they're magic)
Then add the talents of Sacha Baron Cohen, Jamie Campbell Bower, Laura Michelle Kelly, Jayne Wisener and Ed Sanders instant hit.The soundtrack is brilliant, the whole music track is great at setting the mood of every scene, then the actual songs are great at telling a story while relaying the characters feelings and thoughts.
The set also is good - how they depicted London as it was back in the 1840's, but maybe darkening it up for the film which really works well.What I loved most of all is how they haven't just done the typical throat slitting, horror and gore fest that you think of when you hear the title, they tell the larger story, showing the betrayal of the corrupt judge and Sweeney Todd's descent into madness and the sad future that befalls his wife and child.
Then the attempted blackmail and murder of Sacha Baron Cohen that leads Sweeney Todd to his murdeous ways.This all somehow makes out mass murdering Sweeney Todd to be the victim of the film, and by the end I felt sorry for the character.
Tim Burton you're a genius.",10,3,4,19 February 2018
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A good film
","It was overall a good film although I thought there was far too many gushy romance scenes with Anakin and Padme.I liked watching how Palpatine played both sided in orchestrating the Clone Wars; using his apprentice Dooku to build the Confederate movement and turning them into a military threat, then influencing the Senate into giving him greater power within the Republic until he was able to instate the Clone army (having ordered their creation in secret years before)I thought The big fight scene with Dooku in the launch bay was cool (to a point.) when he started against Obi-Wan and Anakin it started well with Dooku using his force lightning to take out Anakin briefly and face Obi-Wan solo, but then I thought Obi-Wan was a bit feeble against the Sith Lord, and the minimal cut to his arm and leg seemed unlikely to disable him as much as it did.
The fight with Dooku and Anakin started well, it was a well choreographed fight and I enjoyed watching it, but clearly Anakin paused in the middle as Dooku posiitioned his lightsabre and swing to cut off his arm - it looked very unnatural and VERY staged.
It goes without saying that Dooku Vs Yoda was an epic fight.The War erupted thanks to Anakin ad Obi-Wan, both had been captured by the Confederacy and were about to be executed until the Jedi intervened and were faced by the Confederacy army.
With a perfectly timed arrival the Clones joined the fight and thus began the Clone War, with Palpatine pulling the strings on both sides.",8,0,1,13 April 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Excellent
","Rewatching this film on DVD I thought I'd flesh out my review.I still believe in my previous statement, this is a brilliant film that did great justice to a true legend!I have always liked Queen, I mostly listened to them when I was in school but never really knew anything about the band besides the typical trivia; names, songs, the fact that Freddie was gay and that he died of AIDS. But this film taught me so much more.It was an incredible story to watch how Queen was formed and their beginnings, how they developed their music and style. Freddie's relationship with the band members and with his manager/lover.
How Freddie was driven by Paul to leave Queen to make solo albums, but becomes trapped in a life of drugs, alcohol and orgies that Paul creates around him - it seemed Paul was drunk on Feddie's success and fame and dragged Freddie down with himI liked the reunion of the band and thier reaction to Feddie's revelation that he has AIDS, but also his inspiring decision to keep performing as he was born to do, keep writing songs and making albums (that we still love today)Rami Malek's performance was incredible and he deserves every accolade he received for this film.",10,1,2,7 March 2019
The Matrix Revolutions," They missed a trick
","They really missed trick, it was screaming them in the face and they went with this.
It is a good film, but here's how they could earn a tenth star.
At the end of Reloaded Neo found he could control the sentinels in the real world, they never really explained that one as they focused on Agent Smith and Neo being trapped in the Matrix.What they should have done is reveal the 'real world' to be another Matrix.
They can keep the multiple anomalies thing that the Architect explained, as it was logical thing and would be believable that the past anomalies hadn't discovered thier connection to the machines as Neo had done (as this discovery was only brought to light when he walked on the Earths surface to escape the Nebuchadnezzar before it was destroyed.Having a Matrix within a Matrix would seem to be a logical move by the Architect who said the problem is choice and that he strived for balance.Then Neo can start to push the boundaries of physics to manipulate this new Matrix and be the first to free people from this Matrix into the world beyond (and if you want another trilogy this too could be another Matrix forming an infinite regression.)",9,1,3,14 January 2018
X-Men: Days of Future Past," A bit of an awkward moment in the X-Men story
","The film was basically a feeble attempt to link the old Patrick Stewart generation of X-Men to the new James McAvoy breed, made apparent by the crossover scene where Stewart meets McAvoy.
I did like the new X-Men; Blink, Bishop and Warpath (although I couldn't really tell you what Warpaths power was except to see really far)
The new guy Sunspot was good but he seemed only a means of having an opposite for Iceman (in the previous films they had Pyro to do the same thing)It made no real sense in the storyline of Stewart's timeline; at no point in the previous films had they even hinted at the threat of Trask's machines, yet it apparently stated long before his time?
Are we supposed to believe too that Wolverine was brought back from Japan to the USA by Stewart and McEllen (at the end of the preceding Wolverine film) and thrust into a sudden war? A war that engulfed the entire world yet Japan (for the events of his last film) was completely ignored?And how did Stewart come back anyway, they never do reveal that big plot hole; last I saw Jean tore him apart at the atomic level, something only Wolverine himself could survive? He's a psychic not a healer.The ending too seemed odd, Wolverine had changed time and as expected only HE remembered the timeline before which is fine, but suddenly Jean and Cyclops were alive as though they were saying 'discard the previous films' (which to be honest is no great loss)
And showing Wolverine in the past being dredged out of the river by Mystique impersonating Stryker suggested a sequel with him joining McAvoy's lot which we know won't happen because throughout the film he haddn't yet been used by the real Stryker to give him his adamantium claws.",6,0,1,16 December 2018
Avengers: Endgame," A real dissapointment
","What a disappointing ending after a decade of films!I went into the film desperate to like it, and while it had a few twists and funny moments I was under impressed.The film starts on a ominous note, Captain Marvel flying through space to rescue Tony on his ship. Despite the ship being out of power, the food and air reserves used up, and being several lightyears from Earth, Captain Marvel 'carries' the ship back to Earth where Tony is alive and healed.So after Thanos has destroyed half the universes population he travels to 'The Garden' where the Avengers, or what remains of them, go to find him living in a shack; he was surprisingly easily defeated despite being so strong (even without the stones)
After they discover he's destroyed the stones and Thor murders him, they go about thier lives.Five years later it's interesting to see how they're doing; it's funny that Tony has escaped to the country and raised a family with Pepper (which he jokingly said he would do during Age of Ultron after seeing Clint's house)
I did like what Clint had become, a bit dark but really cool, I still says he's my favourite and deserves his own film.
I hate what happened to Thor, although it is understandable. Its interesting to see they made a New Asgard (but how did Meek, Valkyrie and Corg survive Thanos at the start of Infinity Wars?)I thought it was clever how they brought Ant-Man back, using the rat in the car impound after it was seemingly abandoned.Now here's where it really fell apart for me. Inspired by Ant-Mans story of the quantum realm, Tony and Bruce turn the quantum drive van into a time machine to test thier time travelling theory, and once its working they then suddenly gain a working time travel portal inside the Avengers headquarters?
But rather than going back to stop Thanos from using the stones they decide to split up to steal the stones from the past.Maybe they're right not to go back to stop him destroying half the universe because that would mean joining forces with thier previous selves during the battle in Wakanda, but what about intervening during the days between that event and Thanos destroying the stones?It is clever if they had to re-enact scene from previous films to fit with the story, but I felt this was only done to highlight that the stones have played a role in most of the previous film, which everyone knows anyway!?And going to events in the past let characters interact with people in the past that are gone; Thor spoke to his mother, Tony spoke to his father, Steve saw Peggy and many former Shield/Hydra agents then got to impersonate and fight himself, Banner got to speak to 'The Ancient One'.To sum up
Thor and Rocket went for the Reality stone/Aether during the events of Thor, the Dark World.Ant-Man, Steve and Tony went for the Mind and Space stones during the events of Avengers Assemble.
And when thier attempt for the Space stone failed Steve and Tony went to the army base where Steve was first trained in Captain America the First Avenger (although I think this will set some time after the film)Banner went for the Time stone, tagging along with Ant-Man, Steve and Tony during the events of Avengers Assemble.Clint and Natasha went for the Soul stone, technically this wasn't in any film until Thanos went to Vormir in Infinity Wars.It seemed rather presumptive here that Clint and Natasha both thought they were what the other loved most - Red Skull said that only sacrificing what you loved most would give the Soul stone, I knew they were friends but they were what each other love most? Natasha won the race to kill herself and Clint got the stone, presumably this is because he's already lost his family (everything he loved) but it is still very presumptive of Natasha.
If Cint had died what would happen? Last I heard Natasha loved Banner who is alive (more or less)(I would have liked to see Steve go for the Soul stone to encounter Red Skull)Rhody and Nebula went for the Power stone during the events of Guardians of the Galaxy.
I thought it was a very weak story how Thanos was able to see the future Nebula through the past Nebula, I realise she is the same person but how can they be that connected. As Rhody returns to his time they disable and capture Nebula.
It was clever that the past Nebula took her time travel gear to impersonate her future self.With all six stones together Banner uses thier own gauntlet (how did they get that? The last one had to be made by the Dwarfs on Nidavellir?) and everyone who is destroyed by the stone comes back - except Gamora and Natasha (as they were sacrificed to the Soul stone to aquire it I had thought they'd come back too?)When the past Thanos was then brought to the future by the past Nebula it began as a good fight scene - I thought giving Thor his new hammer/axe Stormbreaker stifled him in Infinity Wars, but now they had stolen Mjolnir from the past and he had both!
Then even more incredulously Steve was able to wield Mjolnir (he was 'unworthy' of Mjolnir during Age of Ultron. Since then he has become a rogue agent and is considered a criminal yet this made his worthy? Now there's a bad message to send out)
Steve even uses Mjolnir to summon lightning, I thought that was Thors power? Mjolnir is just a tool to focus that power!! Odin said so!!As before however thier combined efforts are no match for Thanos and he summons his army to destroy them. Then comes the cheesy heroic moment as a portal opens and Black Panther walks out from Wakanda, with Sam flying past and all those who were 'destroyed' there.
From another portal Dr Strange then emerges from Titan with the others who were destroyed there.
Suddenly hundreds more portals open as the Wakandan army emerges, and an army of sorcerers lead by Wong, and an army of Asgardians lead by Corg and Meek (followed by Valkyrie riding a Pagasus)
To complete the medley Ant-Man suddenly breaks through the wreckage as a giant to bring Banner, Rocket and Rhody to the fight (by his own admission Ant-Man cannot sustain that size for long, and has to rest afterwards so how does he stay like that?)Honestly I wouldn't be surprised to see a Ravenger army lead by Stallone!!The huge battle then commences with Clint, and Spider-Man trying to get the Gauntlet with the stones away. I would have liked to see Wasp do more in the fight.As Thanos orders his ship to fire down on the battleground, hitting his own men and the Avengers, Captain Marvel arrives and destroys the ship by crashing through it several times.
I am relieved that this is her first appearance in a while as she says she's been off world as every other planet is also dealing with thier loss after Thaos destroyed everything.As I said in my review of Captain Marvel film, she's almost boring to watch as she has no weaknesses and would make the others seem redundant.As Thanos manages to get the gauntlet with the stones the Avengers attack him with the same outcome as before.
In what I thought would be Thanos' downfall he was surprising able to fight off Captain Marvel (so she DOES have a weakness) then Tony switches out the gauntlet with the stones with Thanos' old broken gauntlet.
Clicking his own fingers Tony uses the stones to destroy Thanos and his army, except that it kills him too.After Tony's funeral and everyone has gone back to their normal lives (Thor meanwhile leaves with the Guardians of the Galaxy and makes Valkrie the Queen of New Asgard), Banner tasks Steve with returning the stone to thier place in history where they got them (because 'The Ancient One' said there would be consequences if he didn't)
Something that later occurred to me, the Space and Mind Stones (when they took them in the past) were inside Loki's staff and in the Tesseract which both had to be broken to obtain the Stones. So how did Steve return them?After returning the Stones Steve doesn't come back, instead an old man sitting on a bench nearby (who must have been there all the time?) reveals he is Steve and that he stayed in the past to live out his life as if he had not been frozen.
He then gives the Captain America shield to Sam and it cuts to a scene of him in the past with Peggy.Not the ending expected, and bit overly complicated. But as Tony, Steve and Natasha are gone will there be a new team in the future? And will Thor and Banner return?",6,1,7,28 April 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," A good film and worthy of the MCU
","I saw Avengers Infinity War at the cinema and thought it was a brilliant film and a really good addition to the MCU collection.I have been a fan of the MCU since it began with Iron Man in 2008, and after 19 films the only one I have disliked is Dr Strange.
I liked the character of Dr Strange but the film itself just got weird with the buildings turing on thier head and everything spiralling around them.Dr Stange is himself a good addition to the MCU, and putting him with the rest of the Avengers kept him more 'grounded' (for lack of a better word) than if he were alone or with other magical beings.
One thing that I thought was strange is that he had an infinity stone yet never used it? During that fight with him, Iron Man, Spider-Man and the Guardians Vs Thanos, how much easier would it have been if he had simply frozen time?
Ok he used it once to see all the possible futures, and claims there was only one in which they win. But he clearly saw something else that he kept to himself because he was quick to surrender the stone to save Stark.I was dissapointed that one of my favourite originals - Hawkeye - was missing (and why hasn't he had his own film yet? He more than deserves it) there is a reason I'm sure but it's still dissapointing.
And as a relative new-comer I had expected to see Ant-Man in the mix.
And on this note what happened to Korg, Meek and Valkryie? They were on the Asguardian refugee ship with Thor, Loki, Hulk and Heimdall at the end of Thor Ragnarok so where did they go?I thought how Iron Mans suit had evolved with Wakandan nano technology was a good touch as it showed how Wakanda was intergrading itself into the world, but I thought they went a little over the top with it: turning his arms into swords and hammers etc almost instantly seemed a bit too much (it was almost like watching the fight scene between Peter Quill and a Ego in Guardians of the Galaxy 2 when a giant rock Ego attacks a rock Pac Man) and the extra weapons that sprout from his back to hover at his sides just seems implausible.
Both Black Panther and Spider-Man's suit were also using the same nano technology but couldn't do that, so why do it to Iron Man?I liked Spider-Mans new suit, it looked really cool; they had hinted at this suit at the end of Spider-Man Homecoming and it was great to see it in action. I liked the spiders legs that sprout from his back, reminiscent of the spider suit Peter Parker has in some Spider-Man games I've played, but where was the A.I. KAREN of his previous suit? I hope this new suit doesn't mean she's gone (hopefully it's like JARVIS and FRIDAY, whereby she continues in whatever suit he wears)I thought they went wrong with Thor.
In Thor Ragnarok they let him explore his true powers after Mjolnir was destroyed by Hela, but suddenly they have back-peddled and gave him a new hammer/axe - Stormbreaker.
I see why they wanted Thor to go to Nidavellir, to show that the same dwarfs that created Mjolnir also made Thanos' gauntlet, and therefore hint at its power, but I thought how they tied Thor down to another hammer/axe stifled him.
I didn't really get how a small hammer/axe has the same power as the bifrost, where does it draw its power for a start?All that aside it was good to see him using Stormbreaker it the big fight on Earth, and he did use his new-found powers to a degree, but I would have liked to see him build on the power he had unlocked at the end of Thor Ragnarok more, and they were quick to ditch the eyepatch.Why was Black Widow suddenly blonde, what is the point of that? I did like the fight scenes with her and the Wakandan Captain Vs Thano's followers.I thought having Paul Bettany looking like himself over Vision was a good touch, it had been shown in Captain America Civil War that he was starting to evolve and develop human traits, so showing him with a proper human form seemed right, but he was only like that for a short time, then for the rest of the film he remained in the robot form he'd always been which was a shame.I thought how they retained the personality of the Hulk (which they established in Thor Ragnarok) was good, giving him the ability to control himself in not allowing Bruce Banner to bring him out, then allowing him to communicate with Bruce.
By not having the Hulk and giving Bruce Banner the 'Hulk Buster MKII' suit was an excellent idea, it gave the team the power and strength of Hulk, a nod to Iron Man (who was absent from the fight as he was on Thanos' planet) and we got to see more of Bruce than in previous films where usually the Hulk would take over.Sticking loosely to the Hulk, it was weird how suddenly Heimdall is able to summon the power of the bifrost to sent Hulk to Earth (but then how else would he have got back) but if he could do that why not also save Thor, Loki and himself at the same time? And how are we only seeing this in him now after 3 Thor films?
I will say I was sad to see Heimdall executed.I thought it was sad when Loki was killed by Thanos, but it did inspire Thor to fight back - and honestly we've seen Loki 'die' in nearly every film he's been in, so I wouldn't be surprised to find him alive somewhere down the line.
Thanos did make a mocking comment about 'no more ressure ting' but I don't believe that.It was good to finally see the Guardians of the Galaxy properly intergraded with the Avengers, although I was very sad to see Gamora 'die'.
Spider-Mans references to films continued in this film, and how he and Peter Quill talked about movies I thought helped to cement the Gaurdians with the Avengers.I liked the cameo by Red Skull, I didn't think he had just died at the end of Captain America The First Avenger, so it is good that we got closure by seeing his fate.Nick Fury's scene at the end was really only there to give a link to the MCU's next big character - Captain Marvel.
Having not read the comic-books I'm not fully familiar with all the characters, but from what I've read online Captain Marvel has superhuman strength, durability and speed, she can fly and is able to project and absorb energy.
Not that I'm against Captain Marvel, but she is basically there to fulfil the roles of a creature that won't show his green face anyway (Hulk), two dead men (Quicksilver and Vision) and someone who has been 'destroyed' by the soul stone (Scarlett Witch) it seems she is only there to ensure a victory for the Avengers.I say 'destroyed' with quotation marks against Scarlett Witch because, also from reading online, people 'destroyed' by the soul stone are presumably retained inside the stone, and can be resurrected from it should the bearer choose.
So it's possible that everyone 'destroyed' by Thanos with the stone could be resurrected later; as too with Gamora who was sacrificed by Thanos in order to claim the soul stone - and her survival was hinted at further by her child self appearing to Thanos (presumably she appeared as her child self because that is how Thanos always remembered her)And we all know that eventually that HAS to happen; they already announced that there will be another Spider-Man film, so he must return.
There is likely to be another Guardians film so that's Peter Quill, Gamora, Mantis, Groot and Drax to come back (otherwise who's left? Rocket and Nebula) this would also apply to Black Panther and Dr Strange.
Assuming the absent Hawkeye survived Thanos' universal mass-exodus, none of the original Avengers were destroyed. Very curious, I don't see yet how Iron Man can get back from Thanos' world as he was left there alone, but are we going to see an original team reunion?This was a very good film, but the mass-exodus the end (that we already know wouldn't last) did lose the film a star in my opinion.",9,4,12,29 April 2018
Back to the Future Part III," A good time travelling film
","The first films said you shouldn't change the past or the future, and it was good after the events of the first two films that Doc wants to destroy the time machine.
Marty instead going back in time to save Doc showed his loyalty to his friend, and having the 1955 Doc help him was a good time traveling twist.Clara was a good twist, considering the first film you'd assume that removing someone from thier own time could unpredictability affect the timeline but the fact that Clara, on the moment of her appearance on screen, should have died meant she could leave her time with no effect on the timeline.As before why are the years always in multiples of five? 1985, 1955, 2015 now 1885. There are other years.Despite the destruction of the time machine, Doc's new steam engine time machine, together with Doc and Clara's children, give them the potential for a fourth sequel.
And the fact that they named the children Jules and Verne (after thier parents' favourite author) could hint at a potential storyline wherein, to exploit the timeline for thier own gain, the boys could sell Jule Verne's novels (combing thier names to become the author thier parents love)",10,0,0,15 December 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," First we had the Episode IV plagiarised, now it's Episode V's turn
","Well The Last Jedi was better the 'The Farse Awakens' (see my review of it to understand), but it wasn't great.
Where Episode VII was a rehash of Episode IV with elements of the other films thrown in, this was very similar to Episode V with elements of the other films thrown in.At the beginning of the film the Resistance are escaping from a base after the First Order have discovered them (how did Episode V begin again?)
Poe then launches a one man assault on the Dreadnought so that the Resistance bombers could destroy it.Lumbering and slow as they are, four of the Resistance bombers are destroyed and only one reaches its target. But predictably for the Star Wars franchise, and rather dubiously, that one bomber is enough to to destroy the Dreadnought.
So why did they send five in the first place?This is very close to using the ion cannon on Hoth to disable the Imperial ships, it had the same effect of distracting them as the main ships escaped.The Resistance escape but the First Order track them through hyperspace and are right behind them (which everyone says is impossible, but they did it, but they can't, but they did? They never really did explain that one, yet they knew how to stop them?)The First Order fighters then attacked the Resistance ships and with Kylo's piloting skills (that could rival Anakin Skywalker in Episode III) he destroyed the Resistance ships hanger to stem any defence.But when Kylo has a chance to destroy the main ships bridge he hesitates because mummy is on it. So his escorts do it for him.We then see Leia dead and floating in space, but somehow she wakes up and floats back to the ship, even opening the sealed airlock door from the outside and then collapses. Now THAT was complete nonsense.Her next in command then assumes control but seemingly does nothing.It then became a boring game of 'keep away' between the Resistance and the First Order. Meanwhile Finn and the new girl, Rose, went off to find a way to stop the First Order.I should add here I'm really glad that Kylo ditched that ridiculous mask.Meanwhile on Luke Skywalker's island, the once plucky optimistic good guy has turned into a crusty old cynic who hates the Jedi. After several days of pestering him, Luke agrees to train Rey (if only to show her why the Jedi should end) but during her training Luke is scared off when Rey shows the same level of strength as Kylo had.Rey discovers a cave on the island that is strong in the dark side. As curiosity gets the better of her she enters the cave, and through some nonsense with mirrors she thinks she will see her parents, but only sees herself (anyone familiar with Episode V should have known how that would end, it's an obvious rehash of the cave on Dagobah)Luke then refuses to help Rey and save the Resistance, so she leaves him sort of like Luke leaving Yoda to go to Han and co on Cloud City.On a side note, Skywalker island was overrun by these weird alien creatures, which seemed as irrelevant as most other animals in the previous trilogies. I was told the real life reason for these was to disguise the puffins that occupied the island they filmed on, but once they were off Skywalker island why were there still animals on the Millenium Falcon? Did puffins stow away in the props?At least before they had a justifiable reason for having them.Now to Finn and Rose.
They go to a planet to find a code breaker to stop the First Order, and are sent to a casino filled with aliens gambling and watching big horses with Yoda ears race around a track (I'm reminded of the bar in Episode II when they're hunting for the bounty hunter Zam)They are caught by the police for illegally landing thier shuttle on the beach, and in prison they encounter a man who claims to be a code breaker and can stop the First Order.
Finn and Rose escape prison and are hunted by guards, they are saved by the man they met in prison and everyone returns to the Fist Order and Resistances game of 'keep away', and using some trickery with the First Orders shields they board the lead ship.Disguised as officers (just like in Episode IV when Luke and Han disguised themselves as Storm Troopers) they go to disable the tracker.Aboard the Resistance vessels they are slowly losing power and one-by-one they're falling behind and the First Order destroy them until only the lead ship remains. Still it seems like Leia's replacement is doing nothing, so Poe leads a mutiny, but it ends quickly when Leia wakes up and sides with her assistant.
She reveals to Poe that there was a plan all along, an old unrecorded Rebellion base was conveniently located nearby and they all escape on shuttles to get there; all except Leia's assistant who remains on the lead Resistance ship.However Snoke knows the small ships are escaping, so the First Order start destroying them and ignore the lead Resistance ship all together.It's about now that Rey arrives, launching herself in an escape pod from the Millennium Falcon and easily glides onto the First Order ship, somehow ignoring the shields that Finn and co had to disable to pass through.
Rey then allows herself to be taken prisoner by Kylo and taken to Snoke (it's Luke, Vader and Palpatine in Episode VI recreated perfectly)
And as in Episode VI Rey convinces Kylo that there is good in him, and he kills Snoke - at least the red suited guards do something about it this time, they were curiously absent when Palpatine was killed.We finally got to find out who Reys parents are. They're nobodies who sold her for gambling money? When Luke said she was as powerful as Kylo I had expected her to be a Skywalker? It's what I had thought all along - abandoned by daddy Luke because he went into exile on Skywalker island.
Guess I lost that bet.Kylo then does what Vader had planned for Luke in Episode V, he tries to get Rey to join him so they can rule the Galaxy as father and son (wait that WAS Vader and Luke, it's all too similar)
And like Luke, Rey says no and escapes, Kylo then returns to being the bad guy and takes command of the First Order in Snoke's place.Now back to Finn, thier unnamed code breaker and Rose. Just as they get through the security door to the tracker the trio are captured by the First Order soldiers who somehow were already behind the locked door?
And before they're sentenced to death, Finn and Rose discover that the code breaker had turned them in for a big reward (which they should have seen coming after he tried to extort money out of them for his help)Meanwhile, the First Order are still destroying the small Resistance shuttles, so Leia's assistant decides to fight back, she turns her ship around and activates hyperspeed towards the First Order ships; the Resistance ship cuts through the First Order and destroys them.
The subsequent damage allows Finn and Rose to escape thier execution and finally Captain Phasma gets to do something; although she dies rather easily, and in a weird move BB-8 drives an AT-ST to help get them to a shuttle to escape.Finn and Rose reunite with the Resistance in the old Rebellion base.
Now if the first planet wasn't enough to resemble Hoth, the First Order attack on AT-AT walkers while the Resistance have pre-dug trenches and weapons platforms.
Then the pilots come, not flying proper snow speeders as on Hoth, but really bashed up pieces of junk. Against AT-ATs and tie fighters? No chance.
And as you'd expect they lose an retreat into the base.Back to Skywalker island.
Luke firmly believes the Jedi should end and threatens to destroy the treehouse containing the Jedi books, but he hesitates when ghost Yoda appears. Seeing Luke hesitate ghost Yoda destroys the treehouse for him and helps Luke to regain some of his hope.
They finally get Luke back to his old self, and he uses the Force to project himself in the Resistances base and face Kylo Ren.The AT-ATs attack but Luke emerges unscathed (because he's just a projection) then in a very Episode IV moment, Luke faces Kylo and lowers his weapon for Kylo to kill him, but he's just a projection so can't die, but his ruse allows the surviving members of the Resistance to escape aboard the millennium falcon.They then show Luke on his island just in time for him to complete the Episode IV reference and disappear as Obi-Wan had.
I hope this doesn't mean Episode IX will have a cynical pessimistic ghost Luke Skywalker.I think between this film and the previous barrel of tripe they have plagiarised Episode IV and V pretty completely, I expect Episode IX will have a somehow bigger more dangerous super weapon/planet.
And I'm sure they'll find a modern version of the Ewoks.",2,9,12,30 April 2018
Jurassic World," The film started so promisingly, but it went very wrong
","I thought Jurassic World started on a good premise; the original film showed the park fail before it opened, but this film showed a successful park at its peak.
And like any theme park, the managers focussing on analysis score and rating etc and typically pushing for anything to raise its performance.The science of the park led them into genetic engineering, an area they had touched on in the original film as they had completed genetic codes with that on amphibians. But here they ran with it more, using modern techniques to create a dinosaur, the indominus rex.As in the original Jurassic Park, and a theme that was continued in part by both sequels, the film focused on two children who were related to the main operator of the park (Mr Masrani was basically an investor, not the one who ran the park)I liked the ideas behind the training of the raptors, building on the underlying premise of Jurassic Park 3 that raptors were smart creatures and, as is human nature, the military were looking to use that to thier advantage.I though how they set the raptors loose to hunt the indominus rex was a bit predictable, as was the fact that it was part raptor itself and they joined with it to fight/hunt the humans. How did they not see that coming?I thought how the raptors turned against the indominus rex seemed a bit out of place, yes they probably were closer to Owen as he had raised them, but for lethal pack hunters it seemed a bit implausible.
Predictably, and naturally, the indominus rex was winning the fight (it was bigger and stronger with more teeth) and eventually only one raptor remained.When Clare went to get the tyrannosaur to fight the indominus rex it seemed very odd, a big predator and the main 'villain' of two previous films suddenly easily controlled? Unlikely
I realise it had received some training itself with the flare leading to food, but why didn't it try to eat Clare as she was holding the flare?With the tyrannosaur in the fight the film turned very poor, I can see what they were trying for - nature vs genetic creation - but what they got was a rather pathetic 'tag team' whereby two dangerous predators worked together to fight the indominus rex, leading it to the pool where the mosasaurus finished it off.
Then to add insult to injury the tyrannosaur and raptor shared a 'knowing look' before going their separate ways, it was very cheesy and I was half-expecting them to high-five.The ending seriously let this film down, a film that started so promisingly.",3,0,1,22 April 2018
Avatar," A work of art, but predictable
","It was undoubtedly a brilliant set, the amazing detail that had gone into everything on Pandora; the plant life, the animals and the Na'vi themselves. It was beautiful how they showed the luminescent plant life in the night and the details of the daytime planets.I just wish they'd spent more time on the plot, it was too predictable for my liking.
As soon as they explained the premise of 'driving' the avatar bodies I had figured out the plot; the main character would integrate himself with the natives using his avatar body, fall 'in love' with the native people, then switch allegiance's as they fought off the invading human army who the main character had worked for, naturally they would win and he would stay with the natives on Pandora when everyone else left.How they transferred his mind from his human body into his avatar body was inventive and something I hadn't considered, and Sigourney Weaver's death was a plot twist which didn't really affect the story but came as a surprise.",7,0,0,13 April 2018
How to Train Your Dragon," A good film
","It was a good film but I though it lost its way part way through; at the start Hiccup shoots down Toothless and breaks part of his tail, over time he developed a tail fin controlled by a foot pedal that enabled him to fly.
I loved the scenes of Hiccup and Toothless learning to work together to fly and perfecting the fin and pedal mechanism, then when Hiccup lost his cheat sheet he instinctively was able to control the fin and the two flew together perfectly.Then they get discovered by Astrid, but before she can get back to the village to expose them, Hiccup and Toothless catch her and strand her in a tall tree to talk.Here the film looses the plot, rather than returning Astrid to the ground, Toothless rockets into the sky with a series of loops and rolls.
Such activities earlier in the film were impossible without Hiccup to control the tail fin, Toothless couldn't even take off on his own! And it is very unlikely that Hiccup helped with his flying as he told Toothless to return to the ground gently.Throughout the film Toothless became able to fly more and more without Hiccups input; flying to the dragon island and into thier nest, then later he flew into the village to save Hiccup in the arena cage.",8,0,0,18 February 2019
American Made," I liked it
","A good film but very complicated, trying to remember all the different names and locations, it was useful how occasionally Tom Cruise gave a summary of everything he was doing and the occasional clips of the videos he made at the end of the film helped too.
I can't say I thought much of his accent (and when he was giving the summary of the Cold War on the cartoon map the accent seemed to disappear entirely for some unknown reason?) but the overall acting was good; it was good that there was no 'running scene ' that Tom Cruise has become synonymous for in his past films.
Definitely one to watch again",8,1,1,30 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," a good film but Palatine has lost his evil side
","Episode III depicted Anakin's final descent to the dark side, the culmination of Palpatine's plans for the previous two films (maybe not the intended plot of the film but I think Palpatine is the best character of the Original and Prequel series)It was a good film up to point, I can't say I care for the gushy romance scenes with Anakin and Padme.The fight scene at the start with Dooku was very good.
As in Episode II Obi-Wan was very feeble against Dooku as he was too easily bested by the Sith Lord and pinned under the fallen platform (which curiously did no damage?)
The fight against Anakin was again perfectly choreographed and Dookus defeat did not seem at all staged or implausible as in Episode II when Anakin lost his hand.Anakin and Obi-Wan are then separated by their roles in the ongoing Clone Wars, and Palpatine makes his final moves to turning Anakin. He slowly reveals himself to be a Sith Lord, first by introducing Anakin to the idea of studying the dark side - using Anakin's insecurities in his social life to confuse him further (specifically his dreams about Padme's death).
If Anakin had had his wits about him, he'd have caught the hint at his own heritage.
A Sith Lord capable of influencing the medicloreons to create life, and since Episode I it was known that Anakin was conceived by medicloreons - but he's too self-centred and sees only his own uses for the powers being described.Then Palpatine fully reveals himself as a Sith Lord, which Anakin reports to the Jedi Council as Palpaine knew he would. However Anakin interrupts Mace Windu as he was about to kill Palpatine, (as Palpatine expected, knowing the temptation of the dark side powers was too irresistible) Anakin saves the Sith Lord and in doing so causes Windu's death.For a toughened Jedi Master, Windu did make a scene about loosing his hand - we have seen a lot of people losing limbs in Star Wars (Darth Maul was completely sliced in half an Episode I, Anakin lost a hand and part of his arm in Episode II, Dooku lost both hands earlier in this film, Anakin looses his other arm and both legs later in this film, Luke lost a hand in Episode V, and Anakin/Darth Vader's robotic hand is cut off in Episode VI)
But no-one made as much noise about it as Windu did.But back to Anakin and Palpatine. This too was part of Palpatines plan to turn Anakin; knowing he would be too distraught to turn to any Jedi after that betrayal, making Palpatine his only choice.Anakin then helped Palpatine destroy the Jedi Order as he had wanted all-along, thus allowing him to reorganise the Republic into a Galactic Empire. Palpatine then even turns the Republics army, the Clones, against the Jedi while continuing the war.As he has been playing both sides, Palpatine brings the war to a sudden end and to ensure there's no uprising he sends Anakin to kill the other leaders of Dookus Confederacy.Not to the Jedi.
Having escaped the 'Jedi purge' Yoda faces Palpatine, however is defeated and chooses to go into exile. Meanwhile Obi-Wan faces Anakin.And here's where the film fails in my eyes:
Anakin and Obi-Wan fight in a long battle which ends with Obi-Wan cutting Anakin's arm and legs off and abandoning him to burn to death on Mustafar. That bits fine.
But then Palpatine then comes to Mustafar and saves Anakin from an otherwise certain, and painful, death and outfits him with a life support suit.By this point Anakin had fulfilled his role in Palpatine's plan, therefore like Dooku and Darth Maul before him, Anakin should have been thrown aside - yes this would mean that as Obi-Wan and Yoda where the only other force-users it is unlikely Palpatine could get a new apprentice, but the Empire is his and the Jedi are defeated, so why would he need another apprentice anyway?
Palpatines compassion for Anakin weakened his character and showed him to be not as evil as he should be for a Sith Lord.Palpatine then tells Vader that Padme has died because of him. Saving Padmes life had been the underlying reason for Anakin turning to the dark side, so his despair at her death sealed him to Palpatines side.Palpatine then goes ahead with turning the Republic into an Empire and reforms the Clone army into an Imperial army with Vader at its helm.
Palpatine had shown in the past two films, and again here, that his true strengths were in politics so giving Vader command of his military, thus free himself to manage the Empire, was a smart decision.",8,0,0,13 April 2018
Back to the Future Part II," A good film
","A good film, and a good idea to go ahead in time when the original went backwards, but why are the years always in multiples of five? 1985, 1955 now 2015. There are other years.I thought it was a bit hypocritical that the opening premise of the film was to stop Marty's son joining Griff in a robbery that would see him in jail, which would lead to Marty's daughter in jail too after a failed breakout.
They made it quite clear that you shouldn't know too much about you own future, and they knocked out Jennifer for this reason, but why were they there in the first place if not to break the same rule?I did like the following events whereby Biff changed his future using the time machine to go back in time to cheat at gambling, and then seeing the effects of these changes when Doc and Marty returned to 1885.
I enjoyed how Doc and Marty then had to go back in time again to repair the timeline, coincidentally the same time and place in which the first film took place so Doc and Marty had to evade thier former selves (a shame they hadn't thought ahead more in the first film and had someone (or the actors themselves) to play thier future selves)",10,0,1,15 December 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," one word sums it up, plagiarism
","It's like they just took the story of Episode IV, tweaked it in places, moved a couple of bits around and stuck in bits from the rest of the Original and Prequel series, then thought 'they'll never know'
Well, we did.Let's start from the beginning.Rey is abandoned on a desert planet as a slave and grows up making a living as a junk dealer.
Luke was left with his aunt and uncle on a desert planet (not the same planet but very similar) and made to do similarly menial work and deal with junk dealing Jawa's.
And the slave thing is just a throw-back to Anakin Skywalker in Episode I, then add in that Anakin was owned by the junk dealer Watto.Then an old man on the same planet gives the Resistance pilot (Poe) a segment of a map to Luke Skywalker; thanks to him the First Order appear on the planet and through some space battles a First Order defector (Finn) encounters Rey who helps her to escape the planet aboard the Millennium Falcon.
Here they also meet Han Solo and Chewbacca.
Firstly 'Resistance' is a title given to those who fight AGAINST the people in power, yet they fight FOR the people in power.
Secondly the name 'First Order' is stupid and makes no sense.
The old man, Poe and Finn are basically the equivalent of Obi-Wan in this story, as each fulfil roles Obi-Wan had played with Luke.Han, Rey and co then travel to find a weird alien creature in a bar of aliens whereupon the First Order attacks and the Resistance save them.
I'm reminded of the cantina scene on Tatooine (only without the music) and as for the alien creature it might as well be called Yoda.Rey however is captured by the First Order (led by Kylo Ren) and is taken to the First Orders super weapon where Rey discovers her connection to the Force and begins experimenting with her abilities.
Meanwhile the First Order use their super weapon to destroy the New Republic's governing worlds, and Kylo talks about Rey with his master Snoke.
Just like Luke when he started discovering his connection to the Force and began training with Obi-Wan, the only difference being that Rey has no one to help her. Then you get the Jedi Mind Trick on the Storm Trooper, a force power that Obi-Wan had used on Storm Troopers in Episode IV.
Then there's the First Orders super weapon; it's basically a Death Star built inside a planet, but for what purpose? And the test firing, all I can say is Alderaan.A quick look at the new bad guy 'Kylo Ren' - a boy trained as a Jedi who turned to the dark side and wears a black suit with a mask that changes his voice (too many similarities to Darth Vader to be comfortable, and they really rub it in when he 'prays' to Vader's mangled helmet. At least Darth Vader's mask had a point to it)
And then there's his master Snoke, a weird man with a messed up face who appears as a giant hologram - just as Darth Sideous appeared to Darth Vader in Episode IV.Han, Chewbacca and Finn launch a rescue mission to save Rey while the Resistance plan to destroy the super weapon.
Han, Chewbacca and Finn infiltrate the super weapon and, while searching for Rey, they encounter Captain Phasma and use her to access the computer and dump her down a garbage chute.
Basically Captain Phasma here plays the role of R2-D2 when he accessed the Death Star computer to find Princess Leia in Episode IV, then the garbage chute is just an unnecessary throw-back to the same film.
What's the point of Captain Phasma anyway? A Storm Trooper in a full silver suit whose only role is walking around and talking?Han and Chewbcca then lay charges to destroy the shield generator for the Resistance to attack the super weapon.
Where did they get that idea I wonder, oh wait that's how they destroyed the second Death Star in Episode VI.As they finish planting the bombs Han faces Kylo and reveals he is his father, then Kylo kills him.
It's Episode V in reverse. And Han's death isn't that much of a shock when you think about it, they killed off Obi-Wan in Episode IV, and they couldn't kill off one of the new characters.Just a side note on these new characters, why do they all have one syllable names? Poe, Finn, Rey. Yes there's Kylo Ren, but his real name is Ben. Rey fights Kylo in the forest, however the fight is ended suddenly with no victor when they are separated by an earthquake.
It's basically a rehash of Episode V when Luke fights Darth Vader on cloud city and drops through a filter to escape, except here no one loses a hand.Chewbacca then detonates the bombs and destroyed the shield allowing the Resistance to attack the generator by flying inside and destroying vital components before escaping.
It's the second Death Star repeated almost exactly, except the Millennium Falcon wasn't the ship flying inside.Everyone then escapes the super weapon before it explodes and meets back at the Resistances base.
They like the last second escapes don't they? Anakin on the droid control ship in Episode I, Luke on the Death Star in Episode IV, and Luke and Lando in separate instances on the second Death Star in Episode VI.R2-D2 then 'awakens' and reveals a map from his memory that, with the map segment from the start of the film, shows Luke's exact route across the galaxy.
The film implies that the map R2-D2 had was from the original Death Star in Episode IV, 36 years earlier. If it's that old how does it have Luke's route already plotted on it?
A segment of R2-D2's map however is missing (which is the segment from earlier) how did this get lost, and how did the old man have it?Rey then uses the completed map to find Luke Skywalker to begin her full training as a Jedi.
Just as Luke went to find Yoda in Episode V, and the map from R2-D2 was essentially the same as ghost Obi-Wan telling Luke to go to Dagobah.This film should be renamed 'The Farce Awakens'
The actual title makes no sense anyway, The Force Awakens, was it asleep?After this mass-plagiarism I don't hold out much hope for Episode VIII, not even A New Hope, and definitely wouldn't waste my money on it at the cinema as I had done with this waste of time.",1,7,11,13 April 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Not bad but a terrible ending
","I never read the books but think this trilogy isn't bad, at times I'd even say they're good films, but they RUIN IT with that army of dead men!
Ghosts that cannot be touched by anyone (except Aragorn) yet are able to cut through living beings like they aren't there?Without the dead men Sauron would undoubtably have won, despite the death of the lead ring wraith, and I would have enjoyed seeing how that played out. I'm just glad after going to recruit the dead army it cut back to the decent scenes in the battle (implausible giant elephants aside) and we did not see the dead again until they rushed off the water.",8,3,5,27 April 2019
