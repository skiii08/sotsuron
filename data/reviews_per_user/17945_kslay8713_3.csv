Skyfall," A bit of a let down, but still entertaining
","Maybe it's just the greatness of Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace, but Skyfall is a tad of a let down, but yes, still entertaining. The films finer point is easily Bardem. He plays an incredibly villain, even being compared to Tom Hardy in Batman. His character is extremely dark and cerebral. He alone makes the movie worth checking out. Overall though, the bad guy just can't pull the movie all together in one tight package. This film is easily the worst of the Craig films in the Bond series. I am a huge fan of Bond and especially the Daniel Craig way of playing him. Don't think that because I'm saying it is the worst of the three, that it's not still a good movie. It's a decent movie and I will be adding it to my collection when it comes out on Blu Ray. Just make sure you go into the theater realizing what you are actually there to see. I do think this movie is worth 7 out of 10 stars and also feel that if you go in thinking the right thing, you will enjoy it!",7,1,4,19 January 2013
Django Unchained," Speechless yet again
","Once again, Tarantino does not fail to surprise. This is probably one of his top three films. Superb acting, very edgy tongue in cheek humor, and ultra violent. The casting in this film was also superb. I could make this a long review, but I will keep it short and simple because I just can't find many words to perfectly describe this movie............AMAZING. From Tarantino's great writing, to the characters emotion and humor, getting us to laugh at stuff that we would not normally laugh at, in public anyway, and the characters way to really grip you and suck you in, really feel what they are feeling. It's just incredible. I don't know what Tarantino plans on doing next, but to top Django, it's going to be extremely hard",10,1,4,15 January 2013
Zero Dark Thirty," One of cinema greatness 'POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT'
","I will try not to use any spoilers in this but it's going to be tough. I came into this film knowing the controversy surrounding it. I was expecting nonstop torture and everyone saying how great torture is. That's not the case, and I'm not sure how many have come to that conclusion about this film. There were very few scenes of actual torture, and it's almost just like you saw in Safe House, except a little more graphic. After that, you don't see anyone really justifying the torture. The movie isn't even about torture, it's about the chase for intel that led us to UBL. As a veteran of Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom, this obviously was close to home for me, as it was why all those have served were over there.That being said, the movie was very good, and I did see a ton of real world tactics being used, which you don't see every day in military genre films. The bad reviews on this film are astounding. Astounding in the fact that the people writing the reviews seemed to be going into this film thinking it's going to be an intense action film or somehow the film is being expected to go into the political aspect of the hunt or the political aspect of torture. I strongly recommend anyone go watch this film, but understand it isn't all about action or torture, or even killing. It's about the hunt that pursued to gather the intelligence that took us to the compounds doorsteps. I liked the acting, I liked the writing, and everything else about the film. I strongly agree with putting it as a front runner for best picture this year.",9,2,8,15 January 2013
