The Ring," A big amount of fear
","I am really suprised-I thought there won´t be a good horror movie soon-after all those vampires and werewolves.Too bad it´s really a copy of a japanese movie,but it´s a real good one!The only horror in last 5 years that I kept remembering scenes for weeks!",9,1,1,17 May 2003
Pulp Fiction," The best of the 90s
","Pulp Fiction is a real boom in action movies,unique style of Quentin Tarantino made this movie what it really is-a legend!Of course let´s not forget the great business that the actors did.Even now,after  9 years I like to watch it.It´s a first class movie for sure!",10,4,8,17 May 2003
