Requiem for a Dream," A film everyone should see once and only once.
","I was a big fan of 'Pi' and the director really lets himself go here. This movie is one of the best horror films ever made. Stylish, brutal and deeply disturbing with no special effects required. Jennifer Connelly is always easy on the eye but here she amply proves she can also act. The rest of the cast are also superb, portraying their various journeys. As an ex-drug user myself i could identify with some the characters and situations, reminding me of how things might have gone if i'd had a bit less self-control. Or no career to think about. I've also encountered mental illness in my family, so i related there also. If your up for the challenge this will definitely leave a lasting impression and absolutely guarantee you steer clear of hard drugs for the rest of your life. The best anti-drug film ever made, which also reminds us drugs come in many forms, both legal and illegal... This is no feel good movie, i will certainly never watch it again. But it gave me plenty to think about. 9/10",10,0,1,1 January 2006
Donnie Darko," Take A Trip
","From the dreamy opening scene its very clear this is no ordinary movie.I've always been a fan of writer/director movies because, afterall, who better to visualize and translate a text to the screen than the writer himself? This credo is borne out in full with this film.Sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.",10,0,0,15 December 2003
The Godfather," Good, but Great?
","I appreciate this movie as a very good piece of cinema but i really cant understand why its #1 in the Top250.Ok the performances are solid, the direction is fluid and the story tight, but it isn't one of those movies you leave the theatre feeling your life is changed or anything like that...Greatest movie of all time? I think not.",10,3,6,21 September 2001
