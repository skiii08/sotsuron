Lucky Number Slevin," outstanding dark comedy
","'Slevin out of ten rating' LOL WOW! I had never heard of this flick until it came on PPV and being a huge Morgan Freeman fan (my wife a Bruce Willis fan) we tuned in to watch. It was a superb offering, humorous, yet with a death toll that I'm sure rivals Scarface...and a twisting, turning storyline that is (IMO) very difficult to predict, but not to difficult to rationalize or follow as it unfolds. Pay close attention to the small flashback details as it allows a quicker clarity...BUT don't be upset if you miss some as they will all converge and focus at the climax of this very well written story...it's got one heck of a cast that lives up to or surpass usual expectations...I never cared much for Lucy Lui until watching this flick...What can you say about Morgan or Ben (That's SIR Ben...LOL) they are perfect for their respective roles. Josh plays his part to unbelievable excellence and Bruce, well he's Bruce, but justly so as Goodkat...gotta love him! Tucci is very convincing as a not so goody two shoes NYC cop and a very funny crew of henchmen with odd quirks that make them adorable in a macabre sense. This is the best movie I have seen in quite some time, especially considering the notoriety (or lack of)...I give it 2 thumbs up (your nose so your soda doesn't spray out your nostrils as the dark humor emits from the screen)",7,0,2,12 October 2006
