The Blair Witch Project," Scary, only if you let it...
","I have decided, after talking to several people about this film (I think of it more as a 'film' than a movie), that there are basically two opinions: either 'It scared the hell out of me' or 'I thought it was totally stupid.' I like to think that I enjoy engrossing myself in movies (er, films, I mean), so I happen to hold the former opinion.In trying to decide why this clear duality of opinions exists, I came to the conclusion that you have to let the movie scare you; you have to put yourself in the tent with these three, you have to imagine what it would be like to be totally lost in the woods with all sorts of creepy stuff happening around you. I think that those who didn't get scared by the movie either couldn't do that, for lack of imagination, or their subconscious wouldn't let them, as some sort of defense mechanism. I did notice that the older the person I talked to, the more likely they were to think it was stupid.And I'll be honest, for the first hour or so, I thought it was kind of dumb myself. I thought, rolling my eyes, that I was watching MTV's 'The Real World Goes Camping', but my eyes stopped rolling when the noises at night began. I didn't even admit that I was scared by the movie until I was at home that night in a dark house, jumping at every little noise. When my cat knocked something off a shelf, I nearly had a heart attack...That's when I admitted to myself that this movie (or film, whatever) really scared me, and I truly enjoy being scared for the sake of entertainment. I definitely give it my recommendation, and I think you will be scared too, but only if you allow yourself to be scared by it.",8,0,1,11 November 1999
The Aviator," Best Movie About Someone Unimportant
","If I wrote the tagline for this movie, it would read something like 'The Best Movie This Year about Someone Insignificant!' You may argue that Howard Hughes was some sort of pioneer in the histories of both the movie and aviation, but I would reply that if Howard Hughes was not around to accomplish those things, someone else equally unimportant would have. I give credit that this movie accurately portrays Hughes as both a risk-taker and downright weirdo, was beautifully filmed, and very well acted. But I can't get past the fact that Howard Hughes was likely only well known because he was very wealthy, and a person whose quirks only make him an irritating nut who treated other people poorly, and recklessly threw millions of dollars away chasing white rabbits (or rather Spruce Gooses). From the movie, I didn't see that he was all that noble, not enough for us to sympathize with him and regard him as some sort of hero. This was certainly a very well-made film, deserving of accolades for its technical aspects, but ultimately whose subject really doesn't matter.",6,0,0,5 July 2005
The Graduate," Overrated
","I finally saw this movie, after putting it off many times, and I am surprised at how disappointed I was. I certainly give the movie high marks for Dustin Hoffman's performance, and certainly Mike Nichols' direction was quite exceptional. But I expected more comedy, and I rarely laughed through the movie. I can appreciate that humor was being attempted in some of the scenes (i.e. the absurd situation where Ben is made to swim in full scuba gear for spectators in the backyard swimming pool), but the fact is, I just didn't laugh. I thought the plot was meager, the story not that interesting. The characters, as a whole, were just plain irritating. In a word, I thought the movie was boring. Sorry, maybe I just didn't get it.",6,0,5,5 July 2005
