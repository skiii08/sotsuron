Black Swan," A brilliant piece of 'Magical Realism'
","The movie is not actually about ballet - it is more about an inner dialog that Nina has with herself in preparing for the part of the Black Swan, given that she is a perfectionist.As the movie progresses, we see that she lives with her mother and her bedroom is completely pink with stuffed animals. This seems extremely odd, given that Nina seems to be a grown woman concerned about being an aging ballerina. The movie is more fun to analyze if we interpret it like a Kafka novel where perception is reality.In this sense, the real Nina may not even live with her mother of have an entirely pink bedroom - these are just reflections about how she sees herself. At one point we see her grabbing a few of her stuffed animals, running to the garbage shoot in her apartment building and thrusting them down the shoot exclaiming that she is not a child anymore. This is just a metaphor for Nina trying to escape her child like nature.Through out the film, Natalie Portman portrays Nina with a grimace - what seems to be a very concerned smile. This results in a vary flat performance for Portman, but it is exactly what the script requires - this grimaced perfectionist is exactly how Nina sees herself.Her competitor for the role of the Black Swan is Lily who seems to embody all the personality characteristics Nina does not have. Nina is very suspicious of Lily and one might say that Lily's character embodies all the sources of the neuroses that Nina has. Towards the end of the movie, Nina destroys Lily but ends up stabbing herself - a metaphor for the great sacrifice she has made to achieve the part of the Black Swan.In the final scene, she jumps and lands (as the White Swan's role requires) but the other dancers see that she has stabbed herself for her bodice is red with blood. The ballet director comes over and immediately he sees the blood and calls for help. This, indeed, is the final triumph of any artist, to give everything to that role ( or painting or book) and then be recognized for that effort.Given this 'Magical Realism' framework it is indeed fascinating to go through the movie and try to interpret the succession of events. In this way, the movie is truly amazing.",10,1,4,18 February 2011
Avatar," Unbelievable Cinematography!
","Viewers must remember that this is a James Cameron film and so one must not have raised expectations concerning plot complexity, character development or any hint of moral ambiguity. But from reading some of the reviews given here, one must consider that his films are very expensive and need to be successful in order to cover their costs - they must appeal to a very broad audience. It would be interesting to see what type of film Cameron could come up with if he did not constrain himself this way.I saw the film in IMAX 3D and the cinematography involved in presenting Pandora, the planet the blue aliens inhabit, is completely overwhelming. It leaves one with a vivid cinematic experience. The motion capture is amazing. Some may claim that the film is just a cartoon, but I have seen cartoons like 'The Prince of Egypt' and 'Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron' and the cinematography in both of those was amazing although the plots were slightly more nuanced than what would be found in a Cameron film. We must be grateful to Cameron for pushing the limits on CGI, for it makes the future of CGI that more exciting.In short, I enjoyed the movie tremendously, even though I am still bitter that Cameron would punt so effortlessly on dialog and plot.",8,0,5,8 February 2010
