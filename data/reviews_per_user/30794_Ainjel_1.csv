Alien 3," A Deep, Meaningful Tale of Personal Tragedy and Horror
","Alien 3 is a wonderfully unique and gothic addition to the Alien Saga. The ambience penetrates everything, and lasts till the end.  People who don't see this film for the message it delivers, probably will complain that this film is too gruesome, sombre, or whatever.  However, it has an underlying ethical meaning, and is rich in symbolism, which is for you to discover.The third installment of this thread reinstates the terror of the first movie, but delivers it in an altogether original manner.  This is no action flick, it is a movie with its own genre - a genre that was nearly lost in the action of the second film.  Once again, the alien has become a terrifying and sexual predator.  Ripley's character is fleshed out, even more, and we truly feel her Christ-like sacrifice.  True Aliens fans will love this, but those that came only because of the guns and claws in the first sequel, won't appreciate the true depth of this beautiful film.  It is my wish that, one day, they will release the director's cut of this film, so it can be seen in its entirety.",Null,0,3,16 February 2001
