The Avengers," Great casting decision
",Perfect casting! You can really see and feel that the actors have great chemistry both in and out of their characters.,10,0,0,7 November 2019
Spider-Man 2," Enjoyed it a lot!
",Had high hopes for this one because of the first film. Was not disappointed!,9,0,0,7 November 2019
Spider-Man 3," No other Spider-man film can top this one
",The third and final film to one of the few trilogies we have that are actually good. Tobey surely gave a whole new meaning to Spider-Man and set the bar high for the other Spider-Man movies that came out.,9,2,2,7 November 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Yikes
","Thor's character is great with the other Avengers, but he just doesn't do that well as a stand-alone character with his own storyline. It's sad because he had so much potential too.",7,0,2,7 November 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Surprisingly enjoyable
","I didn't expect I would enjoy this movie this much. The trailers looked too hyped for me and so I thought it would flop just like the other ones. Surprisingly, it didn't and I had my eyes glued to the screen because of the awesome animation the creators put out. Really good job!",9,0,0,7 November 2019
Spider-Man," Old school still the best
",Films from the 2000s really are way different from the ones we have now. I wish all origin stories could be as good as this one.,10,0,0,7 November 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Too much action. no substance
","Honestly, it felt like it was too much of a set-up for me. Having Antman isolated in the Quantum realm was just too convenient and it felt like Marvel was just looking for a foundation for the script they had for this movie that wasn't even as good as the previous ones.",8,0,0,7 November 2019
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Enjoyable. But just too much happening on this movie
",I expected more from Quicksilver. He would've been a great addition to the Avengers.,9,0,0,7 November 2019
Thor," Good job Chris
","Not a big fan of the action sequences but story-wise, this film did great. It really explains how Thor came to be and why he is the person he is now.",9,0,0,7 November 2019
Thor: The Dark World," Sequels still stuck
","Not as good as the first one. I had my hopes up the whole time as I was able to enjoy the first one, but I guess it really is true that sequels always do worse than the originals.",7,0,0,7 November 2019
