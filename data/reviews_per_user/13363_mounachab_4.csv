Resident Evil: Afterlife," Good Fun
","Okay, the franchise is what it is. You must already be a fan of the games or previous films to understand the characters and the thin plot. However this film is visually beautiful and not short on genuine action. I have been a fan of the games but not so much of the films. For me the first movie is only worth mentioning but since then this is easily the best. Okay there is not much character development and the family reunion of Chris and Claire Redfield is some what puzzling as there appears to be no case of 'Hi claire what have you been up to all these years'? Instead, this film is just action, action and more action and to be honest I did actually enjoy it. It was just 90 minutes of pure zombie and bad guy slaying. I imagine there was quite a bit of a budget spent on this film as there was some fantastic real scenery from airview of Canada, Northern America etc. And the special effects to help produce a scary and frightening post apocalyptic world are impressive. don't expect too much of this film, it is cheesy, thin on the ground in terms of a real plot and character development but is enjoyable for its pure adrenlin fuelled rush!! Good stuff 7/10",7,0,2,24 July 2011
Horrible Bosses," The film the hangover part 2 should of been!
","Funniest film of the year no doubt and was a big surprise to how good it actually was. The 3 friends who decide it would be in their best interest to kill their bosses are fantastic together and brings a similar comradery or 'wolfpack' to the hangover. The way they bounce of each other is fantastic and i lost count on how many occasions the cinema audience burst out with uncontrollable laughter, young, old, female or male. Okay, so what they decide to do sounds completely evil and sinister but you find yourself rooting for the guys in a tale of many twists and turns. Over here in the U.K Jason Bateman is the only one of the trio that many will recognise from recent roles in couples retreat or hancock or even far less recently in Teen Wolf two!! But the other guys Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis were brilliant and I can see only bigger things in store for both. Bateman is the straight man of the three and Day and Sudeikis just fight out to see who is deemed the comic relief of the three. Its very close too!!The first 15-20 minutes was not the best of starts to a film and it may be fair to say that the three bosses are the weak points to film. Spacey who is an amazing actor just didn't seem to suit the role for me and wasn't believable. Farrell took a page out of Tom Cruise's book from Tropic Thunder but was still fairly funny and there was Aninston who plays nympho boss Dr Julia Harris. Who let's face it!! Was hot in this film. Really hot!!! I think all three were okay, its just that the three of Day, Bateman and Sudeikis totally outshone them.The film did start to get much better when the three decided that killing their bosses may be a good idea. They begin plotting, carrying out research and following covert operations which lead to meeting other interesting characters along the way such as; A hilarious misunderstanding involving Ioan Gruffyd, An unusual character and name in Jamie Fox and a sat nav operator in Gregory.Some classic, laugh out moments and for me this is easily film of the year so far...I had the same feeling coming out from watching this movie as I did when I watched hangover 1... So much fun and I highly recommend.",8,2,4,30 July 2011
The Hangover Part II," not as good as the first
","My girlfriend and I went to watch this movie last weekend having waited 4-5 weeks since its UK release date. We loved the first one and I can honestly say the first movie is funniest film I have ever seen. Before watching numero uno, I had no idea what the film was about, except the title of the movie was a slight give away. Having no idea of the plot, characters and whom was starring in the movie think helped in the surprise element of how good 1 actually was.It was my attempt on number 2 to approach it in the same light however difficult it was from its constant trailers and marketing. However I made sure I didn't watch any trailers and when friends spoke about what they had seen before me I would put both hands over both ears and declare repetition of 'la, la, la, la la la' so no spoilers would reach me. Now having seen part 2 I was surprised the film was good (not as good) but still some fantastic laugh out moments if not as many as part 1. Ed Helms for me steals the show with his amazing energy on screen and on this occasion Mr Chow played by ken jeong makes more of a contribution to the plot which is fun if not just a tad over the top.Quick plot, Stu is getting married this time and is enforced to have a bachelor party of his own, however it is agreed that this would be of a much quieter affair. However, things don't actually go to plan. Its a fun packed joy ride of a film. i wont say anymore except, I need to be honest, you need to have seen the 1st movie to even consider watching this flick and it is purely designed for fans of the 1st. 6 or 7 out of 10?? Haven't made up my mind yet?",7,0,0,16 July 2011
Super 8," Super 8?? I'll give it a 6!!
","I heard so many things from the media and friends that had already watched the film that this movie was a cross between the 'goonies' and E.T.Well I can tell you now that this film is nothing like the Goonies. For me the kids didn't have that same chemistry from what we saw in the goonies (Even though at times you feel that the film tries to take aspects of the goonies) and I doubt a group of young actors who come together will ever have that again as Spielberg and Donner hit gold there. However there were still some good acting performances, notably from Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning. But when the group were a whole together it just didn't seem to click. At times it was just not funny even though there was intended humour directed through riley Griffiths (Charlie who in the end just became completely annoying through his constant blubbering, spitting and constant tantrums) and Ryan Lee (Cary who just wanted to blow stuff up, which became tiresome after nearly two hours of watching). However I must say that Joel Courtney did have a rather striking resemblance to a young Sean Astin (Mikey from the goonies) To say the film is like E.T. is rather unfair as on a whole this film is nothing like E.T. However without giving much away there are only three aspects that are similar to E.T. The bike chases, the ending and that the film is staged in the late 70's and early 80's. To have this film staged in this era does sometimes give it an E.T. feel to things but I quite like the idea of the film being set then as it gives the film a type of authenticity.Whilst watching this film you do feel a Spielberg presence and you can see very clearly some of his film influences such as those mentioned but for me at times and more notably 'close encounters of the 3rd kind' as when the story unfolds the audience find that there is a huge army presence who attempt to cover the truth from the locals. Sound familiar? Okay, forget about the films obvious influences and take it for what it is. This film is a children's adventure with a sci fi twist. At times it can be a little slow and cheesy, however it has great special effects and is on a whole enjoyable. However the ending did slightly ruin it for me and if there would of been an alternative one this film may of had a 7 or 8.I'll give it 6/10.",Null,0,2,20 August 2011
