Resident Evil: Afterlife," Resident Eye Candy
","If you enjoyed the 1st 3 installments , you wont be disappointed on this one,At least they're consistent with the quality and the genre of the film which is a Popcorn action movie ( because honestly we will be all disappointed if we see zombies doing Shakespeare right?)The original director is back, I don't expect much from Paul Anderson, although he is a good special effects and action director, his movies always jump from one scene to another (ex.Mortal Kombat)and plots are silly... but if you just keep an open mind when watching his movies, you'll actually get to enjoy it, at least his movies ain't boring.I just wished they showed more of Alice's clones before killing them off, they kinda downplayed it on this one after a grand introduction of them from the last movie. Anyway, it was nice to finally see Chris Redfield .The 4th installment in the Resident Evil movies is a cheesy but fun blockbuster, and I'm actually looking forward to the next because it will feature all of the characters in the previous films (and games)as is shown at the ending of this film....although I hope they make it the last one before they over welcome their stay.",6,1,4,26 September 2010
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Best movie based on a video game so far!!!
","I really enjoyed this movie, and I wasn't expecting it to be, I thought this would just be another disappointing video game based movie, boy was I wrong!!The story was fast paced and was moving quickly so there was never a dull moment, characters and performances were all engaging,there were some cheesy lines and clich√©s,but that's the only bad things I can say about the film... It was an epic adventure film which never seems to bore you from start to finish. One more thing I noticed is that even though this film lacked blood and gore (obviously it's Disney,lol) It still keeps you interested and you will not be bothered by it, because the entertainment value is pretty high. It's been a long time since I last enjoyed a live-action Disney film. Over-all, it's a highly recommended adventure film for the whole family to watch and enjoy together.",9,0,1,29 August 2010
The Expendables," Nostalgic return of the old school action genre
","Over the years , the essence of the action film genre evolved from the once tough bad ass hero terminate bad guys with explosions into the sensitive dumb arsed heroes wearing tights and capes and cg fest-giant robots we see today,( a good example is Scott pilgrim ).Now Stallone fresh from his recent great work in rocky balboa and Rambo, takes a break from making serious films and makes an entertaining action masterpiece which clearly was giving homage to old school action genre, this film was not trying to be inception or other mind blowing films we watched recently, it was just trying to be what it is, an entertaining and nostalgic ensemble action film full of explosions, one liners and blood. I don't know why people expect more than that, because they didn't cast De Niro, Pacino or DeCaprio so don't expect this film to be thick on plot. they cast action stars in this film who are known for their charisma and ass kicking... not for their actingI personally think every characters had their own moment to shine, the one person that really caught my attention was Dolph Lundgren , he really played a big bad ass in this film even though he wasn't in the final showdown , his character was the most memorable. It was nice seeing him again on the big screen, and I do hope they make a sequel with more old school action heroes...",9,1,6,28 August 2010
Megamind," Don't expect The Incredibles, Expect a Will Ferrel movie in CG
","As my title suggests ,if you go in expecting Pixar, you will be disappointed , but if you expect another Will Ferrel movie, you will have tons of fun, And it is interesting to watch a Will Ferrel movie in CG and without the adult toilet jokes, you don't see that everyday.This is a kind of movie which can be enjoyed both by adults and kids, it has a decent story , good animation and I liked the supporting cast, it's not great or epic as the Incredibles ,it's just simply funny... this a safe movie to see with kids,i am absolutely sure they will enjoy this one.It's a good movie if you're looking for something to watch with the kids.",6,2,7,7 November 2010
RED," Cool concept , Mediocre execution-felt like another ''Whole Nine Yards' sequel
","This a story about a team of aging retired CIA agents who is forced out of retirement because they were targeted for assassinations, It was a cool concept and sounds more like a spy thriller, but what we got was a comedy film with action, it works sometimes, some scenes are funny and some seem bland, actually this movie reminded me of another Willis movie ' The Whole Nine Yards' because of the dry humor.The performances were good and each character had their funny and bad-ass moments specially when Helen Mirren was shooting agents with a Huge Machine Gun, I recommend this film as a rental, nothing special, some scenes work some scenes just seem bland.",5,1,8,20 October 2010
