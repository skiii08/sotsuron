The Blair Witch Project," The worst Horror film ever with the best marketing team ever
","Title pretty much says it all. It was marketed as being 'real' and shills were HEAVILY involved with reviewing this film. Now this is the the worst Horror film and possibly one of the worst films ever made for 2 reasons. First, it's not a horror film. It's people walking in the woods who made a home video. Secondly, it spawned the worst trend ever in horror being the 'found footage' subgenre. Now I admit found footage did land a few good films: Cloverfield probably the best of all, Chronicle, and as above so below to name a few. So this film is only 'good' in the sense that actual competent filmmakers were able to raise the genre to its true potential. However, this genre became so commonplace because of the low cost of production and terrible filming being passed off as a 'film'. Thankfully this trend has pretty much died out and decent horror is being made again.",1,1,1,8 June 2020
Insidious," Run of the mill
","Generic, clichÃ©, predictable 'horror' for the masses. Maybe I've seen too much horror film but this one is decent at best.",5,0,0,8 June 2020
Paranormal Activity," Good marketing. Terrible film
","Absolutely terrible film. Not scary, terrible acting, and much like the Blair witch project a product of great marketing tactics. I'm only glad where this doesn't happen often where good marketing positively skews ratings of an absolutely terrible franchise. This isn't even horror is boredom filmed on a flip phone.",3,0,0,8 June 2020
Midsommar," Wtf did I just watch?
","I am woman, I am strong, I find family, I find acceptance, man is bad (even though he wasn't really that bad). I'm over it honestly.",5,0,2,20 October 2019
Godzilla," Humans just ruin it
","Just remove the humans. The main character is ALWAYS coincidentally where all of the action is taking place. It was so contrived that it takes you out of actually enjoying the film. Also, why are we focusing on the humans? WE DON'T CARE it's a Godzilla film not a random human with a boring generic storyline film. There's even review here comparing Godzilla to Jaws LOL. That should tell you Americans have NO IDEA what Godzilla should be. And the Godzilla collapse scene with the human is just absolutely terrible.",5,0,1,11 June 2020
Annihilation," Great visuals but little else
","I'll be honest I'm not a Portman fan. She seems to play the same character in every film. Frustrated, never cracks a smile, burdened, and all around bland. The visuals are great and the plot is interesting until it becomes immensely silly. I just laughed at the last 2/3 of this film it was utterly stupid even by Sci fi standards.",2,2,6,9 February 2019
Pocahontas," Typical white propaganda
",John Smith was never romantically involved with pocahontas. Pocahontas was 12 and didn't marry until she was about 20 after she was captured. Most of the Indians were killed due to disease and other things after the white settlers invaded their land. Yet in typical American Hollywood fashion they try to make The great white American the savior and market it to kids. Absolute garbage.,1,0,2,4 June 2020
