National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Stupid yet legendary like Paul Blart and Master of Disguise
","Nicolas Cage does it again. Fantastic acting, funny faces, funny voices, garbage ideas like stealing the president. That's what makes it goood. Best part is when Riley says coupe du grais cuz it's random and really pointless. And when Nick and his girl are going in to the elevator in the Queen's palace and he says GEEETTT INNNNN. Greg Heffley is an actor in this from wimpy kid. When Wilkinson dies and stays back to hold the wheel door barrier thing he has a realllly funny face like he is going number two. Just saying. Anyway there needs to be a third cuz its amazing and Cage can't be beat. The bees! The next one be about stealing the original screenplay cuz there's secret Indian treasure clues somewhere in it. Amazing idea right? Tell Cage about it. I better be paid for that idea as well. Finally this movie is great. Funny scenes and acting make it a ten. Peace out.
