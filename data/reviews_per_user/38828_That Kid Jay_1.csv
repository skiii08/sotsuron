The Ring," Not scary, but good.
","When I saw previews for this I automatically thought it was going to be bad. I then started hearing lots of hype about the movie and how it's our times Exorcist (which I don't agree with).  A friend of mine wanted to see it so I decided to go along, not expecting much from it.  I don't think I was scared at all while watching the movie, and I haven't been scared afterwards like some people are commenting.  It wasn't really a scary movie.  I did in fact like the movie, I thought it ended up being pretty good.  Nothing I'll watch over and over again, and I don't think it lives up to it's hype, but overall it wasn't too bad.",Null,0,0,22 October 2002
