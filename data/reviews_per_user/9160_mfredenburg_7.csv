The Equalizer," Denzel Washington has been in a lot of Good Movies - this is not one of them
","Denzel Washington has been in a lot of good movies. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. Having appreciated the mid 1980's series upon which this movie is loosely based; and liking Denzel Washington as an actor, I went to this movie feeling that the movie had a better than fair chance of being a good action thriller.The movie starts promisingly as we see Robert McCall's (Denzel's) efforts to positively impact those with whom he works and socializes. Unfortunately, the movie goes downhill from there. While Good guys killing bunches of villains and being unrealistically lucky is standard fare for mindless action films, the initial 20 minutes plus of this film tried so hard to convince us that this was not going to be such a film that the transition to being a mindless action flick is jarring and disappointing. Sadly, once Robert McCall begins his killing spree it truly does become a mindless action film that is largely without suspense or fun. The lack of fun comes from Washington's character who despite very token almost meaningless efforts to give the bad guys a chance to do the right thing, clearly enjoys figuring out all sorts of ways to kill them. Of course only bad guys use guns, but highly trained ex CIA operatives/assassins like Robert McCall eschew guns. So ex CIA operative Robert McCall does the competent professional thing by leaving guns on the ground throughout movie, instead choosing to kill the villains using a wide variety of methods that in real life would have put himself and the people he is supposed to be protecting at far greater risk. As described above, the situations Robert puts himself and the risky way in which he engages the bad guys completely contradicts the idea that he truly is this methodical experienced professional. That he manages to come out ahead could only have been accomplished by script writers with no regard for realism or the viewer's sense of credulity.The situations were so stupid that even I watched the film I found myself angry with the scriptwriters for being so obviously lazy.Frustratingly, Washington's character does not even do a good job protecting the innocent, putting them at risk even after being directly warned they will be put at risk by his actions.In the end this was a poorly made film not because it featured the hero doing ridiculously unrealistic things, but because the movie worked hard at the beginning to tell us this was not going to be mindless action flick, but than went on to deliver a mindless action flick that really was no fun at all.",3,15,30,21 October 2014
Star Trek," Star Trek meets Beverly Hills 90210
","This might be a fun science fiction film, but it really is not a Star Trek film. Sure at a superficial level it has all the Star Trek characters and makes some references that only someone familiar with Star Trek would get, but this film was not done in the spirit of Star Trek.While paying very thin lip service to the legacy of Star Trek, we are treated to beautiful hard bodies running around willy-nilly, firing their phasors and randomly citing Star Trek ism's.Though it is pretty much impossible to go into detail without writing a spoiler suffice it to say:The character development is contrived and uneven. No real attempt is made to maintain the integrity of the relative character ages of key Star Trek Characters, i.e. Chekov is more than just a few year younger than Kirk, etc.There is only a superficial relationship between the Star Trek Universe as fleshed out over the last 40 years to this new, hip, superficial, shoot from the hip universe.It boggles the mind the way key tragic events are dismissed and treated so lightly,e.g. the destruction of...... More concern was paid to the death of a Red Shirt on TOS than this particular tragic event.The Federation is portrayed as silly and incompetent by how they reward the immature and not ready for prime time Kirk at the end of the movie. Something no real serious organization would do.If this was a movie without the name Star Trek in the title, it would have been a fun,very superficial scifi action flick, but despite its name this was not really a Star Trek Movie.Is it a bad movie? Nah. Is it a bad Star Trek movie? Definitely!However, if you thought that the Star Ship Troopers movie was was an accurate adaptation of Heinlein's book Star Ship Troopers, then you will probably really like this film.Top 250 of all time - really??????????",2,19,35,6 October 2009
Man of Steel," Superman Redux good but not great
","'Man of Steel' is a good movie. Not as good as the first two Superman movies in 1978 and 1980 and (Superman and Superman 2) starring Christopher Reeve, but certainly better than any of the sequels for Superman post Superman 2. Superman with Christopher Reeve was much more tongue and cheek than the current iteration and I thought stayed truer to the Superman ethos. Further, despite the more tongue and cheek nature of the 1978 Superman I found the Lois Lane death scene much more impactful than anything in 'Man of Steel.' With that said 'Man of Steel' is a good film, with some great action scenes that complement a solid performance from Henry Cavill as Superman. Amy Adams is okay as Lois, but frankly just okay. Russell Crow as Jor-el brings does a good job, but in spite of more screen time does not surpass that of Marlon Brando as Jor-el in the 1978 Superman. In terms of the whole Daily Planet angle we will have to see how that works out in the sequel, but this first movie does very little to establish the Daily Planet as a the central player it has been in Superman lore.**SPOILER BELOW**The best thing about this Superman was that he actually did the right in killing General Zod. Yes, Superman's rule on not killing is a good one especially for someone as powerful as Superman. However,not killing General Zod would certainly have resulted in the deaths of further countless innocents as earth authorities would not have been able to contain GeneralZod. So actually in this case Superman made the very tough decision to protect innocent life by killing Zod. (note this is not in any way murdering Zod as he had already killed hundreds if not thousands and was poised to kill more innocents in a matter of seconds. Superman has not become just like Zod.) So when dealing with humans, Superman's rule is a good one, but when dealing with murderous, genocidal beings with powers far beyond those of mere earthlings such as Zod, the underlying spirit of the rule must be followed which is to protect innocent human life. Ultimately, Superman was morally obligated to kill Zod. Not doing so would have made him responsible for any further murders by Zod.To whom much is given, much is required and Superman will have to bear the burden of intentionally killing the last Kryptonian of which he is aware.",7,1,3,23 June 2013
The Patriot," Portrayal of British Brutality make this a film to avoid.
","The Patriot was very formulaic. Yet it had to the potential to be at least a good film. However, the fabricated unhistorical scene in which scores of colonists are purposely burned alive in their own Church by British Soldiers under Colonel Tavington was completely unnecessary to the plot line. We already disliked and hated the villain, Colonel Tavington, we did not have to see him burn women, children and men alive to make him a worthy villain.Even as the scene was unfolding for me the first time (and the last) I was very confident the British had done no such thing.Without the church burning scene I would have given 'The Patriot' a 7 despite its totally clich√© climax. With the church burning scene it drops to a 5 for being totally irresponsible in its portrayal of the Revolutionary War.",5,7,14,22 April 2007
Dunkirk," Dunkirk Underwhelms
","Just saw Dunkirk. I am going to go against the flow and say I found it to be mediocre. Did not like many of the directing choices Nolan made. Many of his choices felt contrived and made it hard for me to maintain my willing suspension of disbelief. Kenneth Branagh was in the film, but was heavily underutilized. We never got a feeling for the miracle that was Dunkirk. And we ended up with a surprisingly small film for such a big event. One example: over 800 small boats enabled over 300,000 British soldiers escape, yet we never ever saw that. Consequently, the film completely failed to capture the scale of this event.I suppose Nolan was trying to give a view of Dunkirk from the perspective of a few hapless British soldiers who had a very small / micro view of the war. This particular group, unlike the vast majority of British troops, appeared willing to do anything to get back across the channel with little regard for their fellow soldiers. Ultimately, I just did not find them very believable and I really did not care about them. Likewise, the French's only role was to try to get on the ships. One of main unsympathetic characters was a French soldier who stripped a dead British soldier to so he could pretend to be British in hope of getting across the Channel. The fact that is was the French that fought a fierce rearguard action that gave the British time to effect the rescue was ignored.Scenes that could have been powerful - weren't - because the proper foundation to make them powerful was never laid.In not using CGI to give the viewer the true scope of Dunkirk (using real boats, people, planes and ship would have been cost prohibitive), over 850 ships and over 400,000 troops, was not shown. One would have never guessed the RAF fought hard and deployed hundreds of fighters to combat the bombs raining down on the men waiting on the beaches, flying a total of 3,500 sorties and losing 145 aircraft while the Luftwaffe lost 156. In the movie ships rolled over after getting hit by single bomb and the fact that Naval ships can actually fight back was ignored. In fact an armed civilian ship, a paddle wheeler, actually shot down 3 German airplanes en route to successfully ferrying 7000 soldiers back to England in seven round trips. So in the real Dunkirk larger ships survived multiple attacks from German aircraft and actually shot them down. We get none of that from Nolan. Consequently, he created a distorted and inaccurate view of Dunkirk. I can appreciate artistic license, but Nolan went too far in creating his sparse and tiny Dunkirk.So while I generally like war films, this one underwhelmed me. It was not a bad film, but it was inaccurate and there are many far better war films.On the positive side I did see it in IMAX and some of the scenes were spectacular. The soundtrack was also powerful. If you want to see this film, see it in the theater and see it in IMAX. I do not think it is worth watching on the small screen.We deserve a real film about Dunkirk.",5,7,10,7 August 2017
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The Hobbit trys to be something it's not.
","The Hobbit is a really good book, the Lord of the Rings is a much better book. LOTR is truly an Epic adventure having to do with the fate of all of Middle Earth. The Hobbit is an adventure about dwarfs trying to reclaim their home, their treasure and also kill a dragon. A nice big fun adventure, but not really Epic and not really on anywhere near the scale of LOTR. Having read LOTR multiple times I felt that Peter Jackson truly captured the feeling and spirit of the book. Yes, there are some things I disagreed with in his movie adaption, but on the whole the movies were an amazing achievement.Relatively speaking, Peter Jackson's adaptation of the Hobbit falls way short of what he was able to accomplish with LOTR. Jackson's efforts to make the Hobbit more epic are severely undercut by giving the action sequences a video game quality. In the Hobbit you are bombarded with too many scenes and actions sequences that strain credulity. Sadly, the action sequences in the Hobbit film that take away from the experience were not even in the book. Further, the film's efforts to be 'Epic' by making the Hobbit longer results in extended action sequences and extra plot elements that really take away from the story. The result is a film adaptation that fails to capture the magic of the book that it is based on. In the end the film adaptation of the Hobbit falls victim to a movie studio trying to recreate the financial success of LOTR by trying to artificially pump the Hobbit up into three really long films and it just doesn't really work.Does this mean that the first of the three Hobbit films is is a bad film? No it is a pretty good film, but make no mistake that the Hobbit is not even in the same league as the Lord of the Rings.I give the Hobbit a 7 because it is a fun film with good special effects. If I were grading it strictly on being a good film adaptation of the Hobbit I would drop it to a 5.",7,2,4,19 March 2013
The Dark Knight," Dark Knight - a good film, but all-time top 10?
","I must confess I was somewhat skeptical going into Dark Knight regarding Heath Ledger's performance. I had heard a lot of the hype prior to seeing the film and I figured much of the hype surrounding his performance was related to and out of sympathy for his tragic death. My skepticism was unwarranted as his performance was fantastic.The film was fun and suspenseful. It is a good film, but for me there were too many contrived scenes for it to be truly a great film.Great films can come in all shapes and sizes, but the ones I find profound don't hit you over the head in an effort to be profound.Yes, Dark Knight addresses some good issues, but it does so in such an unsubtle manner that it disrupted my suspension of disbelief. For example, the passengers of the two ships deciding whether or not to blow up the other ship to ensure their survival. In watching this sub-drama unfold, the first thing that came to my mind was the unbelievable incompetence of the authorities in allowing the two major ships to be filled to the brim with explosives. The next thing that came to mind was that I was watching a variation on some kind of Lifeboat exercise. I give the writers and directors credit for trying to make this more than just an action thriller, but for me it just was not credible.I also found Harvey Dent's rapid fall/transformation into Two-Face somewhat somewhat lacking in credibility as well.I would recommend this film as a must watch as it is mostly very well done and Heath Ledger steals the show as the Joker, but no way is it is a top 10 film of all time.",8,1,2,30 January 2009
