The Blair Witch Project," Three student filmmakers disappear in the woods while shooting a documentary on the supernatural Blair Witch legend.
","This movie was freaky.  I know that that sounds a bit pedestrian but that's the only way that I can describe it.  The movie starts off appearing to be a couple of kids playing with a video camera.  As the movie progresses, it grows stranger and stranger.  Odd things begin happening to the three main characters but they write them off as just coincidences.  They soon find themselves in odd situations and unable to escape the woods.  That is all that I can say without giving away the entire plot.The element that makes the movie so weird is the way it was filmed. The filmmakers kept it in its original 16mm format complete with shaky angles. They sure didn't use a steady-cam.  This movie is a definite for this summer.  I gave it an 8.",8,1,1,24 July 1999
American Beauty," Definitely a must see--one of the best films in a long time.
","After reading the reviews for American Beauty, I thought 'It sounds good but can it really live up to the exemplary ratings that it received?'----Yes, it can.  I was skeptical at first--not sure if it would leave me awe-struck as it did for so many in its opening weeks.  American Beauty has a way of pulling you in--making you live the plot with characters--experiencing their smiles and tears.  It teaches you that beauty is all around you and it is up to you to see something for what it really is, through your eyes alone.  Its about finding happiness and love in a point in your life when everything seems to be in an exponentialy-growing, downward trajectory.  I was lucky enough to see American Beauty before its fame (my theory of its projected fame) hits the entire country.  If possible, try to see it before you hear anything more about it.  All of the actors/actresses are incredible--my favorites are Kevin Spacey and a tie between Thora Birch an Annette Benning for actress.  Don't get me wrong--I didn't think that there was a bad or even mediocre actor/actress in the entire film.  My only regret is that I don't have the means of writing an astounding review for this awesome film--I just don't have the words.  My semi-pedestrian comments are no match for the excellence that the movie achieves.  Everyone who sees it will take something different away with them when they leave.  So see this film as soon as possible and be ready to laugh, cry(in some cases I'm sure) and see it again.",10,0,0,21 September 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Tom Cruise takes a surreal journey after his wife, Nicole Kidman, reveals her passionate, adulterous thoughts.
","This final masterpiece of the late genius Stanley Kubrick is both audacious and captivating. Eyes Wide Shut proves to be a must for any Kubrick fan but is not recommended for the average viewer of escapist entertainment. My only complaint is that the MPAA made WB change 65 seconds of the film for the goal of receiving an R rating. Several digital characters were added to the print during an orgy scene. Their intended purpose was to cover up any random genitalia that might have been exposed. I wouldn't have any problems with this under normal circumstances, but Kubrick had no say in this. He died only four days after turning in the final negative to WB. They had no right to change his work. They should have kept it the way it was to preserve his memory.I am sorry for my little rant but I feel very strongly about this. The moronic MPAA have been on Kubrick's case from Lolita to Clockwork Orange. Despite all of this, the movie is definitely worth seeing. It is fairly long (159 min. (9 reels)) but it doesn't seem it (unlike Titanic). It produces some comical scenes and lines but will be remembered for its mysterious and surreal plot, dialogue and camera shots. A must see for this summer. I give it a 9.",9,0,0,16 July 1999
