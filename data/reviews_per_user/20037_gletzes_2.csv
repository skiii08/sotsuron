Mission: Impossible III," What a great movie.
","I am neither a fan of Cruise nor a fan of the MI series.I found the first MI movie to be O.K and the second awful but this new one blows both away.The movie begins with a bang(literally) and never lets go.The structure of this film has nothing to do with part 2.Here we have a team working together again not the super hero Cruise of part 2(now that i think again,part 2 shouldn't even be called 'mission impossible' it had nothing to do with the franchise other than the main character's name).There are many surprises in the plot,the action sequences are great(and i mean really great) and Cruise gets really dirty on this one while his teammates are really likable and Lorence Fishbern has a small but vital to the plot part.So far so good,but there's one thing that really blew me away in this film:the coolest,meanest villain i have ever watched in a movie:Yep,Philip Seymour Hoffman is that good!!I have always admired this actor but here in a popcorn/summer flick he really makes a difference and thank God his character is really well written.We don't have a crazy villain that overacts(ala Jack Nicholson -type of villain),we have a real cruel person that can also be very confident and very brave at the same time.The scene at the plane where Nathan is torturing Davian(Hoffman's character) would ,at a regular film,occur vice versa.It would be the bad guy that would this thing(i won't mention what it is) and the good guy that would show braveness,resistance.I won't say much more as to not ruin the plot but all i can say is this is the best action film i have seen in years and i hope that Hoffman will start playing in more big summer movies.",10,3,6,4 May 2006
The Shining," A joke....
","I am going to keep this short.This 'adaption' of the wonderful King book is a bad joke and nothing more.Of course there are many Kubrick and Nickolson fans in this site and,as a result,this movie has mysteriously find its way in the top-250.Jack Nicholson is laughable as Torrance and so is Shelley Duvall.The story,that has nothing to do with the book,is an incoherent mess and the characters of Jack and Wendy Torrance are complete jokes.My advice to anyone that hasn't read the book and wants to understand the characters of this story:stick to the TV series ....Oh ,and the people who are saying that Kubrick had every right to destroy the King story cause King is...not a good writer should stick to reviewing 'masterpieces' like 'eyes wide shut'.",1,13,30,7 August 2005
