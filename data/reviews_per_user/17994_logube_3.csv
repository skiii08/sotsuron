Angels & Demons," indiana langdon
","WARNING IT CONTAINS SPOILERS!WARNING: contains SPOILERS and inflammatory content against 1) the Vatican and the catholic church and the pope 2) Rome (the city of) 3) the movie itself 4) the carabinieriif you hold a grudge, as I do, amongst the other, against the 4 entities above, you might be mislead to believe that this movie is for you. yes it's true that you might enjoy, if you're inclined so, a mysterious killer (what is he? the devil? or A devil?) the death of some high ranking priests and a couple of carabinieri. and the threat to wipe out the whole of Rome (so that we can finally build a massive shopping center and underground park in lieu of).alas the good writers, producers and the good Ron Howard have delivered the usual happy ending blockbuster. and if you are a fan of the previous installment and of professor langdon as a detective of signs and historian, forget about it, because here the decision has been made to make good old tom, still full of stamina and in perfect physical form, into a sort of indiana jones 'de Roma'. yes, in fact, to set the tone, the good professor makes his first appearance in the movie not giving a talk on symbols, but swimming rather effectively on a university swimming pool.obviously nothing prepares the audience for the chopper scene (*), followed by the chute scene, followed by the supernova scene; at that point while Ron might think that he is going to surprise us further, he doesn't realize that it's enough to think of what would be the next most obvious and stupid thing to guess what's going to happen.if you're wise, take my advise: save the money and do something else..(*) not entirely true; in fact the Irish priest had mentioned earlier, en passant, that he had been in the air forces (which ones? the Italian ones? is he supposed to be Italian? with that accent?) as a pilot (never thought there could be a pope who had been in the air force).",1,8,17,25 May 2009
The Bourne Ultimatum," I thought it was a new movie!
","I thought this was a new movie, but I must have misunderstood. It looks like the previous 2! and the 3 'Bourne saga' movies all together all look like the 3 days of the condor! I think that if there is one thing that we know about USA thanks to Hollywood blockbusters is that at CIA work some very dangerous people! What? Oh no, they are sending an 'asset' to terminate me! IMDb requires at least 10 lines to allow me to publish my comment, but it's hard to find 10 lines of stuff to say about this movie. Maybe one could wonder about the planet hopping of Mr. Bourne, his infinite supply of passports, and of that thing, called money, that we all struggle (on a daily base) to procure. I know I know, a movie is a movie, it doesn't need to obey the rule of physics! I so wish I wasn't the obese 42 years old 'it consultant' I am, and instead I was a highly trained CIA cover-op assassin, someone that could survive everything and anything. I think it's 10 now. No really, I didn't like this movie so much. :-)",3,1,4,15 September 2007
No Country for Old Men," I didn't like it (again)
","'was this a Q. Tarantino movie?' I asked my girlfriend roughly halfway into the movie. I had seen enough blood and technical details about a rather new and clean way to kill people (also good to open doors actually), that I couldn't anymore place this as a Coen brother movie. in fact the Cohen brothers' last movies had been so bad that I was expecting something just plain bad, but this movie was a bad movie with a lot of blood, so i thought maybe it's Tarantino.no it is the Coen brothers, scratching the bottom of an exhausted creative barrel. Fargo gone Texas, but with a pinch of Tarantino. a crazy killer, an old sheriff, the usual gallery of immortal heroes or antiheroes.there is in American movies , this idea about people , or at least some of them, that basically you can shoot them, you can beat them, you can crash them, and they still stand. last man standing, bleeding, with bones sticking from their bodies, it doesn't matter: they still stand up, say something tough and off they go.they don't cry , they don't shout, no! they are real men! they stand up and go. like on Lost, the TV series, concussion after concussion, punch after punch, bullet after bullet.i wonder, don't they ever get tired of this life? and movie people, don't they ever get tired?clearly there is never enough violence, shootings and killing and bleeding; because this movie has plenty. Yes, it's beautifully shot, yes the landscapes borrowed from mother nature are beautiful, and grand, but these are the Coen brothers, they are pretty good at what they do, technically. what is missing is that sense of uniqueness , of unseen, of unprecedented, of originality that we tasted so many times in the earlier movies that made us love the brothers.Read my reviews on http://benmovies.blogspot.com",4,3,5,28 January 2008
