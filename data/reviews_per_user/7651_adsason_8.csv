Ford v Ferrari," Fun Big Box Office Racing Story
","A happy go lucky (aside from the ending) movie about Ken Miles and Carrol Shelby and their quest to make and race a car to beat Ferrari's dynasty at Le Mans.The movie was definitely enjoyable. Great true story, great acting by Damon and Bale and it was brightly shot. The way it was shot actually reminded me a lot of Green Book.I did have some issues with it. I thought the way the story was told was really straight forward and lacked any depth. I would have liked to see more of Ferrari's perspective, I thought Ken Miles family dialogue didn't feel very important to the story, I thought, outside of Tracy Letts, the supporting cast fell way short.So, while it was an easy watch despite its 2.5 hour run time, it lacked depth to bring it from a fun movie to a great movie.",6,4,6,22 February 2020
Knives Out," Fun, well paced, light mystery
",I really enjoyed the movie for what it was. The house was the perfect setting for that classic 'Clue' vibe. The movie never took itself too serious and they kept it light all the way through. It was paced really well and kept me engaged the entire time.I enjoyed how the story was somewhat solvable if you paid enough attention - I feel like not many mystery movies allow the viewer to actually figure out the mystery.All star cast made it extra enjoyable to watch.,7,2,4,15 February 2020
Yesterday," Yesterday I Wasted a Few Hours of My Day
","At first I was intrigued & of course excited to hear some good Beatles tunes, but after a while I was waaaaay over it & would have rather just popped on some Beatles records than watch this train wreck. The acting was subpar, the excitement of him being a star got old real quick & I never got engaged enough in the plot. The additions of Ed Sheeran made it even cheesier than I could have imagined.If you're looking to listen to Beatles songs, stick to spotify or watch Across the Universe.",3,2,5,28 March 2020
The Pianist," A True Story That Really Moves
","What an excellent movie. The heart of the movie is tense, anxiety ridden and full of sorrow. Does its best to capture the struggle, hurt and confusion of the Jews under Nazi Germany while following Wladysaw Spzilman (Adrien Brody) through his story.The entire movie was emotional, but what hit me the hardest was when the war was over and he was back playing for the radio station and there was this overwhelming sense of joy that was only there because of the horrible, terrible, disgusting tragedy.",9,0,0,15 February 2020
1917," A Classic War Movie Shot Unlike Anything
","I've never seen a movie shot like this. It was a masterclass in film.The story was yet another example of individuals going above and beyond the call in times of war to save their fellow soldiers. There's countless of these stories & the movie itself was very similar to Saving Private Ryan, but the stories never get old - it's astonishing the bravery and selflessness people can exhibit for their family, their fellow soldiers and their country.While I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, i still can't help but compare it to other greats like Saving Private Ryan and Dunkirk, which I happened to enjoy more. Still fantastic and would recommend.",8,1,3,28 March 2020
Midsommar," Tense, trippy and visually stunning
","First of all and most importantly, imo, the design, costumes and cinematography was stunning.The movie itself was very engaging too. You knew what would happen, to an extent, but it's still able to keep you on the edge of your seat. The story felt original to me and I constantly felt myself thinking 'who can think of this?' During parts of the movie; and that's a good thing.The movie was very shocking and also scary without resorting to pop outs. I detest pop outs so that was welcomed.The story had a bunch of plot holes and it stretched reality - they all would have noped right out of there after the elders committed suicide - and that detracted a bit from the overall quality for me.",7,2,3,24 February 2020
Parasite," Original, tense and wonderfully shot
","A well deserved best picture. A really unique storyline that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat. I am not sure I've ever seen a movie that I'd classify as a comediac-horror-thriller but in a way Parasite was.I loved the setting, love how it was shot and the dialogue was incredibleThe only reason I'm not ranking this higher is because I didn't like the dad killing the boss. I don't think the storyline ever built that up properly and it bothers me.",8,4,6,16 February 2020
Moonrise Kingdom," Classic Wes Anderson with a 80s-90s Nostalgia Feel
","Really fun movie in classic Wes Anderson style. Two misfits run away on an adventure with various trials and tribulations.The movie felt a bit like Stand by Me, but with Wes' dry humor, dead pan emotion and of course, his impeccable design, costumes and cinematographyDespite the feeling stated above, the movie felt new and original.",6,0,0,19 February 2020
