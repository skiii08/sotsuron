United 93," Like A Shot To The Gut
","The effect this movie would have on me became very clear when I was walking to my theater. There was a special makeshift corridor made for those of us seeing this movie. When I got in my theater there was nary a seat open, and I struggled to get a chair. I sat and watched the film start, and I slowly started feeling my arm develop goose pimples. With the shot of the terrorists, and then with the terrorists actually entering the plane. With every movement and phrase I my innards started to wrench themselves, as if they were a wash cloth that was getting wrung out. 'We have a possible hijacking' one of the characters said. 'I doubt that' his boss said. Then you saw it. One of the most shocking piece of footage ever shot. Then through some very minimal dialog, you saw the other plane hit the other tower. Then, one of the most memorable pieces of cinema that I have ever seen, one of the most memorable scenes of all time, the passengers aboard United 93 hear of the Twin Towers, and decide to fight back against their captors. Yes, we all know what happens in the end, and i don't need to spell it out. But, this film is like constantly being shot in the gut. With every 'I love you' it hurts a little more. This is the movie that they will be showing in schools to teach about this event in 30 years, and I could't be happier about that.",10,1,5,29 April 2006
Jarhead," Oscar is spelled J-A-R-H-E-A-D
","Hello IMDb addicts. This is Brady. And I am an amateur critic. I grade music as well as movies, and I just got back from a movie. It's called 'Jarhead', and it stars Jake Gyllenhall, Jamie Foxx, and Peter Sarsgard. And I thought it to be the first cinematic response to the current war. Just maybe not directly. The movie starts as Anthony Swofford (Gyllenhall, hopefully an Oscar nomination for him.) steps off the bus at his first day at boot camp. After getting the hell beat out of him by his drill Sergeant, he decides that the Marine life is not for him. So he tries to get out of it. He then meets his commanding officer Srgt. Siek (Foxx, in yet another Oscar caliber performance). Siek, is a bad ass, pure and simple. Swoford becomes a sniper. And befriends, and brands (watch the movie, it will make sense.) his sighter Troy (Sarsgard, yet another Oscar worthy performance). It follows them in the dessert from the first step off the plane until the end of the First Gulf War. No action, no politics. Swofford even says 'I never shot my rifle.' in the dessert when they find out the war was over. Simply put: Everyone regardless of your political stripe see 'Jarhead'. Sincerely, Brady",7,1,2,11 November 2005
