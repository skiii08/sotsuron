Changeling," Clint shows true colors
","This movie was disappointing. I felt it has potential to be edited to be a better movie. There were a few scenes that needed to be left on the cutting room floor, including those with anachronisms in dialogue that cheapen the worthwhile story, egregious and unnecessary capital punishment scene and poorly acted scenes involving the crazy murdering villain. By the time the capital punishment scene came up I was already fed up with this melodramatic saga. But the hanging was egregious and unnecessary and poorly acted to boot. I'm actually shocked that there are a number of reviews raving about this as being a great film. It's not and not in the same league as 'Million Dollar Baby.' Sorry, but Clint you didn't take enough time on this one or maybe you took too much time.",2,14,40,3 November 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Mummy Returns is even better
","Sorry all, but this movie is really bad.  There are some beautiful scenes, but a number that are ridiculous.  The acting was mediocre and I didn't care about the trek to throw the ring into the volcano.  It took way too long to get to that point.  Sorry, but Potter is a hundred times better as a film.",3,1,2,4 January 2002
Vanilla Sky," Good theme, good footage, weak film
","Vanilla Sky's theme of casual sex gone seriously wrong is the strongest asset of the film.  The film's cinematography is good (abandoned Times Square with all the neon alive is fine and the dizzying heights atop a skyscraper is petrifying). The acting is great as well. But still the movie drags.  The foreshadowing for L.E. is there, but I didn't care once it was made apparent.  No suspenseful build-up to have a payoff; and the main character's plight was not compelling enough for me to care.",2,0,0,17 December 2001
