Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Excellent film; lives up to fans hopes and fits the saga.
","Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace is an excellent film overall.  It fulfills it's purpose in providing good, clean entertainment and it fits well with the other movies in the six (or hopefully nine) part saga. Among the high points were the excellent actors such as Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman.  It goes without saying that the special effects are outstanding.  Among the most memorable scenes are the pod race and the climactic lightsabre battle.  Darth Maul and Sidious are fantastic villains that are instant classics.  Take heed: don't listen to those naysayers or critics, this movie is Star Wars!!!",10,0,0,26 May 1999
