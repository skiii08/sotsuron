Casablanca," The best
","Any man who has a true love should rent or buy a copy of Casablanca. The look on Ilsa Lund's face when Rick walks into the lounge and their eyes meet cannot be described. I wish that someday a woman will look at me that way. The best movie ever made! Conrad Veight was the highest paid actor to appear in the film. Dooley Wilson could not play the piano a lick. There have been many bars with various names connected to 'Casablanca' but they are all shams. 'Sixty Minutes' on CBS did a segment on the movie with Harry Reasoner reporting. It was done on the set of the movie in Hollywood. Harry told the behind the scenes story about Ronald Reagan being cast as Rick but it didn't work out. At the end of the piece Harry spoke of the first time he saw the movie. He mentioned the lady he saw it with and finished - 'if you are watching tonight,'here's looking at you kid'.",10,3,5,21 August 2006
