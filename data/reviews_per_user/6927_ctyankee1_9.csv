Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," This Sherlock Holmes movies is confusing and violent
","I have many Sherlock Holmes movies some with Basil Rathbone, Ronald Howard, Christopher Lee, Ben Snyder and more.
This is the worst Sherlock Holmes 'A Game of Shadows' 2011 I have ever seen with Robert Downey Jr as Sherlock Holmes. It has some humor in it but it does not equal the amount of violence right from the beginning. Many scenes of fist fighting, buildings and rooms being bombed and injured and dead bodies under the debris.
Robert Downey is dirty and injured 95% of the time when he is not in disguise so enemies do not recognize him
Some of the cast I liked was Jude Law plays Dr Watson,
Noomi Rapace as Madam Simza Heron who is looking for her brother
After watching this for 2 hours and 7 minutes the only thing I found out was is that Professor Moriarty is still Holmes evil enemy.I don't know what this movie was about. Every body seemed to be an enemy to each other and modern guns were being produced.Downey Jr plays in more Holmes movies. I did not see them but after this one I probably won't see them. He may be a good actor but the whole movie was lousy. To me it is the producers, directors and writers fault not the actors.",Null,2,6,20 November 2018
Coraline," Only for teens or older
","The story starts off very drab and scary, not good for animation story. A doll is being cut up by a robot like pair of hands with a scissor. The doll is cut up in pieces, the eyes removed, the stitches around the mouth are removed and the hair is pulled out inch by inch of yarn. Then the stuffing is taken out. A new doll is constructed. To me this is scary for a kid and sadistic for anyone to watch.The story is bleak and the scenery is like living in a cemetery, a haunted colorless cemetery. Coraline's parents pay no attention to her. They are irritable and working at home as if she is not there and does not count.At some point Coralline enters another world. It is more colorful, the animation is great. The performance of rats by a man that works for the circus is good. The animation of the characters to music is excellent.Half way through the movie Coralline goes to a stage show with Whitey one of the characters who mouth is sealed by her second mother. Another bad example for kids. On the stage is a fat woman with jewels on her bare breast, real big bare breast. I found this offensive and did not watch the rest of the video.I felt it was more for adults and tacky in nature.The artistic work is great but that is the only good think I can say about it.",Null,0,5,15 June 2014
Alexander," One of the lousiest movies I ever saw
","I was so looking forward to seeing this movie because of the great soundtrack album by Vangelis. I wanted to see the Roxan'e Veil and other songs and what part of the movie they were in.The movie was free to watch on the net. It starts off with a death and then Anthony Hopkins goes into the details of the life of Alexander. It is so boring and confusing you can't believe it. Hopkins is a good actor but he talked on and on there was no action for about 12 minutes. He went from places in the garden in a beautiful house/castle and walked next to a bird he scared when he pet it.Alexander is blond, young looks and talks more like a college kid that a fighter.He talks and talks and lectures his men how they can conquer the Macedonian kingdom. These men are all in uniform with soldier fighting outfits, fighting staffs, metal helmets and more. The man that played Alexander is like the class doofus. There is a man with long brown hair and a necklace with a round metal on it. He looks just like a woman until to see his chest. Hardly anyone believed they could do what Alexander said they would. Some scenes with Alexander and a male admirer reminded me of the way men look at women not men looking and talking to men.There was not much music the first hour. There was a scene that was really dumb. It is with Angelina Jolie who is the mother of Alexander. She is teaching him how to be nice to a snake. She puts the snake around her sons neck and it so happy the way he is responding to the snake. Please kill me now! I don't usually talk this way about films I like or don't like. I could not stand this film. I did not see it to the end it is over 3 hrs long. If it was better I would have watched.The soundtrack of Alexander is so great you think the movies was too. There is a lot of bloody killing in the movie long long long figths. The good thing I can say is the photography, the lining of soldiers in thousands ready for war in the desert and the sand be kicked up by horses with soldiers and soldiers marching to fight. The rest was bull.",Null,2,4,25 July 2016
The Adventures of Tintin," Very funny and action packed
","I thought the movie was good. There is a lot of action/mystery Tintin is like a young Sherlock Holmes, he is not afraid of danger, he can fight with the best of them. He sees clues no one else sees and follows up on them. The character are all animated and very funny one character the main villain Rackham some times looks human. There are some funny parts one I liked where Tintin in a prisoner on a ship and fights the criminals with corks of wine that hit the men like rocks.Steven Spielberg did a good job on this movie.(the bad character Rackham looked like him) The scenes of past with ships on the sea and battles were amazing The voice actor for Tintin played by Jamie Bell was clear and understandable. Snowy the dog was another helper to his master.There is a lot of drinking, from some characters, fighting etc. Better for someone 14 or over. The mouth movement and sound were really good with the animation.Keeps you on edge, I almost didn't make it.",Null,0,0,23 February 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," Amazing
","This film is amazing. It is about a man who wants to be a soldier. He loves his country USA and will do just about anything to get in the service including changing his name and State.I saw this film today Sept 11 2011. The is a great movie. It is patriotic and the men that play American soldiers are brave and willing to take chances for their county.It is a very uplifting movie even though it is a fantasy. The things that make this movie great were patriotism, heroism, love of family, standing for what right even though you may not have the physical strength to do it and people having faith in someone who wants to do the job and do it right.There was a lot of action, a lot of violence, no swearing or sex. It shows you that good acting and high values make a great movie.In some way the heroes of 9-11 and the victims are a part of our love for the things in this movie, love of country, family and most of all something we don't always understand, but worth living and dying for. In my personal belief it is God that allows things to happen for whatever reason and brings about love for others during a time of great sadness.",Null,2,7,11 September 2011
Shrek 2," Character more for adults.
",I rated this low because of the way the characters look and act.Princess Fiona and the Fairy godmother and Prince Charming mother all have exposed breast on their gowns I don't think this is appropriate for a animated movie aimed at kids.The movie is funny but the talk from the Fairy godmother about 'sexy' stuff is not my standards for a kids movie.There are a lot of actors and actresses in this movie for the character parts and Eddie Murphy the donkey is very funny as well as Michel Myers who is also very funny.. It is odd how the King is much older than the Queen who is younger and beautiful and they have a fat daughter that looks more like Shreck.I forgot how Shreck the first movie went and that Fioan changed any way I don't get it.,Null,1,4,22 June 2014
Life Is Beautiful," Funny but very sad
","When you first watch this you wonder what being Jewish has to do with anything. The film never says he is Jewish but supposedly he is. The star Guido is humorous and the things he does are very funny. Guido and his friend go to Italy. His uncle gets him a job as a waiter. Guido meets a teacher he falls in love with right away. He ends up marrying her and having a son named Joshua. There are many slapstick comedy type scenes that go 50 minutes into the film which do not prepare you for the serious part of the story to come.Guido is picked up by the Nazis with his son and put on a train. Guido also sees his wife with the women prisoners. Guido does not want to scare his son. He tells his son it is a game they planned for his birthday. They are all taken to a concentration camp.I thought the film was funny but I am critical of them portraying something funny that is not funny. This was done to fool young Joshua and not scare him because this all happened on his birthday. Joshua is a smart kid. I do not believe this 'game' would stop him from noticing how evil the soldiers were and how bad they treated the people. I felt the plot was too unbelievable to believe.The more I see the way people were treated during the war especially the Jews it breaks my heart. Our life is good and we don't see the results of the past wars. There should be more documentaries on the present wars, our soldiers, their injuries and the trials they have to go through.

Some Like It Hot," Really stupid movie
","Marilyn Monroe wearing dresses that expose a lot of her breast and a dress that goes so far down she might as well wear nothing. This is awful for a movie made in 1959.Tony Curtis dressing up as a female, changing and his voice is not funny.The reason for the men dressing up as women is stupid and I don't think the reason the writers use is legitimate for dressing up men like women to escape gangsters.This is a movie transsexuals will enjoy. A lot of series with homosexuals are being put back on TV like: Frasier with 2 gays in real life but are his father and his brother on TV, Modern Family-gay fathers, Will and Grace-more homos, Murder she wrote has many homosexual actors, Ellen series she is a homosexual.Who is TV, Comcast and other trying to promote.TV makes me sick I am starting to hate TV",Null,3,33,21 October 2017
The Cannonball Run," Mindless crashing
","I did not watch all the movie. It had a lot of actors in it but I did not think it was funny.All you see in the beginning is people crashing the cars and motorcycles they want to race. What a mess.They seemed to use religion in it to make fun of different religions. Sammy Davis Jr I believe turn to the Jewish faith during his life and in the picture he holds up the Star of David but is was not in a respectful scene which it was used as a gimmick in the place where they were.Later him and Dean Martin who looked like an old drunk were dressed as Priest.They were betting on a horse and they acted really stupid. The story goes on and then it make fun of another religion I think Islam, I am not sure.When Dean Martin started swearing and dressed as a Priest he used 'God D m' I stopped watching the movie. I alway thought he was a drunk but I found this so offensive I could not watch the rest.Lots of stars but no talent. Don't waste your time.",Null,1,5,26 February 2012
