Skyfall," Worst Bond movie ever...
","Are you nuts?? Superb? Wow? What is this? 7.8 in IMDb? Who writes these reviews? Bond movie without gadgets? Bond movie without feeling? Bond movie without proper script? Bond movie with worst gay villain ever? Bond movie with worst act ever? Bond movie with about 20 minutes of action and the rest is just boring stuff. Come on? Two Hours and 20 minutes for this foolishness? What they were thinking? I am a hardcore Bond Movies fan and I always have enjoyed his movies.I thought Son Connery and Roger Moore, were the best actors. Don't get me wrong, I liked very much Casino Royale and Daniel's Graig performance. Quantum of Solace was mediocre, but Skyfall is by far the worst high-budget movie ever. Not only for a Bond movie, Anyway, if you are a Bond fan I suggest you skip this movie, period! (The only thing that counts is the opening title scene and Adele's song)",1,9,15,10 November 2013
