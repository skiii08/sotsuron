Blade Runner 2049," Huge disappointment
","Blade Runner 2049 is just a poorly done movie.
Spoilers:
The movie is so CGI heavy that there is not much plot at all.
Filming is almost all dark and wet, which is WAY WAY WAY overdone.
Dialogue is wooden and at times sounded like a first read through.
At least this one did not have excessive tobacco smoking like the orginal, and consider, in a world where resources are very limited would the society be growing food or tobacco?
As to 2049. where is the story?
Decker is missing, some new replicant blade runner gets a mission to find 'the child' and Tyrell Corp has been replaced by Wallace.
The Wallace character is not developed at all. His lackies are charactures, and the action (what little there is) is so predictable and has been seen a hundred times over.
I like thoughtful, intellectual sci-fi, but this is neither intellectual nor is it action. It is just yuck.
Music score is overwhelming as if is trying to force the movie to be good, but it cannot.
2049 is ever further away from the book, 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' than the first movie, and 2049 suffers greatly for that.
I suggest you watch Soldier with Kurt Russel as it is supposedly set in the same universe. That movie is far better than Blade Runner 2049.",2,10,17,26 April 2019
