United 93," I shook the whole time
","I was genuinely surprised when I saw this film last night. I expected a Hollywood version of the tragic reality. Instead, I saw a devastatingly real portrayal of the tragic events as they unfolded.After the first half hour- 45 min. of the film I was by no means convinced of it's quality. I disliked how fast-moving it was. The dialogue was hard to hear and follow. I though some of the 'Actors' seemed very fake and stupid. Then I realized that we were ALL 'stupid' the morning of Sept. 11th. Until the action began to get a grip on what had actually happened, which DID NOT OCCUR until the late afternoon/evening of Sept. 11th, all of us, including the air traffic controllers and military, were more shocked and confused than angry and revengeful. Then the film really got started. Once the endless back and forth confusion of the air traffic controllers and military ended, the film focused solely on the passengers and terrorists aboard flight 93. I don't know if I can recommend this film to others for one reason- It scared me.When the plane started going down, I couldn't help but gasping for breath through my tears because I felt like I was aboard. You can FEEL the fear and desperation they felt, and it was scary. This film was not sugar-coated by any stretch of the imagination. It was raw. I think it was well-done because it was not made up. The director presented the fact as he knew them and didn't attempt to stylize or change anything. He didn't over-generalize it either. Its a human story. And its worth seeing simply to appreciate each and every day you have on earth with your loved ones.",8,3,6,30 April 2006
