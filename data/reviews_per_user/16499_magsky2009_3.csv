Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I Think most People missed the point of the prequels.
","I really think most of the so called 'fans' of Star Wars, missed the point of the entire Prequel Trilogy. First and foremost Episode One, was meant to be a set up film. Not only for the next two movies, but for the whole saga. George Lucas wanted to tell the back story. The rise of the Empire and the Sith, and the fall of the Old Republic. The main point was to know 'Who was Darth Vader'. First off to know Who Vader was we have to start at the beginning. When he was a boy, as set up in this Movie, we get a basic sense who the boy who would grow up to become Vader, really is. Now First Aestheticlly, the movie is phenomenal. The settings and visuals really are Gorgeous. The Special Effects, for a 1999 film, still hold up Today in 2010. They were Groundbreaking and Nothing like this was ever done before. I mean let's be real. Without Lucasfilm's ILM there would be No real Special Effects. Next, The story- Obviouslly the First installment was based towards a younger generation. Jar- Jar, at first I couldn't stand him. I thought he was horrible. Now I look back at the movies again and, yes there are some things that were too slapstick. However Overall he really wasen't That bad a character. He was clumsy and awkward. However in a strange way, He more or less worked. Now the story which was set 10 years before Episode II, the main plot didn't focus on the story as a whole. Yes people will always complain, but every installment of the Star Wars movies, had it's importance. In episode I,it was to show Anakin's Start, how he was a nice kid. His start as a padawan. Now some people say this Midiclorian stuff was wrong. I kind of agree, something that made the force special, was not knowing really what it was or the true mysteries behind it. Kind of like the impossibility of Understanding what God really is. Did the midi's ruin anything for me? No, it was really a small part of the movie. Kind of like in A New Hope, When people were wearing shirts 'Han shot first' O.K. let's be real, does it really matter in the story as a whole, NO! Get a life people, Kiss a Girl. Anyway back to Episode I, the main point was the force is strong in the Skywalker blood line. So to assume that Anakin Destroyed the Droid control ship was random. As Qui-Gon says 'Nothing that happens is accidental' The force is behind it all. Next, In order to tell a movie that would please everyone, well that is impossible. Was this the best Movie? NO, it was still a very good beginning to the Star Wars saga. As they say all sagas have a beginning.",8,10,17,23 May 2010
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," I Can't believe Some people saw the same Movie I saw.
","Some Fans give it 8, 9, even 10 of 10. O.K. I gave it a 9. Now some others are giving it one. ONE, really is that because they didn't like the Movie? Or is it because Lucas bashing has become the 'Nerd' Thing to do? Let's be realistic, Star Wars is a grand space opera. Yes I am a total fan, Probably. A 'Nerd', Of course. At least I can think for myself and not follow the idiocy of the 'group'. At least I am Married, yes to a woman. How about You? Now to the Movie. Episode II was Not the best Star Wars Movie. However let us break it down. The Primary reason behind EP.II. Was to show the growing Love between Anakin and Padme. Yes I admit George is a great Sci-Fi Writer/Director. His ability to write and Direct love scenes is not the greatest. But who really sees a SW Movie for the Love Story. Did the Clumsy Dialoge and Predictable Romance Ruin the Movie. NO! The story progressed as promised. Let's look at the fun behind this Movie. First the speeder chase through the skies of Couroscant. That was adventure at it's finest. The battle between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett. Awesome and even better than that. OF course, when Obi-Wan, Anakin, and Padme face the Beasts. That was a little to reminiscent of the '50's TV Serials. However it was something new for the SW saga. Then when the Jedi arena battle begins. Welcome to Star Wars!!!! Jedi fighting in battle, I have waited My whole life for this scene and they got it just right. Then the Clone Wars Officially Begin, the Clones attack and the battle is on. These two scenes are two of the best visuals I have ever seen. It made me want to go home, Take out my vintage Star Wars figures and play with them all over again. Now to the detractors. Really is the movie as bad as you say, or are you really a Brokeback Mountain fan. Come clean now. This movie is Star Wars. Yes there is too much forced Dialoge, Yes there is too much, that could have been changed. However Overall this is a real Star Wars Movie all the way. 9 of 10 Stars.",9,1,2,23 May 2010
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," They saved the best for last. It really was a great end to the saga.
","Now I have to be serious. People, Listen. TO the fans that enjoyed this movie, you have great taste. In my opinion this is the perfect end to the greatest saga - Sci-Fi or not. To the 'Special' people who gave it one, or two stars, where you really watching the same movie as the rest of us, or did your Brokeback Mountain DVD break from to much 'Enjoyment'? Huh, let's be honest, this movie was Fantastic. To start, the story between the lines has to be understood to truly appreciate this movie. Sideous' manipulation of Anakin. Anakin breaking the Jedi code and impregnating Padme. And finally his fall to the Dark side. This was a movie of all movies. The beginning was a total all out battle that was unreal. After all that goes on, with the war, General Grievous, and Count Dooku. Yes it is all there. However the main part of the story was the total downfall of Anakin and his becoming Darth Vader. Also of importance was the fall of the Jedi and the rise of the Empire. After losing his Mother in Ep II, Anakin would do ANYTHING to save Padme. Yes Sideous was manipulating him, However after Years in battle, Anakin was really in need of Padme and their Love. This movie has everything a Star Wars fan, Excuse me everything a REAL Star Wars fan could ask for. After Anakin was informed that Palpitine was the Dark Lord of the Sith, that was the moment in the saga. Anakin comes in as Sideous was 'being Arrested' Sideous apparently set it up so he could be 'weak' at Anakin's time of confusion. Anakin reacted. When he cut off Mace Windu's arm that was all Sideous needed. He disposed of Windu, and made Anakin pledge his allegiance to The way of the Sith. He was lost to the Dark Side.(Until the eventual redemption in Ep VI.) The ultimate battle (After the fall of the Jedi) Anakin vs. Obi-Wan, the best Lightsaber battle in the whole saga. This was mixed Nicely with the battle of Yoda Vs. Darth Sideous. In the end Most people knew how the movie would end. The ride to the end was Spectacular. THe end was all I expected and More. All in all the greatest Star Wars movie ever. This was the greatest Saga in History.",10,4,7,23 May 2010
