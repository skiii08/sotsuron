Lone Survivor," Powerful and crude, This movie deserves 10/10.
","This movie shows its audience the brutally crude and horrible reality of war. It is an emotional powerhouse that will make you appreciate you are living in a peaceful country, and are able to enjoy a motion picture.All the actors do a great job. Mark Wahlberg is at his best, and the supporting cast are able to captivate the audience. The fact that this is based on real life events makes this even more impressive. I hope their roles were true to the actual soldiers they were playing.I am glad this movie was made the way it was. IT deserves all the awards it can get. It is the best movie of the year and easily one of the most powerful movies I have seen in my life.10/10",10,3,11,22 January 2014
Oblivion," Awesome movie
","This movie is an all around cult classic.It takes some of its best ideas from previous sci-fi iterations such as moon, 2001 a space Odyssey , total recall , Prometheus, heck I think it's got some mass effect(video game) going on as well.Although the story elements are composed of old ideas, the way they are put together around the main character make for an excellent departure from the typical sci-fi scene.**Beware of the mid-movie plot twist!!**The visuals & audio are fantastic, and the music is very adequate. The lead actor is superb as always. The overall cast, although very limited (almost no humans)get the job done.Sadly, due to the fact that some ideas are recycled ,or previously seen, the movie will leave an overall feeling that it is lacking originality. (for the sci-fi movie lover)Still one of the best looking/sounding movies this year. A must see",9,2,4,19 April 2013
