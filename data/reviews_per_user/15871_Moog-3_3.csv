Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Where's the Joy Stick?
","Congrats to Mr. Lucas for making the first two hour video game with a plot. I spent most of the movie looking in front of my movie seat for a joy stick. This movie lacked any of the personality or charisma that the first three had, especially when it comes to the character development.   If you have a twelve year old...take him or her, they will love it. (If I had a blaster, I would have shot ja-ja binks after the first ten minutes). Unfortunately, that's the age and mentality who will be entertained by the movie.  Most adults will leave wondering why they just paid 8 bucks to watch 'Barney in Space'. Lets hope for better from episodes 2 and 3. Oh, by the way, it turns out C3PO was built by Darth Vader...'C3P0...I am your father...come to the dark side'  Hey....why not!",Null,0,0,25 May 1999
Saving Private Ryan," If you ain't American....
","Regardless of the 'quality' of the movie a few points about some comments made by previous reviewers:1.  I don't know why you consider this a 'typical' american movie.  Gee, could it be because it was only about Americans??? That was the point...it wasn't supposed to satisfy people from Holland or England or anywhere else...it was meant to show what AMERICANS went through on D-DAY (were there any other countries at Omaha beach..no) and if you ask any American vet who was there, he will say the only thing that was missing for them when they saw it was the real bullets.  By the way, my grandfather was there.  So to this extent and for these reasons, yeh it was very 'nationalistic', as well it should have been.2. How could the americans beat the germans in the last battle...well, first of all, they didn't...only the mustangs saved them (and D-Day to the end of the war in general) Secondly, it is possible that it COULD happen with well placed positions and a plan if you know military tactics and anyway...ITS JUST A MOVIE!!!3.  Thirdly,  they weren't Marines portrayed...they were army rangers...learn your history...the marines were in the south pacific.All in all, this was a brilliant movie...I suppose you have to be American to 'get it'.",Null,1,2,16 February 1999
The Thin Red Line," Worth a second look
","I dont feel as though I can add to what the other 1,000+ people have said about TTRL as a film.  I can say that after I saw this film for the second time, now 5 years after the first, I came away with a much deeper appreciation of it.  The first time I never got past the surface story line. During the second viewing I believe I believe was much more of an emotional experience where the subtle nuances of the film jumped right out at me. DEFINITELY, worth another look.",Null,0,1,17 June 2003
