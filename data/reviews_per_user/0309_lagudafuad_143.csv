The Mask," somebody stop me
","You just have to appreciate the technicality and the visual effects that went into the production of this massive hit. The Mask introduced a character that we all started to love and cherish, a hero that can do absolutely anything his mind thinks of. This slap stick comedy showed how Jim Carrey became a good lead actor; he carried the show right from the start to the final battle, doing everything we see in the Warner bros cartoons.After this massive hit, an animated series was also done, introducing more villains and more takes into the life of Stanley Ipkiss. This movie 'The Mask' is based on a series of comic books of the same name; the comic is the product of Dark Horse Comics and The Mask was introduced in the 80's based on a concept by the publisher Mike Richardson and created by writer John Arcudi and artist Doug Mahnke. Like in this movie the comic series follows a magical mask and its owner Stanley Ipkiss. When the mask is worn the wearer can bend reality, do the impossible physically and survive the unbelievable. All this is based on the wearer's depth of imagination which The Mask will then surpass.The plot is about a Mr. nice guy, Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) whom the world seems to step on. Things took a turn around for Ipkiss when he came across a magical mask, which gave him powers to do the impossible. But The Mask was uncontrollable and Ipkiss stepped on toes which were ready to do anything to kill the man behind the mask. The movie is filled with thrilling visual effects, and a wonderful cast. Jim Carrey was just exceptional. The Mask was also Cameron Diaz's first acting role, which later pushed her up the ladder as she now features in major movies yearly.The Mask was a huge box office hit making over 350 million from its 23 million production cost, it was also a critical acclaim, leaving behind it a trail of catchphrases in its time like 'smoking' or 'somebody stop me'. Its high box office status made the makers approach Jim Carrey for a sequel, which he turned down (as Carrey believes making sequels are not challenging). The ideas for the sequel were then used in the animated series, which spawned two seasons. Later after 11 years, a sequel was made but it was unrelated to the first or the animated series, it was titled Son of The Mask which received high negative reviews and was a box office bomb, as the visual effects and the plot were lame and out of place, putting in consideration that it was made with over 84 million.Our hero The Mask is best portrayed here in this beautiful movie and it is a keeper. www.lagsreviews.com",7,1,1,24 December 2012
The Avengers," Best of the best
","Earth's Mightiest Heroes come together under one roof, led in battle by the perfect soldier himself Captain America, to face the Asgardian Villain Loki or as Hulk put it 'Pewny god'.First thing, what happens when u put Bruce Banner and Thor in a vessel way up in the sky and then Banner sets Hulk loose?Chaos like no other.I have to say watching this film will put you at the edge of your sit for the total 2hours 15mins. Sadly to say Nick Fury's (Samuel L Jackson) acting was the weakest among the group and Mark Ruffalo's was the best.But the hero to watch out for is the Hulk, this massive walking gamma radiation will make you laugh, trip, and then roll on the fall clutching your ribs.You don't believe me? Go get a dose of The Avengers.This movie is CGI invasion, almost everything at the final frontier (final battle) was CGI incorporated. So well crafted was the CGI and so well mastered were the actors themselves that they flowed with the scenes with ease.The comic relief in the movie were both The Hulk/Banner and Thor, these were the high notes:1. When they took down an invading alien ship 2. When Hulk and Loki met face to face. 3. When Banner and Thor discussed Loki.I felt the comic relief was well crafted into the movie; kudos to the script, the screenplay and cinematography were also on point.The screenplay was done by Joss Whedon who worked on Buffy The Vampire Slayer, he made every scene especially the fight and battle scenes so interesting a sight. The comedy/action scenes were precise and will leave you gasping for breath, as you never expect them. Even now that I told you where they are still... you won't see it coming, trust me.Directing in its part had to be done by a master director, because having all this heroes together, you have to be able to mix and match, so that none is underutilized and none is hugging the screen time, nice work Joss.And watch out for cool camera angles, one had Captain America assessing a scene and we get to see it from a reflection.Again a wonderful performance by Tom Hiddleston (Loki), when he played Loki in the 2011 Thor, he did it so well I actually thought he knew the guy. Here too he did the same, I hope this won't be the last we hear of him.Wasn't so exciting, was the Iron Man character (although that is my point others may view it differently), his humour always went over my head all through the movie. Black Widow and Hawk Eye, they held their own as they had no powers or a special suit, they made sure they had their share count of dead robotic bad guys. Captain played an important role in the end, but the thing that was worth the watch in his character is the way he was oblivious about things. Thor was graceful as usual, but the Hulk was the icing on the cake.All in all, go see it.",8,3,8,28 April 2012
Vertigo," Not as great as they say but fun to watch
","Vertigo is a mystery film in the late 50s that has a way of luring you in till you become hooked to see how it is all going to turn out.I love the nice twist in the ending that makes you know that all that you are watching is just a setup that is if you have not read the book prior to watching this classic.Although many a classics have been made, Vertigo has received many praises which I believe it does not deserve. Viewers may be bored by the lengthy drama, but if you are the kind that loves to see how it is going to turn out, then Vertigo is a movie for you.The film stars James Stewart as former police detective John 'Scottie' Ferguson, who had to retire due to disabilities (vertigo and clinical depression) incurred when a police colleague died trying to save him.Scottie gets a call from an old friend who hires him as a private investigator to follow his wife, Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak) who is behaving strangely.Scottie begins the job which led to him falling in love and becoming obsessed with his work.The screenplay is an adaptation of the French novel The Living and the Dead (D'entre les morts) by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac.Although Vertigo is fun to watch, it may be a bore at times and has so many loose ends. Some of the times the camera angles were weird, the use of the zoom to play out the vertigo feeling is to be praised though.Well if you are ready to sit 2 hours for a movie to thrill ya, then vertigo is it. If not try something else.",6,2,7,7 September 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," aargh!!! Jack is back
","Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, is an adventure fantasy film and the fourth installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean series. In the film, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is joined by Angelica (Penélope Cruz). I am not a huge fan of part 4s and was skeptical about the movie and expected it to stink.This movie packs a lot of action and reminds us why we liked the 1st Pirates of the Caribbean: curse of the black pearl. This to me is the second best of the series as the writers take us back to the old Jack Sparrowoh! Sorry, he prefers to be called by his full name Captain Jack Sparrow.Also in this movie we have Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) return with a lot of arggh, and a lost leg. You won't even miss Will and Elizabeth Turner as Angelica (Penelope Cruz) does a good job as a female role to replace the two.The plot to me was pointless and lacks all sense at all, and yet the director still found a way to keep me glued. The movie did have lumps, as Jack Sparrow's swag was a little tuned down and we get to see him look serious at some time, the length of the movie to me was also unreasonable, some dialogue were let me say foolish and while some achieved the purpose of making you laugh.The plot is centered and continues from the previous movie, as we watch a three way chase The Fountain of Youth, by The Spanish, The English led by Babossa and Blackbeard (Ian McShane). The movie has a subplot that involves a mermaid (French actress Astrid Bergès-Frisbey) to a missionary (Sam Claflin). Ian McShane, did well in the role of Blackbeard as he had the voice that can make any character look like the devil.The romance between Jack and Angelica, was just cool as we see them fall in and out of the love thingy.If you are a big fan of the first pirates film you will love this one, if not please stay away. All in all, Johnny Depp put in a fantastic performance and although i believe the writers could have done a better Job with the plot, i still give the movie a seven as it is a funny, good, not for young kids as the rating 13 says movie. all sense at all, and that's how we love it. The Spanish have found a way to get to the fountain of youth and the English we see King George II (Richard Griffiths), captures Jack and his first mate Dibbs with the help of Babossa and ask him to lead them to the fountain of youth before the Spanish get there. Jack escapes and gets captured by Blackbeard and his first mate and daughter Angelica. So he leads Blackbeard to the fountain Babossa leads the English and the Spanish who already know the way are also heading there, so we are watching a three way race to the fountain. The movie has a subplot that involves a mermaid (lovely French actress Astrid Bergès-Frisbey) to a missionary (Sam Claflin). And we also have to find the requirements to drink of the fountain, two silver chalices, a mermaid's tear from what we discover that this mermaids are the stone hearts of the oceans, so getting a tear from them will well go watch and find out how they did it and oh! Yes off to the Fountain of Youth. Aargh!!!.",7,0,0,6 June 2011
Men in Black 3," far better than 2
","Free falling, time travel, interesting linkage, Men in Black 3 is the answer you have been waiting for when we wondered what good will come of the MIB now when MIB 2 was a flop? Will smith pitched the idea of MIB 3 to director Barry Sonnenfeld during the shooting of MIB 2 the idea was creating a back story for Agent K which will feature Agent J going back in time.Director Barry Sonnenfeld worked on the idea and with Steven Spielberg back as Executive Producer MIB 3 is one movie I will be seeing again.Josh Brolin plays young Agent K in 1969, he did such a great job at it you'll believe you are watching K himself. Shooting was done in New York and it began in 2010.This cliff hanging action packed movie tells a tale of what happens when you arrest instead of killing the villain. An alien nicked-named Boris the animal broke out of his prison (with the help of (Nicole Scherzinger) and travels back in time to change history and kill the man that put him in jail.By doing the above he will achieve the destruction of the earth will and the death of Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones).So J (Will Smith) travels back in time to help Agent K (James Brolin) save the world again and also save his life.My high in all MIB movies is the alien characters; I have to applaud the costumes designers and the CGI developers on that. Also look out for the screenplay, as major events are happening on the screen at all times and there was never a dull moment.I like a movie with a good story depth, but here in MIB 3 the makers have one thing in mind...make a better MIB movie than the last one(Men in black two was a total blunder), you want story depth? Go watch Men In Black 1.This MIB movie does not have all the whole faithful present no Frank the pug, Jeebs or Zed.When it comes to a job well done, hey Will Smith has finally done something worthwhile in years. I am legend, Hankcock and Seven Pounds were his last movies before MIB 3 and they all lacked the things that made Will Smith a name to go queue up in the cinema for. Also a nice job by the casting crew, James Brolin was the perfect man for Young Agent K.There is talk of an MIB 4, I guess we will see. I employ you top go see this movie.",6,1,4,3 June 2012
Alien 3," I feel like throwing up all i have seen
","If for any reason other than watching the franchise preparing for Prometheus (2012), I will advice you skip this movie.I still have a bad after taste and a feeling throw up all I have seen. It may have been a big budget production, but what a waste it was. Imagine a movie that starts production without a complete script, the script itself went through 5 re-writes before starting. This to me is a sign that the movie itself didn't want to be made.But sadly to say in 1992 Alien 3 was produced and it was a mess, directed by first time movie director at that time David Fincher (alien 3 was his debut, although he has gone to direct hits after that some including Seven (1995), Fight Club (1999), The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008), The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) and more), who did a job worth getting sidelined for.As usual, the pod heading for earth got delayed and an alien was onboard and killed most of the crew on board.Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) survived and she brought with her to the Fiorina 'Fury' 161, a foundry facility and penal colony inhabited by all-male inmates, the Alien.All hell breaks loose as usual people running here and there, death everywhere, chaos, pandemonium and something growing where it should not.My very candid thought on this movie is this: Although the action was there, the suspense was not, the horror genre gone and replaced with drama. The dialogues were too long and so much pause in-between, not evenly paced and the worst part is the story was out of place, ending unbelievably annoying.I regret seeing this movie, after seeing the Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986). Done by Ridley Scott and James Cameron respectively I expected something better.All in all, watch something else.",4,0,4,7 April 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Go See this masterpiece
","One thing you have to love about 'A Game Of Shadows' is the pitch which it starts. The touch of comedy makes it enticing to the eyes and ears. With over 2 hours of watch time, Holmes delivered a enough juice to keep you watching.With a more like Jackie Chan fight scenes, lovely disguises by Holmes and it was fun to see the dynamic duo, battle together in a sheer masculine type male bonding, with Watson being the joker in every scene introducing jokes and fun as the plot untangles.Holmes brother Mycoft was also introduced, as in the books Sherlock Holmes brother was more in touch with his power of observation than Sherlock himself. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle made Holmes brother smarter and better than Holmes in his books the only different being he had more political ambition than Holmes and less interest in being a detective.Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr) is up against a criminal mastermind Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris) who is Holmes' intellectual equal. The story starts off with the death of the Crown Prince of Austria. Holmes deduces that the prince has been the victim Professor Moriarty.Holmes goes after Moriarty, but always seems to be behind all that is going on. The two masterminds start a game of who will succeed a game which Moriarty's lack of conscience led to chaos and death.The movie did have an initial faceoff between the two major players Holmes and Moriarty, a faceoff that was less exciting than I hoped.No need to say anything about the acting, as it was the main steed in the movie riding hard and strong till it crossed the finish line in front, the acting was something extraordinary, good delivery of lines, wonderful facial expressions and grand gestures; making the actors more like the character they represent than being distant from the movie, what am saying in few words is, the actors were the bomb.The scenery was well crafted to fit and suit the screenplay which (screenplay) was a grand gesture of mastery. Directing must have been made easy for Guy Ritchie (who directed the first Sherlock Holmes) as the screenplay to me did the main task. The script and dialogue won't bore you that's for sure and the cat and mouse game of Holmes and Moriarty was good to watch.The effects were great and the tragedy was endless as the collateral damage grew intensively in this movie. There was a scene that was like a war was going on.All in all, if like me you delayed to see this masterpiece, I advice you do so now before it gets away from the cinema if it hasn't already.",8,1,5,14 April 2012
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The plot is crap but Liam Neeson was awesome
","To be honest the Phantom Menace, didn't bring about the introduction I desired about the whole Stars Wars saga, but it was a nice movie by its own rights. The problem I believe is from the fact that George Lucas had all the rights to wheel and drive this movie how he pleases, that with no one questioning him, this I believe is the reason I had to deal with 2 hours or less of Jar Jar Binks, who wasn't funny but annoying and his clan was so annoying that I wished the droids wiped them out before young Anakin Skywalker could save them.Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) were the high side of this movie, I was extremely impressed by the portrayal of Qui-Gon Jinn to the point that I just wanted to be seeing Liam Neeson at all times, he was just magnificent and made the movie worth seeing and his presence made it easier to deal with the annoying Character of Jar Jar Binks and his clan.Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace is the forth film in the Star Wars saga, it came about from Lucas planning a back story that will connect and give a story depth between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, in the first Star Wars trilogy Vader is said to be Luke's father so this second trilogy is to show how Anakin (Darth Vader) was trained and swayed to the dark side. The movie main protagonist will be Anakin Skywalker, and this first movie of the sequel will be his introduction.The name Phantom Menace depicts Palpatine hiding his true identity as the evil Sith Lord. The movie follows the adventure of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi as they were to escort and protect the Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) of planet Naboo as she travels to Coruscant as she hopes to end the trade dispute between her people and the Viceroy. Their Journey wasn't a peaceful one as the Viceroy invaded Naboo and they had to flee. During their flight a breakdown of their space craft causing them to land in the planet Tatooine where they met young Anakin Skywalker and also witnessed the return of the Sith, as Qui-Gon Jinn had to defend himself from one.The CGI in the movie is not as impressive as I will expect and but the screenplay is one that will keep the interest of many, this massive box office hit was received with many mixed reviews and I myself have mixed feelings about the movie. It will be a lot easier to enjoy this movie if you have seen the first trilogy, don't try to watch the movie from here up hoping to get the feel.In conclusion, Star Wars is a wonderful franchise a movie plot that can go on and on, I did enjoy this movie but not because of the script or plot which were a 5/10 from my view but because of the performance of Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor.www.lagsreviews.com",6,1,5,2 February 2013
The Expendables 2," a wonderful nostalgic moment
","In the real sense this movie is not worth the time spent making it, but just to hear Chuck Norris reply to'I heard a rumor that you were bitten by king cobra' Chuck: After 5 days of agonizing pain, the cobra died.Made watching the movie blissful. This movie is a nostalgia put together of all our favorite heroes, even Bruce Willis took up the gun in this one, and Arnold had more screen time and used the phrase 'I'll be back' a little too much.As usual Chuck Norris was the ultimate bad ass, although he had few screen time.Stallone went all the way to add more characters to the ensemble cast; Stallone had already made plans for the sequel before the release of the first Expendables. Stallone opted out of writing or directing the sequel, and the movie was done to a PG-13 rating.Van Damme redesigned his and Stallone's characters' final fight. As he was unhappy with the scripted fight which involved his character running away.The movie plot is similar to the first a simple job gone bad as Barney and his old-school mercenaries go on a mission when things go wrong and one of their own is viciously killed, the Expendables are compelled to seek revenge in hostile territory where the odds are stacked against them.Then when it looks like lights out for the whole crew, when they were out of bullets and facing a whole army and an armored tank, Chuck Norris comes along and evens the odds.He didn't really even the odds, it wasn't fair to the army and the armored tank they were outnumbered. As we all know it takes more than one armor tank and an army to take on Chuck Norris.Now as per acting goes, this guys are all professionals and so they did well, but the script is a little out of it, the directing and the wise cracks was not part of the movie at all.The thing is the movie is just for you to enjoy the nostalgic experience. A Third installment is on the way and i look forward to seeing it as majority of the people we see here will be back.",6,1,6,24 August 2012
War Dogs," A good enough movie to see even if it is just to appreciate the performance of Jonah Hill
","War Dogs had me captivated at the way the events unfold, as we see two arms dealers try to score big. The movie tells a good story and keeps you curious on how events will turnout. The down side of this movie is we have seen such on screen pair before and while watching you have this striking feeling that the more outspoken carefree character will mess up everything for the partners, so there is no element of surprise when it finally happened.Everyone is always aiming for that one big score, but sometimes the price to pay for that score can eventually make the score a useless endeavour. That was what this movie had to deliver as we watch two childhood friends form a company AEY, which deals specifically in arms deals with the U.S. Pentagon.The movie has one of the best performances I have seen Jonah Hill pull off, he was a master of character shifts in this movie playing a greedy and intelligent Efraim Diveroli. Jonah Hill deserves all the praise he is getting for his performance and even more, as his presence takes the movie which could have been done better into what is enjoyable.War Dogs is a biographical crime drama directed by Todd Phillips. The movie plot is based on a story published in Guy Lawson's 2015 book Arms and the Dudes. Although the movie is biographical many of the elements and happenings were fictions, just wound together to make a more compelling story.What these two 20 something friends did rocked the U.S. Army and caused it to review its procurement dealers and measures.The movie is narrated by David (Miles Teller) who is a licenced massage therapist. David is tired of giving massages to old people for a living, and tried his hand on selling bedsheets to old people's home, but the business failed and David was to lose all his savings. When his old time childhood friend and bad influence Efraim shows up at a burial of a mutual acquaintance, the two hooked up and tried igniting their past fun days. After hearing about David's predicament and his unborn child on her way Efraim asked David to come join him as an arms dealer. Their work together made them enough money to buy houses and live a good life, but they always wanted more and decided to go for a big score worth $ 300 million.The problem is, they had to fool the U.S. Army to get away with it.A good enough movie to see even if it is just to appreciate the performance of Jonah Hill.www.lagsreviews.com",6,2,4,28 August 2016
The Hangover," funny as hell
","The thing that made this movie so good is that nobody saw it coming, these three guys who seemed to be lost in a world of adulthood get stuck with a baby and a missing Groom and a wedding that they need to get too, while they have no idea of what happened the night before. The movie delivers a shocker in the acting area and the script was funny to the core, that you don't feel you have seen this movie till you watch it a second time.The Hangover was a big financial success and it helped propel the careers of the three lead actors, making more than 12 times its production cost, the studio just had to make a part II, which was not as good as this initial one, as it featured same people doing practically the same thing that led to what happened in the first hangover.The movie plot was inspired by a real life event that happened to Tripp Vinson (a movie producer); Tripp had gone missing from his own Las Vegas bachelor party, blacking out and waking up in a strip club. Jon Lucas and Scott Moore took the tale and drafted a script which they sold to Warner Bros. for over $2 million. The movie director Todd Phillips, went ahead to add additional elements to the script to put in more life into it and extra adventures, he added such like Mike Tyson and his tiger, the baby, and the police cruiser.The movie plot is about Vegas gone wrong; Doug (Justin Bartha) and Tracy (Sasha Barrese) are about to get married so Doug's two best friends Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Stu (Ed Helms) decided to take him for a bachelor party in Vegas tagging along was Tracy's brother Alan (Zach Galifianakis). While in Vegas, the four had a night out, and then the worst thing happened they woke up the next day knowing they had the time of their lives but can't remember what happened. To make it worse, there is a Tiger in the bathroom, the groom Doug is missing and they are with a baby whom they know not where he came from.The movie was shot in like two weeks and it is a must watch to all movie lovers that is for sure, there is plan to make a third Hangover movie, the part II was released in 2011 it was not as critically accepted as the first, but the box office sales was just as impressive so with that on their side the studio will be taking a chance with a part three. Filming of The Hangover Part III began in September 2012 and is set for release in May 2013.www.lagsreviews.com",8,1,2,17 December 2012
Iron Man 3," It was nice, full of comic and Iron Man suits
","I have not been a huge fan of any movie that drags longer than just two parts, for that reason I delayed in watching this new Iron man, in fact the last one wasn't so great so I wasn't expecting much here, but boy was I impressed. When Disney took over Marvel this was one movie that I knew took in some cash to get done and I was skeptical, as to me cash is not what makes good movies, it is good stories, well Iron man 3 had a good story and the supporting cast were just off the hook. The movie had a nice comic feel, and the action scenes were relentless, the writers were always leaving me speechless by the turn of events making me eager to see where the movie was going.The writers decided to keep all things on the level of science, in the Iron Man comic book series the Mandarin is his archenemy and he is portrayed to be a genius scientist and an extremely skilled martial artist. The Mandarin showcases some powers which sources are ten power rings that he adapted from the alien technology of a crashed space ship. Here in this movie the Mandarin is just a face of the true villain and there is no evidence of him having a common sense, the move had a pure scientific genius hiding behind the face of Mandarin.The movie picks up with a flash back of when Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) was having a New Year's Eve party, there he met scientist Maya Hansen. Maya was working on an invention called Extremis—an experimental regenerative treatment intended to allow recovery from crippling injuries. Maya wanted to work with Stark to make this drug work, but Stark rejected the offer.Years later, Stark's experiences during the alien invasion of New York were making him restless. Out of that he built several dozen Iron Man suits, all tied to work with his subconscious, this act created friction with his girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). A terrorist called the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) has been the orchestrator of a string of bombings all done with no forensic evidence to trace the type of bomb used. When Stark Industries security chief Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) is badly injured in one such attack, Stark overcomes his stupor and issues a televised threat to the Mandarin.That led to Mandarin retaliating bringing down Starks home and the world thought Stark died, so Stark used his now presume state to hunt down the Mandarin and discovered that the Mandarin is not who he thought he is.This movie is clearing cash in the box office, and I believe it will cross the 1 billion mark soon, so if you have not seen this movie, I wonder what you are waiting forwww.lagsreviews.com",7,1,2,16 May 2013
The Ring," just wait till the end
","The movie does posses some really disturbing imagery, but the movie makers didn't rely on that, what they did was they made the story tasteful that will draw you the viewer in, the movie main plot may be ridiculous but the delivery is masterful, the cinematography and the effects were good enough and the movie delivers the chills that horror movies are suppose to make you feel.The problem with this movie will have to be the actors themselves, I felt they were not just the right set of people to have been used to deliver this movie, although Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean 1, 2 and 3) directing was masterful and was able to outclass the actors poor delivery you will still notice a lax that makes you wonder how greater this movie would have been if it had been done by other actors in it.Tagged as the best Japanese Horror remake ever, this movie is a remake of the 1998 Japanese horror film Ringu. The films are based on Kôji Suzuki's novel named Ringu, the book is about a mysterious cursed videotape, which contains some disturbing images. After the viewer is done watching the tape, the viewer gets a call, upon which she hears a girl's voice telling the viewer that he/she will die in seven days.The movie plot is similar in foundation to that of the book, it features a journalist who is investigating the death of four teenagers, there is a weird tale going around that the death of this teenagers was caused by the videotape that they saw. Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) the journalist took the tape home, and she and her son watched it (not intentionally though).Now Rachel has to race against time to save her life and her son's from a mysterious girl.The Ring was met with considerable amount of criticism but most of which were positive, it was also a financial success, production cost was 48 million and the move raked in over 240 million dollars, such numbers led to the studio making a second part to this wonderful horror movie. The sequel still bordered around the events of the first film, but it was not as good as the first.If you have not got the time to sit down to see this horror flick, maybe you should, just to get the fun of the chills, I guarantee that this movie will make you smile, smile in fear.www.lagsreviews.com",8,1,1,17 December 2012
Raiders of the Lost Ark," A nice beginning to the hero we love so much
","Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark is the first of the Indiana Jones franchise that spawn out 3 sequels, a TV series and numerous video games. It is a classic and stood above many in the box office raking in over $380 million dollars. It also won 4 Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects, Best Sound, Best Film Editing and Best Art Direction.The movie pulls surprises after surprises, like what happened when the Ark was opened, that scene alone is not something you will expect as it starts from the time it was opened till when it was shut, you will be stunned.It packages in its 115 minutes run, a bolder chase, arrow flying here and there, submarine, car chase, gun fights, drama, comedy, adventure, Nazis, Gestapo, Arabian men and Spiritual power in high places, all this for your fun and view, in a movie that is shot in numerous locations.There was a scene where Indy is trapped in the well of souls with over 7,000 snakes, now that is a sight you really want to see. The car chase reminded me of the Mad Max movie Road Warrior it was intense, fun and dangerous.The movie plot has our favorite hero, trying to get a solid-gold idol somewhere in the Peruvian jungle in 1936. He gets it then loses the artifact to his rival and the movie antagonist who is French archaeologist named Belloq (Paul Freeman).Indy is recruited by the Army Intelligence to stop the Nazi's who seem to be after the Ark of Covenant so as to gain power to topple the world.So Indy saddles up and goes to Nepal to meet with his Mentor Ravenwood only to discover that he had died, so he is left to ride along Marion (Karen Allen) his daughter to Cairo where they meet Indy's sidekick Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) as they team up to stop the Nazis.The movie is one joy ride from place to place the movie had quite an interesting bunch of characters that will keep you both thrilled and entertained, one character that catches my fancy was the Gestapo. Raiders of the Lost Ark is set to be a sequel to the movie that came after it, as Temple of Doom was set in 1935. The movie has received numerous acclaim ranked 66 in the AFI's top 100 movies 10th Anniversary and also ranked 10th in AFI's top ten thrills.Here is Indiana Jones at the very beginning an intro to the character that we all love and admire, I believe there is no reason why you should not have seen this classic.www.lagsreviews.com",7,2,3,9 November 2012
Casablanca," Everyone should watch this movie
","Here is a movie that has always found a way to remain in the top of the lists when it comes to the best movies ever done.Casablanca crosses the genre of drama and romance, the acting was top notch and the movie's screenplays were so well done, that you will be torn in two for Lily. Humphrey Bogart (Rick) was the perfect prince charming, and also a hero in all ways including love.Done in 1942 Casablanca is based on an unproduced play named 'Everybody Comes to Rick's' by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison.The movies ending is one that I love and is something you can skip back to watch again, the dramatic scene, which showed sacrifice, love and suspense. The twist at the end is something the producers would have slipped in to catch the audience off guard, something I enjoyed.Casablanca's lines ('Here is looking at you kid' and 'This Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship') have remained on the lips of many and it has fondly been repeated in more movies than I can bet the producers would have even dreamt.So what is this great movie about? Casablanca's plot is set during the early years of World War 2, In Casablanca (Morocco) the is a man named Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) who owns the most popular handout spot in Casablanca, he had everything under control and he even had influence on the police. Everything was fine till the past came knocking.Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) an old lover of Rick shows up at Rick's nightclub and sparks were sent flying in both ways, as they lost contact (Ilsa's fault) without any explanations.Ilsa is not alone, with her is her husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henereid) who is a renowned fugitive Czech Resistance leader.The couple needs letters to escape to America, letters only Rick can give. So Rick is in a dilemma to help the woman he loves escape with her husband or keep her in Casablanca.Nominated for eight (8) Academy Awards, Casablanca went home with 3, Best Picture, Best director and Best writing screenplay, Casablanca is a commercial success and has a strong cult following, which has disturbed any plans for a sequel and also the colorization of the movie.The movie cinematography was done by the cinematographer of the movie Frankenstein (1931), who made sure that any time we get to see Bergman her eyes sparkled.Here is a movie, AFI has ranked the 3rd greatest of all time in their AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition). I advise you get a taste of Casablanca, an iconic movie that sets the trend of what a true romantic movie should be about.www.lagsreviews.com",9,2,3,12 November 2012
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Well you will enjoy it
","I wasn't holding on to my seat as I watched, wasn't jumping for joy as the bad guys get axed, wasn't thrilled by the lines either but I loved the way Lincoln handled the axe.The movie is based on the 2010 novel of the same name. The film was directed and co-produced by Timur Bekmambetov, along with one of my favourite film makers Tim Burton. Like in the movie poster, the real life figure of Lincoln is seen to identify him as a vampire hunter.Anthony Mackie was the high note in the movie, as he played Abe's long time friend Will, who later joined in the hunt of the un-dead.The plot is a little loose, as it portrays vampires as one of the pioneers of slave trade. In Lincoln's attempt to stop their reign and expansion, the American civil war broke out. With men going after vampires that can only be killed by silver, it was a massacre, till Abe stepped up to the task; willing the axe all over the place, with his life almost cut short a couple of times, he managed to wipe them out.The script is everywhere, the tale is a little shallow, and something's didn't add up. But maybe it was me, but I expected better cinematography, wasn't so thrilled by some camera angles. Tim Burton's presence can be felt in the directing style and the actors kinda grew into their roles.Unlike the mock buster Abraham Lincoln vsZombies, this movie had Abe start with no beards, just a young man out for revenge. After he got into politics the beards showed.Also the movie didn't have wise cracks like the mock buster. Anthony did well here compared to the mockery acting displayed in the movie, Man On The Ledge. Benjamin Walker is a new face to me, but I guess he will now be known as the man who played Abraham Lincoln.Go see it, it was OK.",6,4,7,27 June 2012
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Becareful you may laugh yourself to death
","Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a wonderful fantasy comedy directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future (1985), Mars Needs Moms (2011), Real Steel (2011) and Flight (2012))and done by Spielberg's Amblin Studios and Disney's Touchstone pictures. It combines live action and animation in a blend that made it match up to the fit of Disney's Mary Poppins which till date is Disney's most Oscar nominated film and it went home with 5 wins. Like Mary Poppins live action and animation combination that came out grand, so did this, although unlike Mary Poppins, where the animation and the characters hardly interact, in this movie they seem to be always around each other.This interaction was so well done that you have to give kudos to the animators and animation directors.The movie plot is about a cartoon star Roger Rabbit whose wife was caught on camera by a P.I. Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) playing pattycake with another man. That man soon ends up dead and Roger is being accused for the murder. Now Roger has no hope but to run to the toon hating P.I. Eddie who took the pictures in the first place, now both are stuck together as they try to figure out why someone will be trying to frame Roger Rabbit.The screenplay is written by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman (who also worked together on Dr' Seuss screenplay adaptation of How The Grinch Stole Christmas (2000)) and is based on Gary K. Wolf's 1981 novel named Who Censored Roger Rabbit? Both book and movie depict a world in which cartoon characters interact directly with human beings.Who Framed Roger Rabbit won 4 Oscars and it was a critical acclaim, many enjoyed the comic and the fun story the movie carries and at the time of its production it was one of the most expensive animations ever made. Its production cost was 70 million dollars and it was a box office success making over 320 million in its time of release.In conclusion, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a classic animation from the 80s that all should get the chance to see even if it is just once. Talks are going about that Disney is in talks with Amblin (Steven Spielberg) and even director Robert Zemeckis to make a sequel to this fine film, although Bob Hoskins has retired from acting, I feel that the writers can still come up with something we all want to see.www.lagsreviews.com",7,0,0,5 March 2013
Minority Report," wow, Spielberg's idea of the future
","The movie pulls out the debate of freewill. Is freewill truly freewill if my future actions are known before hand. The Bible makes us know that God knows the end from the beginning, and that he hand crafted us, so those that mean we have freewill or are we just a piece of a big puzzle.Minority Report answers that question by saying even if the future is known, the path can still be changed it is just a matter of determination. Set 50 years into the future, this classic is about a future where the criminals are arrested before they commit the crime.The story itself was written by Philip K. Dick and it was supposed to be a sequel to the 1990 Dick adaptation of the movie Total Recall, which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger. When the sequel was not forth coming, novelist Jon Cohen was hired in 1997 to adapt the story for a potential film version. Cruise got a hold of the script and passed it on to Spielberg, with the hope that they will make a movie together from it. Spielberg liked the script but decided it need to be improved upon and so Cohen did another draft and Cruise and Spielberg decided to go in together to make the movie, both deciding not to take any money upfront but to share a percentage of the gross profit.Boasting of high tech graphics and CGI, this futuristic film looked certain, like if God willing we are all here in the next 50 years that movie looked like what it will be.The movie plot centers on the Lead Character John Anderton. In April 2054, Captain John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is chief of the Washington, D.C. PreCrime police force. Thanks to their proficiency and effectiveness and intense use future visions generated by three 'precogs', (these precogs are mutated humans with precognitive abilities) to stop murders, the city of Washington has been murder free for 6 years. The moment the murderers think it up in their mind this precogs sends a visual message and the culprit is picked up before the crime is committed.Things change for Anderton soon enough, that while the system is being audited by Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell), the precogs predict that Anderton will murder a man named Leo Crow in 36 hours.Anderton is surprised because he knows no Leo Crow, so now breaks loose and is on the run stealing one of the precogs in order to help clear his name.Listed as one of the best films of 2002, this financial success is one of the best surveillance and futuristic films out there a movie to watch again and again.www.lagsreviews.com",8,0,0,20 December 2012
Chinatown," a crime drama at its best
","Chinatown is a crime mystery psychological drama film; the screenplay in this 1974 classic is one that is way beyond its time and it will take years before another masterful screenplay can match the Academy Award winning screenplay of Chinatown. The screenplay was done by the Robert Towne (who you will know for his writing in the Tom Cruise Movies The Firm in 1993 Mission Impossible in 1996 and Mission Impossible II in 2000) who decide not to adapt the novel The Great Gatsby (1974) handed to him by producer Robert Evans but Towne wrote his own and Chinatown was the result of his writing.The movie had a tragic ending with Robert Evans the producer, intending the screenplay to have a happy ending but Polanski stuck to his gun for a tragic ending, he is quoted to have said 'I knew that if Chinatown was to be special, not just another thriller where the good guys triumph in the final reel, Evelyn had to die.' Director Roman Polanski (who won the Oscars for Best Director for the 2002 movie The Pianist) won a Golden Globe award for Best Director for this movie, Polanski shut the whole movie from the sight of J.J. Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) he was in every scene of the movie and when he was knocked out the who screen went black till he woke up.The movie plot is about a private investigator J.J. Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson), whose main job is tailing partner's clients who are suspected to be having affairs.He was hired by a woman to help find out if her husband Hollis I. Mulwray is having an affair, he tails him and finds him with another woman, takes pictures of them and releases them to the papers, all to get sued the next day by the woman Mulwary was with, as Gittes found out that the woman who hired him is actually a phony and that the woman he taught was Mulwray's mistress was actually Mulwray's real wife.Polanski also appears in this movie in a cameo as the gangster who cuts Gittes' nose.A sequel to this classic was titled The Two Jakes which was released in 1990. Jack Nicholson reprises his role as J.J. Jake Gittes and also directed the movie, with Robert Towne returning to write the screenplay. The sequel was a total failure though.Chinatown is one of the few mystery films that will keep you on your seat till the very end as you eagerly wait to see where the entire strings tie up, as the movie composes plots and sub plots all leading to a grand and memorable ending.www.lagsreviews.com",8,1,2,19 November 2012
Se7en," A wonderful thriller
","There is no crazier movie in the 90s that can cause to feel uneasy like the way Se7en did. Seven used imagery and your ability to imagine the insanity level of the perpetuator, to thrill you. The whole idea of using a gore scene to take majority of the movie's screen time and then satisfy the weird nature of some viewers was totally eliminated and the movie just focused mostly on character development which many may see as boring but it (the movie) still carried on to be a masterpiece. When you see the way the co-stars interact you will just bow in respect to their mastery of acting. Morgan Freeman played the old father figure and a detective who has seen too much of the streets and is so eager to retire and leave it all behind, while Brad Pitt played the younger cop, who is full of energy and is ready to jump off roof tops and chase down bad guys. The movie also made use of an array of supporting actors that are very good on their own to star in a film, actors like Gwyneth Paltrow, R. Lee Ermey, and Kevin Spacey, were also onboard in this thriller.Seven features the newly transferred David Mills (Brad Pitt) and the soon to retire William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) as homicide detectives who become deeply involved in a case about a sadistic serial killer whose accurately planned murders corresponding to the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, pride, lust, and envy.The movie's name is seven but it is mostly characterized by Se7en and it is a most see in many levels. The thrill that the movie brings and the chemistry of the co-stars is one that you will not just find lying around in any movie. Seven became the first of 3 films that director David Fincher and actor Brad Pitt did together (that is as of now 2013) the others were The Fight Club (1999) and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008).The movie was a massive hit in the 90s and it was a both a critical and a commercial success as the 30 million budget brought in over 327 million in the box office. Andrew Kevin Walker received a BAFTA Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay and the editor Richard Francis-Bruce was nominated for an Academy Award for Film Editing. Seven won the MTV movie award as the best film in its year.If you haven't seen Seven before or you are in the mood of another fun thrilling ride as we chase down Kevin Spacey, then make time to see this movie again.www.lagsreviews.com",7,2,4,14 May 2013
Fight Club," not to be mistaken as a violent film with no purpose, this is a classic
","This movie can be miss construed as a perpetuator of violence, but the movie is a tough showcase of manhood, where men take it out on each other all in the name of the thrill of adrenalin. It takes a while to get into loving Fight Club, but the moment you are hooked, it will be one movie you will like to own. The movie showcased a good cinematography, as most of the events in the movie took place at night, the director and the cinematographer had to make the best of extra florescent lights, and using locations that had well lighted street lights.Fight Club is based on the 1996 novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk. The film was directed by David Fincher (Seven (1995) and The Curious Case of Benjamin Franklin (2008) both also stared Brad Pitt) the movie has an unnamed narrator which is played by Edward Norton. The narrator (Norton) tells us about his life, we learn about his white collar job and how he lived an everyday routine life which he got tired of, took break off the routine he started something that became so big that he himself could not control.The Unnamed narrator started a club with his new friend from a bar Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), the club featured men taking it out on each other, fighting bare fist just for the thrill.The club grew and became a cross country thing, with Tyler and the unnamed narrator seen as the club presidents and they take turns going around to see that the club is well run, in the various locations.Prepping up for their roles both Pitt and Norton took lessons in boxing, taekwondo, grappling and soap making. Pitt further went ahead to Chip some of his tooth so as not to look too perfect. Filming lasted over 138 days with over 300 scenes, the fight scenes were heavily choreographed with the actors going all out, so as to make it look more realistic.Here is a movie that I highly recommend you get the DVD, but I do have to warn you that it does posses extreme violence, as we see men go bear fist fight with one another, but the movie twist ending is far more captivating than the violence that at the end you are more glad with the way the movie is taking form than you are worried with the intense fight scenes.www.lagsreviews.com",8,0,1,17 December 2012
Citizen Kane," this is a movie classic
","Whether this movie is overrated or not, Citizen Kane tops the list of many reviewers.This 1941 drama film, was directed, written and starred Orson Welles. Who was at that time making his directorial debut. Citizen Kane is a movie that i may not boldly say go watch, but if you like the art of film making then this is one classic you should see.The high points in the movie will have to be the story telling, based primarily on flashbacks. The movie is about a man named Charles Foster Kane a newspaper magnate, played by Orson Welles, whose story is loosely based on the lives of four men, American newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, Chicago tycoons Samuel Insull and Harold McCormick and some aspects of Welles's own life.Narrated principally through flashbacks, the story of Charles Foster Kane is revealed through the research of a newsreel reporter, who was seeking to uncover the mystery of the newspaper magnate (Charles Foster Kane) dying word: 'Rosebud'.The thrill in this movie is how it moves from flashback to real time in such powerful continuity that makes you respect the art. If you are to compare this movie to such like Inception and co, you may view it as an overrated classic, the cinematography is one for the books and the story is masterful.Viewing the film with an objective look that it was made in 1941 in black and white, where no CGI is available at all but we have makeup artist doing their absolute best to make sure that you are carried along in the growth of Kane himself.Then the question comes to play in your heart, the portrayal of the character, Orson did so well at various stages in the life of Kane that he convinces you that he either most have known Kane before in a previous life.The directing style of Orson too is something to talk about, making the story based only on the life of Kane and making the newspaper reporter kind of anonymous.The story of the movie depicts a man who had everything but lacked empathy, this makes you the audience either judge his actions or commend them as brave.The film was nominated for nine Academy Awards but took home one for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) by Herman Mankiewicz and Welles. It has topped many reviewers 'greatest film ever made' lists such as that of Sight & Sound's decennial poll, the AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies list and its 10th Anniversary Update.This movie is a classic true and true.www.lagsreviews.com",7,0,1,25 October 2012
Memento," This is not just a movie it is art
","Memento is not just a movie it is an artwork, an artwork with editing at its best, continuity at its max and a script that just draws you in. The screenplay is masterful as you are watching the movie from back to front; you get to feel like Leonard himself.Memento is written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who adapted it from his younger brother Jonathan Nolan's (Person of Interest creator, writer and executive producer) short story 'Memento Mori'.The brothers started work on the film in 1996 when Jonathan pitched the story to Christopher on a road trip, the two then started to send story and script back and forth as Christopher developed his film from a short story about a man named Earl who is a patient of a mental institution. Earl's wife like Leonard was killed by an anonymous man, and during the attack Earl lost his ability to create new long-term memories and convinces himself through written notes to himself to escape the mental institution and track down and kill his wife murder.The movie starts at the end and runs till we get to see what led to the end. The movie is told in two different parallel series of scenes, one of which is in black and white and it is shown chronologically, and the other is in colored and shown in a reverse order sequence. The two stories meet at the end of the film, and it shows us what led to the beginning of the film.The movie plot is about a man named Leonard (Guy Pearce) who has anterograde amnesia, which makes it difficult for him to retain new explicit memories. To be able to keep tab on his life Leonard developed a system where he uses notes, tattoos and Polaroid photos to be able to track where he is and who he knows and what he is doing or about to do.Leonard's problem started when he got hit in the head when he witnessed his wife being raped and murdered; now Leonard has only one goal in life to track down a certain John G who he believes killed his wife.Rated as one of the best movies in the 2000s, Memento is featured in notable lists of top films. Memento was very successful at the box office making almost 10 times its production cost and placing Nolan's name in the lips of many production studios, inclusive of Warner Bros where Christopher Nolan made The Batman Trilogy and will be working with them for the making of the new Superman film named Man of Steel in 2013.Memento received numerous accolades and got two Academy Awards nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Editing. There is nothing better than for you to take the time to see this classic.www.lagsreviews.com",8,1,3,7 December 2012
Coraline," it is good enough to enjoy
","Coraline is a dark horror fantasy stop motion 3D animation that just sticks out in your mind as one creepy movie. It stalls you and keeps you in the dark as you try to decipher where the terror will be coming from, and when it does arrive, you find yourself wishing this is one of those films that the good guy wins, although there are numerous of them this just got to be one.Coraline doesn't strike me as a film for children although it does carry a message of how you should be thankful of what you have, the grass may look greener on the other side but there may be a high price to pay to get there and stay there.Coraline is based on a book of the same name by British author Neil Gaiman (who also wrote the novel Stardust that was to a film adapted of the same name in 2007), it was published in 2002 winning the 2003 Hugo Award for Best Novella, the 2003 Nebula Award for Best Novella, and the 2002 Bram Stoker Award for Best Work for Young Readers. It was later adapted by Henry Selick (he was also the director of the 1993 The Nightmare Before Christmas) into this movie that we are going to talk about.The movie plot is about a girl named Coraline Jones (Dakota Fanning) who she her parents moved into an old house that has been subdivided into flats. The other tenants were Miss Spink and Miss Forcible two elderly stage actors and Mr. Bobinski, who is training a mouse circus.One rainy day she discovers a locked door in her room, which has been bricked up, strangely as she goes to visit her neighbors, Mr. Bobinsky delivers a message to her telling her not to go through the door.But Coraline ignores the warnings and goes through the door which leads her to a parallel version of her house where she meets her other mother and other father, who were better and treated her better than her real mother and father, the difference was the people in the other world have buttons for eyes.Coraline was well received by critics and did averagely well in the box office, although the game version of the film received very poor ratings. Henry Selick will be making another Neil Gaiman book adaptation named The Graveyard Book, who knows maybe the movie will also be a stop motion animation.www.lagsreviews.com",6,0,0,25 December 2012
Alien: Resurrection," Not bad
","The fourth installment in the Alien Franchise was Alien Resurrection which had Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), cloned after she died 200 years ago in Alien 3. The cloned Ripley had in her, the DNA of the Alien so what they company had 'CLONED' was a hybrid, a human and the alien DNA mixed.The new Ripley had in her chest the Queen Embryo, which was removed as soon as the cloning process was a success, and she was studied and she bred a new kind of Alien.Well, the company also had Alien eggs and they captured men in hyper-sleep and used them to breed the Alien. They caged them and tried to train them but soon the Aliens got smart and broke free and again all hell broke loose.What makes this last installment to the franchise good was the suspense, in every turn there is something you thought you had figured out till it changes the next second making the story also dynamic. Written by Joss Whedon, who had worked on Buffy the Vampire slayer before this, the story and screenplay had enough action to keep you on the edge of your sit.The actors were on their toes delivering their lines and their interpretation of character with finesse. Another thing that did it for me was the idea to use the Alien's blood as part of the script, not much about this acid blood has occurred in the previous two installments. But here it played a vital role in the story.It was also directed by another director, a French director Jean-Pierre who I have to give kudos to, as he did a fine job in delivery. The CGI and the effects in this installment was better than all previous 3 put together, and it has to be said even though this is not better than 2 (Aliens (1986)), it redeemed the image of the franchise.All in all, it is not a bad re watch.",7,4,5,11 April 2012
12 Angry Men," Nice courtroom drama, a classic
","This courtroom drama is rated second in AFI's 10 Top 10 Courtroom Drama, behind the classic To Kill A Mockingbird. Although the movie is not as great as To Kill AMockingbird, it does boast of excellent acting skills and a nice view of how the human mind works.Most of the entire movie took place in the jury room. The total time spent outside of the jury room was three minutes out of the full 96 minutes of the movie and the time in the Jury room exposes you to how judgemental the world is.This drama film was adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose, whose screenplay for 12 Angry Men was initially produced for the CBS program Studio One in 1954.The film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt that was brought up by one of the jurors. Juror 8 (Henry Fonda) was the juror that brought up the basis of reasonable doubt. He was the movie's protagonist.Juror 8 had the herculean task of proving to the others that his reasonable doubt was valid since In the United States (both then and now), a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous.As the movie went on, you will see how some of the jurors were seeing things from the view of juror 8 and how some remained adamant.The movie's main antagonist was juror 3 a stubborn disrespectful man, who no matter what some of the others were able to prove stood his ground, by doing so he kept some of the jurors at his side of the defendant being guilty.'12 Angry Men' was remade for television in 1997. Directed by William Friedkin, the remake starred Jack Lemmon as one of the jurors. Most of the action and dialogue of the film are identical to the original. Although there was no smoking in the jury room and concentration shifted to income and pop culture.12 angry men's teleplay has been adapted to many TV series over the years some of these include Hancock's Half Hour, Picket Fences, Perfect Strangers, Family Matters, The Dead Zone, Early Edition, The Odd Couple, King of the Hill, Matlock, 7th Heaven, Veronica Mars, Monk, Hey Arnold!, Peep Show (TV series), My Wife and Kids, Robot Chicken, and The Simpsons.The movie is exceptionally captivating and you will not regret the time you spent watching this movie.www.lagsreviews.com",7,0,1,13 October 2012
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Nice movie to go watch with your girl
","We are familiar in seeing Steve Carell in all round crazy comedies like, Get Smart, Date Night and others. This movie drops in a different category all together as we see him play a comic role but had to put some serious dramatic energy in it, to make the character not look phony. If you are not a huge fan of the whole, romantic comedy flicks, this movie is a set aside for all. Starting all cliché-ish, Steve Carell plays Cal Weaver a Mr. Nice guy who's wife cheated on him and to add insult to injury, she tells him this to his face on their way home from dinner which ended abruptly when she dropped the divorce bomb. Cal all bumped out starts to hang in a bar gets drunk and talks on and on about his wife (Julianne Moore) cheating on him. He meets Jacob (Ryan Gosling) who takes him under his wing and turns him to a lady magnet. From here the movie goes through the same tunnel as others, the hunk mentor falls in love and protégé ends up not wanting to quit the game, the movie then adds twists and turns with an enlighten ending. The scripts from Dan Fogelman and direction from 'Bad Santa' writers Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, we are presented with a perfect ensemble cast, which delivers in both comedy and drama to keep you watching to the very end.The only problem with the movie is just the fact that it is predictable, as we have been dealt in various dosages of romantic movies going in this trend, but known has a 13 year old boy who was insanely in love with a 17 year old, I will give the writers that. Also to add the 17 year old was in love with Cal.Marisa Tomei, joins the cast as the first girl Cal, lands in the sack.The thing about reviewing a romantic comedy is trying not to reveal all the plot and at the end , killing the fun, so you want to go to the cinemas with your girl?

Ted," Other than the occasional laughs, you are not missing anything if you skip watching this in the cinema.
","Seth MacFarlane, who is the creator of family guy, wrote and directed the movie, this is his directorial debut, and I may not be watching his second work. I am not a huge fan of family guy, the whole idea baffles me. But no matter, i see Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis, i just expect to have a good time, which i didn't have.Wahlberg and Kunis combination was great on screen, they gelled together and there were the best thing to see on the screen. The movie dragged with profanity and too much sexual reference, i just kept waiting for the next thing to happen as each scene dragged and i wish i could just skip ahead.The computer animation was handled by visual effects facilities Tippett Studio (who were responsible for the way back when Robocop series and the more recently The Smurfs). MacFarlane wrote the screenplay with his Family Guy colleagues Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild, and they must have thought there were writing for a cartoon, because some events that happened were totally ridiculous, a teddy bear and sex, that is both loony, perverted and ridiculous in so many ways.The plot is simple: as the result of a childhood wish, John Bennett's (Mark Wahlberg) teddy bear, Ted, came to life, as John grew so did the bear, in attitude voice and reason, but things started to change when Lori (Mila Kunis) comes into the picture, John has to grow up, but Ted keeps him grounded.Acting by the leads is an A+ from me; i was actually impressed by Mark Whalberg, not saying he is bad at what he does just saying i was impressed. Directing and screenplay D-, some scenes were just too dull for me.Whalberg was in Contraband and The Fighter (with Christian Bale) before this movie, i was not too much of a fan of Contraband, but the fighter was just a legendary movie to watch. Mila Kunis was also in the movie Max Payne with Whalberg. Mila jumped at me from the movie The Book of Eli and later on Black Swan, i see her growing to be a regular on the silver screen.Well, Ted is a movie all we want to see, some loved it, a few didn't i am of the few, may be you go see it yourself and let me know what you think.",5,12,24,6 July 2012
Finding Nemo," you just have to see this
","Since the day I saw this movie it has always stood as my all time best animation and my all time Disney favorite. It is funny, entertaining and captivating as we watch a father clown fish Marlin (Albert Brooks) is thrown into a state of desperation to save his son and he goes through all form of adventures in his dying need to make sure he keeps his promise of letting nothing happen to him, his son Nemo (Alexander Gould). Nemo was captured by underwater divers, and taken to Sydney. So Marlin (Nemo's Father) went on an unwilling adventure to save his son, with him was Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) a fish who suffers from short term memory loss.There is not much to add but this is a classic that all should see, not because of the high ratings and the accolades and records that it holds, but for the gentle breeze of a cool soothing story that can only bring smiles to the face of any viewer.Written and directed by Andrew Stanton (WALL-E 2008, the Toy Story trilogy), this computer animated master piece was at its time the highest grossing animated film, and the 3rd highest of all time behind Toy Story 3 and Lion King both of which are also Disney movies, it also holds the record as the highest selling DVD of all time, selling over 40 Million copies by 2006. It also won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature during its time and the American Film Institute named it the tenth greatest animated film ever made during their Top 10 Animated Films of all time.The movie idea is based on a series of experiences by the director Andrew Stanton. As a child, he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, believing that the fishes were gotten from the ocean and wanted to go back. Also when he took his son for a walk in the park his overprotective nature made him feel he lost a father-son experience. He also stated (to the National Geographic Magazine) that the idea of using clownfish as his leads, came from when he saw a picture of two clownfish peeking out of an anemone.Funny thing is that Stanton casted Ellen to play Dory the forgetful fish when he said he saw Ellen DeGeneres in her show Ellen 'change the subject five times before finishing one sentence' (quoting Stanton from Finding Nemo Commentary)Finding Nemo is one movie that you just sit and enjoy as the graphics are good, the story is engaging and there seems to be something happening at every point in time; from the strike of the barracuda, till the reunion and eventual happy ending of a father and son tale Finding Nemo is more than just a cartoon is a needed experience, a necessity for all movie watchers of all kind.Disney plans a sequel to be released in 2016, with Stanton coming back as writer and probably director.www.lagsreviews.com",9,0,1,25 December 2012
Constantine," I loved the action
","This is one of my favorite action horror films, after getting use to seeing Keanu Reeves as Neo in The Matrix I never expected to see him pull off another character that I would love. The thing i seem to like about this movie is how Keanu Reeves manages to keep his demeanour on the sad, weird don't care attitude all throughout the movie, the world coming to an end didn't even seem to move him, his selfish ambition to make heaven by all cause pushed him off the edge of sane behaviour to a point where you start to wonder if this guy is real.The film is based on a comic book character and the screenplay was done by Kevin Brodbin and Frank Capello, taking stories from the Hellblazer comic book, and the main plot elements were taken from the 'Dangerous Habits' story arc and the 'Original Sins' trade paperback. John Constantine is a character created by popular comic book writer/creator Alan Moore; the character was given his own comic book title, Hellblazer in 1988 and it was published by DC Comics under its Vertigo Comics imprint.John Constantine is a man with the ability to perceive and communicate with half-angels and half-demons in their true form. After an attempted suicide gone wrong John's soul is eternal damned to go to hell. Constantine then goes on an exorcism rampage sending demons back to Hell so as to win enough favour to get to heaven.His quest led him to meet a troubled police detective, whose sister just committed suicide; while they work together to unravel the truth behind it, the stumble upon a plot for world destruction.Similarities and differences can be found in the portrayal of the character, from his appearance to the reason of his damnation. John Constantine is British in the comic book, other than the American as he is portrayed in the film. His reason for damnation was also changed in the film, his ability to see half breeds for who they really are (which is not an ability he posses in the comic book) was the reason he tried to kill himself leading to his damnation. In the comic book the reason for his damnation was his involvement in the summoning of a demon that killed a young girl.Received with mixed reviews, Constantine is not one that many will like, but there is something about the after taste this movie gives you, the idea that an ongoing action packed battle is going on here on earth for the winning of souls, was fun to think of.The movie does have some inconsistency that looks too large that the makers actually missed it, they made God look a little weak, like things were going on and he just let it, also the devil being taken unawares by a coup, all this made it look like God and the Devil don't have a hold on their minions.www.lagsreviews.com",7,1,2,20 December 2012
Rise of the Guardians," Something that wont bore you and exciting for you and the family
","Lacking in a good story, the fun you get from seeing this flick is the fast pace action and the fun effects when light (Sandy) takes on darkness (Pitch). The movie's fast pace is filled with some fun dialogues, but the story does lack in the area of suspense, so at any time there is always a telling of how it was going to end. The voice acting is not bad also, Alec Baldwin pulled off a nice Russian accent in his role as Santa.Rise of the Guardians is a movie filled with so much excitement all arousing from a good screenplay and the action scenes are the best, the special effects used to depict both Pitch and Sandy is exceptional, and stands out all through the movie.The movie is based on a short film named The Man in the Moon a CG animated short film done in 2005 by Aimesworth Amusements a computer animation company. The short film was based on a book series called The Guardians of Childhood by William Joyce (art designer for Toy Story (1995) and A Bug's Life (1998)). The short film was the foundation and basis of this film Rise of the Guardians. Dreamworks bought the right to the film from Aimesworth in 2008 and William Joyce was on board as an executive producer.Rise of the Guardians is a 2012 3D computer animated fantasy adventure film, which was set 200 years after the books stories. The movie's plot is about the Guardians which were North or Santa Claus (Alec Baldwin), the Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher), Bunnymund or the Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman), and the Sandman. The Guardians were facing an evil spirit known as Pitch (Jude Law) who wanted to take over the world by coating it with fear.The Guardians then had to join forces to take on their common enemy who wanted to wipe them off the board by making children stop believing in them, to do this he clouded their minds with fear. The Guardians then enlisted Jack Frost (Chris Pine) to help stop Pitch. Frost is 300 years old in the business of being frost and he seemed to be the only spirit that seemed to be able to match Pitch.The movie is more like an introductory story to who Jack Frost was before he became Jack Frost, and what his driving force is.There are possibilities of a sequel which could be a journey showing us the genesis of each of the other Guardians, but the making of such depends heavily on the box office performance of this one. The movie is fun to watch and is a good one to go see with your family.www.lagsreviews.com",6,2,5,29 November 2012
Yes Man," It is half bad
","Here is a movie about a man who decided to say yes to everything, at the beginning I was actually having fun watching him do it, after a while it became a drag then it was just stupid.The movie is based on a memoir of the same name by British humourist Danny Wallace. The book tells of the 6-month period in which he committed himself to saying 'Yes' to everything based on a brief conversation with a stranger he met on the bus.The movie acting and stunts were cool, especially when I found out that Jim Carrey did some of his stunts, even breaking 3 ribs during the process. The movie tells the story of a bank loan officer Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) has become withdrawn since his divorce from ex-wife Stephanie (Molly Sims). Routinely ignoring his friends Pete (Bradley Cooper) and Rooney (Danny Masterson), he has an increasingly negative outlook on his life.He got invited to a seminar where he is told to change and be a Yes Man, an advice Carl took literal and started to say yes to everything and everyone that comes his way.It first all works out for him, till it just turned out bad. The movie is directed by Peyton Reed, who did Break Up 2006 with Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Anniston.But as I said in the beginning it became a drag. The movie was a financial success though making over $220 million dollars in the box office compared to its $ 70 million budget.",5,1,2,8 September 2012
Ocean's Twelve," Not so great...
","Oceans Twelve is not half bad but not that great either, but by the time you get to the end of the movie you feel so angry and bad as you have just come to realize that all the action and all the buildup that occurred in the middle was just a waste of your time.The movie added a twist that made it look like you the viewer should have just fast forwarded to the end of the movie to see what the movie was all about. The Ocean's crew again was at it again, but this time the Terry Benedict (Andy García) is in on their game as he locates all eleven members of Danny Ocean's (George Clooney) gang, and demanded that they return the $160 million they stole from his casinos plus $38 million interest.The Ocean's crew now short the money that they stole from Benedict, have to come up with another heist to be able to make up for the money that they stole from him. The movie is called Ocean's Twelve because of the inclusion of one more person to the crew, Julia Roberts joined in the gang, so as to be able to help make up the money for the crew.The Ocean's Eleven still remained the same from the first movie: 1. George Clooney as Danny Ocean 2. Bernie Mac as Frank Catton 3. Brad Pitt as Rusty Ryan 4. lliott Gould as Reuben Tishkoff 5. Casey Affleck as Virgil Malloy 6. Scott Caan as Turk Malloy 7. Eddie Jemison as Livingston Dell 8. Don Cheadle as Basher Tarr 9. Shaobo Qin as 'The Amazing' Yen 10. Carl Reiner as Saul Bloom 11. Matt Damon as Linus Caldwell And then 12. Julia Roberts as TessThe movie also has Julia Roberts as Tess playing herself in the movie, as part of the plot to get the money they needed back. The movie lacks the grace that made the first film a masterpiece and here the crew also get to go up against another thief called The Night Fox, who wants to prove to Ocean that he is the best thief that there is.The movie was a box office success, making 3 times its production cost.Ocean's Twelve is not that good, but the thing that gets me is that Ocean's Thirteen that was done 3 years after and it was magnificent, making both the first and the last the only ones in the trilogy worth seeing.www.lagsreviews.com",5,1,3,18 March 2013
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Did I enjoy this Stanley Kubrick film?
","Did I enjoy this Stanley Kubrick film? Yes. Is it excitingly funny not really, although it rated as one of funniest movies out there, I will say one thing, which is Kubrick, did a good job of making a mockery of the cold war crises that was looming at the time of this movie's release.Dr Strangelove, is as captivating as the name, especially when you say it in full Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, my favourite scenes in this movie were when the commander of the bomber Major T. J. Kong, was riding the nuclear missile and the other is where Peter Sellers as Group Captain Lionel Mandrake was begging for 50 cents and he had to ask someone to shoot a Coca-Cola vending machine.Peter Sellers was actually set to play four roles in the movie, but it was later reduced to three and Slim Pickens played Major T. J. Kong which was meant to be played by Sellers. So Sellers played: 1. Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (which was my favourite character of all) 2. President Merkin Muffley, the American President. 3. Dr. Strangelove, a wheelchair bound German nuclear war expert and former Nazi, who has a gloved right hand that is uncontrollable and whose heart is still Nazi.The movie plot is about a general that went rouge and decided to kick off the nuclear war. He arranged a strike on the Soviet Union, and then made sure that the call back code to end it would not be found.The US president and his cabinet tried all they could to get back all the 34 planes that were going out for the strike, but they could only reach 30 and the Soviet shutdown 3 but one was heading off towards the target and there was no means to call it back.The movie was set to be released around the time of the Kennedy assassination but was pushed back, because the producers felt the nation did not need to see a movie like that at that time, there was a pie fight scene that was cut, because the was a line that went 'Gentlemen! Our gallant young president has been struck down in his prime!'Dr Strangelove as i said is a lovable film, and it will keep you glued, but to me it is over hyped, so i can't fully say it is a most watch but maybe you should give it a try and give me a buzz about your thought.www.lagsreviews.com",6,1,4,17 November 2012
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A nice ending to a beautiful franchise
","Star Wars episode VI is just the icing on the cake, the Empire Strikes Back is a classic and George Lucas just adds to an already wonderful story, by giving us a happy ending that we did not expect. Here is where you get to enjoy the power of the force (i.e. when you are comparing this movie to its original two counter parts; A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back) as Luke Skywalker demonstrates true mastery of it, as he had become a Jedi Knight between the events of Empire Strikes Back and now and later after the death of Yoda he became the only Jedi Knight left in the entire cosmos. Episode VI's ending is one of the things that has made the Star Wars franchise a must watch and a must have.The final battle between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader was something we all looked forward to, with Luke now a Jedi Knight, that battle was fun as now he and Darth Vader (his father) were evenly matched. The twist ending in the movie's story arc is just something you will come to respect the writers for, as they lead you on a good versus evil mind battle.The CGI in this movie was one that took me much by surprise it was impressive, it looked so well ahead of its time, with the acting portrayal of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) was the best in the series so far this is my favorite imprint of him in my mind, 'Luke Skywalker Son of Anakin Skywalker and the last Jedi Knight.' After the events of the Empire Strike Back which led to the capture of Han Solo (Harrison Ford), after he was frozen in a block of carbonite; Luke and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) with the help of others formulate a plan to free Solo from the hands of the crime lord Jabba.After his freedom and escape from Jabba and his minions, the trio decided to take the fight to the Empire, as plans were in place to build another Death Star. This battle was the going to be the final battle between the resistant forces and the empires, with both having an ace up their sleeves.This battle is parallel though to the Sith Lord's intension to convert Luke over to the Dark Side, as he and Darth Vader waited patiently for him to come so that he too like his father in the Revenge of the Sith will face the test of joining the Dark Side.Return of the Jedi is the last in the first sequel and the last in the chronology, Episode VI is just a part of a must have when you go buying the Star Wars box set, which I believe every movie lover already have.The movie was actually meant to be titled the Revenge of the Jedi, but the name got changed later on. Talks are ongoing that Disney is set to release a new Star Wars, Episode VII (probably in 2015) and if possible a new trilogy, here is something I so look forward to.www.lagsreviews.com",7,0,1,13 February 2013
Alien," Alien, what a movie...
","The first Alien franchise I saw was resurrection in the 1997, and I always craved to see what led to it.In 1979, with the aid of great cinematography Ridley Scott directed the first Alien film, and I have to be honest after you get over the first 50 minutes, the movie had all it takes to make you quiver. You may not appreciate the graphics but I can tell you one thing, they pulled it off.Sigourney Weaver, I just have to say, what a classic actress she is, she made sure the facial expressions and the reactions were enough to make you the viewer just wish she quits already.I have to give this movie thumbs up for execution, nice story build up all leading to the inevitable, an Alien on board the ship.Ian Holm played Ash, which with the help of the editor, pulled off some classic film trick to convince you of his predicament.The scenes that had the alien, had to be done with lighting and camera work to convince you of the threat. In this present day this is done with acting and the alien present introduced later on. The actors do a lot of work in the area of performance to convince you that they are scared of what they cannot see, of what will be CG included in post production.But back then the cinematographer and the director had to find away to convince you that the figure you are seeing is threatening, what I have to say Ridley Scott did a fine job of.The plot is simple, a crew is sent on a science exploration in space, they pick up a signal and divert to see what it was (they didn't really want to but it was against their contract), only for one of the crew to get infected by an Alien, they bring him onboard to help him and all hell breaks loss.If you are a fan of seeing things done back in the day, try this for size. If you are not, they were ahead of their time with this one so you won't feel taken for a ride.All in all, what are you waiting for reading this to the end, go get it and watch.",8,0,2,6 April 2012
Horrible Bosses," Rachel go wild
","Horrible bosses, a movie with enough profanity and sexual dialogs, to fill a person's lifetime.We all love Rachel from Friends, now imagine the same innocent and lovable Rachel cursing and sexually harassing a man. The movie is definitely a post-hangover flick It felt like watching Hangover all over again (Not Hangover 2, the mistake). The movie packs enough laughs for the year.The casting at first didn't look promising but they managed keep you entertained, as the actors actually took their role seriously and did a good job.The movie tells the tale of three friends who work for horrible bosses, One of them Nick (Jason Bateman) works as a financial company underling for a male boss (Kevin Spacey) who promise to give him a promotion and makes him work harder to get it and then give the promotion to himself. Kevin Spacey again showed why he is a seasoned actor as he took the role and made a master piece out of it.Another Dale (Charlie Day) worked as a dental hygienist for a female boss (Jennifer Aniston) who constantly harasses him sexually, demanding sex and blackmailing to tell his fiancée that they had, had sex together. He was the only one who i believe and so those his friends that he didn't actually have a problem.The last guy Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) worked as a chemical company accountant, for actually a nice boss (Donald Sutherland) who dies and the company is handed over to his son (Colin Farrell) who wants to suck all the money out of the company and live large.The three friends decides they would like to kill their bosses and hire an assassin turn consultant (Jamie Foxx) who tells them the best way to get it done without them getting caught.The director went straight to the point as the movie starts we are introduced to the actors and their bosses and the movie starts. The screenplay was well arranged as we also get to see the bosses' personal lives and still be kept in focus as the movie doesn't lose track of its purpose. But the movie had it's bad side to the dialog was so sloppy that I wondered what happened, the writers didn't have a dictionary, it was like if they don't know what to write at any point they filled it with the F-word, which was dropped around a 120 times.The good thing about the movie is how the 3 lead actors blended together as the director allowed them to improvise as you will see in the end of the movie, as the actors were actually doing some of their own writing, making up lines as they go,, which worked as all three are good TV comedy actors, Jason Sudeikis from Saturday Night Live and Day, from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.The was a thing with Jennifer Aniston's hair as the producers wanted it natural and as you will see in the movie she wore a wig, the producer wanted to audience to recognize the character while Jennifer didn't want the audience to think it was Rachel saying all the swear words and odd remarks.It's a movie you will like to watch again and as I will.",Null,0,0,12 July 2011
Taxi Driver," here is a classic i wish a remake will never be done
","Whether you have seen Taxi Driver or not the catchphrase 'You talking' to me?' has become increasingly popular and In 2005, it was chosen as #10 on the American Film Institute's AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes.The scene has Bickle (Robert De Niro) look himself in the mirror and rehearses drawing a gun at someone saying, 'You talking' to me? You talking' to me? You talking' to me? Then who the hell else are you talking' to? You talking' to me? Well I'm the only one here. Who the f#@k do you think you're talking to?' Taxi Driver was a commercial success, and that can be based majorly on the good work done by Martin Scorsese the director. The movie's cinematography is also exceptional, from shots taking from the taxi to the one's of Bickle on the street, it was classic. Scorsese and his cinematographer, Michael Chapman, would fit themselves on the back seat floor and use available light to shoot.Paul Schrader wrote the movie script; he made Bickle a Vietnam veteran because trauma of the war blended perfectly with Bickle's paranoid psychosis.Taxi follows the story of Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) who works the nightshift, driving his cab throughout New York City. As a war veteran, Travis suffered some mental issues which made it difficult for him to sleep.He also had an inability to connect with anyone, not even with other cabbies also played against him, and when he became infatuated by a blondy, (Cybill Shepherd) he did all he could to maintain a relationship with her but blew it.He also developed a fatherly connection with a prostitute named Iris (Jodie Foster), and tried to save her from herself and her pimp.With all this happening Travis buys guns with the aim of cleaning the streets of New York.Jodie Foster was 13 when she starred in this movie, her experience as a child star actress paid off. De Niro was so good in this movie, it was obvious that his best days were way back then, you can't compare what he did in this movie to what he is doing now.The Movie had a classic ending that you may interpret to be Bickle's dying dream, but as it turned out Bickle changed from a villain to a hero and then from the way he acted in the last scene of the movie you can guess that he is probably going to break soon.I hope a remake of this movie will never be done.www.lagsreviews.com",8,0,0,12 October 2012
Life of Pi," CGI at its best
","The movie has a saying that if you hear the story of Pi you will believe in God, well I did listen and watch his story and I have to say the story is both mystical and as it was made out to be spiritual. The movie is intense, and it starts with a light comic introduction of the lead characters, as I haven't read the book, I was wondering if the movie was going to fall in the genre of an outrageous comedy, then it drifts ever so gently to dramatic scene where the protagonist Pi meets the Tiger Richard Parker. From then on the movie holds your gaze and it is just an exceptionally good drama.The power of the CGI used is so high up there I believe that Avatar (James Cameron) has been bitten when it comes to the use of 3D imagery to make all things look real, from the production set which was done in Taiwan where the crew built a tank that could hold 1.7 million gallons to shoot all the ocean scenes to the interaction between the animals and Pi, you will be taken off your sits.Ang Lee, was the man in the directors sit for this movie; Lee's famous movies Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) and his Academy award win for best director movie Brokeback Mountain (2005) gave him the edge and knowhow he needed to make this another Academy Award movie, with Life of Pi getting eleven Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and Best Director.Based on a fantasy adventure novel by Yann Martel which was published in 2001, the movie and book plot was about Piscine Molitor 'Pi' Patel, an Indian boy who got involved in spirituality and scientific reasoning from an early age. His father decided to move the family to Canada, and sell off his Zoo animals, but on their way on a Japanese freighter tragedy struck and Pi is shipwrecked and stranded on a life boat in the Pacific Ocean alone with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.The movie/book is about how Pi survived 227 days stranded on a boat, and how he managed to take care of himself and the Tiger onboard.Life of Pi is as I have said before, a great movie that all should get the chance to see and enjoy. I see this movie winning Best Visual Effects at the Oscars, and probably more. So, when next you are at the cinemas thinking what to watch and this movie is still running, watch this, or better still wait and get the DVD.www.lagsreviews.com",8,1,3,15 January 2013
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Boring
","The only thing I enjoyed in this Episode II was seeing Yoda take on Count Dooku other than that, Episode II was boring to me, I even found myself preferring the more lackluster script and plot of episode I to this. I think mostly it is because of the wonderful performance of Liam Neeson in episode one that made me prefer it to this movie, because here in this episode II all that is available for me to see is, the Dark Lord getting more grips on the senate and Anakin getting closer to Padme.Due to the negative reviews that Episode I got, Lucas worked and re-worked on the script of this movie so as to present a more better star wars movie that all will like, the annoying Jar Jar Binks was sidelined in this movie giving fewer lines, as he only spoke like 3 times I think. The most cinematic experience in this new trilogy is the battle between CGI Yoda and 78 year old (that was his age at the time of the movie shooting) Christopher Lee. It was from there you will come to respect Yoda as others do.The movie takes off 10 years after the end of episode I, with some planets threatening to break away from the republic. Former queen of Naboo and now senator, Padme was sent to the senate by the new queen of Naboo. On her way to the senate an assassination attempt was made on her life. Young Anakin Skywalker and his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi were assigned to protect her with Anakin to watch over her and Obi-Wan to investigate who was behind the assassination attempt.During their duty Anakin and Padme became close and Obi-Wan stumbled on a larger plot tend to bring about a civil war.The movie had an overlong story, the dialogue was boring and since I'm watching it at the comfort of my home, I had to pause and walk off sleep. The acting was horrible I just couldn't believe it; Hayden Christensen who plays Anakin Skywalker Obi-Wan's gifted padawan apprentice, his performance was sad and dull I couldn't wait for his screen time to be over each time, his romantic link with Padme is just stupid, she just fell in love like that...?? it was outrageous.I disliked Attack of the Clones and really preferred the first. The movie did make its money but didn't make as much as the first movie and also didn't make as much as the last, in this second Trilogy of the Star Wars saga. Again I didn't like this movie for anything.www.lagsreviews.com",5,1,3,2 February 2013
Forrest Gump," Forest Gump
","'Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.' – Forest Gump.Forest Gump is not just a movie it is art, which bounces around in comedy, romance and drama. The naïve life of an individual who touches lives and influences his nation as a whole. Robert Zemeckis balances this movie in such a way that when you think you are getting swayed in the comic area he moves to romance, the moment you start to smile at blind love, he switches to drama/intrigue which captivates you.This movie has everything for everybody and its delivery is such that you remember the movie more for the adventures of Gump than his effects on America's history. Many Visual effects were used in the movie to incorporate Gump with historical American footages, like when he met President Kennedy.The movie is based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Winston Groom. The book and the movie do have some similarities and differences, the movie itself is based on the first 11 chapters of the book then skips to the end, some of the other occupations that Gump was involved in were omitted. Some parts that were not in the book were also added like his need for leg braces, also his autistic level in the book is more than what we see in the movie.The film is about an overly naive autistic man, named Forest Gump (Tom Hanks), whose life between his birth and the time he found out about his son Forest Jr. ran through American history, touching lives and influencing others.The most interesting thing to me is that Forest Gump was the man responsible for revealing the Water Gate scandal during Nixon's regime (this is bogus mind you).Winning six out of the thirteen Academy Award nominations, among the six awards, Forest Gump won Best Picture, Best Actor (Tom Hanks) and Best Director (Robert Zemeckis), the movie also won Three Golden Globe awards for Best Drama Picture, Best Actor (Hanks) and Best Director (Zemeckis)Forest Gump was a financial success, recouping more than 10 times is 55 million production cost, this movie has stood the test of time as a classic that all should have in the shelves. It is also recognized by the American film Institute, The film ranks 37th on their 100 Years...100 Cheers and 76th on their 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition). www.lagsreviews.com",8,2,3,20 December 2012
"Monsters, Inc."," i cant count how many times i have watched this flick
","Nothing warms me more for laughs than anytime I get to sit down and watch Monster's Inc. This is one Pixar animation that I hold dear to heart, I loved it so much that I didn't desire for them to make a sequel, because I felt they will wreck what is already a masterpiece. This is the best voice casting I have seen in any animation, the story of Monster's Inc. is just warm to the heart, as we follow the adventures of a little girl in the monster world. You just can't forget the voices of the top scarer James P. Sullivan aka Sulley (voiced by John Goodman) and his one-eyed assistant, Mike Wazowski (voiced by Billy Crystal).The idea for the Monster's Inc. story was born during a lunch in 1994 between Pixars production team of John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft during the production of Toy Story (1995). Pete Docter thought it up, and after they were done working on Toy Story, he stepped aside to build the story, while others were working on other Disney/Pixar animations. When he was done with the first draft (which was far different from the final film) the name Monster's Inc was pitched in by longtime Disney animator Joe Grant (who worked on the 1937 Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs).The movie plot underwent numerous changes over its writing and production years between 1996 and 2000. Its final story is about how monsters scare human kids to get their screams. The screams are then stored, refined and used as power, power in the sense of electrical power and fuel power. The flip side of this is that monsters are afraid of human kids, because they are believed to be toxic and one touch from a human child can kill them. There is a company in charge of this scream collection and refinement in Monstroplolis, that company is Monster's Inc. There in Monster's Inc our lead Characters are Sulley and Mike, Sulley is the top sacrer and Mike is his assistant.One faithful working day, the lives of both Sulley and Mike would change and the faith of the monster world also, as Sulley meet a human child (Boo) in their scare floor in the Monster's Inc factory, panic broke loose and Sulley not knowing what to do and how to contain the problem allowed it to escalate to the point that all Monstroplois is aware of the existence of a human child in the monster world and the whole monster world is in a state of panic.Monsters, Inc. won the Academy Award for Best Original Song and it lost the Best animated feature award to Dreamworks Shrek. It was a financial success and it received high positive reviews and it is a must watch.A sequel to this wonderful movie is set to be released 12 years after the first, in 2013, and it will be a prequel to the original plot.www.lagsreviews.com",8,0,1,27 December 2012
21 Jump Street," I have to be honest, I never expected to like this movie, but boy was it good.
","Buddy cop movies have been losing their waves. The thing is that all the buddy cop movies after Rush Hour 1 have been either too dull to comprehend or just mildly interesting and could just pass as a movie you've seen just to mark the register that you've seen it.Based on a TV series of the same name which aired on Fox Network between 1987 and 1991, the series focuses on a squad of youthful-looking undercover police officers investigating crimes in high schools, colleges, and other teenage venues. The 2012 movie adaptation also had the former cast of the series; Johnny Depp and Peter DeLuise play a minor role.Written by Jonah Hill who also starred in it, 21 is a movie that suits a cinema viewing with a box of popcorn at your side. Hill's performance was on a mild okay side, but the main cheese in the movie was Channing Tatum, who transcended from a jock to a nerd and still maintained his persona. I guess the most fun I had was when I saw Ice – Cube talking to the duo.The movie was directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs). The directors and writers made sure you didn't have to go see the original to get the full taste of 21, as the film made do of the current pop culture in our time and how ironic and dumb it looks to make a fun movie and enough juice left to make another.21 makes fun of everything in its path, even down to drugs, and how we kept expecting things to blow up and they just don't. The jokes keeps coming in from every corner making you laugh although.The high moments in the movie was whenever the duo were together, the low moment was when they were apart.The plot had the duo Hill and Tatum as Morton Schmidt and Greg Jenko (respectively), get deployed as undercover cops to a high school to bust a drug ring, and everything you'd expect to happen, doesn't. That's the fun of the movie.All in all, why are you wasting time reading this go watch it.",7,125,186,25 March 2012
The Godfather: Part II," Michael Corleone rise to Don Corleone
","The Godfather Part II stands among and will be seen as one of the best sequels out there thanks to the wonderful pairing of two fine actors with Al Pacino as Michael Coeleone, putting up such masterful display of acting that makes you want to hail him from the screen as 'The Godfather' and the other actor that was exceptional was Robert De Niro who played young Vito Corleone. The movie casting is one that will remain in the mind of film watchers for a long time.The film depicts the different paths in which the Corleone family took, as Vito took the high road of peace during his regime; Michael took the path of violence and taking all his enemies out the moment they show their face, to the point that no matter whom there were, friend or family you cross Michael you are dead.Partially based on Mario Puzo's 1969 novel, The Godfather, this 1974 sequel is in part both a sequel and a prequel to The Godfather movie released in 1972. The movie features two parallel dramas, one focusing on Michael Corleone's reign and him trying to gain control of the family business, the other story is based on flash backs of how Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro), rose from his childhood in Sicily Italy in 1901 to his coming to America and the founding of the Corleone family.The plot shows how Michael was looking into expanding his family business to Las Vegas and Cuba. During the process, an attempt on his life was made, and the person behind it was someone close to him, this led to Michael taking out more people. Michael's ruthless behaviour affected his family and trusted friends.Being the first film to have part II in its name, The Godfather part II was a box office success and it received critical acclaim as one of the best films ever made. The production had some production problems initially when Pacino not wanting to be part of it because he felt the script wasn't OK enough, so Coppola had to re-write it, before Pacino came on board.The American Film Institute's 10th anniversary of greatest films has the movie rated number 32, and its ranked 3rd in IMDb's Top 100 Movies of all time, with its predecessor The Godfather ranked 2nd. It also got 11 Academy Awards nominations and it won Best Picture for that year. Out of the 11 nominations it won six Oscars which included Best Director for Francis Ford Coppola, Best Supporting Actor for Robert De Niro and Best Adapted Screenplay for Coppola and Puzo.Al Pacino got a nomination for Best Actor but didn't win although in the BAFTA Award he won the Best Actor award for the film.The Godfather part II is a classic sequel to one of the best films ever made, so there is no need to see the first if you are not planning of crowning it with the second.www.lagsreviews.com",9,0,2,25 November 2012
Fargo," If anything can go wrong, it will...
","Fargo is a movie that depicts the Murphy's Law in total 'If anything can go wrong, it will...' Well in this movie it all went wrong.The movie states this is a true story, but that can be argued since the movie itself is completely fictional. The Coen brothers claim that many of the events that took place in the movie were actually based on true events from other cases that they threw together to make one story.The movie's radical turn of events is something that will catch the interest of any audience, as things just don't go as they should for anybody. The film earned seven Academy Award nominations, winning two for Best Original Screenplay for the Coens and Best Actress in a Leading Role for McDormand. It also won the BAFTA Award and the Award for Best Director for Joel Coen at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival. The movie plots have Frances McDormand starring as Marge Gunderson, a pregnant police chief with a sharp and smart mind, who begins piecing together a case where a pair of motorists are found slain not far from the corpse of a state trooper.As Marge continues to put it all together, more people seem to be involved in the case than there should.On the other side of the events we have Jerry (William H. Macy) who has had his wife kidnapped so he can get the ransom money but everything just goes wrong.Kudos to the Coen brothers for a nice screenplay as everything that seems to happen on each shot complements the next, the characters are well depicted and the acting is a strong A+. The movie did have its faults, there were scenes that were totally unnecessary and a lot of people may complement the accents but I found it meaningless.Editing was top notch, directing to me was not so bad but won't award it. The story too had its lapse it took too long to pick up.Coen brothers are no stranger to the Academy awards, their 2000 movie O Brother, Where Art Thou? Was also nominated (no wins), their 2007 movie No Country for Old Men won 4 Academy awards and their 2010 movie True Grit had 10 nominations (no wins).Fargo is a drama, if you are not a huge fan of dramas this could bore you, but if you don't mind, you will find it interesting to watch.www.lagsreviews.com",7,1,2,1 September 2012
Léon: The Professional," the ending of this movie is one to love
","This is Natalie Portman's first feature film, her acting and professionalism showed she was a natural and you will not be able to tell. Leon the professional is an intense action/violence film that involves two souls that differ in age and view of life. It delivers an exciting screenplay, wonderful performance by both leads and the eventual climatic ending. Even though it seem mostly likely the movie will end the way it did, the way Luc Besson pulled it off was eventful enough for you to respect Leon (the hit man) as truly a professional.Luc Besson is the man behind the movies Taken (2008) and Taken 2 (2012), and this movie is an extension of a movie that he did in 1990 titled Nikita which also starred Jean Reno.Leon the professional was done in 1994 and directed by Luc Besson and it was met with favorable reviews, although disturbing as it may seeing a young child like Portman in such a situation as her character found herself.The movie plot is about a hit man named Leon (Jean Reno), who didn't know how to read or write but what he knew he knew well he was a killer and the best at it.Leon's path crossed with one little girl who lived in an apartment some rooms from his, he took a caring into her and tried to help her when he can. Her name is Matilda (Natalie Portman) who living with her father, brother, step mom and step sister.Matilda is always getting a regular biting from her father which made Leon take pity on her, she saw this pity as love and the little 12 year old decided to run an errand for Leon, when she gets back her whole family has been murdered and the killers were still about.Here is my favorite scene in the movie, when Matilda sees her family dead she walks past the men with the guns, didn't start screaming goes to Leon's door, her back turned to the gun men and pressed the bell, praying hard that Leon will just let her in, the moment Leon opened the door, his life changed forever.Another thing to look out for is Gary Oldman, his performance in this movie is worth talking about as it was one worth his pay.This tragic thriller, revolves around a love between two people not meant for each other, their involvement with each other brought death to the life of many.Leon is a nice film, something that you will enjoy, no pedophilia is in this movie mind you, so fear not and go see it.www.lagsreviews.com",8,0,1,16 November 2012
Oblivion," It is just there
","The movie is more of a sight to see than a riddle job for the inquisitive mind, packed with enough twist and turns that puts you the viewer on a guess frenzy, Oblivion leaves you wondering where the threat is really coming from and whom to trust.With a beautiful sight for sore eyes setting, Oblivion's wonderful scenery and bubble craft will make you sit down and enjoy more of what is happening on the screen, than what the story is trying to pass across. Tom Cruise seems to be in top form, in Jack Reacher (2012) he showed his acting prowess and dominated the film from start to finish, here too he displays the same prowess and even making Morgan Freeman more of a side show to what is happening in the uprising between Tom Cruise character Commander Jack Harper and the alien threat (where ever it was coming from).Oblivion is based on an unpublished graphic novel of the same name by the director and producer Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy 2011). Joseph was able to bring to life his idea and concept, thanks to the 120 million production backing of universal studios. Although I still stand that the movie is a sight to see, it lacks in the area of its story, and it is not that the concept was not nice nor grand the screenplay was just boring at times. Do note they were action scenes to liven the mood, but the length in which you have to wait till the movie truly picks up, maybe worth it for some viewers, and may not for others.The storyline is about what happens 60 years after the earth got attacked by aliens known as Scavs. It focuses on one of the few remaining survivors Commander Jack Harper who was on earth as a drone repairmen. While fulfilling his duty he discovers a crashed spacecraft with happens to contain things that bring to question everything he believed about the war. Soon later he got captured by the said aliens that were still on the earth and he uncovers a truth that rocked his world to his entire existence.In the end I liked the way the movie turned out, it ended in a poetic tone and Tom Cruise's performance may be the greatest thing this movie has to offer other than the beautiful set pieces. So if you are a fan of the Mission Impossible man, then you will sure have fun seeing him here, but my final take is Oblivion could have been better.www.lagsreviews.com",6,1,3,22 April 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," One of the best movies ever made
","What makes this one of the best movies ever made, is how Peter Jackson brought to life a book that has stood the test of time, many adaptations of the book have been done in films and also animations before this, but known possess the intense action, wonderful musical score, and cinematography at its best; nor does any have a masterful director in Peter Jackson that made the best of the actors and made the story blend so beautifully.This is the best adaptation of the book The Lord of The Rings and is mostly because of the scenery and the actors, the CGI used is intense and the locations used in the making of this movie will make you think you are watching J.R.R Tolkien's imaginations as he was writing the book. I think the best thing that stood out from this movie is the Score.Lord of the ring is about a quest of a Hobbit, and his faithful companions who were trying to save the world from rise of an evil lord named Sauron, whose power is stored in a ring, a ring with a mind of its own, which found its way into the hand of the Hobbit Frodo Baggins (Elijah Woods).The are many differences that can be seen between the book and the movie, from the merging of characters which made Arwen to be used more in the movie than she was in the book, to the exemption of some characters like Tom Bombadil and reduction of the role of others like Barliman Butterbur. But regardless of these, which were mainly done to make the movie short and make the story more precise, like the forging of Narsil, which in the book was forged at the fellowship, but in the movie it is done in the last part (Return of the King), making Aragon's rise to the throne more dramatic.The Fellowship of the Ring was a critical acclaim during its release and it was a box office hit, making over 8 times its production cost of 93 million dollars. It also won four of the thirteen Oscar nominations it got, the four were for Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Makeup, and Best Original Score.This is considered the best out of the trilogy, and it can be found on AFI's 100 movies100 years (10th edition) on number 50.Peter Jackson brought life into this movie adaptation of J.R.R Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, the fight scenes were extraordinary, the dialogue are one to remember and the cinematography of this movie, is just exceptional, from powerful area views to shots that make you AWE at the magnificence of creation this is a movie for all to own on DVD.www.lagsreviews.com",9,0,1,5 January 2013
The Matrix Revolutions," just as low down as the second
","The Matrix Revolutions is suppose to the climax of this franchise, but in the end it ended up being the worse of the three, the movie actually brought the whole Matrix to an end, but in an anti climax kind of way.The movie said to have cost close to the same as the second, The Matrix Reloaded but due to (my opinion) the lost of interest due to the fact that the second kind of takes you to a place where you have more questions than answers, you are left wondering what is the whole point, which could be the reason why this last one made like same as the first but like half of the second.Also out of the three this had the lowest review rating. The movie draws you (well the second movie) to a point and tells you that all this has happened 5 times before now, so there is a possibility that things might not change and the matrix will reset and the war will continue, but this 6th reboot of the matrix is supposed to be different because in this new matrix love is involved. Neo's (Keanu Reeves) love for Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) is supposed to be the difference between 'The One' in this sixth matrix reboot and the others and the oracle believes that is all it will take.The movie focuses more on change and the ability to trust yourself more than what is going on around you. In the end of the second we saw that Neo's power extends beyond the matrix into the real world. In the end of The Matrix Reloaded Neo fell into a coma because he used his power too soon in the real world and he got stuck in a place between the matrix and the real world.The movie carries on for a long time keeping you at the edge of your sit, with Neo going up to face the source, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) has practically taking over the matrix and the machines are closing in on Zion so for a long time you are kept at the edge of your sit as you eagerly wait to see how it will all play out in the end.The visual effects here is not as captivating as it was in the second because it seems recycled, but there is one thing that is very captivating in the movie is the driving of Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith) although you know it is all visual effect and CGI but they made it very high tense.So at the end of the second and may not want to carry on (because I didn't), but I guess there is no point why not just finish it.www.lagsreviews.com",5,2,3,31 March 2013
Trouble with the Curve," Eastwood is not the director here
","'Now get out of here before I have a heart attack trying to kill you.' That is my favorite line from the 80 something Clint Eastwood in this movie Trouble with the Curve. The movie is sport drama, that is kind of predictable and it does drag, that you can actually get up, go to the toilet get back and still not have missed anything. This is Eastwood's first acting role since 2008's Gran Torino and his first acting role in a movie where he is not the director since 1993's In the Line of Fire. The great thing about this movie is Clint Eastwood; his years of acting and directing made it easy for him to flow with the other actors, and making him the principal person to look out for when you do decide to watch this flick.The movie plot is about an old retiring baseball scout Gus (Clint Eastwood) who is about to finish up his contract in 3 months, Gus eyes are failing him and his old time friend Pete (John Goodman) calls up his daughter Mickey (Amy Adams) to keep an eye on her father.Mickey who is very busy, had to break away from her demanding work to go be with Gus and together they go scouting where they met Johnny (Justin Timberlake) a former player that Gus scouted out.Not much of a big fan of Timberlake's acting, his performance in In Time (2012) is the best I have seen him in till date, here is just a supporting actor running around being a pest. The love story or romance perpetuated in this movie is too shallow, if this is how easy it is to fall in love, then I will tie myself to my wife everywhere she goes. (Note: there was no adulterous act in the movie)The movie's high point will be the locations, the movie was filmed in various locations giving it the rich feel like you are traveling with a scout, and it does pull up the question of man vs machine, which will triumph. In the other baseball based sport drama Moneyball (2012) which starred Brad Pitt, machine seems to be the victor; here man seems to be the victor, so I guess the fight continues.Trouble with the Curve, shows why scouts are always needed to help scout out talents, there can see things that your computer can, while the computer runs on statistics and calibration, the eyes and ears rely on fact and observation. Trouble with the Curve is an OK drama, but you have not missed much if you haven't seen it.www.lagsreviews.com",5,12,19,20 December 2012
North by Northwest," One classic mystery that you must see
","North by Northwest is an Alfred Hitchcock movie that is filled with twist and turns and counter twist that if you are not concentrating you will miss it all, it is known as one of his best mysteries.This classic 1959 American thriller film is directed by the mystery/thriller man himself Alfred Hitchcock. It was set to originally star James Stewart (Vertigo, Rear Window) as Thornhill, but as Hitchcock developed the script, he decided that Thornhill was more a Cary Grant type.The movie is based on a sixty page write up by a journalist named Guernsey. Hitchcock bought the write up for $ 10,000. He and Ernest Lehman worked on the script and Ernest Lehman further went ahead to develop the screenplay.What is so exceptional about this movie is that you never know what you will get or what's ahead; this movie will keep you guessing and wanting to see how it will end.The movie plot is centred on a man named George Kaplan. A certain Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant) was mistaken for George Kaplan, and for that he was almost killed and spent the night in jail.Things took a turn for the worse when Roger could not prove to the police that he was kidnapped, drugged and was about to be killed. It didn't get any better when he became a murder suspect, for stabbing a man in the UN.Now Roger must find a way to prove his innocence and save the woman he loves.This movie is known for its scenes which have become popular, one of which is the cropdusting scene, where a Naval Aircraft Factory N3N Canary chased Thornhill, that scene was named the best scene of all time in the August issue in 2009 of the British magazine Empire in their '1001 Greatest Movie Moments' of all time.The second popular scene is the shootout on Mount Rushmore at the end of the film which was filmed on a replica.The movie did introduce new trends, as fashion experts convened in the 2006 GQ rated the gray suit worn by Cary Grant throughout almost the entire film as the best suit in film history, and the most influential on men's style.The movie is ranked fourth in the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Thrills, behind Psycho (1960), Jaws (1975) and The exorcist (1973). North by Northwest was nominated for three Academy Awards, which were Film Editing, Art Direction and Original Screenplay (Ernest Lehman) but lost it all to Ben Hur.This is a nice mystery, true and true one you will enjoy.www.lagsreviews.com",8,0,1,2 November 2012
"I, Robot"," enjoyable
","I, Robot is a movie that I found that I loved much after watching it, the character Del's (Will Smith) obsession on trying to prove that robots can't be fully trusted and a lonely robot's ploy of trying to prove his innocence is what makes this movie captivating, with two different initially parallel stories meeting at the grand middle showcasing a wall of conspiracy to give you an explosive tale of a man and a robot against the forces.I, Robot is loosely based on Isaac Asimov's short stories also named I, Robot and picking up major plot elements from Isaac Asimov's 1953 novel, which is the first of the Robot Novel series named 'The caves of Steel'.I, Robot is a futuristic film about a time where robots have become an integral part of human existence. These Robots are governed by three major rules: First Law: A robot must never harm a human being or, through inaction, allow any harm to come to a human. Second Law: A robot must obey the orders given to them by human beings, except where such orders violate the First Law. Third Law: A robot must protect its own existence unless this violates the First or Second Laws.The future had a Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) who blames robots for the death of his daughter, as a robot chose to save his life instead of that of his daughter during a drowning incident. The robots choice was based on the calculation that there was a higher chance of survival by saving his life instead of his daughters. This incident made Del see the robots as a threat.His fears start to take form, when a robot was discovered who can operate outside the set rules and had the ability to act out emotions.The major difference between the movie and the novels will be the ending neither of the novels had an ending that showed a robot uprising nor a collection of robots trying to curb mankind's behavior.The movie is directed by the Alex Proyas who directed the 1994 critical and box office success movie The Crow which starred the late Brandon Lee (who died after being accidentally shot on set during the making of the film). Alex was also the mind behind the movie Dark City (1998) which has a massive cult following, and often used by some as a teaching material, but Dark City was a box office disappointment.I Robot was not much of a critical acclaim, as it did have its nay- sayers but in the global box office, it did make its money back. I liked I, Robot due to its Academy Award nominated Visual Effects (which it lost to Spideman 2, which is not a surprise) and the story arc between two individuals one human one robot who tries to stop a bunch of robots from taking over.www.lagsreviews.com",7,0,0,23 December 2012
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," i'll be back
","When a movie leaves an imprint phrase in the mind of all who watches it, just know a classic is born, 'Hasta la vista, baby' was the catch phrase that we all used way back in the 90s thanks to Arnolds Terminator.With intense chase scenes, and high end graphics Terminator 2 was setting a standard that all others had to meet. In other to differentiate the two terminators a lot of visual and computer effects had to be used. The first Terminator film was done in 1984 and fewer effects can be seen used to portray the Terminator character. Here in this 1991 sequel titled Judgement day more graphic effects had to be employed to portray the nature of the T-1000.The T-1000 is a mimetic poly-alloy (liquid metal) structure, who has the ability of shape shifting into another human or morph into almost anything it touches. Such visual effects led to the movie winning Best Visual Effect in the Academy Awards and British Academy Film Awards.Terminator 2 follows the story of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) who had an initial meeting with a Terminator who was sent back in time to kill her unborn son. Her son John Connor (Edward Furlong) who is now born and in his teen years, is also under a new threat a new, more advanced Terminator made of liquid metal and who is also a shape shifter a T-1000 Terminator (Robert Patrick) has been sent back in time to kill John and prevent him from becoming the leader of the human Resistance against the machines. To help Sarah and John an old, less advanced Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) which Sarah had to battle with is also sent back in time to help them.Cameron took the machine from the first movie, and made it to a machine with a purpose, the change from a villain to a hero is one that Schwarzenegger pulled off so well, making good use of his voice and his statue to pass the message that this T-101 is not someone you want to mess with.With a whooping 94 million dollar production, Terminator 2: Judgement Day made over 500 million dollars in its theatrical run, making it one of the highest grossing movies in the world, and it holds a 98% approval rating in Rotten Tomatoes.Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a classic Sci-Fi movie to own, watch and love. The perfection in the acting and the fun in the script made this movie one to place in the record books as one of the best movies of all time. www.lagsreviews.com",8,0,0,17 December 2012
Apocalypse Now," it is a classic among classics, best Vietnam war movie
","This will stand out as the best Vietnam films that there is, its explicit description of war and its vast effect on the mind of those who are engaged in it are well shown. The movie is exactly the meaning of the Neville Chamberlain quote 'In war, whichever side may call itself the victor, there are no winners, but all are losers.' Not a huge fan of war movies, but some just stand out Saving Private Ryan (1998) is one, and Apocalypse Now is another. The details in the movie, the progression from the point of kill to the execution and 'The Horror the horror' the horror of war, mass killing and the genocide are so well depicted in this movie. Kudos has to go to Francis Ford Coppola who produced and directed this movie.Boasting of excellent cinematography, as you watch you just have to appreciate the great camera views the movie depletes, the light effects are so well done to make sure you get the feel of being in a jungle.Apocalypse Now is a 1979 epic war film set during the Vietnam War, its story revolves around two characters U.S. Army special operations officer Captain Benjamin L. Willard (Martin Sheen) and U.S. Army Special Forces Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando).Willard was sent on a special mission to kill Kurtz, who is believed to be insane. The movie is about the journey from where Willard is seen going to the psychological effects of war, to where he was called and sent on the mission. His mission led him to meet more soldiers each having a different mechanism of coping with the war.Willard's journey led him to Kurtz who is worshipped by the locals and he sits high as a king among them.The movie production went on for over 3 years with Coppola thinking he will never finish the movie, with Typhoon Olga ruining the set at one time, the theft of the entire payroll, Marlon Brando showing up over weight the movie looked like something that was not forth coming but Coppola pulled it off in the end making a masterpiece that will be talked about for years to come If you are not a fan of animal cruelty the movie's ending is not for you, even I that I can't seem to care less about animal cruelty was moved by the ritual of the local Ifugao tribe, the ritual involves the butchering of a water buffalo in such a cruel manner.The last words of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) is one that has been used popularly in the cinematic universe 'The Horror. the horror.' Apocalypse Now stands head above shoulders over any Vietnamese war movie out there, it is a classic among classics and it won Golden Globe Awards for Best Motion Picture – Drama and Best Director for Coppola. It is also won Academy Awards for Best Cinematography and Sound.In the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) it is rated number 30.

Silver Linings Playbook," You will love every moment of watching this film
","I want to advise all, don't make the same mistake I did, I felt this film was just a romantic waste of celluloid and my precious time so I stayed away from it, till I heard about its Oscar nominations. This is one of the best movie I have seen this decade, the acting is so great that I was so surprised; I have seen many Bradley Cooper movies, mind me list some The Midnight Meat Train, Yes Man, He's Just Not That Into You, The Hangover, Valentine's Day, A-Team, Limitless and Hangover II. All of this especially Limitless (2011) shows how good an actor Cooper is, but this movie shows how great an actor he truly is.Silver Linings Playbook is such a great movie, well written and well directed. The Weinstein Company bought the rights to the book (The Silver Linings Playbook by Matthew Quick) before it was even published, a decision I'm sure the company will never regret because not only is this movie a must watch, so you can see wonderful acting from Bradley, Jennifer Lawrence (Hunger Games (2012) and X-Men: First Class (2011)) and Robert De Niro it is a must have. It is well paced and I liked the score and the dance scenes.The movie plot is about Pat (Bradley Cooper) who has bipolar disorder, which developed when he found his wife cheating on him and he nearly beat the man to death. The movie kicks off when Pat got released from the mental institution and move back in with his parents. He then met Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who was just as messed up as he was. The two together developed a relationship that helped keep them mentally stable.But Pat is still hooked on getting back with his wife Nikki and Pat's father (Robert De Niro) is so determined to get his juju working by bonding with his son so that the Philadelphia Eagles could win, since Pat Sr. is placing all his money on the Eagles winning.The movie is well directed by David O. Russell (The Fighter (2010)) the screenplay is well crafted to sooth the viewer to feel the intimacy developing between the leads. Silver Linings Playbook was shot on a 33 day period and it got eight Academy Award Nominations including the Big Five the first time since Million Dollar Baby in 2004, (the Big Five are: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and screenplay — either Best Adapted Screenplay or Best Original Screenplay, which has been won by only three movies It Happened One Night (1934), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and The Silence of the Lambs (1991).). Silver Lining Playbook was a commercial box office success making over 7 times its production cost and it is also a critical acclaim.Here is a movie you have to see no matter what, even if you have to cut corners being down stumbling blocks, just make sure you see this.www.lagsreviews.com",8,0,0,20 February 2013
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Just a whole lot of pointless action
","The movie starts promising and ends disappointing. The movie is meant to be a cross between action, horror and comedy but forget the last two (horror and comedy) because the jokes are just flying over your head and the horror scenes will make you yawn. My main problem with the movie is the cursing (which were few, mind you), before any of the lead characters uses the f-word, there was a pause and the camera focuses on the face and the f-word will be given a grand entrance, as if the word is holy. My final take is that this movie is just a saddle stick for a sequel and it is just borderline crap.The summary of the plot which adds a new spin to the fairy tale has Hansel & Gretel (Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton respectively) as bounty hunters who track and kill witches all over the place. At a town children are being taken by witches, and the duo is called to investigate. They came across a plot by the witches, a plot which involves the Blood Moon and the siblings face an evil that holds the secret to their past.The movie is written and directed by Tommy Wirkola (a Norwegian) who makes a living making action horror flicks and this crap-piece is his first big budget film, he is noted to have said that he was surprised (and so am I) that the big Hollywood studios went for the movie calling his script a 'rock n' roll script'. The script is rock n' roll alright rolling down to the gutter with a script that made me want to puke, bad continuity from one scene to the other it is just topsy-turvy, with nothing going straight. It seems like you the viewer is left wondering why some things are happening, and forget the twist, the movie is predictable.I have seen better movies in my life and if this was a B-movie it would have been best, I can't imagine the cost the CGI must have taken from the huge 50 million budget of this movie. The CGI and stunts are cool but everything else will make you want to smash the screen.What I advice any movie watcher to do is to not bother seeing this movie, try and watch something else, there is no surprises, no wow moment, no story depth nothing. just a bunch of guys running around feeling cool killing witches.The sad thing I have to say is that, bad guys narrating their entire evil plot to the hero instead of just killing them straight away, is kind of an out dated practice, so I was surprise to see it here. Please don't watch this.www.lagsreviews.com",4,3,8,2 February 2013
Face_Off," One of my favorite action film
","There is no better action film out there than the one that this duo (Travolta and Cage) dug up in Face/Off, with heavy budget being put down for the intense action scenes depicted in this movie, director John Woo won the Saturn Awards for Best Directing as he leads us down a path where we discover the repercussion of a life without forgiveness.The movie's high point is the speedboat chase towards the ending of the film, the scene got a MTV Movie Awards for Best Action Scene and the movie duo won Best Duo (in the MTV Movie Awards) for Travolta and Cage.The movie tries to show the effects of personal feuds and how if not well contained can ruin lives of those we love and nothing sets off to show us this lesson than this classic that has its tales drawn from Greek mythological feud between Hector and Achilles. The names Castor and Pollux also come from a pair of brothers in Greek mythology. The wonderful face off scene at the end between the two leads that had doves flying around is similar to Woo's classic 1989 Hong Kong film The Killer.The movie plot is about Sean Archer (John Travolta) an FBI Agent who has been chasing down a criminal crime Lord Castor Troy (Nicholas Cage) for years. Their feud led to the death of Archer's son Michael and Archer strongly believes that his son's killer is his sworn enemy Castor Troy. Archer finally cornered Castor one day and a fight broke out and Troy got knocked out cold. But Archer later finds out that Troy has planted a bomb somewhere in Los Angeles and the only other person who knows the bomb location is Castor's brother Pollux, who refuses to talk. To get Pollux to talk a special operation doctor provided a solution that will require cutting off the face of Troy and placing it on Archer, Archer undergoes the surgery with the knowledge of limited people, so as to keep the operation hidden and takes the face of Troy to go undercover. But things go wrong when Castor Troy somehow regains consciousness and now wants revenge on Archer for taking his face and the first thing Troy does is to kill everybody who knows about the operation.Face/Off was highly hyped before its release which happened to be same year that Titanic (1997) was released, Face/Off lived up to the hype, making you the audience wanting to watch the film over and over again because one ride is not enough; It was also a commercial success making thrice its worth in the box office. Face/Off Holds a 94 percent 'Fresh' rating on Rotten Tomatoes the only thing that separates this movie from old time classics like Mad Max is the intense use of action set pieces.The acting by this two is one I will not forget soon, when watching the movie on its release I wanted to be an action hero like one of them. Face/Off to me is a classic and one of the best action films I have seen till date.www.lagsreviews.com",8,1,2,17 December 2012
Collateral," Here is a movie i will always remember
","Collateral is one movie I will always remember watching.Collateral is a beautiful thriller and Jamie Foxx's portrayal of his character is welcoming and it gained him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Collateral is a crime thriller film from one of the best directors around Michael Mann and his directorial ace is how he paced the movie, not to mention the packaging and the way the plot unfolds is just magical. Cruise did very well in his portrayal of a villain he was so well composed and the way he spoke will pass the message across that this individual is ready to do anything to get the job done.Collateral has a hired assassin going on a ride with a taxi driver names Max (Jamie Foxx), all in the aim of making some stops and taking out some individuals that he was paid to do so. Max on the other hand had no idea that the passenger he was so eager to carry was one he never forget. Vincent (Tom Cruise) was the name of the passenger and he was ready to pay Max six hundred dollars to take him to some places.Now Max has been a Cabby for 12 years and $ 600 in one night just from one person looked like a nice deal, so he took it and not long things started to change and Max latter regretted the decision. He also had to stand up to Vincent which took some guts, and in the end we learn, if it sounds too good to be true ($ 600 for a night for some stops), probably it is.Collateral approaches you from a view of the hired assassins, and it solidifies the thought we have of them, heartless psychopaths with no morals at all. When you view the movie's build up to the eventual fallout of the relationship of the assassin and his unwilling apprentice, you just have to marvel on the way the story just kept flowing without send you to sleepyville. Perpetuation is one thing that this movie has, although it doesn't get tiring you will notice it. This nice thriller did have some cinematography flops especially when there are trying to achieve a close up, it looked amateur, which was the idea mind you, but it was not cool.The whole idea of a bad guy all up in suit and with white hair was just cool, as in Cruise looked cool in his portrayal. Collateral is one movie I will always remember watching and if you haven't seen it, I'm wondering why.www.lagsreviews.com",7,0,0,7 May 2013
Dark City," starts slow then picks up
","Dark City does have a grand ending but the buildup is what causes many to feel this movie is just not that good, cause after a while of waiting wanting to see what these 'Strangers' were up to, there was a point when I just got tired of wanting to see what they were up to and longed for the end of the movie but when I got close to end I found myself sitting up being drawn back into the movie and wanting to see what will happen next.Directed by Alex Proyas (The Crow (1994) and I, Robot (2004)) Dark City is his next film after the Crow which saw the end to the life of Brandon Lee, who died on set in the final filming of the 1994 movie (The Crow).The movie plot is about John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell), who woke up in a bath tub with no idea of who he is (amnesia) but to make it worse he finds a dead girl in his room, then he finds himself on the run from the police as he is being sort for, for murder.While running from the cops, Murdoch attempts to discover who he is and clear his name, when a mysterious group known only as the 'Strangers' who have psychokinetic ability, were also seeking him to kill.There was fear that many wouldn't understand the movie, due to the very complexity of what goes on, as you the audience are left to determine what is real and what is not, but that is the point of the movie and it added to the flare and the narrative style of the movie, which is good enough to keep you concentrating not lost. Proyas determination to make a horror thriller is what makes the movie dark, but the horror intention of Proyas is missed, as the movie is more thrilling than it is horror. The writing of the movie was done by Proyas, Lem Dobbs and David S. Goyer, Goyer who wrote the sequel to Proyas 1994 cult movie The Crow. Proyas initially wrote the movie to focus on the detective Frank Bumstead (William Hurt), but as the movie script was being developed the main plot changed from the detective to the man being chased by the detective, John Murdoch.Dark City was filmed entirely on set, with no location used, with Proyas using the same production designer from his previous film The Crow. This entirely built set showcases excellent cinematography, as we travel between what we know as city and the lair of the Strangers.Dark City is a cult classic movie, and it has grown thanks to Roger Ebert (a popular and notable movie reviewer) and home screenings. Dark City has come to stay, holding a nice rating in many review sites, although the movie was not much of a box office success in 1998, it is still a well talk about movie, one that you can only enjoy if you hang on to the end.www.lagsreviews.com",6,0,2,25 December 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Well...not so great but still go see it
","Not so amazing but as you get over the first 30 minutes bore of, 'I have seen this before' you get sucked in to the fun and the bumpy drive of Spidy getting started.The movie to me is more of a money making franchise and a keep the character right scheme than a plan to entertain. But if I look at what is being dished out this year some movies have been more on a making money agenda than entertaining.Sony debunked the Spider-Man 4 idea, maybe because of cast or could it be because the story will cost too much to be made. The trio of Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and Sam Raimi (as director) has been replaced with Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone and Marc Webb (as director). Now Emma Stone plays Gwen Stacy in this flick and I figured we got an intro to our new Mary J. Watson.Sony decided to reboot the Spidy series with Garfield as Peter Parker / Spiderman. The movie goes back a little as we get to see Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) and with Connors comes the 'The Lizard' something I was eager to see and I have to give credit to the CGI as the Lizard had a lot of close ups and still looked good.A little change in things concerning the web slinger and some more addition in story that was never there before, that is why the 30 minutes intro will make you feel, 'what the heck!' Another thing I have to give credit to the director for is the well-choreographed introduction to the web slinger's powers. He discovered his power in a train that led to a series of accidents that saw him beat guys up, and kept apologizing each time.Unlike the conventional shy and laid back Parker of Maguire, Garfield's Parker is a little sly and dark and wears a hood as much times as possible.He is left behind by his parents and his father could be alive, as Dr. Connors somehow knew him.Conventionally we know the story; Peter leaves with Uncle Ben and Aunt May, he gets beaten by a radioactive spider and voila! But here Peter actually disobeys rules and sneaks into the lab where he got beaten, and after Ben was gone we get to see a dark Parker walking around in a hood.Then when the director got bored I guess he throws down the hood, puts aside the revenge persona and changed into a hero.And as usual Dr Connors was trying to grow back his hand which led to 'The Lizard', he then decides to turn the whole city into creatures like him and then he was stopped by our hero.Was Marc Webb better than Raimi as the director? Well wouldn't say so because Webb had to make me like what I have seen before, and in a way he did.Was Garfield better that Maguire? That I will live for you to point out yourself and you can then tell me what you think.But the movie is not a total waste, but it is an obvious unnecessary but I still say go see it.",6,0,3,10 July 2012
Aliens," Go See this
","How often is a sequel better than the previous part?Happening after Ellen Ripley woke up after 57 years in Hyper Sleep, Aliens a sequel to Alien (1979 directed by Ridley Scott) and was directed by James Cameron, who had just finished working on The Terminator at the time and was interested in doing a sequel to the Alien. He wrote a 45 page story and presented it to Fox and he was giving a deadline and minimal budget of 18 million to meet a release date of 1986.After ten months of production, Cameron finally did it and met the production date after having to deal with issues with filming methods in England where the movie was filmed.Also the issue that Fox wanted to go ahead and do the movie without Sigourney Weaver, who wanted to be paid $ 1 million dollars for the role, in which she played 7 years before for 30 times less. After a lot of dispute Fox caved and paid her the sum, and Cameron adjusted to filming in England, the movie Alien II was made and was a commercial success and a wonderful movie.The difference between Alien and Aliens (Alien II) is the genre, while the former was more of horror with some action; Cameron opted for a more action movie (taking cue from The Terminator which was a success). The actions in the movie kicks off from the get go, after some introductions and setup towards the flight back to LV-426, the planet where Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and her crew first encountered the Alien eggs from the moment they land things started to happen.Ripley was called on as a consultant, to escort a crew of marines to LV-426 which was now home to a terraforming colony, a colony that has not been heard from for a while.As usual the same way Alien by Ridley Scott went so did this one, there was mayhem, there were killings, there was betrayal and of cause there was action far more action than the predecessor.Aliens is a film I recommend, and it is going to keep you glued to your sit. A lot more improvement was done to the graphics and the Aliens were given close range shots and we get to see them move, unlike the previous version where the Alien were being done using mainly camera work and lighting.This film had great cinematography done by Adrian Biddle, who did the cinematography for V for Vendetta (2006) and was also involved in the camera work in Alien.All in all, it is a movie to see.",9,1,3,6 April 2012
The Exorcist," this is a movie to see true and true
","I started watching this movie hoping to be scared off my wits, as it is casted in the light of one of the scariest movies out there, well I have lost my wits and this movie freaked the hell out of me.The Exorcist is a 1973 horror film and it is directed by William Friedkin (Rules of Engagement in 2000). The movie itself was adapted by William Peter Blatty (who won an Academy Award for his work) from a novel he wrote two years prior to the movie release, the novel also named The Exorcist was inspired by the 1949 exorcism case of Roland Doe.The movie plot is about an actress Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) who was visiting Washington, D.C. to shoot a movie, her 12-year-old daughter Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) started behaving strangely which made Chris send her to the hospital, later on her physical appearance started to change making Chris frightened and scared.Also there in Washington is a young priest who served in a University who was starting to lose faith while dealing with his mother's terminal sickness.With Chris at her wits end knowing not what to do, took advice given to her by some doctors and called a priest to perform an exorcism on her daughter.There is a scene in the movie where Chris steps into her house and the lights flicker and you see subliminal reflections, I actually tried to put on the light while viewing the scene by using the switch in my room before I remembered that was not going to help.It was nominated for 10 Academy Awards and winning two, Best Sound and Best Adapted Screenplay. The Exorcist is the first horror film to be nominated for Best Picture in the 46th Academy Awards and it lost it to The Sting. It became one of the highest earning movies of all time, grossing over $441 million worldwide.It was named the scariest film of all time by Entertainment Weekly and Movies.com, IGN's Top 25 Horror Movies of All-Time has it as the number one horror movie of all time and was No. 3 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments.The exorcist is a movie guarantee to scare and freak you out at the same time take the time out to check it out.(Note: This movie has disturbing scenes and blasphemy against God and Christ) www.lagsreviews.com",7,1,2,6 November 2012
Ocean's Eleven," One of the best heist film there is
","Ocean's Eleven is a remake of a Rat Pack 1960 movie of the same name that starred Frank Sinatra. This movie is just graceful, that is the word. It features one of the greatest ensemble cast that you can find and having them come together for one purpose and one purpose only to take down a casino. And the merging of these talents was well done by Steven Soderbergh, who was the director and cinematographer of the movie.Daniel Ocean and his crew made robbing a casino look easy, since all you need is some background cash and a crew of different people with unique skills. If you have these people in your back pocket then you, 'the robber' are game enough to take down anybody.Steven Soderbergh and Clooney came together with the aim of putting this film together and after the wonderful display of acting from all the cast, let's not forget Julia Robert and Andy Garcia were also in this movie, the movie was well received and led to a trilogy.The movie is about Danny Ocean (George Clooney), who just got out of jail and the first thing on his mind is to perform the perfect steal. After Danny got out he started to recruit the team members for his heist, they were:In order of recruitment: 1. George Clooney as Danny Ocean 2. Bernie Mac as Frank Catton 3. Brad Pitt as Rusty Ryan 4. lliott Gould as Reuben Tishkoff 5. Casey Affleck as Virgil Malloy 6. Scott Caan as Turk Malloy 7. Eddie Jemison as Livingston Dell 8. Don Cheadle as Basher Tarr 9. Shaobo Qin as 'The Amazing' Yen 10. Carl Reiner as Saul Bloom 11. Matt Damon as Linus CaldwellThe job looked impossible but Danny believed they could do it, so together they formed the master plan to take on the Bellagio, The Mirage, and the MGM Grand casinos, these casinos were owned by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia).There is also a catch to this heist; Danny's Ex-Wife (Julia Roberts) is now going out with Benedict.This movie was extremely popular and the movie grew from just a fun movie to watch, to having a huge fan base that led to the release of two other Ocean crew movies that also had the same cast from here and featured new popular cast. This movie cost nothing less than $85 million to make, due majorly to the cast, but it made its money back and over in the box office and it stands as the best of all the three in the franchise.My favorite take from the movie is that 50% of the time when Brad Pitt is on screen he is eating something.www.lagsreviews.com",7,0,2,18 March 2013
Spirited Away," Japenese Alice in Wonderland
","It is hard to find a cartoon that can please both those who love both anime and animations; this movie is one that does, the craftiness of the script, the whole new world and fantasy is all well glued together all you need is the imagination to be able to access this Japanese Alice in wonderland.Spirited Away is a critical acclaimed film and it finds its way to the top of many notable lists of greatest animated films of all time. During its release it was the highest grossing Japanese film ever and in the 75th Academy Awards it won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.This 2001 Japanese animated film is written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki who is a Japanese film director, animator, manga artist and screenwriter with a career that has spanned over fifty years, his films are often about humanity's relationship with nature or humanity and technology. The protagonists in his films are usually strong, independent girls or young women. His career in animation has led to many comparing him to Walt Disney.The movie plot starts with Ten-year-old Chihiro Ogino and her parents who were traveling to their new home when her father decides to take a short cut which got them lost.While they kept moving they strolled into another world where Chihiro lost both her parents and she was being hunted and disliked as she was the only human in the world she was in.Chihiro's journey led her to meet the twin grandmas, a dragon, a no face spirit that can eat anything in sight and she also met a giant baby who is afraid of germs. Now Chihiro most always remember her name so she would not forget she is a human and be able to tell her parents apart from the pigs all this with her trying to find her way back to her world.Spirited away is based on Miyazaki friend's ten year old daughter, he decided to make a movie for her and her friends who come for vacation in his cabin with his family.With the characters mostly hand drawn and a budget of $19 million dollars, Miyazaki and his production crew decided to keep the graphics simple so that the focus of the movie will not be diverted from the story.The English adaptation of the film was done by Walt Disney Pictures under the supervision of Pixar animator John Lasseter; also on the production crew was Beauty and the Beast (1991) co-director Kirk Wise who acted as the director in this English adaptation and Aladdin (1992) producer Donald W. Ernst who was also the producer in this flick.I still stand to say this is one of the best animations out there, the fantasy level is high and the twist and turns that it brings makes the whole movie very interesting and a nice movie to see with the family.www.lagsreviews.com",7,0,0,20 November 2012
The Usual Suspects," one of my favorite interrogations
","A movie whose name is gotten from a line in the old classic, Casablanca 'The Usual Suspect' is about an interrogation gone wrong. The movie is very hard to connect together, and the masterful twist ending for some did more harm than good, but for me it was the thriller of the whole movie. The fact that after the movie is over I still have to sit down and think about it, connecting the dots and wanting to have another re- run of the movie to be sure that I don't miss any dot, that is the reason why this movie is a master piece.Written by Christopher McQuarrie, the Keyser Söze character is based on the accounts of John List, an accountant who murdered his family in 1971 and then disappeared for almost 20 years by assuming a new identity before he was eventually apprehended in 1989. McQuarrie got the name Keyser Söze from the name of his former supervisor Keyser Sume, and the last name Söze is Turkish which is translated as 'talk too much.'The Interrogation scene was first shot and it ran for 6 days, and the rest of the movie was put together next and editing was the grand touch that made this mystery thriller that good a movie to see.The movie plot is about the interrogation of a small time con man named Roger 'Verbal' Kint (Kevin Spacey), who is a one of the only two survivors of a heist gone wrong that resulted to a fire on a ship. He tells the interrogator the series of events that led him and four other criminals to the boat.This series of events are shown to the viewer in the form of flashbacks as Kint narrates his story to the over confident interrogator. As the story goes on and gets complex the interrogator connects the dots and explains the story better to Kint, only to get the shocker of his life when he releases Kint believing he was used by the other four.Done with a 6 million dollar production budget, the movie recouped its production cost and more; the well crafted screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie gained him an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and Kevin Spacey won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as the criminal Keyser Söze.The Usual suspect is a fine film, well developed to push the imaginations of the viewer, the unexpected ending is the cream on the top of this delicious masterpiece and one thing is sure, you will be asking for seconds after you are done seeing it the first time. www.lagsreviews.com",8,4,6,20 December 2012
Die Hard 2," a nice follow up
","Die Hard 2: Die Harder starts with McClane going around with a smile, as he is looking forward to meeting up with his wife at the airport, then the movie picks up as we see the new villain and his crew start to take places as they plan to take over Washington Dulles International Airport. This movie kicks off well, it draws you in as you are eager to see what will be the outcome of all this bad guys taking position and then next we are drawn into a lone hero taking on a terrorist gang in a way that Jack Bauer (pardon me all you 24 (TV series) fans) would wish he had the guts to even try.In this second film in the franchise the action starts early brief introduction is done, and McClane starts to kill bad guys bringing one down in the first 15 minutes of the film. The movie did have its fault though, like the time when one of the bad guys stopped getting away to look back, so he could get killed and McClane could get a ride.Die hard 2 like its predecessor is adapted from a book named 58 Minutes that was released in 1987 and written by Walter Wager and the characters are from the Roderick Thorp bestselling novel Nothing Lasts Forever in 1979. This second movie had recurring cast from the first movie like McClane's wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), Dick Thomburg (William Altherton) and Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) who appeared briefly.The movie kicks off like the last on Christmas Eve, when terrorist took over the airport to break out their fellow terrorist off a plane with no hitches. Unfortunately for the terrorist McClane happened to be at the same airport and his wife was in the air with the planes running out of fuel; McClane has to take out the terrorist and find a way to land the planes.This movie has McClane our lone hero find himself in the same mess like the first, with almost similar environment; so like he went all carefree in the first and ending up all shut up and beat up in the end, so did he in this one.The movie's production cost was 3 times more than the first Die Hard in 1988, and made almost twice more, making this 1990 movie a commercial success and it was also well received by critics but not as much as the first which was a critical acclaim. After you have seen the excitement that the first Die Hard brings there is practically no reason why you should not dig this up too.After this movie 20th Century Fox waited 5 years before we saw McClane again going all 'Yippee kai yay, motherfu@#er' on the bad guys. The other movies in this franchise are Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995), Live Free or Die Hard (2007) and A Good Day to Die Hard (2013).www.lagsreviews.com",6,0,1,2 March 2013
Liar Liar," just there
","Jim Carrey does have a gift for slapstick comedy, making you laugh all the way to the bank, this is the second of the three movies that Tom Shadyac and Jim Carrey made together and to me it is also my second favorite after Bruce Almighty but before Ace Ventura.The thing for me is that Liar Lair, didn't strike as a very funny movie, after a while the slapstick humor become more annoying than it was entertaining. The storyline which has a sticking resemblance to a Twilight series episode which will be easy to catch by twilight fans, had the tale of not being able to lie for just 24 hours, while the Twilight series episode was about the protagonist not being able to lie as long as he owned a car or something.The movie plot is about a chronic liar and divorcée who has wrecked his home with his insensitivity, and his carelessness. With only one thing that is true in his life Fletcher (Jim Carrey) was still finding it hard to meet up to expectations as his constant lying was costing him his relationship with his son Max (Justin Cooper). After Fletcher blew off his son's birthday party to have sex with his co-worker (lying that he had to work) Max decided to make a wish that his father will not be able to lie for a whole 24 hours.Now Fletcher is a lawyer, who has a multi-million dollar case that he is on at the moment, a case all built on lies and he is finding it difficult to keep at it, since he can't lie nor ask a question knowing full well that the answer is a lie.Well Liar Liar found a way to make a man who is insensitive and not caring find a way to have a happy ending, and all he did to learn his lesson was winning a case with some honest deductions, and chasing his son on a hijacked mobile stairway in an airport which landed him on a stretcher.Like all other Tom and Carrey movies it was a box office hit, recouping its production cost and more. This is not my favorite Carrey movie and as I have said not my favorite of his duo with Tom Shadyac but Liar Liar has its moments. So if you are jumping on the wagon of a Carrey DVD collection; you may want to consider this one, but mind you to me it is just there.www.lagsreviews.com",6,1,2,23 December 2012
Wreck-It Ralph," Disney's 52nd is one to love
","The movie is full of entertainment and will appeal to a wide audience of both young and old, the video game references will be well received by older viewers, the younger viewers will love the rest the movie has to offer.Wreck-It Ralph is a 3D computer animated action comedy film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios not the usual Disney/Pixar combination and it is the 52nd animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series, after Winnie the Pooh 2011. The movie takes me back to the old days when graphics wasn't key when making a video game, just fun. I loved seeing M Bison and Zangief from Street Fighter.We all struggle with accepting who we are or accepting the purpose for which we are created, and that is what Wreck It Ralph is all about accepting yourself for who you are and being proud of it.My high in this movie is the support group for video game villains, all the villains had issues with being tagged as the bad guy.The movie had been in production since the 80s but had been pushed back a lot, but finally Disney went ahead and just like Who Framed Roger Rabbit 1988 Disney featured a lot of cameo characters from many video games like Clyde the orange ghost from Pac-Man, Doctor Eggman from Sonic the Hedgehog, and Bowser from Super Mario Bro.Wreck-It Ralph (voiced by Reilly) is a character in a video game, he is the bad guy and the games protagonist and his antagonist is the game's perfect Good Guy, Fix-It Felix (voice of McBrayer).Ralph is fed up of being the bad guy, as he wishes he too could get a hero's medal, so when he runs into a first person shooter game character that was running out of his mind, Ralph took the advantage of the knocked out character, took his gear and set himself up to be used to accomplish the games objective so as to get a medal.Things took a turn for the worse when Ralph found out that the character he was impersonating was in a game that was wild and dangerous, he panicked wrecked the gameplay and while the others were resetting for another run, Ralph broke all protocols as he went after the medal, he so desperately craved.The craving led to him breaking into another arcade game meeting Vanellope von Schweetz (voiced by Silverman), a young troublemaking 'glitch' from a candy-coated cart racing game, who turned Ralph's life around and showed him that there is more to life than his selfish ambition of being accepted by everyone.Wreck it Ralph is directed by Rich Moore who is best known for his work in the Simpsons.Rich Moore dropped an idea that he and Disney may do a sequel that may cross in to online and console gaming. Wreck it Ralph is one movie that you will enjoy on a nice afternoon with your kids or a group of your friends who will be thrilled to see some old favorite villains, it is a fun movie and I highly recommend that you get a taste of it.www.lagsreviews.com",7,1,2,15 November 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Good but kinda long
","Peter Jackson's The Hobbit has been a source of talk as many looked forward to going back to the Lord of the rings realm (Middle Earth). Based on J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit which happens to be one book, Peter Jackson is going to take one book and turn it into a trilogy, this movie alone seemed a little too long, and there was a time when I actually got tired, so I do hope the others are not going to follow suit.This movie reminds me more of the fellowship of the ring, first there is the gathering of the people that are going on the 'Journey' then there is the long wait while others in the various realms are briefed of the 'Journey', then there is the journey itself, although the Journey differs from the quest of Frodo and Sam but we are being briefed with the incidents that led to what in the 'Fellowship of the Ring.'Many after watching The Lord of the Rings trilogy went to go read the book, and like me, many discovered that there was a journey before The Lord of the Rings. How Bilbo came about the Ring and how insignificant it was in the book the Hobbits only to become overly significant in the remaining three books of The Lord of the Rings.As a prequel to The Lord of the Rings trilogy it does have many of the old cast from the trilogy showing up, we get to see Old Bilbo, Frodo, Elrond, Gollum, Saruman the White and Galadriel, all this were played by the same cast from the old Trilogy.Set sixty years before the events of The Lord of the Rings, this is a tale about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), who is asked to go on an adventure by a wizard, Gandalf the grey (Ian McKellen). The adventure will be one in which he will accompany thirteen dwarfs led by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) on a quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from Smaug the dragon. The thing about our return to Middle Earth is the scenery, the CGI is just too beautiful to overlook, the cinematography was just one thing, the blend between the characters and the scenery is another, this movie is a sight for sore eyes. You can tell right away that this is going to be a huge financial success.Martin Freeman and Ian McKellen, playing Young Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf the Grey respectively are the characters to watch out for in this flick. Then there is the point when all the boring talk and all the waiting brings you to, the battle between the Dwarfs and Gandalf vs the Goblins, that is where you will see CGI at its best, the Great Goblin was so ugly that seeing him alone can cause an heart attack. The battle to get away from the Goblin is one that will make you respect the visual art and effects that are put into these movies.My general consensus is; this is a good movie, a little too long though, but it is good to watch.www.lagsreviews.com",6,3,13,19 December 2012
Saving Private Ryan," a wonderful depiction of world war II
","This is my second favorite World War II movie after Schindler's List, which was also made by Steven Spielberg. Saving Private Ryan is captivating and also shows the whole events that war carries, the movie is well acclaimed for its graphic realistic depiction of World War II; since I wasn't there during it, if this is what war looks like, I pray to God that there is no World War III.The movie is about a United States Army Rangers Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) and seven other soldiers under him as they search for a paratrooper, Private First Class James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), who is the last-surviving brother of four servicemen and has been ordered by the President to be brought home as his family fears losing all five sons to the war.There is just one thing about this movie that cut my attention, after Hanks character Captain John H. Miller, drags he crew through the war losing many on their way in crude ways all in the name of finding Private Ryan, they finally found him and Ryan refuses to go back with them, claiming he doesn't need saving. Miller and the remaining of his crew then joins Ryan's course. If I was Miller I would have knocked him (Ryan) up the head and drag him home.Saving Private Ryan is a War Epic film, done by Steven Spielberg, who has been involved in some World War II films before this, like Empire of the Sun and Schindler's List. To prep the guys for the film the cast except from Matt Damon were sent to a ten days 'boot camp' for training and work on the film set to prepare them for their roles. The reason Damon was excluded was for the other cast to develop a form of resentment towards him, which will help in their reaction to him during filming.Critically noted for its portrayal of World War II, this film was released to a high positive acceptance and earned a whooping 11 nominations in the Academy Awards, going home with just 5, including winning Spielberg his second Academy Award as a director. The movies cinematography too has to be praised the movie shots during the world War II fight on Omaha beach is a classic to see, that scene has been noted as one of the greatest TV scenes of all time.Saving Private Ryan was also a commercial success, making more than 6 times its 70 million production cost and its home video sale was massive.This is a movie that I can bet my name on that you will enjoy, the depiction of the war sequence the sad end to lives during the war, the repercussion of cowardly behavior all added to the drama and the fun you will get while watching this war classic.www.lagsreviews.com",8,2,3,20 December 2012
Lawrence of Arabia," They don't make them like this anymore
","As far as classics go, Lawrence of Arabia carves a mark in the epic genre as one of the best epic movies out there.Based on the life of T. E. Lawrence, this movie depicts in full detail Lawrence's experiences in Arabia during World War I, with focus primarily on his attacks and conquest of Aqaba and Damascus and his involvement in the Arab National Council.The movie has well rooted scenes that take you through a journey of self discovery, we get to see the emotional struggles Lawrence faced and how the resulting violence caused by war can change a man completely.The desert scenes were shot in Jordan and Morocco.During filming Peter was having difficulty with the camel saddle so he bought rubber foam and placed it on the saddle, many extras copied him and it has become wide spread even till today.Later, during the filming of the Aqaba scene, O'Toole was nearly killed when he fell from his camel during the charge, but fortunately, it (the camel) stood over him, preventing the horses of the extras from trampling him.Many Arab countries including Jordan banned the film. Egypt, Omar Sharif's home country, was the only Arab nation to give the film a wide release, where it became a success.Peter O'Toole who played Lawrence delivered a much awarding performance; although he didn't win the best actor role in the Oscars he was nominated.Broken into two parts each over an hour and 40 minutes long, Lawrence was a British soldier whose flamboyant attitude made him popular among his fellow colleagues, he was sent to the desert plain to see to the Arabs, and from there he made friends with the Arabs.He fought with them and led them to victory, but his loyalties come into question as he was cutting across two territories the British government and his new found love, the Arabs.The script of the movie is well plotted and the screenplay is marvelous, add to that the cinematography, the musical score and the directing.Lawrence of Arabia is a complete package, a masterpiece waiting to be seen by anyone.What I really love about the script is how we get to see Lawrence move from nothing to hero, from hero to god and from god back to man.This movie launched Peter into the limelight and the character that catches your fancy may end up being Omar Sharif who played Sheriff Ali ibn el Kharish.The movie is fun to watch, I recommend it.",8,1,3,5 September 2012
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," not as good as the first
","The Lost World: Jurassic Park II is a sequel to Jurassic Park which is based on a Michael Crichton book of the same name (The Lost World: Jurassic Park II). This sequel is not as good as the first and also not as exciting, the whole dinosaur in the city (Godzilla kind), saving your love from an expedition that could be her last was kind of a bore but like the first the sequel doesn't fail to fill you up with new knowledge about speculated behaviors dinosaur.This science fiction adventure film was directed by Steven Spielberg and prompted the first time Crichton will write a sequel to a book. The movie was made darker than that of the first and it was also a box office success, grossing $618 million worldwide, although the movie itself was not of critical acclaim on the bases mostly because fans had to wait 4 years to see this, and though it did have an excellent CGI, the story was not as thrilling as the first, and the cast was not as engaging.The movie plot didn't have Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) in it at all, even the park genius John Hammond and his grandchildren Lex and Tim, just appeared briefly in the beginning of the movie.The movie focuses on Jeff Goldblum who played Dr. Ian Malcolm the Chaos theorist.The film picks up four years after the events of Jurassic Park, and Dr. Ian has gone everywhere telling everybody who cares to know about what he faced in Jurassic Park. John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) who had lost control of InGen to his nephew, Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard), invited Malcolm to his home to ask him to escort a team to a place called Site B.John explained to Malcolm that the island of Isla Sorna, also known as 'Site B', is the island where the dinosaurs were initially engineered and nurtured for a few months, before being moved to the location of the park.He further explained that after the Jurassic Park incident, a hurricane destroyed the containment facilities on Isla Sorna, and the dinosaurs have been living free in the wild ever since, and they have found a way to survive.Malcolm initially refuses thinking back on the events and his near survival from the park four years ago, but agrees after learning that his girlfriend, paleontologist Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore), is part of the team and is already there at the island.So we are back with the dinosaurs again with only Malcolm having an idea of what they are capable of.There were scenes in the movie where the camera angles were well positioned, but the movie screenplay lapsed in thrills.Other than the movie not being so a good sequel, many elements from the original Jurassic Park novel that was not in the first film were used here. www.lagsreviews.com",6,1,3,27 October 2012
Django Unchained," Nice
","Django Unchained is a movie that captivates your interest from the very beginning, I have seen nice intros for movie protagonist, but the one Quentin Tarantino dished out for Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) is one I will not forget that easily because after I saw that I was hooked and looked forward to seeing how the movie was going to play out. The great thing about this nearly 3 hours movie is that, never a dull moment. The lead actors (Christoph Waltz, Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio) were just too good, that you looked forward to see them each time. Django Unchained I can boldly say lived up to the hype that it claimed, a beautiful action pack movie for all (above 17) to see.Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino and released on Christmas Day of 2012, the movie is said to be set two years before the American Civil War. Tarantino, got inspiration for the film from Sergio Corbucci 1966 movie Django and also inspiration was also gotten from the 1975 film Mandingo. After Tarantino was done with the script, the Weinstein Company picked it up for production with 83 million dollars, casting Jamie Foxx in the lead role.The movie is about love and revenge; the two most deadly forces collide in this movie. Django (Jamie Foxx) was a slave being taken to be sold, when a bounty hunter approached the men that were taken him and started questioning the slaves to see who knew some men he was hunting, Django knew them and after some unforeseen circumstances both roll out as bounty hunters.Django only wanted one thing and that is to free his wife, but in order to be able to free his wife they have to fool Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) and this must be done while the heavily suspicious Steven (Samuel L. Jackson) is watching.The movie isn't all sunshine, there were some let downs, like the intensive violence were sometimes unneeded, the heavy use of the word 'Nigger' may not go down well with some and I guess if you are one for history, the depiction of slavery as a western shootout may not go down well with you. The time of slavery were hard times not gun slinging times.Putting that aside Django Unchained is a good movie one you will enjoy. It also got an accolade from The American Film Institute; they included the movie in their Top Ten Movies of the Year in December 2012.www.lagsreviews.com",7,1,4,9 January 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," an awesome follow up to the fellowship of the ring
","The captivating thing about Two Towers is the fight choreography and the battle at Helm's Deep (which was kind of the movie's climax), it is one that you will not forget that easily and the movie is just another powerful extension of what Peter Jackson could do, the movie is filled with a lot more CGI (from my view) than the first, and it may not be the best of the three, but Two Towers delivered some powerful performances, especially from Aragon (Viggo Mortensen), the Dwarf Gimli (John Rhys- Davies) and the Elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom).After you have watched The Fellowship of the Rings, you are ever so eager to see what the Fellowship, (which is now broken into three groups Frodo with Sam, Pippin with Merry and Aragon with Legolas and Gimli) will be able to achieve on their own, as part of the master plan to destroy the ring at Mount Doom. The interesting thing about watching this flick is that some managed victory in their own areas, giving you the viewer a delightful hope, while Frodo (Elijah Woods) and Sam (Sean Astin) were moving closer to their target.The movie's plot is focused mostly on the battle at Helm's Deep. The other fellowship members except Frodo and Sam and after the fall of Gandalf when he battled the Balrog, chased after the Uruk-hai who took Merry and Pippin so as to rescue them. While they chased Merry and Pippin found an adventure of their own in the forest. The rescuers Aragon, Gimli and Legolas found themselves in Rohan and had to save the king and defend the city from an attack from Saruman's forces, this defense and intense battle happened at Helm's Deep.The three most notable changes in the movie compared to the book that I picked up instantly are (although many other differences can be found) 1. In the book Theoden is just depressed and deluded by Wormtongue but in the movie he is possessed by Saruman. The second is about Theeoden, who didn't just run to Helm's Deep as the movie made it see, he actually fought at first. The last was the exclusion of Shelob, who was later included in the final movie of the trilogy.Not winning as much as the first, Two Towers won two Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best sound Editing. It was a commercial success making close to 10 times its 94 million dollars production cost. Not as much of a powerful score like The Fellowship of the Ring the movie is a nice follow up to the first, and it served like a bridge from an excellent beginning in the trilogy (in the fellowship of the ring) to a magnificent ending (in the Return of the King). You can't watch the first only without seeing this also, so get the DVD box set and enjoy.www.lagsreviews.com",8,0,1,6 January 2013
Schindler's List," One of a kind
","Schindler's List tells the tale of a German industrialist Oskar Schindler (28 April 1908 – 9 October 1974) who was credited to have saved over 1,100 Jews during the Holocaust.The movie is based on the book Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally. Steven Spielberg both directed and produced this movie, and has been received widely as a classic.The thing that catches your eye when watching this movie is the cruelty of war itself, there are just mainly losers no winners, only those who happen to be in-between that suffers, the men behind it sit behind a desk. Spielberg depicted such cruelty in the Camps.A scene where a Jew who made hinges was moved from where he is working to go shove coal and then when he was done he returned, Amon Göth (Ralph Fiennes) queried him for not meeting up to his regular toll of hinges and immediately had him arraigned to be executed, for something that was not his fault. That scene touched me.The movie was shot in Kraków, Poland for seventy-one days. Shots were done in real life locations, though the Płaszów camp had to be reconstructed in a pit adjacent to the original site, due to post-war changes to the original camp.The plot of the movie is direct; a German businessman named Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) in Poland sees an opportunity to make money from the Nazis' rise to power. He starts a company to make cookware and utensils, using bribes to win military contracts, and bringing in an accountant and financier Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to help run the factory.He then hires Jews for the cheap pay, but later after witnessing the cruelty they face in the Nazi Camps, he then tried to get as much Jews away from the Camps to his factory, using all his savings to take care of them.The movie is not so bad when it comes to acting, but the main hat dipping should go to the Screenplay and the directing. The Screenplay and the script had to be perfect in other for us to be able to get the feel of what the Jews were going through. Also the directing had to be top notch so as not to get carried away by the suffering or the cruelty but to understand why a German will like to save the Jews.Although we know that much has been done by Liam Neeson (Taken), Ralph Fiennes (Harry Potter) and Ben Kingsley (Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time) over the years, but they will be fondly remembered for their role in this classic.Take a 3 hour break from your busy schedule and watch this movie. It is one of a kind.",8,15,23,4 September 2012
The Incredibles," it is truly incredible
","This is my bankable companion for action, The Incredibles is an action packed and comedy filled computer animation superhero film, which juggles between the superhero life and the suburban life. The movie transcend beyond the natural computer animation that Pixar was used to, it contained an all human cast, that took the winds out of the Pixar animators, due to the intensity of work that had to be done to create these characters. The Incredibles is one movie that you can adapt to with ease, finding fun on every turn.After his disappointing movie The Iron Giant (1999) which has been said was due to marketing gone wrong, Brad Bird was down in the blues and he then focused more attention on developing a movie idea he had been working on for some time, it pitched the idea to Pixar's John Lasseter who liked it and brought Bird on board the Pixar team to make the movie. The idea was about a superhero family, with the father going through midlife crises. Bird's refusal to settle for less caused the movie to go through numerous delays, as the animators had to work out the kinks in creating human skin, human clothing, and hair animation in water, air, fire and smoke, to make the characters look real.The movie does pose some dark parts, with death all well assured and the non hesitant of any of the characters to pull the trigger on the opposing sides, even the children of Mr. Incredible and ElastiGirl were no different, they were not taken unawares or felt any remorse when the opposition died in explosions, while the opposition was trying to kill them, neither were they moved or objected to their parents use of deadly force which resulted into the death of the opposing characters. That is something about the movie that I feel kids should not be exposed to too much.The incredibles was a theatrical success, winning Two Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature and Best Sound Editing. It cleared the box office getting home over 630 million compared to its 92 million production cost. It also spawned out comics and numerous merchandises. At least till date 3 video games have been released based on the film characters and adventures.The Incredibles is fun all the way the kind of fun you get when watching a good action flick mixed with a wonderful sitcom. It is one of a kind and a sequel to this movie is one that I have been waiting for since its release, I just hope I don't have to wait too long.www.lagsreviews.com",8,1,1,27 December 2012
Cars 2," Aren't you tired of part 2s???
","The idea of taking the spotlight off McQueen is a development that the writers and the screenplay writers hoped will make the movie one for the Oscars. Well...it didn't quite pan out that way, and ended up missing the mark. The movie has some thrilling races, wonderful sceneries, if there is an award for best animation scenery shots OH! Cars will get it.Pixar is Known for its memorable animations, pulling out Characters like the ones we see in Finding Nemo and Toy Story, Challenging our imagination Ratatouille and Monsters Inc, matured action like that from The Incredibles and of course the emotional touch of Up and WALL-E, but like the first Cars which fell short of the other master pieces this one too follow suit.Cars 2 fall behind of all the greatest from Pixar except its original Cars. This is the first Pixar animation am sure won't put up a fight for best animation in the Oscars. Cars originally have a weak story and the sequel just made it glaring. Preferable to the original though cause of the fast paced scenes and it still had its humorous times the movie itself seems to be made for kids.It has a G rating and I recall asking myself, hey isn't that a torture scene, and I also recall going I think that Car (also those Cars) are dead.I guess its high time studios take a pause from all this part 2, 3 or 4. Cause it's starting to get old.Here is the plot, Lightning McQueen has been challenged to a series of races by the Italian speedster Francesco Bernoulli, a challenge he accepted. Sally then convinces him to take Mater with him. Somewhere else, the smooth Bond like British spy car Finn McMissile (Michael Caine), assisted by Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer), are trying to foil a plot by a criminal mastermind.Now the criminal mastermind's plot is so twisted and complicated that after you figure it out in a sec, you say 'hmm!!!' The British spies by some rare coincidence mistake the bumbling tow trucker Mater for an American spy, and the rusty cling cling and the two spies engage in a thrilling adventure, to saveÂ…'the financial market, and also Cars of cause'",6,0,1,27 June 2011
Ghostbusters," who you gonna call
","With lines that you can quote on a daily basis, and a theme song that just sticks to your head, the Ghostbusters is a movie to watch. The line 'Who You Gonna Call?' is well used in real life and even in the movie world as a tribute to the theme music. Ghostbusters is a film that has been tagged as one of the best comedies of 1984, the movie used a lot of special effects to pass it's message across, and the powerful acting of Bill Murray (Peter) made this movie an infectious plague that as soon as you pass by while it is running on TV you just take a sit to see it again.The film was followed by a sequel, Ghostbusters II in 1989 and the movie franchise grew to include two animated television series one named The Real Ghostbusters show casing more adventures of the original four and Extreme Ghostbusters about a new team of busters mentored by Egon.Written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis the movie is about three eccentric parapsychologists in New York City, who start a ghost catching business. The movie original idea which was written by Aykroyd was a little too bogus and out of this world to have worked, as it features a group of Ghostbusters travelling through time and going to other dimensions fighting ghost. They group used wands instead of proton packs to fight the ghosts.When the story was pitched to the director and producer of this 1984 classic, Ivan Reitman, Reitman bought the idea but felt the script was just off, so Harold Ramis came on board and he and Aykroyd worked on the script for a three week period, making it more realistic and more tuned down.The Characters for the movie were meant to be played by Belushi, Eddie Murphy, and John Candy. But Belushi died during the writing of the screenplay and Murphy and Candy didn't want the roles, so Ayrkroyd and Ramis re-wrote the characters took the roles themselves and brought Bill Murray on board, an addition which was well received.The movie plot is about three unemployed parapsychology scientist who got fired from their jobs in the university for their weird behaviour and intrigue by the paranormal. The trio Dr Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Dr Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) and Dr Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) decided to rent an old firehouse to set shop and started trapping ghost, spirits and poltergeist for money. They decided to hire an extra help and got Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson) in on the ghost busting business.But things took a change for the worse when they stumbled upon a gateway into another dimension and an evil waiting to break free into this world, the group now have to go save the world from this impending disaster.The Ghostbusters is a classic comedy/Sci Fi movie that all should watch and own, the movie has so much details and fun that you find yourself captivated by the whole idea of Ghost busting. The sequel was just as good.www.lagsreviews.com",8,1,1,17 December 2012
Lincoln," Wonderfully done
","Lincoln is wonderful and Daniel Day-Lewis performance in this movie is worth his academy award nomination as Best Actor, Day-Lewis has twice won the Academy Award for Best Actor for the movies My Left Foot in 1989 and There Will Be Blood in 2007.Steven Spielberg put his mastery directing skills to work in this future classic, he also produced the movie. This movie shows the final moments of Abe Lincoln in office as the president of the United States. At that time the country was at war and at the very edge of change, Lincoln was in the driving sit against all oppositions to end the war and bring an end to slavery. The movie also depicts the steps taken by Lincoln and his party to get others at their side so as to win the necessary votes needed to end slavery.I did enjoy Daniel's portrayal, his voice and also his movements. Spielberg didn't fail to add the aspect of Lincoln story telling into this movie, as we get to hear many of his stories as he used them to pass his message across.This movie is very great and wonderful, and I'm glad I got to see it. I'm not an American never had it in mind to be one, but the singular act by Lincoln abolished slavery and made it possible for the Negro race to be seen as equal, although years of more battles and more assassinations led to the freedom that we see today, down to the point that a Black Man is now the President of America and he even won a second term in office.For historical purposes, this movie did have its inaccuracies but not withstanding it is a nice documentary drama for those who want to know the battles that engaged when Lincoln was trying to end the war, from the battles at the war front, to the one at the senate and then not to mentions Lincoln's battle at home, here is a movie to see.Did I enjoy this movie? Yes I did, but if you are not into history nor documentary you may find this movie a bore; Lincoln is a critical and commercial successful movie and it is one for the record books that I am sure of.After seeing Silver Lining Playbook I believed that none could match up to what Bradley Cooper delivered, but this acting by Daniel Day-Lewis matches up to it and even surpasses it from my view, so my Oscar winner for Best Actor should be Day-Lewis.www.lagsreviews.com",7,0,1,21 February 2013
Million Dollar Baby," Eastwood at his best
","Clearing the best picture award in the 77th academy Award is a film that makes you smile and cry at the same time. The movie's twist ending is what makes it a grand slam and Hilary Swank, finally after a long time pulled out a role that can be said to match the one she performed in the 1999 drama Boys Don't Cry. She also won an Academy Award for best actress twice one for Boys Don't Cry in 1999 and the other for her role here in Million Dollar Baby.The movie is about a boxing trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), who helped an underdog amateur boxer Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank) achieve her dream. Frankie only decided to help Maggie when she persisted to keep training at his gym till Dunn finally deciding to help her to become a professional boxer.All with the aim that when she is up on her feet he will give her up to another manager, during training Dunn always tells Maggie to defend herself at all times.Morgan Freeman's inclusion in this movie is one that makes you know that a film with this guy as your supporting actor is going to be a hit. Freeman managed to shine behind the huge shadow of Clint Eastwood and he delivered my favorite scene in the movie, where his character Eddie 'Scrap-Iron' Dupris, an elderly former boxer and Frankie Dunn's (Clint Eastwood) partner, who is blind in one eye went into the ring to take on a younger boxer who had just bullied and knocked the wind out of an autistic young man. Dupris steps in the ring and squares out with the younger boxer who was hesitant ay first to go toe to toe with an old man, but later decided to square it out. After he (the younger boxer) has given the one eyed blind Dupris enough jabs in the face, Dupris landed only one punch and well, the younger boxer learnt a lesson he will never forget.The movie does have its controversy, as the trailers makes you think this is a movie about a fighter who managed to conquer some fits to become great, when actually it is a tragedy waiting to happen. The movie's ending too is not without its nay-sayers, who feel the ending was just too sad and it mocked and gave the wrong idea for what to do about your disability.Whether you get all depressed although the movie or you applaud the great movie for its insightful portrayal on female boxing or maybe you are like me who just love a good movie and give it is due credit, one thing is, you have to see Million dollar Baby yourself to come to a better conclusion.www.lagsreviews.com",8,0,1,20 December 2012
The Nightmare Before Christmas," wonderful
","Ironically this is my favorite of all Christmas Cartoons, I cherish each time I spend watching this movie, it is my all time Christmas recipe to a Merry Christmas. Leave it to the team at Halloween Town to make jingle bells sound dead and horrific. Based on a poem written by Tim Burton in 1982, The Nightmare Before Christmas is a musical fantasy horror stop motion animation, which features the Stop Motion director Henry Selick (James and The Giant Peach and Coraline 2009).Disney first decided to make this movie as a short 30 minutes TV movie, but later decided to go ahead and make a full length animation but released it under their Touchstone Pictures Distribution name and not under their Walt Disney name because they feared, since it was a dark horror animation it will not be well received. The Nightmare Before Christmas became a hit critically and commercially, and Burton has had a time convincing Disney to drop the idea of a sequel whenever it came up.The movie plot is about Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king of Halloween Town, who was bored of doing the same thing over again, year in year out he has remained the pumpkin king, so on one lonely stroll he stumbled on Christmas town, saw the joy all around and decided to give Santa Claus a vacation, by kidnapping him, and he breathed a new dawn into Halloween Town where they will take over Christmas and Halloween it up.Due to Burton's busy schedule working on Batman Returns he was not available to direct this movie so Henry Selick was called upon to do the honors. The maker constructed 227 puppets for the film and Jack himself having close to four hundred heads to display his speech and emotions. With most of the film being songs, the voice of Jack was played by Chris Sarandon for speech and Danny Elfman the film's composer provided Jack's singing voice.The Nightmare Before Christmas was a critical success as previously said, holding a rating of 96% in Rotten Tomatoes and making over 75 million dollars in the box office, compared to its 18 million production cost and due to its wide acceptance Disney has reissued the film under their Disney Digital 3-D format, it then became the first stop-motion animated feature to be entirely converted to 3-D.Here is a classic Christmas drama about Santa coming to the rescue, Jack Skellington and the crew of Halloween town, are always ready to welcome you whenever you come watching, just be careful to stay away from the Oogie Boogie man, and buy this DVD.www.lagsreviews.com",8,1,1,25 December 2012
Brave," Not so special but not that bad
","Enjoyable, especially if you don't know much about the movie and you stayed away from the trailers, I was surprised at the turn of events majorly the whole mother and daughter connection. A change from the regular, having a female lead is something, having two female leads and no romance or male attachment involved is a stab in the dark.Was I looking forward to what will happen next each time? YES.Brave is a 3D computer-animated fantasy adventure film from Pixar. It was set in the highlands of 10th century Scotland, and the lead role Merida is Pixar's first female protagonist. The movie is directed by Brenda Chapman who is Pixar's first female director and she also wrote the story.The thing I want you to look out for when you are watching this movie is Merida's brothers, those kids were a menace to the power of 3.Giving you the plot of the movie without revealing much is going to be quite hard, but I will try. Merida defies an age-old custom, causing chaos in her kingdom. After consulting with a witch for help, she is given a cake that caused a change of events in her family, now Merida has to undo the spell herself before it is too late.The movie's flow is kind of shallow, and the movie looked short, like more could have happened and it didn't. You will love the scenery and the way the women were different from the men in the area of manners and thought. The movie did drive a message though, that both mothers and daughters have to communicate, with both leaving room to understand the other. But the message may not go down well the male viewers who were probably looking for some action.Voice casting is a part of the movie I enjoyed. It was Scottish to the core.I can't say for certain if the movie will bring in the regular money that Pixar is use to too, but I do know it is not a bad watch. It is something you will enjoy.",6,1,4,27 June 2012
Jerry Maguire," Show me the money!!!
","A desperate man trying to make it on its own, a love story waiting to happen, movie lines that have stood the test of time and add an egotistic maniac, Cameron Crowe has a masterpiece waiting to explode on your TV screens if you have not been fortunate enough to have seen Jerry Maguire already.Written, produced and directed by Cameron Crowe, Jerry Maguire was received with a number of accolades, one being Best Supporting Actor for Cuba Gooding Jr. in the Academy awards, Chicago Film critics association, Screen Actors Guild and Satellite Awards.The movie launched Renée Zellweger into the limelight and it is one of the best written movies I have ever seen. Jerry Maguire spawned several popular quotations, including 'Show me the money!', 'You complete me', 'Help me help you', and 'You had me at 'hello''. These lines are largely attributed to Cameron Crowe.The great thing about Jerry Maguire will be unique to each viewer, is it the trust bond between Jerry (Tom Cruise) and Rod (Cuba Gooding Jr.) or the love between Rod and Marcee (Regina King) or the romantic story between Jerry and Dorothy (Renée Zellweger). Whatever it is that you like, the movie is full of it.The plot, Jerry is a sports agent who developed a moral epiphany one night; he decided to write it all down. Still in the drive he went ahead printed it and sent it to all members of his staff. He got fired for expressing it; he decides to put his philosophy to the test as an independent.He tried all his best to keep his clients but only one stayed with him, Rod Tidwell an ego maniac, it all seems rosy at first and then it all went downhill for Jerry.He then realized what mattered most in life.Before Jerry Maguire Cuba was known for his movie Boyz n the Hood where he played Tre, he also was in a few good men with Tom Cruise. Cruise however was coming from a breakthrough role in his movie Mission Impossible, to star in this one.After Jerry both actors have grown to be a well-known name in the movie industry with Tom sticking to the high rollers and Cuba staying with direct to DVD releases from 2009 – 2011.This movie is a most see, so don't chicken out go see it.",8,1,1,3 September 2012
Here Comes the Boom," not so good
","The movie is a good idea, bad idea mix up for Kevin James.Good idea, make a movie about inspiring young people to go for what they want in life no matter the course.Bad idea, write it yourself.I think James should allow others to do the writing when it comes to movies.This sports comedy film is directed by Frank Coraci who directed three of Adam Sandler hit movies from The Wedding Singer in 1995, The Waterboy in 1998 to Click in 2006.Frank Coraci movie after Click was Zookeeper, which also starred Kevin James and although it was a box office success it was panned by critics and had an approval rating of 14% from Rotten Tomatoes, and it was also nominated for a Razzie Award.This new movie that the duo is involved in is better than Zookeeper that I can assure, but it is still shy away from being a hit.The movie plot is about a Former collegiate wrestler Scott Voss (Kevin James) who now works as a biology teacher and doesn't take his work serious, due to boredom.The school he is in is failing badly and there was a need to cut cost, so the music class and the teacher had to be cut.Scott then jumps up to try and raise money to save the music teacher's (Henry Winkler) job.This endeavor made him take on another job as an instructor for a citizenship class. The job wasn't paying enough though but there he met Niko (Bas Rutten), who asked him for some more tutoring.He goes to Niko's apartment to tutor him when he found out that Niko was a former mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter.He also leant that if he can make it into the UFC he can make $ 10,000 for losing so he trained for the part.The movie features the 2002 song BOOM by P.O.D, as well as numerous songs from the likes of Neil Diamond.Boasting of wonderful cinematography as the fights go on, the cinematographer in this movie is Phil Meheux. Meheux is the cinematographer behind one of the best James Bond movies out there GoldenEye 1995.Kevin James was a star as usual in this movie, somehow you just get to love him, but everyone else just strolls by, except Henry Winkler (Fonzie as he is popular known that is if you are familiar with the 1970s American sitcom Happy Days.) Winkler I actually enjoyed.Salma Hayek again has settled for a movie that is beneath her standard.I won't dash off to the theaters to see this movie.www.lagsreviews.com",4,10,20,31 October 2012
Hotel Transylvania," Yawn!
","I made a lot of attempts to get to see this movie; I was so  disappointed after 30 minutes in.  I like being surprised by the story a movie delivers, so sometimes  instead of reading ahead i just go to the cinema to be surprised. When  I found out what the plot was for this movie I felt like shooting  myself in the foot for not reading ahead.  Produced by Sony Pictures Animation, Hotel Transylvania has been in  development since 2006 with Miley Cyrus penned to play the voice of  Mavis (Dracula's daughter), but she later dropped the role and Selena  Gomez was given the role instead.  The movie's idea was to paint a scenario typical to that of  Pixar/Disney's Monsters Inc, where the monsters were afraid of the  humans, although in this twist the humans seems to love the Monsters.  Every movie runs on a typical fuel, Monsters Inc's fuel was they need  of screams for their energy, the fuel in this movie is Mavis (Selena  Gomez) desire to go to the outside world. This kind of driving force  for a movie is too flat based on the fact that the outside world is  just outside your door.  The voice casting/acting in this movie is not half as bad as the plot.  Adam Sandler voiced Dracula and did a fine job at it too. The movie's  plot is about Dracula, who lost his wife to an attack by humans.  Due to that, he built a hotel where the world's monsters can take a  rest from human civilization. In his list of invitees we have 1.  Frankenstein and his bride 2. Werewolf, his bride and their liter (and  may I tell you they have so much) 3. Mummy 4. Skeleton and bride 5.  Invisible man 6. And much more.  The movie does try to be funny, with lines like when Dracula told the  Invisible man, 'Hello! Great to see you'  The movie director Genndy Tartakovsky is behind the some notable  Cartoon Network animated television series, including Dexter's  Laboratory, Samurai Jack, Star Wars: Clone Wars, and Sym-Bionic Titan.  Genndy will also be directing an animated film based on Popeye.  Hotel Transylvania will have been best as a short movie that was like  30 mins long rather than a full length one that has nothing but wasted  scenes luring you to an expected end.  But putting it all together if you haven't heard of this movie then be  happy, you are not missing a thing.",4,5,11,12 October 2012
Toy Story," Nothing steps to this... Disney/ Pixar's first
","Every child dreams of his toys coming to life and playing back, but the main idea has always been what it will be like if toys did come to life. Well Toy Story answered that question in a more enlighten way that made you eager to see more of the adventures Andy's toys were getting into. Toy Story has a masterpiece storyline that makes you just sit and wonder, the screenplay that blends this toy acts to human interaction is so well done, that if not that the fact that this can't be true, this movie may make kids think this is possible.The movie is about a group of toys who pretend to be lifeless whenever humans are present and come to life to discuss, when humans are not around. The toys behavior, actions and fears are all based on their need to be played with by their owner.This group of toys belong to a boy named Andy, and the Andy's favorite toy is Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), a cowboy dull. Things were rosy when Woody was on top, but then came a new toy who took Woody's place Buzz (Tim Allen). Now Woody who feels threatened tries to get back at Buzz but he drags himself down with his acts, and now he may never see Andy again.Toy Story was the first fully computer animated feature film at its time and it came about when Disney approached Pixar to produce a computer animated feature for them after seeing their short animated film Tin Toy (1988). The production of this movie went through many ups and downs, mostly due to the fact that Disney wanted a story that was nail biting and out of this world perfect, which caused Pixar to work on re-writes that saw the lead characters changing form till they finally settled on Woody the wise leader of the Toys in Andy's room and Buzz the new addition to Andy's toys who is confused as to who he really is.Then there was the talk between Pixar and Disney about songs. Disney's movies at that time were all musicals with the characters breaking into songs, to further pass their message along, but John Lasseter didn't want that at all claiming this is a buddy film, so the two reached a compromise, that the score of the movie will be directed towards the action at hand at the point. That can be seen in the movie at one point when Buzz wanted to fly out the window to prove that he could fly and that he was not a 'Toy'. The song that was playing during that scene of Buzz trying to fly had such lyrics as: ...no, it can't be true, I can fly if I wanted to.Toy Story received massive recognition during its time Review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes has the movie at a 100% approval rating from critics and it also won Three Academy Awards (for Best Original Song, Best Original Score and Best Screenplay).The movie was a financial success, and it gave birth to two other sequels which were bigger financial success Toy Story 2 (released in 1999 and gaining 100% approval at Rotten Tomatoes) and Toy story 3 (released in 2010 and gaining 99% approval at Rotten Tomatoes and it is the highest grossing animation till date making over 1 billion dollars). There was also a direct-to-video animated film titled Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins (about Buzz) and also an animated television series Buzz Lightyear of Star Command.Toy Story is a classic true and true one DVD you should own.www.lagsreviews.com",8,0,0,27 December 2012
Men in Black," What a classic
","It was the year 1997, and the greatest agent the world has ever known was planning to retire and he needed to acquire and train his replacement. Who best to fit his shoes than Agent Jay (Will Smith).This movie made us understand why strange things and strange people roam around, with a solid plot that keeps you guessing 'where is the galaxy?' 'If it is here on earth and it is meant to be millions of stars where on earth could you hide that?' Leave it to the men in black, they not only found the galaxy and save the world from the Arquillians who were going to vaporize the whole planet earth to stop the bugs from getting the galaxy.I loved this movie in 1997 and I still love it now, listening to the soundtrack, doing the moves... all brings back fun memories of my youth. But the point am trying to make is, what makes a movie great is the ability to stand the test of time, no matter when you watch it be it 15 years after its initial release it will always be a classic.Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, who did a great job directing the screenplay and story done by Ed Solomon comes this well put together movie flick that mixes comedy with fantasy and a lot of action.Comparing this to its part 2 will be an unfair comparison, why? Because Men In Black 2 lacked the action and comedy to keep you watching, something Men In Black one had a lot of. I have to give kudos to the graphics it is far better than what I saw in Men In Black 2, also the screenplay is masterful each scene had enough happenings to keep you hoping the scene will drag longer.The producers are planning a Men In Black 3, something I hope will be better than 2, the Men In Black 3 coming out in May 2012 will be taking in a huge budget of over 200 Million dollars in production, something I hope will be put to good use.The Men In Black movie, led to the creation of the MIB animation series that span 4 seasons of 53 episodes. What can I say, but the franchise is a goldmine, one which the producers want to dig till there is nothing left.All in all, go see this movie whether you have seen it before or not.",9,0,0,5 April 2012

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," This is a movie you will not want deleted from your memory
","This movie shows us how wanting to erase of an incident that happened may not be a good idea.We are primarily watching the film primarily through the mind of the lead character Joel Barish (Jim Carrey).Winning the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, Eternal sunshine was a critical success, even financially.The movie was like being trapped in the mind of Joel and trying so hard to keep one thing from flying away, the memory of Clementine. We run through his life with Clementine (Kate Winslet) and wonder why they never seem to work it out.The director made some on the spot cuts from the movie, as this movie had a lot of deleted scenes all done to make the movie more presentable and make a balance between both lead characters.The director Michel Gondry (Be Kind Rewind (2008) and The Green Hornet (2011)) did a fine job with this movie as every moment you spend watching this movie is a moment in your memory you will not want erased.The movie is about two lovers, Joel (Carrey) and Clementine (Winslet) who undergo a procedure to erase each other from their memories because of how their relationship turned out.But as the process is being done, they discover how much they will lose when the memory is gone.This is one movie that will stand out in your books as one of the best movies you have seen.",8,0,1,8 September 2012
Taken," Don't mess with this guy
","Taken is a cult classic with a huge following, and all this is due to its portrayal of a former CIA who was ready to do anything to get back his kidnapped daughter. The movie's intense following is due to its violent nature portrayed by Liam Neeson, as he was a James Bond, Jason Borne and Rambo all rolled up into one chasing down a group of Armenians and making them pay dearly for even thinking about taking his daughter.The film was so well received by audience that it raked in a high 200 million dollars from its 25 million dollars production cost, Luc Besson was the man behind the direction and the writing of this cult classic and he was called back to come make the sequel Taken 2, which was released in 2012.The movie is about Ex-CIA operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson), whose daughter gets kidnapped when she travels to Paris to follow U2 during their European tour. With only a picture of his daughter at the airport, the voice of the man who took her, Bryan is racing against time to save his daughter before she is shipped out of the country and not seen again.Liam Neeson's performance in this movie is what is captivating; his character's ability to keep calm and think his way through any situation is what makes Bryan Mills the wrong guy to mess with (elements of Jason Borne), he used every known way alive to track down these guys, even shooting a friend's wife just to get the man to talk. He placed himself in danger numerous times but was able to find a way out at all times making him Bond and Rambo.At the end of this movie, you will be queuing up for seconds. My favourite action scene is when Bryan corned Peter (the man who leads the kidnappers to his daughter) in a taxi in Paris and starts to punch his ribs in, giving him details of how his ribs and lungs may not survive another punch if Peter doesn't give him all the information he wants to know. Here is a DVD that i couldn't help but owning.Mind you Taken 2 was just same same, with him and wife taken now and he just having to be Bryan and he breaks free tracks down the guys again and messes them up. Taken 2 is just a speck in the dark compared to this grand master.www.lagsreviews.com",8,0,0,20 December 2012
Toy Story 2," just as good as the first
","After the success of their first movie together, Disney/Pixar went ahead to make many more movies together, but soon they returned to the movie that started it all, Toy Story, but Disney's initial plan was for Toy Story 2 to be a home video, but upon reading the script and seeing the reels they noticed the possibilities of another blockbuster lurks, so Disney pumped money into it, recalled the voice cast and Toy Story 2 was made, a wonderful additional to its 1995 original.Toy Story 2, picks up from where the last one stopped, and it didn't neglect to let us know that Andy himself is getting older; the puppy and the Mrs Potatoe Head toy mentioned at the end of the first film are also featured in this movie, their addition to the clan, was so well done that you will not feel like they were crowding. Then the adventure in this movie is not a Woody trying to clear himself, it is a save woody adventure. The movie's directing is just as good as the first, the score not so great but it is negligible and the CGI is upgraded.The movie plot sees Woody (Tom Hanks) get stolen by a collector, the other toys noticed this theft and with Buzz (Tim Allen) hell bend to save Woody, recruited some other toys: Rex, Mr Potatoe Head, Slinky Dog and Hamm the piggy bank on a journey to go save Woody from his captor.The crew that went to save Woody made the movie for me; their addition took the scope away from what the first movie was all about, Woody and Buzz. This movie too is about Woody but now some other toys too are involved in this outside rescue.The idea for a sequel was being put together after the release of the first, but production faced a lot of hiccups on the way mostly due to Disney's set release date of the film costing Pixar to work at a fast pace to meet the set release date. The movie story had a lot of recycled ideas that were in the draft of the first film, which were discarded. This ideas included but not limited to, the obsessive toy collector, who here in this movie is the main antagonist (Sid Philips, Andy's former neighbor before they moved was the first movie's antagonist).Upon its release Toy Story 2 cost 90 million dollars to make and it recruited over 480 million from the box office making it a commercial success. The high approval rating of the film puts it in the league of movies (rare movies) whose sequels are regarded to be just as good as the original or even better.Toy Story 2 is a fun and great movie.www.lagsreviews.com",8,0,1,28 December 2012
Some Like It Hot," You will love this
","I haven't seen a more perfect comedy and cast than this in a while.Watching this in 2012 and I still find myself laughing my heads off. Thinking, 'So this is comedy cross-dressing is supposed to be.' (that is looking at you Big Momma and Tyler Perry) Ranked as the greatest American comedy by AFI (as at Oct 2012), the movie is a remake of a 1935 French movie, Fanfare d'Amour and was meant to be shut in color but as the makeup of both Curtis and Lemmon was obvious it was then shut in black and white.Marilyn Monroe can carve a M in to a rock with her smile and her acting is so well done that you are intrigued to see her anytime. Monroe is known mostly as a sex icon, and this movie assisted in such claims as the dresses she wore were more too seductive to be classified as funny. To say she had the movie by the balls will be a statement men will agree to, when they are watching this flick.The plot is about two male musicians who will do absolutely anything for money as they are constantly broke. They were in the wrong place at the wrong time and witness a mobster performing his 'executionary' duties. This made them run off while being shut at.To hide from their pending death, they took a job as musicians in an all-girl band. So to fit in they shaved their legs, wore makeup and wore a dress to pass as women.But things took a turn for the worse when Marilyn Monroe strolled by.The film was awarded an Academy Award for Best Costume Design. It also won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy. Marilyn Monroe won the Golden Globe for Best Actress in Musical or Comedy, and Jack Lemmon for Best Actor in Musical or Comedy.Billy Wilder the director is one of only five people to have won Academy Awards as producer, director, and writer for the same film (The Apartment). Tony Curtis has been in over a 100 films and he is the father of actress Jamie Lee Curtis.Lemmon is popular in these days as the actor in the movie Odd Couple.Some Like It Hot, is a movie I advise you watch over and over again. Like the last line of the movie goes 'Nobody is perfect' I say I'm not the perfect comedy judge but I wanna know if you agree with me.www.lagsreviews.com",8,2,2,11 October 2012
Pulp Fiction," Tarantino's best
","This Academy Award winning screenplay was done by Quentin Tarantino, the story is nonlinear and the screenplay is rich and the movie is full of stars. Tarantino's dream of making the movie look bigger than it actually is was achieved. Made with 8.5 million dollars, the movie looked like it was made with more. The story arc although it curves around 3 main and distinctive people and 3 main distinctive stories, it still has a way of reeling you in and keeping you attentive without losing you along the way.Meant to be a trilogy of three shorts, rather than a full length feature, it was first written by Roger Avary in the fall of 1990, while Tarantino worked on the script development 2 years after, the movie was then picked up for production by Columbia TriStar, who later dropped the movie because they felt the movie was too long, out of place and it was too low budgeted, before the producer Bender shipped it off to Miramax.The movie is depicted in a nonlinear tale also the narrative is presented out of sequence it is about three main characters. We have first a mob hit-man Vincent Vega (John Travolta) who was hired to kill Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis). Then we have a prizefighter Butch Coolidge, who double crossed a mobster by winning a bout that he took money for throwing. And the last main cast Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) is Vincent's partner who felt he has heard a calling from God to leave the hit-man life, when he was shot and the shooter misses.Each story is interwoven and intersects at various parts; if well put together the movie makes one whole complete picture.Before this, John Travolta was losing his edge in his movies and Willis was finding it hard to make a good movie after many big budget flops, after this flick they both got their edge back. For Financing Miramax (the films distributors) totally financed the film, and paid all the main actors the same per week wage regardless of their status.The movie was a huge financial success making over 200 million from its 8.5 million production and it was a good introduction to Tarantino's film style of nonlinear story arc.Pulp fiction is a nice addition to movies on your shelf; it won an Academy Award and a BAFTA award for Best Original Screenplay for both Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary. It also gave Samuel L. Jackson a BAFTA award for Best Supporting Actor.www.lagsreviews.com",8,0,2,20 December 2012
Jack Reacher," The movie is nice
","Jack Reacher's portrayal by Cruise is one some say is not up to the standard of the one Lee Child portrayed in his books. From my opinion even though I have not read any of the books, Cruise may not be as tall or as built as the Character in the books, but he did a fine job, because after I was done watching the movie I started to crave for the book.The movie may not be classic or anywhere near those of Cruise's Mission Impossible movies, but it is a good action movie that will keep you at the edge of your sit as you so desperately wait to see how Jack Reacher was going to figure out that James Barr (Joseph Sikora) was innocent and although he desperately doesn't want to help, his Sherlock Holmes like inquisitiveness got the better of him.The movie itself is based on one of the several Jack Reacher books by Child; this action thriller is an adaptation of Lee Child's Jack Reacher book titled One Shot which is the 9th book in the Jack Reacher series. It is an OK film to go see www.lagsreviews.com",6,1,5,18 January 2013
The Godfather: Part III," an okay ending to a wonderful trilogy
","The Godfather Part 3 to me should have been named 'the fall of Michael Corleone' reason being the movie centered on the fall of Michael himself, and how he gained it all but lost everything in the end. The movie is a nice addition to the classic two that came before it in 1972 and 74, but it does not give you the satisfaction of a classic like the others.Done 16 years after The Godfather part II (1974), this movie is popular for starring Sofia Coppola, whose father Francis Ford Coppola directed this and the first two prequels. Her performance was so captivatingly bad that it was difficult for you not to notice. The good thing is that you will probably be watching it on DVD so you can skip forward any scene she is in, because her presence in the movie and all her lines could have been deleted and the movie will still be good to watch.The movie stars Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, and Talia Shire who reprise their roles from the first two films as Michael, Kay and Connie. Robert Duvall however refuses to be in the movie due to a salary dispute.The movie plot takes off in 1979 like 20 years after the end of the second part, with Michael (Al Pacino) old and nearing retirement.His Children Anthony and Mary grew up with his wife after she got custody when she and Michael divorced. Tony his son did not want to have anything to do with his father's business, this withdrawal by Tony left a gap in the Corleone family and Michael had to mentor his brother's son Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia) for a role he would have preferably given to Tony. Vincent like his father Sonny was hot tempered and acted before thinking, this led to a dispute between him and Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna) who handles some of the Corleone family business interest.With Michael's life nearing an end he trains his new successor Vincent to take his place but Michael was not prepared for the tragic end to his era as the Godfather, an end that left him alone and with nothing.The movie was a commercial success, and received mixed reviews. It however didn't win any Academy awards unlike its predecessors who won the Academy Awards of Best Picture during their release and also other notable Academy Awards. This part III got seven nominations among which were Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Andy Garcia), Best Cinematography and others.Al Pacino did well in his acting in this movie but his performance was not as grand as the ones we witnessed in 1972 and 74 were Pacino got a nomination for Best Supporting Actor for The Godfather and nominated for Best Actor for The Godfather Part II.The Godfather trilogy is a nice collection for anyone to own and enjoy. Plans were being made to make a fourth part that will focus on Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia) reign as the Godfather and Don of the Corleone family, but such plans never materialized.www.lagsreviews.com",7,0,1,5 December 2012
The Matrix Reloaded," Just high tech visual effect nothing more
","The Matrix Reloaded was like the valley in high hills of The Matrix (1999). Done in 2003 the Wachowski brothers focused more on the graphics than the cast. Also the story just brought more questions than answers, making sure that at the end you will either want to see what is remaining of this series or you will not.The Matrix Reloaded is not so story oriented like the first, what drew many to the cinema to watch this movie (especially me) was the 'Burly Brawl' where Neo had to fight like 100 Agent Smiths. This brawl featured high tech visual effects, higher than the one used in the previous film. The 'Bullet Time' technology was set aside and virtual cameras were used to capture some of the effects and complex fight moves that we saw displayed in the 'Burly Brawl'.Now, these exceptionally high visual effects is what makes this movie standout from the rest and the complexity of the action scenes makes every action sequence and fight sequence worth seeing.The other part of the movie which included the story writing was a low from my view; the character development that we saw in the first is set aside here to focus more on the action scenes and the visual effects.The movie plot continues from where the first Matrix stopped, now that Neo (Keanu Reeves) realizes that he is 'The One' he has many things that he once knew and believed has changed, also changing was the believe of the people in Zion about him, many that doubted saw the things he can do and they too became believers of the prophesy.But many still doubted, now the machines are closing in on Zion and in The Matrix the source is losing control as the program Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) that Neo killed in the first film, has returned this time as a virus infecting other programs and taking over the matrix.Now Neo is faced with the sole fact, he must seek out the source and see if he can bring this war to an end and he must stop Agent Smith.The box office performance of this movie is higher than what the first movie in the franchise brought in. This movie also cost like 2 times more than the first and took home almost two times as much as the first movie did.As I said the story here is not the main drive for me when it comes to this movie, but the effect is exceptional, one that I'm sure you will not mind seeing, so after you have digested The Matrix (1999), you will not mind seeing this one The Matrix Reloaded.Fun fact from Wikipedia says: 'Around 97% of the materials from the sets of the film were recycled after production was completed; for example, tons of wood were sent to Mexico to build low-income housing.' www.lagsreviews.com",5,0,2,31 March 2013
Mystic River," Eastwood at his best
","Mystic River is a masterpiece, one which Clint Eastwood made sure that after watching you will feel messed up and elevated at the same time. The thing that catches you is the acting proficiency of the principal actors; they took their time to study their characters, with Tim Robbins to me, being the most effective of them all.Eastwood directorial prowess is showcased in this flick; he takes you on a Journey of social decadence, the pains of betrayal and the unlikely implication of child molestation. Mystic River was shot in Boston, and it is an adaptation of the 2001 novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane. The book and movie plot is about three boys who grow up as friends in Boston, Dave (Tim Robbins), Sean (Kevin Bacon), and Jimmy (Sean Penn). While the boys were playing around in the neighbourhood street Dave was abducted by child molesters who were pretending to be police officers. After days of regular molestation Dave escapes and finds his way back home, but the trauma of the molestation messed him up emotionally and mentally making him a little unstable and hard to understand.25 years in to the future Sean has grown to become a homicide detective, Jimmy is an ex-convict who currently runs a convenience store, and Dave has a blue collar job, still haunted by his abduction. Jimmy and Dave are related by marriage, with Dave marrying Jimmy's sister.Jimmy's daughter disappears one night and her body is found brutally murdered, coincidentally Dave comes home to his wife covered in blood and rattling that he fought off a mugger and 'bashed his head into the concrete', and possibly killed him. Sean is then assigned to investigate the murder, and the three childhood friends meet up again.Nominated for six Academy Awards, which Sean Penn won Best Actor and Tim Robbins won Best Supporting Actor (those where the two awards the movie went home with), making Mystic River the first film to win both awards since Ben-Hur in 1959.The movie also won two Golden Globe Awards for Sean Penn and Tim Robbins, in the Best Actor and Best supporting Actor category. With Penn and Robbins wining many more accolades from other not so notable awardees.Mystic River is a classic movie, that holds its own in the collation of greats, and it is one that I advice any movie lover to go buy this off the shelf. This is a DVD that you will like to tell others that you own.www.lagsreviews.com",8,1,1,17 December 2012
Die Hard," Just too wonderful
","Extremely thrilling and you will have your heart in your mouth most of the time, this 1988 classic action movie introduced a multi-million dollar franchise starring Bruce Willis as the lead, which as of today has spanned over 25 years with the latest addition to the movie franchise released in 2013 and titled A Good Day to Die Hard. This movie is wonderfully casted, superior in its story telling than most action movies in its time, and the villain Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman who played Sheriff Of Nottingham in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves in 1991 with Kevin Costner and Severus Snape in the Harry Potter Film series) was so out of it that it was amazing how he lost the fight.No better lone hero action movie has been able to stand the test of time like Die Hard has. This 1988 first in the film series was nominated for four Academy Awards including Best Sound Editing, Best Film Editing, Best Sound Mixing and Best Visual Effects. Bruce Willis character portrayal in this movie has been highly praised by many and he has carved a name for himself. As a young boy watching this franchise, me and my friends memorized John McClane's (Bruce Willis) catchphrase to use whenever, the phrase 'Yippee kai yay, motherfu@#er' was nominated as one of the best movie lines in the AFI's 100 Greatest Movie Lines.The movie plot and script is an adaptation based on 1979 Roderick Thorp bestselling novel Nothing Lasts Forever, about a New York City Police officer John McClane, who got in the middle of L.A. skyscraper heist, as he traveled to L.A. to go visit his family.The heist is led by Hans Gruber who under the guise of a terrorist attack took over the skyscraper so as to steal 640 million dollars in bonds. What Hans didn't plan was running into McClane who was in the same building and this man was ready to do anything possible including risking his life to stop Hans and his group. The sad part of this movie is the Deputy Chief of Police his portrayal in this movie is annoying and you have to over look him, which is easy since he had a few screen times.This movie was a commercial success making over 140 million based on a 28 million dollar budget and the screenplay is written by Steven E. de Souza (Commando (1985) and Die Harder (Die Hard 2 (1990)) and Jeb Stuart.To me this one of my very best Bruce Willis movie after Sixth Sense of cause, and I'm sure majority has already seen this, so I say go see it again.Also in this franchise are Die Hard 2 (1990), Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995), Live Free or Die Hard (2007) and A Good Day to Die Hard (2013).",8,1,2,2 March 2013

","They don't come any crazier than Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). This Psycho thriller was a classic horror movie in the 60s, with a score (soundtrack) that is breath taking.It also had four Academy Award nominations. Psycho is considered one of Hitchcock's best films, and it is ranked among the greatest films of all time.The movie is based on a novel of the same name by Robert Bloch which in turn was based loosely on the case of convicted Wisconsin murderer Ed Gein.Paramount felt the book was 'too repulsive' and 'impossible for films' and they did not like 'anything about it at all' and denied Hitchcock his usual budget. So, Hitchcock financed the film's creation through his own Shamley Productions.The movie was then shot in black and white to keep the budget below $ 1,000,000.The movie story is about a Secretary who embezzled $ 40,000 from her company, to go share with her boyfriend.On her way to their meeting place she stops over at a motel, owned by Norman Bates, who has been long under the control of his mother and is out of place in this world.The famous shower scene, which was the murder of Janet Leigh's character in the shower, is the film's pivotal scene and one of the best-known scenes in all of cinema history. As such, it spawned numerous myths and legends. It was shot from December 17 to December 23, 1959, and features 77 different camera angles. The scene 'runs 3 minutes and includes 50 cuts.Perkins did well and the whole movie actors were excellent in their portrayals, this gave the movie the edge that it had.I do hope you take the time to see this movie.",8,0,0,7 September 2012
When Harry Met Sally...," a movie to see always
","There is this nostalgic feeling you get when you are done watching this classic. I felt like I have forgotten how it feels to watch a romantic movie and actually be happy for those involve when they get together.Everyone needs a regular dose of 'When Harry met Sally' once in a while to make you smile with apparently no reason at all.Reiner said that he had always wanted to do a film about two people who become friends and do not have sex because they know it will ruin their relationship but have sex anyway. The movie itself is based on the very idea: can men and women be just platonic friends? Well to me from my experience the answer is NO! As long as there is constant communication, the man will want to sleep with her.The movie is known for its Deli scene where Sally claims that men cannot tell the difference between when a woman is having an orgasm or when she is faking it, and to prove her point, she vividly (but fully clothed) fakes one as other diners watch. Then the movie dropped its popular line, when a woman from the diner who had been watching Sally demonstrate the fake orgasm placed an order saying, 'I'll have what she's having.' The movie tells the story of two people Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) who met in 1977 in a car ride where they both discussed if it was possible for men and women to have a platonic friendship. Harry disagrees while Sally believed it was possible. They parted ways only to meet 5 years after in an airport. Harry asked Sally if they could be friends but Sally refused and then parted again to meet 5 years after that in a coffee shop.Then they became close friends helping each other out through the struggles and being there for each other.It all went well till the time came for them to answer the question, 'can a man and a woman be platonic friends without sex being involved?' The thing about the movie that keeps you going is the funny lines Billy Crystal delivers at every scene, add this to his acting and the persona of his character you have a guy that is fun to be with and fun to watch. Meg Ryan on the other hand plays a more subtle character who is more of amazement in the way she sees thing, that in fact there is never a dull moment with both characters.Rob Reiner directing in this Romantic Comedy is top notch, he went on to make Sleepless In Seattle (1993) which was also one of the best romantic movies ever made and it also stars Meg Ryan, but nothing can stand up to 'When Harry met Sally' This is my pick of best romantic movie I have seen till date.",8,1,1,4 September 2012
To Kill a Mockingbird," best court room drama
","Based on Harper Lee's novel of the same name, to kill a mockingbird is ranked the best courtroom by the American Film Institute (AFI), and the protagonist Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) is ranked number 1 in AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains.This drama will both inspire you and teach you, it makes you feel all the warmth you have missed over the years of CGI technology. Adding to this movie is the cast of children, whose plain naivety makes the movie a whole lot better.Set in the time where being black was a cause of concern. To kill a mockingbird tells the story of a man Atticus Finch and his kids during a 3 summer period. The story arc spans over 3 years about how Atticus kids Jem (Philip Alford) and Scout (Mary Badham) go through each summer with heartwarming adventures.Their story is wrapped round the case in which Atticus was defending a black man who is being held on rape charge.Guilty or not Atticus defends this man with all that he has in his kitty.The movies screenplay/script is something that you will be able to relate too, making the movie hit home in the first 10 minutes.Directing also was top notch as it all plays well.The script's lose end for me is the character Boo, who in some way I didn't get his full involvement in the movie as the director may have skipped some parts making us understand much of his liking to the kids.Phillip Alford did not initially want to audition for the part. However, when his mother informed him that he would miss a half day of school, he immediately decided to go after all.To say not to watch this movie is like telling you to skip breakfast.www.lagsreviews.com",8,0,1,13 October 2012
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," except for the endings this movie was almost perfect
","A tragedy drama that makes you look forward to what Jack is going to do next.I remember the feeling I had the first time I watched this movie over 10 years ago, the feeling was mutual watching it again in 2012.The movie is based on the 1962 novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey and it was shot at Oregon State Hospital in Salem, Oregon, which was also the setting of the novel.The director Milo Forman made sure that you get to feel a sort of attachment with the characters so you share their feelings of joy, sadness, remorse and loss at various times in the movie.The movie is blessed with some nice classic actors like Jack Nicholson, Brad Dourif, Christopher Lloyd and Danny DeVito just to mention a few.The movie focuses on the free spirited Randle P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) who is sent for evaluation at a mental hospital.Upon getting there Randle had an idea that he was to do time, not knowing that he was there till the doctors say he is free to go.He made friends with some of the patients in the institution like mama's boy Billy (Brad Dourif) and silent Native American Bromden (Will Sampson) who all thought was deaf and dumb and whom he called Chief.The psyche ward is handled by Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), who is seen more like the antagonist in this flick.McMurphy was an instigator of unruly behaviour from breaking him and his fellow patients out from the hospital to go on a boat trip and to a night party at the hospital which led to a tragedy.The movie did have a message, live free, be happy don't allow yourself to be tied down by anyone or anything or let either stand in the way of your happiness.Two of Milo Forman films, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and Amadeus (1984), both gained him an Academy Award for Best Director.The movie was the second to win all five major Academy Awards which were Best Picture, Best Actor in Lead Role, Best Actress in Lead Role, Best Director, and Best Screenplay, an accomplishment not repeated until 1991 by The Silence of the Lambs.The thing about the movie that gets to me most has always been the ending, tragedy never sits well with me sometimes especially in the case of this movie.Well if you haven't had a dose of this movie, then you need to.www.lagsreviews.com",9,2,3,13 October 2012
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Zeus was just all McClane needed to keep us glued
","This movie is exciting, fast and thrilling; it rides hard on the action leaving little room for story depth just straight forward action with unbelievable acting by the leads and the movie did not have any of the other main cast from the first two movies, regardless this movie is just a wonderful action movie that we all should get the thrill of seeing. This is one wonderful Die Hard addition, as our hero is paired with another great actor Samuel L. Jackson as McClane goes up against a vengeful terrorist, who is here for one reason payback as McClane took down his brother in the first Die Hard movie but payback was just part of the check list also making out with over 140 billion in gold from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was also part of that list.The movie starts with a big explosion, and unlike the first two McClane was in full control of what was going on, a twist from the previous 2 films and a welcome twist if I can say so myself. The second Die Hard movie (Die Hard 2: Die Harder) ended with McClane and Holly walking off happy, this starts with McClane all washed up from a split from his wife.I love this movie, and Simon says, 'Everyone should go see this' because to me this movie was better than the second in the franchise.www.lagsreviews.com",7,0,0,2 March 2013
Ice Age: Continental Drift," it was fun, but not the best of the series
","Ice Age: Continental Drift is funny, and i had fun watching it and looked forward to seeing what this weird herd is up to now.It is the fourth installment of the Ice Age series and the seventh CG production of Blue Sky Studios and the first sequel not to be directed by Carlos Saldanha who will be directing RIO part 2.What I love must about this flick is the introduction of a partner for Diego; a white tiger lady is added ladies and gentlemen. The movie also has the whole fun of the old clichés, which I seem not to be tired of seeing. It also showcases cool CG effect; I loved the water effect most.The plot was educational (as long as you know it is bogus) due to Scrat's (Squirrel) hunt for acorns he triggers the break-up of the world continent into the continents as we know them today, which cause Manny to lose his family.Manny, Diego, and Sid embark upon another adventure to find his family, after their continent is set adrift. Using an iceberg as a ship, they encounter sea creatures and battle pirates as they explore a new world, and learn why it is good to be part of a family herd, than being part of a group where one person leads and other follow.Well, the new directors weren't that bad, as the movie did have some fun screenplays and events that you will be thrilled to see. As we watch this creatures move from the Ice Age to the present age the pictures tell stories that are kinda informative and entertaining.Hey! I must have missed that geography class when they taught that Scrat the squirrel created the whole world.Although this is not the best addition to the Ice Age series it was fun to watch. And the movie kinda opens doors to new additional sequels.But I hope Blue Sky won't bother making any more.",6,31,40,6 July 2012
The Green Mile," a wonderful movie adaptation
","The Green Mile is based on a 1996 Stephen King novel of the same name. Done three years after the book release, the Green Mile was nominated for four Academy Awards, which included Best Supporting Actor for Michael Clarke Duncan, Best Picture, Best Sound, and Best Adapted Screenplay.The movie was directed by Frank Darabont who also developed the screenplay of the movie under an eight week period, an adapted screenplay that i have to commend as one of the best i have seen, but it lost in the Oscars to the movie The Cider House Rules. Frank Darabont was also in charge of directing the critical acclaim The Shawshank Redemption which also earned him a nomination of best Adapted screenplay in 1994.The high point of this movie will be the whole movie itself; i happen to have read the book before seeing the movie so watching a well adapted novel on the silver screen made me feel like i was reading the book all over again.The movie plot and the story itself are based on a flashback of a tale Paul Edgecomb was telling an old friend about his time as a corrections officer in charge of death row inmates in the Cold Mountain Penitentiary in 1935.The cell block Paul (Tom Hanks) worked in was called the 'Green Mile' because the condemned prisoners walking to their execution are said to be walking 'the last mile'. Here, it is a stretch of faded lime-green linoleum. The other guards which were Paul's friends in the movie were Brutus 'Brutal' Howell (David Morse), Harry Terwilliger (Jeffery DeMunn), and Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper).In addition to the guards was Percy (Doug Hutchison) an arrogant misfit who took pride in terrorising the inmates.Everything in the cell block was as usual until the guards got a visit from two inmates who changed their very view of life itself.One of the inmates that visited was John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) a giant of a man who had some weird miraculous power ability to heal and feel the pain and sufferings of others and the other was 'Wild Bill' Wharton (Sam Rockwell) who was a psycho, murderer and paedophile.Their arrival was plagued with chaos miraculous healings and with the addition of Percy it became a handful for the other guards.The Green Mile is a movie i have seen over and over again, and i believe you will enjoy watching it too.www.lagsreviews.com",7,2,3,25 October 2012
Jaws," every other is a felony
","Every shark movie after this (except for Deep Blue Sea) is a felony.Wow! Talk about captivating, Spielberg was at the top of his game here with this movie that cost $9 million dollars and made over $470 million dollars. It was also responsible for introducing the idea of summer block buster releases as the movie was shown in over 450 screens, accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign.The movie is based on a novel of the same name by Peter Benchley, but Spielberg focused on the main theme 'the shark' removing all the other subplots. Shot mostly on location on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, the film had a troubled production, mostly due to the mechanical shark's malfunctions, it also overran its budget and ran past its schedule, and some of these reasons are why some believe Spielberg opted out of being involved in Jaws 2.The movie plot was thus: During the summer break some teens were having a night party on fictional Atlantic resort Amity Island. One of the girls went skinny dipping while her friends continue to party on the beach. While waiting for a boy to come join her she got pulled under by something that leaves only you the view with the idea that death came.When pieces of her body washed ashore, the Police Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) feared that it was a shark attack and wanted to close the beach for the town's safety, but Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) disagreed.His point being, the town's people survived mainly on tourist trade and the July 4th holiday was also approaching so he refused to close the beach.He soon changed his mind after a boy and a man also died due to shark attack. He then decided to hire Quint (Robert Shaw), the only local fisherman willing to take on a Great White.The movie score is something that will stick with you and it resembled that used by classic thriller director Alfred Hitchcock. To overcome some of the difficulties encountered Spielberg mostly used an ominous, minimalistic theme created by composer John Williams to indicate the shark's impending appearances.Jaws have had three sequels, none with the participation of Spielberg or Benchley.Jaws also won three Academy Awards for Best Film Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, and Best Sound. It was also nominated for Best Picture but lost it to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (which starred Jack Nicolson).www.lagsreviews.com",8,4,9,13 October 2012
Dark Shadows," What a waste of time
","The decision to watch Dark Shadows was not based on the fact that it starred Johnny Depp, although this is a reason for some to go to the cinemas. Now the presence of Michelle Pfeiffer (Who played Catwoman and to me is the best portrayal till date) was as incentive but the main reason I actually opted to see this was because it was done by Tim Burton.Tim Burton is known for his Gothic movies and this is no exception, one of my favourite Tim Burton movie is still The Nightmare Before Christmas. Other greats by Tim Burton are Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, Batman (1989), Batman Returns (1992) and my all time favourite Beetlejuice (I have a lot of Tim Burton favourites).Well enough of Tim let's get talking about Dark Shadows, the movie is based on a soap opera of the same name that premiered on ABC between 1966 and 1971. Funny although Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is the main character in this movie in the soap he was introduced in the second season and grew to become one of the main character.I haven't seen any of the episodes in the series but if the movie is anything like the series then I wonder...This is the Eight (if am not mistaken) movie that Johnny Depp and Tim Burton have made together and it is one of the worst I have seen from both.The main issue about the movie isn't the theme, the theme is actually well crafted and I give kudos to the customer designer and the set manager, but the movie is so unevenly paced one time you are excited then next you are dragged into a long conversation.The Vampire has some tricks up its sleeves other than the fact that he could make you his zombie (which he did enough times in the movie), he could also bore you to death (which he did throughout the movie).The story goes thus: In the 18th century the Collins built a huge fortune in the fishing industry in Maine. A witch (Eva Green) falls in love with Barnabas (Johnny Depp) the son of Mr. Collins, but he turned her down after some..She out of anger and jealousy kills everything Barnabas loves, including his parents his wife and she did the one thing that witches have not been able to do for a while now, she transforms him into a vampire and had him buried alive. (Witches turning men into vampires, where have I heard that before? Oh! yeah no where) We are now in the 70s and Barnabas is dug out. He reunites with his weird descendants and begins plotting his return to power. Also in these 196 years in the ground the witch still was alive.Will I still watch another Tim Burton movie? Hell yeah! Alice in Wonderland (which he did with Johnny Depp) is still the eleventh highest grossing, movie in the world, so Tim has got it in him to make a masterpiece just that this movie is 3 stars from being one.If we point our focus on Depp and rest of the crew, it was a share waste of talent. Having Pfeiffer and Eva Green and making no good use of them is amazing. Depp's movie before this was The Rum Diary a movie I still don't get.All in all I won't waste a dime on this movie this I tell you.",5,7,12,23 May 2012
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," It was actually nice
","George Lucas took advantage of the mastery display of CGI sword play which was the only good thing about Attack of the Clones, as we get to see Master Yoda will the lightsaber again this time take on the Sith Lord and let's not forget the wonderful introduction of Darth Vader, Revenge of the Sith is the best of the new Star Wars trilogy. The thing I did enjoy most in the movie is the pace it moved, it was all happening fast from the dissolving of the Republic, the corruption of Anakin and then Lucas made we the viewers eager to see the faceoff between the Mentor and apprentice, as we wait to see Obi-Wan Kenobi take on young, proud and powerful Anakin Skywalker.Lucas did the writing by himself, unlike the previous Attack of the Clones where he hired some others to help make a better star wars movie than The Phantom Menace, which brought about more theory than action, this movie is more about the force, and the corruption of power. The movie's lightsaber fight scenes were intense, Obi-Wan's battle with General Grievous (Grievous is a fearsome looking cyborg who seemed to be having some health issues. He is the General of the Separatists' droid army) was just fun to watch as Obi-Wan had to take on the four armed lightsaber (with each arm armed with a lightsaber) fighting cyborg. There were also many impressive lightsaber fight scenes. The ending battle between Obi-Wan and Anakin was very impressive when you look at the speed they moved and the complexity of their strikes and paring. It was even more impressive when I found out that neither Ewan McGregor nor Hayden Christensen used a stunt double in any of the lightsaber battles.The events that occurred in this movie happened three years after the Clone Wars, with the Jedi Knights on a massive mission which had them all spread across the galaxy with the clone army as the waged war against the Separatists. Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi was sent to deal with General Grievous, leader of the Separatist Army while Anakin Skywalker had some time alone to grow closer to Palpatine, the Chancellor of the Galactic Republic (The Sith Lord).During their discussions Anakin is told about the dark side and its advantages by the Sith Lord, Palpatine. Anakin at first tried to disapprove but soon succumbs to the temptations of the dark side of the Force and becomes Darth Vader.Here is a Star Wars prequel that can stand beside the original trilogy that Lucas did in the 70s and 80s.www.lagsreviews.com",6,1,3,3 February 2013
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," it stars a witch other witches wanna be like
","Disney's first full length animated feature is just masterful, the thing is, it is so good that it is very hard to believe that this is the first, the one that began the Lion King, Aladdin, Beauty and The Beast Tarzan and more. The movie boasts of a score that you will love and come to respect. Disney's beginning was so good that you just have to dip your hat to the dream of Walt Disney himself. It features the depth of imagination from the Disney crew that has long be welcomed and has been their trademark for years, nothing beats the names of the seven dwarfs and their characters. Before Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the Disney studio had been producing animated short subjects in the Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies series. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was to be the first full length cel animated feature in motion picture history, and to be able to keep up with the high production cost of over 1 million dollars which is considerably high for any movie at all in 1937, Disney had to mortgage his house.The plot foundation is taken from the Grimm stories of Snow White, and Disney's seven dwarfs twist is what stands in the memory most as the story of Snow White.Disney's gamble at that time was seen as foolishness, with many trying to talk him out of it, but after the movie was done and the first viewing was over, not only did Disney get a 10 minutes standing ovation, he also received a full size Oscar statuette and seven miniature ones for his work, this was presented to him by 10 year old child star actress Shirley Temple.It has also received many other notable recognition in its time, it is listed as the 34th greatest movie of all time in the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) and it is listed in their AFI's 10 Top 10 animated Film, as the number 1 Animated film of all time. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs provided enough revenue for Disney to build his studio, and also provided enough for them to make another two animations, Pinocchio and Fantasia. Snow White is the first of its kind, and the great thing about it is that it is not just a celebrated mediocre of an attempt at something different, the movie is a good animation, one you will most enjoy. www.lagsreviews.com",8,3,3,27 December 2012
The Lion King," No worries this is a classic
","Hakuna Matata, the catchphrase that this movie made many say for years, the movie is full of action and fun, that has made it one of the best 2D animation one could see, the movie dialogue is also intriguing and funny, the movie which seems to be in three parts, the first being Simba's life in Pride rock, his life with Timon and Pumbaa where he loses some of his Lion instincts and the last part where he goes back to Pride rock to reclaim his throne. The Lion King was the first Disney animated feature to be a total original story, all other animations before it have been based on an already existing work. The idea of the movie was conceived during the promotion of Oliver & Company, the idea was basic: a story about animals that will be set in Africa. The filmmakers, then went ahead to build the story taking ideas from the lives of Joseph and Moses (from the Bible) and William Shakespeare's Hamlet.The movie production began during the time of the production of Pocahontas, many of the animators and directors at Disney felt that not many people will want to sit and watch a little Lion cub who is framed for murder (murder of his father) by his uncle, for that reason alone many of the animators wanted to work on Pocahontas instead, but to their surprise although both were financially successful, Lion King made more money (it has become the highest grossing 2D animation ever) and received more positive reviews.The voice casting for Lion King, was full of stars from Matthew Broderick, Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Rowan Atkinson, Whoopi Goldberg (just to mention a few) and even Disney's long time voice artist Jim Cummings was also available in this unending list of star voice actors.The movie plot of Lion king is about a lion cub named Simba who gets framed for murdering his father (Mufasa voiced by James Earl Jones) by his uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons). Simba runs away from his right as heir to the throne and meets and befriends a meerkat, Timon (Nathan Lane) and a warthog Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella). Things were going well but the past that Simba ran from found him where he was hiding and now Simba (Matthew Broderick) has to go back to Pride Rock to face his past.Lion King is a nice animation to own and watch again. Two home video sequels were done of the movie, The Lion King 2 (not worth watching at all) and The Lion King 11/2 (good enough to be seen), and a series about Timon and Pumbaa was also done, which was amusing.www.lagsreviews.com",8,2,2,27 December 2012
WALL·E," addressing our probable outcome
","WALL-E is just a sweet movie, which deals on the loneliness and determination of a singular robot that developed sentience while watching videos of human interaction and listening to music. WALL-E was the only one of his kind left on Earth and he kept at his job even though others like him have been unable to keep up and have become rust and parts for WALL-E to use to carry his singular assignment as a cleaner of the earth, along with him is a friend, a cockroach which WALL-E adores.WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter – Earth Class) developed a romantic endeavor with another robot named EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator), a romance that Andrew Stanton (a Christian) the writer/director came up with, as he viewed WALL-E's loneliness like that of Adam in the Bible and how God gave him Eve as a companion, so the name of WALL-E's companion was named EVE in reference to the Eve in the Bible.With Stanton wanting WALL-E as a box with no mouth or nose and EVE as an egg with no mouth or nose the animators watched a series of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin movies for almost a year to be able to learn how to create emotions silently.WALL-E's plot is about a singular robot that in 2805 was still cleaning the earth after the humans were evacuated in 2105 to starliners. As the Earth was becoming a waste land humans had to be taken out of it so that it can be cleaned so when all human were gone, left behind were trash compactor Waste Allocation Load Lifter – Earth Class (WALL-E) robots, to clean the Earth but as the years passed all other robots broke down leaving except one, so this singular WALL-E robot carried on with the earth cleaning task.One day a beautiful robot named EVE came to Earth, and WALL-E fell for her; although she was a hard nut to crack, WALL-E triumphed but when her task was trying to set them apart, WALL-E followed her to a starliner where humans were, there we come across other plots and subplots concerning the humans if there are to go back to earth or not.WALL-E deals with a lot of major issues that we are either facing or going to face in the nearest future, the problem of waste management, laziness, obesity, consumerism and environmental problems that the world will be facing if we don't sit up.WALL-E won numerous accolades, including an Oscar for Best Animated feature, it was also ranked number movie in the 2010 Times magazine movie of the decade. It currently holds a 96% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 8.5/10. It was also a commercial success.WALL-E is one of those movies, which just stick with you, the nostalgia feeling it delivers, the innocence of love, and the determination of a singular robot, WALL-E is a movie that will always stand as one of the best Disney/Pixar has to offer.www.lagsreviews.com",8,1,2,25 December 2012
The Shawshank Redemption," Now here is a classic
","This suspense filled, dramatic movie rides high on the plain of self discovery, self worth and self preservation; if an innocent man is locked up for two decades with criminals, nothing else will he learn than to be a criminal himself. There is no better movie that I can recommend you to see than this classic Jail Break that stared one of the best supporting actors you will love to have on your side if you are in the lead role of a movie, Morgan Freeman.Shawshank Redemption was adapted from a Stephen King novella named Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Frank Darabont secured the right to make the film from King in 1987, and he worked intensively on the screenplay for a proper adaptation of the movie, Darabont's screenplay writing earned him an Academy Award nomination, in fact the movie had seven Academy Award nominations and won none.The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is a banker who got convicted for murdering his wife and her lover; he got two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. At Shawshank Andy befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman) Red was a contraband smuggler.Andy also developed a nice rapport with the warden and the other guards helping them with their taxes and also helping the warden in his money laundering operation.The movie boast of amazing scenery not to add an impressive cinematography, the movie growth and inclusion and exit of characters will make you feel like you are reading a book, the movie has numerous cast, and it is broken into segments each introducing new casts and each building a parallel wall that guides us to the climatic end.It didn't do well in the box office at all barely making back its production cost, but due to critic's high rating and Academy Award nomination, Golden Globe award nomination and other notable nominations, the movie did well in rental and DVD sales, it is shown regularly on Cable TV, and it has a high following.Frank Darabont who is the director and screenplay writer also made more of King's books; He directed the 1999 Tom Hanks movie The Green Mile which was a box office success compared to this. The Green Mile is another of King's books that is about a prison, and Darabont also directed the 2007 movie The Mist which is also based on a Stephen King book.Here is a DVD every home should have.www.lagsreviews.com",9,3,4,17 December 2012
Prometheus," A good movie to see with a bowl of popcorn at your side
","This was meant to be the fifth entry in the Alien franchise, but was later set as a standalone film. Prometheus is a fun filled, action packed sci-fi thriller that will keep you at the edge of your sit. As the movie unfolds from a gentle thrilling experience to a rampaging killing frenzy that boiled down to a survival race, you the viewer will be kept captivated longing to see what's next.Scott planned to make a prequel to Alien which he did in 1979, but the idea was later set aside as Fox had done a crossover between Alien and Predator in 2004 titled Alien vs. Predator as this movie already showed the begin of Alien.Fox still went ahead with Scott to make this movie, but it will be parallel to the Alien movie, Scott stated that 'while Alien was indeed the jumping-off point for this project, out of the creative process evolved a new, grand mythology and universe in which this original story takes place the ideas tackled in this film are unique, large and provocative.' The high note in Prometheus was Noomi Rapace, her acting and actions were well received by I the viewer, and the way she played the role of what I will call, the modern day Ripley was something to see. There were many intense scenes where I respected hey portrayal of the character. This is also a credit to the director as Scott was able to bring out the best in her so as to make her live up to the shadow casted by Sigourney Weaver as the female lead in an Alien world.Set in the 21st Century, couple Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway discovers a star map among the remnants of several ancient Earth civilizations; they interpret it to be an invitation from humanity's forerunners. The couple with a crew went onboard the spaceship named 'Prometheus' to follow the star map discovered.This Led to a distant world and an advanced civilization, the crew seeks the origins of humanity, but instead discovers a threat that could cause the extinction of the human race.Shooting began in 2010, and went on longer than planned, the movie shows Ridley Scott at his best with scenes and the story well depicted that all times you are not lost. The cast had a task on their hand, a task in which they lived up to. The cinematography and lighting are just exquisite and the sound is well suited to the movie itself, giving you an all round feel of what a good movie should be.The movie had its twist and turns that made it more captivating and some you won't even expect.Noomi Rapace is best known for her role as Lisbeth Salander in the Swedish/Danish film adaptations of the Millennium series: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2009), The Girl Who Played with Fire and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest. Also to watch out for is Michael Fassbender who plays David (an android) in this movie and was a key feature in the movie itself. Michael Fassbender also played Magneto in the superhero film X-Men: First Class (2011).This is a fine movie one you will enjoy with a bowl of popcorn at your side.",7,1,3,8 June 2012

","Well Raging bull is a movie that drags and after a while picks up and then drags on till it ends, this movie to me does not leave up to the classic rating it gets.It tells the story of Jake LaMotta an Italian American Boxer; it is based on his (LaMotta) book Raging Bull: My Story. Robert De Niro portrays LaMotta a sadistic and jealous individual.De Niro came across the story during the shooting of God father II, he showed it to Scorsese hoping he would make the movie, but Scorsese turned it down and after nearly dying from a drug overdose, Scorsese agreed to make the film for De Niro's sake, not only to save his own life but also to save what remained of his career.After the script was made, both Scorsese and De Niro spent two and a half weeks on the island of Saint Martin, extensively re-building the content of the film changing what needed to be changed and adding what was missing.The film was then made with a plot that shows how LaMotta rose to the top with the aid of his manager, and then due to his anger issues and jealous rage threw it all away and fell back to point zero.The photography was nice; shooting in black and white didn't stop the movie from passing across its message. The movie helped launched Joe Pesci's career as the acting in the movie by all that were involved is an A+.Locations used in the movie, well the set that was used will make you think you were in the 50s, as the set were well designed. Cinematography in the ring during the fights is something I did enjoy, as the camera got all angles and the blood flying too was well worked into it.The other sad thing about this movie other than the length is the fight choreography, you can see at times that the punches were not landing and they were faked.This is one of the eight movies that De Niro and Scorsese made together and not one of their best as Goodfellas still remain their best.Not to put a damper on the mood here, but to me Raging Bull is a nice watch once and that is that.",6,1,6,4 September 2012
Taken 2," Seen it all before
","He does the same thing all over again; the only difference is he was taken and yet the movie is a box office hit.Every action movie fan knows this lines 'I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you're looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills' and then add the whole jumping, killing, electrocuting and biting up bad guys Taken (2008) was born.I wanted to be Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) this guy to me is better than Jason Borne but the producers of this movie must have been on something to have thought Taken 2 will be exceptional. A movie that deals you no surprises from the very get go is a movie I rather not see.The movie relied so much on the idea, 'Hey! It is me again, the guy from Taken 1'. The French duo of Olivier Megaton and Luc Besson who made the movie Columbiana in 2011, came together to deliver a movie that had an exceptional part one but a disappointing part two.Taken 2 did have its own story; Bryan Mills goes to Istanbul, his ex and daughter join him and they were having a nice get away.Now the guys that Bryan killed in part one, well one of them, the parent actually didn't get the memo, or didn't bother going to cinemas 4 years ago to see the movie of how his son was killed, so he decided to take revenge and take Bryan and Ex-wife (Jean Grey, Famke Janssen).Bad guys always make the mistake of leaving the hero alive long enough for him to think up an escape plan, this guys weren't different, instead of shooting him when they had the chance, they wanted him to suffer, the repercussion of that was known of them will be alive to tell the tale to the other fools who decides to come after Bryan in Taken 3, if the producers decide to go that far.So Bryan and wife get taken, daughter helps dad escape and dad kills everybody.One thing you have to give taken 2 though is that it was fast, I like fast paced action movie they make you smile.Well if you have the chance go see this movie, but wait till the ticket price drops.www.lagsreviews.com",5,0,3,9 October 2012
The Silence of the Lambs," here is a movie you can watch again and again
","With a screen time of not more than 17 minutes, Anthony Hopkins pulled off a memorable performance that gained him an Academy Award; I think no actor has won an Oscar for such a short screen time. His was so great that even in this short screen time he puts the fear of his cannibalism in you that he also earned the title of the 1 Villain of all time in the AFI (American Film Institute) 100 Years... 100 Heroes & Villain for his portrayal of Dr. Hannibal Lecter in this movie.There is just so much about this movie that just makes you love it, the high intellect showed by Lecter, the way he master minds the people he is talking to making them bend to his will in such a way that they have no idea, and how he can draw you in for just a bite of your nose. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.Silence of the Lambs is one of three movies to win all five major Oscar awards, those awards are: Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Actor, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. The other two films to achieve such are It happened One Night in 1934 and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in 1975.The movie plot is about a young FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), who seeks the advice of the imprisoned Dr. Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to apprehend another serial killer, known only as 'Buffalo Bill'.Clarice was sent to Hannibal Lecter with the hope of gaining a better insight into the mind of the serial killer Buffalo Bill, by talking to another psychopath (Lecter). Dr. Lecter used to be a psychiatrist, until he turned psycho. He has a powerful mind and he is an excellent mind manipulator.This 1991 classic is based on the 1988 novel of the same name by Thomas Harris, his second to feature Hannibal Lecter. His first book in 1981 Red Dragon was where Lecter was first introduced as a brilliant psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer. Red Dragon was the first film adapted from the Harris novels and it was done in 1986 and named Manhunter it starred Brian Cox as Lecter, spelled 'Lecktor'.A remake of Red Dragon was done in 2002 starring Hopkins as Lector and the movie was adapted from the same novel as Manhunter, released to a generally positive review Red Dragon was a critical and box office success, making over $200 million on a $78 million budget.This movie (Silence of the Lambs) was a box office success and it is one you will one to watch, but warning it does deal with cannibalism and it is graphical in some sense.www.lagsreviews.com",9,2,3,20 December 2012
X-Men: First Class," First I will like to say the posters don't do justice to this film.
","First I will like to say the posters don't do justice to this film. This movie is a movie you will like to see again, the plot is almost nearing excellence, and the action scenes are well choreographed. The effects are a grade A, and the dialogue is interesting. The movie is well directed by Vaughn, who keeps the movie dramatic, and thrilling.The movie starts is a NAZI concentration camp in 1944, where we see Erik Lehnsherr who is being forced to display his mutant power, when he's separated from his mother. This act of force was carried out by a doctor Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) who wants to study and harness Erik's abilities.In New York, a wealthy boy, Charles Xavier, who can read minds, meets a girl named Raven who can shape-shift but whose natural physical state is blue and scaly.In 1962, Charles has grown and has become a compassionate genetic scientist (now played by James McAvoy) studying genetic abnormalities. Erik on the other hand has grown (now played by Michael Fassbender) was obsessed with revenge and tracking down the doctor who tortured him. Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) to have grown to be a frustrated mutant as she longed envision life without her mutation.We get to see how Hank (Beast) developed a serum to hide their differences from the human world go bad, and they added a relationship though quite small between Hank and Raven. The movie's chief focus was on the beginning of it all, we get to see how close Charles Xavier and Magneto was and how their differences drove both party apart. As we get to see this two heroes be for each other and then at the very end when the choice of either be for the humans or for the mutants started the now called X-MEN. Casting, in this movie is just the thing that gives this movie the edge it needed, as Kevin Beacon (long time no see) was just wonderful, giving us a memorable performance. The other teens in the movie, Havoc, Darwin etc also did their part as we see them struggle with their mastery of their powers.So in the end of this review, marvel did something a lot better than what the last 2 films had done. It not a movie you will regret but one you will love.",7,0,1,11 June 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Not the best i have seen this year
","A lot of people say this is the best movie they have seen this year so far. I just wonder why.This year so far The Avengers still remains to be beaten. The movie Dark Knight Rises is not bad at all there was just something about the movie that just didn't click for me. Just like I went to see the avengers (staying away from previews and write ups about it so as to be surprised by the events) so did I for Dark Knight Rises. In the case of Avengers I was swept of my feet, while here I just sat still.Nolan only agreed to a third film on the basis of finding a worthwhile story, fearing that he would become bored halfway through production if he discovered the film to be unnecessary. He later came up with a story with the aid of his brother.The studio after seeing the success of Joker in The Dark Knight, wanted to have the Riddler as the villain but Nolan went for Bane instead. The thing that will trip you about this movie is Selina Kyle; Catwoman (Anne Hathaway) was well delivered and captured my very eye. The character is very similar to that of the comics and was SEXY. But on the argument on whether Michelle Pfeiffer or Anne Hathaway delivered the best version of the Cat, well looking at how the stories were written Pfeiffer has the upper hand due to the fact that the Batman Returns (1992) focused on her somewhat, while here she was just a character. But if that is set aside I will pick Michelle's adaptation for the whole psycho fun she put into it.The plot of the movie goes: It has been eight years since Batman vanished into the night, turning, in that instant, from hero to fugitive. Assuming the blame for the death of D.A. Harvey Dent, the crime rate in Gotham has also dropped massively. The plan between the Bat and commissioner Gordon was going well till a terrorist group and their leader comes into Gotham.The raid of the group opens wounds, and tears a father son relationship that Bruce had. The terrorist Bane was not the only one bring in the blues in to Wayne's life, a mysterious thief known as Selina Kyle too was roaming the street.A series of unfortunate events leads to the comic history between the Bat, Bane and where Bane broke the Bats back. Now the Bat is out of commission and Gotham is at its knees, Who will save them? We all know the answer, The Bat.As acting, goes Bale did well, but Anne Hathaway stole the show. The directing is not flawed at all Nolan is a master movie maker and all respect must be given to him. But the story to me was as weak as bread on water, and the movie was just too long for me.Will I be seeing this movie again? Not really. But I dare you to miss this flick, regardless of what anyone says it is a movie to see.",6,2,7,30 July 2012
The Croods," A miss fire from my view
","The Croods can be said to have come out a little crude, I felt it was too rough around the edges and the Midas touch of Chris Sanders (which showed up in Lilo & Stich (2002) and he is the man behind the Bolt (2008) story before he left Disney and joined Dreamworks to make the masterpiece How To Train Your Dragon (2010), which he will also be involved in the later sequels of it) is losing its touch after all.It is not that The Croods didn't have the family fun package because it did and it also had the whole family warmth that I expected from an animation targeted at young audience, but the movie was just too primitive, they went overboard with the whole caveman idea, I actually got tired of the stone age, something The Flintstones have not been able to achieve. The movie has many fast paced scenes, a lot of action (adventure) to make you sit up and not be bored, but at the end, it felt weak in the area of emotional sentiment something Pixar has mastered, which makes the characters memorable. The CGI was OK, but the movie also showed lack in the area of the character development, I actually didn't see any reason to like anybody I saw on the screen.The plot is about change and people's failure to accept it. The Croods are a caveman family that has managed to survive the harsh conditions that they live in, only because they believe that to be curious or to desire change is to desire death. But things changed when another Stone Age man passes by their cave, he is more advanced than they are and he knows how to make fire. Now The Croods have a problem, this man tells them it is time to move because where they are, is going to be gone soon as climatic changes are affecting the earth's crust. But The Croods don't want to move, except for one, she happens to have developed feelings for the young genius and propels the family to follow him.The Croods is the first animation film from DreamWorks Animation to be distributed by 20th Century Fox, since the end of their distribution deal with Paramount Pictures in 2012 with Rise of the Guardians.My take on this movie is that, it could have been better but it isn't. The Croods is a family movie nothing more or spectacular I don't see this having an Oscar nomination.www.lagsreviews.com",5,2,9,31 March 2013
Bruce Almighty," fun
","What if you had the role of God, do you think you would have done a better job?Bruce Almighty may not be a critic favorite, with a weak CGI, a not too perfect script and many loose ends but it is one funny movie. The wonderful chemistry, between Jim Carrey and Jennifer Aniston made them a beautiful on-screen couple trying to cope with the things life dishes out at you. And my favorite line in the movie came from when Bruce was trying to stop Grace (Jennifer Aniston) from leaving him: Bruce: You can't leave me, I'm the Alpha baby, I'm the Omega lady.Bruce Almighty is a slap stick comedy, something that Carrey fits just easily, the movie is funny and the ideas that the writers brought to the screen to show the height of selfishness in the heart of a man who had power, was something that I found to be true.One of the ideas that can be said to have taken from Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life (1946), is when Bruce actually lassoed the moon, something George Bailey said he was willing to do for Mary, in the scene (in the movie it's a wonderful life) where both walked home singing buffalo girl.Directed by Tom Shadyac, whose first directorial film was also with Jim Carrey in the Ace Ventura series, which is the only movie that Jim Carrey did a part two of.The movie revolves around Bruce (Jim Carrey) who complains about how God is not being fair to him, so one day he gets a visit from the Almighty God (Morgan Freeman), who gives Bruce his powers to do as he pleases.But things turn from sweet to sour when Bruce learns a hard lesson, that being God is not just as easy as he thought.Although highly criticized the movie has a huge cult following, (I included as I have seen this movie countless times) in the box office it made over 480 million dollars (its production cost was 81 million) in its theatrical run, no matter what the critics say you just want to see what Bruce did with God's power.A sequel Evan Almighty was done in 2007 with Jim Carrey refusing to reprise his role as he doesn't like playing the same role twice, the movie did have Morgan Freeman reprise his role as God and this time the center character was Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), the antagonist of the first film. Evan Almighty was a financial blunder, not recouping its production cost in the box office. I have seen it and I can just advice that you just stay away from it.Bruce Almighty is funny and fun, although not much of a family fun but you will like it.www.lagsreviews.com",7,0,0,21 December 2012
Ben-Hur," The word is EPIC...
","When the movie was over and in the last scene I saw Ben-Hur Judah (Charlton Heston) approach his mother and sister after he beheld the miracle of our Lord Jesus Christ, I said within myself, 'what a privilege it is to have seen this movie'; and a privilege it was indeed. The most amazing thing about the movie is the score, it is just wonderful, then add the tale of Ben-Hur who went from being a prince to a slave and back and learnt the hard way that revenge does not bring content; What you have is this 50s masterpiece that all should get the privilege to see.The story of Ben-Hur is set during the birth and death of Christ, Ben-Hur at that time was a good friend of the next in line Governor of Jerusalem. Their friendship is tested (as Ben-Hur is a Jew and his best friend Messala (next in line Governor) is Roman) when Messala calls Ben aside and ask for the names of the Jews leading a rebellion against Rome, Ben's refusal caused both friends to part.An unfortunate incident about a loose tile led to the death of the present Governor, Ben and his sister were the ones responsible for the accident, but Messala failed to accept the incident for what it was, an accident even after his investigation showed it was so.Messala, out of revenge for Ben turning him down, had Ben sold to slavery and his family jailed. Something led to another and Ben is free and all he wants is revenge.Ben Hur was a record breaking Oscar movie, it won 11 out of the 12 Academy Award nominations that it got, some of its wins inclue Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor for Charlton Heston. Charlton's 1956 movie, The Ten Commandment was also a hit and showed Charlton's gift in epic film portrayal. Ben Hur is based on a book named Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ by Lew Wallace, and the movie production saw the use of wonderful cinematic scenes, shots that will linger such as the one of the chariot race.Ben-Hur was both a critical and a commercial success making close to 10 times its production cost and the movie is regarded as one of the best epic movies ever made. Holding back ratings in the American Film Institute in their top 100 movies (it is ranked a 100) and Top Epic films (here it is ranked number 2).Ben-Hur is a beautiful movie and a highly successful one, which many should get the chance to see; the movie like The Ten Commandments is biblical but not totally biblically grounded like Ten Commandments, but it is still wonderful and nice to see even for those who are eager to see a biblical film.www.lagsreviews.com",7,0,2,5 March 2013
Toy Story 3," Nice follow up
","After the dual success of Toy Story (1995) and Toy Story 2 (1999), when the production of Toy Story 3 was announced many like me were not surprised, but I didn't expect much, thinking what will be the next adventure for this crew. When the movie commenced with shots of Andy at his young age, I was smiling as it was good to see him all happy and his toys complete. Then it fades to show us Andy all grown up and ready for college, with the toys eager for some playtime with him. This new Toy Story animation had our Toys go through a stage when their owners are too old to play with them, and our toys got mistakenly donated to a Day Care, with Woody wanting them to go back to Andy's who wants to move them to the Attic.The new story of Toy Story 3, made me raise an eye brow as I was eager to see what was going to happen next; it was from that point I knew this was going to be a fun ride, and a fun ride it truly was. The removal of some of the old characters and the addition of some new characters, added to the fun. Disney/Pixar Toy Story 3 had it all, then there is the climactic scene near the ending where all of Andy's toys were at a junkyard and with all heading to a sure doom, they held hands ready to go down together. I remember the feeling I got when watching that scene; I was like, 'something better happen to save these guys.'With Disney's acquisition of Pixar in 2006, saw John Lasseter rise to be in charge of all Disney animation production, this gave more room to the production crew unlike the tight schedule and the back and forth talk they had to face while working on Toy Story 2. John Lasseter who directed the first two Toy Stories, stepped down from directing this one, because of the production of Cars 2 was in progress at that time and he was directing it. So Toy Story 2's co-director, Lee Unkrich was the sole director of this film, and he did a good work as this movie can stand beside the previous two, with its head held up high.Toy Story 3 won the Oscar for Best Animated feature and another for Best Original song, it became the highest grossing animation ever, grossing over 1 billion dollars and if you have taken the time to see the previous two Toy Stories then there is no reason you shouldn't see this one.www.lagsreviews.com",8,1,3,30 December 2012
Live Free or Die Hard," wow! it was off the hinges yall
","The bad guys have returned 12 years after the last (Simon Gruber), and this time they decide to take John's daughter, so he parks an SUV up their asses, takes out their helicopter with a police car and went all 'Yippee kai yay, motherfu@#er' all over the whole film. If you have not watched this wonderful addition to this beautiful action film franchise, then you are missing out, as I have said before in my Die Hard 2 review, Jack Bauer has nothing on this guy, in fact he wishes he could be as bad ass as this guy (John McClane). My favorite part in this movie is where Bruce Willis got his ass hand over to him by Maggie Q then he went all crazy on her.The Die Hard franchise made it to the 21st Century with Die Hard 4 and McClane was head over heels on top of the situation. This movie is so good that it is hard to believe it was made 12 years after the last Die Hard, because after Die Hard 3, I felt the producers have nothing else to add that will make this franchise a most remember, but then we are introduced to McClane as a father of an adult daughter and Daddy McClane don't play, and Daughter McClane is just as crazy as Daddy-O.The story follows McClane, who was in the wrong place again as he got involved in modern day warfare where the criminals use computers mostly to get the job done. John McClane (Bruce Willis) is sent to pick up a known hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long) and McClane happened to arrive in time to save Farrell from being killed. But this didn't stop the bad guy's leader (Timothy Olyphant) and his right hand girl (Maggie Q) from launching a cyber attack on the US.A nice movie, great setup wonderful screenplay and a most watch, after this was the latest Die Hard released in 2013, A Good Day to Die Hard.",8,2,3,2 March 2013
The Sixth Sense," i see dead people
","Sixth Sense is a well written movie that hits you from every end, here is a movie that tests your wits, you find yourself struggling to understand the character's predicament, and trying to see why things seem out of place, then you get to the ending of the film and M. Night Shyamalan trait of surprise ending hits you flat in the face and you go 'OH! That's why'Sixth Sense is a movie that is so great but sadly it is not a movie for retakes, since the entire suspense is revealed in the end, the actors in the movie also performed well, especially Joel Osment and there is Bruce Willis, showing off his prowess as one of the great actors of our time. To me Sixth Sense is the best movie I have seen him in, although the Die Hard series are exceptional, this movie just stands out in your mind and heart.Sixth Sense is a psychological horror film about the perils of a young boy Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment). Cole lives an isolated life, finding it difficult to mix with others; he sometimes sustains injuries on his body, which he gets when attacked, by the people he sees and talks to, people whom others cannot see. Cole sees and talks to dead people.A child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) with troubles of his own comes on board to try and help Cole deal with his problem, all to find revelations about his life that he was not expecting.Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, the movie script was first purchased by Disney before it was sold to Spyglass; Disney's president believed the movie was not going to be a hit. The movie production budget was 40 million and it was a financial success making over 600 million in the box office and the movie's tag line, 'I see dead people' is a popular catchphrase, used by many other movies, TV and songs.Sadly though this classic was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture but won none, this doesn't take anything from this movie as it remains a classic in every way.This movie is a masterpiece introducing Shyamalan for a great writer and director, this and Signs (2002) (with Mel Gibson) stand out as my favourite of his films. There is no need to spare any cash, just dash to the DVD store and get a copy of this masterpiece if you have not gotten the privilege of seeing it yet.www.lagsreviews.com",8,1,1,20 December 2012
Flight," Here is a movie with a terric flight by Denzel
","Personal internal struggle is what we all go through at one time in our lives, how we choose to handle it is what differentiate us from the addicts and the mentally depressed.Flight is about such a trouble, and the movie takes us through the downs of addiction, the repercussion it will have on your life and the lives of those who care about you. Robert Zemeckis takes us on a ride of emotional struggles with a strong cast of Denzel Washington, Don Cheadle and John Goodman Flight takes off smoothly and maintains a nice ride through the skies of drama and lands safely with you feeling fulfilled.The movies main scene where Captain Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) takes off and lands the plane during the planes steep nose dive, was engaging and was a terrific introduction to a great movie.The movie also has some comic moments that will make you laugh out loud.The movie's plot is about Captain Whip Whitaker, who lands a plane that is going to crash in a heroic and unexplainable way that even 10 top pilots using simulators were unable to do the same.His heroic landing saves the lives of 96 out of the 102 on board the plane, but there is a problem, while on the flight Whip was on cocaine and was drunk, which the NTSB were going to use against him as they wanted to pin the planes crash and deaths on him.Now with a top lawyer and an alcohol problem, he and Whip has to be able to prove to a jury that Whip has no addiction problem.Zemeckis has been away from live action movies for 12 years, one of his last live action movies was with Academy Award winner Tom Hanks in the movie Castaway.The movie screenplay was done by John Gatins, who said that the dramatic fictional crash shown in the movie was 'loosely inspired' by the 2000 crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261. The 2000 crash had no survivors and the cause was a broken jackscrew. The pilot of the flight attempted to recover from the flights loss of control by flying the aircraft upside down.The actors in the movie were all in top form, Denzel was as usual at the top of his game drawing you into the character with acting that is befitting of Academy Award nomination, and the movie screenplay is excellent each scene is intense filled with enough materials that will keep you awake.Robert Zemeckis is the man behind the movie Mars Needs Mom in 2011; he is also the man behind the classics Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1988 and the Back to the future series (1985, 1989 and 1990).Flight is a nice dramatic movie filled with emotional scenes depicting a man with serious addiction problem and a fun movie to see and enjoy.www.lagsreviews.com",7,1,1,14 November 2012
Rear Window," A wonderful movie i tell you
","Always close your windows and drains; there could be a peeping tom about.Rear window coins the phrase, 'an idle hand is the devils workshop', as our character 'Jeff' Jeffries played by James Stewart, who spent most of his days peeping into the houses of his neighbors, due to a broken leg that has him confined to a wheel chair.Rear window was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and is based on Cornell Woolrich's 1942 short story 'It Had to Be Murder'.The movie stars James Stewart and the beautiful Princess Grace Kelly. It was nominated for four Academy Awards and has remained in the top 50 of AFI's 100 YearsÂ…100 Movies list and on their 10th-anniversary edition.This movie is my third best James Stewart movie so far (I hope to see more) after It's A Wonderful Life (1946) and Mr Smith Goes To Washington (1939).The movie is considered to be one of Hitchcock's finest films. On the website Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of a 100%, so definitely it is a movie to watch.The movie plot is about a Professional photographer L.B. 'Jeff' Jeffries who breaks his leg while getting an action shot at an auto race.Now he is on a wheel chair with a cast on his leg and he can't leave his New York apartment. To pass time he peeps out his rear window observing the neighbors, memorising their patterns and trying not to miss a thing happening in their lives.Things starts getting thrilling when he begins to suspect that a man across the courtyard may have murdered his wife.There are movies whose themes can be said to have been based on Rear Window like Michael Davis's Eight Days a Week in 1999, Robert Zemeckis's What Lies Beneath in 2000 and Disturbia in 2007 which kinda reminds you of Rear Window itself except the protagonist (Shia LaBeouf) is under house arrest instead of on a wheel chair with a broken leg, and his neighbor is a serial killer other than having committed a single murder.Many TV shows too have used this Rear Window idea like The Simpsons, White Collar and more. But the TV movie that was done 1998 which was a remake of the 1954 classic is my best, I actually saw the TV movie first before seeing the original it stared Christopher Reeve, who himself was paralyzed as the result of a 1995 horse-riding accident, so he fitted the role perfectly.Well enough has been said about Rear Window, it is a classic Alfred Hitchcock thriller that I can say if you are watching all Alfred Hitchcock classic then you must see this one.www.lagsreviews.com",6,1,2,29 October 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," a beautiful ending
","The return of the king is a nice ending to a beautiful trilogy, wining eleven Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director, this movie is just too good an ending and if you are watching this trilogy, just look forward to the ending where you get to see, the ring destroyed (in the most unbelievable twist, that is if you have not read the book) and Aragon rise to the throne that he was meant to be upon. Here is what The Fellowship of the Ring movie was heading to, an ending that will remain the minds of movie watchers for years to come.The movie has a massive number of visual effect shots that triple and double that of The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers respectively, these shots can be seen clearly as the movie nears the end with the battles at Rohan which were quite filled with many CGI implementations and look forward to when Aragon goes searching for new recruits, there you will another set of visual effectsThe film and the novel differ so much but that doesn't deter the film from its professionalism in the master art of storytelling, from the hand of Peter Jackson. The movie show cases an intense directorial work, which you just have to be impressed about. The actors were just charming but in this movie three people stole the show, Elijah Woods (Frodo Baggins), Sean Astin (Samwise Gamgee) and Viggo Mortensen (Aragon).The movie tale continues from where Two Towers left up, Frodo and Sam are nearing Mordo and getting close to destroying the ring of power. The other members of the fellowship (which have united by the end of The Two Towers) went out to save Gondor from the hands of Sauron's army, the battle at Minas Tirith.As all this is going on, Elrond (Hugo Weaving, Agent Smith from the Matrix and V from V for Vendetta in 2005) approaches Aragon and tells him, the only way he can win this fight to save Gondor is if he wills the sword Anduril and claim that, which he has been running from; claim his Kingship. Hence the name of the film/novel 'The Return of the King'Making over a billion dollars from the box office, The Return of the King, sold more tickets than its previous two counterparts. Although The Fellowship of the Ring is considered by most to be the best of the three, this movie ranks second.After you are done reading this, it is not complete yet till you go and get the DVD Extended version box set of The Lord of the Rings and make sure you get the novels also.The Oscar wins for the movie at the 76th Academy Awards in 2004 were: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score, Best Original Song, Best Visual Effects, Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, Best Make-up, Best Sound Mixing and Best Film Editing. www.lagsreviews.com",8,1,3,9 January 2013
Pitch Perfect," as in, it is good i was impressed
","I really don't like chick flicks, they are all too predictable and at the very end they don't surprise you. Pitch Perfect is not that different from any other chick flick I know, but it was fun watching, the build up to the grand ending is the same as others, but the comedy is more matured and that made it easy to receive, other than the weak dialogues and lame script writing that are common in other chick flicks. I recommend that a guy should watch this with a girl.The thing that first turned me off in this movie was when I saw them singing, (I really don't like chick flicks and I hate music competition films) I just sat at the cinema hall thinking yikes!!! Then things started to turn and then I actually found myself laughing, the comedy that Pitch Perfect brings is very entertaining. It makes you over look the strings and loose ends in the movie.The funny thing about this movie again is that it is actually a non- fictional story, based on a novel of the same name by Mickey Rapkin. The movie stars Anna Kendrick (50/50 (2011)) as the lead in this college flick and it was produced by Elizabeth Banks (Man on a Ledge (2012)) who also can seen in this movie as she plays one of the commentators alongside John Michael Higgins (We Bought A Zoo (2011)).The movie is about two a cappella groups from a university but kind of like focuses on one of them, The Bellas and all female a cappella group, who recruited new girls into their group after their previous year disappointment, which led to them losing all but their two lead members.Beca (Anna Kendrick) joins The Bellas, and starts to shake things around a little, causing one of the lead members Aubrey (who is controlling) wanting to get Beca off the team as soon as possible, so she can regain full control of her group.The movie is directed by first timer movie director Jason Moore who is a regular stage and TV director, who in my view needs to work on his movie direction too, because the movie directorial was kind of weak, there were incidents where things happen for no reason what so ever. The lead girl Beca (Anna Kendrick) who happens to be a DJ, but all throughout the movie her DJ skills are not in any other way influential in the movie plot as a whole. Then the cheap Apple Macbook advert, comon we the viewers are not that dumb.Pitch Perfect made a good bunch from the box office making more than 84 million dollars compared to its 17 million production cost and it is highly rated having a 80% approval ratings from critics in the review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes. Pitch Perfect is a perfect chick flick, but guys can have fun watching this too.www.lagsreviews.com",6,2,5,28 December 2012
The Truman Show," this makes big brother look like child s play
","I sometimes wonder how my life will be if it were a TV show, I see this movie and i quit the wonder.The Truman Show was written by Andrew Niccol who got the inspiration from an episode of The Twilight Zone called 'Special Service'.After the script had gone through some re-writes, Jim Carrey was picked for the role, although the makers had to wait for him to have a clear schedule before he could start shooting.Made with a budget of over $ 60 million dollars, The Truman Show was a financial success and also was nominated for three categories in the Academy Awards, but did not win any awards.The movie tells the tale of an Insurance salesman Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) who lived his entire life, since before birth, in front of cameras for The Truman Show.Unaware of this fact, Truman's life is filmed through thousands of hidden cameras, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and broadcast live around the world, allowing executive producer Christof (Ed Harris) to capture Truman's real emotion and human behavior when put in certain situations that are concocted by the writers.The thrill about Truman's life is that everything is arranged for him, down to the woman he married to his best friend.The movie cinematography is such a way that you get to see mistakes from the show makers and how they arrange things in the back end to make Truman do some particular things.The script and the movie lines are fun, especially when the Actors had to advertise on the show. The could be a conversation going on then one of the actors will just drift to talk about an object in such a manner you wonder if they have lost it, only for you to figure out seconds later that it was an advert in the show, that was very creative.Before making this masterpiece, Jim Carrey had just finish Cable Guy (1996) and Liar Liar (1997).The movie is directed by Peter Weir (Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003)), who did a great job pulling the viewers along as they watch a movie of a show. Andrew Niccol went ahead to do more great movies from S1m0ne with Al pacino in 2002 to The Terminal with Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks in 2004.",8,7,8,7 September 2012
The Matrix," One of the best Sci-Fi classic there is
","The Matrix is a movie made to last the time barrier and always be relevant whenever the Sci-Fi genre is mentioned. The movie is a classic and it is known majorly for its use of the visual effect known as bullet time. It went ahead to win four Academy Awards for its Visual Effect, Editing, Sound Mixing and Sound Editing. The story arc is one that leaves you wondering and its ending is like beginning to many open possibilities.The Wachowski brothers took the best of the best of the Sci-Fi genre and an idea that never seems to stop plaguing the mind of many that one day computers will be taking over. The movie is directed by the brothers and produced by Joel Silver (who also produced Die Hard 1 & 2, Lethal Weapon 1 – 4, V for Vendetta (2005) and Bullet to the Head (2013)).The story arc is about a post apocalyptic future where humans were now used as fuel to drive machines. The human race developed 'THE A.I.' program, which in turn raged a war between it and its makers. In the end the human race lost and there are being grown for fuel, their brains are feed with ideas of a real life, while their minds live in a world called The Matrix.There the human race is living their lives like they normally do not knowing that the life they live is not real. The twist in this tale is, some figured out and the last collection of humans most are those taken out of The Matrix control live in a place called Zion. But there is a prophesy that a certain man will come and save the humans from the machines, and that man has been found by a man named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and his crew which include Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). The name of that man is Neo (Keanu Reeves) or as Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) calls him Mr. Anderson.The 1982 Disney movie Tron, was to me the main inspiration for the movie, as it features lives in the grid, that is lives in a computer system. Also The Matrix can be said to have drawn ideas from other movies in the 90s like The Truman Show (1998) where Jim Carey's life was being controlled by an external source and he was not the wiser, also I believe they got inspiration from Alex Proyas Dark City (1998) which like The Truman Show was done a year earlier . Also the fight scenes can be said to have been drawn from Japanese animation (Anime) which the Wachowski brothers took a likening into.After the huge success of this movie, the Wachowski brothers went ahead to make two sequels (The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions), which were both released four years after in 2003. The Wachowski brothers also further expanded the story with comic books, cartoons and video games. The Matrix is a good movie; in fact it is a great movie ranking high in any Sci-Fi list, the later Lord of the Rings trilogy and then the Star Wars prequel trilogy, started the whole trilogy phase that is now popular in Hollywood now a day.So it is best to get the above listed 3 trilogies.www.lagsreviews.com",7,0,1,31 March 2013
Looper," Looper is fun to watch and it delivers on expectation
","Looper has got loose ends and loops here and there, but Rian Johnson found a way to make simple a time travel movie without too much time travel back and forth.Looper was written and directed by Rian Johnson who teamed up with producer Ram Bergman, who produced Johnson's previous two films; it stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis, Levitt was a co-star in the movie Inception which had a story around travelling into the mind of people and Willis himself has had a taste of time travel with his movie 12 Monkeys in 1995. For me the reason I will advise anyone to see this movie will be the intrigue this movie delivers, from a story arc that curves around selfish ambitions. Johnson's version of the future in 2044 is also something you will like to see, with 10 percent of the world possessing the power of tele-kinetics, all morals gone out the window and an economic meltdown the world was in chaos.The story curves around two different times 2044 and 2074, in 2074 time travel is invented but illegal. Due to the fact that everyone is tagged in the future it was nearly impossible to commit murder, so the Mob had to find a way to get rid of people that they didn't want.The mob uses the time travel invention which is illegal to send men they don't want to the past to be killed, the assassins that do the killings are called Loopers.The job of a looper has a twist, after a while the Mob closes the loop on the looper by sending him a man to kill who happens to be himself 30 years from 2044. Now that is where the movie gets tricky. 2044 has two Joes, Young Joe from 2044 (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Old Joe from 2074 (Bruce Willis) which young Joe failed to kill although he tried.Although Looper slacks in the area of the story itself, the character Cid is a little too psycho to be believable but the movie is fun to see.The directing is top notch, the special effects are not so much in the high side and you can boast that you have seen better child actors, but hey! You will enjoy the time spent watching this thriller.",6,1,3,7 October 2012
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Wonderful is the word
","Star Wars without Han Solo is like Indiana Jones without his whip. The new star wars trilogy may have better CGI but they are no match to the old trilogy when it comes to memorable characters, dialogue and the thrill.Star Wars a new hope is enlightening, fun and draws you in to want to see what happens when the Empire Strikes Back. This episode IV is well designed there is not too much dragging in talk and theories just a brief introduction to all the characters involved and then straight to the main event. The CGI and screenplay is one that takes you by storm, as you watch this movie and compare it with the recent trilogy you start to wonder what the difference was, as the difference in the CGI is very minute.George Lucas is a visionary and what he started with star wars is what many have been dreaming of doing for time past, a franchise that can go on for a long time. This 1977 space movie is written and directed by George Lucas himself and this movie influenced many others that came after it. The movie was originally just named Star Wars; it was after its success and corresponding sequels and then Lucas idea to make a prequel to the sequel, which the movie now became Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope as the movie tend to follow the events that happened after Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.The Galactic Empire is led by the Sith Lord Palpatine and his apprentice Darth Vader, both have been in charge of the Galactic Empire for years, and they are facing an opposition by a group of freedom fighters known as the Rebel Alliance. The Galactic Empire has become more driven by technological advancement as the way of the force seems to be known by only few, the Galactic Empire have a new weapon named Death Star, a space station that can take out a whole planet in seconds.Detail plans of the Death Star were intercepted by the alliance and Princess Leia was taken it to the rebel base when she and her starship occupants were captured by Darth Vader. Before her apprehension she stored the data in her droid and sent it off to go find Obi-Wan Kenobi, the droid on its way got acquired by farm boy Luke Skywalker, and due to some circumstances beyond his control Skywalker decides to accompany Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi on a daring mission to rescue the rebel leader Princess Leia.The level of design in the movie is so well done that when an upgrade of the same set design is introduced in the new trilogy, you would feel the movies were made in the same time. Lucas upon production of the movie created his own special effect company Industrial Light & Magic to handle the effects in the movie, which was a huge leap ahead of others for the company.Here is a movie from the way back in the days that you just have to watch and admire the work that went into making it.www.lagsreviews.com",7,0,0,4 February 2013
Aladdin," you never had a friend like me
","Aladdin is a Disney cartoon with a character that we all wish we had as friend, the genie. Aladdin is filled with endless thrills, table turning plans and music that you can't help to like and sing along to. The movie's intro is in form of a narrative, where a merchant tells us the tale of Aladdin and his magic lamp.This 1992 Disney classic is based on an Arab folktale of Aladdin and the magic lamp from One Thousand and One Nights. The idea to make the movie was pitched in by the Late Howard Ashman (who died before the film's release) Ashman has been behind a lot of Disney classics from Oliver & Company, Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast. He was a writer, lyricist and producer and he was the lyricist for 'Arabian Nights', 'Friend Like Me', and 'Prince Ali' used in this movie.Aladdin's story is about a street boy, who runs into a princess named Jasmine who escaped the palace to see what life was outside the palace walls where you are not told what to do. While they were together Aladdin gets captured by soldiers under the orders of Jafar, the Grand Vizier to the Sultan of Agrabah (Jasmine's father).Jafar needs Aladdin to retrieve a magical oil lamp containing a genie from the Cave of Wonders.The movie's story now grows on what happened when Jafar didn't get the lamp but Aladdin did in an attempt to read the inscriptions on the lamp, released the genie and he is given 3 wishes.As the song goes, you never had a friend like me So it has been, because all through Disney toon history we never found anyone more appealing to have around, Genie is just the best person to have in at corner.The movie's screenplay explores fantasy, world travel, fireworks and action scenes.Aladdin was a box office hit, making over $ 500 million dollars in its theatrical run and also gave birth to two direct to DVD sequels and a TV series. Aladdin won numerous awards, especially for its music, it won only two Academy Awards, Best Original Score and Best Original Song for 'A Whole New World' and it also won four Grammy Awards, Best Soundtrack Album, Song of the Year for 'A Whole New World', Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for 'A Whole New World' and Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media for 'A Whole New World'.Like it or not, Aladdin boast of the best of the best music, and it was also funny and fun to watch, so if you don't own this DVD you Disney collection is not complete yet.www.lagsreviews.com",8,0,0,26 November 2012
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," This movie you must see
","The truth is, this movie is extremely funny, and far better than Madagascar 2. Never a dull moment while watching and every scene make you eager to see what was next. The makers went over board and decided to make the movie unrealistic to the core, Tom and Jerry style.DreamWorks Animation's CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg, confirmed in 2008 that there will be a part three to Alex and his crew's adventure, promising us that we will see them return to New York.The animation is just as good as the other installments and as usual the producers gave King Julien XIII (Sacha Baron Cohen, Borat 2006 and The Dictator 2012) his own story and this time it is a romantic one. But not only Julien had a romantic attachment.The crew is joined by bunch circus animals which they met when trying to escape from Captain Chantel DuBois, the leader of animal control in France.Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman are abandoned by the penguins and the monkeys who were trying to buy their way back to America. Alex and the crew found the penguins in Monte Carlo and started a chaos that led to the introduction of, DuBois. Their journey takes them through Europe where they find the perfect cover: a traveling circus, which they reformed.The most impressive addition and the star of the movie to me was DuBois, she was a cross between Terminator, Rambo and a Blood Hound. You will love the way she smashes through walls, but no matter how bad ass she was, the penguins were better.The lines, the screenplay and the penguins were far too much for my stomach to handle. There is a rumor that there will be a fourth installment, I hope it is true.Did Alex and the rest make it back to Central Park? That you have to find out yourself, so make sure when it is out in the cinema near you, you queue up to see it.",8,2,5,14 June 2012
Gladiator," here is a roman classic
","The movie moves in the realm of depression and just stays there. Gladiator shows the things that pushed an innocent hero to the point that death seemed like a relief from all that the world has taken from him. Maximus the main protagonist of the movie was portrayed by Russell Crowe in such a talented yet distinctive fashion that you do nothing but bow to the way Maximus handled his trials and tests to come out victorious at the end.Filming took place between January and May of1999 and the locations used were Bourne Woods, near Farnham Surrey in England, Ouarzazate Morocco and Fort Ricasoli Malta.The movie plot is about a loyal Roman General Maximus (Russell Crowe), who is betrayed when the Emperor's son, Commodus, murders his father to become Emperor of Rome himself, and burns down and kills Maximus family. After everything is lost Maximus is reduced to slavery and he having one determination, revenge, rose through the ranks of the gladiatorial arena, all in the hope of getting back at the man who killed his family and Emperor. Based squarely on a pitch by David Franzoni, who worked with Spielberg in Amistad, Ridley Scott was approached to make a movie from Franzoni's original final draft but he had the whole script re-written by John Logan who was the person that added the death of Maximus family, to create a lonely soldier with nothing to lose, but Franzoni was brought back as problems start to erupt in the re-writes, Frazoni did all he could to get the script back to the original draft. More issues sprung up, when Russell Crowe almost caused a total re-write of the script, whenever he asked questions he demanded answers and if the answers were not favourable, the script had to be re-worked.The movie can be said to have drawn plot from two older movies, The Fall of the Roman Empire and Spartacus both of which were done in the 60s. A lot of the plot foundation, like the murder of the emperor by his son who wanted to marry his sister, who (Sister) was in love with a General can be said to be taken from the movie The Fall of the Roman Empire. The gladiator aspect of this movie can be said to have been gotten from the movie Spartacus.Gladiator was a critical and financial success and it won 5 Academy Awards in the 73rd Academy Awards, the awards were Best Picture, Best Actor (Russell Crowe), Best Visual Effects, Best Costume Design and Best sound.Gladiator is a classic movie that gives you the fun to see the Roman Empire as some believe it was, rough and full of politics, here is another shelf nominee.www.lagsreviews.com",8,1,6,20 December 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Dark of the moon
","Transformers 3, this movie is a whole package of beauty, the best out of the three transformers. This movie is guaranteed to leave you glued to your sit till the credits start rolling in. Michael Bay, definitely saved the best for last, the dialogue in the movie is exceptionally well crafted to get the attention of both the lovers of comedy and drama. The fight scenes at times look a little clumsy, but after a few seconds you'll find your way around it. Bay did a good job in infusing Sam's parents in the movie in a way to add some drama. They made good use of slow motion in the movie so as to get the audience not miss a thing. Also the movie was sometimes too noisy and the use of visual effects was way up there. The story continues from where the last one stops, our protagonist now looking for a job after college and Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), blah blah blah, Optimus goes to the moon to save and bring to life an old autobot leader named Sentinel (voiced by Leonard Nimoy), we see the new girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), a blond sexy chick (needing more acting class and less Playboy drama), this happens that happens, Government as usual up to something (which we know they know nothing about) run by a bossy woman (Frances McDormand). Blah blah, is the end of the world someone get Sam!!! Bring in the U.S. military and somehow Sam gets wisdom from above and knows what to do to save the world. And there was a scene where Carly is trapped in a Decepticon car and it looked like the Car was fondling her??? What was that? Comparing Megan to Rosie the acting was okay, Megan Fox's replacement, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is not much of a good actress at all, but Bay must have really had it in for Megan cause you kinda actually I like her more than Megan Fox. I liked how the movie used the Apollo landing as a part of its story.",7,2,6,4 July 2011
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Classic....Classic
","What could be better than seeing what led to the whip and the hat that became the trade mark of our hero; what could be better than seeing Indiana Jones on a quest with his father and probably his mentor as they face odds and spiritual powers in high places.The thing that makes Indiana Jones movies a must watch is that it crosses various genres like action, adventure, thriller and spiritual/supernatural. Making sure that the viewer is intrigued by the blend. The father and son relationship is one blend that Spielberg did well as it was never a dull moment with the duo.The chase scene in the train where we get to see young Indy in boys scout uniform is one scene that I very much applaud, as it does not play on your intelligence, and it explored the realms of revealing some of the attributes of Indy and what led to them.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is directed by the legendary director Steven Spielberg who had to drop out of directing Big and Rain Man so as to fulfill his promise of making this movie with executive producer George Lucas.The Last Crusade is the third installment (and was meant to be the last) in the Indiana Jones franchise.The raiders of the Lost Ark was the best of the best when it comes to the Indiana Jones series as Temple of Doom fell short of the pedigree that the previous delivered, Last Crusade was taken through writes and re-writers so that it can serve as an apology to fans and win back their love for the whip and the hat Although to me Temple of Doom is not as bad as some say.The movie plot is centered on the Holy Grail. It starts with an introduction to a younger Indy (played by the late River Phoenix), where we get to see things that made Indy who he is like what led to his fear of snakes.It moves from there to a classroom where Indy is teaching his students and was drawn away from his teaching again to embark on another adventure, to find the Holy Grail and his missing father. His adventure led to Nazi involvement as they want the Holy Grail and the eternal life that comes with it.Shot in Spain, Italy, England, Turkey and Jordan, the movie was a financial success, earning over $474,000,000 in the box office and it went home with an Academy Award for Best Sound Editing.Here is one Indiana Jones you don't want to miss.www.lagsreviews.com",8,3,5,8 November 2012
Back to the Future," they Don't come any better than this
","Back to the future is one movie that contains excellent visual effects, a nice story plot and the directing is just excellent. The movie has a beautiful screenplay, and the movie puts the full stop in the statement, 'never a dull moment.'Michael J Fox was the desired man cast to play the lead role Marty McFly, but he turned it down due to scheduling conflicts, so Eric Soltz was cast in his place. After filming had begun, Zemeckis and Spielberg felt Soltz was not portraying the character well enough and knew this was a casting error, so they had to re-cast and ask Fox to try and make time to be in the movie. So Fox had to re-arrange his schedule time to be able to shoot Family Ties (TV Series) and the movie at the same time, this recasting meant, an extra 3 million production cost, as all the scenes that Eric had done had to be redone and Fox was so busy, that it was said that he only got 5 hours of sleep a day at the time.Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) is a teenager from the Eighties who befriends a slightly coco scientist Doctor Brown (Christopher Lloyd). During one of their meetings Doctor Brown mistakenly (due to an accident) sends Marty 30 years into the past, 1955 to be exact. Marty while in the past, mistakenly interrupts his parents meeting and he must find a way to fix it or else he will no longer exist. He also has to help the Doctor Brown of 1955 get him (Marty) Back to the future.Back to the Future was a financial success the movie's 100 days production cost was 19 million dollars (including the recasting cost) and it made over 380 million dollars in the box office. It was also a critical acclaim winning an Oscar for Best Sounding Editing.The balance in this movie is what makes it a most watch the movie's transgression from comic to science fiction to romance/drama, is what makes it such a most watch, it takes its time to explain even the complexity of time travel, that at the end even with the slightest of details that made no sense I actually was convinced and doubted not that Doctor Brown did it.Back to the Future is a movie hit for all to see and enjoy, it was that good that two sequels were added to it, Back to the Future II and Back to the Future III although the release dates for the sequels were 1989 and 1990 respectively all maintained the time of 1985 when the first time travel happened. So in the end of Back to the Future III, we were back in 1985.www.lagsreviews.com",8,5,7,28 December 2012
Goodfellas," just as good as the godfather
","Goodfellas is the best way to see the mafia, with Godfather given you a thrill of what the mafia life is about from the top; Goodfellas gives you the view of it from the bottom, as we see three guys work their way to the top.Goodfellas is based on New York crime reporter's (Nicholas Pileggi) non- fictional book Wiseguy, about the life of Henry Hill.Goodlfellas starts in the middle and moves backwards then forward. The screenplay was done by both Scorsese and Pileggi, who had to pull out 12 different drafts before they finally wound up with the script that was used to shoot the film.The movie is based on the life of Henry Hill; Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) always wanted to be a gangster, to help him along the way he got a job with a mob boss when he was in high school and there he met two other gangsters Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy De Vito (Joe Pesci) with whom he grew up with and they took part in many crimes in the city.After being involved in a heist that took America by storm, the group decided to kill off everyone else involved in the robbery, and slowly start to climb up through the hierarchy of the Mob. Boasting of a notable cast of Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, Goodfellas is noted as one of the greatest films ever made in the crime genre and during its initial box office success run it was nominated for six Academy Awards, which included Best Picture and Best Director for Scorsese. In the Oscar's Goodfellas went home with one award for Joe Pesci in the Best Actor in a Supporting Role. The film also got notable acclaim in the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, winning five awards including Best Film and Best Director.Goodfellas was Scorsese's most expensive film to date although the movie budget is small compared to other movies of such standard and was well received by critics holding a 97% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and it is ranked the second greatest gangster film by AFI (American Film Institute) behind Godfather (1972) and before Godfather Part II (1974).Goodfellas is a good watch any day any time and it will always standout as one of the best adaptation of mafia life, one you will like to own along side Godfather.www.lagsreviews.com",8,0,1,15 December 2012
Warm Bodies," This movie is cool
","Warm Bodies is a beauty and the beast love story crossed with the  typical zombie horror flick. The movie's pace is well done and the  movie itself is well directed by the director of the 2011 drama 50/50,  Jonathan Levin. He also wrote the screenplay, which he based on a 2010  novel of the same name (Warm Bodies) by Isaac Marion.  The acting in the movie is glamorous, from both the humans and the  zombies, and I did enjoy the makeup effect on the lead as he starts to  morph from a zombie to a human. The movies use of humor is well timed  and arranged as it is clever, when you feel it is getting a little too  serious, out of nowhere jumps a comic line that lightens the mood. The  other thing that you will enjoy is the Romeo and Juliet references that  the director made sure were present and obvious, as the lead characters  name is R which I believe R for Romeo and his love interest is named  Julie which I believe is in reference to Juliet.  The thing that attracted me to this movie in the first place was the  new idea of how the movie is viewed from the zombie's point of view; we  also get to hear his thoughts as he goes through life being an undead.  Set in a post apocalypse era, Warm Bodies is more about open  mindedness, the ability to accept that others can change. The movie is  more of a romantic drama than it is about humans going all Resident  Evil on Zombies.  The plot is about an unusual zombie named R (Nicholas Hoult) who  developed human emotions and craved for more. The humans during this  post apocalypse era lived a barricade life away from zombies who have  practically taking over the world. Part of the human settlement went  out to get some supplies, during that time they ambushed by zombies,  there R saw Julie (Teresa Palmer) and fell for her.  He then saved her from the others and made her stay with him during  which more emotional attachment developed between the two till she had  to go back to her people. But something new started among the zombies  that one act by R caused a revolution.  The movies score jumped out at me as being bad though, that is from my  view. The movie is cool, and the humor is really well timed and this is  a movie that I can comfortably advise that you should see.",6,37,53,11 February 2013
Jurassic Park," One of he greatest thrill ever
","One of my top thrilling movies ever, and it was made by one of the best director's known Steven Spielberg. This 1993 science fiction adventure film is based on the novel of the same name by Michael Crichton. Who was also hired to develop the screenplay for the movie.Jurassic Park won the Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing, and Best Visual Effects.Before Crichton published the book the movie is based on, he demanded a non-negotiable fee of $1.5 million which Universal paid for the rights to the movie and they further paid him 500,000 for the screenplay adaptation which Crichton noted that because the book was 'fairly long' his script only had up to 20 percent of the novel's content.The movie title depicts that the dinosaurs being featured all existed in the Jurassic period, but most of the dinosaurs your saw on screen didn't exist until the Cretaceous period, with the exception of Brachiosaurus and Dilophosaurus.The movie plot is about a billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) and a small team of genetic scientists who were working together to create an amusement park of cloned dinosaurs.John then recruits Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), a leading palaeontologist and Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) to come endorse the park; with them was Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), a mathematician and chaos theorist.John decided to take them all on a tour of the park; he also took along his grand children.Greed can be dangerous as one of the main programmers of the park decides to shut it down in other to escape with some samples of dinosaur DNA in other to sell them for profit. The movie is about a tour go wrong with hunger dinosaurs on the loose.The thing is Jurassic park started a revolution, because film makers were so impressed by the powerful CGI, that they knew that anything was possible. The movie raked in over $900 million compared to its $60 million budget, and it also gave birth to two sequels, The Lost World 1997 (directed also by Spielberg) and Jurassic Park III 2001 (directed by Joe Johnston) both were also financial success but none as close to that of the first.My favourite line in the movie was by Jeff Goldblum, 'God creates dinosaurs, God destroys dinosaurs, God creates man, man destroys God, man creates dinosaurs' I feel Jurassic park is one of my all time thrills, and i advice that you go get a dose of it again.www.lagsreviews.com",8,0,1,25 October 2012
The Wizard of Oz," Judy brings magic on every step
","The wizard of Oz is a colorful classic, that is filled with thrills and it is a straight shooter right from the start to the very end. From following the yellow brick road to finally meeting the wizard himself, it was a bumpy ride that I always look forward to going again.Filmed mostly in Technicolor, except the opening scenes which was shot in sepia-tinted black and white, The Wizard of Oz has stood the test of time as a top fantasy movie, with highly unusual characters. The movie is based on a book titled The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum, and although it did differ a lot from the book, this movie is the best adaptation that is near to its original book story.The movie plot is about Dorothy (Judy Garland) and her dog Toto who got caught in a tornado's path and somehow end up in the land of Oz. At Oz she mistakenly killed the wicked witch of the East, who was a sister to the Wicked Witch of the west, who was now after her. Now Dorothy must find her way home and the only person who could help her is the Wizard of Oz.On her to see the wizard she meets along the way a Scarecrow with no Brains, a Tin Man with no Heart and a Lion without Courage. Together this team head off to see the wizard with the hope that the Wizard will meet all their needs.The movie production had its twists and turns, with Ray Bolger who was originally cast as the Tin Man and Buddy Ebsen was to play the Scarecrow had their roles switched later on. This switch was to the detriment of Ebsen who had an allergic reaction to the makeup of the Tin Man and Jack Haley was called to take his place.Another thing to note about this classic is how it deviated from its original book story, up to 40 differences can be sited; from the merging of characters to the overall theme of the movie, this 1939 fantasy film carved out its own theme: in the book Oz is real and Dorothy did get to return in Baum's later books, but in the movie Oz is just a dream that Dorothy had.The movies popular song, 'Over the Rainbow' won best original song in the Oscars. Over the Rainbow has been re done by many artist notably Kyle Minogue during her treatment and recovery from breast cancer.Wizard of Oz is a classic that you must see, a nice fantasy film for you and the kids. Disney will be making a prequel to this classic, named Oz: The Great and Powerful the movie is set to be released in 2013 and it will star James Franco as the Wizard of Oz.www.lagsreviews.com",8,3,4,30 November 2012
V for Vendetta," Perfection meets art
","V for Vendetta is a cult classic, a movie that I never get tired of seeing, I get a regular dosage of V's antiheroes journey to bring freedom back to the people as much as I can; a journey that I always cheer him on wishing that the end was not so tragically inclined. With excellent filming and cinematography (the cinematography was done by the late Adrian Biddle who died before the films initial release), V for Vendetta contained one of the best dialogues I have heard in movies in years, and the scene where he was going to kill the Bishop, where we see V jump on/off the roof in a slow motion video take, was so masterful and it stays in my mind as the best scene in the movie, the second standing out scene is the introduction of V himself when he first met Evey Hammond.The movie is an adaptation of Alan Moore's V for Vendetta 10 issue comic published by Vertigo, which is based on the life of a man V, who was disfigured by some top government officials who used people who were different, either by race, homophobia behavior or character as guinea pigs to test biological weapons, only one man survived this test, but he was deformed physically and mentally, becoming very smart/intelligent, very strong and fast; this man V went after the government and those who were responsible for his current predicament. The movie has the same foundational plot as the comic, with Hugo Weaving playing V, Natalie Portman playing Evey his protégée and Stephen Rea plays detective Finch.There are many differences between the movie and the comic; like Evey, in the comic she is an insecure prostitute while here she is a confident young woman. V on the other hand who is portrayed here in this movie as a man with some human emotions and with a romantic link with Evey, in the comic no such romantic link exist and V is very ruthless and violent with no such humanize emotion existing. Also Finch was a die-hard get V man not a man who became soft and believed him.The screen play to this movie was done by the Wachowski brothers (The Matrix Trilogy). Who then did some comparison with V's life and that of Edmond Dantes in the book/movie The Count of Monte Cristo; Edmond also broke out from prison and plotted his revenge on those behind his imprisonment for years before finally sticking out.Moore who has been disappointed with two previous film adaptations of two of his other comics, From Hell and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, felt this was also going to be a flop but it was an average financial success and was critically accepted holding a 73% approval on Rotten Tomatoes.Hugo Weaving played V in this Wachowski special he played Agent Smith in their Matrix Trilogy. This is a great movie talking dealing with issues of homosexuality, criticism of religion, totalitarianism, Islamophobia and terrorism and a must watch for all.www.lagsreviews.com",8,0,2,25 December 2012
