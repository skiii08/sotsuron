The Blair Witch Project," Not Worth Price of Admission!!
","After all the hype about this movie I could not wait to see it. I left the theater very disappointed and feeling cheated. Although it had its moments most were boring. There should be a warning about motion sickness as you enter the theater because  the hand held cameras are in constant motion. While this is an interesting concept, it does get old before the movie ends. Wish I had saved my money and waited for cable!",3,0,2,27 July 1999
