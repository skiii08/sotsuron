Minority Report," spielbergs best since schindlers list!
","Wow where to start.  Tom Cruise delivers a satisfying preformance as john anderton.  However i was dissapointed with colin farrels performance as danny whitmore.  Speilberg directed this sci fi film very well and proved his talent hasnt died down over the years.  the special fx where top notch. but i feel as though the major flaw in minority report was the script, the dialoque was less than note worthy and the character development was poor. All and all this was a great sci fi action film and proved that tom cruise is the most bankable actor out there right now(sorry harrison maybe that'll change after indy 4).8/10",8,0,0,20 June 2003
Fight Club," Pitt proves he not just a pretty boy...again.
","Brad pitt takes the crucial role of tyler durden while the brilliant as usual Edward Norton continues amazing us all with his narration.  I've yet to read the book, but here good things.  The movie isn't for everyone how ever there are some kind of sick parts. But still a very entertaining and well thought out film.  One more star has a role in this film and that is singer become actor Meatloaf who plays i kid you not 'B**** T**s' does a suprisly good job.  I can't say much more because i don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasnt see it but if what i've described sounds good to you then check Fight Club out ASAP!9/10",9,0,1,20 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Breath taking
",I've been a big fan of the lord of the rings books for years as well as the hobbit.  I'm am amazed by what legendary cult film maker but unknown director peter jackson has done with this epic.  The time and the effort is just incredible.  I love how Jackson did this film.  Everything from the makeup to the weapons to the scenerary is incredible.  The cast is respectable to.  I hear alot of people critique the actors for poor acting but we have to remember that these are mythological creatures they dont excist so there extremely difficult to play.  Give the majority of the credit to peter jackson for pulling this film off.  Ian mckellan and Christopher lee both did a good job of the wizards but the biggest suprise of all had to be Viggo Mortenson a complete unknown who played the key role of Aragorn perfectly.9/10,9,0,0,21 June 2003
American Psycho," superb acting saves film
","American psycho is a great dark comedy about a younge wealthy mass murderer(bale).  What really stood out was the acting by christain bale, willem dafoe, and reese witherspoon.  The script is ok, the direction is mediocre, but the actings great.  I however recomend renting the unrated version though.  It's much better than the R rated version.  No matter what some critics say about this film i don't care it is worth seeing and is quite good.7/10",Null,0,1,20 June 2003
Apocalypse Now," The Greatest film ever made!
",from the very beginning of apocalypse now you can tell that there's brilliance involved. after martin sheen punches out the mirror it officialy becomes brilliant.  Martin Sheen along with lawrence Fishburne and dennis hopper and even a younge harrison ford in a cameo role turn in great performances.  Marlon brando performance however was not brilliant i believe he could have done some things differently.  Let me just say that coppola is perhaps the 3rd greatest director of all time and turns this chaotic war film into a masterpiece and a personal favorite of mine.  apocalypse now however is not for every one and could be taken as offensive to the unaware. so with that minor warning i recommend this film to all.9.5/10,9,0,1,20 June 2003
American History X," Where no man has gone before.
","American History X is a piece of brilliant satire that director Tony Kaye took to the next level.  No one has ever to my knowledge made a film about Nazism.  It's all ways been considered such a sacred thing that no director, producer, or movie goer would ever want to touch.  The amount of symbolism and irony in this film is unbelievable.   Edward Norton as usual delivers a brilliant preformance as a White supremicist who is jailed for murdering two gang members for attempting to break into his car.  While he is in prison his younger brother (Edward Furlong) begins to show signs that he is following in his brothers foot steps.  While in prison nortons character meets a group of fellow skin heads who end up turning on him.  It is then that he relizes that you can't hold a certain group of people responible for the actions of just a few, and that hate is just a waste of time.  The entire cast delivers an excellent preformance.  I strongly recomend this film to those with a strong stomach and a desire to see a film that wasn't made for profits, but made to teach something.  It's rare these days for a film to really teach something, but at the same time keep you interested and wondering whats gonna happen next.",8,0,0,21 July 2003
The Shawshank Redemption," just great
","I've seen the shawshank redemption upwards of 10 times and never get tired of it.  Tim robbins delivers his best preformance as well as morgan freeman. The two play prison inmates who become friends and devise a plan to escape. After that alot of sad things happen to them rape, beatings, solitary confinement, etc.  Morgan Freemans character is released while Tim Robbins succesfully escapes after bringing down the corupt warden and head guard. The acting is superb as well as every other aspect in the film.  I highly recomend this film to any avid movie buff like myself.8/10",Null,0,0,21 June 2003
Gangs of New York," well worth the extra wait.
","Martin Scorsese reveals this violent tale of early new york during the draft riots.  Granted there are a couple plot loop holes but the acting and direction more than make up for it.  Daniel Day-Lewis steals the show in a great preformance that SHOULD have won him an oscar.  Leo and Diaz both had all right preformances proving that they do both have some talent. Scorsese along with Daniel Day-Lewis SHOULD have also won an oscar for this film. despite the oscar snub and what the nay sayers claim this is a great movie with a little bit of everything(romance, action, drama, and yes day-lewis preformance even brought forth some humor and even horror.8/10",8,1,2,20 June 2003
