Deepwater Horizon," Must be seen in the theatres! (IMAX if possible)
","I usually don't write reviews but saw mostly negative reviews on here so far and that ain't right.It is not a perfect movie and it's not artsy, or profound. However it is very entertaining, has wide appeal, will make you laugh, have you on the edge of your seat and might even make you cry. It's a slow build at the beginning but the tension soon rises and you will then be hooked. The effects appear to be realistic and mostly practical made with a production value that appears to be one of the most expensive films ever made (which alone is impressive given it is not a sequel or superhero movie).Mark Wahlberg works as an everyman lead, but it is Kurt Russel who steals the show. Maybe the performance of his career, and the strongest aspect of the film in my opinion. Malkovich is also amazing as the villain, stealing every scene he is in. The two of them along with the incredible story done with top notch sets, effects and sound is exactly why you have to pay the money to see this on the biggest screen possible.If you need a film to be a character study or you want senseless action from start to finish then you might be one of the people who is disappointed. But if you are looking for a gripping story with great tension and action that can be enjoyed by a wide range then go see this film.",9,152,200,29 September 2016
RED," Sooo much fun!!! See it in theatres with an audience!!!
","You will leave this film laughing. The action scenes are really good but it's the characters and actors that makes this film worth seeing. The casting in this film was perfect! Great all around supporting cast. Morgan Freeman is always a nice touch to any film. Helen Miran firing a Rambo sized gun is worth the admission alone. If you miss the classic Bruce Willis Action Comedies this one makes up for all the bad ones in recent years. But what really makes this film worth seeing in theatres with an audience is John Malkovich! John Malkovich steals the show with maybe the performance of his career. If Johnny Depp can get nominated for 'Pirates' and Robert Downey Jr. can get nominated for 'Tropic Thunder', then Malkovich should get nominated for this, seriously. Every time he came on screen the whole theatre would be dying with laughter.Movies are expensive now and not all of them are worth seeing in theatre but this one is. It's not the best film ever made, the story could have been a little tighter, but I can promise you'll have a lot of fun and you will be laughing your ass off through most of it.",9,194,297,13 October 2010
