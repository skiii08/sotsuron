First Man," Perfect example of show don't tell.
","This film did a lot of things right, giving character to one of the most iconic moments in human history. The effects were well done, and the screenplay was a smart look into the life of Armstrong. It did a really nice job of showing the audience info, rather than just spewing exposition about Armstrong's life. Speaking of which, Ryan's Preformance of the roll was for the most part captivating with only a few static lines here and there. All around, the cast was strong for the film. The set design and costumes helped make it feel not only like the 60s, but the different rockets felt very realistic (thanks in part to the cinematography) and the soundtrack really added to the filmCostumes and set: 7/10
