The Ring," Creepy Midget-Boy With Too Much Purple Blush
","I saw The Ring yesterday. Pretty scary. I'm glad I hadn't listened to the numerous voices saying it wasn't that great. It wasn't great - at least, not in the same way as a perfect movie like The Sixth Sense, to which this film owes some debt, such as in the creepy-boy-harbingering-evil-spirits department. It was jumbled and contained some story threads that had you analyzing whether the plot truly made sense, or whether it was a product of kitchen-sink horror-moviemaking. And sometimes, you feel a bit like Atlas trying to keep all your disbelief suspended. Like when that creepy midget-boy is talking, and you can't decide whether to be creeped out, or whether the makeup artist should be censured for having put way too much purple blush around his eyes. Still, at its core this is a scary flick which I'm glad I saw. Especially enthralling is the videotape which, according to the plot of the film, causes you to die if you watch it. Modeled after early 20th Century Surrealist films, it definitely grabs. It kinda makes you wish the whole movie were filmed like that.",Null,0,0,22 November 2002
The Shining," Stranger In A Stranger Land
","Stanley Kubrick is my favorite director, and watching The Shining recently on DVD reminded me why. Kubrick has an uncanny way of setting up normal-looking objects and places so that they have an alien, spacey, distant quality. There are so many other adjectives one could use. He uses lighting, especially in The Shining, masterfully. The Shining, visually, is all about glows and indirect lighting, putting us in the mood for a ghostly story. Strange repeated geometric patterns, which Kubrick shoots with obsessive care, provide more mood, illustrating the relentless heartlessness of the icy world outside of the small bits of quivering, vulnerable warmth known as human beings. (The interlocking geometric carpeting which young Danny plays on, and the fabled hedge maze outside The Overlook Hotel are two prime examples of this.) Finally, even the camera work in The Shining contributes to its otherworldly, inhuman feel, as the camera flows down the hallways and around the corners of The Overlook like a ghost sweeping through a graveyard, or, even more relevantly, like the tidal wave of blood sluicing from the elevators in Danny's visions. The inhumanity in the way the camera moves - which is contrasted with the clumsiness of the human subjects the camera inevitably follows -  causes the sneaking feeling that there is something 'out there' which cannot be stopped.Like the best horror films, The Shining works its fear by building dramatic tension. Jack Nicholson's performance explores all the rage, delusion, and confusion needed to lead us down the path from normal world to the other-world of The Shining's darkest moments. When he does go over the top, he plays right into the movie's hands. Even Scatman Crothers' jovial performance, seemingly at odds with the movie's tone, allows something Satanic beneath the surface. Shelly Duvall's Southern neurotic is somewhat unexplained, but she does her best, and visually she could not be more perfect as the dark-haired willow in the haunted hotel. Danny Lloyd as 'Danny-Boy' holds his own in the surprisingly large number of scenes he is required to carry. His creepy 10-year-old voice screaming 'Redrum!' as Shelly Duvall sleeps may give you chills.",Null,0,0,6 September 2002
Donnie Darko," This is Frank
","What I liked best about this film was the way it was so lovingly directed. The camera pans over settings, landscapes, and characters languorously, as if trying to savor every aspect of this tale of a paranoid schizophrenic teenager who may see into other dimensions.Jake Gyllenhaal (as Donnie Darko) deserves to be lingered over. His performance summons memories of what it was like to be in high school and surrounded by real teenagers, not the fakey teens usually on display in Hollywood movies, even well-intentioned ones. Gyllenhaal's performance is a perfect melange of rage, vulnerability, fear and wonderment, tempered by psychosis. I don't know of many actors who could have pulled this role off as well, creating a character who is definitely mentally ill, yet is also someone the audience might want as a friend.Drew Barrymore and Noah Wyle both give impressive performances. Both are entirely believeable as high-school teachers, a great feat considering that it's hard to get the image of Wyle in a white lab coat (from ER), or Barrymore with bleached-blonde hair lisping babytalk in a 'girl road movie', out of one's mind when seeing them these days. Barrymore, especially, takes her energy level down several notches from her norm, portraying a woman without much overt 'personality', but with lots going on under the surface. She's still lisping, but now it's merely a speech impediment rather than an attempt at cuteness. Wyle also portrays a rather meek man who issues lots of shy grins, a person of limited heroics who indulges Donnie Darko's interest in time travel as far as he can without putting himself out.One of the best scenes in the film is a brief one where Barrymore and Wyle's characters sit quietly together. Barrymore just says, 'Donnie Darko.' After a pause, Wyle laughs. No more is said, and the film goes on to something else. But for that moment, we see through their characters' eyes as much as we see through Donnie Darko's for the rest of the film.",Null,1,2,25 July 2002
