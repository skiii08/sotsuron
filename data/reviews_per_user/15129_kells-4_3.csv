The Legend of Bagger Vance," Hey everybody!, its Matt Woods and Tiger Smith!
","Golf. A challenging game, but not half as challenging as sitting through this Redford rubbish. Has the man no shame? Smith shows us why he became the Mr T of the nineties. Damon tries once again to convince us he is the most talented human being on the face of the planet, playing yet another character with talent that just needs harnessing, (in this case by Smith, who's acting can only be described as 'fresh'). One wonders when Damon might like to join the human race, whereby ordinary people have to face life without amazing super powers, and show normal human emotional frailties, not wonder why they can't sink a putt. And for anybody who thinks thinks this represents any 'heal the world' effect on race relations.....see 'In the Heat of the Night' to get that stupid idea out of your head, then you'll feel a bit wiser about what constitutes racial commentary.
Far closer to the truth is that the era the film is set in, combined with the ethnicity difference of the the two leads are used to manipulate the audience in the most vulgar way. Far from being clever, it is type casting at its ugliest. I for one would be interested on Spike Lee's comments on this movie, which clearly was devised for the 'lap it up' consumption of the intellectual midget. If you sat down the movie audience before they viewed this movie, and asked them what they thought would happen in it, almost all would find themselves capable of predicting the basic story line (just by thinking about the concept). Therefore, those who find they hate this, have only themselves to blame. Its essentially like ordering junk food, you know what you're buying, you know the convenience, well its the same with movies like this, you're buying your piece of mind fodder escapism and thats it. This ones got double cheese.",1,5,11,7 April 2001
Cast Away," Staring Tom Hanks as...Tom Hanks
","WARNING: SOME MOVIE SPOILERS AND DETAILS ARE CONTAINED WITHINCUT TO THE CHASE, well not in this film.  In the beginning, a lethargic and reality-incongruent attempt to propel the emotive elements into viewer consciousness.  But for director Zemeckis, our fodder intellect need not apply to the language used in this film; the links in the build-up are forcibly coerced and the story line can't really get rolling as every notion is too telegraphed.  The audience know the disaster is looming, but it need not have been so auto-cued, even for Hollywood's version of Gilligan's Island meets sociological experiment.  For Helen Hunt, a talent of note, this certainly is not as good as it gets, while Tom seems initially a little lost himself.Then, the much heralded plane scene, so realistic I almost felt sick. Unfortunately, Tom Hanks is far too close to the front of the plane to have survived, but thats show biz.On to the next module dimension: Tom is cast away on a small island.  Here we see some cool acting by Tom, playing himself of course, showing us that even though he can be brilliant in films like The Green Mile, he can still be homogenized by an ill conceived dull script.  Tom takes over the movie by himself really, no directorship required.  There's the usual bits you'd expect: arrival, set up, learning of the environment, injury, defeat, craze, fight-back, planning, rescue, and hey presto, he's on a flight to Memphis with tasty refreshments.  And maybe I'm wrong, but I thought it was dolphins who loved helping humans lost at sea, not whales!
In the final setting: 'the cast away returns', Tom goes round telling those he so callously left behind, just how sorry he is that he wasn't there for them.  I felt a bit squeamish at that point, and it was heightened at the moment I saw my girlfriend crying as she uttered 'he's lost everything'. 'Yes, he has' I empathetically replied.Zemeckis seems determined here to paint us each like Robin Williams in Good Will Hunting, the empathy role, because, its not Tom's fault he wasn't there while he was stuck on an island for four and a half years, it's not your fault Tom, it's not your fault Tom, it's not your fault.  The final tease for me (well the first actually), was the best, the scene was set for the cheese ending, and then it had the plug pulled, and I loved it!To summarize, we paid our money and went through the alphabet one more time. If this is one of the five best films of the year then the world should stop making them.  The plane scene is the savior, but its not enough. Special marks though for casting Vince Martin who is actually famous in Australasia for being a 'know one' and becoming a very successful product pusher! Afterwards, those around me looked bemused, and the guy next to me gave me that look that let me know his girlfriend had been through a rough emotional roller coaster ride too.",6,0,0,5 April 2001
American Beauty," The midlife crisis all over again
","Entertaining movie with no weak acting whatsoever, Kevin's on fire here. Ultimately though, its contrived message is no substitute for substance and the movie comes off meaningless and laughably non-challenging.  The guise of social relativity wears thin half-way through and soon after the movie the duped audience heads for the nearest fast food joint.",6,0,0,2 April 2001
