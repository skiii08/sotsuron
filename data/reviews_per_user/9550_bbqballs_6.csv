Requiem for a Dream," A Powerful tell-all film
","Well the title says it all doesn't it, this movie certainly was a Requiem for a Dream. What a brutal, tell-all film that does not hold back on anything. This film focuses on the issue of Drug addiction, and how something that started out as a small addiction can lead to catastrophic events beyond belief. Throughout the movie I was thinking: 'by the end of this film I am going to be in shock', but to be honest I was not as shocked or in disbelief as much as I thought I would be. But I think this is due to the fact that these days we have been subjected to so much knowledge about drug addiction and we see so much of it that I guess we have become desensitized to the issue since the movie was made (2000). Overall it was a very well made film with some really interesting camera and editing techniques that you do not see used that much anymore. The acting was amazing; Ellen Burstyn who played Sara Goldfarb was absolutely brilliant. Jennifer Connelly was astonishing as Marion Silver, My god that would have been a hard role to play but wow did she pull it off, and quite fantastically I might add. This film is definitely not for the weak at heart and it will leave you thinking and somewhat shocked long after you have turned it off. 7.5/10",7,0,0,14 February 2009
The Mist," Great story, Well written
","To be honest I am not a huge Steven King fan, i did not see this movie because it was written by King, but thought it would be an interesting story. I was proved right.Let me start by saying that the CGI in this movie were not the best, and at times looked mediocre, but that is not everything after all. The plot was brilliant in this movie, and the screen writing adaption of King's novel was also evidently well done. The character development was good which really kept you on the edge of the seat throughout the movie. I again must say that this is one of those movies that will stay in your mind long after the film has finished. The build up to the end is ever so brilliant and what actually happens and at end will leave you shocked and not knowing how to feel or think.Very well told story, and quite a well made movie.7/10",7,2,5,3 February 2009
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," One of the most amazing films I've ever seen!!!
","The boy in the striped pajamas is an absolute masterpiece and is one of the most affecting pieces in cinema history. Based on the novel by John Boyle and set during WWII, the film revolves around and is in the perspective of an 8 year old boy, Bruno, the son of a commandant at a concentration camp. Bruno befriends a Jewish boy named Schmuel but the forbidden friendship with the boy on the other side of the camp fence has startling and unexpected consequences.This is by far one of the most amazing and most stunning films I have ever seen. The emotion that this film brings to the audience is like nothing I have ever seen before. The character development is so precise that you are so engaged in the film from the very first scene. The director, Mark Herman, has really brought something special to the screen here. He has been given a vision of an amazing story and he has stunningly and so effectively brought it to life. The scenes that Bruno and Schmuel share are so beautiful and you can really feel the friendship building throughout the film.As the audience we know exactly what is going on outside of Bruno's own mind and world, and what exactly is happening to the Jewish people in the camps but Bruno's innocence and naivety to the world around him is masterfully shown by Herman.The acting in the film is at its best. Verma Farminga is absolutely beautiful as Mother and her dramatic scenes with David Thewlis (Father) are so convincing and so emotional. She brought a lot of emotion and feeling to the character of Mother and she really has shown her true talent in this role.The child actors were just as good. Asa Butterfield was brilliant as Bruno and was perfectly casted for this role. I really couldn't imagine Bruno as anyone else. This is Asa's first major feature film and he really has proved that he has some real talent. Jack Scanlon as Schmuel is also fantastic.Overall there is really not much you can fault in this film (if anything) and this is a fantastic achievement in cinema. I truly believe that no matter whom you are, this film will affect you in some kind of manner",9,1,2,28 April 2009
The Happening," Absolutely Horrible
","This movie was an absolute joke. It was probably the worst movie i have ever seen and that is not an exaggeration. I cannot believe this movie is from M. Night Shyamalan. I have really enjoyed all his other films and considered him a great writer and director but this one has brought him right down. The acting was atrocious (including Mark Wallberg). Mark seriously acted like a B grade actor, i only hope he can redeem himself in Max Payne. The plot was horrible, the special effects were mediocre, the story was beyond stupidity, this was just overall horrible movie. PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME ON THIS PATHETIC EXCUSE FOR A FILM.I hope you have a damn good look at yourself Shyamalan and in the future don't bother with pieces of crap like this, you are much better than that.",1,5,9,19 October 2008
Slumdog Millionaire," Absolutely Amazing
","This is one of those films that you do not come across very often. It was absolutely amazing. This film is one of the most well written, well directed films I have ever seen. The non-linear narrative was executed perfectly and the plot was astonishing. Every single actor in this film, especially the child actors, played their roles perfectly and the casting was so spot on as it was hard to imagine these characters being anybody else. The character relationship between Jamal and Latika was brilliant and the development of the characters throughout the movie kept you on the edge of the seat wanting to find out what is going to happen to them next etc. The soundtrack (music) in this film was mind blowing, every song selected, every sound effect fitted so perfectly within the film, some moments gave me shivers and goose bumps and the music was so gripping. This movie by far deserves to win the Oscar for best picture and i will not be surprised if it takes out all 10 Oscars it has been nominated for.A definite MUST SEE 9/10",9,2,5,2 February 2009
Valkyrie," Brilliantly film
","Wow, this movie was amazing.It was very well written and directed, and the acting was astonishing. Again Tom Cruise has mastered his character and acted it perfectly, I could not flaw one thing in Cruise's acting throughout this movie, and every supporting actor was also astonishing.This movie was such a change from the modern day Hollywood movies we see which are all about the CGI and who can spend the most money. This film focused so much on the story and pulled it off so brilliantly. The other great thing about this film was that it put you in the perspective of German soldiers during WW2, and how they were caught in a war machine, war mongering Nazi Germany, and how they hated it just as much as anyone else in the world. It gives you a great perspective that not all Germans were war hungry and not all Germans were responsible for the atrocities of WW2.Overall a truly fantastic, well told story that will stay in your mind long after the movie as finished.8/10",8,1,2,2 February 2009
