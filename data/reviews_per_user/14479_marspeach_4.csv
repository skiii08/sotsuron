The Young Victoria," Beautiful
","When most people think of Queen Victoria, they probably think a fat little prudish woman. That was certainly her image as she got on in years but by focusing this on when she is a young woman (and played by the beautiful, slim Emily Blunt) she definitely has more appeal to audiences. The movie is gorgeous, beautifully acted (loved Mark Strong as Sir John Conroy. He's much better playing villains like this and Lord Blackwood in Sherlock Holmes), and really romantic. As a historical work alone it's probably not the best but as a historical romance it's great! The costumes are all really eye-catching. I was surprised at how much I liked them! It's my least favorite era in fashion history and most of Victoria's gowns are borderline gaudy (she is the queen after all!), yet the costume designer and Emily Blunt managed to make them work.",8,1,1,27 April 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Best Yet
","The acting was outstanding. I've always felt Rupert Grint as Ron was the most natural of the trio but up until now he hasn't had much to work with, usually stuck as comic relief. Finally he got to show off more of his skill in some real dramatic moments. Emma Watson's Hermione was the weakest to me in the first five films, overacting and constantly wiggling her eyebrows. Thankfully she improved in HBP and got even better this time! I thought the two of them outshone Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, who was good, don't get me wrong. He just slightly paled in comparison to the other two. The supporting cast was equally good. Peter Mullan was very intimidating as Yaxley and even better than I imagined him in the book. Nick Moran's Scabior played a bigger role than in the book and was almost alluring in a really creepy way. Helena Bonham Carter's Bellatrix was a touch toned down from the previous films, which I was grateful for. I was also so glad we finally got to meet Bill Weasley and Mundungus Fletcher.The soundtrack was really good. I particularly loved Obliviated in the beginning because it caught my attention right away and Farewell to Dobby because it was so beautiful and moving. The cinematography was also excellent. I wasn't fond of the camping scenes in the book but I didn't mind them in the movie because of the gorgeous location shots! Nearly all of the individual scenes were well-done, with a perfect balance of drama, action, and comedy. My favorites were Hermione erasing her parents' memories and the silver doe. I was confused about the Harry/Hermione dance scene because I felt it was a bit out of character for Harry, but it was actually pretty cute.The film wasn't perfect. My two biggest complaints were the lack of explanation for the mirror shard and no use of the invisibility cloak. Since the cloak is one of the Hallows, wouldn't it have made sense to remind the non-hardcore audience about it? Similarly, those who haven't read the books will be scratching their heads trying to figure out where Harry got the mirror shard.I also felt Ginny was really a nonentity. Hers and Harry's romance was poorly treated in HBP as well and I was disappointed that it was more of the same this time.My other complaints are really minor quibbles in comparison. I missed seeing Dudley and Harry's handshake, even though the movie works perfectly fine without it. I would have liked to see Harry and Ron hug after the destruction of the locket and have Harry assure Ron that he only sees Hermione as a sister (especially since some viewers thought he was trying to come on to Hermione in the dance scene!). I also felt Malfoy Manor, while a nice scene in itself, paled in comparison to the book. It was slightly rushed and watered down- namely Ron's reaction and Wormtail's fate. I suppose this was done for a reason, and it does work in the movie- but the book scene was so much better.The end only made me want Part II right now! I guess I'll have to reread the book to satisfy myself until July.",9,0,3,27 April 2011
Pride & Prejudice," Such a beautiful movie
","This is by far my favorite adaptation of Pride and Prejudice (and I've seen all the available versions except the Mormon one- 1940, 1980, 1995, and Bride and Prejudice). This movie is very realistic in that it portrays how unclean times were back then (no, it's not dirty or gross or anything, don't worry). Perhaps the filmmakers went a little too far in the case of the Bennet house, but that was done to contrast their situation to those of Darcy and Bingley.The casting is excellent. I was hesitant about Keira Knightley at first (I'd only seen a couple of her other movies and liked her in Bend it Like Beckham), but her Lizzy blew me away. She portrayed the arch, outspoken side of Lizzy as well as her sweet, unoffensive nature. She also really showed the character's youth. Matthew McFayden's Darcy was totally different from any interpretation I've seen (shy, puppydog) but I couldn't call it inaccurate. He and Lizzy really have chemistry together. Brenda Blethyn was an amazing Mrs. Bennet- she is annoying and embarrassing but believable not over-the-top. Rosamunde Pike is the beautiful Jane I have been waiting for. None of the other Janes I've seen are even as pretty as Lizzy. Some of the changes people might not like (but that I love)- Bingley is more of a goof, Caroline is a little meaner, Mary is prettier, and Mr. Bennet a more caring father (this one did bother me a little).On top of the great cast, the cinematography is breathtaking, the music is beautiful, it uses a lot of Austen's own dialogue (but changes some of it slightly), and it's also hilarious. This was perhaps my favorite movie of 2005.",10,3,7,6 July 2006
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Huge expectations not met
","I can't even describe in words how much I was looking forward to this movie! Deathly Hallows is my favorite Harry Potter book, and Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is my favorite Harry Potter movie. All of the trailers and featurettes and early reviews made the movie sound absolutely amazing. I try usually not to let hype get my expectations up too much, but in this case I couldn't help it. I was fully expecting the series to go out with a bangLet's start with my general, spoiler-free opinion. Were my high expectations met? Sadlyno. It was a big let-down, actually. It didn't feel like part of DH 1. It was more similar in tone to the Half-Blood Prince movie to me for some reason. It was too short and just felt chopped up. Like HBP, it seemed like a lot more was filmed, but then it was hacked in the editing room. And then I read that this was exactly the caseAll of the actors, practically, from the previous films are back- for mostly blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameos. The battle was lackluster and anticlimactic. At points it felt rushed, at other points too slow. A lot of the dialogue was changed and didn't feel right. The relationships were handled awkwardly. This is just my purist side, but a lot was changed from the book. I didn't think it would be that way, after Part 1. It really let me down.Was it a terrible movie? By no means. The acting was good, the special effects were great (though I wouldn't pay the extra money for the 3D), and some of the scenes did hit the mark. I know I bashed it pretty hard up there, but, really, the majority of my complaints are based only on the changes from the book. I'm judging it not really for the movie it was but for the movie it could have been, the movie I wanted it to be. The hype definitely ruined things for me. I feel like I would have liked it better if I hadn't read the books. But then again, my brother, who has only seen the movies, was also let down. He was disappointed by the lack of a bit epic battle scene that he was expecting there to be.And now, to put in some spoilers:My main complaint is that the film was too rushed. It was the shortest in the series, yet it didn't need to be. This was the ending, so I feel like they could and should have taken all the time possible to make it perfect. A lot of the key points and characters from the book are in there, but for a split second! Hardly anything made much of an emotional impact on me because it was just BANG, move on to another scene without any time to digest anything. The moments that moved me the most were The Prince's Tale and The Forest Again, because they were slower pace. Like a lot of Part 1, they gave the scenes time to breathe so I could actually digest what was happening.I was so disappointed with the lack of the side characters. They were all brought back and there was all this build-up in the beginning leading the audience to believe that they would be featured in some epic battle scenes. But they weren't! We saw a couple cool shots of them getting ready for the battle and a couple seconds of them fighting, but that was it. Lupin and Tonks had one nice moment reaching their hands out to each other, but that was it before we see their dead bodies. We never learned about their son, so when Harry mentions it in The Forest Again, instead of being an emotional moment, it's just a head-scratcher. The same goes for Fred Weasley. The twins have a nice but waaay too brief scene on the roof and Fred's only line in the movie is 'yeah.' I was so mad we didn't get the wonderfully written, abrupt, and tragic death scene in the book- or at least have him featured in the movie a bit more! Lavender Brown is clearly brutally killed, but it's never mentioned again. Hagrid is mysteriously absent during the whole movie until he suddenly shows up as the Death Eaters' hostage in the forest. How did he get captured? What was he doing the whole time?My next big complaint also has to do with battling- namely, the handling of the Molly/Bellatrix and Harry/Voldemort duels. Where were the audiences during these scenes? Molly vs. Bellatrix is over in a second with no one watching. The intensity of the book scene is totally absent because it's over in a split second and it wasn't treated as as big of a deal. Mrs. Weasley just smiles in satisfaction to herself afterward, which I felt was totally out of character. Harry and Voldemort's duel, on the other hand is terribly drawn out to be made more 'cinematic.' I didn't really care to see them falling over the side of the castle or the Dragonball Z-esque drawn-out shot of their spells colliding. And then Voldemort just disintegrates once Neville kills the snake? Okay, I get that all his horcruxes are gone, but he still actually has to be killed! I never saw the spell actually hit him. And once again, like Molly and Bellatrix, no one is watching. And afterward- where's the reaction from everyone? They're all just chilling in the Great Hall waaay too casually. No cheers and whoops or sobbing and laughter? It was too toned down.Ah, my expectations were just way too high for this. The wonderful book and Part 1 just got my hopes up so much. Part 1 was so faithful and let the story breathe. This didn't have the same feel for me and of course I was let down.",Null,3,4,23 July 2011
