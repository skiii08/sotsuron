The Avengers," Nothing but a Disappointment
","I was really looking forward to seeing this film after hearing so much good feedback, however when I finally saw it I was disappointed by the lack of conflict and sense of the entire film. Normally in films the bad guy actually comes somewhere close to winning or at least gives the 'heroes' some trouble. In this film Loki seemed weak and powerless compared to the heroes. Most of the main characters weren't needed like Black Widow, Hawkeye, Thor, and Captain America. The same results could have been achieved if the Hulk and Iron Man were the only heroes. The ease that the Avengers had in defeating Loki made the film boring and regrettable to watch. I found myself on the verge of falling asleep during this entire film. This film is nothing more than any other mundane action movie.",6,5,13,9 June 2012
