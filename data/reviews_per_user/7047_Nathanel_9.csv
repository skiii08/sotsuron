The Blair Witch Project," Inventive and original
","The Blair Witch Project had some pretty chilling moments. Some people in the theater were disappointed at the ending because the witch or whatever other horror was stalking the film students was never revealed. I thought the ending could have been a little better, but I liked the element of ambiguity and think that it adds to the terror of the movie. Being an avid woods man, I was annoyed with the stupidity of the students and how they handled their situation, but I guess it was necessary in order for the movie to work. Using the 16mm film added an incredible element of realism to the movie. This in my opinion was the movies strongest asset. The movie feels so believable  that many people in the theater actually thought they were watching real, authentic footage. The Blair Witch Project was an interesting movie, and if one allows themselves to become one of the campers and accept what is happening on screen, the movie is pretty darn chilling.",6,1,1,2 August 1999
Catch Me If You Can," Boring Fluff
","Spielberg needs to stick to the ideas that were used in A.I. and Minority Report and stay away from this light, fluffy nonsense. CMIYC is watchable and has a few amusing moments, but overall I found it uninteresting and very superficial. I live in Boston and couldn't tell Hanks was trying to use a MA accent; what an awful performance. I would not recommend paying more than $6 to see this movie.",6,0,3,1 January 2003
Memento," A mental whirlwind
","WOW. Immediately after I saw this movie, I bought another ticket for the next show and went through an entirely new experience. You absolutely have to see this movie at least two times. There are so many tiny hints and clues that you have no way of picking up on the first time through. I don't think I've ever seen a movie that made me think as hard as I did while viewing it.    Incredibly innovative and clever, Memento is one of the best movies I've seen. It did such a brilliant job of putting us right beside the main character, making us believe him because we don't know any better, yet when the movie's over you look back and come to a logical conclusion that was so vastly different from what you started out with. In a way, the viewer is deceived and manipulated and I love that. 10/10 (which I've given to only 4 other movies)",10,0,1,5 June 2001
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Do people really understand the satire?
","I will admit I am not a big fan of South Park. I've only seen about 4 tv episodes, and I don't find the crude humor that amusing. So as you can imagine, I wasn't expecting that much out of the movie when my friend dragged me into the theatre. After watching the movie, I am still not really a South Park fan, although there was something about the movie that was both impressing and disturbing. South Park is an incredibly sardonic, cynical movie. The entire film is basically poking fun at our society in recent times. A logical parallel can be drawn between the plot of the movie, and our nation's attack on violence in the media. While the teenagers in the theatre laugh at crass remarks such as the Uncle $@%!# song, do they realize that they are symbolizing the very objects that the makers of the movie are so heavily poking fun at? If one realizes this, it is very amusing, and for me was probably the funniest part of the movie, however I am afraid that the majority of the kids seeing this movie do not realize that they are laughing at themselves and other controversial parts of our society that so many of us share.",5,1,3,9 July 1999
Blade," Entertaining
","Blade had a pretty simplistic plot and mediocore acting. However, for an action/fighting film, the battle scenes were done exceptionally well. They reminded me a lot of The Matrix, which in my opinion has the best actions scenes of any movie. The atmosphere was dark and fit the movie well, also like The Matrix. If you enjoyed The Matrix, then you will definitely like Blade.",7,0,1,30 July 1999
The Patriot," Horrible!
","By far one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen. I was expecting so much after all the hype and the good reviews I had seen by so many other people. This movie fails in so many ways: There was way too much extraneous footage;It could have easily been an hour shorter.    So many of the scenes were so cheesy. They tried to make them sentimental or emotional and it just plain failed e.g. the scene where Mel's youngest daughter starts crying, 'I'll say anything you want just don't go.' It felt so fake.   The dialogue was poorly written also. The only well done scene in the whole movie IMO was when Mel goes after and slaughters the 20 red coats. That was the only scene that can even be partially compared to the greatness of BraveHeart.",3,1,2,3 July 2000
American History X," mesmerizing, raw look at racism
","I always know a movie is good when I can't stop thinking about it even a few days after I've seen it. American History X is one of the more intense, riveting dramas I've ever had the pleasure of watching. Edward Norton's performance was breathtaking, and it puzzles me why he isn't casted more often. This movie totally disillusioned me and showed just how incomprehensible a true racist's mind is. I still can't shake the last, dramatic and shocking scene from my mind. It was one of the few times I've wept openly during a movie, and it shows the absolute futility of unconditional hate. This movie isn't for the emotionally immature. If you're not going to take it seriously, don't bother watching it. However, for all those strong enough to handle the emotions, this movie should be a jaw-droping, eye-opening rollercoaster of passion and drama.",9,0,0,21 July 1999
Saving Private Ryan," 'War is Hell.'
","An awsome depiction of the unimaginable horrors of war, Saving Private Ryan is a visual masterpiece. The opening scene of carnage and slaughter should slice through even the most imperturbable viewer. Sometimes I try to tell myself that I would have been strong enough to witness the atrocities of war without breaking down, but after seeing this movie, which so artfully put the viewer in the thick of the battlefield, I know with certainty that, God forbid, if I had to endure what these WWII veterans went through, my mind would have shattered into thousands of pieces that to this very day I would still be trying to put back together.",Null,0,0,23 July 1999
A Night at the Roxbury," stupid humor
","A ridiculous movie about two utter morons, A Night at the Roxbury had a few amusing moments. However, The main characters' repulsive behavior ruined any humor there was to be found. The only time I'd recommend this movie is if you are with a bunch of friends, and you are really in the mood to laugh while you are making fun of a movie for its stupidity.",3,1,5,30 July 1999
