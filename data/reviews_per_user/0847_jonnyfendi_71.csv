The King's Speech," All Hail The King
","Giving a public speech has always be a difficult thing to do for most of the people. Not everyone could deliver it well. you could simply change your job if it doesn't suit you. But it will not be that simple when you are a King. King George VI is the father of Queen Elizabeth II. Thiz is the story about the early years of his reign in 1920-1940s. For his difficulty of public speaking, to heal his stammer, he hires an Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) and learns it through some unorthodox techniques. Later, in addition to that process they bound to some manhood relationships and find greater meaning of life. The movie is directed by Tom Hooper who is known before for a movie about the famous football club Leeds United in 'The Damned United' (2009). In thiz film, he applies many unusual styles. The cinematography is very interesting. In one moment he puts the face of the characters precise in the middle of the screen, leaving significant unusual distance. In another moment, he puts the object precisely in the lower left of the screen. Most of the times, everything looks even different, he provides three dimensional view with his concave perspective. It is eccentric but works quite well. Those techniques emphasize the honesty and integrity through its story-telling. But the element that makes thiz movie works really well, it's Colin Firth who transforms his body and soul to be Duke of York or better known as King George VI. I could feel his effort and weakness clearly in his complex character. No doubt is one of Firth's best performances of all-time. The other great role that deserves to be mentioned is Helena Bonham Carter as his wife Queen Elizabeth. Thiz is one of the rare times I find that she could be so normal, after her previous roles that were mostly Gothic. Guy Pearce is quite convincing too as his older brother who is forced to abdicate, Edward VIII. The small but interesting role also comes from Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill. Last time, the Director Tom Hooper lifted incredible story about football, he didn't get much attention although it was a great movie as well. Now with the same quality of work, plus extraordinary performance from Colin Firth, he surely will get more attention than before. That's the difference when you take the story between football and real monarchy. It needs a great speech to be a great leader, but it needs a great heart to be a great King.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",8,1,2,10 February 2011
The Avengers," The Earth's Mightiest Blockbuster Movie
","Why 'The Avengers' could easily become a huge success? I think even some of you could answer thiz question. Thiz movie is the culmination of Marvel's hard work over the past couple of years. The lucky guy who was appointed to direct thiz movie is Joss Whedon. The director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) initiates the Avengers initiative by assembling all the super humans to save the world from the powerful evil Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The storyline isn't as dynamic as I think it is, there's a time when the story is stuck and filled with unnecessary dialogue. The power of thiz movie obviously lies in its character interactions. Nick Fury is originally written as a white guy in the comic book but Samuel L. Jackson confidently steps in to play thiz character. Thiz isn't the first time thiz has happened. It reminds me when Michael Clarke Duncan portrayed the overweight crime boss Kingpin in Ben Affleck's 'Daredevil' (2003) and I'm also so excited to see Laurence Fishburne as Clark Kent's boss Perry White in upcoming Superman's 'Man of Steel' (2013). However, in thiz case, I didn't see Samuel L. Jackson became Nick Fury, instead it was Nick Fury became Samuel L. Jackson. But in the end, it's totally acceptable. Samuel L. Jackson is able to present a precise leadership aura to his Nick Fury's character. Once again, I have to remind you, what made thiz movie so interesting is when these superheroes gather around and interact with each other. We can see 'The Duo Chris', Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth who successfully demonstrate their muscular bodies, just like in 'Captain America: The First Avenger' (2011) and 'Thor' (2011). Thiz is how superheroes should look like! The brand new figures in thiz movie are the master archer Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and the elegant Agent Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders who is widely known in 'How I Met Your Mother' {2005-present}). The other figures who have been introduced since 'Iron Man 2' are the loyal Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) and the sexy heroine Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Surprisingly, Scarlett Johansson has a fairly large part in thiz movie. Wait a minute, on second thought, if you have Scar Jo in tight sexy latex suit, of course you will exploit it more. If we're talking about Iron Man, thiz is also one of the most interesting parts. It looks like Robert Downey Jr. have already fused into thiz Tony Stark's character so deep, he can represent thiz self-centered character very well without any problem. But in thiz movie, the one who really becomes a scene stealer is the giant green rage monster named Hulk! Once again, it's the Hulk's character, not exactly Dr. Bruce Banner or Mark Ruffalo but it's all of them in one. Some fresh and funny moments are obviously when Hulk is around. The most unfortunate thing is that they didn't bring up the original founding team such as Ant-Man and The Wasp into the movie. In the end, I confidently can say Marvel Comics seems to be one step ahead from its competitor DC Comics so far. Recently, thiz movie has ruled the box office chart and it turns out to be the earth's mightiest blockbuster movie. You know what that means, right? Oh yeah, the next Avengers movie will be coming soon. Maybe next time Marvel Studios will enrich their universe with the presence of other superheroes like Quicksilver, Black Panther, Vision, Doctor Strange, She-Hulk, Wolverine, even Spider-Man. Are you ready for another one?Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",8,1,4,24 May 2012
Black Swan," It Was Perfect
","The little girl in 'Leon: The Professional' (1994) has grown up now. Natalie Portman is at her peak performance so far. Team up with heavy caliber Director Darren Aronofsky, they made a beautiful story but horrifying at the same time. Aronofsky is invincible, especially when he explores human desperation, like in his previous films 'Requiem for a Dream' (2000), 'The Fountain' (2006) and 'The Wrestler' (2008). For about 100 minutes of the movie, I felt like I was experiencing the theater performance, not just like a common movie. It's filled with beautiful images and great orchestra. Nina (Portman) is a chosen ballerina to fulfil her dual roles all at once, to be irresistible innocent white swan and also to become seductive evil black swan. Slowly but sure, the darker side of black swan absorbs her real life. I love the brilliant cinematography. Aronofsky seems to use two techniques of camera work. The first is for the long shot, he uses steady conventional method. And the second for the close up, he utilizes shaky hand-held camera. I have ever said before that hand-held camera is modern technique in today cinematic world. Not only for action, but recently for drama as well, hand-held camera is able to effectively drag you into the middle of ongoing situation, if you are not using hand-held camera, you are outdated now. The performers are effectively suitable. Vincent Cassel is fit for provocative and ambitious ballet instructor. Mila Kunis is fit for seductive and ambitious Nina's colleague. Barbara Hershey is fit for authoritarian and ambitious mother. And even a brief but impressive appearance by Winona Ryder as anxious and ambitious competitor. Yeah, it is all about the ambition and you can see it in each character. All of them have their own ambition. However, the star of all stars above is Portman. She shows her darker side successfully, you could literally feel her pain, pressure and paranoia situation. The movie becomes more mysterious with some unusual sex scenes. For the last half hour of film duration, she drives us into beautiful but ironic condition, sometimes absurdity become the part of it. Those last scenes are extremely terrifying, with broken fingernail, peeling skin and fractured bone for the elements. I almost could categorize thiz movie as a horror movie. The movie emphasizes in every beauty of ballet, there is a dark side that we never know before. Finally, I just want to say, 'It was perfect'.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",9,3,7,1 January 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," A Rousing New Adventure
","Johnny Depp is back with the most iconic role of his career, Captain Jack Sparrow. It's time to fly the pirate flag again. Thiz time, he is on a quest for the Fountain of Youth without two other main characters, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). But don't worry, it doesn't mean that thiz sequel will be less fun than the previous trilogy. They sail at almost full speed, the infamous pirates like Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and my favorite Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) are about to make a rousing new adventure. Thiz sequel is directed by Rob Marshall who is formerly known for his successful musicals like 'Chicago' (2002) and 'Nine' (2009). For the first half hour, Captain Jack's adventure is still exciting to follow, when he is captured by King George II and manages to escape. His comedy routine is still so fresh. I have to add something regarding the performance of Richard Griffiths as King George II, I love his funny face expression so much! His goofy and indolent expression is really fun to watch. The rest of the movie is pretty similar to its predecessor 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' (2003), 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' (2006) and 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' (2007). They insert unrevealed love context between Captain Jack and his seductive ex-girlfriend Angelica Teach (Penélope Cruz). Surprisingly, Cruz can fill her role quite well among these pirates. If we compare to the previous films, there is a decrease in dark and mysterious nuances that have been the characteristic of thiz franchise. Yes, we still feel thiz atmosphere when Captain Jack in Blackbeard's ship the Queen Anne's Revenge or when they are surrounded by extremely exotic and beautiful mermaids. Beside that, we won't find any more. Just like its predecessor, the story contains several subplots which may not be easy to understand. You have to put some extra efforts to comprehend the core of the story. Why they need Mermaid? What are the motives behind the involvement of Barbossa, Blackbeard and the third party Spain? Well, don't ask me. I find myself still thinking How The Black Pearl ends up in a bottle in the first place?! Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",7,0,1,31 May 2012
Men in Black 3," Will Smith in Wonderland
","There is something magnetic about Will Smith's charisma and there will always be fun atmosphere whenever he is around. If thiz guy had a nickname, it would be 'Blockbuster'. Almost all his films have reached at least $100-million mark, even in his early years, just like in 'Bad Boys' (1995) and 'Independence Day' (1996). And even more so, for me, Will Smith is Tom Cruise in black! You know what I mean. It's still about two MIB agents, one is strict and disciplined and the other one is the fun part. Yeah, Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) and agent J (Will Smith) are back! Thiz time, Agent J has to travel back to the 60s to save the life of young Agent K (Josh Brolin) from one of the most ugliest and notorious aliens that ever existed, Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement). My focus is on Josh Brolin who plays young Agent K proportionally. Josh Brolin has been a good character Actor. Thiz time, he can successfully mimic all the gestures which previously described by Tommy Lee Jones. Well, what do you expect? We're all just like Alice in Wonderland. In which we are about to see an unearthly world of freakish creatures. It follows almost exactly the same rules as its predecessors 'Men in Black' (1997) and 'Men in Black II' (2002), but only thiz time, it gets a big refresh with time-travel element. The film Producer personally requested Barry Sonnenfeld to continue directing thiz franchise and it seems they have made the right decision. Barry Sonnenfeld is the man! By the way, thiz is also the man who directed 'The Addams family' (1991) and 'Get Shorty' (1995). Once again, Sonnenfeld knows best how to play with these 'Men in Black' things. The humor, the cool gadgets, Cast members, everything in its right place. What makes a movie good? One of them is the twist at the end of the movie. And in thiz case, they also put some twist endings. Yeah, it's another alien movie, a typical Special Effects exhibition and surely predictable storyline. But hey, we laugh and it keeps us curious until the end. That's more than enough to qualify for being an entertaining movie. Since I told you quite a lot about thiz movie, now I have to brainwash you. Please see thiz light and you will forget about all the spoilers. Blitz! LOL.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",7,1,3,9 July 2012
Sucker Punch," Mega Visual Feast
","Thiz movie is my most anticipated movie of the year and ends up exactly as I expected before. It's a mega visual feast that I have ever seen since 'The Matrix' (1999). In the hand of Zack Snyder (Director), everything has reached to a new height of adrenaline rush. I'm talking about the visualization aspect here. Back in 2006 when '300' was booming, people kept questioning whether Snyder was only able to gather 300 muscular men to do those macho things? Well, now for the answer he brings us five sexy deadly ladies to fight against giant samurai and vicious dragon in alternative World War II! An innocent girl named Baby Doll (Emily Browning) is accused as a rebel and now placed in a mental hospital. In that place, she meets Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) and Amber (Jamie Chung). Together, they plan an escape route. To accomplish the mission, they have to collect five items which are a map, fire, a knife, a key and one last mysterious element. Emily Browning is perfectly Cast as Baby Doll, her character is so fragile and extremely lethal at the same time. Other Cast members worth mentioning here are Carla Gugino, Oscar Isaac, Jon Hamm and the most unforgettable appearance, Scott Glenn as the Wise Man. I love the opening scene so much which describes how Baby Doll is oppressed by her abusive stepfather, the sequence tells so effectively dramatic, dark comical and elegant. The camera movement is dynamic, the transition from one point to another is effective, and the music is perfect. Love every minute of it. For the ending, you might feel a little bit disappointed especially if you expect something more, but for me it is just perfect! The ending put us in a floating situation and makes you keep wondering even when you were walking out of the theater. I always enjoy the movie which can dive into a blur fantasy and reality world at the same time. And then explains cleverly what is the connection between them. Thiz kind of movie always utters some new hidden philosophy. Just remember, 'If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything'.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",8,5,9,2 May 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," A Lot of Kissing Coming!
","I have a question. What made you get into the line to see thiz movie in the first place? Just to see good looking faces or you want to see Edward and Bella's hot honeymoon. If that is the case then you've got it all. Finally, the end of thiz saga will be completed in thiz last chapter where the chain of major events occurs such as the wedding, Bella's pregnancy and the last battle. Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart are still in the spotlight, carrying their iconic figures. They both seem to have fun with their roles, however, their acting skills have shown either no decline or an improvement. Get ready for some mellow madness, because the story will grow more intimate. If you are a true fan of thiz franchise, you will be one of them who cheers and screams throughout the movie. You will see the marriage, the honeymoon night and yeah, a lot of kissing coming! What if you are not one of them? O ow! We've got a little problem here. You've definitely got into the wrong theater. Your nightmare is about to begin. It's pretty awkward and monotone to see the couple always flirt and pamper each other. I appreciate the first 'Twilight' (2008), there were some real romantic atmospheres there. But as time goes by, the chemistry between Edward and Bella looks even more and more overacting. Actually, it has already happened since 'New Moon' (2009) and 'Eclipse' (2010). It's Taylor Lautner as Jacob Black who gives a better performance. The other regular Cast members like Billy Burke, Ashley Greene, Jackson Rathbone, Kellan Lutz, Nikki Reed and Peter Facinelli made an exact impression of the previous movies. Three previous movies are directed by three different Directors and it happens in thiz sequel as well. Thiz time, the movie is directed by Bill Condon who is the man behind smash musical hit 'Dreamgirls' in 2006. Cutting the last part into two movies was a terrible idea in the first place. Recently, 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' (2010-2011) had done the same, dividing their final installment into two movies but in that case it looked like a reasonable idea, considering the basic materials are too thick and so much to tell. But for Twilight Saga, thiz is totally insane. They have one purpose and one purpose only, to show more kissing and cheesy scenes. One word, it's awkward!

Source Code," Oh, Boy!... It's a Pure Classic Thriller with Futuristic Details
","'I took your advice it's a very good advice', is the first words that you will hear over and over again. I always love the good movie which could generate debate and controversy among viewers. Considering all of the twists and turns, thiz is one of those. The opening scene brings us to Capt. Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up in a train. Afterwards, in front of him, a beautiful girl named Christina (Michelle Monaghan) talks to him, some detailed events, such as: the soda water splashes to his shoes, the train conductor checks up his ticket and some more, and ends up exactly 8 minutes later when the train is exploded! And then again Stevens wakes up in a capsule in the name of Beleaguered Castle, where he meets project administrator Lt. Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) along with the creator Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright). That is the first piece of our puzzle, afterwards we will be gathering piece by piece of the mystery that takes us to the new masterpiece. Gyllenhaal shows his star quality here, he can deliver the leading role very well, his confusion and integrated expression successfully brings us up and down through the story. Farmiga brings her potential talent to the maximum by delivering her investigating expression, and she looks gorgeous like always. And finally Monaghan is a good sweetener for the story. But once again the power of thiz movie is coming from the well-built story itself, promising at the first, mind-blowing for the end. It's a pure classic thriller with futuristic details, brought up by rising-up Director Duncan Jones who directed highly respected thriller ' Moon' (2009). Although there are some same repeating scenes over and over again, the storyline is actually very dynamic. After three quarters of the film, we still don't have a clue where is thiz movie going to take us. The most interesting part of thiz movie is: well, you know thiz movie brought up 'Quantum Theory' to explain things that happened. It easily reminds us of the famous 90's TV Series 'Quantum Leap' (1989-1993), where Sam Beckett (Scott Bakula) was always told to wake up in different body in every episode. Guess what? Bakula appears as a Cameo in thiz movie, although it's only his voice as Stevens's father when he speaks over the phone. And Guess what again? Some things will never change, Bakula starts the conversation with his famous line,'Oh, Boy!..'. If you didn't even realize that, I think you should see it all over again. Would you think is it gonna be 'a very good advice'?! Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",7,0,1,17 November 2011
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Matrix-Wannabe!
","I can mention at least 10 similarities between thiz film and 'Matrix' (1999)! Gun fighting Vs. a group of tactical team in a hallway, smashing into building window and firing back while it falls (with slow motion too!), bullet time technique when the villain Albert Wesker is avoiding the bullet, and even the villain character (Wesker himself) is Agent Smith look-alike! (Including the way he talks and body language) and many more. Terrible rip-off! Thiz game adaptation is a sequel of three previous movies, chronologically are 'Resident Evil' (2002), 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' (2004) and 'Resident Evil: Extinction' (2007). Paul W. S. Anderson takes back his command as Director. In my observation, Anderson is another 'Michael Bay' type of mindless popcorn Director, who always delivers mind-blowing action with extra excessive situation and seems fully unrealistic, just like what he had shown before in 'Mortal Kombat' (1995), 'AVP: Alien Vs. Predator' (2004) and 'Death Race' (2008).The brainless storyline follows Alice (Milla Jovovich) who continues to fight against Umbrella Corporation, which is now turning the world into zombieland. Like the tagline on the poster says, 'She's back and she's bringing a few of her friends', the movie is featuring all of the original characters of game version such as Claire Redfield (Ali Larter), Chris Redfield (Wentworth Miller) and Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) although she only appears as a Cameo in the ending scene. There is no such a thing called character development in thiz movie, everything is flat. It is 97 minutes with a series of slow motion sequences! One thing is for sure, on the movie like thiz you even do not have to worry during the film, because the main character will never die in any circumstances. Just prepare yourself for another carousel ride! Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",5,4,7,5 October 2010
Fight Club," No.1 Rule Is Awesome!
","I expect that Tyler Durden will be one of the most memorable characters in cult movies. 'Fight Club' is directed by David Fincher who always made a gloomy and mysterious effect in each of his movies. His famous works so far are 'Alien³' (1992), 'Se7en' (1995) and 'The Game (1997). The most important roles in thiz movie are held by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. Norton is the main character, who its name is not mentioned until the end of the movie. Pitt is Tyler Durden, the bad boy character. The other Cast members are Helena Bonham Carter and Meatloaf who is known better as a Musician. The plot is arranged well. We could see what actually happens from the beginning until the end from the innocent eyes of the narrator. The movie begins with a slow intro. In the beginning of the story, the main character is told as insomniac. But after a few incidents, he finds himself that he has some hallucination visions, in that time Tyler Durden appears. Afterward, both characters are roller-coasting all over the movie. Ever since, the story is getting excited. One of Durden's quotes is so powerful, 'The number one rule about Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club... The number two rule about Fight Club isYou do not talk about Fight Club!'. Thiz character is simply one of the best Pitt's performances since 'Twelve Monkeys' in 1995. The ending of thiz film could become the best twist ending of the decade. The movie made an amazing description about how people could really change, and even they would not realize it.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",9,1,3,17 April 2010
Inglourious Basterds," Enjoy QT's Language. Comical and Superb!
","It's very surprising for me, Quentin Tarantino (QT) picks warfare genre for his next project, although according to many sources, thiz script has been buried for a very long time in Tarantino's desk. QT is authentically an inspirational and eccentric Director at the same time. His previous best works are 'Pulp Fiction' (1994) and 'Kill Bill' (2007). It seems to me, he always finds something new to put in each of his film. The story is about a group of soldiers led by Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), who is known as 'The Basterds'. They have mission to terminate every Nazi with their fiercely sadistic way. It's also about an unfortunately Jewish girl (Melanie Laurent) who was the only survivor when Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) killed her entire family. Afterward, she runs a cinema that incidentally is rented by Nazi for their important occasion. She has a revenge plan to demolish the whole cinema with all Gestapo and Nazi superiors inside. Simply, QT never focuses on one-man-show. With his unique directing, QT takes us to his world where anything could be different. From the first chapter, we are already served by thoughtful and memorable dialogue. I think the power of QT's movie is on the dialogue, unpredicted plots, sometimes comical and filled with memorable characters in each of his movie. If you free-minded enough then you can enjoy QT's movies. Like Col. Hans Landa ever said (when he's on the farmer house at early scene), 'I ask your permission to switch to English for the remainder of the conversation' Well, let's enjoy QT's language.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",8,0,3,17 April 2010
Iron Man 2," Complete Action Package! Excellent and Entertaining!
","It is always exciting every time we watch Iron Man movie. Complete action package, great characters interest and interlude with effective humor. Tony Starks is an eccentric, self-centered but genius multi-billionaire who builds Iron Man suit. Thiz time, he faces health issue and ready to confront another thread from his business rival, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) and mysterious villain Whiplash (Mickey Rourke). In the first Iron Man two years ago, I said to everyone that Tony Starks in that movie was too humanist, which was so wrong. Starks should appear more arrogant to present his original character (If you ask me thiz kind of stuff. Well, comic is my world. I recall when my dad bought me first Iron Man's issue from overseas). But at thiz sequel, Iron Man character really fills my expectation. Robert Downey Jr. acts amazingly well, improving his first appearance. The most powerful element in Iron Man's movies is simply Robert Downey Jr. himself. Mickey Rourke is our other attention after his breathtaking performance in 'The Wrestler' (2008). He plays save for his villain character and it looks just fine. For the fight scene, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow is surprisingly kick ass. I don't know whether is the camera angle or the fight choreography that makes it so attractive, Johansson really left behind her girly image. Unfortunately, I don't like Nick Fury's character (Samuel L. Jackson) which is reconstructed from Nick Fury's original character. Other mentionable performances are Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle. The movie is directed by former Actor, Jon Favreau. His previous directing credits are 'Zathura: A Space Adventure' (2005) and the comedy 'Elf' (2003). It's almost very difficult to say thiz movie isn't a good one. Apparently it's an excellent and entertaining movie for everyone. Can't wait for another Starks Expo!

The Impossible," Powerful and Heart-Shattering Performances
","Frankly, I had been experiencing some obvious pains while watching thiz movie. The movie gives you an actual situation of one of the deadliest natural disasters of the 21st century. It was the mega tsunami that hit most of Southeast Asia in 2004. To be more specific, it's based on the incredible true story of the Belon family consists of a father, a mother and three sons, which at that time were on vacation in Phuket, Thailand. The father Henry is played by Ewan McGregor. McGregor's character went through a lot of struggles to find his wife and son. It's a very complex character. However, he can translate thiz character pretty well. But personally, for me, it's the mother Maria who is played by Naomi Watts that delivers some powerful and heart-shattering performances. Watts can bring her character to life, with great emotional depth and effective improvisation. The other strong performance comes from the role of the eldest son Lucas which is played by Tom Holland. Holland creates a brilliant chemistry with Naomi Watts. The other two younger brother Thomas and Simon are played by Samuel Joslin and Oaklee Pendergast. Thiz movie is directed by young Spanish Director Juan Antonio Bayona who previously known for 'The Orphanage' (2007). I can guarantee you will be in awe for the first 45 minutes of the movie, but after that, the storyline seems kind of lost. In addition to the impressive performances from the Cast members, thiz movie also provides breathtaking Visual Effects. It directly drags you into the middle of the situation. The giant tidal wave is frightening and believable. The sound of how tsunami debris hit and tear up the body is even more terrifying. There is always a meaning behind every tragedy. I appreciate the moral values in thiz movie. There is a scene, when the mother Maria tells her eldest son Lucas to help other victims though they themselves are in distress. It is praiseworthy deed and so amazing to see humanity is still alive. It's true, nothing is more powerful than the human spirit. That's the time when the impossible become possible.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",7,0,1,6 February 2013
Argo," When Great Script and Great Editing Are Perfectly Combined
","Generally, there are three themes that tend to be favored by award community and film critics, the winning themes are about humanity ('Schindler's List' {1993}, 'The Shawshank Redemption {1994}, 'Slumdog Millionaire' {2008}, etc.), patriotism ('Saving Private Ryan' {1998}, 'Black Hawk Down' {2001}, 'Lincoln' {2012}, etc.) and the world of cinema itself ('Cinema Paradiso' {1998}, 'Hugo' {2011}, 'The Artist' {2011}, etc.). Well, thiz movie has all three of them. Producer, Director and Actor Ben Affleck is smart enough to realize it and takes advantage of that. Ben Affleck is Tony Mendez, a CIA agent who is responsible for covert operation to extract six American embassy employees out of the rage of Iran revolutionary by pretending to be Canadian film crew. It seems that Ben Affleck has done a tremendous job as the Director. He starts with an effective prologue to provide sufficient information and every time the scene heats up, particularly when the scene of American embassy is invaded, he cleverly adds relaxing piano instrumental music to cool things down and doesn't try to provoke audience into infuriated reactions. Thiz is his third feature films behind the camera after 'Gone Baby Gone' (2007) and 'The Town' (2010). For the acting, Ben Afflecks looks cool, calm and confident. John Goodman, Bryan Cranston and Victor Garber give brief but consistent performances and the last but definitely not least, Alan Arkin creates a powerful and believable emotion as fearless Hollywood Producer. I also have to put some credit to the Production Designer Sharon Seymour who successfully makes everything look like 1980s such as costume, hairstyle, glasses, car, furniture, television, telephone, everything! How they put attention to detail is undoubtedly amazing. Personally, for me, the power of thiz movie is in the last half hour. Thiz is a good example of what you can get when great script and great editing are perfectly combined. My heart nearly stopped while watching thiz final scene which takes place in Iran airport. They use almost all aspects to create tensions from ticket, telephone, soldier, bus, you name it and they have done it. When it's over, there will be some satisfying and gratifying feelings. In the closing scene, when the camera pans over the toys of Star Wars, Planet of the Apes and other sci-fi movies one by one. It simply wants to remind us that they are not only inspirational icons in our pop culture, but also they have ever saved lives. Great movie, great story, great moviemaker!

Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Bruckheimer's Summer Trimmer!
","The name of our hero is Prince Dastan (also means hero in Persian). Dastan previously was a street rambler who was adopted by King Sharaman to live among royalty in his kingdom. And now with his mystical dagger and accompanied by enchanted Princess Tamina, he has to clear his name and finds the truth while he is falsely accused as King's murderer. Since 1989, we have known 'Prince of Persia' as a famous video game which is created by Jordan Mechner. In thiz movie, the chemistry between Prince Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton) is identical with Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley character in the trilogy of 'Pirates of the Caribbean' (2003-2007), which is also produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and Disney. In summary, they fight and they love each other. The other Cast members, Alfred Molina delivers some funny and comical moments as Sheik Amar. Ben Kingsley provides a firm performance as Dastan's mysterious uncle named Nizam. All actions (sword fighting, horse racing, arrows war, etc.) are typical action sequences in thiz kind of adventure, except the jumping scene that have become specific characteristic of 'Prince of Persia'. With slow motion and precise camera angles, thiz scene seems to work quite well. The film Director is Mike Newell, the man behind 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' (1994), 'Donnie Brasco' (1997), 'Mona Lisa Smile' (2003) and the fourth Harpot movie 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' (2005). My critics for Newell's directing is the story-telling and editing are too fast in most of the times. For the result, the character development doesn't work well. The ending is meant to be twisted. But on second thought, since he has a magical time-machine dagger, it's supposed that all problems can be solved easily, so what the conflicts are all about in the first place? All I want to say is the storyline could have been better. The plots still have many holes. With those time travel elements, they should be able to make thiz story becomes more interesting. Just like Prince Dastan once said, 'Difficult, not impossible'.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",6,5,7,2 June 2010
Ted," Crazy in A Very Good Way
","What's wrong with a teddy bear that can talk and interact with the normal world? Welcome to Seth MacFarlane's world! He is the creator behind adult TV cartoons like 'Family Guy', 'American Dad' and 'Cleveland' where dog can talk and an extraterrestrial alien as a family member. It all started when 8-year-old John Bennett made a wish that his beloved teddy bear Ted would come alive to be his best friend forever and it came true the very next day. Afterwards the scene shifts to the present day where Ted is now a bear who smoking pot and dating many girls. Meanwhile, John (Mark Wahlberg) has a job at the rental car agency and serious relationship with his girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis). Somehow, it's time for John, to choose between his best friend and his lover. My appreciation goes to Seth MacFarlane who made the script, directed the movie, voiced and motion-captured Ted. MacFarlane brings us to a whole new level of dimension that we never go before. It's sometimes weird and another time is funny. Macfarlane would do anything to create laughter, breaking all boundaries and mocking almost everyone in the industry. In short, his humor works pretty sick and well! Now, let's talk about Mark Wahlberg. All thiz time, I always think that Mark Wahlberg is always Mark Wahlberg in all of his movies. He seems only capable of delivering one same look, acting and character. But, in thiz movie, he gives me a different perspective. Eventually, Mark Wahlberg is one of the Actors who depend on his strong charisma and attractive personality. In fact, I also just realized that almost all his movies reach significant box office success. Thiz is an undeniable proof that people love him. The next in spotlight is Mila Kunis. Kunis is one true example of modern girls who can say anything she wants while still looking classy. She's not afraid to look silly. Quite the opposite, she gives the impression of smart, flexible and fun. There are also some cameo appearances involving the old aged movie star Tom Skerritt, the Jazz singer Norah Jones and Flash Gordon himself Sam J. Jones. Actually, it's quite refreshing to see a foul-mouthed teddy bear partying with 1980s sci-fi cult icon. Everything is just spiralling out of control and it seems that they are not afraid of being laughed at. Thiz is crazy in a very good way. In the end, what if I tell you that Seth MacFarlane initially intended to voice hi-tech Japanese robot cat, Mark Wahlberg was originally meant to play Nobita and the movie title should be 'Doraemon'. Well, if you believe that, then you can accept anything, including thiz movie. It's not as absurd as it sounds. Maybe sometimes the only way to stay sane is to go a little crazy ^_^ Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",8,3,6,21 January 2013
127 Hours," It was 8 Minutes of Great Music and 1 Hour 27 Minutes of Pure Thrills
","The movie is based on an autobiography book 'Between a Rock and a Hard Place' (2004) by Aron Ralston, and you can see the movie title is '127 Hours'. Without tell you any further, you can conclude yourself, he would survive after all, right? The golden question will be how did he survive? British Director, Danny Boyle is one of my favorite Directors of all-time, I note he is always good with the number on his movie titles such as '28 Days Later..' (2002) and 'Millions' (2004). After telling an inspiring story in India through 'Slumdog Millionaire' (2008), he takes us back to the United States. The incident occurred at Blue john Canyon (the Utah desert) where solitary mountaineer Aron Ralston fell into a canyon and being trapped under a boulder. Aron is played by James Franco. The movie starts with an energetic mood and spirit, plus stylish split screen and exhilarating music as well. As long as I remember, Boyle always could make an enjoyable adventure experience with his vigorously music, and thiz time he does it either. James Franco takes on responsibility for his one-man-show very well. My favorite act is when he imitates the host of 'Morning Live Show' and pretends to interview himself. He is very convincing by delivering nail-biting and captivating performances all at once, just like what Ryan Reynold did recently when he was being 'Buried' (2010). Once again, Boyle shows his capability of capturing human despair by mixing hallucination scenes and flashback sequences. Overall, it was 8 minutes of great music and 1 hour 27 minutes of pure thrills. In the end, I can assure you that Aron's experience is not simple as you think. When you are being trapped like him, it's just okay if you know you are going to survive in 127 hours ahead, maybe you can manage something to get through of that. But the real situation is not that simple, Aron didn't know for how long he would be stuck in there or even whether or not he was going to survive in that moment. Last time, Danny Boyle introduced us the exotic of Phi Phi Leh Island (near Phuket , Thailand) through 'The Beach' (2000). After that movie, thousands of people crowded that place. Thiz time, Boyle shows us the beauty of Utah Canyon, I 'm pretty sure people will go there as well. Can't wait what place he will take us next time. For precaution, before you go please tell someone where you will be going ^_^ Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",8,0,2,21 January 2011
Pirate Radio," Ultimate Rock 'N Roll!
","A tremendous Rock 'n' Roll atmosphere I've ever seen since 'Almost Famous' (2000). It feels like breaking free all rules and doing what we always desire to do. The power of thiz movie is on its Soundtracks, entire movie is filled with great passion and vintage Rock 'n' Roll music entirely. In 1960s, Rock 'n' Roll music was limited to play. BBC played less than 45 minutes rock and pop music every day. But 25 million people (almost half of Britain) were still listening silently to the Pirate Radio which its station is in a boat anchored in North Sea. There are a lot of unique and powerful characters played by talented Cast members. Personally for me, there are three important characters in thiz movie, fun and exhilarating Dave (Philip Seymour Hoffman), easy-going and free-minded boss Quentin (Bill Nighy) along with cool and charismatic Gavin (Rhys Ifans). The other Cast members also deliver some fantastic performances like Kenneth Branagh, Tom Sturridge, Chris O'Dowd and many more, plus guest star performances by Gemma Arterton and Emma Thompson. Recently, KennethBranagh is appointed to direct the upcoming Superhero movie'Thor' (2011). The involvement of different characters in thiz movie is effective and successfully balanced, which is one of the specialties of Richard Curtis as the Director. Even though Curtis is only known as the Director of a romantic comedy 'Love Actually' in 2003, his writing credits are actually superb like we have seen it in 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' (1994), 'Notting Hill' (1999), 'Bridget Jones's Diary' (2001) and several of 'Mr. Beans' TV series (1990-1995). My favorite scene in thiz movie is when Carl (Tom Sturridge) saves his father Bob (Ralph Brown) in a sinking ship. It's beautifully described with exquisite underwater scene and Steven Cat's song 'The Father and Son'. The comedy, the drama, the setting and even the outfits are astounding. It really reflects how that era occurred. If I know there was so much fun in that period of time, I would simply go there and had some great time. Long live Rock 'n' Roll music!

500 Days of Summer," The Essential of Love is the Moments We Ever Had
","The title on thiz movie, Summer eventually is the girl's name. There is no escape from love, either Tom or Summer. I think thiz is the best modern romantic drama since 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' in 2004. The couple is played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel. We have recently seen Gordon-Levitt in 'G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra' (2009). The Director is Marc Webb. The chemistry of Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel is very well. The characters seem so easy-going and believable. The movie is filled with good music to describe the highs and lows of love. The movie simply brings us into the mood of love easily, where sometimes there are laughter and joy, and the other times there are hesitation and sadness. In several scenes, they keep asking each other, 'where will thiz relationship goes to?' If you love somebody that just happens and you could tell her anytime and anywhere, it doesn't matter where the place is. Maybe it is not that simple, but we know even love doesn't last forever, but commitment does. The ending is far from idealistic, but more close to reality. Like I have said many times before, if you want to make a great love story, you cannot have the couple stay together in the ending. You have to provide the tragic element. You can see thiz fact from 'Romeo + Juliet' (1996) to 'The Titanic' (1997) and other similar love stories. The essence of love is simply the moments we ever had.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",8,0,0,17 April 2010
Dear John," Thiz Romantic Sparks
","Nicholas Sparks is the mastermind of incredibly-moving 'The Notebook' (2004). Lasse Hallström tries to tell another Sparks's novel in a movie. Recently, we have seen other Hallström's direction in heartwarming 'Hachiko: A Dog's Story' (2009). Both of them made thiz romantic drama worth it to be waited. But in the implementation, something is out of track. The story is about Savannah (Amanda Seyfried) who accidentally met John (Channing Tatum) in one fine summer on the beach. They fell in love with each other and now they have to go through a long distance relationship when John is sent away to his military mission. The Director Lasse Hallström tries to capture it with simplicity. In fact, almost all of Hallström's movies are filled with simplicity. It seems to me his simplicity made the drama comes out naturally and effectively. Richard Jenkins made a brief but incredible small role as John's father. Seyfried always looks lovable, her character is gratifying. She is able to represent up and down of all emotions very well. Once again, he shows his singing talent here. I've already fell in love with her since the first time I saw her on 'Mamma Mia!' (2008). On the other hand, Tatum's performance is awful. His character looks awkward and empty. I doubt his acting skill at all. As the result, the chemistry has a serious gap. But once again, Nicholas Sparks's novel is always worth it to be told. Thiz is fifth Sparks's novel that has adapted to movies, since Kevin Costner's 'Message in a Bottle' (1999), Mandy Moore's 'A Walk to Remember' (2002), Rachel McAdams's 'The Notebook' (2004), Richard Gere's 'Nights in Rodanthe' (2008) and also upcoming Miley Cyrus's 'The Last Song' (2010). It's always about everlasting love and long term relationship. We could spend one fine evening with anybody or even a nice whole memorable summer, it can come and go. But it's the person who always stands beside us in all these times who is truly the one.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",6,0,1,25 April 2010
The Expendables," Ultimate Action Movie!
","Would you like to see three of Planet Hollywood's former owners gather around in one scene? Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis and Sylvester Stallone make a brief reunion in thiz ultimate action movie. Stallone brings all the brawny heroes into one action package, not just the legendary ones like Mickey Rourke and Dolph Lundgren but also across generations with solid performances from Jason Statham, Steve Austin, Randy Couture and even martial arts superstar, Jet Li. Stallone who is also the Director in thiz movie, puts all of them into one battle pool. Every one of them has their own characteristic and you can see the sparkle between their interactions. Stallone gives a precise mentor performance. Although Jet Li involves into awful choreographed fight, but he delivers some fresh and effective humor. Dolph Lundgren shows how good he is with his bad boy attitude. But still, the best performance belongs to the bald Jason Statham with his cool and unmerciful expression. The story is way too simple and it feels like the plots is only a vessel for their own playground. It's what 1980s action heroes always do. Is thiz outdated? Not completely. The battle scenes still meets today's demand which is gory and brutal. For everyone of us who are action movie fans, I'm pretty sure that we have been waiting for thiz kind of classic stuff, where the dialogue is brainless but it looks cool, where only one guy can beat all the bad guys but it still looks awesome, and finally there is always a scene where the action hero has to jump out from a mega explosion behind him as an ending. It is simply a classic! But it still rocks our world. Mr. Stallone, you remind us of what we just need! By the way, do you realize what does it take to become a great action icon? Beside firm muscular body and some die-hard stunts? Well, pay attention to the specific characteristic of how the way they talk. Stallone (Italia), Schwarzenegger (Austria), Lundgren (Sweden), Jet Li (China) and Statham (England). To become a solid action icon, you will also need a unique speaking accent!

The Town," Ben Affleck is Our New Respectable Director
","If you think Ben Affleck is a great Actor, you should take a better look at 'Good Will Hunting' (1997). If you think Ben is a great Screenwriter, you should see 'The Town' more thoroughly. In thiz last movie, he also becomes the Director. For me, Ben is the third talented Actor-Director in the past decade, beside Clint Eastwood and Mel Gibson. Thiz is his second long feature after respectable 'Gone Baby Gone' in 2007. The town is Charleston Boston, where everybody knows everybody. It revolves around the bank thief Doug (Ben Affleck), his partner in crime James (Jeremy Renner), along with their former hostage Claire (Rebecca Hall) who will be having a love affair with Doug later, and a FBI agent Adam (John Hamm). All of them get tangled into a cat and mouse situation. First half of the movie, it introduces the characters and situations. Then the second half, it flips over nicely by explaining the motives behind those characters. I think Ben is success with his directing method because he does not exaggerate things up, he just let every thing flows naturally. Yes, he plays save here. The factors that empower thiz movie are simply a good script and consistent Actor performances. Ben himself shows a very calm and convincing performance. As well Rebecca Hall as his love interest, Hall delivers a precise fragile and lovable character. Jeremy Renner is deathly awesome with his street gang attitude. Most of the supporting Cast members deserve honorable mentions as well. Blake Lively as Doug's ex-girlfriend and single parent, I have never seen Lively blends into thiz kind of troubled character. Chris Cooper as Doug's behind-the-cell father, it takes only one scene but it's definitely memorable. And the last but not least for me, it's Pete Postlethwaite as Fergie the flower man who is the brain behind the crime. There is strange feeling by only hearing his intimidate and unique accent. In the end, we realize that the town could change people, and the people are just victims. It's harder to change the system than the person itself. But to change the system, it should start by changing the person as well. And thiz will be a never-ending circle. But finally, it's totally out of our control. But we can control something for sure, for me it's waiting for another Ben Afflecks's next project. I will see him again, on thiz side or the other.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",7,1,2,1 January 2011
Underworld Awakening," You Don't Need the Brain When You've Got the Gain
","What did you expect when you were buying the ticket? To see Kate Beckinsale back in tight latex outfit? You got it! To see ferocious werewolf comes to live in latest Special Effects? You got it! Or to feast your eyes with more absurd gun fighting actions? You got it too! Concisely, if you are a true fan of thiz saga, you will not have a problem to watch thiz installment one more time. It's another exact extension from the previous movies. But if you ask me, thiz movie is one of long excruciating experiences I have ever had. I mean please to be frankly honest, in every character of every scene in thiz movie, you may have some feelings about how many times you have ever seen these elements in other movies. They take a little from here and a little from that and then they put it together in one screen. It's a boring copycat movie. Everything seems so cliché. 'My Heart is not cold, it's broken'. The Duo Directors who are responsible for all of these are Måns Mårlind and Björn Stein. Previously, they are known for 'Shelter' in 2010. Beckinsale's performance as Selene has two opposite sides. On one side, she looks cool in some time. On the other side, she seems so frail and delicate. Meanwhile, the supporting Cast members like Stephen Rea, Michael Ealy, Theo James and India Eisley give typical mediocre performance. Selene the vampire knight has been fighting the lycans (werewolf) since the first 'Underworld' (2003), 'Underworld: Evolution' (2006) and one prequel 'Underworld: Rise of the Lycans' (2009). The mastermind behind thiz saga is Len Wiseman, the real life husband of Kate Beckinsale. Here is an interesting fact. In 2002, there was another couple had met and now they had become husband and wife as well. They are Milla Jovovich (Actress) and Paul W.S. Anderson (Director). They also made four installments of their own so far. It's called 'Resident Evil' (2002-2010). I have a bad hunch about thiz franchise itself. There is no doubt. Thiz 'Underworld' franchise has become a successful gold mine for the filmmakers. They will keep awakening thiz franchise as long as money keeps coming. Making matters worse, the vampires do live long! It's very clear. You don't need the brain when you've got the gain.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",4,3,6,29 February 2012
Shutter Island," Scorsese Scores Again! (Thiz Review Contains Spoiler)
","'Shutter Island' seems to be an appropriate vessel for Leonardo DiCaprio to explore his acting skill. It's quite good, but yet it's not the finest, but I still can say thiz performance might be one of his best works so far. DiCaprio collaborates the fourth time with the Director Martin Scorsese, the last three are 'Gangs of New York' (2002), 'The Aviator' (2004) and 'The Departed' (2006). Scorsese himself is a very good drama Director. His previous memorable classics are 'Taxi Driver' (1976), 'Raging Bull' (1980) and 'Goodfellas' (1990). It's about US Marshall named Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) comes to an island to investigate a mysterious case. The island is actually a prison facility for mental illness. Thiz movie is supported by heavy caliber Cast members such as Ben Kingsley, Mark Rufallo, Mark Von Sydow, Jackie Earle Haley and Michelle Williams. The script of thiz movie is very fine with several twist and turns. Scorsese with all his experiences successfully arranges every scene effectively. The exploration is classic, we even could see 'Hitchcock' atmosphere here. The Score also helps a lot to build such an intensive tension. The great example when is on the opening scene, when Daniels and his partner just arrive on the island for the first time. When they observe the surrounding that is preserved with maximum securities, the gates is opened one by one. At a glance it's just an ordinary scene, but the Score multiplies it into ten times more thrill. The twist ending is meant to be shocking. But unfortunately (Spoiler Alert!), I already see the pattern where the story might goes even in the middle of the movie. When a conversation between Daniels and Rachel (Patricia Clarkson) that takes place in a cave, Daniels said angrily, 'I am an US Marshall. No one can stop me!'. That is the first time when I clearly know that he is actually one of the patients. In the end, if we have a movie that every scene is put in for a reason. That is the time when you got yourself an effective and flawless movie. Scorsese scores again! Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",8,2,5,17 April 2010
Life of Pi," Stunning Visual Portrayal of A Spiritual Journey
","Thiz is a simple movie with stunning visual portrayal of a spiritual journey. It starts like Tim Burton's 'Big Fish' (2003) where everything is odd and magical, steps like Danny Boyle's 'Slumdog Millionaire' (2008) with its compelling flashback in storytelling and it feels like Tom Hank's 'Cast Away' (2000), only thiz time the survivor is not accompanied by Wilson the volleyball, but with something called Richard Parker. It is a courageous adventure story about a young boy named Piscine (Suraj Sharma), who unfortunately lost all his family in sinking ship. His survival effort along with all the animals, especially with a ferocious Bengal tiger, brings him to an understanding of life as a whole. The newcomer Suraj Sharma delivers a sufficient performance to describe a boy who has to survive nature. Adil Hussain and Tabu make brief but memorable appearances as Pi's father and mother. On the other hand, I think that Irrfan Khan could have been better as Adult Pi. His central role as the storyteller is just enough, not extraordinary, not even close, compared to Gloria Stuart as Old Rose in 'Titanic' (1997). Ang Lee who is formerly known as the Director of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' (2000), 'Hulk' (2003) and the controversial drama 'Brokeback Mountain' (2005), wrapping thiz movie with astonishing visual treat. 'The Storm Scene' is one of the remarkable moments in thiz movie. I bet you won't get thiz experience before in any other movies. Thiz is something that you have never seen before, followed by other scenes like 'The Giant Whale Scene', 'The Flying Fish Scene' and my favorite 'The Exotic Meerkat Island'. I think thiz movie has lots of powerful philosophies all over the place. It's like metaphor in metaphor, there comes a point in everyone's life, thiz will be something that needs to be thought about. It's emotionally gratifying. Actually, the movie is not just about survival, it's not even about the sinking ship, and it's definitely not about the tiger. It's simply about your relationship with God. In the end, we know very well. In every spiritual journey, your greatest enemy is none other than yourself.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",8,6,11,16 December 2012
Tangled," Simply Touch My Heart
","I have a friend who asked me, 'Is thiz movie worth watching?' I said, 'Go and find out yourself. It is Disney , isn't it?'. Not every year, Disney introduces us to their new Princess. It is going to be a magical time of your life, get ready to be part of the history. Do you remember how wonderful is Snow White, Cinderella, Princess Aurora the Sleeping Beauty, Ariel the Little Mermaid, beautiful Belle and the Beast, Aladdin's Princess Jasmine, Pocahontas, Mulan and last year's Princess Tiana and her Frog'? It is the time! For long-haired Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) to get out from her hidden tower, to leave her ruthless mother Gothel and has some adventures along with her Prince, errr.. I mean runaway bandit, Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi). It is also for the first time, Princess Rapunzel will face unfriendly outside world, but don't worry, she's got her frying pan to protect herself and escorted by a very cool chameleon, Pascal and the white horse with dog's capability, Maximus. The song 'When Will My Life Begin' reflects that great adventure spirit. The Directors are Nathan Greno and Byron Howard who have ever worked together in dog's tale 'Bolt' (2008). But I think the person who deserves high appreciation for bringing thiz German fairy tale comes to live is no other than Alan Menken. Menken is the regular Disney's genius Composer who can always provide delightful classic elements into every piece of his magical music or Score. The storyline is so smooth and dynamic. Yeah it is predictable, but at least you could enjoy the joyful comedy, it is always fun to watch how Rapunzel and silly Flynn Rider tease each other. And even though without dialogue, the animal characters which are the chameleon Pascal and the horse Maximus perform successful funny slapstick. For the visual pleasure, the picture is beautifully woven to a higher level, you will be amazed by how realistic each texture and detail it has been made, the hair, the grass bit by bit. The most powerful scene is 'The Floating Lanterns Scene', when finally Rapunzel and Flynn are in a boat right outside the castle, waiting for the glow flying lanterns to be released. In that romantic moment, you can feel the pure sincerity and so much loves between them through their innocence face expression and breathtaking interaction with the background song 'I See the Light'. That scene simply gives you goosebumps and could easily bring happy tears in your eyes. It is very rare that there is a movie that could touch my heart. Thiz one is definitely the one. Usually if someone asks me, 'Who is your favorite Disney's Princess?'. Most of the times, I would answer, 'Cinderella!'. But after thiz movie, maybe I would give a different answer. By the way, I always love the girl with the long hair ^_^ Disney certainly knows best! Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",9,5,8,11 December 2010
Watchmen," Best Presentation of Super-Heroes Movies So Far!
","'Watchmen' could be the best superhero movie has ever adapted from comic books, even thiz could be better than 'The Dark Knight' (2008). The Director is Zack Snyder, the man behind the extraordinary visual movie '300' (2006). He also directed the simple but effective horror 'Dawn of the Dead' in 2004. Snyder is a young Director whose his track record never flaw until now. The cinematography in thiz film is still stunning, every scene made with great details. The Watchmen's original material comes from a graphic comic which is written by Alan Moore. Every character in Watchmen is very unique. The most unique character maybe is Dr. Manhattan who is played by Billy Crudup. The other Cast members are Malin Akerman, Jackie Earle Haley, Patrick Wilson, Matthew Goode, Carla Gugino and Jeffrey Dean Morgan. 'Watchmen' tells a story about how a group of superheroes deals with the society on alternate world in 1985. One side, they are needed to maintain peace. But on the other side, they are shunned because of their oddity .The Soundtracks support very well to give a precise atmosphere during thiz movie. The conflicts are in order and proportional. In my opinion, Malin Akerman's physical appearance as Silk Spectre II is the best presentation of superhero character so far. The posture and shape how superhero should looks like is appeared perfectly. The climax of thiz movie is also very fair, where we could be blurred for defining who are the bad guys or good guys. Thiz has shown us that the movie is far mature than it looks.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",9,2,5,17 April 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," 'Wingardium Leviosa' To the Highest Level
","I almost forgot that I was watching one of the Harry Potter's movies. I feel like in a different universe compare to its predecessors. Thiz last grand epic is still directed by David Yates who was unknown Director before his involvement in the 5th film 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' in 2007. Actually, Yates has ever tried to implement thiz kind of atmosphere into the 6th film 'Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince' (2009) which is dark and gloomy with more realistic approach. But back then, it wasn't supported by attractive storyline. Thiz is the finale of J.K. Rowling's wizarding world when everything is about to end. The villain Voldermort (upss I mean You-Know-Who) gets stronger than ever. Harry Potter and his two loyal friends Ron and Hermione have to find hidden Horcruxes in order to destroy the dark lord himself. The movie starts with the doom element and dark impression everywhere, and then enters into Special Effects extravaganza, just like the previous prequels. The story as we know it before, it is centered on Harry, Ron and Hermione. Thiz chapter explores the unrevealed relationship further and for the result is something very different. I think I can see what happens here. Yates tries to lock them up alone in the same room, and then see what could possibly happen. For the first time in thiz franchise, Yates has shown us that Harry Potter's movies aren't just always about Special Effects exhibition, but also about the depth of its characters. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) has done everything he can, to show more mature emotions. Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) improves his acting better than ever. Emma Watson (Hermione) has grown up to be a beautiful and gorgeous girl. She obviously has the most promising career in the future. The heavy caliber Supporting Cast members are also in solid performances such as Alan Rickman as Prof. Snape, Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange and even Ralph Fiennes as You-Know-Who. Yates himself explores every possible technique that he could find, like flash back sequences, racking focus, bird's eye angle, hand-shake camera and even graphic animation when he reels of 'The Tale of Three Brothers'. The animation is artistic, enjoyable and mind-blowing. I ever hoped that Guillermo Del Toro ('Pan's Labyrinth' {2008} and 'Hell Boy' {2007}) would be the Director of thiz last phenomenal epic. With his resume it will be perfect! But that never happened. Each of us has been growing up with thiz franchise. The franchise itself certainly manifests being more than just the movies, but it's also becoming the part of our culture in thiz generation. It is 'Wingardium Leviosa' to the highest level, 'Expelliarmus' all the bad factors, and it surely won't be 'Obliviate' for a long time, it will be 'Lumos' brightly until the end. Can't wait to see that flat-nosed monster being defeated at the end! Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",8,0,0,25 November 2010
Hugo," What A Wonderful World of A Huge Cabaret
","When I first heard about Martin Scorsese was going to direct a family adventure movie, I said to myself I had to check thiz out! As we know before, Scorsese is a Director who is widely known for most of his gangster and violent movies such as 'Casino' (1995), 'The Departed' (2006) and 'Shutter Island' (2010). Since the opening sequence, we are spoiled with such fantastic panoramic scenery. Dynamic camera movements effectively draw you into the story in a split second, where we follow the daily life of an orphan named Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) in 1930s France. Hugo lives inside the tower clock of a crowded train station. By his curiosity, Hugo has been trying to fix an automaton in human form that his father (played by Jude Law) left him. Not long after, it takes him to Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley) with his toy booth. The premise is about the mystery behind it. Asa Butterfield, the boy who played in 'The Boy in Striped Pajamas' in 2008, seems to be a proper choice for Hugo. His sad blue eyes tell everything. Ben Kingsley also delivers a firm and attractive performance. Only after about an hour, the things become more clearly. Apparently, thiz movie tells about the magical world of movie-making. I have to underline thiz, the whole package is visually stunning! I'm amazed by its remarkable setting, the exotic lighting schemes and the exquisite cinematography. Everything at its best, everyone can tell. The story is filled with various unique characters which are played by well-known Actors, there are the adventuress Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz) who is Papa Georges's goddaughter, the grumpy station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen), the flower girl Lisette (Emily Mortimer), the kind-hearted librarian Monsieur Labisse (Christopher Lee) and still many more to mention. But if you want to be objective, most of these characters can be pushed away easily without too much ruining the main plot. I mean everyone! They are only here to become unimportant extras. Except for the station inspector, he is the only antagonist, we still need him! The character is played comically well by Sacha Baron Cohen. Without him, there will be no chasing scene and nail-biting suspense. Clearly, the main frame of the story is not that complicated at all. In fact, it's kind of flat and anticlimax. To tell you the truth, I didn't have 'The Wow Factor' for the ending. Well, I never read the book before, 'The Invention of Hugo Cabret' by Brian Selznick. So I cannot tell you whether or not, disadvantage of the story is derived from basic material. However, thiz is an award winning book, it has won Caldecott Medal in 2008. In that case, if it's true that is the whole story. What we can say Scorsese has already done one hell of a job. Hugo said, 'Movie had the power to capture dream' and Scorsese has definitely captured one perfectly. What a wonderful world of a Huge Cabaret!

Salt," Thiz Salt Is Sweet!
","'The more we run, the more they chase' is what happened to Evelyn Salt. Since Mat Damon's 'Bourne Identity' (2002) which used more advance believability approach in runaway espionage tale, now everyone tries to become Bourne by running, jumping, shooting, fighting, car chasing, motorcycle chasing, you name it and it all happens in one action package. Some examples which also using the similar patterns recently are John Travolta's 'From Paris with Love' (2009), Tom Cruise's 'Knight and Day' (2010), Ashton Kutcher's'Killers' (2010) and now it's the time for Jolie. The story follows Evelyn Salt (Jolie) who is wrongly accused as a Russian spy and now she has to clear her name by finding the invisible enemy. The Director is Phillip Noyce, the man behind 'The Bone Collector' in 1999 (also with Jolie). The camera angle is dynamic, especially in action sequences. Yes, the movie is filled with twists and turns, even sometimes the story just goes by itself without proper explanations, leaving too many questions and missing links. That is uniqueness of the plots! The story effectively draws our curiosity. It is success to make us stay put in our seat by expecting what is going to happen next. To let Jolie fuses into action adventure like thiz is just like releasing the fish into water, it's simply what she does best. Jolie is still in the spotlight, shines among her mysterious partner (Liev Schreiber) and strict boss (Chiwetel Eijiofor). If someone complains about how absurd thiz narratives has become, it's simply arguable and it all happens to every modern action movies nowadays. One thing for sure, Jolie is back with some killing moves to remind us that she is still one of the favorite action heroines in our time. Thiz 'Salt' is sweeter than you think it is.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",7,1,4,4 August 2010
Shrek Forever After," Cat-tastrophe, ri-Donkey-lous and un-Shrek-able!
","What is the first reason that makes you go to see Shrek? For me, I expect cheerful atmosphere all over, that simple! In thiz fourth installment of Shrek, everything becomes darker and gloomier. I think the key factor that made Shrek franchise so successful all these times is Andrew Adamson. Adamson was the Director of two early ones 'Shrek' (2001) and 'Shrek 2' (2004). And he also contributed writing credit in 'Shrek the Third' (2007). Thiz time to continue thiz three years occasion without his involvement, Shrek is just about get into the nightmare. The directing is handed to Mike Mitchell. Mitchell is previously known as the Director of 'Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo' (1999) and 'Sky High' (2005) which are not animation features. The story tries to reset everything from the beginning. It tells Shrek (Mike Myers) travels to the past and faces the new alternate universe, where Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) is a warrior, Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) now is a fat lazy cat, and Donkey (Eddie Murphy) doesn't even know Shrek at all. All happens because of a bad intention of a new villain named Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn) who has an ambition to rule Far Far Away Kingdom. Thiz character is not developed well. The only funny moment is only when he eventually changes his silly wig. It's not comparable to Lord Farquaad's character in the first 'Shrek'. If we look back the Shrek series in overall, it has been already downhill since the second one. The first 'Shrek' was amazingly fun, 'Shrek 2' was still impressive and we had ever thought that 'Shrek the Third' would be a real forever after. I describes thiz one as no need extension. However, Shrek movies always are filled with joyful Soundtracks. If only they have a fresh idea, they can continue thiz franchise, but if they don't, please just left thiz franchise behind for a little while. The thing is they don't realize that they may kill thiz franchise forever after. One thing is for sure, thiz one really becomes a 'Cat-tastrophe' and 'ri-Donkey-lous' movie.",5,4,12,26 May 2010
The Amazing Spider-Man," Spidey Is Spicy Than Ever!
","Spidey is spicy than ever! Ready or not, here he comes. They take Spider-Man to 'The Dark Knight' (2008) level. Darker! More realistic! And more serious! But don't get me wrong, thiz rebooted version has its own original style and identity. I hate to compare thiz one to the previous Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy (2002-2007) but I have to say something here. I have been a comic fan since I was a little boy. I'm certainly not a fan of the previous version. In fact, I have lots of disappointments and even more tons of complaints about it. I remember when the movie came out, I said to everyone, 'Why they made Peter Parker to be some kind of Clark Kent's character? The eye color should be hazel instead of blue. Peter Parker has thiz slang language thing, some kind of skateboard boy look-alike, and he is surely not geeky!'. Well, they make up for it thiz time. 'The Amazing Spider-Man' has better costume, better camera angles and even better hairstyle. Thiz is what Peter Parker should look like! Andrew Garfield is definitely a better Peter Parker, Garfield reveals the dark side of thiz character and it looks just amazing and humble at the same time. Emma Stone is solid as a rock, another perfect choice to represent Peter's first true love Gwen Stacy. The Director Marc Webb creatively spreads his web all over these two characters. You can see there is something there between the interaction of Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy. There is a beautiful chemistry and sincere love between them! Just exactly what he has shown us in '(500) Days of Summer' (2009). The supporting Cast members also look amazing, Sally Field and Charlie Sheen as Aunt May and Uncle Ben, Denis Leary as Gwen's father Captain George Stacy and Rhys Ifans as Dr.Curt Connors and his alter-ego The Lizard. And guess what? I think Marvel comic book creator Stan Lee finally makes his best cameo ever in thiz movie when he's just listening to music on his headphones in the library fight scene. I'm also fascinated by how they pay homage not only to comic version but also to previous Spider-Man's movies, Spoiler Alert! Only if you realize there's a scene when Uncle Ben advises Peter, there is kind of 'With great power comes great responsibility' thing but in different words. And there is also a scene when Spider-Man has to choose to save a car from falling off a bridge or chase the bad guy. It simply makes everybody happy. I notice that they keep the Lizard's figure to remain mysterious for almost half the length of the film and suddenly boom! The full appearance of Lizard comes out and it's so frightening. Whether you realize it or not, most of the Spider-Man's action scenes take place at night. There are a lot of night scenes, more than ever. It makes thiz version even more mysterious. I love how they capture those famous Spider-Man swingings with roller-coasting camera angle, it looks wow! And those Spider-Man's cheesy lines just like in comics, 'Hey, I'm swinging here, I'm swinging here!', 'If you're going to steal cars, don't dress like a car thief' or 'Please shut your mouth, reptile.. Upss!'. That's the real Spider-Man! Well, One more thing to spoil. I just want to say, at the end Spider-Man makes one great pose.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",8,1,4,9 July 2012
No Strings Attached," You FELL When No Strings Attached
","There are only two reasons you go to watch thiz movie. First bcoz of 'Black Swan' (2010), you want to see Natalie Portman! Or you're one of those who think Ashton Kutcher is cute! The story follows Adam (Kutcher) and Emma (Portman) who are friends since childhood. Somehow they promise to use each other for physical reason which is sex! It's exactly what Anne Hathaway did with Jake Gyllenhaal recently in 'Love and Other Drugs' (2010). They want sex, but in the process to that they find something more special. Kutcher has fun and easy-going character (where he did just well most of the time). On the other hand, Portman gives a balancing to their interaction. It's good, not bad at all for sure, but it's like using big Bazooka to kill a little bird, completely waste of talent. The movie comes from the Director who is the father of 'Ghostbusters' (1984) and Arnie's 'Kindergarten Cop' (1990). The fun factor is still on the air for about half hour of the beginning, we could still feel the excitement and freshness, afterwards the movie becomes a never-ending boredom. In my note, what happened to modern Rom-Coms nowadays, it's almost impossible, making movie without raising Gay Issues. For example in thiz movie, one of Portman's best friends is gay, and so with one of Kutcher's best friends also has gay parents. Another factor that occurs to most of modern Rom-Coms lately is the use of vulgar words and irreverent dialogue, it's totally unbearable, including thiz one. By the way, if you came to see Portman being naked in the first place. Well, instead of that, you get Kutcher being naked! It's pretty ugly for the one who expects more. One good evidence of the situation that describes you fell when no strings attached.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",5,0,2,14 March 2011
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Thiz Movie Deserves to Receive 1Up and 1000 Combos!
","What is the password? Umm... Whatever! That is the attitude of 23-year-old Scott Pilgrim. By watching thiz film, amazingly I feel like back to become a teenager again with my skate board under my feet and baseball cap on my head. It tells about Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) who has a new girlfriend, Ramona Flower (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Now, he must defeat Ramona's seven evil ex-boyfriends in video game style duels. Meanwhile, Scott plays in a band called Sex Bob-omb with his friends. The movie is directed by Edgar Wright who brought us 'Shaun of The Dead' (2004) and 'Hot Fuzz' (2007). He is always able to make any comedy to look smart but it's also funny at the same time. On thiz latest feature, there are some unique and hilarious characters such as Scott's gay roommate Wallace (Kieran Culkin), Scott's annoying ex-girlfriend Knives (Ellen Wong) and Ramona's Indian silly ex-boyfriend Matthew Patel (Satya Bhabha). Even more, the movie is surrounded by fresh Cameo appearances from Anna Kendricks, Jason Schwartzman, Chris Evans, Thomas Jane and our last 'Superman' Brandon Routh. Michael Cera seems to be a perfect choice for Scott Pilgrim. He does not even have to act so hard to become thiz character. Mary Elizabeth Winstead also delivers a believable character with some punk girl attitudes. The movie is based on the first three series of six black-and-white comic strips by Bryan Lee O'Malley. The Art Direction is very attractive and colorful. They use comical fonts to emphasize the sound and the fighting scene is one of the main attractions. Most of the fight scenes are mind-blowing with those graphics and animations. Yeah it looks ridiculous sometimes, but surely it is well choreographed. Once again, the only way to comprehend thiz movie is by letting yourself being young again. Thiz movie reminds us of how we enjoyed adolescence by living in our own world. Once in awhile, all of us were Scott Pilgrim and there was only us Vs. the world. For me, thiz movie deserves to receive 1up and 1,000 combos!

Mamma Mia!," Splendid Modern Musical
","It's another musical movie. Thiz movie is a tribute to ABBA, the famous disco sensation in 1970-1980s. It's a simple story about a girl who wishes his father presence on her wedding day. The problem is she doesn't actually know who her father is. She has been raised by her mother alone. According to her mother diary, there are three possibilities that are represented with three persons that could be her father. The things become complicated when she finally decides to invite them all. You just can't imagine what will happen next. The movie is starred by a lot of senior Actors such as Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgård and Colin Firth. Apparently, the surprise comes from a promising rising Amanda Seyfried. She delivers her role with easy-going and lovable character. The ABBA's hits like 'Honey', 'Dancing Queen' and 'Mamma Mia!' are performed well by the Actors and Actresses themselves. In my opinion, the songs are successfully refreshed. On top of that, I think nowadays musical movies become more acceptable. It begins to sound familiar because the music is more likely to base on pop rock trends. It's very different from musical movies that made from 1950-1960s which were mostly based on classic orchestra. The movie is surprisingly directed by first time Director, Phyllida Llyod. In overall, the movie is so fresh and full of joys. Before I went to watch thiz movie, I thought it would be another teen movie. But after I have seen it, I come to the conclusion that thiz movie is simply enjoyable and fun for all ages.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",7,1,2,17 April 2010
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Thiz Is A Journey That You Want To Take
","To be honest, at first I was a little reluctant to spend almost three hours to see thiz movie but I know I will go anyway, just for curiosity's sake. However, it ends up with 'Wow!'. Thiz movie serves as a prequel to Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy consists of 'The Fellowship of the Ring' (2001), 'The Two Towers' (2002) and 'The Return of the King' (2003). The tale starts with a comfortable pace and very good peaceful feeling by showing the beautiful Hobbit Village. I'm surprised that some scenes are almost too simple and humble for epic like thiz. Don't get me wrong, I love thiz part very much! There is a cameo appearance from Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and it's also about how they introduce young Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and the uninvited thirteen dwarfs one by one. It's not quite as grand as the previous trilogy, it's merely simpler, but surely has heart in it. For me, Peter Jackson is another George Lucas with his Middle-earth universe. Jackson really knows for sure about how every single thing should look like. His attention to detail both visible and unseen is remarkable. Thiz movie is very neat and well-arranged. You almost can't find a single hole or mistake. Everyone takes their role proportionally. Martin Freeman delivers his central figure with depth as Bilbo Baggins. Richard Armitage shows a precise charisma as the dwarf leader Thorin Oakenshield . Ian McKellen brings his presence with wisdom as the powerful wizard Gandalf. And plus the minor parts but memorable ones like Christopher Lee as the white wizard Saruman, Hugo Weaving as the mighty elf-lord Elrond and Cate Blanchett as the beauteous elf Galadriel. All three of them look younger and divine than ever. And last but certainly not least, the dirty creature Smeágol finally comes out and perhaps it would be the most awaited scene for the fans. Just like in the previous movies, thiz character is amazing! I almost can say, Smeágol (also known as Gollum) might have delivered the best acting for overall, not because the other Actors are bad, but you can see it yourself, the complex emotion and sound are very convincing. The man behind it is Andy Serkis. There are so many similar adventures have been made before, but only a few like thiz J.R.R. Tolkien's legendarium that is definitely beyond imagination. Everything is bigger than anything. It's like creating a whole new world in a whole new way. It's a great basic material as a novel in the first place and it's even a greater presentation as a movie. In summary, thiz movie is worth watching even if you're not a fan. Thiz is a journey that you want to take.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",8,2,10,1 January 2013
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Enjoyable Pure Action Movie
","Light the fuse! Ethan Hunt was the one who ignited the fuse. What I remember most from Ethan Hunt's character is that he was the man who killed Jim Phelps! Yes, 'Mission: Impossible' (1966-1973) was a successful intelligent TV show, Jim Phelps (originally played by Peter Graves) was the leader of thiz highly sophisticated covert team, his charismatic presence had already become a trademark for thiz franchise. Then suddenly, in 1996, Tom Cruise who coming from nowhere, bought thiz franchise and killed Jim Phelps and replaced it with himself as the invincible super whiz named Ethan hunt. At that time, I was very mad and I thought all the fans would do the same. But now, after three previous movies 'Mission: Impossible' (1996), 'Mission: Impossible II' (2000), 'Mission: Impossible III' (2006), including thiz last one, they seem to gradually transform thiz franchise to be a pure action movie, even though still with ultra-cool high tech gadgets. Not just the attractive gadgets, but also high-octane adrenaline stunts, just like thiz time Tom Cruise attempts to climb the world's tallest building ever made so far, Burj Khalifa in Dubai. I heard that most of the dangerous stunts were done by Cruise himself. Thiz time, Ethan Hunt forms a smaller team comprising sexy, seductive and extremely lethal Jane Carter (Paula Patton), humorous computer genius Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and the mysterious co-agent William Brandt (Jeremy Renner). Its mission is to retrieve the nuclear launch codes before it gets into the wrong hands of international terrorists. In the process, instead, they are accused of masterminding the Kremlin bombing. Now the IMF is disavowed and they are forced to invoke Ghost Protocol, which means they are all alone with the limited resources they have. The Director is Brad Bird who is most renowned as one of the fathers of Pixar animation studios. Thiz is his first live-action movie after successful animations like 'The Incredibles' (2004) and 'Ratatouille' (2007). By the way, in 2012, Brad Bird's other colleague Andrew Stanton also will be directing another live-action movie entitled 'John Carter'. Coincidence? Maybe. I have to admit that thiz movie has consistent paces since the first minute. I note that Tom Cruise repeats at least three specific actions that he has done in previous movies. The first is running from an explosion behind him, the second is climbing the iconic skyscrapers and the last one is taking cover when he is almost crushed by a car! Although it's a kind of repetition, but oh yeah we still enjoy so much.As time goes by, it seems to be 'Mission: Impossible' has transformed into pure action movie! The only thing left now is its famous instrumental theme song, or maybe the latex face mask, you must know what I mean. Other than that, thiz movie has always been Tom Cruise's playground. Personally, I'm just OK with that, as long as thiz franchise can maintain its winning formula which is non-stop explosive action scenes. That's all from me. Thiz review will self-destruct in five seconds. Goodluck, Ethan.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",7,1,3,15 May 2012
2012," Mega Apoclypse from Master of Apocalypse
","It's just like I predicted before, '2012' will be a controversial movie. If we talk about the end of the world, the issue about religions is avoidable. Thiz movie itself starts with significant Box Office worldwide. People come to the theaters to fulfil their curiosity, to see how the world will end. Thiz is totally just theme victory. The Director is Roland Emmerich, who I called 'The Master of Apocalypse'. Before '2012', Emmerich has several times brought the topic about the end of the world, just like in 'Independence Day' (1996), 'Godzilla' (1998), 'The Day After Tomorrow' (2004) and '10.000 BC' (2008). The movie is starred by John Cusack who finally gets his big budget movie. The other Cast members are Chiwetel Ejiofor, Woody Harrelson and Danny Glover. As we know the genre like thiz will be a spectacular Special Effects exhibition. The most powerful scene is when John Cusack's character is driving his car and chased by earthquake. The great thing about thiz movie is some scenes bring out the humanity theme as well. On the contrary, I'm surprised that '2012' is lack of environmental issue. Previously, I thought they would put a lot of environmental issues into the movie. '2012' just delivers a great description about the end of the world. The truth is nobody knows when it will happen, except our Creator.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",7,2,2,17 April 2010
Kick-Ass," Rude, Brutal and FUN !
","When you were just a kid, did you ever wish to be a superhero? I think all the kids who were born in 1980s onward would ever desire about that, at least once. Thiz movie is very confident since the beginning, they advertise it rapidly and the posters are very attractive as well. It's about Dave (Aaron Johnson), an unpopular and nerdy boy who wants to be a superhero even without super power. He tries to save the world with the alter-ego named Kick-Ass, to do otherwise he get his ass kicked. Meanwhile, there are Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and her eleven-year-old daughter named Hit-Girl (Chloë Grace Moretz) who have been the real superheroes, fighting the crime against drug dealer mob Frank D'Amico (Mark strong). Frank attempts to put his son, Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) as undercover superhero named Red Mist, his intention is to capture Kick-Ass. Aaron Johnson delivers standard performance. Nicolas Cage provides a strong and comical figure. It's Chloë Grace Moretz who surprises us with believable and easy-going performance. Hit-Girl's fight scene is one of the awesome moments (we know that she's probably replaced by stunt double, but it's still awesome!), furthermore she is also good in drama.Once again, Mark Strong successfully brings an interesting villain character. Recently, he was also a bad guy in 'RocknRolla' (2008), 'The Young Victoria' (2009), 'Sherlock Holmes' (2009) and 'Robin Hood' (2010). In every occasion, he could deliver different bad guy character with his aura and I admire him for that. In fact, I will officially give him appreciation as 'Bad Guy of the Year'. The Director is Matthew Vaughn who directed 'Stardust' (2004) and the respectable 'Layer Cake' (2007). Actually on thiz movie, the conversation is a little bit rude (as family movie) and the fight scene is kind of bloody brutal, but we have to admit the story is original and effectively hilarious. The movie is brave enough to challenge the mainstream and it works well in most of the times. In my point of view, when we dare enough to laugh on ourself for our own stupidity or feebleness, that's the time we actually show the big heart of us.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",7,1,9,15 May 2010
The Hurt Locker," Pace Our Adrenaline
","I think hand-held camera has become a modern technique in nowadays cinema. Thiz movie utilizes a lot of those shaky-camera techniques. The cinematography is displayed with no specific tone and color. What we are about to see is precisely like what we are going to see through our naked eyes. I realize that they may just want to capture things as realistic as they could. But is that effective? Personally for me, I don't like it at all. The conventional movie makers have been trying to brush their pictures into some kind of atmosphere. There is art there. If we let everybody treats all movies like thiz movie. I think anyone can make a movie as long as they have their expensive digital camera. The movie is played by the second class Actors which the most proportions go to the two main characters, Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie. Nothing is special on their performances. The other Cast members are Brian Geraghthy, Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, David Morse and many more. The story itself doesn't contain main plot. The only thing that I appreciate in thiz movie is how they make the action scenes. Most war movies rely on big battle scenes with 'Big Boom Bang', exactly what we have seen in 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998) and 'Black Hawk Down' (2001). But thiz movie uses what I called 'The Horror Formula'. The scenes try to create the tension by putting nice built waiting moments into its action scenes. Some scenes successfully pace our adrenaline. The movie is directed by Kathryn Bigelow who previously directed 'Point Break' (1991) and 'K-19: The Widowmaker' (2002). In overall, it is not a great warfare movie ever made, if we compare to the legendary war movies like 'Apocalypse Now' (1979) or 'Full Metal Jacket' (1987). But I have to say that I fully support woman Directors to direct thiz kind of genre.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",6,0,4,17 April 2010
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Good-looking Boys and Girls Parade
","'New Moon' is the second constellation of Twilight Saga which is written by Stephenie Meyer. The movie is still played by the regular Actors from the prequel such as Robert Pattison and Kristen Stewart. Plus brand new Cast members like Taylor Lautner and Michael Sheen. Pattison plays as a charismatic vampire named Edward who falls in love with a girl named Bella (Stewart). We have seen Pattison few years ago in 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' (2005) as Harry's competitor. The former Director of 'Twilight' (2008), Catherine Hardwicke is now replaced by Paul Weitz. Hardwicke's version of 'Twilight' was filled with more romantic atmospheres. She was undoubtedly success to build the chemistry between two main characters. On the contrary, Weitz doesn't get into the right track to create such emotions. At the beginning, I think whoever the Director of thiz second movie should have more chance to create attractive plots, considering the conflicts will become intense based on original contents. The other weakness of thiz movie is on the action sequences. The actions sequences may be supported by more Special Effects but the actions are clearly too brief in most of the times and it surely doesn't create even a single memorable thrill. We remember the first 'Twilight', the scene when Edward came to save Bella from a bunch of bad guys or the fight scene in a baseball field. The only scene that I like on thiz movie is when Bella has a dream about her grandmother in a beautiful forest. In that scene, suddenly Edward appears and Bella realizes later, that is not her grandmother but it is herself getting older in Edwards's arms. It's a good metaphor to reflect the problem that they are facing.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",6,1,2,17 April 2010
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," ClassicThriller with Modern Content
","The Novelist Stieg Larsson died in 2004, where none of his 'Millennium' trilogy has been published yet. There was a tragic story that I found behind the making of those books. When Larsson was 15 years old, he witnessed the gang rape of a young girl. He never forgave himself for failing to help that poor girl at that time. The girl name was Lisbeth. Thiz movie is the first adaptation of those trilogy books. Sometimes I find myself enjoying so much pleasure by watching European movies like thiz Scandinavian movie. The movie is filled with splendid cinematography. I have ever thought that High Definition (HD) Camera would not be able to accomplish thiz kind of remarkable views. I was wrong, many nowadays Directors are still able to create a great nuance with precise treatment through their HD Cameras, sometimes even better. The movie is directed by Niels Arden Oplev. The story tells about the troubled journalist Mikael Blomkvist has to work side by side with a genius punk Gothic hacker, Lisbeth Salander in order to solve a mystery about a missing young girl named Harriet, for the event that had occurred 40 years ago, upon the request of a billionaire industrialist, Henrik Vanger. I have to mention that Sven-Bertil Taube has made a solid performance as Henrik Vanger. Michael Niqvist is very convincing to create his dual side character as Mikael Blomkvist. And surely, the most memorable performance belongs to Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander. I realize that those characters are so difficult to play especially for the two main characters, Blomkvist and Salander because of their complicated motives and backgrounds. I simply called thiz movie as classic thriller with modern contents. Classic which makes us pays attention to clue by clue to get closer to the hidden villain. It is what classic thrillers do. Modern which floods with audacious elements such as the anti-hero characters, ironical sexual abuse scene, unusual moral conflict and many more. I heard that next year, they will remake thiz movie into Hollywood version. My opinion is don't expect too much, even though the Director will be David Fincher who is capable to translate dark tone into intriguing crime thrillers like thiz, he had already proved that through 'se7en' (1995), 'Fight Club' (1999) and 'The Zodiac' (2005). The newest James Bond, Daniel Craig will be the main figure as Mikael Blomkvist and Rooney Mara ('The Social Network' {2010}) will be played as Lisbeth. I think no matter how hard they will try. Thiz Swedish movie has already set up the bar so high and seems undefeated at thiz time.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",8,1,3,6 December 2010
Clash of the Titans," Sometimes What We Saw in Movie-Trailer is What We Saw in Entire Movie
","Thiz movie is a remake from the original version in 1981 which was still using stop motion techniques. Now on CGI era, 'Clash of The Titans' is resurrected back to live. Perseus used to play by Harry Hamlin, now is replaced by Sam Worthington. The Director is Louis Leterrier, the creator of 'The Transporter' (2002) and 'Incredible Hulk' (2008). I note that there are three mega actions which are giant scorpion battle, Medusa hunt and the unleashed kraken scene. The Special Effects work just fine. But for the close up fight scenes, the camera doesn't seem to focus and too fast, we even don't know what is really going on. The dialogue is a little bit lame and lack of interlude humor. The two opposite titans, the heaven king Zeus and the dark lord Hades are played very well by Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes. However, I like the Gods gathering at Mount Olympus as shown in thiz film. It is better and way beyond of what we have seen previously in 'Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief' (2010) which is also based on Greek mythology. My school teacher used to say, 'Sometimes what we saw in movie-trailer is what we saw in entire movie'. It really happens to thiz film. It's not the best of Worthington, comparing to his latest performances in 'Terminator Salvation' (2009) and the ground-breaking 'Avatar' (2009). There is emptiness during his appearance in thiz movie. Anyhow, I think we will see more of his movies in the coming years. Thiz man could be a new Schwarzenegger. It looks like we've got a new titan in Hollywood.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",7,1,1,16 April 2010
The Dark Knight," We Take It So Serious!
","It has been three years after the prequel 'Batman Begins' (2005). 'The Dark Knight' is the sixth film that brings Batman into widescreen since Tim Burton's 'Batman' (1989). The Director is still Christopher Nolan who is previously known for his unique indie film 'Memento' in 2000. The movie breaks the all-time Box Office records. It has earned more than one billion dollars in worldwide and has already passed 'Titanic' Record in 1998. The movie is based on Frank Miller's version of Batman, which is more mature and believable. Christian Bale is Bruce Wayne. Thiz role seems to be a big leap of his career since his first appearance as an innocent kid in Steven Spielberg's war movie 'Empire of the Sun' in 1987. 'The Dark Knight' is also starred by regular Cast members like James Cain, Morgan Freeman and Maggie Gylenhall who replaces Katie Holmes's character in the previous movie. The best of all is Heath Ledger who delivers his last performance as the eternal enemy of Batman, Joker. The other villain is played amazingly well by Aaron Eckhart as Two-Face. Nevertheless, if they want to show original Joker's character as in its comic, in my opinion the dream Cast would be Adrien Brody or Jim Carrey. The Script is nicely arranged by Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan Nolan. The storyline is dynamic and unpredictable. The action is on the right track, is filled with 'Bat' equipments and car chase showdown. It's a good movie to watch, it's simple and explosive at the same time. I think that if we want to be fair, we also have to give high appreciation to Tim Burton's 'Batman' which has already set up an impressive tone for other next Batman movies or even other Superhero movies later. Burton successfully provides a new acceptable point of view for thiz kind of genre. The tone is dark, mysterious, and full of believable characters and environments.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",8,1,4,17 April 2010
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Mesmerizing
","Have you ever in love so deeply and suddenly you have to break up? That's the feeling you will get from watching thiz movie. The feeling is about how you fall in love with a girl and later you realize that time will never come back again. It is starred by Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Mark Rufallo and Kirsten Dunst. The movie is directed by French Director, Michel Gondry. Gondry always brings some absurd stories for his movies like in 'The Science of Sleep' (2006) which I also like very much. The story is about dreaming the past but only you can actually feel it as it just happens at the present time. Sometimes it happens based on what you remember. Thiz is an interesting part, at one of the scenes the two characters (Carrey and Winslet) have interaction with each other and then they are surrounded by people who have blank faces, because Carrey's character don't remember how the people look like, so the scene describes those people with blank faces. The Director is so lucky to get Carrey and Winslet in appropriate time, Carrey who just desperately wants some serious drama beside his comedian roles, and Winslet wants to prove her true acting skill after 'Titanic' (1997). Thiz movie doesn't contain an extraordinary storyline, but surely it can reflect the description about how the event happens.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",9,0,4,17 April 2010
Alice in Wonderland," Following The White Rabbit into the Hole?!
","Finally, I went to see 'Alice in Wonderland', the movie that I had been waiting for such a long time. The tale is about 19-year-old Alice following the white rabbit, to find her destiny back to Wonderland that is now ruled by Red Queen. The movie is directed by Tim Burton, the man who specializes in eye candy and delight visualization. Thiz movie is the seventh collaboration with Johnny Depp as his main performer, after 'Edward Scissorhands' (1990), 'Ed Wood' (1994), 'Sleepy Hollow' (1999), 'Charlie and The Chocolate Factory' (2005), 'Corpse Bride' (2005) and 'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street' (2007). His other masterpiece features are 'Beetle Juice' (1988), 'Batman' (1989) and 'Big Fish' (2003). Thiz movie is supported by various Cast members like Anne Hathaway, Crispin Glover, Michael Sheen, Alan Rickman and Mia Wasikowska as Alice. The most powerful performance in thiz movie is 'Big Head' Red Queen character, which is played amazingly wicked and funny at the same time by Helena Bonham Carter (it's about the same character on Lord Farquaad in first 'Shrek' {2001}). Bonham Carter's performance exceeds Depp's appearance. Her existence saves the movie for overall. Beside that I do not feel any emotions on thiz film, everything is flat. Actually, thiz movie isn't supported by a good script. It could be the worst script that ever came to Tim Burton's desk in these past twenty years of his career. Nevertheless, the visualization is A-Class. The story is an alternate version of the original 'Alice in Wonderland' (written by Lewis Caroll). Thiz version doesn't carry such a thrill and interesting plots. At the final scene (Spoiler Alert!), give Alice a sword and knight armor to slay a dragon? It's definitely not a good option. The change is too radical, soft and tender Alice that is built from the beginning suddenly takes an incisive turn over. The flip over is so hard that possibly has become its own boomerang itself.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",7,4,7,17 April 2010
Avatar," Blueman Rocks!
","Ten years after 'Titanic', People have been waiting for James Cameron's next project. 'Avatar' is Cameron's ambitious project to explore the Special Effects better than ever. From his filmography such as 'Aliens' (1986), 'Terminator' (1984), 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' (1991), 'True Lies' (1994) and 'Titanic', we should never doubt Cameron's resume. In 1997, 'Titanic' won 11 Oscars, to be equal with 'Ben-Hur' (1959) as all-time best achievement in Academy Awards. Cast members of 'Avatar' are Sam Worthington, Michelle Rodriguez, Giovanni Ribisi, and Sigourney Weaver (who has already become iconic tough woman character in Cameron's 'Aliens'). Thiz movie has a unique story that reflects the originality of the script. While we are watching 'Avatar', we will not realize that 90% of the movie is actually animation. The technology itself has reached the new level of movie-making. They have already set up the bar so high to challenge in the coming years. The stunning moment that I like to watch over and over again is the night scene of forest landmark. The forest description is filled with the glowing unique plants. There's something exotic and beautiful about that scene. The best thing I love about 'Avatar', it contains strong environmental issue. In my opinion, Thiz movie also has tremendous hidden philosophies inside. It's all about human need, environmental effect and human heart. Like I have said before, 'Open your eyes, the dream is over. Close your eyes, it's still a dream'. The Blueman rocks! Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",8,2,4,17 April 2010
The Artist," Speechless....................................
","Speechless... is one word to describe thiz movie. It has been proved that you don't need expensive Actors or famous Director to make a terrific movie. The movie is presented like an old time silent movie, it is black and white, almost no conversation and even was shot in the 1.33 : 1 aspect ratio. It takes place in 1927, when George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) was the king of silent movies. An unexpected encounter with the young and lovely rising star Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo) takes him to the mutual delight adventure in film industry. Every Actor plays its role perfectly, main or supporting. Jean Dujardin performs a superb and flawless acting. His charisma is unquestionable central element. He's got the eye gaze, the eyebrow raise, the eyelash flutter, the dancing, everything that knocks down the game entirely. His opposite love interest, Bérénice Bejo creates an equal presence. Maybe she's not the most of gorgeous blonde girl figures, but she is positively charming in every way. Other roles by John Goodman, Penelope Ann Miller and James Cromwell as a loyal butler and even the dog are proportionally fit as they need to be. The plot is perfectly told. Although it is a black and white silent movie, every minute that you spend, it will not make you bored at all. The selection of musical Score is vital. Music is the life of thiz movie. It flows up and down dynamically during the mood changing in every scene. The man behind the curtain is Michel Hazanavicius, the under radar and unknown Director takes the risk to do something completely different and it seems to be perfectly pay off. I have to say that the conflict issue is brilliant! It is a solid winning theme. If you are an Actor or someone who is involved in thiz industry, you will surely appreciate the message behind thiz movie. It is a Golden Gate that bridging the intergenerational gap. Silence is golden, my friend! Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",9,1,4,24 February 2012
How to Train Your Dragon," Another Feel-Good Movie
","What is so special about animation? Since all the camera angles, character expressions and body languages are fully controllable by the filmmaker, the result is all animation movies are fun to watch. So it's very hard for me to criticize it. Thiz kind of movie depends on the whole divisions without exception. The credit does not just belong to Director. Thiz movie is directed by Disney's 'Lilo and Stitch' (2002) creators, Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders. The characters are voiced by Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, Jonah Hill and America Ferrera. A Viking boy named Hiccup (Baruchel) is learning how to become a warrior. One day, instead of vanquishing the dragon as he told to, they end up being friends. The dragon character which named Toothless has a unique figure but still lovable. Yes, it's entertaining but still on standard formula. The story relies on what I called 'Zero to Hero' formula. The main character is mostly described as a nerd type and later becomes a savior for his people. The best part of thiz film is the flying scene which is so thrilling and exciting. Yes, it's another CGI animation. Yes, it's another feel good movie.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",6,2,10,17 April 2010
Limitless," Bradley Cooper and His Awesomeness
","Thiz movie is definitely my personal favorite from 2011. What if one pill could create the perfect version of you? Yes, Thiz one pill could raise the hidden potential of our brain. We become aware of every single detail, creativity and problem-solving will eventually burst out and certainly math becomes useful. It happens to Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper), a desperate writer who facing a dead end in his career. The unexpected event introduces him to the magic pill which allows him to access 100% of his brain. The next thing he knows, he is able to complete his writing in just one night. In fact, his mind also becomes super smart and an effective analyzer. Now all things are easy, He can fix his fractured relationship with his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish), having a lifetime opportunity to work with successful tycoon investor like Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro). It becomes worse when other people try to take advantage of him and his magic pill. One word for Bradley Cooper, he is awesome! All thiz time, I always thought that Bradley Cooper can be successful as is now just because he is good-looking, thiz time he has proved me wrong. Cooper definitely can describe highs and lows of his complex character. On the other hand, Robert De Niro delivers his typical persona as a charismatic and influential figure. And even though in brief performance, Abbie Cornish can bring out her sex appeal attractively. Neil Burger is the man behind thiz interesting thriller. Burger is formerly known for 'The Illusionist' (2006) and 'The Lucky Ones' (2008).Burger has successfully provided a dynamic storytelling with compelling narrative. The instrumental song that sounds 'Da da da da Da da da' will be one of the memorable characteristics of thiz movie, in addition to 'Infinite Zoom Sequence' that appears in the opening credits. Everything is grand, except one thing, the ending! The storyline is very nicely built since the very beginning but I can obviously see that they run out of ideas to conclude thiz story. The ending could have been better. Anyway, As far as I know, the only way to reach thiz kind of state is by mediation, not medication. If everyone is perfect then no one will learn anything.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",8,1,1,15 May 2012
Pulp Fiction," If You Like Independent Movie, Totally You Must See Thiz Movie!
","Thiz movie is known as the most talked about movie of the decade. The movie receives a lot of good reviews from most critics. You must see it yourself then you will understand why. 'Pulp Fiction' is starred by many famous Actors such as John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis and many more. It's directed by Quentin Tarantino who is known for his eccentric works. The plot is unusual, but very intriguing in a strange way. The script made by Tarantino himself. It's kind of confusing in the beginning, but it becomes better and better as time goes by. It moves forward and backward along the movie with attractive flashback sequences. The thing that made thiz movie so special is simply those elements. You must see it over and over to understand the idea. However, actually the plot is just an ordinary plot, but the editing made it extremely extraordinary for overall. The other factor that make thiz movie unforgettable is the dialogue. The dialogue is mostly long but colorful, rude but exciting. Thiz movie is actually made with limited budget, but it's still loaded with many big stars. Thiz has proved that the Actors know for sure there is something very special in the script. The other memorable scene that you will never forget is when the dancing scene of John Travolta and Uma Truman. The dancing is phenomenal. Most people remember Travolta for his 1980s musical movies such as 'Saturday Night Fever' (1977) and 'Grease' (1978). Today, when we see him dancing again with his present figure, you can feel in that very moment, something magical is happening. That is the fun part. If you like indie movie, you certainly must go to see thiz one.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",10,2,5,17 April 2010
Les Misérables," It Fell Hard As A Musical But Heartfelt As A Movie
","As a huge fan of musical movies, I had been waiting for thiz. It's one of my most anticipated movies of the year. Soon after I walked out of the theater, I realized that thiz movie was very peculiar. Let me put it thiz way, as the musical, I can confidently say that the music is not at its best. If you listen to the song without seeing the movie, it will feel like half-baked. But if you see it as a movie experience as a whole, when you can see the Actors are singing with their expression and emotion, at that time, then you can feel that thiz is a very strong and breathtaking musical movie. In short, it fell hard as a musical but heartfelt as a movie. Tom Hooper is a film Director who is always able to capture his characters with totality without missing a single thing through his unique cinematography, as shown in 'The Damned United' (2009) and 'The King's Speech' (2010). In thiz famous classic tale, there are so many interesting characters to be explored. There is Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) an ex-convict who struggles to redeem his sin, Javert (Russel Crowe) who is a ruthless police inspector, Fantine (Anne Hathaway) a single mother who turned into streetwalker, Thénardier and his wife (Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter) who are sophisticated gang of thieves, Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) who is beautiful daughter of Fantine, Marius (Eddie Redmayne) who is a courageous revolutionary partisan, Éponine (Samantha Barks) who is spoiled daughter of Thénardier and everybody's favorite the brave little boy Gavroche (Daniel Huttlestone). I notice what Tom Hooper has done as the Director in order to build a strong impression for each of his characters. He simply gives everyone at least one chance to deepen their characters by singing in a special close-up segment. Each character, major role or small role, has thiz particular segment. And guess who is taking thiz opportunity well? It's Anne Hathaway who makes a convincing heartrending performance by giving up her pretty long hair and successfully bringing out all the emotions. The other Actor who surprises me is Hugh Jackman. Jackman also takes his role very seriously and it definitely pays off. His character as Jean Valjean has many up and down situations but he has no trouble at all playing it. And for the refreshing part (since the movie is extremely melancholy from the very beginning), the comical couple Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as Monsieur and Madame Thénardier have succeeded to cheer up the atmosphere by delivering some fresh humor. The first half of the movie is about suffering and the second half is more about love. Whatever it is, we are finally coming to the conclusion that suffering and love are the things that keep human learning. Anyway, I love the spirit! It's all about the spirit of a minority, the spirit of change and the resistance against absolute monarchy and oppression. In the end, I have to admit that thiz movie is not for everyone, particularly if you are not a fan of musicals. Nevertheless, thiz movie still conclude with a very good ending indeed. There is a gratifying feeling after watching the ending. In fact, if you are in the right mood, you might end up with a happy tear. Vive la France!

Titanic," Be A Part of Historical Moment by Experiencing Titanic
","A friend asked me, 'Will the movie look exactly the same as 1997s version? '. I spontaneously told him, 'Well, the ship will still be sinking.'. Ha ha But seriously, it's an unforgettable experience and definitely worth seeing! James Cameron invites us to revisit the RMS Titanic and thiz time in 3D. And you know what? I still get goosebumps ever since the first 10 minutes I saw thiz movie. I admit that everyone can make a review on 'Titanic', surely everyone has something to say about thiz movie. It's not just that the ship is gigantic but also literally big as a movie. The Director James Cameron did explore almost everything. The real tragic event with the latest forensic science and one of the most beautiful stories ever told. Thiz is the man who brought you 'Aliens' (1986), 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' (1991) and 'Avatar' (2009). A simple adventurer Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) won a ticket in a lucky hand at poker for the journey of a lifetime, where he meets a desperate aristocrat Rose (Kate Winslet) who suffers anguish after being forced to marry a rich steel tycoon Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). The journey is going to change their lives forever. The other Cast members are Kathy Bates, Bill Paxton, Frances Fisher, Victor Garber and Bernard Hill as Captain Edward James Smith. The cinematography is splendid. What I do remember is the dynamic camera movements, the afternoon sunshine, the wind, the wave, everything! I'm always impressed by how they capture the moment of 'I'm Flying Scene', when Jack teaches Rose how to step over the big ship's prow and spread her arms wide. The chemistry seems so natural and sincere. The love story is compelling in every possible way. It's like 'Romeo and Juliet' kind of thing. 'You Jump, I jump' is also one of my absolute favorite moments. Yes, we do care about Jack and Rose. The elderly Rose who is played by Gloria Stuart also deserves mention for her memorable performance. Stuart successfully brings the story alive with her powerful storytelling. The song from Celine Dion, 'My Heart Will Go On' is not just great, but it's legendary! Once again, it is worth watching in 3D. Although thiz re-release version is the conversion result from 2D standard material to 3D, but it's your best chance to experience the magical wonder which feels like you're actually standing on the deck of Titanic. One day you can proudly tell your kids or even grandchildren that you saw 'Titanic' in the theater. Yes, thiz will be a historic moment! I have to say, I love the ending. It's one of the greatest ending scenes in cinematic history. Spoiler Alert! After the elderly Rose passes away, in afterlife somehow she's young again and meets the love of her life Jack at staircase in the main lobby of the Titanic. Then they're just kissing. It's so sweet and overwhelming. The movie reminds us that nothing is eternal, but still a specific moment can be eternal in our hearts. So are you ready to go back to Titanic?

Burlesque," Welcome to Christina's Playground
","Raise the curtain! Before heading to watch thiz movie, I already had my own imagination about how the story would look like, I thought maybe it revolved around a countryside girl who was about to try her luck to chase her dream in a big city (eventually the city is Los Angeles and the girl's name is Ali which is played by Christina Aguilera), maybe she would start from a cloistered but extraordinary nite club (apparently it named Burlesque), maybe she would have a tough beginning for her career and there would be such a mentor for her (I talk about Cher), maybe she was going to meet her love interest, a pretty boy with an attitude (I talk about Cam Gigandet), or maybe she would be forced to quarrel with her envious evil colleague as well (I talk about Kristen Bell). And for the ending I don't have to explain, I give it to you to figure it out yourself, I am pretty sure that you have already know the ending as well, and you are right! In the tradition of 'Coyote Ugly' (2000) and Rob Marshall's movies such as 'Chicago' (2002) and 'Nine' (2009), here it comes a new breed of the genre. The movie is second directing effort after 'Glass House: The Good Mother' (2006) by former child star of 'The Goonies' (1985), Steve Antin. Thiz Ali's character is obviously made for Aguilera, it's like let a fish swims freely into the sea. It flows naturally. Cher is a legendary music icon who makes one dimensional impression, there is no specific chemistry with other Cast members, she seems to be talking to herself. Cam Gigandet, after seeing his macho performance previously in 'Never Back Down' (2008), thiz time he plays more easy-going and fun role. But the worst of the worst is Kristen Bell who delivers a horrible nightmare performance, it's not convincing at all as Ali's competitor. Better performances come from Stanley Tucci, Eric Dane and Allan Cumming. Forget about the Actors, the film once again is an Aguilera's playground. Her powerful voice covers up all the flaws. The opening song 'Something's Got a Hold on Me' is my favorite with gratifying 1970s Rock 'n' Roll tune. With all those fabulous songs, it comes to my mind why there isn't one single duet song from these two world class performers. Anyway, the dancing and cabaret performances are splendid. Aguilera's performance is very hypnotic and spectacular. In fact, who doesn't want to pay small nite club's cheap ticket that there is a performance from Christina Aguilera. Hello? It is Christina Aguilera on the stage! The story is predictable and the conflict is cliché. It doesn't look like a movie after all. By the way, I didn't come home from a movie. I had just come home from Christina Aguilera's concert. And I am happy! ^_^ Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",7,5,5,1 February 2011
August Rush," One Word = Superb! (Thiz Review contains Spoiler)
","When I first went to watch 'August Rush', I thought I had to check thiz out just because it's one of the musical movies (Recently, I have seen many and I'm kind of enamored of those musical movies). In the end of the movie, I realize thiz movie is so full-hearted. The story is very simple but strong, I always appreciate simple movie that can express a lot. It's a story about a boy who's eager to find his origin and meaning of his presence. Thiz boy is natural born talent in music, just like his father and mother who are talented musicians. It's all about music. It's told beautifully, the plot has some flashback moments. But don't worry you will not be confused by its method of story-telling. It's directed by woman Director, Kirsten Sheridan. The wonder boy Freddie Highmore performs impressively with his innocent charisma. I think Highmore is definitely lucky to always get involved in some memorable movies. Another Actor who performs a significant role in thiz movie is Jonathan Rhys Myers. He is very lovable, his role as a rock star makes him looks cool. About the ending (Spoiler Alert!), the movie ends with the scene when his father and mother has finally met after many years. And not long after that, they find their boy in a concert stage as well, performs as conductor in an orchestra. The boy doesn't even know his parents have been watching him. And the movie just ends that way. I very much understand that is the perfect ending, that scene describes with beautiful and elegant way. It shows the meaning of hope could be better from now on. It's a very strong description. Superb.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",9,2,3,17 April 2010
Dark Shadows," Gothic, Epic, Classic, Mystic, Magic, Comic, Slapstick, Frantic, Scenic, Antique, Not Yet Tragic, But With No Garlic!
","Who else could be the better choice to direct thiz movie other than Tim Burton. The description is Gothic, epic, classic, mystic, magic, comic, slapstick, frantic, scenic, antique, not yet tragic, but with no garlic! Just like his previous masterpieces such as 'Beetle Juice' (1988), 'Edward Scissorhands' (1990), 'Big Fish' (2003) and 'Alice in Wonderland' (2010). Thiz time, Tim Burton tries to bring back classic vampire tale based on the original TV series in 1970s-era. The story takes place in the year 1972, when 196-year-old vampire Barnabas Collins has just awakened in his coffin after being cursed by a cold hearted witch Angelique Bouchard who previously fell for him. Now, he arrives back in his grandiose mansion to restore his family to its former glory, what he doesn't know later, the world has changed a lot since his last departure. The original version looked more like a soap opera, but in Tim Burton's hand it turns out to be a fresh family drama with some mysterious elements and sometimes cynical good humor. It's certainly acceptable, considering Tim Burton has done his homework for compiling 1.225 TV episodes into two-hour movie. On thiz occasion, the Director Tim Burton has also successfully gathered together all his favorite performers. Thiz is his eighth collaboration with Johnny Depp, his seventh with his real-life partner Helena Bonham Carter, his fifth with Christopher Lee and his second with Michelle Pfeiffer after her role as Catwoman in 'Batman Returns' (1992). Have you ever seen the original Barnabas Collins which played by Jonathan Frid? If you are old enough to have a chance to see his performance previously, you probably would have realized that Johnny Depp has done a lot of efforts to portray that character through his tone of voice, his facial expression and even his gestures. Beside that, there are some other performances which have got my attention. For the umpteenth time, Chloë Grace Moretz has shown her maturity in acting, thiz time to become a rebel teen daughter. Bella Heathcote also makes a special impression as a mysterious new nanny. And Eva Green is obviously very attractive and sensual even as a ruthless witch. The rest of the Cast members are Johnny Lee Miller, Jackie Earle Haley and Gulliver McGrath, plus a special guest appearance by the legendary rock star Alice Cooper. In fact, the gang of 1970s version also make cameo appearances as the guests in the ballroom party scene, including the late Jonatahan Frid, Lara Parker, David Selby and Kathryn Leigh Scott. Thiz movie really brings us back in time to 1970s. Everything is so authentic, including the clothes, the hairstyles, the cars and even the songs. My favorite moment is when they play the song 'Top of the World' by The Carpenters. Somehow, the song sounds so fresh and uplifting. It sounds pretty much like thiz, 'Such a feeling's coming over me. There is wonder in most everything I see'. It can also be precise words to describe thiz movie. Get ready for nostalgia ^_^ Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",7,1,2,31 May 2012
Inception," A New Level of Ingenious Movie
","An Idea. A single idea from the human mind can do anything. That's what the Director Christopher Nolan wants to resuscitate us. I'm amazed by Nolan who could always tell such a complicated story smoothly. He already proved his capability on his previous works like 'Batman Begins' (2005), 'The Dark Knight' (2008) and sophisticated magician's tale in 'The Prestige' (2006). But I prefer to compare thiz one with his earlier masterpiece 'Memento' (2000). What he was good at, not just a great storyteller (I think he is the best in our generation) but he always made a brilliant twist and turn in every ending of his stories. 'Inception' consists of multi layer story-telling which is tremendously executed well, precise what we saw on 'Memento'. 'Inception' is simply a bigger scale of 'Memento'. The story tells how Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his team could invade to people's minds through their dream and Cobb's job is to steal it, or plant a new one. In my notes, DiCaprio's performance isn't better than his appearance in 'Shutter Island' at early thiz year, but it is definitely not a bad one either. Once again, he is success with his script selections and delivers some constant performances. Ellen Page and Cillian Murphy also provide amazing performances. Both of them had just shown their extraordinary performances in 'Peacock' (2010). I have to say Murphy brings one of the best performances for overall. But the best appearance belongs to Marion Cottilard as Cobb's vulnerable wife. The other supporting Cast members are terrific, filled with the heavy caliber Actors such as Joseph-Gordon Levitt, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe and Michael Caine. The side story about the dark past of Cobb and his wife draws my attention. The chemistry and that background story are one of the interesting parts from thiz movie. I could easily say, 'The Folding City' and 'Revolving Room' scenes will be one of the memorable moments in cinematic history. Thiz time, Nolan takes us to his dream where an idea becomes seed of possibility. A great opening, a nice built concept for the main plot and deceitful twist of ending, that's all we need for new level of ingenious movie. Simply, experience your life through dream.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",9,1,3,18 July 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Here He Comes. The Funky Sherlock!
","Before thiz newest version, there were about 200 movies that brought Sherlock into the wide screen and more than 70 Actors had ever played thiz famous character. Sherlock Holmes is a well-known detective on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle novels (Which first time is published in 1887). Sherlock on thiz movie is Robert 'Iron Man' Downey Jr., accompanied by his fellow side-kick Dr. John Watson (Jude Law). The other Cast members are Rachel McAdams and Mark Strong. At a glance, Downey Jr. doesn't seem to care how to perform Sherlock authentically. Otherwise, he just acts naturally with his own style and just has fun with his version of Sherlock. As we know, Sherlock is a calm, discreet and charismatic person. But in the end, I think viewers will also agree to put aside the original Sherlock for a while, because thiz version is surprisingly enjoyable. In overall, the movie is entertaining enough and hilarious at the same time. The Director is Guy Ritchie. Ritchie is previously known as indie Director, his best works are 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' (1998) and 'Snatch' (2000). The storyline of thiz movie is kind of exciting at the beginning, a little lame in the middle, and it's closed by an appropriate twist of ending. After watching thiz movie, it comes to my mind, Downey Jr's version of Sherlock resembles with Will Smith's 'Wild Wild West' (1999). But we have to admit that thiz movie is way more mature. Here he comes, the funky Sherlock! Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",7,0,2,17 April 2010
The Dark Knight Rises," It's Not Bat At All!
","One of the smartest Directors of our generation is about to conclude his famous saga. Oh yes, you should anticipate what's he going to do next. Christopher Nolan has built a superb franchise through two successful prequels 'Batman Begins' (2005) and 'The Dark Knight' (2008). No wonder everyone is hyped about it and the excitement is rising high. The Batman character has changed a lot over the years. The two most important influences are Frank Miller's graphic novel 'Batman: Year One' (1987) and Tim Burton's movie 'Batman' (1989), not just changing the image entirely but also affecting today's superhero movies. What I'm trying to say is you will soon witness a historic event as well. We are going to see the next phase of Batman's transition. In thiz grand finale to an epic trilogy, Christopher Nolan definitely takes Batman to the whole new level. Christian Bale also deserves a credit for making Bruce Wayne character even more dynamic and attractive. Bale is certainly not just an ordinary Actor, he can play any character he wants, not just good, but great. I don't know why Nolan takes so many risks by changing the winning formula. Spoiler Alert! There are more day scenes than night scenes, Bruce Wayne becomes poor, firing Alfred and other radical changes. As a matter of fact, it's not Bat at all! I don't feel like I have been watching Batman movie, it's more like a typical Nolan's movie that happens to be Batman in it. There is no doubt that the Joker was portrayed amazingly by the late Heath Ledger in 'The Dark Knight' (2008). Christopher Nolan himself knows very well that he should find something new, something phenomenal enough to replace it. Well, at least he has done half of his homework. Although the merciless masked villain Bane (Tom Hardy) is very terrifying, especially through his monstrous voice and intimidating appearance, but it is lack of character. Catwoman doesn't leave any impression. Yes, she is still sexy but only physically. I can hardly remember anything besides Catwoman becomes Anne Hathaway, instead of the other way around. Better performances come from two Cast members of 'Inception' (2010), Marion Cotillard and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. It makes five of them, the others are Tom Hardy, Michael Caine and Cillian Murphy. The other regular Cast members are Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon and Morgan Freeman as Luscious Fox. In fact, in the middle of the story, the movie loses its track, too many unnecessary scenes, sometimes too wordy and almost flat out boring. Even worse, it's compounded by one-dimensional fight choreography. Every time Batman and Bane fight, it looks like B-Class movie. But I still think 'The Bike Chase Scene' is spectacular. In the end, hey it's Christopher Nolan! Of course, he saves something for the ending. Finally, I can say the epic concludes with a very classy way, typical Nolan's twists and turns. It's another ambiguous ending from him. Don't you ever discuss it or you will find yourself in the middle of never-ending debate about what really happened at the end of 'The Dark Knight Rises'. No more spoilers, find your own hints. Have a nice Bat!Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",7,7,14,30 July 2012
Toy Story 3," Thiz Toy Is A Winner
","I always believe that 'Toy Story' in 1995 was the first brick of Pixar's grandiose castle. 15 years go by, Pixar becomes more stronger and creative, not just in technology innovation but also for the story. Now, for carrying their important icon in 'Toy Story 3', of course they will bring out the best of them. Two earlier prequels include 'Toy Story 2' in 1999 was directed by John Lasseter. But for thiz reunion, the Director is replaced by Lee Unkrich, the former Co-Director from 'Monster, Inc.' (2001) and my favorite Pixar of all-time 'Finding Nemo' (2003). It tells 17-year-old Andy will go to the college soon, now all his beloved toys are in jeopardy. They face a dilemma which is the toys will be given away to charity or being dump in attic. The familiar characters almost share in equal proportion, whether the cowboys Woody (Tom Hanks) and Jessie (Joan Cusack), the space ranger Buzz (Tim Allen), the fussy Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, the dumb dinosaur Rex, the follower Slinky Dog, the pinky piggy Hamm and three little green Aliens, plus introducing new foe, strawberry-scented huggin' bear called Lotso with his vicious gang. In overall, thiz movie is filled with well-arranged story and fun dialogue. From the opening scene, the adventure already rolls with explosive action scenes. The story-telling is very fast, there is almost no breathing room. I almost think that thiz movie is just similar to the prequels before. But something more happens, the ending shocks me. The power of thiz movie is definitely on its 15 minutes of ending (Spoiler Alert!), when Andy passes all his toys to neighbor's kid, Bonnie. He introduces one by one his toys and plays with her. That heartwarming scene is so touching. The ending has made thiz toys a winner. Once again, Pixar takes us to a new height with its winning theme, to infinity and beyond!

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Be Proud To Be Harry Potter's Generation!
","We have finally come to the last page of J.K. Rowling's epic saga. Thiz is the final adventure of wonder boy wizard Harry Potter. The seventh and last book split into two separate movies. To be honest, it's very hard to criticize since the movies were shot back-to-back. In other words, these movies are actually one movie. The opening sequence has a very slow pace of storytelling which allows every detail can be described better. There is no need for further explanation. The story starts right away, showing the preparation of dark lord to hunt Harry Potter and the dark atmosphere surrounding Hogwarts which is now ruled by Professor Snape (Alan Rickman). Meanwhile, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) continue on their journey to find the last Horcruxes. The story eventually has some twists to throw at the end of the movie, but for most of the fans it will not be a twist anymore since they had already read the series books before thiz movie. The final battle between Harry Potter and the dark lord himself is one of the most highly anticipated scenes. The long awaited climax event is perfectly told, it looks like Daniel Radcliffe has done his best, but I think what makes that final scene so intense is also a splendid acting improvisation by Ralph Fiennes as You-Know-Who. Thiz movie is still directed by David Yates who has been the Director of thiz epic since 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' (2007), 'Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince' (2009) and, of course, 'Harry Potter and the Deathly hallows: Part 1' (2010). Once again, thiz franchise has already become a part of each and every one of us. You will easily agree thiz statement (Spoiler Alert!), especially when we come to the end of the movie which tells Harry Potter, his wife Ginny (Bonnie Wright), Ron and Hermione send their children off to Hogwarts school from platform 3 ¾. In that very moment, we realize what we've just seen is not just Harry Potter, but it is all of us who have become older and mature during thiz franchise. Be proud to be Harry Potter's generation!

The Matrix," Smart Movie With Crazy Action!
","'The Matrix' is the best action movie has ever made on my list. When 'The Matrix' was released on its time, thiz movie contributes many breakthrough methods for cinema world. The movie is directed by Larry and Andy Wachowski who was under radar all these times. They are only known as small budget film Directors in 'Bound' (1996). Later, 'The Matrix' has two more back-to-back sequels which are 'Matrix Reloaded' and 'Matrix Revolution' in 2003. You can almost classify the stars in thiz movie as B-Class Actors, if it's not because of Keanu Reeves, but still the outcome is beyond the expectations. Each of the characters like Neo (Keanu Reeves), Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) , even the villain Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) have already become a legendary icon in the industry. One of the strengths of thiz movie is the phenomenal action scenes. The fight scenes are something new and different, which is later followed by other movies. Behind that extraordinary fight scenes are experienced Martial Arts Choreographer Yuen Woo Ping. Woo Ping is the man behind 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' (2000), 'Kill Bill' (2003),'The Forbidden Kingdom' (2008) and even Jackie Chan's Kung Fu classic like 'Snake in the Eagle's Shadow' (1978). His experiences in a lot of Asian movies made him effective. The movie definitely exceeds our imagination. As a matter of fact, many people do not understand entirely the story of 'The Matrix', there are still many blank spots to be answered. Eventually, the movie is filled with countless great philosophies inside. It seems like Wachowski Brothers have discovered how to make a brilliant concept for the story by fetching the philosophies from some religions. The essence is not that simple as it looks, actually we will always have something new every time we watch it over and over again. 'The Matrix' is a smart movie and will always be one of my favorite movies of all-time! Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",9,0,1,17 April 2010
Cloud Atlas," Universality of Mankind
","What you might feel after watching thiz movie? You may be confused, you may be disappointed or if you watch closely enough, you may find a hidden philosophy inside. Thiz movie has six stories with six different time periods, from little island in South Pacific to the post-apocalyptic Hawaiian Islands, from the primitive year 1849 to far in the future 2321. The stories come from any direction and finally meet at one point. The story is meant to be connected to one another, however, don't be surprised if you eventually find that the connection is very minor. In point of fact, you may miss the connection if you're not careful. 'Cloud Atlas' is the latest project from Tom Tykwer and The Wachowskis, starring Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Jim Broadbent, Ben Winshaw, James D'Arcy, Susan Sarandon, Hugh Grant, Doona Bae and Xun Zhou. All Actors have more than one role during different time periods. As a matter of fact, some Actors are so buried underneath their makeup that we could hardly recognize them. To make things even worse, some of them are seemingly drawn into comical performances such as Hugo Weaving, James D'Arcy, Susan Sarandon and Hugh Grant. The better performances come from Tom Hanks, Halle Berry and Ben Winshaw. And the scene stealer is definitely Doona Bae who depicts a genetically-engineered clone named Sonmi-451. Doona Bae delivers a complex and inspiring character. On the directorial side, Tom Tykwer carries out 1936's, 1973's and 2012's segment. On the other side, Andi and Lana (used to be Larry) Wachowski handle 1849's, 2144's and 2321's segment. Personally, I prefer Wachowskis' direction. They can keep up the pace of their stories and prevent it from being boring. It reminds us of how good The Wachowskis really are when depicting futuristic tales, just like what they did in 'The Matrix' (1999). On the other hand, even though I love the previous Tom Tykwer's works such as 'Run Lola Run' (1998), but thiz time, he seems to have put anything one-dimensional. In other words, Tom Tykwer's direction is boring. If it's not because of the intriguing futuristic tale of Sonmi-451 which is directed by The Wachowskis, thiz movie will undoubtedly become an unnecessary B-Class movie. In the end, thiz is something bigger than you think. It's all about a belief in the universality of mankind. Basically, there is no difference between countries, races and even genders, where white can become black, black can become white and white can become Asian. We are all one, we are all the same, learning and strive for a better condition.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",7,1,2,6 February 2013
300," Cinematic Break-through after 'The Matrix'
","The storyline is simple, but the visual is a revolutionary breakthrough. It's very rare to find a movie that could deliver such a new acceptable method. Last time, we were amazed by 'Matrix' (1999). Apparently, it seems that thiz style of movie-making will be followed by other movies in the future. '300' is based on noir comic which is written by Frank Miller. Miller's creations are always filled by dark aspect, blood and beautiful battle. Miller is also known as the mastermind of 'Sin City' (2005) and Batman's 'The Dark Knight' (2008). The movie is directed by Zack Snyder. Snyder is success to combine his imagination with the latest Special Effects. The result is amazing. The movie looks like one painted portrayal by professional painter. The lighting and shadowing are mesmerizing. The movie is starred by mediocre performers such as Gerard Butler, Lena Headey, Dominic West, David Wenham and Michael Fassbender. I think the plot is based on recent issue. It's about Rome Spartans defends from Persian's aggression. Indirectly, it reflects on 9/11 incident but it is told in reverse. Anyway, thiz could be just a coincidence. The ending (Spoiler Alert!), King Leonidas and his 300 warriors died in the battle. But I very much understand the essence. The essence is about the struggling which is more divine than the victory itself. The movie like thiz always has a similar end, for example 'Braveheart' (1995), 'The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc' (1999), 'Gladiator' (2000) and other similar movies. The hero has always died in the battle. Principally, those movies emphasize what we remember most from a hero will be his struggling.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",8,4,6,17 April 2010
Fast Five," Gas Pedal to Full Throttle
","Race cars speeding along the street of Rio De Jainero, All Cast members come together all at once, the rooftop chasing and ultimate gun shooting, what more can you ask? Here it comes the fifth installment of 'The Fast and the Furious' (2001) franchise, thiz is actually the bridging story between 'The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift' (2006) and is a direct connection to the ending scenes of 'Fast & Furious' (2009), when Dom (Vin Diesel) was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison and Brian's gang (Paul Walker) attempt to free him again. Justin Lin directs thiz sequel with identical pace and tone from previous movies. Just like the previous F & F movies, it's all about high speed car racing, hot sexy babes and some of cat and mouse criminal activities. Well, to tell you the truth, thiz time is more like a heist movie than car race movie. We will find very less of eye-catching race cars, the movie puts aside many glamour factors, to do otherwise they step on the gas pedal to full throttle into pure action. Frankly, I don't know for sure, who are the real 'Fast Five' in thiz movie. Certainly, the focus is still on two central characters Dom and Brian. The rest are Dom's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster), the big mouth Roman (Tyrese Gibson), the high tech mechanic Tej (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges), the big muscle Vince (Matt Schulze), the beautiful driver Gal (Gisele Harabo) and the charismatic Sung Kang (Han Lue) from 'The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift'. One thing for sure, there are more than five people. Thiz time they will face a well-matched opponent, the ambitious Federal Agent Luke Hobbs who is presented by Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson! Thiz seems to be a great selection. The Rock delivers a strong and believable tough guy performance, I'm beginning to think thiz WWE's sensation could be a great serious Actor as well. On the other hand, Vin Diesel performs one round of WWE's wrestling scene with The Rock. It's pretty entertaining to see two giant muscles brutally clash with each other in bare hand fight. Thiz time it comes to my mind, if Vin Diesel would also be one hell of great wrestler in WWE's ring? With all the hype and enthusiasm around, thiz is clearly not the last F & F movie to be made, they will be back to do their things again. Thiz implicit confirmation is exposed in one of Hobb's famous lines, 'We'll find 'em, we take 'em as a team and we bring 'em back. And above all else, we don't ever, ever let them get into cars (again)'.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",7,2,4,15 June 2011
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Shirtless Werewolf + Very-cool Vampire + Girl Who Can't Even Made Up Her Mind = 'Twilight' Us
","Thiz movie is phenomenal. A lot of movie critics sneer at thiz romantic flick. But on thiz review, I want to stay neutral and try to be objective. If you want to be fair, whoever the Director or the Cast members will be getting a hard time to fulfil viewer great expectation since everyone pays full attention to thiz franchise. The original content is written by a woman novelist Stephenie Meyer. Twilight Saga schedules for quadrilogy. I think thiz third constellation is better than the second one, 'New Moon' (2009). But the first one 'Twilight' (2008) is still the best because of its mysterious atmosphere and effective introduction by former Director Catherine Hardwicke. Thiz time, The Director is David Slade who is previously known for '30 Days of Night' in 2007. Thiz sequel has better pace of story-telling. Although some people said the sequences are a little bit slow and boring. But I think if you want to get some precise romantic scenes, thiz is the only way to do it. Slade successfully captures the emotions for most of the times with his close up cinematography. If we look at the main performers, Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and Isabella Swan (Kristen Stewart) do not show much improvement than before. The better performance belongs to Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) with his deep eye gaze. The best performance surprisingly comes from the supporting Cast member Dakota Fanning as Jane, one of the Volturi members. With her accent tone and body language, Fanning made an incredible vampire's aura. The blood-thirsty Jasper's character (Jackson Rathbone) annoys me a little bit. His character evolves too much. In two earlier prequels he was almost invisible, but on thiz third one he has changed dramatically to become tough vampire warrior. I observe, Thiz is an odd movie, where girls love it and boys hate it. I hope they didn't come to the theater just to see some good looking faces (I'm saying thiz, it's not because I'm a Twilighater). On the other hand, if you look inside, no matter how corny the movie is, it still has a story to tell (I'm saying thiz, it's not because my close friend is Twilighter). The formula is repeated quite well, shirtless werewolf plus very cool vampire plus girl who can't even made up her mind, equal to movie that totally twilight us.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",5,0,3,8 July 2010
Slumdog Millionaire," The Question About Life is Answered!
","Danny Boyle is one of my favorite Directors of all-time. His films always reflect adventure and humanity. In his latest feature 'Slumdog Millionaire', Boyle accomplishes the best work of his career. The movie tells about a story of a boy who cruising the rough life in India. As we know, the poverty has been one of the essential problems in the third-world like India. Thiz picture has won 8 Oscars, including prime categories in Best Picture, Director, and Adapted Screenplay. Its Begins at present time, Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) has been taken into police custody, after he was accused of cheating in the game show 'Who Wants to be A Millionaire'. His knowledge to answer all the questions makes them curious. The adventure begins when Jamal tells the story of his life where all the events in his previous experiences lead him to the quiz answers. It starts from Jamal's childhood that tells how her mother died tragically in a riot. After that, young Jamal had to learn how to live in the street. He was accompanied by his brother Salim (Madhur Mittal) and a girl named Latika (Freida Pinto). Later we know that his motive to participate in thiz game show is to find Latika. The story adorn with friendship, betrayal and love. The plots in overall is not naive at all, it also reminds us that life is not always fair. The fact behind the movie-making is so ironic. Some of the Cast members still have to live in the slum, somewhere in Bombay. But they are having the full time education now. I heard that the movie makers wanted to keep the money in trusted fund, so when they turn the age of 16 or 17 they will get their full salary which is about 100.000 dollars each. I really comprehend the idea that the only way to win 'Who Wants to be A Millionaire' is just like the story in thiz movie. Maybe I couldn't have all the knowledges in the world, but if you ask me about something that I have experienced before in my life...Yes, I can answer!

Transformers: Dark of the Moon," One Step Back for the Actors and One Giant Leap for the Robots
","If most of the girls go crazy about 'The Twilight Saga' (2008-2012), I think it's totally OK if the boys have their own toys as well! All the boys need is insanely super cool robots and sexy girls. Thiz one is the third movie following 'Transformers' (2007) and 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' (2009). The story still revolves around Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and his new super sexy girlfriend Carly Spencer (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley). Thiz time, they have to uncover the mysterious origins of Autobots and Decepticons which later take them to a hidden fact when Apollo 11 landed on dark side of the moon 42 years ago. The movie featuring a real hero, the second person ever to walk on the moon, Edwin 'Buzz' Aldrin. The Director is still Michael Bay. I aware that Michael Bay always has a young spirit in all of his movies, even in his war movie like 'Pearl Harbor' (2001). But I also have to say most of his movies are always filled with exaggerated brainless actions and comically overacted characters like in 'Bad Boys' (1995), 'The Rock' (1996) and 'Armageddon' (1998). If it's not because of Steven Spielberg's involvement as Executive Producer that contributes lots of technical elements, I think that thiz movie would have been easily forgotten. Yes, the detail of Special Effects is incredible. It's very clear that the main attraction is on its robots. The Autobots consists of Bumblebee, Ironhide, Ratchet, Sideswipe, Dino, Brains, Wheelie and the leader Optimus Prime. They are back in action to fight for freedom. And the villainous side named Decepticon consists of Starscream, Shockwave, Soundwave, Laserbeak and the leader Megatron. All of them still dream of tyranny. The robots are voiced by some well-known Actors such as Hugo Weaving as Megatron and Star Trek's Mr. Spock, Leonard Nimoy as Sentinel Prime. Thiz is one of the very rare cases which the robots have better performances than the human Actors. All actors are drawn to be unnecessary comical characters without exception, including John Malkovich, Patrick Dempsey, John Turturro, Frances McDormand, Ken Jeong and Tyrese Gibson. The model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has the same color of lipstick and hair, it doesn't mean that she can instantly replace Megan Fox's character. As you can see, she is there only to provide the visual pleasure, not acting. Julie White repeats her overacted performance as Sam's mother, thiz is one of the ugliest actings you will ever see. Sam's character is not lovable at all. I don't know what Shia LaBeouf thinks when he delivers such a character. Sam is just a jerk with amazingly gorgeous girlfriend beside him. He looks so cocky and egoistic by always yelling and swearing during the entire film. It comes to my mind, maybe they need to get rid all of the human characters in next films, and let the robots deal with their own conflicts, just like what we had in original animated TV series 'The Transformers' in 1984 to 1987. Thiz movie has shown that's one step back for the Actors and one giant leap for the robots.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",5,2,6,30 April 2012
The Social Network," Controversy Makes Things Attractive
","'I just wished that nobody made a movie of me while I was alive', Mark Zuckerberg has ever said so. But it is unbearable, they made it anyway. The next question will be who on earth is Mark Zuckerberg? The movie is based on the 2009s book by Ben Mezrich entitled 'The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook, A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal'. Yup, the movie is about people behind the birth of Facebook, the most massive social network in our generation. In the first half of the movie depicts how Zuckerberg fills his activities with blogging and programming. And finally ends up with launching The Facebook from his Harvard dormitory room. Someone told me, thiz movie is all about suing. Well, I think she was right. Substantively, the second half of the movie emphasizes who is the real creator of The Facebook through some legal processes. Anyone can sue anyone. The question is whether or not he would win. There are three important characters in thiz movie. First is Jesse Eisenberg who played as Zuckerberg, fully equipped with his slipper. Personally, I think Eisenberg sometimes talks too fast and delivers a stiff mien. His performance is just enough. The second is the pop star Justin Timberlake who brings a precise deep and dominant charisma into his character as Napster's founder, Sean Parker. The last but not the least, actually it is the best performance for overall, comes from our next Spider-Man (2012), Andrew Garfield. Garfield gives a complete emotional package for his character, a friend and new enemy as well, Edurado Saverin. Subjectively, the book 'Accidental Billionaires' was advised by Eduardo Saverin himself, without any involvement from Zuckerberg's side. So the point of view is fittingly one-sided. The ending of the movie itself is stagnant and flat which I'm kind of surprised. Thiz movie comes from one of my favorite Directors, David Fincher. Almost half of Fincher's masterpieces have a smart and twist ending, just like what we have found in 'Se7en' (1995), 'The Game' (1997) and one of my favorite movies of all-time 'Fight Club' (1999). But on second thought, I think it's already maximized anyway, considering thiz is a biography. In the end, if you ask me why Zuckerberg and his Facebook? Why not Bill Gates or anyone else? I think I can see something here. One vital element that they do not have and Zuckerberg has it. It is controversy. Controversy makes things more attractive. In these days of technology era, whoever has the ability to conquer the internet, it's simply being God himself.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",8,1,2,8 November 2010
The Fighter," Bale's Knock Out Performance
","I saw Christian Bale for the first time when he was in Steven Spielberg's war epic 'Empire of the Sun' (1987). He was an innocent child with red ruddy face. And now, he is on a transition to become a great character Actor, always bumps into great movies with great scripts (I observe that the other one has to be Leo DiCaprio). Have you ever heard about Micky Ward? He was former WBU World Champion in 1980s period. Thiz is a real-life story about early years of his career. Talking about Ward will not be completed without talking about the man behind him, his personal trainer and half blood brother, former Welterweight Champion Dicky Eklund. Eklund's most notable fight was when he against Sugar Ray Leonard in 1978. I find that boxing movies always made a deep impression about human struggle. It is perfect metaphor for any of us. You could feel the deepness and intensity like in Robert DeNiro's 'Raging Bull' (1980), Denzel Washington's 'The Hurricane' (1999), Russel Crowe's 'Cinderella Man' (2005) and even American hero icon 'Rocky' (1976-2006). Micky Ward is played by Mark Wahlberg. At a glance, Wahlberg is a perfect choice for boxer figure, but once again Mark Wahlberg is still Mark Wahlberg, although his acting is not bad at all, we can still see the typical Mark Walhberg. In fact, the most interesting part that attracts us in thiz film is definitely Christian Bale's transformation as Dicky Eklund. If you know Eklund in person, then you know how Eklund's attitude looks like, how he talks, the body language and his indifferent demeanor. Bale made a phenomenal impression to portray that figure completely. A good acting is not only coming from the appearance, but how you can create a precise 'Soul' to fill into the character. And Bale made it! After all these years, he reminds me of how much he has been dealing with each of his roles so seriously. For me, he is the next Daniel Day-Lewis. The next thing that catches my attention is Amy Adams. Have you ever seen her acting in 'Enchanted' (2007)? Adams made a sturdy and sexy performance all at once as Ward's girlfriend. I keep asking myself, where has that princess Giselle's character gone? The best bold performance actually comes from Melissa Leo for the mother figure. There is a scene in a living room, when Leo talks furiously to her family. In that moment, I really feel she actually talks to me. The amazing gesture to portray a real situation surprisingly comes from that small role. Again, the movie uses a lot of hand-shake camera techniques to drag you into the middle of the situation. Notably, I love how every time they pull us into 'Boxing Ring Scene'. Suddenly, it looks like we have been watching those 1980s TV boxing matches, the picture contrast and camera angles have suddenly changed dramatically. The movie direction comes from not too very active Director, David O. Russel. He usually only made one film for every two or three years. Some of his previous directing credits are 'I Heart Huckabees' (2004) and my favorite 'Three Kings' (1999). Substantively, you could see that Eklund uses Ward to redeem his past mistakes. Eklund needs Ward. Even more, His entire family needs Ward. I really understand, Ward becomes their asset, hope and dream. But the truth is Ward also needs them. The movie reminds us of everybody needs everybody. You don't need time-machine to change your past. But you can actually change it now in a present time.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",7,1,1,23 January 2011
Up in the Air," Spontaneous Movie Reflects Reality
","It's a simple and spontaneous movie, but it turns out to be deep and inspirational one. The movie is directed by Jason Reitman, the young Director and the son of Ivan Reitman. Ivan Reitman is well-known as a Producer and acclaimed Director through his fun and pop corn movies such as 'Ghostbusters' (1984), 'Kindergarten Cop' (1990) and 'Evolution' (2001). Flip over with his father, Jason Reitman is well-known in these recent years as a Director in thoughtful and enjoyable dramas like 'Thank You for Smoking' (2005) and 'Juno' (2007). The trio Cast members fill the characters properly. George Clooney once again shows his talent for one-man-show, Clooney is one of the Actors who could deliver such character with his aura. Vera Farmiga appears a little bit sexy, charming and lovable. It's a fantastic flirtatious appearance. Anna Kendricks emerges annoying but gets sympathy in the end. The unique story is about Ryan Bingham (Clooney), a frequent flyer who across many states. His job is to fire people by representing his boss who doesn't bold enough to do it himself. Maybe for many people, thiz is a life drama movie. But personally for me, thiz is a great romantic movie with most of the scenes contain tremendous chemistry between Clooney and Farmiga. It has been a long time, I didn't have such a feeling since 'Lost in Translation' (2003). In the end, the movie convinces us that we need a partner in life. But it's ironically played by 'Life-time Bachelor' George Clooney in the real life, at least until now. Yup, maybe that's true, 'Everybody needs a co-pilot'.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",8,0,2,16 April 2010
