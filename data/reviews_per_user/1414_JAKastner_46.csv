Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The Moose Hole - Review of Kill Bill (Volume II)
","`Revenge is a dish best served cold.'When we last left off, Quentin Tarantino has re-emerged onto the Hollywood scene for the first time in six years with not just one but two films to be released into theaters to an overwhelmingly awaiting cult audience. But not everyone was especially happy with the decision of both Tarantino and his distributor, Miramax Pictures, to split the tale of The Bride in two. There were some in the vast assortment of captious movie-goers that took this as a sign of continued greed amongst the `Hollywood elite' in that the decision of splitting the film into two parts was done to get the loyal fans to shell-out double the normal ticket price for essentially one film. Granted, in the end, that turned out not to be the case, as the film would actually be five hours in length and thus be deemed too long to be taken all at once, but the issue still remained whether the rest of Hollywood would follow in the foot-steps of Kill Bill and spark a brand new trend, only this time with less honorable then Tarantino did. That is still to be seen and perhaps that argument is a bit overzealous . In this situation, one shouldn't question what could happen in the future but whether or not the primary influence, namely Kill Bill, did what it claimed it would accomplish, by delivering movie-goers ultimate satisfaction for dollar.Kill Bill (Volume II) is the second, and possibly final, installment of the story that centers on a former member of a group of assassins who seeks revenge for the actions done on to her by her former colleagues. For those unfamiliar with the first installment, here is a slight recap of previous events:A woman known only as The Bride has waken up from a four year comma after her former boss Bill left her for dead on the day of her wedding killing her fiancé, the wedding party and her unborn child. Unfortunately for the skilled assassin, he made one big mistake: he failed to kill her. Now that she has awakened from her living slumber, The Bride will travel the world picking off her attempted killers one by one including the mysterious Bill. First up on her list is O-Ren Ishi, aka Cottonmouth, and her group of Japanese underground assassins and then Vernita Green, aka Copperhead. Upon completing the task of killing her first two targets, The Bride continues on her rampage determined to kill everyone on her list, all the way to Bill.The second installment picks up basically where the first one left off, leaving The Bride heading to her next target, Budd (aka Sidewinder), who happens to be the run-down and vastly inferior brother of Bill himself. But, for at least a few moments, Budd gets the upper-hand on the film's lead assassin by placing her in a coffin and burring her alive. In the time it takes her to escape, the audience is informed on the vast training The Bride took in order to become the superior apache she is today. Upon escaping the make-shift grave, The Bride duels with her contemporary rival, Elle Driver (aka California Mountain Snake), who not only killed Pai Mai but has her eyes set on The Bride herself. The final lag of her journey brings her to the home of Bill himself and along with him comes a little surprise: her daughter. The story for Kill Bill (Volume II) is quite arguably vastly superior to the one written up for the first installment in that this one deals not so much with action but dialogue and meanings discovered behind actions made by characters throughout this film as well as the previous installment. Once again Tarantino demonstrates his remarkable filmmaking skills by back-tracking the story at precise moments that by doing so will explain actions yet to come. Few writers can pull such an effect successful and Tarantino does so brilliantly.As was said with the previous installment, a relative bunch of low-profile actors and actresses make up one of the better casts of the year for this film, but this time around we introduced to a slightly different lot from the last film. Michael Madsen gives a dead-on (no pun intended) performance as Budd, a run-down and subjacent version of his former self now that he is no longer in the hit-man business. Madsen gives a sense that the character really contemplates on what he has done and whether or not he feels remorse for those actions but at the same time showcases the scoundrel that still lives within him. Daryl Hannah is quite intriguing as Elle Driver, clearly the most ruthless and baneful character in the film series. The only problem with her role was the dreadfully over-the-top performance given when her character's eye was plucked out. Granted having one's eye plucked out isn't a pleasant manner but what Hannah presented on screen was unconvincing and quite annoying after some time. Uma Thurman's role in the second installment can't be complimented more then her role in the first . She gives an absolutely brilliant, witty, and exhilarating performance that works every moment she is on screen. And David Carradine, best known for his Kung Fu television series, gives a `sweet', vibrant, and utterly perfect performance as the title character, Bill. He shines in every scenes he is presented in and works exceedingly well with Uma Thurman . There isn't much to say other then `Bravo'!Overall, Kill Bill plays out much like the concept of revenge itself - actions and instincts engulf us at first, but as time goes on and the journey rampages toward its ultimate conclusion, truth and meaning quickly take over. Where Tarantino starts off with a bang, he rightfully finishes off with a shock to our system - maturity and philosophical contemplation on the subject of revenge and what it means for those involved. Those who were truly engulfed by the blood and gut spilling actions of the first film will be greatly disappointed by the second installment unless you are one of those geeks who enjoy dialogue far more then comical violence, which may not be too many. But if there is even just a few then that will demonstrate the true essence of maturity amongst the movie-going public. Despite a pacing that made the feature feel a tad longer then was probably necessary, Kill Bill (Volume II) serves as a fitting conclusion to Quentin Tarantino's near perfect masterpiece . a masterpiece that may take quite some time to surpass but if the young filmmaker keeps putting out work like his previous films, his cult audience is more then willing to wait.",9,46,89,27 April 2004
Miracle," The Moose Hole - Review of Miracle
","There comes a time when a nation faces a crossroad in its history, a time where it must choose where the country goes next. That choice, whatever it may be, will shake the nation down to its core and change that nation's populous forever. In the United States, that situation was no more prominent then in 1980. It was the final year of the Carter administration and on the domestic front, the United States faced soaring inflation, sharp increases in energy prices and high interest rates. The nation fared no better overseas as American diplomats were taken hostage in Iran and the United States butted heads with the Soviet Union over their invasion of Afghanistan. All this turmoil in the presidency of what was the `smartest' president the country had ever had, who in one speech seem to blame all his problems on the American people. No wonder Americans were desperately looking for something to believe in. That revitalization of the American Spirit came in the form of the U.S. Olympic Hockey, who came from behind to pull off one of the greatest moments in sports history.The story focuses on a rag-tag team of hockey players who get past their differences and rise to beat the greatest team in the world at the time, the Soviet Union. Herb Brooks has a real score to settle. In 1960, he was all set to be part of the U.S. Olympic hockey team and bring home a gold medal victory for the country. The end result was Brooks ended up being the last player to be cut from the team and he never had another shot at that medal as a hockey player. As for the United States, they went on to win the gold medal but it would be the last one for nearly twenty years as the U.S.S.R. (or the Soviet Union) would dominate the ice from there on out. That is until Herb Brooks becomes the coach of the U.S. Olympic team and changes the way they play hockey. Instead of going the normal route of choosing NHL All-Stars, Brooks makes a wide variety of choices that he plans to create the perfect team to beat the Russians at their own game. In the world outside the ice rink, political conflicts collide with the Winter Olympics to create a game (between the U.S. and Soviet Union) that would act as a symbolic clashing of strengths. That moment that Americans were looking for something to believe in was now. The story for Miracle, which was based on the true story of the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey team, was surprisingly quite inspirational. Why surprisingly? When an audience goes into a 'based on a true story' film, they practically know what is going to happen, so there is usually a great lack of enthusiasm in the material but Miracle combines the right amount of sports action and patriotism to make a rare nail-biting experience.If anything, it can be said Miracle lacks star-power in its cast but that doesn't seem to hurt it one bit as the 'no-name' stars carry the film with ease. Kurt Russell, who is best known in the Disney world for his roles in such classics as The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes and Follow Me Boys!, takes center stage in the role of Herb Brooks. Russell has the role down to a T including that wonderful Minnesota accent that never feels awkward or half-assed. What makes his performance all the more special is the fact that the real Herb Brooks died shortly after principal photography of this feature was completed, so knowing that Russell put so much enthusiasm and emotion into the role before the death of Brooks shows the real dedication of the actor in his films. Patricia Clarkson, who was just nominated for an Academy Award for her supporting role in Pieces of April, gives a decent performance based on the material given to her in the role of Mrs. Brooks. Granted the filmmakers try to show the complications between Brooks' dream and his family life but her role seems too much of a distraction based on plot. The U.S. Olympic Hockey team on a whole is exceptionally played by a variety of actors, each of which contributes a piece of his talent to create a unified representation on screen.Overall, any film, based on a true story, which can produce a movie-going audience cheering in applause as an end result is worthy of praise. `Do you believe in miracles? Yes!' This shouldn't come as too much of a surprise at Disney seems to have a knack for these sports films with such successes as Remember the Titans and The Rookie. They've covered football, baseball, and hockey. Can basketball be too far behind? Despite a wonderful showing, there are some things to pick at. One is the use of slow motion in the film. Granted this is a sports film and this technique is expected to be used, but in certain moments in the film, it just felt a tad awkward and wasn't necessarily needed. Another is just political commentary on the use of President Jimmy Carter's `malaise' speech in the film. In the context of the film, the filmmakers try to make it out to be an inspirational message, foreshadowing later events in the feature, when in reality it was Carter's blaming of the problems of the nation on the American people. Could it be inspirational in another sense? Yes, but not in the way the filmmakers were attempting to make it out to be. Miracle expresses how even in a time when a nation faces an almost uncertain future, the American people can still be proud of who they are and where they are from, in just one simple moment.My Rating: **** out of 5 (Grade: B+)",8,0,0,1 February 2004
50 First Dates," The Moose Hole - Review of 50 First Dates
","Ah, love! Isn't it grand? Many men find special things to do for the one they love like buy them flowers, candy, or jewelry, while others take them out for a night on the town complete with dinner and . an Adam Sandler comedy? Yeah, it's true, Adam Sandler is releasing his new comedy out on Valentine's Day in an effort to save all adolescent males from being dragged to another Kate Hudson/Julia Roberts/Reese Witherspoon lackluster romantic comedy . Okay, he's not doing it for those exact reasons but you get the idea.  But some movie-goers might be asking, when seeing the trailer for 50 First Dates, `Haven't we seen this before?' Yes, Sandler's new romantic comedy is being released on the exact same day as The Wedding Singer was five years ago, complete with Drew Barrymore as his love interest . Is Sandler in a desperate effort for the good days that film sparked? Possibly, especially after moderate hits like Mr. Deeds and Anger Management and flat-out flops such as Little Nicky and Eight Crazy Nights. Could it be that the movie-going public is getting the same romantic comedy, only repackaged? Maybe Sander is becoming too commercial but only box office numbers will tell.The story follows a young man who falls in love with a beautiful woman who can never truly love him back thanks to her short-term memory loss. Henry Roth is the ultimate stereotypical ladies' man who woos young women tourists, shows them a good time, but dumps them soon after the have sex. The problem is that Henry has a serious problem with commitment, especially after his college sweetheart dumped for a guidance counselor, and that is why he can never fall in love with a native Hawaiian girl but that all changes when he meets Lucy. He meets her in small restaurant and they seem to hit it off right away but when Henry meets the next day at the same restaurant, she doesn't remember him at all. He learns from one of her friends that Lucy was involved in a car accident a year ago and lost her short-term memory from that point on. Lucy's father and brother try and protect her from men who know of her condition and are just looking for a one night stand but Henry is adamantly determined to make her remember him, no matter it takes. The story for 50 First Dates is . well, you don't know what it is, really. It feels like a combination of Groundhog's Day, The Wedding Singer, and Joe Versus the Volcano, all packed into one film but leaving nothing but mixed reactions. It's hard to tell what the filmmakers really wanted from this film as if they couldn't decided whether they wanted an emotional drama or romantic comedy and, in the end, they just decided to splice the two genres together and make whatever it came out to be.The two leading stars of The Wedding Singer are back in this new film but the question is whether or not they still have the same on-screen chemistry they had five years ago. And the answer would be, yes, but separately, they are on different ends of the spectrum. Adam Sandler, who started his movie career off with such wacked-out comedies as Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore, seems to have matured greatly since his early years as a comedian and has expressed some interesting acting talent on-screen. How is 50 First Dates different for him? For one, he isn't blowing up with anger like all his other films and, second, he continues his level of serious performances in comedies like in Big Daddy. It seems his dramatic performance in Paul Anderson's Punch-Drunk Love did him some real good, which he shows off in the more emotional aspects of the feature. Drew Barrymore, best known for her role in Steven Spielberg's E.T., has really grown up since her early roles but hasn't improved much in the area of her performances. Granted she demonstrates real chemistry with Sandler, but alone she doesn't give anything better then her lower-browed romantic comedy roles like in Riding in Cars with Boys or Never Been Kissed. And, whether this was intentional or not, Barrymore manages to slut up an emotional good-bye between her and Sandler in the rain by not wearing a bra and bearing her soaked breasts, even if only for a few seconds. Not trying to hark back to the Super Bowl, but this shows a serious level of immaturity, if intentionally placed.Overall, true romantics will find this predictable premise delightful while others will be wishing they had short-term memory loss. The biggest problem for the film is its lack of consistency, in that there is no balance between its heart-warming emotional sequences and its, at times, gut-wrenching comedic moments. While on the subject, were scenes like the barfing walrus or the butt flecking from Sean Austin (never thought you ever hear that, right?) absolutely necessary? Not to say it was all gross-out humor, 50 First Dates manages to actually pack in a relatively decent amount of hilarious highlights that weren't featured in the film's trailer, unlike Sandler's last film, Anger Management. Note, though, the use of the word 'decent' as several comedic scenes went off without even the slightest giggle. And though the film comes in at a not-too-bad one hour and thirty-six minutes, the repetitive story elements makes it feel at least thirty minutes longer then it actually is. If you are neither a fan of romantic comedies or Adam Sandler, save yourself the sixteen bucks (along with an additional fifteen for snacks) and take your girl to a play or a musical or something more entertaining then this.My Rating: *** ½ out of 5 (Grade: C+)",7,4,15,13 February 2004
Catch Me If You Can," The Moose Hole - 'Catch' This 'If You Can'
","There are few directors out there that can make a great film but it is even rarer for a director to make two great films in one year. Steven Spielberg will try to be one of those rare directors. Earlier this year, Spielberg directed the critically praised Minority Report, which gathered more praise for its box office battle with Disney's Lilo & Stitch then anything else. Now after directing box office draw Tom Cruise, Steven Spielberg attempts to breathe new box office life into the career of Leonardo DiCaprio by adding the mix of Oscar winning actor, Tom Hanks. Will this experiment work and showcase the reasons why Spielberg is one of the greatest directors in Hollywood or will this one of the very few flaws in his career?The story goes that Frank Abagnale Jr. lives a normal life with his parents but things begin to change very quickly. His family moves to a small apartment after his father runs into trouble with the IRS. Frankie's parents soon divorce after his mother begins to cheat on her husband. This drives the confused boy to run away from home. Frank makes a good life for himself by disguising himself as an airline pilot becoming the James Bond of the skies. But he runs from that job after an FBI agent named Carl Hanratty begins the chase to capture him. Hanratty will go to the ends of the earth just to catch him. The story, which was based on a true story, was well done but felt too weighted. Some of the elements seemed too unbelievable for the audience to really accept. And some areas of the story seemed to last too long that in the end they felt flat for the most part.The characters in the film were all based on real life people. Leonardo DiCaprio plays the lead character, Frank Abagnale Jr. It really wasn't much of a stretch for him to play a ladies' man but it had been some time since he played a character that was like the one he plays here. Frank Abagnale Jr. is a confused character who continues the chase not because he loves it but that he needs it. He needs the cat and mouse game with Agent Hanratty to fill that void he is missing with his family. DiCaprio shows great acting ability especially in the end expressing this character. Agent Hanratty is not an Oscar winning performance for Tom Hanks but it is a character which seems like he had a lot of fun with. Christopher Walken is great as Frank Abagnale Sr. playing off Leonardo DiCaprio very well especially in facial expressions. It is a shame that his character is not given a good send off in the film rather then the plain ending his character gets.Overall, Catch Me If You Can is another good offering from the creative genius of Steven Spielberg but certainly not one of his greatest. The film is certainly a great diversion from the usual dramatic films offered by Spielberg but Catch Me really seems slow and flat in certain areas of the film. Some of the characters were flat in some areas. Christopher Walken's character is great but sent off in a good way. At least there should have been something there for the audience for feel sorry for when his son is told his father is dead. Jennifer Garner's character, though nicely performed by the Alias star, seemed pointless in the overall effect of the film. Catch Me If You Can is a nice film, though, for people to relax in without having to waste a very long time with or being too blown away with elaborate special effects. Catch this film, if you can. If not, don't worry too much about it.My Rating: **** out of 5",8,0,1,12 January 2003
Friday Night Lights," The Moose Hole - Review of Friday Night Lights
","There are numerous genres and film concepts that Hollywood rarely touches, some of which have changed the minds and perspectives of the studio executives with their recent, and ultimately shocking, successes. The pirate genre, for example, was deemed the poison of the box office after such expensive flops as Cutthroat Island starring Gena Davis with the recent animated film Treasure Planet seeming to confirm that fact but once Pirates of the Caribbean crossed the coveted $300 million mark domestically, no one seems to know what to do now with the genre. And the firefighter genre, barely explored extensively since Backdraft, Ladder 49 has performed admirably at the box office thus far. Another genre that had taken a few hits was the sports-drama, more specifically in the area of football. Rarely had the genre been explored as extensively as it is now, and even fewer successes were created outside of a few comedies here and there (the Waterboy being the only true success of them all), but after the surprising long-run success of Remember the Titans in Fall 2000, the movie studios are scrambling to come up with ideas to produce a football film. Here's hoping it's just as entertaining as the game itself  people can dream, can't they?The story is based on the now-ten year old novel by H.G. Bissinger entitled 'Friday Night Lights', which Sports Illustrated described as one of the greatest sports stories of all time. In 1988, the small bumpkin town of Odessa, Texas is practically for sale with little high-interest business in the area and plenty of drunks to make the liquor industry exuberant for years. With life as it is, no wonder the only joy they seem to find out of the few months out of the year derives from the town's high-school football team, the Permian High Panthers, whose aspirations are to go undefeated and win the state championship. Then again, that's what the football fanatics of the town say year in and year out, season after season. This year may be different with the star of the football team, nicknamed Booby, leading the charge through every position you can think of on the football field. All hopes are dashed when that star running-back injuries his knee and appears to be out for the season, if not the rest of his potential college career. When the Panthers lose to a district rival, their first hope of going undefeated is destroyed and as the season drags on through the fall they find it harder each time to maintain that aspiration to acquiring the state championship, let alone getting into the playoffs. Off the grid-iron, each player seems to have his own personal conflicts to deal with, some of which deal heavily into their playing ability on the field and how their season may end. If they have any chance what-so-ever to achieve the ultimate goal of becoming the state champions then they must put off their personal disputes and unite as a team to become perfect in their own minds, whether they win or lose. The story for Friday Night Lights, regardless of whether it was good on print or in real life, is an absolute abomination on screen, plain and simple. This film can't hold a candle to the majesty of Remember the Titans, one of the best, if not THE best, sports films of all time. The thing about that film was there was a whole different aspect to the actions on screen besides football, namely racial tension of the 1960s. The press release made it sound like there was a religious connotation, instead you get one stinkin' Our Father (no offense what-so-ever to Catholicism) relatively near the end of the movie and apparently that makes it a religiously affiliated sports film  once again, this is another area Remember the Titans trumps it in.Though the film's primary focus is the community on the whole, there are few, if any true, stand out performances in this film that will stick with audiences members long after they have left the theater. Billy Bob-Thorton is the obvious standout amongst the cast of this film and even with as vivid a performance as he gives, he appears to be greatly underused. The problem does not lie with Thorton himself but rather the direction the filmmakers fail to take the movie toward. With films like Remember the Titans, you at least got some what of an in-depth approach toward the personal lives of the coaches off the battlefield. With Gary Gaines, you barely get a foot-hold into what the man's life was really like. This isn't to say they should have made a film primarily focused on his biography but they could have given the audience more material then they did. The most anyway, outside of the ones who have read the book, could have gotten from this film about him was that he was a high-school football coach, had a wife and a daughter  Deep! Jay Hernandez serves no point in this film, just as he did appearing all too briefly in another recent release, Ladder 49. This is a shame after the young actor gave two engaging performances in crazy/beautiful and another sports drama, The Rookie, so would think he would get better, if not broader, roles from studios but apparently that didn't happen. Derek Luke's Booby (why would anyone take a nickname like that, let alone a successful player) is a character you just love to hate. There are those who say you should never be envious or spiteful to those that have the ability or the talent to do the things they can do, such as Booby did on the playing field, but when one such as this individual do so with not just pride but extreme arrogance, they often get brought down to earth with a thud as they should. And Tim McGraw, the well-known country music sensation, branches further into the movie industry with a supporting-role in Friday Night Lights and gives an intense, if not partially disengaging, performance. The real problem wasn't with him specifically but with the way the relationship between the father and the son wrapped up too neatly and without much incident, which seemed awkward compared to what was previously seen on screen. Had more information been provided on how McGraw's character sunk to the position he was in then perhaps there would be a better understanding, though not to say this would excuse his behavior in the least.Overall, Sports Illustrated once called the novel from which this film is based the greatest sports story of all time and you can't help but have further disrespect for the magazine then after witnessing for your own eyes the travesty that is Friday Night Lights. Peter Berg's stylized, and often awkwardly close-up, camera direction may have worked splendidly in The Rundown but it doesn't here. There's may be saying that if you look into a person's eyes you are staring into their souls but when Berg does it with the characters of this film, all you see bloodshot eyeballs and a lot of sweat. Another key concept a brilliant film needs to grasp is the idea of transition  a smooth, seamless transition from one scene to the next, even if one scene is critical and the next isn't. The problem with Berg is that he doesn't do that anywhere within this film. He'll have a critical scene (for example, the boy's drunken father catching his son practically having sex with this girl and duck-taping a football to his hands  you'll have to see the film to get it, so don't freak out), play it out and then just awkwardly end it in order to move on to the next scene. He didn't do this once, this happen frequent throughout the film and confuses the audience easily. Without giving away the film's ending, let's speak plainly and say it made the entire previous two hours of this movie definitively meaningless. It's hard to describe the feeling without giving anything away but once you see that dialogue on that screen right at the end of the film, you'll know it. Bottom-line, there's was just no connection between what was occurring on screen and the audience. Perhaps those who have played the game of football will feel a more powerful connection or have a much broader understanding of the players and supporting characters on screen then the average Joe, who spent better time hitting the books then the dirt, but (and if this is getting tiring then this shows how bad this film is) Remember the Titans was able to appeal to not only that specific group but a wide demographic as well without losing its message. Here, there may be a message but the mainstream audience doesn't get it, so it's like it never existed.My Rating: ** out of 5 (Grade: D)",4,1,2,9 October 2004
Underworld," The Moose Hole - Review of Underworld
","`But, soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.  Rise up, beautiful sun, and make the jealous moon invisible.'One of the most popular of Shakespeare's plays, Romeo and Juliet, has been transformed into many different feature films; some good (the 1968 version) and some bad (the 1996 version starring Leonardo DiCaprio). But the main point is that this enduring tale of two star-crossed lovers (which, in reality, Shakespeare ripped off) has been able to stand the test of time, be passed on to future generations and has been embraced as much as it has ever been. Now a more different (really different) version has emerged with werewolves and vampires taking the place of the feuding families the Montagues and the Capulets. But Screen Gem's gothic take on the famous tale is much more loosely based then previous versions. How loosely based? At press time there was already talk of a sequel. William Shakespeare must be rolling in his grave right now.Underworld is loosely based on Romeo and Juliet with werewolves and vampires, two feuding clans, battling for supremacy. Selene, a vampire, is a `Death Dealer', an armed assassin who hunts down the Lycans, also known as werewolves. For centuries the war between the vampires and the Lycans has been raging on outside of the knowledge of the human race but that may all change with new rumblings in the underworld. Selene soon becomes infatuated with a human named Michael, who becomes the focus of a secret plot by the Lycans to resurrect their dying species. Why is this such a big deal? The integration of these two rivaling species is strictly forbidden but such an event could end the war. Why would anyone not want this? Selene believes that there are secrets within both clans that push the classic theme of appearance vs. reality. The story of Underworld is intriguing to say the least but gets too caught up in itself to make truly any sense. There are many surprising twists and turns in the plot but so many that the feature becomes bogged down and just plain confusing by the end of its two hour run. And talk about being `loosely' based! The filmmakers claim that Underworld is based on Romeo and Juliet with two members of feuding clans coming together in blissful love but outside of that, the similarities end pretty quickly. And even that similarity isn't well based with any romantic interests between the two main characters being pretty flat and disconnected.The cast is full of wonderful actors and actresses but few famous faces to bring in even a built in audience. Kate Beckinsale, who saw her star power rise dramatically after her role in the 2001 hit Pearl Harbor, is obviously the main focus of the feature and does a wonderful job with her time in the spotlight or lack of light. Beckinsale gives an uber-sexy performance as Selene that may give another leather clad actress, Carrie-Ann Moss, a run for her money in that area. The only problem with her character is that little detail is given to her character's past and even when those details are available, they aren't explored in flashback sequences, which would have relieved some confusion in the plot. Scott Speedman, best known for performance on the late Felicity series on the WB television network, does a best a performance as he can give but as important as his character is to the plot of the film, he really isn't given anything to show off his true acting chops. Bill Nighy, who plays the ancient vampire leader Viktor, gives an entertaining performance that was still quite interesting despite the fact that he doesn't appear till relatively late in the film. The only upsetting fact of the character is the way he dies, which seemed like a slap in the face to the fine performer who worked so hard to set up an engaging character only to be kicked down so quickly.Overall, Underworld is an insult to the famous play on which it is based, no matter how loosely it is. Poor William Shakespeare must be rolling in his grave! The idea seemed to an interesting one, so what went wrong? A lot of things. Despite having a decent two hour time length, Underworld becomes too bloated by the midway point that by the end, it just gives up and rolls downhill. The plot has too many twists and turns to get a clear understanding of what is going on and ends with more questions then answers. How did the vampires and werewolves start out? How were the werewolves able to evolve so that they could change at random? Why is it the werewolves and vampires seem to have this all out war against each other going on for centuries without the knowledge the human race? Some of those answers may be present in the feature but the main focus becomes so confusing that anything else is pushed out of your mind to even ponder. And even though this is a horror/monster film, Screen Gem could have taken the blood factor down a notch or two as there were too many unnecessary squeamish moments for some to take especially after gobbling down a full bucket of popcorn. The action sequences are well done, though the filmmakers seem to borrow too many elements from The Matrix series to make them even slightly original. So despite an excellent performance by Kate Beckinsale and well choreographed action sequences, Underworld comes off as being too long, grim and confusing to recommend above superior fall fare like Once Upon a Time in Mexico.My Rating: *** out of 5 (Grade: C+)",6,0,0,20 September 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," The Moose Hole - Review of Pirates of the Caribbean
","The Walt Disney Company, which has been known for family fun and entertainment, has had moderate success at the box office with their animated films and pre-teen oriented live action films. Unfortunately they have not had the success of franchises like Harry Potter or the Lord of the Rings. Disney has been so desperate for a hit lately that they have dug not only into their archives and remaking some of their classic films like Freaky Friday but they have attempted to make film versions of their famous Disneyland attractions. Their first attempt at making the cross over from attraction to film, The Country Bears, was an embarrassment. The film barely (pardon the pun) pulled in $16 million in its entire run against a production budget of $20 million. Not only was the film a financial failure but a critical one as well. The studio hopes to bounce back from that failure with the film version of Pirates of the Caribbean. Pirates is helmed by Gore Verbinski, director of the horror hit The Ring, and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. Not only that but it stars Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp with special effects created by Industrial Light and Magic. How could it fail? Quite easily. The film is about pirates and pirates have been deemed box office poison for years. Look at Disney's Treasure Planet as a most recent example. So can the good aspects out weigh the bad and break the pirate curse or will all this `yo ho, ho' be just a `bottle of rum'?The story follows the adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate who seems to be low on his luck. It all started when he crew created mutiny on his ship nearly ten years ago and left him deserted on an island in the middle of the Caribbean. Ever since then he has been moving from place to place searching for the Black Pearl. It is just by coincidence that he is captured on the same island where the last piece of cursed treasure is located. What cursed treasure? The treasure of Cortez that was stolen by the crew, lead by Captain Barbossa, that mutinied nearly ten years ago. The problem is that treasure was cursed and unless the treasure is returned, these men will be the living undead. They will turn into skeletons at night but look human in the daylight. They will also be unable to eat, drink, sleep, or even feel until the curse is broken. WillTurner, a blacksmith of the town, joins with Captain Jack after Barbossa and his crew kidnaps his true love, Elizabeth Turner. But there are more mysterious reasons for Turner to follow the Black Pearl that involve Captain Jack Sparrow as well. The story for The Curse of the Black Pearl is an exciting one though there are many holes in it. Those holes always seem to appear in the scripts of Bruckheimer films, so this film seems to be no different. It is best just to ignore those holes in the plot and sit back to enjoy a great action flick. One has to admit, though, that the dialogue within the film was much more serious then previous Bruckheimer films which indicate he is learning to mature his film making.The cast for Pirates of the Caribbean is very well put together. Johnny Depp, who has worked on Sleepy Hollow and Edward Scissorhands, is probably the best feature of the film outside the special effects. Depp makes the role of Captain Jack Sparrow his very own and presents a style to him that makes you want to trust him but knowing he is a pirate tells you to be wary. The comedic timing presented Depp is absolutely perfect and works very well in every scene he is in. Depp performs so well that you feel an emotional connection to him that makes the ending all the more intense. Orlando Bloom, who is best known for his role in The Lord of the Rings series, does a good job as Will Turner. There are still some questions about the character that remain unanswered at the end of the film but that has more to do with the script then with Bloom's performance. Geoffrey Rush is absolutely devilish as Captain Barbossa. He presents a style that is both charming and creepy at the same time, which works exceedingly well in this film. Keira Knightly, who had a breakout role in Bend It like Beckham, does a wonderful job as Elizabeth Swann, the governor's daughter who is much tougher then most would think. The remainder of the cast is perfect for the most part. The only role that seems out of place is Governor Swann, played by Jonathan Pryce. There just seemed to be too little of the character and when the character is shown, he doesn't do anything for the scenes. He is just a mere distraction that doesn't work very well.Overall, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is probably one of the best action flicks of the year. There may be a lot of holes in the plot of the story and at moments there may be no point to certain sword fights, but that doesn't seem to matter at all. The special effects, created by Industrial Light and Magic, are the most amazing CGI work that has been seen in quite awhile. The skeletons look absolutely astounding and look even better in the final fight sequence of the film. The musical score for the picture is very original and works so well. Altogether everything seems to come together for the film and presents a delightful action flick that is so rare these days. There were very few problems for the film. The only one that can be thought of right away is the time length. At a time of two hours and twenty minutes, the film seems a bit too longer for the audience that it is intended for but that is a small squabble compared to overall effect of the film. Not a theatrical classic but an out and out good popcorn action flick for the whole family.My Rating: ****1/2 out of 5 (Grade: A)",9,0,1,10 July 2003
Spider-Man 2," The Moose Hole - Review of Spider-Man 2
","You would think a sequel to one of the highest grossing films of all time, sixth on the list once Shrek 2 swings past it sometime this summer, would have an easier road to completion but what kind of challenge would that be for the Amazing Spider-Man? As the original film was racking in nearly $115 million in cash at the box office and smashing every box office record in the book, the ink was drying on the deal to develop two sequels for the comic-book superhero, with more to come gathering that the profit margin was still worth the high production price for Columbia Pictures. Unfortunately production for the highly anticipated sequel didn't start off on the right foot with Tobey Maguire, fresh off his new horse-racing drama, Seabiscuit, holding up the film's start date due to complaints about back problems. It didn't take long for the rumors to start churning out possible replacements, among which was the boyfriend of Kirsten Dunst, Jake Gyllenhaal. But, like the web-slinger he plays on the big screen, Tobey bounced back and in a small way, though inadvertently, he demonstrated one of the film's prominent themes.The story picks up near where the last film left off, only several months in difference, with Peter Parker balancing his personal life and the life of New York's favorite web crawler, Spider-Man. No one said the life of a superhero was going to be easy, though no one said it was going to be quite this hard either. Peter Parker tries as hard as he can to live a normal life but every time he's handed the opportunity to keep his promises, whether it be showing up to Mary Jane's performances, performing his job correctly or paying the rent, the role of Spider-Man gets in the way, thus allowing the one's that depend on him to suffer. As Peter does all he can to balance his two lives, those in the real world are moving on with theirs  Mary Jane, tired of waiting for Peter to admit his true feelings for her, plans to marry the son of J.J. Jameson, a handsome and successful astronaut. Aunt May, struggling after the death of her husband, falls behind on her house payments and faces eviction from the bank if the late payments are met. Even his best friend, Harry Osborne, has moved on and taken over operations at Oscorp  but the anger left by the death of his father at the hands of Spider-Man still remains and threatens to push him over the edge. The family business is all that keeps him on the level of sanity and Harry has big plans for Dr. Otto Octavius' new device to create and control fusion power, which, in essence, puts the power of the stars in the hands of mankind. But in a freak accident which results in the death of Octavius' wife and the fusion of the mechanical arms to his spine, Octavius goes on a rampage to finish his work, possibly taking half the city with him if he fails again. Just as he is beginning to enjoy the retirement he has taken from the superhero life, Peter Parker must again put on the suit and fulfill the promise he made to protect the innocent and bring justice to those who deserve it.The story for Spider-Man 2, though flawed, is without a doubt one of the best comic-book adaptations ever put on screen and excels beyond the expectations set not only by the original but every comic-book franchise that has come before it, including that of the winged one himself, Batman. As was said previously, the storyline is far from perfect and there are some noticeable flaws. Among them, the whole discussion of fusion power between Doctor Otto Octavius and Peter Parker in which they use strange and complex scientific vocabulary and theories is lost on the majority the movie-going public, unless you happen to be on the same level as these individuals but to be sure such people would be few and far between. Granted these individuals are meant to be in sync with the subject of science but since the discussion is so obscure, the audience is just meant to trust what they say, which takes away some of the attachment they are meant to have with the story. And there are moments within the film that seem to last a little longer then some would like them to, and, in part, seem to drag the film a bit, but they are easily forgivable.Most, if not all, of the cast from the original film are back for another go-around and there is substantial improvement in their performances from the last time we saw them, though that can not be said of everyone. One performance that fails to disappoint is once again given by Tobey Maguire in the lead role of Peter Parker, or better known as Spider-Man. The non-superhero side of the character appears to get more screen time then in the original which isn't a bad thing. Maguire is given a lot more room to demonstrate emotionally what the character of Peter Parker is going through; at one end attempting to fulfill the promise he made to his Uncle Ben in the role of Spider-Man while at the same time trying to lead the life of a normal human being. Kirsten Dunst, returning to the role of Mary Jane Watson, gives another wonderful performance by maintaining the 'girl next door' charm she had in the original film but at the same time demonstrating a character that is desperately yearning for something more. Crafted in such the perfect manner, Mary Jane is not another dimwitted damsel in distress as the connection between Spider-Man and Peter Parker slowly begins to develop in her mind. It's hard to say who's the better villain, the Green Goblin (who could forget that terrible costume) or Doc Ock, but even if Doctor Octavius' performance wasn't quite what everyone may have wanted it to be, Alfred Molina fits properly into the role. The only truly bad mark out of the entire cast belongs to James Franco, who drops the ball with his over the top and, at times, flat-out ridiculous performances as Harry Osborne. Rather the see the slow transformation of his impeding insanity, the audience notices the unbalanced behavior of Harry right off the bat and don't really sympathize with his situation, though the understanding of who his father really was may be also to blame. And just when you thought he was gone for good  don't miss the quick, though wonderfully developed, cameo of William Dafoe as Norman Osborn, which, in turn, hints at the possible villain for the third film.Overall, Spider-Man 2 delivers most of what the hype and promotion promise, not only in the areas of spectacular special effects and an emotionally driven storyline, but in the film's enduring message of heroism and self-sacrifice. Before rounding off what made this sequel the fulfilling feature it was, let's focus on items that failed to live up to the rest of the film. First, the random shots of normal civilians, though some well placed, were mainly an annoyance. There is one specific shot, when Spider-Man (costume and all) makes his first appearance, where a woman shouts, 'You go, Spidey!'  this was humorous for the wrong reason and should have been left out, along with the several long focus shots of people screaming and running in terror. Not that they weren't needed but it was the amount of time Raimi used to focus on them that was the problem. Secondly, as was said earlier, it hard to determine whether the Green Goblin or Doctor Octavius is the better villain as Doc Ock isn't nearly as menacing as Goblin was, though he does offer up more action packed fight sequences in return. Depending on how you felt with the first film, this feature's villain could go either way. Third, some of the sequel's more subtle jokes, namely the homage to Butch Casidy and the Sundance Kid, are lost on the majority of the film's target audience, though they are quite humorous to those that know what they are referring to. And finally, the film's final sequence, in which the audience sees Spider-Man swinging between two helicopters over the rooftops of Manhattan on his way to another crime scene, is quite possibly one of the worse computer animated sequences presented this year and is a severe disappointment considering the sensational sequence the last film ended with. The problem is that the computer graphics are way too obvious and ends the film on quite a sour note considering most of the effects presented in the film were spectacular.Though the problems of Spider-Man 2 seem to significantly out weigh the good, the film's emotionally driven messages of self-sacrifice and heroism are what truly set this one apart from all the rest. Where the first film hammers the idea that even the most unlikely of individuals in this world can be heroes, the sequel drills home the belief that there is a hero is every one of us  we just have to make the choice listen to the voice that lets it shine through if it means we have to give up on the things we want the most in life. It's easy to relate the idea of self-sacrifice with the fire and police departments of this country after the tragic events of September 11th but there is another aspect that many of us as Americans fail to respect or even recognize. Right now thousands of American troops are deployed overseas, either in Afghanistan or Iraq, bringing about freedom and opportunity in parts of the world that have not experienced such fundamental principles for over three decades  they are risking their lives not only for the protection of the American people but to further the causes our founding fathers endowed upon us nearly three centuries ago. It is obvious that there are polarizing views in this country on the conflicts we find ourselves in but there once was a time in America's history where the people of this land looked upon the self-sacrificing men and women of the armed forces with respect and admiration, and, in a slightly smaller way, they still do today. But there are also the people who view these true 'heroes' with anger and hatred, not understanding nor having the will to accept the good they are doing in the world, despite what many may say. Symbolism of this can be found in Spider-Man 2 and, like in the comic book adaptation, we believe that a time will come when frustration and hatred can be washed away to fully understand the reasoning behind their sacrifice, as well as the sacrifice of every 'superhero' in this world  to bring justice to those that deserve it.My Rating: **** ½ out of 5 (Grade: A)",9,0,1,30 June 2004
Finding Nemo," The Moose Hole - Review of Finding Nemo
","You can always count on a Pixar film to create loads of family fun as parents and children alike take some time off their busy schedules to enjoy another one of their features. They sure have a great record for it. They began with the surprise hit Toy Story, which started the long-standing trend of computer animated films. They followed with A Bug's Life in 1998, Toy Story 2 in 1999 and Monsters Inc. in 2001. Pixar outperforms each of their previous efforts which is very rare in the modern Hollywood scene. Now, after taking a year off, they take audiences to the ocean in Finding Nemo. But how well will the film do? This is the first time a Pixar film has been placed during the summer time (all previous efforts had been released in November) but this allows for more success with children finishing school. Another problem for the film is lack of voice talent. Monsters Inc. had the advantage of John Goodman and Billy Crystal in the leading roles but the voices for this film are less known. This doesn't matter to children but it can be for some adults.  The question is whether Finding Nemo can continue Pixar's trend of success or will be the film be sunk by the competition?The story goes that Marlin, an orange and white striped clownfish, lives with his son Nemo, who has a 'lucky' fin that is smaller then his other fin, in the ocean near Australia. Marlin is very cautious after the death of his wife and fears for the safety of his son. He fears so much that follows his son on a field-trip on his first day of school. Nemo, who seems embarrassed by his father's over-protective behavior, swims to a boat as dare to prove that he is not like his father. But this courage gets him in trouble as he is captured by a scuba-diver and taken away to a dentist's office in Australia. Marlin goes on a rapid search for his only son and along the way he meets a variety of colorful characters. Among those are Dory, a blue fish with short-term memory loss, Bruce, a shark who forms a club for vegetarian sharks, and Crush, a surfer talking turtle. Marlin will go to any length to find his son and bring him home even if it means facing his own fears head on. Like all previous films, Finding Nemo's story is far superior to most animated films though, it can be said, it is not totally perfect. Much like A Bug's Life, which was also directed by Andre Stanton, the story tends to drag a bit in parts making it less consistent then Toy Story or Monsters Inc.As previously stated, the voice cast for Finding Nemo is less well-known then most Pixar films, which gives it another similarity toward A Bug's Life. Albert Brooks gives a perfect timid voice to the character Marlin. Brooks, who is also appearing in the In-Laws currently, deserves more attention for his role in this film then he is currently getting. He presents sarcastic humor at the right time with this characters as well as emotion which makes you feel for him as he struggles to find his son. Ellen DeGeneres is absolutely delightful as the forgetful Dory. The funniest moments in the film come from her characters especially the hilarious scene where she tries to speak whale. Some of the most thought provoking moments come from her character as well, which is ironic coming from a fish with short-term memory loss. William Dafoe is wonderfully cast as Gill, who tries to help Nemo escape from the dentist's office fish-tank. Geoffrey Rush, who stars in Pirates of the Caribbean later this summer, is humorous as the pelican but most of his most funny scenes had been seen in the trailers. And Pixar regular, John Ratzenburg, is great as the school of fish that poke fun at Marlin and teach him to lighten up.Overall, Finding Nemo is another great film from the folks at Pixar but not their best work. The visuals are the best that have ever been seen in an animated film, that is for sure, but the story is not as hilarious as Monsters Inc. was. The story also tends to drag a bit in parts which makes it quite inconsistent. Finding Nemo also seemed to have a lot more intense scenes then most films aimed toward children, which is better for the older crowd but is sure to frighten some children. But the spectacular visuals, the delightful characters and those Pixar tributes to famous films make this a must-see anyway. The best family film to date and looks to be for quite some time.My Rating: ****1/2 out of 5 (Grade: A-)",9,1,2,30 May 2003
Alexander," The Moose Hole - Review of Alexander
","Hollywood right now seems to be in the middle of a great revitalization of the swords and sandals genre once a prominent staple of the golden age of cinema with such classics as Ben-Hur and Spartacus. After being caught nearly off-guard by the Best Picture win of Gladiator at the Academy Awards in early 2001, major movie studios put the fast track on projects they once thought would never be made, including a large budgeted adaptation of the fall of Troy. Continuing with the subject matter of ancient historical figures and events, controversial filmmaker Oliver Stone, whose recent gushing documentary on communist dictator Fidel Castro received mixed reviews among critics and the public, has put his ten year plan of bringing the life of Alexander the Great to the big screen into action. He has had a lot to compete with in recent years including three others Alexander based projects developed just in the last few years  two of the most notable ones being the Martin Scorsese directed feature starring Leonardo DiCaprio and the ten episode HBO miniseries produced by Mel Gibson called Fire from Heaven. Leave it to Stone to continue making headlines, this time with rumors of the film's unconventional portrayal of the most influential figure in the history of Western Civilization  as a homosexual.The story follows the eight years of constant warfare led against most of the known world by one man that would alter the course of Western Civilization forever. Born in July 356 B.C. (his exact date of birth has never been precisely determined) as son to Philip II of Macedonia and Olympias, Alexander was destined for greatness. After the assassination of his father, a plot many historians believe was conspired by Olympias, Alexander forced rebel barbarians in northern Macedonia out of the country and brought Greek city states such as Thebes and Athens under his control. Seeking revenge for the invasion of Greece in 490 B.C. by the Persian Empire, Alexander then set his sights east battling King Darius of Persia for control of the vast territory. After chasing King Darius for several years, Alexander arrived in Persepolis and discovered the dead body of the conquered ruler, apparently betrayed by his own men. Alexander enforced a blending of the Greek and Persian cultures instead of stripping each conquered nation of its cultural identity, which had been a staple of military conquest at the time of his invasion. This led to the spreading and vast acceptance of Greek culture throughout most of the known world, the most supreme and lasting influence Alexander's conquests had on the world. By the relatively young age of twenty-seven, Alexander the Great had conquered about ninety percent of the known world. Unsatisfied with simply conquering the Persian Empire, Alexander continued east into India but turned back home after one of the bloodiest battles his military campaign had yet encountered in their eight years of fighting. Despite being described as god-like figure, some say even a god himself, Alexander the Great met an inglorious demise, dying of a fever on June 10th, 323 B.C. The story for Alexander should be a shining example for future generations of intrepid writers on how not to pen an epic historical drama. In all honesty, Pearl Harbor's extravagantly clichéd storyline was far more engaging then this overblown snooze-fest. Granted this is an adaptation of some rather heavy-handed events in history that altered the course of civilization as we know it but the tone of the entire feature, including its less then important subject matters, can only be describe as being too austere to be taken with a straight face. The linguistic tone of the film's dialogue is so overblown as to be inadvertently laughable, a screen writing debacle that was obvious in another epic disaster earlier this year, Troy.What is with Hollywood when it comes to making films about either the Greeks or the Romans? Does every actor and actress in these grand-scale epics have to have a British or Irish accent to them? Even Val Kilmer, who clearly isn't a native of the British Isles, has a slight accent to his voice! Other then that minor quip, Kilmer gives an engaging performance of a deeply trouble ruler. Philip II of Macedonia, the father of Alexander, is presented in the film as a disfigured drunkard and womanizer. Though he certainly overly relished in wine and women, there is no evidence to suggest that he was disfigured in anyway. If this is suppose to be a metaphorical device for interpreting his tortured soul or what have you then it should have been better explained through the language of the script as it is blatantly unclear to audiences. Olympias, Alexander's barbarian mother, played by Angelina Jolie, had a profound influence on the young ruler's life and should have had more screen time or more important sequences then what is presented in the film but this isn't of tremendous concern in the end. So little is given on the backgrounds of either one of Alexander's parents that the audience is often forced to interpret certain aspects of the film's story a certain way without any real knowledge as to whether it is correct or not. This isn't so big of a problem but it would have served the flow of the film better had Stone cleared those up a bit more then he did. Stone only alludes to a certain aspect of Alexander's strange life, this time his Oedipal attraction to his mother which greatly affected his sexual preferences throughout the rest of his life. Colin Farrell, despite his Irish accent intact throughout the film, really showcases his acting chops in this film, if anyone hadn't noticed already in Tigerland, Phone Booth, or Minority Report. Sporadically throughout the film director Oliver Stone alludes to Alexander the Great's supposedly homosexual preferences especially with his best friend Hephaestion, with whom it is well-documented the ruler had a close relationship with whatever that may be interpreted as. Unfortunately, despite the general acceptance by historians that Alexander had a preference for men, there has been no recorded evidence available to this point to suggest that the Macedonian ruler ever had a sexual encounter with any males of that time period, let alone his best friend Hephaestion. If those were more accepting times as Stone claims then there would be indication of so-called affairs but to date there has been no such discovery in any documents written about him. Whether you agree with the morality of homosexuality or not, one has to admit that Stone's faint allusions to Alexander's sexuality are cowardly at best, offensive at worst. Instead of making simple-minded, and blatantly obvious, allusions to Alexander's sexual antics why don't you just come out and admit to what the man was and not cower to the whim of certain fractions of the general public who may find the idea offensive. This is the simple case of put up or shut up and Stone seems to want to have it both ways, which doesn't bode well with anyone.Overall, Alexander stays true to form of the romanticized image Hollywood has built up about the stylized epic dramas of Oliver Stone, that being that the film is excessively long, tedious, humorless, boundless in the realms of prodigal violence and loose sexual escapades, and its even looser interpretation of the facts of history. In essence, the basic make up of the modern Oscar nominee. Oliver Stone exemplifies in this film a severe problem that has succumbed a fellow socialist filmmaker, Michael Moore, specifically he likes to pick and choose through the piles of facts and theories those that are consistent with his particular line of thinking in order to force onto audiences his propagandist agenda. Yes, Stone did immortalize Alexander the Great as a child, he has stated this numerous times before, and nobody can really blame him for making a film that looks more favorably on his hero then actual history would suggest, but that does not give him a legitimate excuse to alter historical truths to his liking or give a ring of truth to inane conspiracy theories as he did with JFK. Can it be that hard to believe that Alexander, despite his spectacular accomplishments, was actually human and died of the flu or malaria? There is no evidence throughout known records to suggest that a conspiracy was led against Alexander, despite him being paranoid for a good portion of his life with the thought of such a thing, and poison actually being the cause of his death. Oliver Stone can believe whatever he wants but without any crucial evidence to back up his opinions and thoughts, he shouldn't be subjecting his audiences to hearsay and whatnot when that is far from the truth. Regardless of the fact that the film is about one of the greatest military strategists in history who had conquered most of the known world by the age of twenty-seven through countless bloody battles, only two engagements are ever focused on throughout the three-hour marathon, and even the facts of their interpretation have been arranged to the liking of the director, not historical relevance. Though several events depicted in the film are legitimate with historical records of that time, too often they are moved around to better suit the 'vision' of the filmmaker giving an extreme disadvantage to audiences in their understanding of the most influential figure in Western Civilization. Yes, there are certain moments in history that may not be as interesting as if someone jazzed it up a bit but this is supposed to be better? At least in school you had the school bell to look forward to liberating you from utter boredom, if you were that kind of person. Even if you were one of those individuals who got a kick out of reading up on history, you'll be wishing for that bell halfway through this deathtrap.",4,0,3,25 November 2004
Troy," The Moose Hole - Review of Troy
","When go to your local book store or library, what do you see? There's the Da Vinci Code, the latest Harry Potter book, quite possibly the latest thriller from Stephen King, and of course the latest crap-trap bashing the Bush administration (How many more of these damn things can there be? Hasn't it all been said by now? Or are some holding out for more money?). But what you won't see out in the front, or even in reasonable view, are the ancient myths, from both the Greek and the Roman eras. These stories, which were passed down from generation to the next by word of mouth alone for centuries, showcases the greatest heroes, the greatest villains, and the most enduring lessons man has encompassed into his society. Whether you heard these as a young boy from your parents or studying them in grade school (or in the case of public schools, even high school), these were the tales to live up to, to base moral values on, and to heed the examples of men and women who may not have even existed but were told in these stories to serve the benefit of future generations. Anyone can pick up the latest `hot book of the week' but few can say that these will last forever. The true legends, the greatest legends . only they will stand the test of time.The story focuses more on the historical events that took place at the Siege of Troy rather then the mythological aspects, for which the tale is best known by and has been known by for generations. After numerous confrontations and mounting dead, King Agamemnon appears to have his goal of uniting all of Greece under one ruler at hand but there is danger afoot. Helen, wife of King Menelaus of Sparta and brother to King Agamemnon, has been secretly having an affair with Paris, prince of Troy, who has arrived in Sparta along with his brother Hector as ambassadors of peace who seek to unite Greece and squelch the years of fighting. In one fell swoop those hopes are dashed to pieces when Paris sneaks Helen aboard his ship heading back to Troy, thus enraging both Menelaus and Agamemnon to declare on Troy when they refuse to return her. But in order to defeat the Trojans, the Greeks will need the greatest warrior, Achilles, who is stubborn, arrogant, and refuses to bow to any king or ruler and the demands they impose on him. He goes forth into battle only at the expense of achieving ultimate glory, or immortality, amongst the people of the known world. Each individual has his own reason for involving himself in this war but what started as a war of love now stands as a war for honor, pride and the devotion to one's own country and everything its entails. The story for Troy is an absolute disgrace to the legend it claims to be based on. If you go into this film with knowledge of the legend of Troy, one must wonder what they were basing this film on as they manage to miss out on the key aspect of the legend. That key aspect of the story is the mythology (the gods, the magic, the fantasy) that is involved and by taking away that the filmmakers miss out on the whole message that the myth invokes and any credibility that try to sustain by the end.Wolfgang Petersen, director of the film, manages to put together a stellar group of cast members who, more often then not, succeed in presenting entertaining performances in the roles they were assigned but even they can not stop this film from being a near-complete train wreck. There couldn't be a second thought on who to start off with other then the widely promoted Brad Pitt in the role of Achilles, one of the most legendary figures known in mythology. Unfortunately the character in the film is an absolute abomination compared to the legendary warrior that many of us grew up listening about. How could the filmmakers dare even think about taking the greatest warrior of all time (whether he was real or not) and turning him, by the end of the film, into the ultimate pansy? Leave it to a pacifist woman to do that to a man! Who might this be?  Rose Byrne who plays Briseis, cousin to Paris and Hector and vestal virgin given to Achilles as a gift. The character is a total insult to women. She clearly stands against the concept of war, though she never clearly advocates her stance and only gives occasional naïve statements on war, and manages to change Achilles' view on warfare simply by bedding him a few times and manipulating his mind through sensual sex. How insulting! Diana Krueger, who takes on the role of the beautiful Helen of Troy, seems like a waste as she is given little to do outside of being eye candy and acting helpless. There is no emotional depth to the character and the reasons given for her fleeing with Paris are barely even touched on, which demeans from any point the filmmakers could be going for on that angle. And how can anyone have respect for the characters of Paris and Hector, played by Orlando Bloom and Eric Bana, who are played out as cowards and insults to the true warriors, who are for the most part killed off relatively early in the war. Audience members will be clamoring for their deaths after seeing Paris hide behind Hector in his battle with Menelaus, who is practically stabbed in the back by Hector in what is suppose to be a one-on-one fight to the death.Overall . Be forewarned! Those going into Troy looking for a heedfully based and historically tweaked adaptation of the myth are well advised to avert their eyes from this horrendous gorgon. Director Wolfgang Petersen takes the concept of creative liberties and stretches far beyond the reasonable point for any adaptation and in the process severely damages the legend of Troy in the minds of the latest generation of movie-goers, who will go off spreading the inaccurate portrayal to future generations should the film be deemed a success at the box office. The film is just an absolute disgrace and those who have grown well-accustomed to both Greek and Roman mythology should do themselves a favor by avoiding this near monstrosity at all costs, namely in their wallet. There can be no greater insult to mythologists then turning the greatest warrior the world has ever known into the superlative pansy. Even when one looks past that fact, there isn't much more to the film to salvage any respect for the mad scientists behind this hideous creation. The dialogue is overly clichéd and dull, the immense use of CGI effects becoming increasingly embarrassing and more obvious as the film goes on, and the numerous all-to-close naked shots of Brad Pitt become increasingly annoying, more so for the males then the females of course. Without the whole mythology aspect to it, Paris' capturing of `Helen's heart' looks like a booty call gone out of control and only confuses the audience in their attempt interpret what should be taken from this film. If Van Helsing and Troy are any indication of what is to come this summer, this is set to be the worst summer on record at the box office in a long time.My Rating: * ½ out of 5 (Grade: D-)",3,0,3,19 May 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," The Moose Hole - Review of The Day After Tomorrow
","Who would have thought that one of the summer's most anticipated films would become the political lightening rod the liberal activists have made it today? How did this happen? Whether 20th Century Fox or the filmmakers wanted it or not, radical activist groups such as the ever-delusional Moveon.org have openly embraced the film, even going so far as to hold a rally not far from the premiere of the film. Among the speakers that were expected to attend was environmental nut-job himself, Al Gore, who spoke in New York City about the subject of global-warming on the coldest day in over half-a-century. That alone should demonstrate the credibility of these people but they embraced the film none the less, all to no avail to be sure. With less then one-third of the country concerning themselves with the environment, few will find this film to be more then flashy special-effects and unrelenting, if not mindless, destruction.The story centers on the aftermath of global warming as one 'rogue' scientist battles both man-made and natural blockades in order to save his son who is trapped in a now ice-incased New York City. Professor Adrian Hall is one of the leading scientists in his field trying to raise awareness over the growing environmental problem the planet will eventually face in the not too distant future but few will listen. That is until numerous natural disasters begin to engulf the planet. Tornadoes rip through California, snowstorms pound Eastern Asia, and gigantic tidal waves slam into New York City, where his son is attending an academic-decathlon competition. While the rest of the United States heads further south in order to avoid continuing cataclysmic disasters, Adrian Hall is the only one marching north all in an effort to rescue his son and save any hope left for humanity. The story for The Day After Tomorrow is so ridiculously absurd and laughably clichéd that you may actually question the mentality of the radical liberals using this film as a launching pad to resurrect a dying, if not already dead, environmental proposal. To start things off, the film's entire concept, outside of the myth of global-warming being taken for serious fact, is decisively unrealistic. Granted that was the same situation with another Emmerich disaster-flick, Independence Day, but at least that film had a credible script and a group of heroing characters that the audience cared about; something The Day After seriously lacks. The problem lies in the fact that the film becomes tremendously bogged down by so many intertwining characters and their separate story lines that it becomes increasingly difficult for any audience to singularly attach themselves to a particular character within the film which, as a result, makes any actions on screen emotionally-meaningless.The supposed hero of the film is Professor Adrian Hall, played to the best of his abilities by Dennis Quaid. As great of a ruggish actor as Quaid can be, it doesn't fit well with this particular character that is suppose to be a rogue but isn't, in that Hall has to report to someone before any situation even if it concerns the life of his son. While on that subject, why does Hall go to New York after stating just minutes earlier that the best they could do for the people stranded in the area was pray? And supposing he did make it to New York then what did he plan on doing? All communications were out so how was he going to get them out of there? And is it asking too much to question Hall's skills as a scientist? All these freakish weather anomalies are occurring that apply to your theory and yet you let your son go to New York. Does that make sense? And why is it that he is able to have this shocking theory that many slowly begin to accept but only begins collecting data to back it up once the effects of global warming are in full swing? Samuel Hall, played by environmental wacko Jake Gyllenhaal, is a prime example of the typical emotionally depressed teenager always fervent in clichéd films. He mopes because his father isn't around all the time  Boo-hoo! At least he has a father, it's not like his father is dead or his parents are divorced and he's never around. And the story about the 'F' he received for not showing work on his mathematics test and talking back to the teacher  What bull-crap! Show your damn work even if you can do it in your head (to be sure, his teacher isn't the only one in mathematics within the country who enforces such a policy) and don't talk back. It's that simple! And if Sam is as upset with his father as he appears to be, why does he choose to believe his father's promise to get him in New York if he has failed him so many times in the past? Worse-case scenario or not, it doesn't make sense. Overall, Roland Emmerich and his band of disaster-flick cronies dispatch with all concepts of space and time, not to mention any at all scientific merit, in order to achieve their goal of promoting an overly-drawn out environmental agenda so clichéd that by the end of the film's nearly two hour run you'll be saddened to contemplate the thought of this being the last stand of the environmental wackos of the world. If these people so vividly believe the ideas that they promote, why would they ever soil their core beliefs by having them mixed together with over-the-top special effects and bad science that, in the end, contradicts any serious scientific merit they are trying to achieve? Time serves no purpose within the film, although humanity seems to be always short of it whenever the script calls for it to be. In what should take it thousands, if not millions, of years, the cataclysmic effects of global warming unfold before our eyes in a time frame of less then two weeks, though that is a rough estimate as no accurate time line of events is given. Granted things need to fit within a two hour film but even for the sake of global warming even that is a little ridiculous. On top of that, the liberal propaganda machine rolls out a weak excuse to lift current immigration policies via a turning of the tables scenario late within the film. In the future has Mexico gone loco when they are dealing with a global catastrophe and they are more concerned about getting even on immigration policies then saving lives? As was said earlier, The Day After suffers severely from predictable and overly clichéd situations that become more abundantly clear as the movie progresses. So much so that one wonders why not a single studio executive raised the red-flag before letting this get off the drawing-board. Without rambling out an entire list, which would be tediously long, let's say the best, if not the most unnoticed, example lied in the scene in which Sam Hall watches another guy come in and flirt with Laura, the girl he likes, while 'You don't want to hurt me  You don't want to make me cry' plays softly in the background of the cafeteria. And lastly, it is absolutely disturbing to contemplate the filmmakers ever wanting to showcase the destruction of New York City after the destructive event that took place on September 11th, 2001, and yet it is prominent here. Haven't New Yorkers, let alone Americans in general, been through enough that they should witness this on screen? How many damn times does Emmerich have to destroy NYC before he gets his final kicks? Perhaps one day the FBI would like a conversation with Mr. Emmerich and his disaster team. On a more serious note, no amount of eye-popping special-effects can save this film from being anything more then environmental propaganda to warn of an event they themselves can not substantially prove.My Rating: * out of 5 (Grade: F+)",2,1,3,30 May 2004
Ocean's Twelve," The Moose Hole - Review of Ocean's Twelve
","After grossing nearly one-hundred and eighty-five million dollars domestically and well over four-hundred and fifty million dollars world-wide, Warner Brother executives were eager to jump on the bandwagon while the property was still hot and pump out a sequel as quickly, and cheaply, as possible. Steven Soderbergh insisted that the production budget be kept around the same as that of the original film  eight-five million dollars respectively  and asked all his actors, specifically George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Julia Roberts, to take significant pay cuts from their usual twenty-million dollar-per-picture salary. And with the WB studio in a tight market race, currently tied for second place with The Walt Disney Company, they need a hit more then ever, especially if they want to come close to recovering profits lost on the multi-million dollar disaster, Alexander. Perhaps the executives of the studio could learn a thing or two from these con-artists.The story picks up some time after the original film ended and takes audiences across such glamorous European locations as Amsterdam, Paris and Rome in another crime-capping adventure. It has been three years since Danny Ocean and the rest of the gang of thieves and con artists broke into the 'impenetrable' vault of Terry Benedict's Las Vegas casino and ripped a cool one-hundred and sixty million dollars right under his nose. After splitting the money amongst the eleven members of the Ocean's team, each went their separate ways, with the exception for Danny and Tess of course, and attempted to lie low and live an easy going life with their newly acquired fortune. Unfortunately for them, a fellow con-artist with a grudge against the group breaks Rule Number One by ratting them out to Terry Benedict, thus causing the ruthless casino owner to pay a visit to each and every one of the team members demanding a return of his one-hundred and ninety-eight million dollars  that's the amount of money they stole plus interest over three years  within two weeks. Considering they are too hot to find suitable work in the United States after their last stunt, they travel to Europe to steal an antique item only to run into complications with their criminal rival, 'The Night Fox', who just happened to be the man who broke Rule Number One. On top of that, the gang has to deal with Isabel Lahiri, an intrepid female Europol agent with extensive links with Rusty Ryan, who is vividly determined to catch them in the act. When it comes to the story treatment for Ocean's Twelve, one must learn not to take these sorts of genres, specifically the caper-comedy, seriously. They are for mere entertainment purposes only and not to be destined, or taken as such, for Oscar-caliber quality or serious thought. On another note, the script is not as original as it may seem. In fact, it was originally designed as John Woo action-flick vehicle but when it came to developing the highly-anticipated sequel to Ocean's Eleven, Warner Brothers decided to rewrite the script to specifically fit with each of the characters of the series. Though some may feel cheated by this piece of trivia, this turns out ten times better then anything John Woo could have slapped together, so look on the bright side of things here.The complication Ocean's Twelve faces, the exact same predicament the original feature ran into three years ago, is that with so many cast members, specifically ones with marquee names, increases the likelihood of each person receiving limited screen time which inevitably causes complaints of certain characters being underused. Quite surprisingly, the whole Brad Pitt/Catherine Zeta-Jones romance angle worked amazingly well and added yet another intriguing twist to the already complicated storyline. Unfortunately, what does not work out quite as well as it should have was the 'family' element to Catherine Zeta-Jones' Isabel Lahiri, if it can be properly described as such. There is hardly any mention of her family other then in limited moments of the film and the scene near the end where she reunites with her father seemed senselessly tacked onto the end without a second thought as to what it should have meant but was not. Perhaps it is due to all these separate story elements  the romance between Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones and the wager with 'The Night Fox'  that George Clooney's Danny Ocean seems quite left out of the picture compared to the last go-around where it was completely and entirely his film. Not that this was a significant problem but this is just yet another demonstration of the sometimes unequal shifting of story involvement amongst the numerous characters of the film series. Without giving too much information away, let us simply say that the way Tess is used in order to help the Ocean's gang pilfer a specific item from an Italian art museum was hilarious. Sure, it does wear a little thin as more time is spent on but, in the end, it works invariably. The only one that can truly be said as being underused in this picture is Andy Garcia reprising his role as the menacing Terry Benedict, the victim of Ocean's Eleven's casino heist from the first film. His appearance in the film, in the beginning and near the end, is really nothing more then a mere cameo, possibly to fulfill the contractual obligation he signed to appear in the sequel with the rest of the cast. This, on the other hand, can not be said of Matt Damon's Linus Caldwell who seems to have had a significant increase in the amount of screen time from the last film, playing a more central role in the story, specifically near the end.Overall, Ocean's Twelve, in spite of its failure to surpass the magnificence of the original which essentially set the precedent for all modern crime capers to follow, does indeed match it based on pure entertainment value and would certainly be a feature Frank Sinatra and the rest of the crooning Rat Pack would be proud of. All in all, the film itself has very few problems to raise complaint about  A drawback that was apparent with Ocean's Eleven as well was that the first thirty minutes of the picture start off quite laboriously and nothing exactly interesting happens or no real action occurs. Granted, this is to set up the situation and the characters but considering this is a sequel and most audience members are aware of the original film, this should not have taken as long as it did. And was it absolutely necessary to bring back every single member of the original Ocean's Eleven cast for this film? Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, and Carl Reiner barely appear at all  you could count on both hands, possibly only one, the number of lines each one of them has in this feature  and should have been written out entirely based on what they contribute  nothing. Middling complaints aside, Steven Soderbergh's skillful editing, mixing and cinematography style works wonders, except for the occasional still-picture shots, near the beginning and the end of the film, but are not so off-putting as to be entirely noticeable or discomforting. Though not holding quite the level of prestige as some notable sequels that have managed to surpass the expectations set upon by the first film might have, the series still able to maintain its suave composure, intricate white, and stylized flare to make more then worthwhile viewing over the holiday season this year.My Rating: **** out of 5 (Grade: B+)",8,2,5,11 December 2004
Elf," The Moose Hole - Review of Elf
","Christmas seems to be arriving earlier every year. Halloween and Thanksgiving are now the forgotten holidays as stores and businesses strum up garland and other holiday decorations in order to prepare for the hopefully fruitful shopping season ahead. The movie industry must be thinking the same thing starting this year especially after the success of last year's The Santa Clause 2, which opened the first weekend of November to nearly $30 million. New Line offers up their pre-holiday treat entitled Elf, which features the former Saturday Night Live comedian Will Ferrell, who has recently become a new rising star in Hollywood. After the dismal first half of the year with flops like A Man Apart and The Real Cancun, the studio bounced back in the second half with Freddy vs. Jason, Secondhand Lions, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and hopes to continue the trend until their mega-success The Return of the King opens near Christmas. Can Elf do that? If it's anything like The Santa Clause 2, it easily could but the Ferrell's comedy faces a lot more competition then Allen's did. Not only does the film open up against The Matrix Revolutions, the yuletide feature goes head to head with the highly publicized The Cat in the Hat and Disney's The Haunted Mansion later this month. Until then the film will have to build up pretty good word of mouth for it to still hear cash registers ringing come Christmas Day, let alone Thanksgiving.The story focuses a larger then usual elf who learns he is actually a human and travels to New York City to find his father. Up at the North Pole, elves are busy getting ready for Christmas but there is one elf that is learning that he doesn't quite fit in. Buddy is not the typical elf, his large size being the biggest factor. He eventually finds out from his adoptive father that he is actually a human that as an orphan baby climbed into Santa's gift bag one Christmas Eve and found his way to Santa's Workshop. After learning his true origin, Buddy travels to New York City to meet his father and be part of a real family. But this is easier said then done as his father is a real Scrooge and is prominently found on the naughty list. Buddy, who has never been to the human world, is unfamiliar with many of the things we are accustomed to like revolving doors and food products that don't include sugar. The unusually happy elf must find a way to change his father's workaholic attitude and help his new family find the true Christmas spirit. The story for Elf, though on the predictable side especially as the feature starts to wind down, works surprisingly well. This happens mostly in part to Ferrell's performance but there are also plenty of moments that come off as hilarious even without the lead starsThough the feature doesn't have an exceptionally large cast, the film doesn't have to with some lead characters picking up any slack left over by that. Will Ferrell, who was featured earlier this year in the hit comedy Old School, once again proves he has as much comedic timing and talent as he ever did on Saturday Night Live and probably even more so. Ferrell is able to make Buddy the elf both lovable and hilarious without pushing the personality of the character too far as to make him annoying and pathetic. James Caan, who takes on the role of Buddy's real father, has the grizzly workaholic business man down pat. The only problem lied not with Caan's performance but the character itself in how quickly the character changed his attitude at the end without really having a change-of-heart experience. And a big highlight came from the performance of legendary comedian Bob Newhart as Buddy's adoptive father. Newhart looks like he had a lot of fun with this role and gives a delightful performance that many will remember despite being only a supporting character rather then a lead.Overall, Elf joins the ranks of such holiday features as The Santa Clause and Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas that shows Hollywood is still able to make a yuletide classic as good as the old days. It's the wonderful atmosphere and Will Ferrell's exuberant performance that makes this film a delightful treat for the whole family can enjoy without one member of the family being alienated by certain material. There are relatively few complaints that can be made about comedy. The only one that is prominent in most minds would be that film tends to be bit predictable at the end of the feature but the filmmakers pull it off so well that many write it off and they should. The slightly-predictable ending shouldn't ruin the overall amusement and delightfulness that the rest of the film presented up to that point. Ferrell's over-the-top performance should be a decisive enough reason to venture to the local movie theater and see Elf but if you are not truly convinced, here may be a better reason: Elf will keep the children busy for an hour and a half while the parents do their Christmas shopping. Smart, huh?!My Rating: **** ½ out of 5 (Grade: A-)",9,0,1,14 December 2003
The Aviator," The Moose Hole - 'The Aviator' Soars!
","The story for The Aviator resurrects the aberrant life of Howard Hughes and presents it in the grandiose, nostalgic, and mythological style that only Martin Scorsese could have achieved so seamlessly and effectively all at the same time. In spite of its lavish three-hour time length, the film's flow and consistency is never once interrupted by abrupt slow periods, nor does it ever outpace its audience's ability to divulge information at a reasonable pace. Already at this point it is leaps and bounds ahead of the bumbling monstrosity that was Gangs of New York. And although the first few minutes of the picture in which Hughes' mother bathes the young boy in a tub of water in a dimly lit room and speaks to him of avoiding the disease-filled residence of a neighbor may seem a bit awkward when it first starts out, given time it will be made all the more understandable as eloquent symbolism to the sporadic nature of Howard Hughes.Howard Hughes, whether he be the man, the legend, or quite possibly a combination of the two, truly is the focus of this picture and Leonardo DiCaprio, having been snubbed in years past for his roles in both Titanic and Gangs of New York, captures brilliantly the eccentric aviator's maverick personality and from the very first scenes instantly grapples the attention of his audience in much the same way as Hughes would have wanted it done. Whether or not he receives a golden statuette this time around, let alone receives a nomination at the Academy Awards ceremony, DiCaprio, in the short years since his breakout performance in the smash-hit Titanic, has built up quite an impressive resume none-the-less, especially given that he has actually demonstrated true acting potential rather then simply riding the wave of pure publicity and hype. Cate Blanchett, an especially gifted actress who has rounded up in recent years particularly well-deserved acclaim from critics for her roles in The Lord of the Rings trilogy and Veronica Guerin, reflects perfectly the extraordinary, if not often curious, nature of the late-Katharine Hepburn. Alan Alda, famous for his portrayal of Hawkeye Pierce in the acclaimed television series M*A*S*H, proves that in all his years in the glitzy Hollywood business he has failed to lose his touch, giving a brilliantly stark performance as the conniving Senator Ralph Owen Brewster. In a particular scene in which the senator invites Howard to a luncheon meeting in a last ditch effort to avoid a public hearing and have him fold on the refutation of his new aviation bill, he appears as though he takes pleasure in tormenting Hughes' now apparent mental condition, going so far as to pick up a glass at the last minute and place a smudge mark on it directly in Hughes' line of sight. Splendidly Hughes, refusing to be baited and racking his bodily functions to fight back the affects of his mental condition, stuns Brewster by drinking straight out of that glass and forces him to be on the defensive, a position no one, let alone a senator of the United States Congress, finds comfortable. Surely not everything that Hughes did, most notably taking money from the government for projects he never completed or delivered and bribing military contractors, can be defined as just but he can not be blamed entirely for that given that those were the sign of the times. If anything, this investigation brought about a change in the way the aviation industry would be dealt with and Hughes' stern rebuttal of Brewster's true intentions single-handedly restored the idea of capitalism in yet another branch of the U.S. industrial system.Overall, The Aviator, in much the same light as its subject of discussion, is larger then life itself and for what seems once in a blue moon on the screen that does not go aggressively against it, ensuring its rightful place as the film to beat this awards season. The film ends rather abruptly with Hughes standing directly in front of a grungy bathroom mirror, repeating the phrase 'wave of the future', and should the audience feel angered or disappointed by this conclusion then Martin Scorsese will have successfully pulled off his desired effect. True to form, the life of Howard Hughes' was never the same again from that moment on. For the mythic man who had done so much in his lifetime up to that point and at the same time had far more yet to accomplish, Hughes' condition spiraled out of control, reducing him to live in total obscurity in one of his several casinos in Las Vegas, dying of kidney failure. That, ladies and gentlemen, is truly the disheartening conclusion to the eccentric, yet majestic, life of Mr. Howard Hughes. The man who perhaps was greatly overshadowed by the legendary figure he helped create and whose shoes he could not fill. Scorsese, a man always willing to be daring and take a risk when it comes to the exact look and feel of a particular film, brilliantly  how many times can that be said of him  captures in each year that is represented the accurate visual style of the color film of that time period, whether it was the old-fashioned Cinecolor or the two-strip Technicolor film. And as the story progresses, the film's appearance matures and fills out more, giving The Aviator a visual quality all its own, setting its miles apart from the competition. Undoubtedly this film will not be everyone's cup of tea, as disappointing as that may be to hear given as how apparently masterful it is, but rest assured that given the proper number of viewings and a through understanding of the life and time of the man who was Howard Hughes, it will be easy for anyone to see as to why this will be the film that gives Scorsese his absurdly overdue Academy Award this year.",9,1,3,16 January 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," The Moose Hole - Review of The Matrix Revolutions
","`Everything that has a beginning  Has an end. I see the end coming  I see the darkness spreading  I see death  And you are all that stands in his way.'And all that is standing in your way of the most highly anticipated film in years is the massive swarm of people ahead of you. Who would have thought a relatively small film called The Matrix in 1999 would eventually spawn one of the greatest film series in movie history? When the original film grossed $171 million at the domestic box office and became a huge cult favorite on DVD, Warner Brothers quickly jumped at the opportunity to role the (supposedly) final two sequels. It took the Wachowski brothers nearly four years and $300 million but the journey is almost over. There are many questions to ask before seeing Revolutions that one must ask himself: How will it end? Will I understand it? Will everything be answered? Can this truly be the final Matrix film? But the most important question to ask may be the most irrelevant: Do we really want it to end? Surely the Warner Brothers executives know their answer.The story centers once again on the journey of The One (Neo) as he tries to end the war between man and machine after years of conflict. Revolutions picks up exactly where Reloaded left off earlier this year but here is a recap: Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus lead the human resistance against the machine world for control of the world. For years, the machines have kept human kind plugged into The Matrix, a simulated dream world, and threatened to destroy the last human city known as Zion. Morpheus believes that their journey is almost at an end but there are some that stand in the way of providence. Namely Agent Smith, who was once destroyed by Neo but now has come back to destroy him and everything else. In the final scene of the film, both Neo and Smith (in human form) have been knocked unconscious just as the machines prepare to invade Zion.Got it? If you don't then too bad because here we go. Without giving too much away, let's just say everything seems to come full circle. As the humans within Zion prepare to duke it out for control of the world against the machines, Neo goes to the machine city to work out a compromise and stop Smith before it is too late for both man and machine. Did you get confused during Reloaded and hate it for that? Then you're not going to like Revolutions. There is a lot to divulge within the course of the two hour feature and Revolutions will require multiple viewings to unlock all the secrets of The Matrix franchise. Outside of the confusing interlocking concepts, does Revolutions deliver a good plot? Though the beginning starts off a little too slow, the rest of the film smoothes out any rough edges and ends the series with a bang.Most of the cast (outside of a relative few additional members) is the same as it was with The Matrix Reloaded. But in Revolutions, some perform better then others. Keanu Reeves delivers the goods with his role as The One (Neo). Reeves may seem relatively stiff in the film but that is the point. As Smith becomes more and more human, so Neo becomes more and more machine like and acts that way. Reeves does a fabulous job in dragging that point out though many will probably not pick up on that fact. Carrie-Ann Moss takes on the role of Trinity for the final time but isn't as featured as she was in Reloaded, which is both good and bad. The good? The focus of Revolutions is suppose to be on Neo and that is the point. The bad? She has some scenes but not the way many will want her to go out on. The biggest highlight of Revolutions is not the special effects (though they come in a close second) but rather is the performance of Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith. Weaving is so over the top with this role that it is just absolutely amazing to watch especially in the final battle sequence between Smith and Neo in the rain. So what is bad? Monica Belluci's Persephone has no point in this film, let alone the entire Matrix series. What does her character do that is of any real importance? Nothing other then bring them the Keymaker in Reloaded but still, what is her purpose? And the biggest disappointment comes from the lack of Morpheus. He is barely shown in the film and deserved more screen time then he got.Overall, Revolutions may not end the franchise in the way everybody would want but the final confrontation between Smith and Neo at the end is worth the price of admission alone. Does the final film answer all the questions? Thankfully, No. Would anybody really be satisfied if all the answers were given to them on a silver platter with no thought put into divulging the film series' secrets for themselves? No. Will multiple viewing be required to fully understand it? Yes but if you don't feel like paying the price of admission then you will only have to wait till at least May for the DVD. Many will leave the theater disappointed and, in certain aspects, they should. Granted, you had to expect that the film would not end with a picture perfect happy ending like you would want but the ending that is given just doesn't serve the film justice. Some fans will feel cheated, some will feel empty, while others will be too blown away from the battle sequences to fully comprehend or care about the real ending. The final scene of the film is one of those either you love or hate kind of things with no area in between. Bottom line is that Revolutions performs better then Reloaded but doesn't end the franchise the way it should have. How will you feel? That is up to you but like the Oracle says in the film, `We can't see past the choices we don't understand'. So grasp the concept of the film before making your final evaluation.My Rating: **** ½ out of 5 (Grade: A)",9,0,0,5 November 2003
The Village," The Moose Hole - Review of The Village
","For those wanting to know not of the film's secrets, This review must not be seen Never enter the review, That is where the spoilers wait These are the rules of watcher of the woods Heed this warning now, For they are coming In the last couple of years, the supernatural thriller genre has belonged mainly to one man: writer/director M. Night Shyamalan. Though several have tried to copy his style of film-making and the signature twist endings, few have developed the same kind of success that he currently enjoys, whether it be the numbers at the box office or the fan base his films have built up. Ever since 1999's surprise hit, The Sixth Sense, M. Night Shyamalan has been scaring movie-goers across the world with his takes on ghosts, superheroes and aliens but after several years it seems he may be giving the old gig a break. The latest rumblings from Hollywood saying that The Village may be the last thriller in awhile as his next project is set to be the film adaptation of the hit novel, The Life of Pi. Preferably he would like to go out on top with the genre he made his own playground but that is all up to how the American public receive it, either as another success or a failure.The story centers on an isolated group of villagers who find themselves confined to their town by the mysterious creatures that roam the woods that encircle them. In the year 1897, the village of Covington, Pennsylvania can be seen as the prime example of a utopian society  there is no violence, no greed, and all work together in upholding the vision of hope that has driven the villagers to bountiful blessings, something the elders of the town believe will continue through the leadership of their children. Covington, to the untrained eye, may seem perfect but the element of fear still dwells within the occupants of the town. What would inhabitants of a utopian society such as this have to fear? 'Those we do not speak of'  red hooded creatures that reside in the woods and make raids on the town when they feel they have been threatened. None have the courage to venture beyond the forbidden border, except Lucius Hunt, the head strong yet reserved son of Alice Hunt, one of the town elders. Lucius feels compelled to defy the boundaries of the village but at the same time he dares not leave out of the fear, the only one he has, that harm will come to Ivy Walker, the blind daughter of the leading town elder with whom he has fallen deeply in love with. But when an accident occurs in the village and Lucius is found deeply hurt, Ivy demands that she be given permission to enter the woods and obtain medicine from the nearby towns.The story for The Village suffers from an acute identity crisis in that it plays out more like an extended episode of The Twilight Zone then usual Shyamalan thriller audiences have come associate his films with. That is not to say that it doesn't try, in fact the first half is quite engaging, it's just that it fails to ends the same way. Another Shyamalan thriller, The Sixth Sense, shares a similar trait with this film, the less then surprising twist at the end. If The Village was able to have as genuine and masterfully orchestrated a plot as The Sixth Sense had then it wouldn't be a problem. Unfortunately, Shyamalan demonstrates that either he is losing his once golden touch or he is running low on decent material to scare audiences with.With as talented a group of performers as is seen in The Village, the most high-profile cast ever assembled by director M. Night Shyamalan, you would think it would no problem for a film with the least orchestrated storyline to be raised to the level of a tolerable feature but that isn't true here. Bryce Dallas Howard, the daughter of director Ron Howard, makes a surprisingly brilliant debut in the role of Ivy Walker, the blind daughter of leading town elder. All Shyamalan films contain a lead role that tests even the most skilled of actors and Howard is able to tackle the role easily without showing once any inability to rise to the challenge, which indicates she could be a rising star in Hollywood if she continues to give prime performances such as this. Joaquin Phoenix, in the role of Lucius Hunt, demonstrates that he can lead a film with an engaging and emotionally driven performance that goes way beyond the role given to him in Signs. And Adrien Brody gives an emotionally charged roller coaster performance as the mentally challenged Noah. There are times where he can make you laugh, make cry, have you feel sorry for him only to turn around and do something that provokes the opposite effect with the audience. The character of Noah is the combination of both the talent of Brody and dexterous construction from Shymalan's script. The problem with the cast is that there are too many of them for the audience to keep track of each individual character plot. The brilliance about Shyamalan's past films was that he kept the group of characters relatively small in order to allow the audience to singularly focus on the actions of the main characters and not have them confused by separate character developments. The filmmaker diverts from his usually agenda and that in effect hurts the film's script deeply.Overall, writer/director M. Night Shyamalan trades in his philanthropic messages on humanity and supernatural fantasies brought to life for cheap scares and a story that may turn out to be an accidental rip off of a classic sci-fi television series. Though Shyamalan makes no direct assertions within the nearly two hour feature and quite possibly leaves this up to interpretation, there is the slight assumption that The Village may be a political commentary on the current climate of the United States after September 11th.What evidence within the framework of the film would support this theory? For starters, the color coded system the villagers develop, yellow to indicate safety and red to imply fear and danger, overtly resembles the terrorism warning levels developed by Homeland Security after the attacks on September 11th. The creatures that wander the woods and raid the town when threatened are nothing more then false reports developed by the elders to keep the townspeople in fear and prevent them from leaving the village, which may be a reference to the accusations made by the liberals about the Bush administration whenever they release a terror alert. And the most convenient piece of evidence lies in the name of the lead elder who orchestrates the entire façade: Walker, which may or may not be an allusion to the current commander in chief's middle name. Granted the deception was in an effort to preserve innocence but in the minds of some individuals, deception is deception no matter the reason.Even if that theory is proven correct, only a hand full of individuals will probably pick up on that message and doesn't affect a person's perception of the film much if one disagrees with the assertion that may or may not be made. In other aspects of the film, James Newton Howard is once again able to calibrate a successful and chilling musical score that works directly in sync with the actions on screen, as he has been able to do in all of Shyamalan's films in the past. And even though Shyamalan's engaging sense of direction allows the psychological intensity of the film to remain intact through nearly the entire presentation, the less then surprising outcomes makes it out to be all for naught. There are three twist endings to the film: the first seems misplaced as it totally eliminates the element of fear that is associated with the creatures, the second isn't so much a problem as it is obvious especially if you're one who pays close attention to certain characters, and the final twist gives you the feeling as though you were watching an episode of The Twilight Zone, leaving the audience neither shocked nor amazed, just swindled. But the film's most disappointing aspect is the fact that the audience is left at the end with nothing; no fear, no hope. The Village is the first Shyamalan thriller that eliminates the sense of fear movie-goers would take home with them when it reveals the creatures weren't real. This was the key that made Shymalan thrillers classics to so many people. Whether it is political allegory or just pure coincidence, anyway you slice it The Village is a drawn out disappointment.",7,0,0,31 July 2004
Cold Mountain," The Moose Hole - Review of Cold Mountain
","What is with Hollywood and the concept of love in the mitts of great disasters? There can be no greater example of this obsession than the highest grossing film of all time, Titanic. Though the Oscar darling can be blamed for the most recent trend, it is not the first to start this. There's the classic Casablanca and many other films set in and around World War II that do the same thing that is happening today in war features. Many films have come out recently and tried to duplicate the same result as Titanic but none have come close. Miramax is hoping they can break that statement with their film set in North Carolina during the Civil War. The Great War that divided this nation from 1861 to 1865 has become a hot subject as of late but few have taken the time to really focus, accurately at least, what this war was truly about. Instead they focus on side issues and stories that were only a small piece of the puzzle that was this time period. Gangs of New York, which starred Leonardo DiCaprio, is a perfect example of this. If the subject matter of Cold Mountain and the historical time period are blended in a way that creates an accurate interesting tale then maybe more and more films will be able to do the same.The story follows the young Confederate soldier who has deserted his position in the army in order to return home to be with his pre-war sweetheart. Inman is a man of very little words and actions but when he discovers the new missionary's daughter, Ada, he is at even greater loss for words. The two young North Carolina residents seem to take an interest in each other but that development is quickly put in jeopardy as Inman goes to join the other young men of the South to defend their homeland from `Northern aggression'. After he is wounded after the Siege of Petersburg, he deserts the Confederate army and starts a long and tiresome journey back to Cold Mountain. Along the way, he encounters many different characters that both help and hinder his journey home. Back in Cold Mountain, things are no better for Ada for the farm goes into disarray after the death of her father. With help of a drifter named Ruby, she hopes to survive long enough to reunite with Inman once again. The story for Cold Mountain may have been a bestselling plot when it was in book form but up on screen it is nothing short of disappointing. The plot is pretty predictable with several actions leading up to `major' events that could be seen from a mile away. The feature runs into the same problems as Gangs of New York, which opened this same time last year, in that it tries to cram too much into three hours and loses its focus not too far from the end.Though the cast seems to be an impressive group of Oscar favorites, few of them really show off why they should be labeled as such in this film. The biggest problem has to be Nicole Kidman's character, Ada. In the beginning of the film, it seems as though her character should be a little younger then Kidman herself makes her out to be. How old is Kidman? Forty years old? Whatever age she is, the way the character is presented, it seems she should be a lot younger. Another problem is featured after the death of Ada's father. Obviously Ada is going through rough times taking care of herself and the farm all alone but her faces just holds up so well. Boy! The medical care back in the 1860's may have been crap but make-up was just spectacular. This sarcasm being said, they could have made her character a little less dolled up, cosmetic-wise, as the film progressed. Despite a somewhat impressive performance by Jude Law, the bottom line is that the so-called relationship between Inman and Ada lack substance. They barely know each other and yet the audience is made to believe that they act as if they have known each other all their lives and once the war is over, they can go back to where they started? And critics should especially be yelled at believing this after ranting on such films as Daredevil and Pearl Harbor for attempting the same thing Cold Mountain tries to pull off. If there is anything good about the cast, it has to be Renee Zellweger's Ruby, who really picks up the film where it seems to be heading for a continuous decline.Overall, Cold Mountain manages to outdo last year's Gangs of New York but like the English Patient, it takes the film a long time to get to its predictable and pointless conclusion. Once again the Union on the basis of the Civil War are demonized and made to look like idiots no more so then in sequences like the scene that involved Natalie Portman's unnecessary character. Even the issue of freeing the slaves, which was not the main issue of the Civil War though many try to make it that way,  isn't as focused on correctly as they could have made it. What would have been a lot more interesting then the bland `love story' would have been the more grand battle sequences and issues of statehood and homeland but those are only battered about here and there without developing into anything grand scale. The film presents a valid topic of the Confederacy wanting to start a war and even doing anything they could to fight the North but when it comes to the end of the war, they blame everybody but themselves for what has been brought upon them. Director Minghella could have done something like that but chose not to. Once again another lackluster Civil War feature is presented to the movie-going public. Hopefully the American education system can pick up where this film fails to lead up to.My Rating: *** out of 5 (Grade: C)",6,0,0,3 January 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," The Moose Hole - Terminator Rises Again
","Let's say you're an average Joe. You have your favorite sports car, a fabulous job, your own house, a beautiful wife and a great family. You go through life without a care in the world. But these things won't last. Why? Judgment Day. Imagine a world of complete darkness where man's destiny is controlled by machines and super computers. Sound familiar? It should because this is the backdrop of the entire Terminator series. The original Terminator cost an estimated $7 million but went on to gross $40 million at the box office. It became so popular on video that Terminator 2: Judgment Day was created, helmed by James Cameron. With a production budget of $100 million, T2 went on to gross $204 million, so it was a no brainer to make another sequel, right? Well, it took them 12 years and a reported $175 million budget but T3 has finally arrived in theaters just in time for the 4th of July holiday. But will Rise of the Machines continue the success of the popular franchise or will this result in its fall?The story goes that the life of John Connor, the leader of the resistance movement that defeats the machines, is in danger once again. But this time he is not the only target. A T-X Terminator, the most advanced killing machine created by the Skynet network, has been sent to the year 2001 to kill the lieutenants of the future human resistance as well as John Connor himself. But John will be harder to locate because he has been living off the grid for nearly ten years. By having no cell phone, no home, and no real identity, the Skynet network is less able to track him down should the time come. Though he and his mother, Sarah Connor, prevented Judgment Day from occurring on August 29th, 1997 when they prevented the creation of the network, he still lives in fear that the end of the world still may come. He fears are correct as the T-X is looking for him but a T-850, like the one sent to kill him before he was born, has been sent by the resistance movement to ensure his survival. The events that occurred in T2: Judgment Day didn't prevent Judgment Day, it just delayed it. Within three hours, nearly 3 billion human lives will be destroyed in an instant. Now John Connor must team up with the Terminator and his future wife to try and prevent Judgment Day once again. The story for T3 is not as fabulous as the one done for T2 but with James Cameron not directing this time around, did anybody really expect it to be? Having the opening of the film focus on the thoughts of John Connor and then flash forward to a battle between machines and man was a good way to start off the picture. There are a couple of holes in the plot of the film that could have explained why certain things happen within the film but they really aren't a huge matter for the film. The ending to the film was also well done but more could have been shown.The only returning cast member from Terminator 2 is Arnold Schwarzenegger reprising his role as the T-850 Terminator that he made famous nearly twenty years ago. Once again Arnold works extremely well with this role. Though more of the character was done using CGI then in the other previous films, Schwarzenegger still provides an emotional voice to the character in those types of situations. Edward Furlong, who played young John Connor in T2, was dropped from the project when the studio believed that his drug and alcohol problems would delay production, so Nick Stahl was brought in to replace him in the role. Stahl is the not the perfect replacement but still does a very good job with the character. Kristanna Loken is the new villain in the Terminator franchise playing the role of the T-X Terminator, Skynet's most sophisticated killing machine. She is very plain with her emotion which is good since she plays a machine. The only problem with her character is the questions left unanswered. Her character is made of liquid metal but at one point during the film a part of her is damaged prevent the use of a primary weapon but the film doesn't explain why this happens. But that really has more to do with the plot then with her. Claire Danes rounds out the rest of the main cast as the future wife of John Connor. There weren't that many scenes with in the course of the film that really focus on her, which is good since John is more of the focus, but most of the scenes that she was involved in were well done. The introduction of her character and the whole idea of destiny (her and John meeting and eventually getting married) was a good twist to the story.Overall, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a good summer popcorn film. T3 doesn't even come close to the majesty of T2 and for several reasons. The dialogue is much less serious then T2 but this was to be expected with James Cameron not at the helm this time around. The plot holes presented in the film also hurt the overall effect. There is no clear explanation on what Skynet is exactly and how it is able to control the machines if there is no core. There are also unanswered questions involving how John Connor and the Terminator are able to enter a secret military area with no problems at all. This doesn't seem to really matter as all Hell breaks loose soon after. The film is also less dramatic then the first sequel and plays more for just action and laughs but that seems to work on its own level. There were many humorous moments in the film with some working like the statements made by the T-850 replying to situations that machines can't understand. But there were also moments that didn't work. For example, the T-X inflates her breasts to get the attention of a cop who pulls her over. This was unnecessary as the cop didn't even seem to notice. Besides some minor complaints, there are many things that work for the film. The fact that Jonathan Mostow makes this his own film instead of just trying to copy what James Cameron did in T2 is fabulous. The action sequences were well done and the special effects were just absolutely amazing especially at the very end of the film. Speaking of the ending, it was a little disappointing that the film makers ended the film the way they did but that allows them to follow up with a fourth Terminator film and not give away too much. T3 may not be the best film out there but it is still a great film to enjoy over the holiday weekend.My Rating: **** out of 5 (Grade: B+)",8,0,0,4 July 2003
"I, Robot"," The Moose Hole - Review of I, Robot
","What happened to the Big Willie America first fell in love with many summers ago? The former rapper and Fresh Prince of Bel-Air became the king of the sci-fi action genre with two back-to-back box office hits, Independence Day and Men In Black, after first making an image for himself on the big screen in Bad Boys, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. So what happened? Wild, Wild West, an unmitigated embarrassment for all those involved, went on to be one of the biggest box office flops of 1999 and forced Smith to concentrate on more low key roles in films like Ali and The Legend of Bagger Vance until the fallout from the disaster flick had passed over. Will Smith re-emerged on the summer scene with Men In Black II in 2002 and Bad Boys II in 2003, and though they weren't as critically, or even publicly, hailed as much as his earlier works, he proved once again that he was a box office draw when it came to a film's opening weekend, which is all that seems to matter now adays with fewer leggy films popping up at the box office.The story centers on one paranoid cop sent to investigate the first recorded murder committed by a robot. In the year 2035, the future of humanity is as bright and efficient as ever imagined. During this time, robots, once thought improbable several years ago, are now an every day commodity. In fact, the largest robotics distribution company in the world, USR, is set to launch its most highly advanced robot to date, the NS-5, to nearly every home in America. The shipment is so large that experts claim that there will be one robot for every five humans. To optimists this seems like a marvelous dream come true but to others, namely Detective Del Spooner, this is nothing short of a nightmare. After a freak accident several years earlier that left him haunted with images of the terrible event every night when he goes to bed, Detective Spooner has grown paranoid with the idea of humanity becoming too dependent on robots. One day, he is sent to investigate the 'apparent' suicide of Dr. Miles Hogenmiller, the man who created the Three Laws of Robotics and worked extensively with the NS-5 robots at the USR headquarters. Spooner dismisses the idea that Hogenmiller would kill himself and implicates a robot named Sonny who was found hiding in Hogenmiller's office and fled when the detective tried to question him. Everyone believes Detective Spooner has lost his mind for a robot can not bring harm to a human being since that would be a direct violation of the first Law of Robotics. If this were a violation of that law then there would be nothing to prevent the robots from turning against humanity and taking control of the world. Unfortunately, after a series of complicated events involving the NS-5 robots, Detective Spooner becomes more and more convinced that his once thought overwhelming paranoia may be the truth. The story for I, Robot, which was based on the 'I, Robot' anthology written by Isaac Asimov, is nothing more then the regurgitation of every other science fiction film with the concept of robots taking control of the world and destroying humanity. The difference with I, Robot is that the filmmakers lace the script with so much pretentious humor that most of it comes off flat and ultimately distracting from the film's supposed serious concept.One of the biggest compliments attributed to I, Robot is its concept of a relatively small cast, allowing the focus of the audience to center on the its main characters rather then distracting them with numerous side-characters that do nothing but clog up an already complex storyline. But that's where the kudos stop with several of those characters coming off as flawed or seriously misguided by the script. Will Smith, once again in his summer block-buster mode, gives an engaging performance as Detective Del Spooner, despite the character's noticeable flaws. Whether it's due to the way the script was written or the way Smith portrays the character, Spooner's wise-cracks are too over-the-top, with most of them, namely the one's early on in the film, failing to be the least bit humorous. Once you are able to look past that, Smith manages to the make the character quite interesting and mysterious with his emotions playing a prominent factor in his unpredictability. Alan Tudyk, who provided the voice work for the robot Sonny, does an adequate job with the limited material given to him but can't raise the character above anything more then a cheap CGI distraction. The problem with the character of Sonny is that the filmmakers attempt what director Steven Spielberg failed to do with Haley Joel Osment's character in A.I.: Artificial Intelligence, which was to present a robot that had dreams, felt emotions, and, in some weird way, possessed a soul. The reason this failed, and this stands true with I, Robot's attempt as well, is that when all is said and done, a robot is nothing more then highly advanced can-opener. You can build it up as much as you want, throw in some high-tech gizmos, and anything else you can think of but you won't be able to replicate anything remotely close to a human being with a soul. A soul is what makes humans unique above any other creature and nothing, not even by the hands of man, can duplicate that and place it inside something else, let alone a hunk of metal. And what was the point of Shia Le Beouf's character in this film other then being a pathetic attempt at comic-relief, something this film possesses too much of.Overall, as hard as I, Robot attempts to come off as brilliant vision of a futuristic utopia where all humanity has to do is look into the inner depths of our souls to live in peace and harmony, it comes off more along the lines of scientific mumbo-jumbo and computer-animated special effects run amok thrown into a blender at top speed resulting in nothing more then a garbled mess. Whether or not the film accurately projects the writings of Isaac Asimov, Robot's radical theories and story elements will go over most heads and those that do understand them will be disappointed by the lack of depth into how these conclusions were made. The special effects, though marveling at times, seem to be more the focus of the filmmakers then the script as nearly every scene seems to put more detail and concentration on the computer animation then how the story shapes out in the end. How can a film that seems as bad as this get any worse? By finishing it off with a final sequence that feels like the screen writers themselves didn't even know how to end this disaster. The filmmakers would have been better off just ending the film with Detective Spooner and Dr. Susan Calvin on top of the USR building looking out upon a rising sunset. Sound clichéd, doesn't it? Sure it does, but a clichéd ending, or any ending really, would have been a whole lot better then the perplexing sequence the  You can't even call it a ending since the scene resolves nothing and just leaves the audience with more questions with no idea on how to answer them. Are we to assume there will be a sequel to answer them? What if the film bombs? What if there is no sequel? Then what? I, Robot may have seemed like a neat summer distraction, quite possibly even thought provoking, from the juiced up trailers and television spots but advertisements can be deceiving and they are no different with this film. If you aren't a fan of Will Smith or special effects outweighing the plot, save your money and rent either The Matrix or Terminator 2: Judgment Day  It's practically the same thing only ten times better from everything this film presents.My Rating: ** ½ out of 5 (Grade: D+)",4,0,0,16 July 2004
The Alamo," The Moose Hole - Review of The Alamo
","`Remember the Alamo!'Sean Hannity, in his latest book `Deliver Us From Evil', said it best that, `Many of America's greatest moments have come when its people have taken up arms to defend liberty'. This statement can be applied to many memorable moments in American history ranging from the fight for independence in the American Revolution, the struggle for unity in the Civil War, and the rescuing of foreigners from brutal regimes in World War II, the War in Afghanistan, and Operation Iraqi Freedom. And, yes, even at The Alamo, which is the topic of the above mentioned movie and this review. Due to events both at the time shortly after the fall of The Alamo and in the decades there after, the story of `The Last Stand' has been greatly misconstrued, with no help from the filmmakers in Hollywood who, then as they often do now, take `creative liberties' to make history more exciting and action packed then to express the true meanings of such memorable events. There is no doubt that many will be going into this film expecting admirable heroes, consistent gun-blazing action, and everything spelled out for them so that no actual thinking is required  For those expecting that, I am proud to say you will be deeply disappointed.The story centers on a small group of settlers who barricade themselves within a former missionary church and do battle with a vast superior Mexican army, all in the name liberty from a vicious dictator. The tale of `The Alamo' really begins around the mid-1830s in a time when the Mexicans have won independence from Spain but their government has slipped from an unstable democracy into a militaristic dictatorship led by Generalissimo Antonio Miguel Lopez de Santa Anna. In those uncertain times, the Mexicans allowed travelers from the United States to settle in their lands and even encouraged it in order to bring the American dollar into their economy. By 1836, the number of Americans greatly outnumbered the Mexicans 4-to-1. Under the rule of Santa Anna, who would become known as the `Napoleon of the West', further restrictions were being passed on the settlers and consistent negotiations for an annexation of Texas to become a separate nation from both Mexico and the United States were continuously denied. Faced with an uncertain future for settlement and a fervent refusal to obey a totalitarian dictator, 300 men (along with their wives and children) fortify themselves within The Alamo, which was a former missionary church (one left uncompleted), faced against over a thousand Mexican soldiers led by Santa Anna who is determined to crush the colonial resistance no matter how many of his men he has to sacrifice to complete that task. The story for The Alamo is quite possibly one of the most historically accurate features in quite some time and definitely the most historical representation of the event presented on film, which isn't saying too much with the highly inaccurate John Wayne feature being the most popular one. Those who have a general understanding of the events leading up The Alamo as well as the central figures within the film will have a fare greater appreciation for the work done here then those coming in cut and dry.Before discussing the group of talented actors who represent the central figures who stood and fought at The Alamo, one must know that the men represented in this film, in the event known as `The Last Stand', are not admirable men based on their pasts. Some are drunks, some are abandoners, and others are men chasing the shadows of what many expect them to be. But all that, as bad and undesirable as their situations may have been, does not matter in their courageous stand taken at The Alamo, where all fought and died for a cause they believed in and because of that nothing else can have hear-say. One of the most memorable highlights of the film, if not the greatest highlight, had to be the exuberant and well-fitted performance of Billy Bob Thornton as Davy Crockett. Thornton gives a brilliant insight into a man who's own legend, which was often too much for him to bare, brought him to the Alamo and how he eventually found true meaning in his life because of it, though he had no true reason to be there in the first place. General Sam Houston, who was originally planned to be portrayed by Russell Crowe, is performed by Dennis Quaid who gives an admirable performance as well as the right tone of the character despite a couple of unadmirable qualities that plagued his place in history. And praise must be given to the casting director for picking an actual Mexican in the role of Santa Anna (wonderfully acted out by Emilio Echevarria) unlike Once Upon a Time in Mexico's choice of William Dafoe as a Mexican drug cartel which was clearly miscast.Overall, Remember The Alamo for what it was  the courageous last stand of a group of individuals who saw Texas as a fresh new start away from the dishonorable lives they once lived and free from the oppressive rule of a totalitarian regime. As it was said once before, The Alamo is not for the average movie-goer who every-so-often finds an interest in a historical based drama. This one requires a much keener interest in the subject matter as well as a general knowledge of the events that led up to the event as well as ones that followed in its wake. Though the filmmakers try their best to keep the focus of the film in its historical context, occasionally they veer off course and slip into its mythological aspects, most notably the final scenes of Jim Bowie and Davy Crockett, which, as aspirating as they may be, took away from the film's nearly flawless portrayal. Another minor complaint would be that the filmmakers did not focus too much on the events after the fall of The Alamo and the defeat of Santa Anna but with running time standing at slightly over two hours, one can see why they may have wanted to wrap it up at the point they did. The Alamo no doubt will have its critical, as well as public, hecklers but their criticism is reserved to the less knowledgeable area of their field that focuses only on what is on the surface and doesn't require supplemental insight into historical events.",8,7,10,9 April 2004
Van Helsing," The Moose Hole - Review of Van Helsing
","Another summer season has come upon us at the box office with many major releases opening within its first few weeks all in an effort to gather as much coinage as they possibly can before Spider-Man 2 steamrolls its way into theaters. Anything after that film better be pretty damn good to compete with it but that is another topic for another day. Prior to 1999 the summer season kicked off around Memorial Day weekend as children began to slowly be released from schools across the country but that was before The Mummy opened to $43 million the weekend of May 7th, 1999, which, in effect, changed the way studios dealt with the summer heat. In the two years that followed, both Gladiator (2000) and The Mummy Returns (2001) opened on the first weekend of May to fantastic numbers but that never became the official kick-off point for the summer until Spider-Man sealed the deal in 2002, opening to $115 million its opening weekend. Universal studios doesn't expect that much with the opening of Van Helsing but they do expect a decent return as it is not often that they shell out $160 million (and then some) for one film especially in the current situation they are in with their new parent company. But considering Stephen Sommers, the same man who directed The Mummy and its sequel, is at that reins, there's a sure bet the cult followers will be out in droves once again.The story follows the adventures a man sent by a secret society to go out into the world to vanquish evil creatures such as the Wolfman, Frankenstein's monster, and Dracula and stop their reins of terror on humanity. Van Helsing is known throughout most of Europe, either as a holy man or as a murderer, but the man behind God's work has no memory of who he is or where he comes from. All he knows is that he is in the service of the Catholic Church sent to different parts of the world to stop evil in the form of monsters and demons. There's nothing in the job description about being well liked by the people he is trying to protect. His latest assignment is to travel to Transylvania to destroy the powerful Count Dracula while at the same time protect Anna Valerious, the last of her family's lineage who had sworn to do anything in their power to destroy Dracula and end his rein of terror. But Dracula has a plan of his own  he devises a course of action in using Frankenstein's monster as well as the Wolfman in his efforts to raise up a force of bat-like children to rule over humanity with fear and terror. There's only one man who stands in his way, who has the force of God on his side: Van Helsing. The story for Van Helsing is hard to really grasp but not in the sense you would think. The film isn't a real puzzler or anything of that nature (Good vs. Evil  not much to figure out here) but one does have to have a tolerance for campy action flicks or else this will be a complete waste of time. Though the film is clichéd at moments, surprisingly it wasn't so much as was to be expected, if that helps at all to those who disliked The Mummy films.No one may actually be going into this film for the sole purpose of seeing any particular star within it, which is probably the reason why there are only two (one if you want to get into specifics) big names in the cast, but none the less the cast of Van Helsing offers some decent performances, nothing Oscar caliber by any means, while at the same presenting several prominent disappointments. Hugh Jackman, who is best known for his performance of Wolverine in the X-Men film series, gives an engaging performance as Abraham Van Helsing, though no where near the one given by Sir Anthony Hopkins in Bram Stoker's Dracula, which was to be expected. The only problem lies with the character itself as the script starts off with many questions and yet answers very few of the them by the end, which could or could not point to a possible sequel in the works. Kate Beckinsale, who hasn't been able to make a name for her self in the sense of truly carrying a film on her name alone just yet, works with what is given to her as best she can but there really isn't much emotional attachment with the character to be really all that concerned for what happens to her within the course of the film. Though it was Sommer's intent on resurrecting (in a sense) interest in Dracula, the vision seems to be lost with Richard Roxburgh's go around as he is way too over-the-top in a way that's laughable at times and, at times, confusing. The same would have to go for Dracula's Brides played Elena Anaya, Silvia Colloca and Josie Maran, who become so irritating in their performances that the audience will be applauding at their demises, and not for the reasons they should be doing so.Overall, Van Helsing kicks off the 2004 summer box office with more of a whimper then a driving force and only shatters the hopes of those who were awaiting an enthusiastic kick-off as had always been accustomed in the past. As with Hellboy, Van Helsing falls into the category of films that doesn't leave you clamoring to see it again nor is it a feature that you would detest repeating, if it were presented to you again. The first third of the film (dividing the film into three parts) was quite exciting, mysterious, and filled with wall-to-wall action, which makes the other two thirds of the film all the more disappointing. There is nothing as bad as a film that sets you up for quality entertainment only to knock you down with a weak follow-through. The problem lies with the script itself which becomes too bogged down with numerous plot lines and character aspects and quickly deteriorates into a mundane and repetitive camp film. There's nothing wrong with camp films as long as they are done right, which isn't the case with Van Helsing. Another issue that was clearly prominent throughout the film was the blatant over-use of CGI effects, which often looked fake, no more so then in the scene where the Wolfman jumps across the fire on the wagon toward Van Helsing or the transformation of Dracula, which just looked ridiculous. And there was a small problem the musical score, which, every so often, sounded too familiar to the score for The Mummy, but nothing major to complain about. There are three types of people who will be disappointed by this film: fans of the classic novel (and film) Dracula, those who fell for the hype, and all others who aren't just entertained by a few mere explosions and boobs flashed on the screen. Van Helsing will surely go down as one of the bigger disappointments of the summer season.My Rating: *** ½ out of 5 (Grade: C+)",7,0,0,7 May 2004
Collateral," The Moose Hole - Review of Collateral
","`O' Oscar, Where Art Thou?' is a phrase that Hollywood super-star Tom Cruise has become all too familiar with, especially as of late. Ever since his break out in Risky Business, a film, as good as it may be, is hardly Oscar material, Cruise has made numerous attempts to take home the golden statuette by taking on roles in such high-profile dramas as Born on the Fourth of July, A Few Good Men, Jerry Maguire, Vanilla Sky, and Magnolia, only to come up nearly empty handed (he received Best Actor nominations for his roles in Born on the Fourth of July, Jerry Maguire, and Magnolia). But his last two films (Minority Report and The Last Samurai), quite possibly the best chances at an Oscar nod in years based on critical as well as public acceptance, failed to produce even a nomination. Does this affect his career, let alone his own self-esteem for his craft? Hardly! Cruise continues to take risks as an actor, which includes performing in a role that doesn't suite his personality: the villain. The story centers on an ordinary man living in the big city just trying to make a decent living as a cab driver until one day he picks up the wrong guy at the wrong time and becomes embroiled in a situation he never could have imagined. For twelve years Max has been a cab driver in the city of Los Angles, a position that he envisioned would only be temporary until he saved up enough money to start his own limo service, one that would be like a `club experience', but some things in life don't always work out the way we envision them. Take for instance, one night Max picks up a man named Vincent, a person who one would describe as well put together, who `hires' him to drive him around to five locations that night for double the amount of money he would normally make in a single night. Max, believing him to be a decent hardworking guy, agrees to the deal only to shockingly discover that his occupant is actually a contract killer sent by a narco-trafficking cartel to eliminate five individuals, both witnesses and prosecutors, involved in a federal grand jury trial set to take place the next day. Though Max tries everything in his capacity, which, at times, can be quite limited, to escape, Vincent forces him at gun-point to drive him around to each location. As the increasingly distressing night drags on, Vincent and Max become more dependent on each other and begin to reveal within themselves aspects of life they never once considered before  aspects that will change the course of their own lives forever. The story for Collateral is not all that complex and, in a sense, remains fairly predictable from beginning to end but the way Michael Mann successfully blends an intoxicating atmosphere with sympathetic characters and brilliantly choreographed action sequences, that feel neither drawn-out nor short-lived, that make it the most fascinating storylines this season.One of the most striking aspects about the film is the way the filmmakers allow a small group of performers to carry the entire feature without missing a beat. Though several background characters are brought in and out throughout the film's two hour time length, they are, in essence, meaningless to the audience as many of the main actions occurring on screen primarily affect the relationship between Vincent and Max, played brilliantly by Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Tom Cruise, who is better known on the big screen for playing the hero rather then the villain, could have been disastrous had he ended up like most actors who break their usual mold, but he demonstrates that he's just as good, or even better, being bad. The grey-haired, clean-cut Vincent may seem intelligent and even debonairish in certain respects, which makes the character all the more enticing, much in the same way Anthony Hopkins portrayed Hannibal Lecter  a person so interesting and majestic that you can't help but root for him at times, though in your heart you know should be hating his guts. The other reason the character works so well is the way his acts and reacts with the character of Max the cab driver, played by Jamie Foxx. The film starts off with Max as the weak-willed, cautious pawn in the grand master-plan that he can't control, but as time goes on and their conversations become more and more profound, his personality changes in such dramatic fashion that it snaps the audience's moral compass back in line by having them root for the man they should be interested in from the beginning. Overall, Collateral started like any other film and could have ended up the disaster it should have been (based on the clear-cut final sequence it finished with) but its impressive cast, tense atmosphere, brutal violence, and, more importantly, its austere message make this film the sleeper hit of the summer. The ending is not disappointing in the sense that is flat or uninteresting but rather that if one figures out early on that Jada Pinkett-Smith's appearance in the film is more then just a mere cameo (if you caught the appearances on the late-night talk shows, this should be a given to you), the way the film wraps-up isn't all that surprising. But this hardly deters the audience from having an enjoyable experience none the less. The aspect, one that literary wizards will adore, that sets Collateral apart from other thrillers is the Richard III-ish affect it has on the reactions of the audience. Early on, we should be hating Vincent, a man who viciously kills people without any second thought, but the character is ten times more interesting then Max, who comes off as a cautious neat-freak rather then a hero, that we are easily attracted to him and, dare it be said, root for him even though we know deep inside that we should be loathing his actions. Only when the real hero emerges in Max and he finally begins to escape the precarious shell he has kept himself in do we begin to shift our attention to the person that deserves it the most. Collateral's message, one that is hammered further and further into the minds of movie-goers as the story unfolds, that life should be lived to its fullest and one should take advantage of every minute of every day. This may sound simple and even clichéd but once you've seen this film, it's easier to understand and therefore take to heart once you've exit the theater.",8,0,0,6 August 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," The Moose Hole - Review of Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban
","For the first time a film adaptation of one of the series of wildly popular Harry Potter books is presented with the most unaccustomed challenges, ones the previous two ventures had not met up with. First, Chris Columbus, who had directed both the Sorcerer's Stone and The Chamber of Secrets, has moved into the producer's chair in order to give Alfonso Cuaron, director of Y Tu Mama Tambien, a chance to take a stab at the fantasy series. Secondly, though the previous feature films had enjoyed fruitful success at the box office during the Thanksgiving holiday, the Prisoner of Azkaban is the first film in the series to open during the summer. Perhaps WB is trying to prove Harry Potter can have just as much success at changing venues as Pixar did last summer with Finding Nemo? Maybe  The most notable change for the series of film adaptations is the particular demographic it is attempting to play to. Though the first film was aimed mainly at the tweener and teenage crowds, the third movie will shift swiftly by aiming for a more mature audience, namely teens and young adults. Will too many changes all at once be too much for this film to handle? There is no doubt its opening weekend will bring in big numbers, so its final evaluation will depend mainly on the reaction of movie-goers and, of most concern to WB executives, the fans.The story once again follows the adventures of young Harry Potter, now a teenager, just as he is about to start his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. After an incident in which Mr. Dursley's snobbish sister, Marge, is blown up like a balloon after angering Harry, the wizard in training goes on the run and catches a ride aboard a bus, on which he hears about the new danger that threatens his life. For the first time, a man has escaped from Azkaban prison, the place where the wizardry world's most notorious criminals are held and Sirius Black is no different. Word going around was that he was once a trusted friend of the Potter family but unbeknownst to them he was following the dark path of Lord Voldemort, which led him to betray the Potters and reveal to the dark lord their whereabouts. Though Voldemort's following is long since disbanded, his time in Azkaban prison has led him to go mad, swearing to return to the wizard world and finish the task that his master was unable to do  by killing Harry Potter. With Black on the loose and young Harry attending school, dementors, evil creatures which guard Azkaban prison, have descended upon Hogwarts in an effort to capture the madman. But instead of presenting Harry with a finer sense of security, they present a darker threat to him, one in which he must find the light within himself to uncover additional clues needed to unlock his mysterious past. The story for Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban presents not only a continuation of the Harry Potter plot line but is successfully able to mature its stylization and atmosphere along the same lines as the series' continually aging audience. As with the previous two films, the Prisoner of Azkaban never once feels dragged on longer then it should or hurried up too quickly. It leaves the audience feeling at the end as it should, not longing to continue this particular storyline, but anticipating an entirely new adventure in the next adaptation.Though a considerable amount of the cast members from the previous two Potter outings have returned, the younger actors and actresses have gone through a considerable change, namely puberty. This doesn't hurt their performances in any way and actually contributes significantly to the idea of the series of films maturing along with its characters and audience. Daniel Radcliffe's performance will obviously be the one most critics will focus on out of all of the children and they should see a heightening sense of his acting abilities especially as he becomes ever more accustomed to the character he is playing. Depending on whether he will stick around or not, as well as the question of whether there will be, a seventh film, Radcliffe should be able to present one hell of a performance then and his maturing actions can be seen in this film. The most notable addition to the cast, at least to fans of the film series, would Michael Gambon taking on the role of Professor Dumbledore after the recent passing of venerable acting talent Richard Harris. Though his performance doesn't quite match up to Harris', Gambon gives it his best shot and maintains a certain level of charm about the character that had been seen in the previous features. Gary Oldman, notorious for his villainous roles in movies like Bram Stoker's Dracula and Air Force One, slips perfectly into the role of Sirius Black. The only disappointing aspect to his character is that not nearly enough of him is shown in the film as much as the advertisements imply. This isn't necessarily a bad mark against the film, it's actually quite reasonable considering the source on which the film is based on  it's just an annoyance. And Alan Rickman, reprising the role of Professor Snape, presents another amusing performance, though not as seen as the character had been in the previous features.Overall, director Alfonso Cuaron picks up right where Columbus left off but, in the process, stylizes the third adaptation to his own specifications and presents the most mature and darkly toned Potter film yet to grace the screen, which, in the end, makes it all the more spellbinding. With that in mind, those parents whose younger children were little more then skittish through Chamber of Secrets will have greater difficulty getting them through Prisoner of Azkaban despite the shorter time length. The best option is to view the film for yourself prior to finalizing a decision as to whether your child should see it in theaters or wait for them to mature and catch when it arrives on DVD over Christmas break. The dementors alone are enough to creep out even the most confident of adult viewers  what do you think they will do to a sensitive six year old? The rest of the film comes complete with 'jump' moments, murky atmosphere, and ominous musical score which are more then enough to set a little child up for some sleepless nights. So for the most beneficial viewing experience for both the child and the movie-going audience around them please take proper precautions prior to venturing out to the local Cineplex this summer. This is not to say that the film is a horribly frightful experience  in fact for teenagers and young adults it should be quite an entertaining film, with a wonderful blend of slight humor, eerie chills and whimsical fantasy. The only major flaw seen in the film is the level of confusion that is presented when all the pieces of the puzzle come together and the truth about Sirius Black is revealed. It's hard to describe without giving anything away but when it does appear in the film, relatively near the end, be sure to pay attention to details and actions of the characters or else it will leave slightly confused as to what is exactly going on. Other then that, Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban fails in its attempt at being one of the bigger surprises of the summer, especially for those who enjoyed the previous two films, but succeeds at being one of the more enjoyable experiences of the season.",9,0,0,4 June 2004
Meet the Fockers," The Moose Hole - 'Focker'ed Up!
","The story for Meet the Fockers no where near meets the magnificence or the brilliant humor of the original. Unlike Meet the Parents, in which the filmmakers simply ran with newfound ideas and allowed the storyline to flow consistently with little interruption, the sequel forces too much down the throats of its audience. It acts in the same way as the finale to The Matrix trilogy did in that the fanfare had built up so many ideas and theories as how it should be done that by the time it was released, no matter what would have been done or not, it was bound to disappoint someone. Sadly enough, this is the card Meet the Fockers is dealt having been released so long, nearly four years, after the original surprise hit.Both Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller return to the roles they made famous four years ago, Jack Byrnes, the ultra-conservative recently retired CIA agent, and Greg 'Gaylord' Focker, the male nurse vying for Jack's daughter's hand in marriage. They work well together once again but not quite at the level they did in the original film. Perhaps since the audience knows how they act against each other already, there are not that many surprises left and therefore less tension and humor to present to the audience. Seeing the Focker family in all their humiliating glory is the most prominent reason why this film should never have made it off the drawing board. Sure, it is quite humorous to simply imagine all the possibilities that could have been developed from this group, but when actually taking the initiative and presenting them in fresh and blood forms in front of our faces, it turns out not to be quite as pleasing as we would have thought. Choosing Dustin Hoffman for the role of Greg's father, Bernie Focker, a former lawyer and stay-at-home father, may have seemed like quite an odd choice at first, especially considering he has not had much experience in the way of flat-out comedies such as this, but now we can see why the decision was made  the man is absolutely hilarious. Who knew a talented actor such as Hoffman had this sort of comedic talent inside of him? After witnessing his performance in this film, he should seriously consider doing more of these types of films as he works quite well at least in this character. Bernie acts as a direct representation of some of the best, if not the most blundering, aspects Greg possesses. He always seems to be doing his best to please everyone but no matter what he does or how hard he tries, it perpetually ends up going badly or embarrassing for someone. The exception here is that Bernie is more cool, collected, and sound about these types of situations then Greg is. For some reason or another, everyone on the planet, Ben Stiller above everyone else, thought Barbra Streisand should play the role of Greg's mother, Roz Focker, the sexual therapist for the elderly, in the highly anticipated sequel. Whether they truly desired to see her perform once again on screen for the first time in nearly nine years or if they had to seriously consider the most annoying and embarrassing liberal hippie and her name just kept automatically coming up, the point remains the same the she works only in limited capacities. Barbra, in a way representing the film as a whole, is laughable, but not so funny as to make her performance all that memorable or worth the price of repeated admission. Most of her jokes are sexual in nature and though some of them are decent gut-busters to begin with, they grow quite old as the film drags on until a certain point where they are no longer funny and are just disgusting.Overall, the sequel to the 2000 comedy smash-hit is not quite as horrific as the filmmakers certainly could have made it, but neither is it as exhilarating and original as the first film was either. Here is yet another prime example as to why Hollywood should be prevented from being so God damn greedy as to ruin a practically pristine and memorable stand-alone film as Meet the Parents with an unnecessary and vapid sequel. After such dismaying disasters as The Whole Ten Yards and Analysis That  another film starring Robert De Niro  you would think that studio executives would have gotten that message not to bite off more then they can chew. Meet the Fockers is so testable that it should be placed on a pike in front of the entrance of every movie studio in the state of California as a constant terrifying reminder that there are some things in this world that should never be tempered with  tangible stand-alone films most of all. Honestly, the only audience members that may ever receive personal satisfaction from this lack-luster sequel in any way whatsoever will be hardcore conservatives knowing that from now on they can refer to Barbra Streisand, the queen of the banshees in Hollywood, as Mother Focker, which is worth more then anyone will know. But considering they would have to endure seeing at least twenty minutes worth of footage with her cleavage blazoned on the screen, not to mention paying money to gouge out their own eyes, they do themselves a favor and not waste their money, or their eyes, on this. True, not all of Meet the Fockers is a complete disaster. In fact it does offer quite a few laughable moments but unfortunately most audience members will find themselves forcing a laugh rather then just letting loose as real comedies should have you do.",6,1,3,16 January 2005
Seabiscuit," The Moose Hole - Review of Seabiscuit
","The end of July always seems to be a bit of a drag at the box office and no more so then this year. The summer of 2003 has been a very disappointing season with most sequels failing to live up to their predecessors and potential blockbusters falling hard just as they get out of the gate. The only highlights would be Finding Nemo and Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, both of which belong to the Walt Disney Company. Disney is leading the way as they seem to be the first studio this year to reach the $1 billion mark and could potentially win the year despite competition from The Matrix Revolutions. Though Universal is pretty far in the back of the pack (#4 at time of publication), they hope to make it up by grabbing some Oscar gold instead. The late July release date for the film may be weird choice if you want your film to be `Oscar bait' but the studio is hoping that the film will generate the same amount of buzz at last summer's Road to Perdition so when it comes to nomination time, the film will remain somewhat fresh in the mind of voters. And with the deadline for consideration pushed up this year, Seabiscuit has a lot better chance at getting a couple of nominations then 2002's Perdition. Will this `little horse film that could' impress the regular movie-going public or will too many be blinded by the shimmer of Oscar potential to notice a well based historical film?The story of Seabiscuit is based on the true story of the `little horse that could' which was depicted in Seabiscuit: An American Legend, written by Laura Hillenbrand. The film follows the events surrounding the lives of Red Pollard, Charles Howard, and Tom Smith in the 1930's. Around this time the country is desperately trying to pull itself together after The Great Depression of 1929 but nothing seems to going right for any of the main characters. Charles Howard, who made a fortune by introducing the Buick automobile to the American West, has lost his son in an automobile accident and, in event, loses his relationship with his wife. Tom Smith loses his purpose performing in the Wild West show thanks to the introduction of the automobile in the West and so goes into seclusion. And Red Pollard, who was given up by his parents during the Depression, stumbles from horse racing to boxing just trying to make a living. These three very different individuals come together after Howard purchases a gangly horse named Seabiscuit in 1938 and decides to race the horse despite overwhelming odds. With `a horse that's too small, a jockey who's too big, and a trainer who's too old', Seabiscuit gathers the attention of the public and raises the hopes of a struggling nation. The story of Seabiscuit is very well put together as there is a great blend of humor and drama, which is so rare in `Oscar bait' films. The film also does a good job of providing historical backgrounds for certain scenes by jumping outside the central story and showcasing old film reels and black & white photos. The way this is presented allows the film to set up background information that doesn't distract from the central story.The cast of Seabiscuit is the real reason why the film may have Oscar potential. Tobey Maguire, who starred in Oscar nominated Cider House Rules, became famous for his role as Peter Parker in the smash hit, Spider-Man but he is truly brilliant as Red Pollard. Maguire showcases a lot more emotion in Seabiscuit then in the role that made him famous in the mainstream and shows that he can still perform at the level of Oscar potential dramas. Chris Copper, who won an Oscar for his role in Adaptation, is wonderful as Tom Smith though his character isn't shown as much as the other three lead male roles. Elizabeth Banks, who also starred in Spider-Man with Maguire as a secretary at the Daily Bugle, receives her first lead role and does a pretty good job with it. The problem lies mostly in the fact that there is so little information given on her character, like where she came from and such, that you don't feel for her character as much as the three main leads. One of the biggest highlights of the cast is William H. Macy, who is right on target with his performance as a 1930's radio announcer. Macy rambles on with crazy one liners while being accompanied by sound effects which makes the historical background all the more engaging.Overall, Seabiscuit is a good drama that out shines the rest of the trash that clutters the local Cineplex. There are very few problems but those problems, as few as they are, hurt the film the most. The time length, which stands at nearly two and a half hours, seems to be about twenty minutes too long. The last twenty minutes of the film seem to drag on a bit longer then it should have and hurt the overall flow. Another problem was some of the transition scenes especially the area where they show Howard's son dead and then quickly move to where Howard's wife leaves him. The problem is that the musical score is played above everything else eliminating the dialogue, which doesn't seem to work at all and just causes confusion amongst the audience. Despite those problems, the film does play out better then most sports related. What makes the film all the more interesting is the historical background sequences. The scenes feel like they are straight out of a Ken Burns PBS mini-series. Another highlight is the literary quotes and references made by Red Pollard, which brings intelligence and charisma to this sports drama. Though not an absolute classic, Seabiscuit could grab some Oscar nominations that may be well deserved for an interesting story and a good old time at the box office.My Rating: **** out of 5 (Grade: B+)",8,0,0,2 August 2003
Hellboy," The Moose Hole - Review of Hellboy
","Here's come another one  another feature film adaptation of a classic comic book series. Ever since the comic book genre was revitalized by X-Men in 2000 and elevated to escalating popularity thanks to Spider-Man in 2003, it has been the top priority of every major movie studio in Hollywood to jump on the latest band wagon and grab a comic book franchise in which to roll several features, if at all possible. Granted that most of the major comic book series have been picked up and the only ones left are the less well-known franchises, but aren't the filmmakers that choose these projects all the more braver then those with the so-called `sure-fire' hits? Guillermo del Toro hasn't clearly shown that after taking the directing reins in the already hot Blade film franchise for Blade II, which managed successful to out-gross the original, but now he really gets to show how brave of a filmmaker he is with a project he's been working on for nearly six years. After shopping the experimental project around for quite some time, del Toro will now have the shot to bring the cult-classic to life but whether or not his hard work will pay off is still in the air.The story follows a young devil brought to Earth through a pagan ritual and saved by the United States Army on his journey to grow up and become a man. Nearly sixty years ago, the Nazis, in a last ditch effort to win the war against the Allied Powers, stage a cult experiment to unleash the seven gods of Chaos and destroy the world, all being led by the mysterious Grigori Rasputin. But when the United States Army intervenes, the lurid experiment goes awry and, as a result, tares the child of Satan, later named Hellboy, from his home. After he is adopted by Professor Bruttenholm, Hellboy is brought up as a force of good, rather then evil, working for the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense, protecting the world from all supernatural forces that may threaten it. His latest mission brings him in touch with the Nazi cult followers that brought him into the world sixty years ago, only this time they are adamantly determined to finish the job they started, which includes using Hellboy to fulfill his true purpose  unleashing the seven gods of Chaos and bringing about the end of the world. The story for Hellboy, as confusing and outlandish as it may seem, was surprisingly quite interesting but is definitely one that requires not necessarily a true understanding of the comic book series it is based on but an awareness of historical figures that the feature presents, as well as the legends surrounding those characters. If you go into this film without at least a reasonable sense of what is going on, you're not going to understand one solitary thing within this film. In that case, don't bother going at all  you're just going to waste your money.Unlike other comic book adaptations, Hellboy does not feature a whole lot of A-list talent but none-the-less features one of the most impressive casts this year, despite several flaws that become evident as the feature progresses. Ron Perlman is Hellboy, no ifs, ands, or buts about it! Perlman was apparently the major requirement by Guillermo del Toro when he shopped around the project and was one of the major setbacks for the project as well with the studios wanting someone more famous to play the red hero. Fortunately for movie-goers, del Toro stuck to his guns and showcases a real eye for talent with Perlman's marvelous performance. John Hurt, who portrays Professor Bruttenholm, gives a delightful performance of a character that cares dearly for his adopted son but knows clearly that his time on Earth is running out. You can't help but have a tear in your eye during his final scene in the film. There were few problems with the cast but the ones that were contrary to the rest were quite evident, this included Jeffrey Tambor and Karel Roden. It wasn't necessarily their performances but the characters themselves. Tambor plays some-what of an adversary to Hellboy in the course but you never exactly get an idea why this is. Perhaps he's the typical `uptight governmental agent who fears people different from him and therefore looks unkindly toward freaks' like Hellboy'  in that case, this just makes the character rather a lame addition to the overall story. And Roden as Rasputin? You just don't see enough of him to care or clearly grasp what he's doing in the film or trying to achieve.Overall, Hellboy lands up in purgatory, it is neither a hit nor a miss, not necessarily leaving you clamoring to see it again nor is it a feature that you would detest repeating, if it were presented to you. What it does leave you with is the feeling of wanting to know what the Hell (no pun intended) was going on and how it all makes sense, one way or another  a thing del Toro never clearly demonstrates in this film. First off, the feature, though only lasting a little over two hours, feels a lot longer then it actually is especially with several seemingly endless chase scenes. Secondly, it felt as though too much was being crammed into one film and might have been better split up but with enough problems getting this first one made it is understandable why del Toro might have getting a sequel. Third, there were several prominent instances where it felt as though the over-the-topness of the film was too much, including the scenes with Kroenen waving his swords around like that guy from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Many were expecting someone to pull a gun out, shoot the Nazi SOB, and move on from there but that never came about. And finally, concerning Kroenan, how does that work out? The man (figuring he is even human) is mostly dust but continues to do the things he does over a nearly sixty year time span  how is that possible? What keeps him, supposedly, alive? And what makes the last scene with him seem like the end of his character? Guess that's asking too much. Hellboy, in the end, becomes a comic-book fanatic's dream but the for the rest it leaves them confused.My Rating: *** ½ out of 5 (Grade: C+)",7,0,0,3 April 2004
The Incredibles," The Moose Hole - Review of The Incredibles
","Superman, Daredevil, The X-Men, and The Amazing Spider-Man  classic comic-book superheroes that have captured the imaginations of not only young children, but those young at heart as well across the world. Though they may have started off small in the two-dimensional world of the nickel comic-books, their popularity began to grow and expanded into spectacular franchises that were developed in the areas of television series, movies, and merchandising. Some have done better then others  as of this writing, Ben Affleck is still not speaking to Tobey Maguire  but no matter what the success, there will always be an audience for these fascinating figures. What is the cause for our fascinating fixation with these individuals and their seamlessly conventional plot-lines that are all basically a regurgitation of the vintage hero myth? In a way, we understand what the hero is going through and connect with the overwhelming obstacles that block his/her path to achieving his/her goal, what ever that may be. These amazing individuals are experiencing the same events we have experiences in our own lives, on an obviously different plane of course, and as they go about achieving their objectives, we look to them for inspiration in do so in our own time and place in the world.The story centers on a family of superheroes that try and go about their daily, normal lives as civil citizens while at the same time concealing their extraordinary powers in an effort to blend in with the regular populous. Bob Parr, a faithful husband and father of three children, drives every day to work for a sleazy insurance company that cares more about their stockholders then their own clients, only to drag himself back home and repeat the process for the rest of the year. While at work, Bob dreams of the glory days when he was the world's greatest superhero, known exclusively as Mr. Incredible! That all came to an end when he was sued by a man he saved who apparently didn't want to be saved (he leaped off the top of a building in an attempt to commit suicide). This, of course, set off a string of frivolous lawsuits against all superheroes, costing the American government, as well as the taxpayers of this country, millions of dollars. The league of superheroes were eventually forced into retirement and relocated to new locations in order to live out a life of solidarity and blend in with the rest of normal society, never to use their powers for the collective good of humanity again. One night, Bob discovers an envelope in his briefcase that holds a communication device asking him to come to a secret island and take care of a rampaging robot located there that has been terrorizing a scientific organization established on the tropic location. When it turns out to be a trap, the rest of his family, including his wife, daughter and son, must summon up their abilities in order to rescue the patriarch of the Incredible family and save the day before the world is doomed. The story for The Incredibles is, for the most part, unfortunately clichéd and excruciatingly predictable, but, then again, isn't every film about superheroes that way? How so? Within the first five minutes of the film, you've discovered who the villain is and determined in which direction the storyline is heading toward, which, in essence, eliminates any real surprises that would occur within the course of the two hour feature. Don't let this matter bother you too much though. The more appropriate question that should be asked about this film is whether or not The Incredibles still manages to be overly entertaining and the answer would unanimously be yes. See, that's the amazing thing about Pixar  they can take a cookie-cutter storyline, throw in a few dozen lovable characters, mind-blowing visual work, and pure-concentrated emotions, unveiling an absolutely genuine and memorable experience at the movies.Once again, as was the case with Finding Nemo, Pixar decides to live on the edge and create an animated film featuring few famous voices  actually, the only truly recognizable name would be Samuel L. Jackson  but if it worked before, it is certainly worth a second attempt at least. Craig T. Nelson, best known as for his television series Coach on ABC, fits perfectly into the voice-role of the leading man, Mr. Incredible. Nelson truly puts effort into voicing the emotions of Bob Parr  from being frustrated at work, to uninterested and down in the dumps back at home, to emotionally distraught at the possible loss of his family. This is another prominent area where Pixar excels beyond other studios, namely in choosing figures who are perfect for the leading role, not just because their name would look good on the marquee, but that they effectively move the film forward consistently and thoroughly with their emotional performance. Samuel L. Jackson, who voices the ultra-cool Frozone, is unfortunately underused in the film. Granted, he isn't a central character  he's more of a supporting role, the buddy figure to the Mr. Incredible figure, but still essential none-the-less  but he could have been given more scenes then the ones you can just as easily see located in the film's trailers. An absolute waste of perfectly good talent it would seem. John Ratzenberger, known exclusively as the lucky charm of the Pixar Animation Studios, is highly underused in this feature. This isn't asking for him to be given a leading part or anything of that sort, but let's not wait to use him for the very end, and if you do, not just a mere few words. This was disappointing to say the least but nothing to go ballistic about. And last, but not least, Edna Mode, voiced brilliantly by writer/director Brad Bird  is there anything this man can't do  is the most original and effective creation presented in the film. Viewed as the fashion feminista to the superhero stars, she may not be a central character based on the actions on screen, but audiences won't care as she manages to deliver the most laughs out of anyone else.Overall, The Incredibles, despite lacking the tenacious punch of such previous Pixar success stories as Finding Nemo and Monsters Inc., still manages to engage viewers and connect with them in such a spectacular and seamless way that it makes them - well, incredible. One of the film's main problems is its serious lack of humor, at least early on, but even when it is able to get revved up by the second half, the laughs aren't as consistent and thorough as they were in either Monsters Inc. or even Finding Nemo. Don't take this the wrong way, there are plenty of amusing sequences to be found throughout the feature  this bears repeating, Edna Mode practically steals every scene she's in  they're just fewer and farther between then has been seen in previous Pixar efforts. In reality though, this helps a lot as it allows the story to be set up properly, as predictable as it may be on the surface, and the emotional attachment to the characters to set in with audience members, so that when things really do begin to pick-up, we are in eager anticipation to witness what comes next. Another problem the feature has to deal with, besides the 'been there, done that' atmosphere it invokes, is the fact that the actions of the film begin to feel like a broken record. It just begins to feel like a continuous loop of sequences  someone's in danger then they get out of it then they're in danger again, etc. As Mr. Incredible said once, 'I feel like the maid  can we try and keep this clean for ten minutes', how about we try something and then move on with a vastly different story idea instead of the same one over and over again. These are relatively minor quips though and shouldn't be taken for too much face value when evaluating this film with your family. The talented artists and animators at Pixar Animation Studios have truly out done themselves this around. And to think, you thought you've seen everything with Finding Nemo! There are moments where you'll believe Syndrome's Island is an actual island  the palm trees, the ocean water, and the daunting aerial view of the location are astonishing. And the waterfalls  truly breathtaking. There are so few words to accurately describe the feeling you get watching the visuals of this film  this after drooling over the latest Star Wars prequel teaser trailer moments before. And finally, in all honesty, The Incredibles has to be Disney and Pixar's most adult-skewed animated feature to date  not only does it showcase an array of dramatic explosions and presumed deaths, the touchy subjects of adultery and suicide are even touched upon in the two hour film. Even though a lot of this material will probably go over the head of youngsters, be well aware that questions may pop into their inquisitive minds and may be asked of you later on, so be prepared to answer them should they come up. Bottom-line, The Incredibles may not be Pixar's most superior film to date  Finding Nemo had more adorable characters and Monsters Inc. had far more laughs  but its an entertaining family film that gives every single member of the family something to talk about for weeks, or even months, to come going into the busy holiday season.My Rating: **** ½ out of 5 (Grade: A-)",9,0,1,6 November 2004
Million Dollar Baby," The Moose Hole - 'Million Dollar' Bust
","The story for Million Dollar Baby is darn near impossible to define in precise terms. What starts out as not only an engaging and exhilarating boxing drama but also an emotionally stirring divulgence into the belief of second chances quickly, and all too suddenly, shifts gears into a pure propagandist piece. Why did things have to go so disturbingly wrong? The first two-thirds of the film showcased some of the most heart-warming, breathtaking, and all-out inspirational boxing sequences this side of Raging Bull. Truly an Oscar tour-de-force from everyone involved. And then they had to go about and kill it, so to speak, with a conclusion that felt as if someone had side-checked the audience into a brick wall.Clint Eastwood, in the role of the hard-shelled  are not all his characters that way  boxing trainer Frankie Dunn, was mainly nominated for his performance due to his marquee name  Giamatti deserved it more  but the character itself is too wild for even the most Hollywood of clichés. It is both an appalling and disturbing sight to see critics and the public alike applaud a performance in which Eastwood comes in at the end of the film through the hospital wing like the 'Angel of Death' to secretly kill a woman he raised as if she were his own daughter. Perhaps audience members were given the wrong perception on the real daughter that left him. Maybe she was the only one with the true sense about her. If you knew your father would end up doing what he did to Maggie, would you not leave him? Hilary Swank is obviously on tap to receive the Oscar for Best Actress this year at the Academy Awards for her performance as boxer in training Maggie Fitzgerald, but does she truly deserve the honor or rather is there a serious lack of true competition against her? Should she receive kudos for training excruciatingly hard for the role and floating gracefully around the boxing ring like a true woman champion? Sure, she deserves every bit of it. Should she be the one to receive two golden statuettes in such a short period of time while taking lead roles in such trash as The Core and The Gift? Not so sure about that one. Maggie also acts as a rather crude insult toward anyone from the South  in fact her entire family could actually be brought into this discussion while we are at it. In Million Dollar Baby, every individual who happens to be from the southern region of the country is portrayed as either a know-nothing country bumpkin, complete with inbred appearance, or a worthless piece of white trash that will never amount to anything in this world. This is the typical cliché of both Hollywood and the liberal establishment in general. They love it so much it kills them to see over and over again  if only.Overall, Michael Moore occultists, more accurately those left who have yet to buck up the nerve to take their Kool-Aid following the reelection of Bush-Hitler, can at most find some consolation in the fact that at least some left-wing propagandist piece could walk away with a golden statuette on Oscar night. Already the fringe leftists have a pathetic excuse for their bumbling actions claiming, 'But at least Frankie was not cruel enough to do the deed while she was sleeping. Was it not the most touching moment when they said their good-byes before the end?' Sure, perhaps someone could try explaining that one to the family of the victim of the next teenage girl that is humanely raped and murdered after her attacker had already threatened to kill her to begin with. Straight out, euthanasia is nothing more then a gussied up word used by liberal elitists to cover-up the act of cold-blooded murder, accepted only by the slack-jawed idiots churned out by donkey universities who can not put two-and-two together. 'But', they stutter 'should we truly allow those who are confined to wheelchairs, unable to move a single limb, live out the rest of their purposeless lives in utter agony?' Following that sense of logic, Christopher Reeve, in spite of whatever Brother John Edwards may believe, should have been put of his damn misery years before he actually died. This should not be a complex issue to get through anyone's head, no matter how thick they may be. Your life does not belong solely to you, it belongs to the creator. God created you specifically in his image with a purpose in this life, though we may not know it at the time, and he will take you from this world when he feels it is your determined time. You do not have the privilege of making that decision for him in any event. In spite of what some radical liberals may tell you, man is not higher up on the chain-of-command then God himself. Anything to the contrary is absolute sacrilege. In addition to that, Baby promotes the ideal that if you are able to reach the zenith of your life, the one true shot at the big time, that even if you fail doing so you will have achieved your purpose in this world and you may therefore die with a sense of dignity having nothing left to live for. Perhaps that one could be explained more clearly to Eastwood, whether he actually wins on the big night or not, by taking a quick pot-shot to his head on his way to the limo. After all, does it not make sense for him to practice what he preaches? Million Dollar Baby is positively insulting, bordering on the line of being flat-out slanderous, both to Catholicism and the dignity of humanity in general. There should be no respect left for Clint Eastwood, either in the realm of films or politics, after this travesty.",3,1,11,29 January 2005
Shrek 2," The Moose Hole - Review of Shrek 2
","Over in France, the controversial, and increasingly robust, Michael Moore is premiering his latest crap-trap, Fahrenheit 9/11, and judging by the mainly mixed reviews the documentary has received it seems President George W. Bush won't lost much sleep once this film premieres in the United States. But there is another film that is causing quite a few headaches for another high profile individual, namely Michael Eisner. That film is the highly anticipated, and rigorously promoted, sequel to Academy Award winning animated flick, Shrek. When the original fairy tale parody launched into theaters in 2001, numerous long-standing and highly devoted Disney followers rejected the film outright for its bashing of the company's fairy-tale feature film characters as well as its theme parks and company's CEO/Chairman but times have changed, so has the status of the company itself. Now Disney followers are lining up and penning out for the Dreamworks' animated feature to catch the latest inside Disney jabs. Why? How about you ask the 43% of Disney company stockholders who withheld their vote for Michael Eisner. Should Shrek 2 be proven a box office bonanza like the last one, or more so this time, then it would only add more fuel to the fire that Eisner is standing under now.The story picks up where the last film left off with the hideous ogre discovering the goodness within himself and finding true love at last. You would think they would happily ever after with that whole ordeal of the fire breathing dragon and pompous prince behind them, right? Not so fast! Shrek and Fiona barely cross the threshold when a messenger arrives to announce that the happy couple has been invited to the kingdom of Far, Far Away to attend a celebration hosted by Fiona's parents, the king and queen. Shrek is reluctant to go believing that once her parents see both of them in their less then flattering forms, they will refuse to give them their blessing but Fiona forces him to go and when they arrive  What do you know?! Shrek was right! In fact, the king is so upset that he hires a sleazy hit-man, Puss In Boots, to eliminate the caring ogre. And he isn't the only one after Shrek  so is the Fairy Godmother who's son was suppose to marry Fiona before the green one himself got there first. Now Shrek is willing to do anything, even if it means no longer being his old grungy, rude ogre self again, in order to make Fiona happy and live happily ever after. The story for Shrek 2 may seem a tad on the predictable side but the filmmakers throw in the right amount of catchy song-and-dance numbers and fairy-tale wisecracks to more then make up for the innovative story line. It runs at just the right pace and never tends to lag more then a few moments that you'll want more of the film once it ends.With the three main voice stars from the original film receiving $10 million paychecks to reprise their roles in the sequel, the film has obviously proven to have a star-studded group of voice-actors but with brand new ones joining in, can the sequel still maintain the edge that it did in the original? One major complaint from the first film was aimed at Mike Myers, who voiced the lovable green ogre, Shrek. It wasn't Myers' fault exactly or the character, it was just that the work that Myers did in the film wasn't all that funny compared to either Eddie Murphy or other parts of the film. No one need fear of a repeat in this film as Myers is given a vastly expanded script role in this go-around and delivers numerous comical moments in the film. But the biggest laughs once again come from Eddie Murphy as the likable, if not often annoying, Donkey. Murphy's voice-over performance is one of the bigger highlights of the film and he is able to improve on the character slightly to make him funnier then he was in the original film, which hard for any voice-over performer to do. Vast praise is to be given to the other big highlight of the film, Antonio Banderas, who voices Puss In Boots. What could have been a one trick pony, Banderas' voice-over, as well as the humorous situations the character is placed in ('We found catnip'  'That's not mine!'), turn Puss In Boots into another delightful and memorable animated character with quick-witted personality that every child in the audience will enjoy seeing on screen. And Jennifer Saunders is fiendishly villainous as the Fairy Godmother, one you would think would be on the side of justice and right  But then again, this is Shrek's world were talking about here! The best sequence comes near the end of the film with her singing 'Holding Out for a Hero' and the comical events that unfold thereafter with all of it timed perfectly.Overall, Shrek 2 is quite possibly one of the biggest surprises of the summer, if not the year, and is a sight for sore eyes for those vastly disappointed by both Van Helsing and Troy at this point of the summer season. The plot of the film is the most notable problem as it tended to be quite predictable especially as the film went on but, as it was previously stated, the filmmakers present the whole story in such a wonderful and humorous way that it doesn't seem to matter all that much by the end. Another small problem is the beginning of the film which starts off kind of slow and isn't as funny as the rest of the film but once things get going (around the scene where Shrek, Fiona, and Donkey travel to Far, Far Away) the feature begins to pick up pretty quickly there after. Though this isn't a huge recommendation for the film, as one can just as easily go to the music store and listen to it at home, the soundtrack which features several catchy songs, some of which are new versions of old favorites, is a big plus as much as the original film's was. Shrek 2 is one of the rare gems of the movie world  a highly touted sequel that actually lives up to the hype that it receives and surpasses even the enormously high expectations set by the original. Another rare feat this film achieves is being enjoyable family feature appropriate for the whole family, an accomplishment that is so rarely achieved outside of the realm of Disney/Pixar fare. There are some suggestive jokes within the film but most will probably fly right over the heads of young children, so it isn't anything to worry about on the part of the parents. Though it isn't perfect, Shrek 2 is sure to remain one of the most pleasant family films of the year and for that reason alone it should be one of the must-see films of the season.My Rating: **** ½ out of 5 (Grade: A-)",9,0,0,22 May 2004

Kill Bill: Vol. 1," The Moose Hole - Review of Kill Bill (Volume I)
","`Revenge is a dish best served cold.'Quentin Tarantino's fourth film and the first one since 1997's Jackie Brown takes the theme of revenge like Hamlet on steroids. It has not been an easy road for this generation's `It' director. Tarantino once worked at a video rental store before writing the script for Reservoir Dogs that he later directed. It was his directorial effort in 1994's Pulp Fiction that catapulted Tarantino, as well as the independent film company Miramax, into the Hollywood mainstream. Unfortunately his next film, Jackie Brown, which, by the way, was not written by him, was not widely accepted and then Quentin Tarantino dropped off the scene for nearly six years. In that time period he took time off to act in some films but, for the most part, the idea for Kill Bill had been bouncing around in his skull. Now that idea has burst out of that skull in all its blood spewing, gut splattering glory reuniting Pulp Fiction star, Uma Thurman, with the acclaimed cult director in a film series that pays homage to the 70's karate films that many us grew up with.The story centers on a former member of a group of assassins who seeks revenge for the actions done on to her by her former colleagues. A woman known only as The Bride has waken up from a four year comma after her former boss Bill left her for dead on the day of her wedding killing her fiancé, the wedding party and her unborn child. Unfortunately for the skilled assassin, he made one big mistake: he failed to kill her. Now that she has awakened from her living slumber, The Bride will travel the world picking off her attempted killers one by one including the mysterious Bill. First up on her list is O-Ren Ishi, aka Cottonmouth, and her group of Japanese underground assassins. They better watch out because here comes the bride! The story for Kill Bill (Volume I) is probably one of the best scripts of the year despite being only half of the true plot. In a wonderful bit of technique, Tarantino starts the film off in the middle of story then backtracks to the events that start the chain reaction of revenge. He then flashes backwards and forwards in several instances that offer the best insight into the characters the audience is about to encounter. This gives better meaning to most of the fight sequences that take place in the course of the two hour feature.A relative bunch of low-profile actors and actresses make up one of the better casts of the year for this film. Uma Thurman, who starred in Quentin Tarantino's breakout film, Pulp Fiction, once again works her magic for the talented director in probably her best film performance. Thurman gives a witty and exhilarating go around with her role as The Bride seeking revenge against her former colleagues. She presents a style to the character that makes you clamor for her all the way to the shocking break point. Lucy Liu has another kick-ass character performance as O-Ren Ishi, the leader of a group of Japanese assassins. The only problem with this role is that it makes Liu feel type-casted into this sort of character. Not that she bad at it, she's extremely effective in her performance, but you get the feeling that eventually she may get bored with these roles but if it works for her then ignore this comment. Vivica A. Fox doesn't really get to show much acting ability as her character is killed off in the first fifteen minutes of the film but what she does show is her amazing fighting moves, which is the only evidence needed to prove her worth in the film. This is only a small portion of the full cast, the rest of which will appear in Kill Bill (Volume II) coming February 20th.Overall, Kill Bill (Volume I) is a wonderful kick-off point for Quentin Tarantino's best work since Pulp Fiction, despite only being half of the entire feature. Though that being said, there are a couple of things to pick at including the well-choreographed action sequences. It wasn't exactly the sequences themselves but the rather large amount of blood and gut spilling that occurred during them that had more then one person squirming in their seats. Granted having your arm or leg cut off results in a large amount of blood loss but does that blood spew out like a fountain? The campy style of violence that occurs in Kill Bill (Volume I) may seem disturbing as the feature starts off but by the end, it doesn't seem so unnatural, which says something our culture's customization to violence and bloodshed in films. The pacing of the feature seemed well balanced but definitely dragged near the end as the film wrapped in a spin-chilling conclusion for the time being. But other then those small squabbles, Quentin Tarantino gives an eerie insight into what the concept of revenge does to the human psyche and what it could potential lead people to do if not controlled. It is said in the film, revenge is like a forest. Men (and women) can easily be lost in it and lose track of where they started or where they were going, so caution must be taken when start off on this path. The famous cult director starts off with accelerating beginning; let's hope he can deliver on what the chilling twist promises.My Rating: **** ½ out of 5",9,1,3,10 October 2003
Big Fish," The Moose Hole - Review of Big Fish
","`There are some fish that can't be caught. It's not that they're bigger or faster then the other fish, they're just touched by something extra.'Does Columbia enjoy sitting on their butts while the other studios gather Oscar praise? They started 2003 off not so promisingly with Darkness Falls and Tears of the Sun while limping through the summer with sub par hits like Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle and Bad Boys II. Is it that they have no more ambition left in them to put forth the effort? Was it the tremendous embarrassment of Gigli that is the true cause for their lack of marketing strength? If so then that is too bad. No, not because of real Oscar hope for Mona Lisa Smile (Julia Roberts doesn't need another Oscar statue) or Something's Gotta Give is gone but the fact that the studio may have had a real chance with Tim Burton's big screen adaptation of a not so well known tale, Big Fish. It may seem ordinary on the surface, the usual father/son emotionally driven story, but it is the whimsy and the magic that sets this one apart from the rest. Burton, who has had a real success for quite some time, is drawing doubt if he can bring a heart-felt tale to the screen with his track-record of weird projects but the way Columbia is looking for Oscar night at this point, it could hurt to find out.Big Fish is based on the novel of the same name by Daniel Wallace and it discusses a son's journey to discover who he father really was after years of hearing nothing but tall-tales. Edward Bloom was too big for the small town he grew up in. That was due to his high ambition, or so that is the way he tells it. William Bloom never really knew his father. Edward was either off on business trips or telling the same elaborate fantasies that his son had heard his entire life, more then once or twice. After a couple years of broken communication between them, William returns home after his mother informs him that his father is slowing dying and may pass away soon. The son returns home for one last chance to discover the man his father really was. Going through all the magical and extraordinary adventures once again, William discovers that the truth of his father was there all along, he just needed to know where to look. The story for Big Fish takes several different and elaborate stories, some that work and some that don't, and brings them together in an enjoyable heart warming feature. At times, Fish's plot seems too high for its own good and the huge elaboration of simple stories seem way over done for many to take seriously within the context of what the filmmakers are trying to get across. This leads for some scenes within the film to not come off as effectively as others. Luckily this doesn't happen too often with the course of the film.The cast consists of only two main leads (three if you count two people for the same role in different time periods) but the supporting roles provided by various talented actors and actresses are nearly as entertaining. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney share the role of Edward Bloom in various part of his life, the latter actor portraying the character as a dying old man. Finney's performance is nothing short of spectacular as Edward Bloom deteriorates as the feature moves on and as he struggles to get his son to understand the meaning behind his tall-tales. The last scene involving Finney will have anyone reaching for a tissue. That is a guarantee. McGregor provides that personal charm and spunk that makes the fantasies involving the younger Edward all the more memorable and captivating. Billy Crudup, who portrays William Bloom, seems okay but there is nothing in his performance that really stands out or equals that of Finney's performance along side him. Danny DeVito gives a delightful performance as Amos, the circus ring-leader who eventually hires Bloom to work on his show. Despite this charming performance, be warned! Unless you want horrible images of Mr. DeVito's rear end embedded in your mind, best to keep your eyes shut during a certain portion of the film. Nothing extraordinarily long but long enough. And Steve Buscemi's performance as a less then talented inspiring poet is one of the bigger highlights based on background characters.Overall, Big Fish manages to swim above its own high-watered ambition despite a flop or two too close to shore. Going into this film, one has to understand this: almost everything in the individual tales is a metaphor for something else. The conjoined Japanese twins, for example, aren't actually conjoined in real life but they are so connected to each other, despite their own personal differences, that it seems that way. Many of exaggerations within the film are marvelously well played out but there are moments where you'll be questioning what the filmmakers are trying to do. The most prominent moment(s) involves the naked woman in the river that the young Edward Bloom sees outside his car that has been submerged by a great rainstorm. Of all the other fantasy sequences, this is the one that made the least amount of sense and probably wasn't necessary. Even with a pretty well balanced two hour time length, Big Fish fluxes between consistency and incoherence with some tales struggling to keep the pace more then others. Outside of those issues, Fish is a wonderful surprise from the man who has brought us dark classics such as Batman and Beetlejuice. It manages to be funny and heartwarming without losing its message in its own sea of ambition.My Rating: **** out of 5 (Grade: B+)",8,0,0,9 January 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," The Moose Hole - Review of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
","It happens to both the best and worst of us at some time in our lives. Love . If you haven't experienced this yet just wait, you will. It is inevitable that at some time in our journey through life that we will come across someone that fascinates us so profoundly that we feel as though we could spend the rest of our lives with this magnetic individual. There is no exact science to the concept of love. Many believe that the idea of love goes beyond the reasonable or the logical to a more diverse level of the illogical, irrational, and the unreasonable. Why is it that we find ourselves attracted to people that, on the surface, seem as though they would never be compatible with our own lifestyle? Why is it that when we do fall in love with a certain individual and think at first that this is a perfect match, we find over time that less tolerable marks are more frequent on the surface? And why is it that we overlook some individuals that, although at first there is no real 'love connection' per say, we seem to have a somewhat pure liking for someone and that it takes us longer then it should to see that person for who they really are to us? Love is a complicated subject that can't be taught, it can only be experienced for what it is . utterly confusing and yet at the same time completely fulfilling.The story is a twisted and complicated tale from the same man who brought movie-going audiences such award-savvy features as Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. Joel Barish seems like the average, normal guy who stays pretty isolated from communicating his true feelings to others and yet reveals spectacular insight only to the confines of his journal. He doesn't like going on impulses and gut feelings but rather relies more on common sense and the logical sense of self-direction. That is until he meets Clementine. They flirt with each other and eventually find themselves falling in love with one another . That is until one day Joel finds out that Clementine has undergone a radical procedure to have him erased from her memory because she was unhappy. So, in an act of self-gratification, Joel decides to undergo the procedure himself, erasing every argument, every embarrassment, every thought he has had involving Clementine. But as the procedure goes on, Joel begins to realize that beyond the quarrels and the less flattering incidents there were beautiful memories that he never wants to forget. So he does the unthinkable . Joel attempts to outrun the erasers through a dizzying chase through his mind. The story for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is hauntingly brilliant and, in some cases, personally gratifying. The concepts and the feelings expressed behind the script of this film hit so hard to home that it feels as though we our seeing our own love lives played out on screen. Granted Sunshine does tend to veer off into the ridiculously absurd but when evaluating what one takes away from this film, it is pure genius.Quite amazingly this low budgeted independent feature showcases a surprising amount of A-list talent but manages to have those performers express well beyond their famous names. Jim Carrey, who has unsuccessfully attempted to make a mark in drama with lead performances in Man on the Moon and The Majestic, gives a thoroughly convincing and commanding performance in the role of Joel Barish. And Carrey's performance is only complimented by his interaction with Kate Winslet, who acts opposite of him as Clementine. Though the two give dramatically different personas to their characters and look as if they would never be quite compatible with each other based on surface actions, which is the idea the filmmakers are trying to express. It's not what is right in front of us that should define a relationship; it is the memories themselves and the experiences of the two individuals. Elijah Wood, in his first role outside the Lord of the Rings franchise which recently wrapped up in December, gives an effective performance as a man one can't help but despise for his methods of obtaining someone's affection but at the same time feel pity for his plight, which is that he feels love eludes him. And Kirsten Dunst performs well within the film despite her appearance that protrudes a sense of innocence that feels off-base or awkward that distracts from the actions of her character. Not to say that she doesn't perform well or that the character is a pointless one, not in the least, but perhaps it is the fact that her innocence, based on her name and the characters she has played, carries a stigma with her role.Overall, Sunshine, as awkward and thoroughly confusing at it may seem and is, manages to express, in the most informal of ways, the feelings and thoughts we should all have when examining a relationship, in that it is not the superficial features but the underlining memories that make it all worth while. When a relationship hits that unfortunate moment where it all seems to be breaking down, we, as human beings, seem to instantly draw ourselves to the negative aspects of that person, as Joel did early in the procedure, in an attempt of sorts to make everything right within our mind. What Eternal Sunshine successfully expresses is that when breaking down the relationship moment by moment, more often then not the happier events outweigh the bad and that should be our determining factor to keep the relationship going. Too many moments are wasted on gut-instincts and logic, when it comes to love one must live every moment for what it is because we only have one shot in this world and we might as well make it worthwhile. What happens if that relationship doesn't work? You pick yourself up, let the relationship go, and, in time, move on. If you try your best and nothing seems to work in that relationship then perhaps it will never work and you shouldn't play out a fantasy that you know will never be. We have all experienced moments where we feel as though there is opportunity to ask someone out or express how one feels for a certain individual but have chickened out due to nerves, 'gut-instincts', or views of superficial matters. Eternal Sunshine promotes the ideology of living within the present and letting the course of the matter play out as it may. If we all relied on nerves and logic, would anyone really fall in love?",9,369,454,19 March 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," The Moose Hole - The Matrix Reloaded Review
","The world we live in is not real. We are all part of a large computer program. It is not the year we think it is. Most humans believe it is the year 2003 but rather it is the year 2099 or something close to that. Machines have taken control of the world and most humans are tapped into a thing called The Matrix. Pretty weird, huh? Well, the strange premise of The Matrix caught on in 1999 and now the first sequel has been declared the movie event of 2003. Though the sequel, like its predecessor, is rated R, the highly anticipated film is still expected to break box office records faster then any other movie. It is even expected to challenge Titanic for the highest grossing film title. A huge amount of hype has been placed on the film. Fanatics have been surfing the web and chatting how excited they are about this film. You couldn't go into a movie without seeing at least a teaser trailer for the film. Now that the film has finally arrived in movie theaters across the country and soon the world, will The Matrix Reloaded live up to the hype?The story for The Matrix Reloaded does not exactly take up where the original left off. To fully understand what is going on, one must rent The Animatrix on DVD and play the Enter the Matrix game but let us say that we are not all huge fanatics like the rest of the world. Here is the simple and basic story line for The Matrix Reloaded: It is the year 2099 and man is fighting an ongoing battle with machines. Machines gained control of the world and put humans into slavery. They built a computer program called The Matrix which all are connected to except for a small few. Those small few would include Morpheus, Trinity, Neo and the people of Zion, the last human stronghold. They are continuing their fight against The Matrix and searching for the answer to this question: Why are we here? Why are doing what we do? Why us? That is as simple as you can get about this premise without confusing somebody or giving away most of the movie. It is highly recommended that you not see this film unless you have seen the original The Matrix. The story can be confusing even to those that have seen the original but it is still excellently done. It is amazing how intricate and complex the plot is that there is not a single action within the course of the film that does not have a significant action later on either in this film or in the next.The cast of The Matrix Reloaded is wonderful as it is expanded significantly from the original film. Keanu Reeves is perfectly cast as the role of Neo or The One. There was some question with the original if he could handle such an important role as this but Reeves totally proves his acting worth not only in the original but also in this film. Carrie-Ann Moss is great as Trinity. Her role is placed more center stage in this film allowing more screen time and more importance then some thought in the original film. Laurence Fishburne is, accourse, delightful as Morpheus. Fishburne is able to show more emotion with character this time around though not too much away from the normal emotions Morpheus had in the first movie. Jada Pinkett Smith is okay but one would think that her role will be bigger in The Matrix Revolutions. Monica Belluci's role is nothing more then eye candy for the young males. Her acting range is never really seen which is quite disappointing with such good word coming from her foreign films.The Matrix Reloaded is definitely the movie event of the summer but not quite as perfect as all the hype said it would be. As great as it is there are some things to pick at. What is with the constant huge kissing scenes between Neo and Trinity? Almost every time they are alone they are eating each other's face. I think after the first kissing scene we would have gotten the idea that they are in love with each other. Another thing that was a problem was the orgy scene in the city of Zion. Was that truly necessary? It went from being a totally sci-fi film to this porno flick. What was the deal with all the sexual references within the course of the film in general? Are they that desperate to attract and appeal to young teenage boys that almost every other scene has to include a sexual action or comment? You would think that this kind of film would be above all of that but guess not. Other then those comment, The Matrix Reloaded is definitely the film to see this summer. One should see this film for the special effects alone. Absolutely amazing though in parts they seemed a little much especially with the fight between Neo and the multiple Agent Smiths. The Matrix Reloaded is not perfect by any standards but maybe that is what the film makers intended it to be. It is only half a film. Remember to stick around after the credits to check out a short preview of The Matrix Revolutions opening in theaters on November 5th, 2003.My Rating: ****1/2 out of 5 (Grade: A)",9,0,0,19 May 2003

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," The Moose Hole - 'Chamber of Secrets' Opens Fabulous Surprises
","Released November 15th, 2002Director: Chris ColumbusStarring: Daniel Radcliffe, Sean Biggerstaff, David Bradley, Kenneth Branagh, Alfred Burke, John Cleese, Robbie Coltrane, Alfie Enoch, Tom Felton, Julian Glover, Rupert Grint, Richard Griffiths, Richard Harris, Shirley Henderson, Joshua Herdman, Jason Isaacs, Gemma Jones, Toby Jones, Matt Lewis, Miriam Margolyes, Rik Mayall, Hugh Mitchell, Sally Mortemore, Devon Murray, Katharine Nicholson, Edward Randell, Chris Rankin, Alan Rickman, Fiona Shaw, Maggie Smith, Ed Tudor-Pole, Julie Walters, Emma Watson, Jamie Waylett, Mark WilliamsPremise: Harry Potter (Radcliffe) has not had a good summer. Not only has he had to put up with his overbearing Aunt Petunia (Shaw) and Uncle Vernon Dursley (Griffiths) and their dread of his magical abilities, but it seems as if Harry's best friends Ron Weasley (Grint) and Hermione Granger (Watson) have forgotten him  as they haven't replied to a single one of his letters. Then, suddenly and mysteriously, house-elf Dobby appears in Harry's bedroom and warns of great danger if the aspiring wizard should attempt to return to Hogwarts. But Harry is not about to let his friends down and, with or without the support of Gilderoy Lockhart, he will confront the dark force lurking in his beloved school.   The magical world of Harry Potter and his friends is revisited with the second film in the series. The original film, Harry Potter & the Sorcerer's Stone, was met with a huge response. The film broke every record the box office held. Those record have since been broken by the release of Spider-Man but The Chamber of Secrets could offer a threat to the famous web slinger. The Chamber of Secrets is much different in that it is much darker then original which could alienate some of the key audience for the film. Will Harry Potter & the Chamber of Secrets follow in the steps of its predecessor or will it show that the original was just a mere fluke and change is not good for the series?The story goes that Harry Potter has finally returned to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry after the long break, though not without much difficulty. Apparently a house elf named Dobby has reason to belive that great danger will fall upon Mr. Potter if he returns. When Harry does return, many strange things begin to happen. Harry hears voices in the halls, people are found petrafied and the rumored Chamber of Secrets has apparently been opened. This means big trouble for the children of mudbloods or those who have no parents of wizard/witch blood. It is up to Harry and his group of friends to protect Hogwarts from impending danger within the school itself. The story of The Chamber of Secrets is the best that has been presented in a film intended for children in quite awhile. The plot keeps the audience interested in every aspect of the movie and keeps them guessing at what is to come next.The acting within the film was much better then in Harry Potter & the Sorcerer's Stone. Those actors and actresses are much comfortable with their characters and that is quite evident within the film. Daniel Radcliffe is once again great as the lead character, Harry Potter. He showcases a broad range of emotions within the film which is rarely seen in a film intended for children. Richard Harris is fabulous in his last starring role as Professor Dumbledore. This is the perfect role for a legendary actor to go off on and Richard Harris does so with great flare and style. The only problem was the character of Rondald Weasley. There was no problem with the one who played him but the character itself. In the original film he was sort of mixed character but he has now been reduced to a comedic character, which is quite disappointing.Overall, Harry Potter & the Chamber of Secrets is one of the best films of the year. The magical world of Harry Potter is brought back better then ever. Though the film was filled with much darker moments then the original, those moments made the film altogether better, They brought much more excitement to the film and made the audience feel more connected with characters and what happened to them. The story keeps the audience guessing at what is going to happen next though there were thought to be too many scares for the younger audience. Though the film is near perfection, there are flaws to it. The running time of the film which was two hours and forty minutes long seemed much too long for a film intended for children though it did help better tell the story. And the CGI character to add on the most annoying list is Dobby the house elf. He seemed fine for the plot of the film but for the most part, he was too annoying and distracting for the purpose of the story. Other then those small squabbles, Harry Potter & the Chamber of Secrets is one of the best films of the year and raises the bar for films intended for children. The film is fabulous for all ages and is a must for those who don't visit the movie theater often. One of the few films out there that actually rises above that of the original film.My Rating: ****1/2 out of 5",9,0,0,16 November 2002
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," The Moose Hole - Review of Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy
","Will Ferrell is boldly going where no Saturday Night Live! performer has gone in years  translated success from the small screen to the big screen! Not since Mike Myers made the move to feature films with Wayne's World has Hollywood seen such a comedic performer such as Will Ferrell. It isn't recent that Ferrell has been making appearances in feature films; in fact he made his feature film debut in the Mike Myers comedy, Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery in 1997. Since then he has made feature roles and cameos in numerous comedies, none of which have made anything beyond a few million dollars of their production budgets. It wasn't until 2003 when Ferrell appeared in two surprise smash-hits, Old School and Elf, and decided to leave Saturday Night Live! Since then he has become of the most sought after comedic stars in Hollywood, receiving offers both left and right and there appears to be no sign of him slowing down anytime soon.As with most sketch comedy films, the story doesn't matter as much to the audience as the laughs are all that seem to matter but Anchorman at least attempts, unlike so many others, to the plot it starts off with. Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy takes movie-goers back to the 1970s when Ron Burgundy was San Diego's top-rated news anchor and only men were allowed to read the news. But the times are changing and when an ambitious female reporter, Veronica Corningstone, comes to the Channel 4 newsroom, Ron's world begins to change and not to his liking. At first, Veronica is given 'female' oriented interest stories, like cat fashion shows, and is kept out the lime-light for the most part. But one day, Ron fails to show up to report the news on time and Veronica takes his place, only to receive her big break and become co-anchor. Things just continue to get worse the more Ron fights the fact that he is no longer San Diego's top anchorman. The story for Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy may not be the most accurate representation of the era at the time but it does manage to touch on some issues, as in the rise of feminism, that were of importance in the 1970s, although the film does not take them as seriously as they were in real life. But bottom-line is that film plays for laughs and nothing presented in this film should be taken seriously, except perhaps the representation of news anchors that are often seen on the local news today.The cast of Anchorman consists of mainly of actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live!, whether they be current or former members, as well as several others that are well accustomed to sketch comedy of this nature. Will Ferrell, who proved to Hollywood that he was comedic driving force to be reckoned with thanks to his holiday smash-hit, Elf, owns the show as the title character, Ron Burgundy. This film proves to many that Ferrell is one of the best comedic minds in the business today as he is able to turn even the dumbest material into something funny  it may not be gut-busting but it doesn't come off as stupid as it should, which is all that matters to move the film along. Christina Applegate performs reasonably in the role of Veronica Corningstone, the female newswoman who threatens Ron Burgundy's news world. It wasn't that she doesn't work well in the film; there are severely scenes between her and Will Ferrell that are particularly funny. The problem is that most of the material given to her isn't as funny as it should be. Often she is too dependent on someone like Will Ferrell to help make the scene humorous and when it comes to a scene by herself, it doesn't have the same impact as the rest of the film. David Koechner's Champ Kind, the sports reporting cowboy, is one of the bigger disappointments and becomes a character that should have been entirely cut from the film as his material more trite and annoying then anything else. Steve Carell's Brick Tamland, the mentally retarded weatherman, is one of the biggest highlights of the film and, yes, there is a jab at the Bush administration with his character (what kind of Hollywood production would it be without one of those?) but other then that, he draws some of the biggest laughs of the film. And what would a comedy such as this be without celebrity cameos? Though many of the jokes of Anchorman don't live up to other comedies, this is one area where it probably rises above anything else in the past few years, including the opening segment of Austin Powers in Goldmember. Without giving away anything, pay attention to the street-fight sequence or you may miss someone.Overall, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is dumb, immature, and lacks the consistency and technique of vastly superior comedies of the past such of Austin Powers but in a summer severely lacking in anything remotely humorous, it does the job its meant to do, making us laugh, even if years from now it will be long forgotten. One of the film's main problems is that there isn't anything excessively amusing. There are certain parts of the film that are certainly humorous, most notably the street-fight sequence between the numerous news teams, but they are few and far between. For the most part Anchorman relies on monotonous toilet humor that becomes old and tired the more they use it. It doesn't get to the point where it makes the film intolerable but it gets graze the line a bit. Another problem wasn't what was seen but rather it was the material that wasn't shown in the comedy. Remember the film's trailer? Some of the trailer's more entertaining moments don't make into the film ('Well, I'm getting a divorce and I may never see my kids again'  'Fantastic!') but according to the film's director, he ended up with about four hours worth of material which may all end up on a special edition DVD when its released later this year. The point is, despite those minor complaints, Anchorman is a pure, dumb comedy that doesn't expect to be anything more then entertaining, even if it fails to be all that memorable. In a year that has certainly lacked its share of quality comedies, let alone decent ones, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is one class act and worth the price of admission this summer.My Rating: **** out of 5 (Grade: B)",8,0,1,9 July 2004
Ray," The Moose Hole - Review of Ray
","It was tremendously heart-breaking for America to have lost not only one, but two cultural icons that had had profound impacts on the people of our nation  Ronald Reagan and Ray Charles  die within a week of each other. Unfortunately, Ray Charles' sudden passing, which occurred on June 10th, was slightly over-shadowed by the funeral processions of the late-president, but he was hardly forgotten, nor will he ever be thanks to the landmark impact he left, not only on his own, but on the current generation of artists as well. There are certainly substantial arguments over the current direction that many believe the music industry is heading toward at this moment in time but what can be said, together, is that Ray Charles will be forever remembered for leaving an influential mark on the music industry and broke barriers in order for the current generation of supposedly 'musically inclined' teen-poppers to express their own voice in the world today.The story charts the life and career of the pioneering musical sensation Ray Charles, who passed away this past summer at the age of seventy-four after primary production had been completed on the biography. Born in a poor black neighborhood of Albany, Georgia in 1930, Ray Charles Robinson never imagined the extraordinary life he would lead, but it wouldn't come easy for either him or his family and not without heavy costs in return. After the accidental death of his younger brother, Ray began to go blind starting at the age of seven and his mother, a fiercely independent and strong black woman, helped him develop his other abilities in order to better adapt to his changing environment. Ray's true gift lied with his ability to take ordinary gospel and jazz music and turn it into something spectacular, as was demonstrated by the unprecedented number of his hits he obtained in an astounding number of genres, practically unthinkable for a musician in his day. Despite marrying a beautiful former singer and having two children as well as all the wealth and fame he could have ever imagined, Ray Charles for years battled with his inner demons, including his excessive womanizing while on the road and his growing heroin addiction, as well as the psychotic side effects that haunted him for years and nearly ended the long standing career he had fought so hard for. The story for Ray should be commemorated for doing what so few bio-pictures have actually done, which is to tell the whole story, including the good times, the bad, and the down-right ugly, and unfortunately the latter may be the reason the feature's rating gets knocked down a few notches in the end. It's important that Ray Charles' incessant heroin addiction and womanizing are the primary focus of the film, as they were the demons that consumed a large portion of his life and career, but after about two hours it becomes a little depressing. This is hardly a call-to-arms for the 'hippie-dippy' view of Mr. Charles' life story but it would have been nice had some time been set aside to look at the events of his life ranging from the mid-1970s to the time of his death in the summer of 2004.As is so often the case with biographical features, don't be expecting a star-studded cast  the primary focus is, and always should be, the story's main component and nothing should distract from that, which remains true for this one as well. Let's end the discussion here and now. The votes have already been tallied up  Forget those damn recounts, honestly if people don't know how to properly fill out an election ballot in this day and age then they deserve what-ever they get  The winner for Best Actor at this year's Academy Awards will be Jamie Foxx. To be true, Foxx was cheated out of a golden-statuette for his role in the critically-acclaimed comedy Booty Call but with this one practically in the bag, all is forgiven to be sure. Seriously, Jamie Foxx gives the performance of a life-time as the legendary Ray Charles and, considering he spent numerous hours with the man himself prior to his death, nothing he does in the film seems off-key or out of place. This is one of those rare occasions in the history of cinema where witnessing a film is called for principally for the sake of one actor's astonishing performance and Foxx's take on the late-Ray Charles is it. One can picture Kerry Washington's Della Bea Robinson, the wife of Ray Charles, in comparison to Jacqueline Kennedy, another spouse of a famous figure of American culture whose 'dabbling' in the areas of drugs and women severely affected life back home. She works well with the limited screen time she's given but one has to remember that the primary focus should be on Ray specifically, so it was expected that less time would be spent on the supporting characters. And Sharon Warren, who is an apparent newcomer to the Hollywood scene according to IMDb, does an incredible job with the role of Ray's fiercely independent mother, Aretha Robinson, and reflects perfectly a woman struggling to go through life in a world she is well aware is far from fair, having her youngest son unexpectedly taken away from her and raising a blind child alone in a poor southern neighborhood. She quickly adapts her experience in life and embeds them in the young Ray in order to prevent others from treating him merely as a cripple. Unfortunately what Ray forgets along the way is that it isn't others he should be concerned about treating him as anything other then a blind-black man, it should be himself as well.Overall, Ray, in the same captivating way as the inspirational artist on which it is based, breaks away from the conventional norms, too often tied down by an over-burdening sense of political correctness, and drastically alters the way we look at the biography genre. As instrumental as the feature may be, it does have its fair share of problems that hinder it enough to prevent a spectacular rating from being given to it. First off, an annoying aspect of the feature was Hackford's constant use of flashbacks to Ray's early childhood in Albany, Georgia during the middle of several scenes throughout the movie. It would have been better had Hackford played the story of Ray Charles straight-up instead of having to resort to using ridiculous, and repeatedly awkward, flashbacks that frequently distract the audience from the current conflicts as hand. With a running time of slightly over two hours and thirty minutes, director Taylor Hackford seems to be biting off more then he can chew and gives the audience the feeling as though he is cramming too much into one film. The flow of the film may have been better had he given the thought of chopping a few unnecessary sequences in order to shorten it up a bit. And finally, the less then spectacular finale to the musical biography leaves something desperately to be desired. Giving benefit to the doubt due to the fact that Ray Charles died shortly after primary shooting had been completed on the film, the filmmakers may have been confused as to how to properly end the feature now that he had passed away. It doesn't give them a total free-pass for ending it as flatly as they did but it is, at the very least, understandable. There are, ultimately, two distinct factors that should convince you to see this film  its rocking soundtrack and the astonishing performance of comedian Jamie Foxx. The soundtrack, though, should be disqualified since anyone can just as easily purchase it either on a compact disc or download it offline (a free version was available on AOL Music at the time of this publishing) but Foxx's breakthrough performance is unlike anything seen in years and should be seen for yourself to be thoroughly convinced. Despite some minor squabbles with particular methods used by the filmmakers, it is to be sure that Ray Charles is looking down on this film at this moment and giving it, as well as the talented cast and crew who worked diligently to make this as truthful and entertaining as possible, his blessing.My Rating: **** out of 5 (Grade: B+)",8,0,2,30 October 2004
The Terminal," The Moose Hole - Review of The Terminal
","Remember a time when back in the mid-1970s when Steven Spielberg was a young inexperienced director out in the middle of the ocean with a broken down mechanical shark shooting a movie many had predicted wouldn't make a dime at the box office? Thirty years later Spielberg is laughing all the way to the bank while all his naysayers and critics grumble away in disgust and dismay. In that nearly three decade career as a director, producer and studio owner, Steven Spielberg has laid claim to some of the most celebrated feature films of all time including Close Encounter of the Third Kind, the Indiana Jones series, Schindler's List, Jurassic Park, and Saving Private Ryan. And if box office numbers have any say in anything it's that Spielberg hasn't slowed down just yet as both Minority Report and Catch Me If You Can, both of which were made within the same year, grossed a combined $300 million domestically. With no signs of slowing down any time soon, Spielberg is sticking less with features that once made the most business sense and more with projects that peck his interest the most, this time around with the concept of airplanes in The Terminal.The story for The Terminal is actually based on the true story of Merhan Karimi Nasseri who was banished from his home country of Iran in 1977 and traveled from one European city to the next seeking refugee status only to lose his briefcase in France forcing him to remain trapped in Charles de Gaulle airport where he remains there to this day. Upon arriving one morning into JFK International Airport in New York City, Viktor Navorski discovers that his homeland of Kakosia in Eastern European has become embroiled in a military coup led by rebel forces. Since the country of Kakosia no longer exists and a military embattlement has engulfed his homeland, Viktor is refused access to the United States since the government no longer recognizes his Kakosia passport or anything related to that country and will refuse to do anything with him until the war in his country is over. Until that time, Viktor Navorski can not pass the front doors onto American soil and must live within the terminal both day and night waiting for the war to end. In the meantime, Viktor befriends numerous airport personnel who request service from him to perform separate tasks in exchange for food, money, supplies, and anything else he might want while he waits for the doors to America to open. Within a nine month timespan, Viktor Navorski discovers friendship, romance, and the true realization of the American Dream without having to leave the confinement of the airport terminal building. The story for The Terminal plays much like another Tom Hanks film, Cast Away, only this time there's a lot more dialogue  too bad there isn't much substance behind those cleverly divulged words. Unfortunately the film suffers from its own unbelievable story line in that many of the scenarios that occur within the course of its two hour time length are so over the top that it is hard to take anything from them seriously. And despite having a relatively happy ending, most of the subplots that occur within the feature wrap up too neatly which, once again, derives a bit from the film's sense of believability and realism.As was said earlier, The Terminal plays like Cast Away in that Tom Hanks is the main focus of the film and that is all that truly matters when it comes to the bare bones approach for movie-goers but if you rely on more supplemental supporting characters to add to the entertainment value, you aren't going to find that here. Tom Hanks never fails to do wonders with the material that is given to him, even the rather bland and weak components presented with the character of Viktor Navorski. There are moments where you are suppose to feel sorry for this man but unfortunately he is played out so much like a running joke at times that it is hard to keep a straight face in some of the film's more serious moments. And what's worse is that that running joke becomes less humorous and more annoying as the feature goes on thus eliminating potential connection one might have with the character and the actions that occur with him on screen. One character that does not seem to work well at all is Amelia, played by Catherine-Zeta Jones, the female flight attendant Viktor falls in love with. There is a point within the film where the audience is meant to feel sorry for the character after she admits she is tired of waiting for the right man to come along in her life  then we remember she knowingly had a sexual relationship with a married man. How do you feel sorry for a person who blatantly trots around the world having promiscuous relationships openly with married men and cares only of herself and no one else? And her relationship with Viktor Navorski, in the end, becomes pointless as just when she seems 'destined' to be with him, she ends up going back to 'dating' the married man she had earlier in the film. That combined with the lost connection the audience has with the character of Viktor Navorski results in an ample void in the film's emotionally driven message.Overall, the arrival of The Terminal signals not a new surge in the creativity of director Steven Spielberg but rather it announces blatantly that the world famous director may have finally been brought back down to the level of mediocre filmmakers after spending so much time at the top. The film suffers severely from a rather predictable and emotionally confused script that wraps up nearly all its loose ends but leaves its audience scratching their heads wondering how the conclusion they received came about. The hard part is deciding what The Terminal actually is, a comedy or drama  there is enough evidence to support either side, and that is its problem. It's great that Spielberg introduces some well induced humor into the rather lifeless storyline but sadly he bunches too many gags into one time period leaving the audience confused when the direction of the film takes on a more serious tone. This is not to say that jokes that used in the film don't work well, they do, it's just that there are too many of them that they end up outbalancing the film's dramatic moments thus resulting in an uneven presentation. With both Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can and The Terminal coming off as less then impressive, especially compared to the superb work he's most known for, this should be a wake up call to the director to get his head out of the clouds (namely off the concept of airplanes) and back to the sci-fi and fantasy genres he works best with.My Rating: *** out of 5 (Grade: C)",6,0,1,19 June 2004
Bruce Almighty," The Moose Hole - Review of Bruce Almighty
","It is amazing knowing that Jim Carey has not had a new comedy, intended for the young adult crowd, in about three years. The man who was once declared a king of comedy seems to go through a bit of a dry spot in his career. Me, Myself & Irene was not the big hit everybody expected it to be especially from the directors of There's Something About Mary while his dramatic performance in The Majestic was critically hailed but the film itself was a big flop at the box office. Though he had his failures in the past four years, Carrey found success in the family hit, The Grinch. Now after some time off, Carrey returns to the comedy scene looking in top form. This time around he takes on the role of a man who thinks he can do a better job at being God then the big man himself. The question is, though, will this film do a better job then Carrey's previous misses or will his trend of failure continue?The story goes that a man named Bruce Nolan is miserable and unhappy with his life. Granted, yes, he does look to have a pretty average life with a beautiful girlfriend, a good apartment and a steady job but he is going nowhere in his life. As a human interest story reporter, Bruce is passed on promotion after promotion which are given to people that flaunt it in his face. And whenever he tries to do something nice for somebody, like helping a homeless man on the street, bad things happen because of it. Continuous bad luck drives Bruce to the breaking point and he calls upon God himself. He shouts that God is not doing his job and claims he could do a better. Hearing his shouts, he gives Bruce the opportunity almost anybody would love to have: To be God and have all his powers. There are just two rules that come with this power: First, Bruce can't tell anybody he is God, and second, he can't affect a person's free will. Will Bruce help the poor and unfortunate? Sure, after he straightens his life out first, which could take awhile. The story of Bruce Almighty is pretty good though it is not completely perfect. The film does tend to slow down quite a bit in parts of the film which can be a problem for the overall effect.
The cast of Bruce Almighty is pretty good for the most part. Jim Carrey is once again in top form as the lead character in the film. Carrey's dramatic emotions like he used in films like The Majestic actually come into use in parts of the film when serious issues are dealt with. The fact that Carrey can be so fun and then change unnoticeably into a serious state makes him an outstanding actor that is rarely seen in comedy today. Morgan Freeman is the perfect fit as God. Freeman, who has appeared in such dramatic films as Deep Impact and The Sum of All Fears, has rarely been seen in a comedy especially with the likes of Jim Carrey but he pulls the role off perfectly. Freeman's comic timing is so perfect that you wouldn't believe that he hasn't performed in many comedies. Hopefully the film's success will give him more reason to test the genre. The only real problem with the cast would be Jennifer Aniston. Granted she does look pretty in the film and presents some emotion in the film, she really does show any exceptional acting talent. For most of the film either she is crying or showing no emotion what-so-ever. She really doesn't present something to the character that the audience hasn't seen before or different from her character on Friends. Perhaps she should just stick with roles like The Good Girl, which was a critical success for her, because her comedic acting is not anything to laugh at.Overall, Bruce Almighty is another good comedic popcorn flick but nothing extraordinary. There are too many small problems that plague the film to give it huge approval. The story is good but like it was said earlier, it is not spectacular. There are many funny elements within the course of the film but the story strays into too many moments where it just falls flat while the audience waits for the next hilarious moment to appear. While talking on the subject of jokes, when is Carrey going to get off the fart and potty humor to get laughs. There are a lot of moments where he uses witty lines and such to make the audience laugh but then later in the film strays into making fart noises interrupting a news anchor. Another problem with the plot of the film is that when it does go to the serious moments, it becomes way too sappy and pushes away a lot of the audience that just came for the comedy. If you have seen any romantic comedy before this film, you basically know how it ends. Most of the film is too predictable which sort of hurts it. Not to say the film is not funny. Jim Carrey saves the day for most of the film while Morgan Freeman helps with his rarely seen comedic whit. Bruce Almighty doesn't even come close to The Matrix Reloaded but does give some laughs for those too young to see the big hit sequel.My Rating: **** out of 5 (Grade: B)",8,0,1,23 May 2003
Signs," Believe that Good Movies Can Be Release in the Summer!!
","After a string of failures at the box office for Disney like Bad Company, Reign of Fire, and The Country Bears, Disney is hoping this will be a sign of better things to come. M. Night Shyamalan has been described as the next Spielberg after the surprising success of The Sixth Sense in 1999 and the cult following of the 2000 film, Unbreakable. Now that he has conquered ghosts and superheroes, he now goes after aliens. Will Signs bring back the same success or better of The Sixth Sense, which debuted in the same weekend in 1999, or will it show the decline of the director's success?The story goes that a man by the name of Graham Hess, a former minister, has lost his faith after the death of his wife in a car accident. He soon finds that crop circles have appeared in his corn fields but dismisses them as pranks and nothing more. But soon the news from around the world shows the lights from alien space crafts and everything that we had feared about life from other worlds is coming true. An invasion by the life forms looks to happen and now Graham must find the faith within him which is the only way to save his family. The story, which was written by M. Night Shyamalan himself, is nothing but pure majesty. The plot mixes humor in well needed places and for the first time this year, I was scared more during a movie then I had ever been before. And I loved every moment of it. The story doesn't seem long or too short which is a great rarity among the modern feature-length films.Mel Gibson, who has starred in many great successful films like Braveheart, What Women Want and the Lethal Weapon series, is sure to have another huge hit with Signs. Gibson plays the role of Graham Hess down pat. He plays with so much emotion especially with the scene involving the last supper the family shares together before the alien invasion happens. The tears just stream from his eyes which made the scene just so perfect. The kids in the film were amazingly good. Some cute children will ruin a film but these kids played their roles perfectly making us laugh, cry and scared. Joaquin Phoenix has another great role after the success of Gladiator. You just cheer for him at the very end of the film, which I will not give away in this review. M. Night Shyamalan, who made a cameo appearance in The Sixth Sense, plays a much larger role in Signs and shows that his genius goes beyond directing and writing.Overall, Signs spells another huge success for director M. Night Shyamalan and actor Mel Gibson. This is the best movie I have seen in 2002 and one of the best films ever made. The scariness and the emotions go way beyond that of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. The music was perfectly scored by James Newton Howard who also scored The Sixth Sense, Dinosaur, and Atlantis: The Lost Empire. The opening credit music set us up for the greatness to come and made the credits very interesting to listen to. There are so many things to love about this film that any problems seem ridiculous. Though the ending to the film, which I will not give away, was a bit cheesy but that is what Shyamalan intended. The Sixth Sense delivered a surprise ending but Signs gives you what you should have expected but dismissed it for some surprise ending. The movie is meant to make you think as a movie goer and it does that with excellent flare and style. Signs is sure to remain the top film of the year despite heavy competition from Harry Potter & the Chamber of Secrets and The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers later this year. Make sure you make it your duty to see this film. It would be a crime to miss it. You never know when life from other worlds may visit. You would like to be prepares, right? ;)My Rating: ***** out of 5 (A Perfect Score)",10,0,2,23 August 2002
X2: X-Men United," The Moose Hole - Review of X2: X-Men United
","The beginning of the summer season always seems to open with a bang. In years past, the first major blockbuster film of the summer didn't open until Memorial Day weekend but times have changed. The first weekend of May has become the starting point now and Spider-Man solidified that with its $114.5 million opening weekend last year. This year presents another comic-book adaptation, X2: X-Men United, a sequel to the 2000 hit, X-Men. Comic book adaptations seem to be the huge rage now with past films like Spider-Man, X-Men, and Daredevil being such box office successes. But X2 is presented with a slight problem. X-Men did have a big opening weekend but started to really slow down after that with some movie-goers being disappointed. Obviously the marketing of the film will prevent X2 from being a failure at the box office but will the sequel disappoint fans like its predecessor or will an evolution occur in the movie-going experience?The story picks up where the last film left off with Magneto in jail and Professor Xavier and his X-Men fighting to protect both human and mutant kind. This time around, though, the war between mutants and the rest of humanity seems growing closer as moves made by certain people have created conflicts that will become bigger as time goes on. Due to recent events including the attempted assassination of the president by a mutant, William Stryker has sent a crew to invade Professor Xavier's School for the Gifted. But he isn't after the children. He has bigger plans involving all mutants on the planet. Now the X-Men must join up with Magneto and his group to fight for a more peaceful world. The story for X2: X-Men United was very well done but there are many elements that the normal movie-goer would not understand but a big fan of the comic-book series would. But those elements are to be expected with most comic-book adaptations like X2. This was also a problem with Daredevil, which was released in February.The cast was fabulous once again and much of the returning cast seems to be more comfortable with their rules then they were in the first film. Hugh Jackman is Wolverine. Plain and simple. Jackman proves that the role was meant for him and does it magnificently. Patrick Stewart is great once again as Professor Charles Xavier, the head of the School for the Gifted. He isn't included in as many scenes as last time but still plays an essential part in the film. Ian McKellen sends chills up backs as Magneto. He plays him so well that you would actually believe he is that character much like he did with the role of Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings series. Out of the new members of the cast, Alan Cummings is the shining light playing the role of Nightcrawler. Cummings presents much emotion to a character that you would expect to be placed in a film for special effect purposes rather then character development.Overall, X2: X-Men United is a huge leap from the somewhat disappointing original. Close to perfection, there are some things to pick at. There were some members of the cast that seemed to be pointlessly placed in the film. Among those would be Kelly Hu as Lady Deathstrike. Her character was almost pointless outside of the fight at the end with Logan. The role of Cyclops seemed to be pointless as well in this film as he was not scene almost at all except at the very beginning and at the end. There were a lot of action sequences but maybe a little too much. Eliminating one or two of the sequences would have been fine. They weren't bad, there just seemed to be too much thrown at the audience in two hours. And the ending, though magnificently done, will confuse many movie-goers not familiar with the comic-book or cartoon series. But maybe a better explanation will be shown in X-Men 3. The summer begins with a bang and if others films turn out like X2, we are in for one Hell of a summer.My Rating: ****1/2 out of 5",9,0,0,3 May 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The Moose Hole - Review of The Return of the King
","`This is your test. Every path you have trod through wilderness, through war, has led to this road.'Every film this year, both the good and the bad (or in some cases the atrociously horrible), has led to this film. Back in late-2000, there was serious doubt to whether The Lord of the Rings series, the $300 million-budgeted trilogy, would be accepted at all by the movie-going public, let alone the hardcore Tolkein fans that would critique every single move Peter Jackson made on the film adaptation. With the release of The Fellowship of the Ring in December 2001, those fears were finally put to rest with the domestic gross topping $300 million. The question would then be, will it last till the final film? At the end of The Two Tower's theatrical run, those rumblings were beginning to be quieted as the first sequel managed to out gross the original by nearly $25 million in domestic sales. Along with large box office numbers both domestically and internationally, the previous two films managed to nab numerous nominations and awards but the one thing they both weren't able to accomplish was being declared the number one film of the year they were released. The Return of the King faces little competition for the coveted spot with The Matrix Revolutions failing to surpass even the original Matrix film and Finding Nemo stalled at the $340 million mark. Considering the first sequel's achievement of surpassing the original, it more then reasonable to assume the same here but stranger things have happened in 2003.The story starts off with the tale of how Gollum came upon the ring of power and how he became what he is in the time of the Lord of the Rings films. After a graphic beginning, the plot focuses back on the developments at hand and picks up where The Two Towers left off in December 2002 with Sam and Frodo moving ever closer to Mordor unknowingly being led into a trap by Gollum. The burden of the ring of power is slowly but surely taking over the young Frodo Baggins and manipulates his mind into believing that Sam wants the ring for himself, creating further tension for the already tumultuous group. Meanwhile, Sauron's forces have been defeated at Helms Deep but the battle for Middle Earth has barely begun. The moving eye now focuses his attention on Gondor and the city of Minas Tirith, the place where Aragorn must go and take his place as the rightful king of men. Unfortunately this is easier said then done as the steward of Minas Tirith, who has guarded the throne for many years, has grown power mad and refuses to see a ranger take his place as the king of men. Many conflicts crossing every area of Middle Earth collide together as large forces, both good and evil, fight for the fate of humanity and the world. The story for The Return of the King is so wonderfully played out in such a way that you can't help but be in awe by the events that play out. Most of the credit has to go to J.R.R. Tolkein, who wrote the original books, but respect should also be given to Peter Jackson. Any other director with the level of filmmaking experience he had may have killed the purpose of the film and it's messages but he kept true to the author's vision and nobody can be more appreciative then those Tolkein fans.Most of the characters are the same as they were in the previous two features except a slight few that are introduced in The Return of the King. Elijah Wood, as the ring barring hobbit, Frodo Baggins, brings the character to a whole new level. Wood does an absolutely fantastic job at presenting a character that, not only in this film but in the previous two films as well, slowly deteriorates as the journey continues not only physically but emotionally as well. Frodo, in the third film, falls deeper into madness as the ring of powers corrupts his senses and his mind and Elijah clearly shows that development in the feature. Special praise for acting ability should also be given to Sean Astin who presents quite a few tearful sequences as Samwise Gamgee. As Frodo is changed dramatically by the ring, Sam is always there for him but this film showcases the true determination of this little hobbit and the care he has not only for his friend but his home as well. Miranda Otto will give a few feminists out there something to cheer about with a particular sequence at the battle of Minas Tirith that won't be given away here. And Sir Ian McKellen continues his magnificent performance as Gandalf the White showing not only wonderful speaking skill but quite a few good fighting hits as well.Overall, King makes many leaps and bounds above most of the films this year but fails to achieve the consistency and magnificence that The Two Towers accomplished. The biggest burden for the feature film is its excruciating three hour and twenty minute time length that feels even longer in the last fifteen to twenty minutes. There were several spots where the screen would go black or white or a particular scene would end giving the impression to the audience that the feature was over at that point until suddenly it would start a new scene seconds later. This got quite annoying after the second time and could have been done a different way. In fact, the last twenty minutes could have been cut down a lot more since it is practically the characters just saying good-bye to each other. Other problems consisted of complications based on characters and separate story developments. In the Two Towers, the audience was made to feel sorry for the creature Gollum but all those feelings can be completely thrown out the window in Return of the King. It was quite disappointing seeing the character developed into the way he was here. Whether this is done in the book or not doesn't matter, either way it was a disappointment. One loose end that wasn't quite cleared up was the romantic tensions building between Aragorn and Eowyn that is just abruptly ended by Aragorn saying it's just a false dream. They aren't seen again together till the end and there is nothing said or done to show any remaining emotions. Considering the way they built it up in the Two Towers, this just seemed incomplete and disappointing. There are other problems but focusing too much on the bad would give the impression the film is horrible, which is not the case overall. Overall, The Return of the King is a magnificent artistic achievement that is clearly not perfect but doesn't have to be to give the people what they paid for, which is wonderful action and the message that hope will survive when all else is lost. If this raises the inspiration of just one movie-goer out there, the films' message will have gotten through and achieved victory.My Rating: **** ½ out of 5 (Grade: A)",9,0,0,17 December 2003
Gangs of New York," The Moose Hole - 'Gangs' Disappoints
","After many delays, production budget problems, problems on the set and so much more, Gangs of New York finally makes it to theaters. The movie looked to never to make it to theaters after having it opening day moved from December 2001 to February 2002 to July 2002 to arrive a week before Christmas Day 2002. The $100 million budgeted film was directed by one of the most famous directors in Hollywood, Martin Scorsese. Scorsese had the idea for this film nearly 30 years ago and now his vision is brought to life even after much strife. But will this be another masterpiece for the great director or will all the problems overwhelm the Miramax film?The story goes that Amsterdam Vallon arrives in the city of New York after spending 16 years in jail. He once lived in the mean streets of New York before his father was killed by a man named Bill the Butcher, who fought to protect the rights of the 'natives' of this country. Amsterdam joins the Butcher's group of 'natives' and becomes very close to him. Along the way, he meets up with old friends who have either gone into hiding or joined the side of the 'natives'. Amsterdam soon makes the decision that the Irish immigrants can't live in such horrible conditions any longer and so goes after his father's killer for the sack of the people of America. The story of Gangs of New York is a neat one at that but by the end, the audience is way too confused. The historical aspect of the film would have been fine by itself but by adding the Amsterdam subplot, the stories get so jumbled together that it is unclear what is exactly going on.Gangs of New York is the second film for Leonardo DiCaprio to open around Christmas Day 2002 and he continues to show that he can't boast his acting ability outside of Titanic. The character of Amsterdam Vallon is way too complicated to fully understand but that is not the fault of DiCaprio. He does his best to make the audience accept as this Irish immigrant and he does a pretty good job at it. Daniel Day-Lewis was fabulous as Bill the Butcher. Lewis presents a great New York accent that makes him seem like a true American 'native' in the 1860's. The only character that didn't seem in place was Cameron Diaz's Jenny. Once again, this is not the actor's fault but of the writer's. Diaz does a good job acting this character out but by the end of the film, her character seems very pointless to the story.Overall, Gangs of New York was a big disappointment. Of the many problems, the thing that sticks out the most is the story. The era of the 1860's is a fascinating time to set a film against but the historical aspects are too jumbled together when that story is joined together with the Amsterdam Vallon story in Gangs. It was not much appreciated that the cause of the Union, which was to abolish slavery, was put in such a bad light. It is understood that many people didn't like the draft but some aspect to explain the draft should have been added. The government is looked on as a monster in this film which is not true at all. The film just seemed too dragged on. For three hours the movie looks to be going into one direction to just then turn around and go in another direction. Gangs' ending was too predictable. Scorsese could have saved at least a hour and a half of the audience's time by cutting out many unwanted scenes to direct straight to the bad ending. There are some things to like about Gangs of New York but they are so few that they not be mentioned here. See the film only if you really want to see it. If not, then wait for rental on DVD.My Rating: *** out of 5 (Grade: C)",6,0,0,12 January 2003
Shark Tale," The Moose Hole - Review of Shark Tale
","Undoubtedly one of the most famous, and most entertaining (depending on who you ask), rivalries in Hollywood would have to belong to the ongoing conflict between the Walt Disney Company and Dreamworks SKG. After Jeffrey Katzenberg left Disney in 1994 to form his own movie studio with hot-shot director Steven Spielberg, the two studios have butted heads on more then a few occasions and look to continue to do so in the future. This rivalry has gotten so bad that one or the other have accused the other of ripping off their ideas in order to profit from their success. In 1998, two animated films featuring insects opened up in theaters  PDI's Antz in October followed by Pixar's A Bug's Life less then a month later. Conveniently Dreamsworks' eventual Oscar winning animated film Shrek, featuring a monster for a lead, opened just six months prior to the release of Disney's Monsters Inc. which, obviously, focused on the world of monsters.And if this obvious trend of copy-catting isn't apparent by now then perhaps this latest match-up will. Following the smashing success of Disney/Pixar's Finding Nemo which netted $340 million domestically alone, Dreamsworks, attempting to one-up Disney before the release of their latest venture with Pixar The Incredibles, hopes Shark Tale will raise their future IPOs to sky-high levels.The story centers on a 'small fish in a big pond', also known as the ocean, who lies to become a big shot but finds out that holding up the lie was a lot harder then he originally thought. Oscar has huge aspirations for himself but little effort to back it up with. Most of the time he spends coming up with crazy 'get rich quick' schemes, for example  bottled water, and trying to persuade his boss to give him the money to enact on those plans. Unfortunately, those plans, as would be expected, never pay off and Oscar finds himself five-thousand clams in debt with his boss, who is pressuring him for the money thanks to his partnership with Don Lino, the mafia shark of the ocean. When Oscar can't pay his boss, he's tied up and dumped into the middle of a training ground for sharks, with Frankie, the oldest son of Don Lino, heading straight for him. Just as Oscar seems to be done it, an anchor mysterious falls onto Frankie's head and kills him. Since no one is around when the event occurs, Oscar makes up the story that he beat up Frankie in a fight and dubs himself 'The Sharkslayer'. This outrageous event brings Oscar a wide range of fame and fortune but when the Don discovers who he is, a bounty has been placed on his head. Oscar can't see what the fuss is all about over one teeny-tiny little white lie. The story for Shark Tale is a problem within itself, specifically there's very little of it present and any that does exist is all too generic and predictable to be called the least bit interesting, even by preschool standards. The film's entire premise and purpose is based on its trivial references to popular culture. This means that whenever there is a drought of references then the story suffers severely and slowly begins to drag. Even when references are made (for example, Corral-Cola  big laugh everyone) they aren't gut-busters, let alone thought provoking, which is the direct opposite of Pixar's line of humor.As with any Dreamworks animated venture, whether it be traditional, which has virtually gone the way of the dinosaur not just with this studio, or computer-generated, the studio devotes more time on stock-piling A-list voice-over talent rather then a more prominent issue, specifically the story, and Shark Tale is no exception to the rule. Will Smith, the former Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, voices the fast-talking fish-out of water  well, umm, fish named Oscar. If you find Smith's slick spiel and  then you'll be loathing the hour and a half of this film. There was so much promise as his fabulous performances in Men In Black and Independence Day but now it seems as though Wild, Wild West woke us up to the reality that, like the film, his choice of film projects stinks on ice. And here's a question for the older audience members, aka the parents purposely dragged to this feature by their all-too cute children, does Will Smith's Oscar not draw eerie similarities to the Incredible Mr. Limpet? Scary, huh? The problem with the film's aquatic cast of characters is not exactly their material, though that's separate problem itself, but rather it is the performers themselves. The real issue is that we've all seen, or heard, these actors and actresses play out these exact same characters in an obviously different environment. For example, Robert DeNiro as a mafia boss  Who didn't see that one coming? Granted it might have been slightly more entertaining had the filmmakers stuck with their original choice, that being James Gandolfini, but not by much. The same goes for Smith as the fast-talking and wise-cracking hero, Jolie as the sexy seductress, and Black as the dim-witted, yet lovable, sidekick.Overall, whether Shark Tale is a cheap attempt to cash in on the success of the underwater family film Finding Nemo or a lame attempt at pop culture humor, in either case it just simply doesn't work. After marveling audiences this past summer with the vastly superior Shrek 2, both Dreamworks and PDI demonstrate that someone seriously dropped the beach-ball on this one, perhaps while executives at the top were distracted counting the stockpiles of money the highly anticipated sequel brought it. It's a hard job but someone, beside the accountant, has to do it.First off, there doesn't seem to be a story with this film at all except for a striking similarity to the Brave Little Tailor, but other then that, it was basically free reign for the animators to do what they wanted. And secondly, the differences between Pixar and PDI are prominent when it comes to pop culture references. With Pixar, they concentrate primarily on the film's story and, whenever they have the opportunity to, they insert a reference to a movie or a celebrity or something like that  they never force the story into a direction for the sole purpose of a joke or base an entire film on a running-gag concept, as this film does. Shark Tale is not by any stretch of the imagination a horrible film, parts are even quite charming, but, not to give the filmmakers too much credit, does lack the originality and spunk that would deem it an enjoyable film.My Rating: *** out of 5 (Grade: C-)",6,0,1,4 October 2004
