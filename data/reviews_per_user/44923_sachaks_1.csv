The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," disappointed movie
","disappointment in the movie catching fire far superior main reasons for low score 1) lack of action 2)restiant leader was hiding most of the time 3) not good acting 4) lack of plot.1st 45 min was so boring almost walked outLots more action in catching fire ,the producers seem to think that hardily any action is required in this final part 1.Hopefully part 2 will be a lot better ,why this was split into 2 parts is beyond me .The acting of the main part was mediocre at bestTHe one action which Jennifer Lawrence had was the shooting down of the bomber and that was a short lived action part",2,40,66,20 November 2014
