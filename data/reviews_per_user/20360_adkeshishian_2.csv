Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," genuinly funny.
","This film is extremely clever, partly because it doesn't take itself very seriously. This films main character is narrow-minded, racist among other things, but that is partially why it is so funny. Another major reason why it is so funny is that it is staged like a genuine documentary for Kazakhstan about America, it seems as if it is a real documentary, but you know that it isn't.
Sacha Baron-Cohen is a master of comedy.",10,2,4,14 June 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Excellent film.
","This film's lighting, acting, soundtrack, characters, lighting and production value in general is excellent. while it is extremely long, it doesn't fell that way because this film is very entertaining and keeps you interested the whole way through. It is mostly accurate to the book with some differences. By far one of the best fantasy films I have ever seen. I would also definitely recommend you watch the extended edition. (it is much longer)",10,1,1,20 June 2019
