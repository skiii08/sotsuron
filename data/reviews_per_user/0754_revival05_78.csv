The Blair Witch Project," Realism scares. People who doesn't want to think in movies hate this
","**Warning for spoilers** **Sorry for some spellingmisstakes**
This movie is scary as hell, and I'm not saying this because I'm hyped up, or because I'm going with my friends. Actually, the way I see it, everybody hated this movie. Well that is quite frightening. Has the world gone so crazy that people excpect I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER every time they walk in to a cinema?Let's put it this way. You people who don't like this movie has many reasons not to, but no one of them really is fair. I have read almost all comments and I keep seeing the same misstake in the ''bad'' comments: You don't seem to understand it. 1. Is it scary with a pile of rocks? Answer: YES, YES, YES! I bet if you heared some strange noise in the night, and wakes up to find a pile of rocks outside your tent, you would be scared as hell! 2. Heather annoying? Answer: NO, NO, NO! Isn't her reaction pretty realistic? I mean, let's face it: One of your best friends disappear without a trace (you ALSO hear him screaming in the night, but something is wrong, it isn't him) and someones teeths poppes up. Anyone, exept for Superman, would panic and, yes, scream.3. Throw up for the cameras? Answer: This was one of the stupid comments? What did you want them to do? Keep the camera straight, even though the circumstanses? I don't think so. Didn't you know before you saw TBWP, that the camera would be like this through the entire movie? Some other comments think that it's boring, probably just because that it is not like any other horrorfilm. They maybe want to see the actual creature, but HEY! That's the scary thing about a horrormovie isn't it? The unseen evil... You know that something is out there, but you never get to see it, or at least get a clear shot. That freaks, at least me, out. You guys probably wondered where the music were, or ''where did all the gore and effects go? isn't this a horrormovie''? Yes, it is. But it is a horrormovie that is very, very, very, very scary without anything of that in it. Only using a large forest, some voodostuff, and human minds and then making a masterpiece, is pure cinema art. And something we don't see every dayREALISM SCARES HERE:First of all, the acting IS NOT BAD! It is just the fact that this is a REALISTIC PORTRAIT! This is the way they'd react too, whatever they say, and it seems to piss them off royaly.The PLOT is genius for a non-budget film. Also the 8mm is genius for a non-budget. Didn't you guys feel like this was something REAL? Didn't you get the feeling that this actually happened? Frankly this movie felt like a recording I found on the attic or something. Because I could RELATE TO THE MOVIE, IT WAS VERY REALISTIC! All these negative comments, nobody says anything about it not being realistic, because IT IS! And NOBODY EVER THOUGHT 'Hey, it was pretty realistic...Maybe that was the scary thing about it?' Well, IT WAS!Is it anybody who really honestly doesn't agree? It shouldn't but in that case, please mail me.",8,0,1,6 June 2000
Alien 3," Not very good.
","**Sorry for some spelling-misstakes**  This is the worst Alien-movie. Fincher tries to mix the dark feeling in the first movie with the 100 % action of ''Aliens''. I'm sorry Dave, it's simply doesn't work. OK, OK. I can admit it. It is entertaining at some points, but it is just because ''Alien 3'' is more of a copy of the other movies. Now, whats wrong with that picture? Everything is stolen from the other movies and you don't feel as amused of anything any more. The actors was really, really good but that can't save the bad script and the direction. I ( as a pure movielover ) will forever be gratefull for Fincher's job with ''Se7en''. This is though not one of his better movies.",Null,392,413,11 April 2000
Antz," Very funny, not directly ment for kids, movie!
",Very funny and entertaining. It's about the life for the ants. Simple isn't it? Honestly I think that ''Antz'' has many disneys behind than in front in the list. The story is about how the ant-worker Z gets into trouble while kidnapping the ant-princess by mistake. After a while a great conspiracy among the ants appear. To be a kids movie ''Antz'' seems more serious and the characters voices sure mix perfect with themselves. Not to be missed by fans of the actors/esses! 4 out of 5,Null,0,0,11 April 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Probably the most underrated film ever
","In the wait for 'Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith' I'm revisiting my previous looks on Episode I and II. While I thought they were both great pictures, I genuinely feel that 'The Phantom Menace' was a higher achievement than 'Attack of the Clones'. When 'The Phantom Menace' opened, I had been counting the days since forever it seemed, and when the lights went down I was amazed to witness this creation that had to be an awesome spectacle. A new SW-world opened as I sat amazed in the darkness. From the opening Jedi swashbuckling to the end fight with Darth Maul (man, did I love that), through the return to Tatooine and the jaw-dropping pod race, I never sunk into any second thoughts. The movie was like a gigantic wave that just threw itself over me and I dug every second of it. I assumed most people felt that way.It was more or less hated. People aimed at everything that moved in the film and they blasted away big time. I tried to cope with what people was moaning about, but against almost every argument to why this film was such a disaster I could just reply that I didn't mind. I didn't mind the midichlorians, the actors, the special effects, I wasn't ever disturbed by Jar-Jar nor Jake Lloyd. I had great fun watching this film, it was to me as enjoyable as any Star Wars film. And by that time I still really felt as a fulfilled SW-fan. I got the critics. I just couldn't understand how people could get so violently grumpy.After six years, after Episode II, The Lard Biscuit and the altered DVD-version of the 'Old Trilogy', this feeling has not been damped one bit. Instead, after watching Episode I for the oompfth time I just see more and more beauty in it. I won't nag against the critics here, since I still just simply don't agree with them, I'll just explain what I like about it, apart from it being in my eyes an utterly fantastic adventure.Come to think about it, 'The Phantom Menace' is really just one long prologue to the other films. We are introduced to the Star Wars galaxy right before things started to go wrong, fully believable with beautiful, clean-cut planets, eligible Jedi Knights and a political mess with people fumbling to save the peace from it's tremors. The plot in itself is not really that important, it's only significant through the eyes of our characters that, unlike us, have lived there for all of their lives. They care about the worries. We know it's all going to hell. We need to see the story of Naboo though, to understand why things went bad. For instance, you can't tell the story about the Vietnam War without explaining Indo-China. The occupation is nothing but a big scam, where everybody is unable to see through the smoke screens of Darth Sidious, whose vicious plans are proceeding just perfect. Also, the things that will be put in motion in this long intrigue ahead of us, have to be put in their places. We have to get introduced to this boy Anakin, the serious full-hearted Jedi apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi, Padmé, the mother of the heroes that in the end will save the day. And, of course, we have to establish that Palpatine since the beginning has always been the bad guy. Nobody in the film knows yet about their fates.The biggest difference between the new films and the old is that the old were more campy. While they still fairly includes the same amount of action and symbolism, combined with cheesy light-hearted dialogs, the old films were combined into a distinct plot, while the first installments are wider stories. This is quite natural, since there is a lot of things going on before the empire takes over. The galaxy is big, and there's a lot of people wanting to be heard. Also, there are a lot of characters that are going through different individual journeys and are yet apart from each other, without the same goal. After Palpatine takes a hold, there is not much more of a conflict than The Rebels versus The Empire. Six episodes of simple Sunday Matinée Space-Action would be too much anyway.The biggest power of Episode I has to be the craftsmanship. I have not seen such a coherent film, made with such a supreme sense of awareness, since... man, I don't know when. Seven Samurai? The Godfather? Schindler's List? George Lucas is in CONTROL of this film, and it makes the film's magnificence glow in the dark. The over-my-head impressive special effects did not feel any more fake than a rubber Jabba or the opening firework effect in Episode IV. The music was in brilliant cope with the action, in addition giving what most be the most original and fresh sounding John Williams score since 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'. And, most impressively, the overall LOOK of the film. The art and costume design, the locations and all the other details have been made in such an extreme precision that it mind blowing. Rest to sure, a lot of people have done their best and George Lucas' vision of the Star Wars universe has never been presented in such a crystal clear image as in the bright and brilliant 'Phantom Menace'.I have always believed Lucas to be sincere. The assumption that he would be a greedy soulless Jabba is populist and saddening cynicism. I always felt that he knew exactly what he was doing. This was it and he couldn't care less about fans, claiming the series as 'their own' when they don't even have the humility to listen to the creator of their beloved saga. 'What would you have CHANGED in Episode I' is a common question from fans. My answer is just a laugh. 'As if...'",10,1,4,11 May 2005
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Not to be forgotten...
","**Some spelling mistakes**                              The first Indy-movie is a perfect adventuremovie. Just look at the opening scene!                               Indiana Jones is, together with Han Solo, his best role. It's great to see him at his best! The enviroments in this movie is from all around the world, and creates the most thrilling safari-feeling ever in a movie (except for some jungle-movies like PREDATOR or JURASSIC PARK).
                              The best thing about the movie is the main score. John Williams is definitly a genius when it comes down to this.
                              All the lines are also fabolus (''Why does it have to be snakes??!!!'', ''Adios Stupido'').                               This movie is exciting and entertaining, just like the sequels, even though this is miles ahead from them.                              Rating: 8.5/10",8,0,0,19 April 2000
Casablanca," How great can a movie get?
","Maltin sure knew what he was talking about when he said that everything was right with this movie. This must be THE classic in movie making. It doesn't matter how high 'The Godfather' climbs on the film-lists all over the world, how shocking 'Psycho' is, or how many fans 'Star Wars' might have. CASABLANCA will still be the one movie for movielovers. I'm not saying that it's better than all these, but it is the most memorable movie.                              Let's go through all the factories:                              First of all: The scene. You soon get the feeling that Rick's bar is your new favorite place, your second home even if it's just a movie. The score follows the movies perfectly.                               Acting is obvious. Who'll ever forget Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in the leading roles? Paul Henreid, Claude Rains and Conrad Veidt also very good, and memorable in the side-roles. You don't want this movie to end, but what an ending it is! I really hope everyone can agree that the finale is at least one of the three best scenes ever (''Here's lookin' at you, kid'').                              Dooley Wilson does ''As time goes by'' as noone else. See this movie more than once, and then... Play it again, Sam!

Chinatown," It's a hard world. And 'Chinatown' proves it.
","--Author is aware of spelling mistakes--This is an endless masterpiece. From the start to finish I was on my seat. The suspense is all over the movie from the first to the last minute. When Faye Dunaway appears as the real wife, you think that the plot has got it's last twists. Well, you better think again. Just like I had to.
The plot ringles as a snake, and it's a ride to hang on. From the beginning you are cousing upp in the sofa, enjoying Nicholson's very fine portrait. At the end you are so frightened, so moved by the moral. You feel so totaly helpless by the end. This is Polanski's without a doubt best movie, and his appearence as the man with the knife is a great pleasure to watch, in the same scene as you see Nicholson soaked as a rat. That's also a big pleasure to watch. Polanski's way to show the incredible heat that surrounds the city is marvelous. Acting is great, to say the least. Nicholson in one of his best roles, even if I'm not really sure wich one of the great ones ('The Shining', 'One flew over the cucoo's nest', 'Mars Attacks!', 'As good as it gets') that's the best, it's a tough job to say. Faye Dunaway is not really the world's best actress, even if she's good. And I think this is the role of her life, Bonnie Parker gets close, but concidering that overrated BONNIE & CLYDE is about two times 'less good' (is that an ok term?) than CHINATOWN it gets a bit complicated to say. The plot is nothing else than a 10-pointer and Jerry Goldsmith proves that he's been around quite a while.
It is simply a very good, excelent movie with Polanski's brilliance mixed with Nicholson's brilliance. A must-see! 9/10",9,1,2,2 July 2000

But I think that the reason is one main thing: MIKE MYERS!!!! I mean, it is the exact same feeling with the AUSTIN POWERS-flicks. Nothing that's that extremely funny, but something that get's hilarius, even though it is very corny and silly.
I don't know what it is he does. Even though the extreme difference from the AP-movies, in storyline, the movies has a lot in common. First of all, there is a lot of silly jokes, hilarious spoofs, cool quotes that you never forget, a meathead as a leading character, a remarkably so what-lovestory, and, of course, Rob Lowe.

Alien: Resurrection," Not t h a t bad
","I can't really say I was expecting something great when Alien 3 sucked so bad it went out of saliva, and that the series just got worse for every sequel ( don't get me wrong, i liked ''Aliens'' but it couldn't at all match the original ). But it wasn't that bad at all. It was actually better than Alien 3. Winona Ryder has nothing to do in an Alien movie, but she's doing OK. Weaver does not look like Ripley anymore. Where did that fighter filled with pain go? The claustrofobia is wiped out and no kind of Alien feeling is left to count on. Even though I must say I kinda liked this movie. 3 out of 5.",Null,0,0,11 April 2000
Public Enemies," Chicago never looked better, but Michael Mann has made better films nonetheless
","Stanley Kubrick apparently once said that a film isn't a photograph of reality, but photograph of a photograph of a reality. In Michael Mann's Public Enemies, Johnny Depp is playing real life bank robber John Dillinger sitting in a movie theater watching Clark Gable play a gangster in a gangster movie. That's an actor portraying a gangster in a movie that a gangster played by another actor is watching in another movie. That's a photograph of a photograph of reality, an especially common phenomena in gangster movies. I don't think any gangster movie can avoid it's own mythology.And then, Public Enemies is still a gangster movie that attempts to be as naturalistic as possible. Based on a book by Bryan Burrough it's a visual spectacle of authenticity. The details are there without Mann making a fuss of it. It ain't the South of Gone With the Wind, it's simply the 30's as good as it gets in any film. In this surrounding the actors can only do it as straight as possible. Together with all of the other characters, Depp's Dillinger is peeled down until he's just a human being, walking and talking and robbing banks. We are not watching a myth come to life, nor are we spending time on the psychology couch with him. When he courts the woman of his choice (that's the kind of man this is) she attempts to make him go away by pointing out that she doesn't even know him. He says, almost annoyed, just to get it out of the way: 'I was raised on a farm in Moooresville, Indiana. My mama ran out on us when I was three, my daddy beat the hell out of me cause he didn't know no better way to raise me. I like baseball, movies, good clothes, fast cars, whiskey, and you... what else you need to know?'So, John Dillinger was excellent at robbing banks and even better at jailbreaks and that's about it. If a man like him would ever need to be a movie hero he would have to be played by Johnny Depp. He's ideal and immediately makes him inexplicably likable. This is the best quality of the film, and it's also it's weakest point. He's not likable in any romantic sense, but he's not somebody you get angry with either. It's a Rise and fall-story of an American gangster, but there's no emotions involved. The great counter-example is Christian Bale playing Melvin Purvis, the Special Agent assigned by J. Edgar Hoover to track him down. He is paradoxically cold and thorough and, great as Bale is, we understand his character even less. In fact, these two characters seem disjointed from each other as if they are both inexplicably doing something pointless for no reason. It's especially a bit of a letdown when Michael Mann have been such an expert in the past dealing with the psychological problems of destructive masculinity. The biggest comparison that comes to mind is of course Heat, the gorgeous and intelligent cops and robbers-film where Robert De Niro and Al Pacino were to meet up face to face. At times, Public Enemies inevitably feels like an unofficial prequel or remake and it does fall short by comparison. There was psychological strength and emotional heaviness there that Public Enemies deliberately avoids. What it does instead is filling the screen up with great tech stuff. Any fan of film making should see this film just to witness professionalism working in sheer, eclectic delight. Well disciplined dialog scenes are intercut with hand-held DV and delicious editing make any viewer watch these characters move along with delightful ease. Right down to casting choices, the film is in many ways impeccable - Anna Sage, the woman who eventually betrayed Dillinger, is played by the wonderful Branka Katic who was unforgettable in Emir Kusturica's wonderful 1998 comedy Black Cat, White Cat. Someone certainly had to convince someone with that choice.Public Enemies is a little tricky. It's not a bad film, but it's not entirely worthwhile either. It's a good looking film - and well dressed, with Depp and Bale in 30s suits - about a gangster who's neither Tony Montana nor a real person. We've seen it before, but on the other hand it has been done a lot worse in lesser films. At the same time: It's a good film, but Heat is better.",6,0,1,26 April 2010
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Hilarious and very entertaining.
","When I first saw this movie I thought it was so great, that I just wrote a very simple comment. Here I am to leave my point of view.                              Right now ''South Park - Bigger, longer and uncut'', is nr.27 of my favorite movies (I have really listed them all) and I must say that this is a comedy-masterpiece. From the start to finish this movie grabs you, and the usual South Park-stuff mixed with a really reasonable plot. Well, as reasonable as it could be. The way Parker & Stone has built the story up like a Brodway-musical, is genius. The songs, from ''Quiet mountain town'' to the final, through ''I can change'', ''Brian Boitano'' and ''I'm Super (thanks for asking)'', are fantastic.                               This movie was actually the movie that made me interested in musicals of any kind. I guess the plot is known, and is nothing I should grab, but even the smallest and weakest jokes gets fun.
                              The even better thing is that the movie is taking about everything from the TV-series without even feeling something like a repeating, like ''The Flintstones'' for example. Any fans, should have seen it already, but you don't have to be any kind of South Park to like this movie. In fact, where I live, you only have to be 7 years to see it! REAL scandal!                              But I still recommend this movie for anyone who can apriciate cartoon blood and violence, sarcasm (plus entertaining song) and still finding it fun.                              8.5/10",Null,0,0,19 April 2000
The Fifth Element," One of the most overrated movies ever
","Well, THE FIFTH ELEMENT is a movie by Luc Besson. Only that is a big expectation. However, THE FIFTH ELEMENT has got the same problem as even more overrated THE MATRIX. It has got effects of all kind, but nothing more. From that, it's empty. I saw this movie at it's release and didn't like it. I've seen it again, and I still don't like it. I've also kind of 'imagined' the effects away, and found a big hole. The acting is terrible. Except for Gary Oldman, who were hysteric and hilarious and Ian Holm, God he's great! Even though, I can't believe what he's doing in this trash. He's a quality-actor for God's sake! Well now. Bruce Willis was ok, but poor Milla what-ever-her-name-is was totaly awful.I believe Chris Rock, oh, I mean Chris Tucker (they are like twins) is in this movie. Seeing him, and thinking that it's really a movie by Luc Besson, who's got style, is sickening. This movie is plastic, folks! Not the usual Besson-style as in 'Nikita', 'Leon' and 'Le grand bleu'.
Besson's worst. 6/10 (and a six is pretty poor for a movie like this)",Null,5,9,9 July 2000
Batman Returns," Cool...
","The Batman-movie from 1989 is still one of my semi-favorites. This movie might not be as entertaining, but lets face it. It is one hell of a cool movie. Michelle Pfieffer and Danny DeVito are extremely hilarious as the title-baddies. Keaton is as usual a great Batman, and if that wasn't enough, Christopher Walken is swung in to it all! ''Batman Returns'' brings back some memories about that old 60-series, thinking about the evil Penguin and Catwoman. They are still a bit silly today, my theory, on purpice. Even though the nightmare-background (The Penguin is a freak that has lived in the sewers, since his parents dumped him there) you don't really think about it that much.                              ''Batman Returns'' is in many ways different from the 1989-movie. Well, the comic-action is still around, but the concept has been refreshed in a way I like.                              Even though the movie itself is quite good, It wouldn't have been the same without Keaton, Pfieffer, DeVito Walken and the great witts.                              Thrilling and cool.

X-Men Origins: Wolverine," A big budget version of a direct-to-DVD spin-off
","Most would agree that the character of Wolverine is one of the most intriguing characters in comic book history. I'm no Marvel expert, but I did grow up with the adventures of the X-Men and definitely approved of Hugh Jackman's now widely known portrayal of the scruffy Logan. I enjoyed the first X-Men, found the sequel too heavy and messy and liked the third one as comic book entertainment. All through the three movies, I probably enjoyed Jackman more than anything else. I figured the idea of making an 'origins'-movie about Wolverine could very well end up being a better movie than all of the three X-Men movies. If we concentrate on one character, I figured there could be a movie that achieves what I found the second movie failed at - being a fairly complex and character driven comic book adventure.The reason that the Wolverine-movie fails is not because the competition is tougher after The Dark Knight. It's not even because of a plot development that is beyond obvious and rudimentary - even though that certainly isn't good - no, it's because the movie doesn't even seem to try. To begin with, this does not qualify as good entertainment. There is something about the action in this movie that comes off as so very, very automatic. With no greater special effects or elements of suspense, and when one event will make you predict the following five, it almost feels like an Uwe Boll movie, imitating an action/adventure movie concept that you've seen a dozen times before. Of course, nothing in this movie is as downright awful as a piece of Bolls**t but when everybody's talking clichés as if they are part of a chain of events that is so standard, you at least make the connection and that surely is bad enough.But there is an even bigger problem. Even a generic action movie is a generic action movie and, by the way, that makes you forgive a lot of plot holes and character stupidities. I think you find the most fundamental flaw in the very title. I mean, 'Origins'. Really? What to the people behind this movie think about that title? What do they mean?? You want to know the origins of Wolverine? He grew up with his brother. They ran away from home during dramatic circumstances. Then they went off to war. All of them! The Civil War, World War I and II and Vietnam too. Why did they do this? Still unknown. Eventually, the brother (Sabertooth, played by Liev Shrieber) became evil. 'How?' you ask. I don't know, it was somewhere between Omaha Beach and Hanoi. 'Yeah, but why?' you still ask. I just said I don't know!! The movie doesn't explain. He's evil alright! 'Yeah, but... you know, 'origins''... Yeah, well that's an origin! I mean, duh! Anyway, eventually they end up with a super secret team of mutant elite soldiers. Something with the government, ho-hum. Wolvie gets enough and leave his brother. For six years he's a happy lumberjack with a loved one, who ends up a little defenseless around the time Sabretooth suddenly appears again. 'Yeaaah... but... whyyyy?' - Oh shut up! - and Wolvie decides to be a guinneapig for a bunch of evil scientist who make him a flesh-covered metal war animal. He goes after all the bad guys and they come after him and after all the fighting he ends up with his memory wiped, cue X-Men the first movie.There. That's the origin. You can also find it on the back of the DVD cover. The actual movie won't tell you anything else. With no worthwhile scenes of action, no good heroes, villains or characters in general (lines from my couch audience: Fat suit! Token black guy! Oh, I give you 200 in cash if that girl survives this movie.., That is supposed to be Gambit...? mmhm, yeah well... uh-huh, right), not one line of memorable dialog and zero lines to cover a T-shirt with, added to that the common stupid things that ruin the plausibility in general that you might usually forgive...... well, that sounds pretty much like a waste of time, right? Fans will check this out, or have already. There's no stopping that. But if you liked the X-Men movies for no other reason than that they were well-made and entertaining - see them again and do yourself no favors by trying to look for origins where there are none.",4,2,4,13 October 2009
Spider-Man 3," More complexity, less coherence - still a lot of fun
","This is my first, spontaneous reaction of Spidey 3, and I guess I have yet to see the film again, preferably on DVD, to see if I missed something.First of all, the previous 2 films made me cheer like a fool since I am a child of Marvel and even though I have not touched a Spider-Man comic book in any significant way since I was twelve, they did blow me off my seat in a mix of nostalgia and well, a sense of having that same old fun, fun, fun again. As many others, I felt that while the first film was an impressive adaption the second did kick some serious butt. All I needed from there was Venom, and I'd be sound as a pound.The third Spidey takes on a somewhat new direction. Claiming that it's 'dark' would perhaps be to overdo it (after all, Spidey will never be no Batman), but the intrigue this time is filled with a lot of complications and characters feeling fairly miserable. More importantly, I feel the film takes on a symbolic coherence in it's thematic department, something that the first two films had no interest in, since they were mostly about buttering the popcorn. Spidey 3 is in many ways a film about symbiosis and duality. Naturally, we have the alien gooey stuff which turns him into a 'bad' spider and creates Venom out of Topher Grace's nicely played Eddie Brock. But overall, the film is filled with situations where two images or personalities are standing in between each other - Harry's memory loss, the truth about the murder of Peter's Uncle Ben - and not to mention characters with fatherly angst going up against each other. For me, this is the most surprising and interesting element of the film and it sets it apart from the other two in a reasonable way - after all, what can you add to the near perfection of 'Spider-Man 2'?The critics have a point or two, even though I don't see why now's the time to be picky. The film is uneven and way too long, it has a lot of plot holes and have a lot of things going on instead of just tying together a couple of good tight few ones. It's perhaps trying too hard. But these films are often more interesting than more conventionally structured ones. I like the playfulness and the elimination of predictable dramatical events. This is not a film where the plot follows Aristotle like clockwork - it's almost passionately rough, constantly being all over the place. It could be a flaw, but I kinda like it nevertheless. A bigger problem is the slow parts in the middle of the film, where it feels like the soap opera of Parker & MJ is fairly routine stuff in the hands of Raimi & C:O (noticing Bruce Campbell is however a treat, as always). I also have some nerdy comments, like feeling that Venom is given the Darth Maul-treatment and furthermore having a hard time taking Topher Grace as Eddie Brock - he does a fine job, but it annoys the heck out of me that the physically more suitable Thomas Haden Church is stuck with Sandman (which he does splendidly as well, so I realize my comments here are pointlessly subjective).Needless to say, the action and special effects in Spidey 3 is just plain 'rocks off'-splendor. But there is also a kind of intensity, and even intelligence, in Spider-Man 3 that the two previous films did not have. On the other hand, they definitely felt more solid in structure and pace. So, in general, I had just as much fun watching the third entry as I had watching the other two.",7,1,2,7 June 2007
The Terminator," Classic movie, even though the sequel was better.
","''The Terminator'' is a masterpiece. It might not be very much of a ''cinema art'' experience but it sure is entertaining. The actors are perfect ( who can say Schwarzenegger isn't doing a bad job here ) and Cameron gets a great start as a director. Cameron did many good movies later on ( ''Aliens'' and ''Titanic'' of course included ), but his greatest work ever has got to be ''Terminator 2''. It's a lot better, but to be on the safe side, watch this movie first. 8.5 out of 10.",8,0,1,19 April 2000
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," YOU CAN'T FIGHT IN HERE! THIS IS THE WAR ROOM!
","This is Stanley Kubrick at his best. When I first saw ''DR. STRANGELOVE'' I laughed a bit. The day after I saw it again, and suddenly it all became clear to me, and now I must say that this is his best movie, together with the incredible A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. Just Dr. Strangelove himself is a classic.                               Sellers is hands down incredible in the three parts he play and without the black & White coloring it wouldn't be the same. This is an average perfect movie. You shouldn't edit it, or add more to it. How I love this holy movie!                              10/10",10,1,1,13 April 2000
Alien," Best of the Alien-movies and ( together with 2001 ) the best sci-fi movie ever
","**Sorry for some spelling-misstakes**I must say that this movie is SO, SO great! The script is genious. First building it up slowly, and carefully, nothing really happens it is only a great fog and a mysticfeeling lies over everything. Then one person gets injured and the caos startsspreading. Slowly, the crisis gets more and more a fact until there is only one person on the ship left. NO OTHER MOVIE has had this great combination before. It just takes my breath away. None of the other movies had this magic in it. Sure, ''Aliens'' was really great, but it was more of an non-stop actionmovie, ''Alien 3'' was the boring part, and ''Alien Ressurection'' was a bit better, and way more entertaining. But to put it in another way. Many people who loved the three sequels of the movie might just get really dissapointed. This is not at all like the other movies. But if you can accept this kind of slow movies you will love it! 9.5 out of 10!!!!!!",10,0,1,10 April 2000
Closer," Flawed but ultimately worthwhile
","People aren't having fun. The world isn't nice and reality is cruel. The deep core of relationships consists in the end of pure self-humiliation. The human heart looks like 'a fist covered in blood' and we should 'try lying for a change, it's the currency of the world'. This is 'Closer'. Four people that go around in circles through each other, exploring the art of heartbreaking. By the credits, all of them has been (and cheated) with each other. In the beginning, nobody is particularly happy. In the end, nobody is particularly happy.This has been seen before, but seldom in Hollywood. It is very understandable that there has been a hype surrounding this film, given that it is an American film and not, specially not, European. The raw and totally unforgiving tone is daring indeed. Mike Nichols, on the other hand, has always been dancing around the thin line of what is sentimentally 'under-the-top' and his very raw directing is of course a given trade of success for 'Closer'. The precision of the work in this film is, at moments, pure brilliant. The Production Design is always reflecting the hollow and artificial, the music is symbolic to the very last (wether The Smiths 'How Soon is Now?' or Mozart's 'Cosí fan tutte', translated 'So do they all') and while the audience never gets to witness any real love sequences, the characters are constantly finding aways of avoiding emotions when faced with them. It is very well-made and the collaboration between the elements are giving a solid rock foundation for the film which makes it deliver it's punches.There are problems, though. In an absurd way, while the themes are heavy, there is something very 'easy' about the film. If there ever was a 'feel-good'-movie playing with the audience instinctive emotions, 'Closer' is quite the 'feel-bad'-film, doing just the same. And while 'Closer' has a realistic portrayal of the real life, the film also feels somewhat unrealistic at points. The screenplay is filled with smart and overly coherent dialog, but it doesn't give anything else. In all the wit of the dialog, the coherence vanishes. The characters, specially Julia Roberts', tend to come off blank and fuzzy, going from one point to the other constantly and without any reason. Nichols' directing makes 'Closer' look the real world, but the screenplay shows us things that, without being exaggerated, still come off like something that simply doesn't happen.Still, 'Closer' is a refreshing American film. It's too shallow and unambiguously written to be any near a masterpiece, but the good craftsmanship makes it a worthwhile and recommended tragedy.",7,6,10,13 February 2005
Predator," One of my favorite nightcaps.
","I watched this movie for the fourth time yesterday, and it is now one of my 'personal classics'. My personal classics doesn't have to be great or classic, they just have to mean something to me, and the first time I saw it has got to me memorable.
PREDATOR is such a movie. I always watch it late at night, since the first time I saw it I was 7 years old at 11 p.m (I was scared as hell).In action-terms, PREDATOR is a classic, compared to other movies in the genre it ranks high, and as an actionmovie it is a 10/10. But the rating can't be based on the fact that it is an actionmovie. If you love actionfilms this is your call. It's entertaining, trigger-happy and violent packed in a suspensful and mysterious enviroment. It has got special effects and Arnold. Now I'm not the hugest action-fan, but I still liked this movie and my rating is 7/10.",7,1,2,14 June 2000
Grease," Magic!
","The fact that I'm a sucker for musicals may have an effect on me, but GREASE IS THE WORD, and it ALSO IS A VERY GOOD MOVIE. From the first second of this movie I was totally pleased, and that isn't a feeling I get very often when I watch a movie. The intro is hilarious for us who are familiar with John Travolta from movies in the 90's. He's just looks like a total dork and I couldn't stop laughing. Then the opening credits hit me and I am totally paralyzed. The rest of the movie is nothing I can put my word on, when it comes to entertainment, that is. Too bad that the directing doesn't hold up all the way.But who cares? Not me anyhow, with the unstoppable cast, coreography, sets and those gorgeous SONGS!!!! When I first heard 'Summer Nights' in this movie I was in exile, I was that pleased. But, then again, I'm a sucker for musicals. So the directing might be too 'ordinal' to make this a 10-pointer, sure it's one of the most entertaining movies ever (I think) but direction lacking is a big minus. Very often wrecks an entire film. But not here. Why? Many reasons. One of them is terrific cast. Travolta is just too cool and still so extra-ordinary dumb (that hou-hou-hou laugh for instance) and Olivia Newton-John is so very, very 'Sandra Dee' and with that accent in the middle of hyper-americans it's too great. Sidecast involving... everybody, is over the top. Kenickie and Rizzo were the best of that bunch, he was incredible in his Danny Zuko-wannabe style it had to be given credit. Rizzo was a bitch that wasn't annoying, only that is a 10. The script doesn't involve that much things, but it's better than the directing and it holds up perfectly to the rest of the movie's materials. Over to music. This is, together with acting, the best thing in the movie. Every single little song in this movie (even the Sandra Dee-reprise) is worth a 10. They are just so incredibly great it drives me crazy. Overall a very good movie, with the two ending numbers (You're the one that I want, We Go Together) that made me high. I give it 8.5, and nine, maybe even ten stars if the direction was just as spectacular.",Null,0,1,19 July 2000
Armageddon," A boring movie is closer than you think...
","''Armageddon'' is a stupid and boring movie.                               The first half is ok and entertaining for fun. But the rest of the movie made me sleep. The same things happened over and over again and it was just so unrealistic and stupid. The story is stupid, some of the dialoges are embarrassing and when the movie is over, all you can think of is the main question: Why bring a mini-gun to space? What, are they afraid of evil moon-people at NASA or what? The plot is silly, and the way everybody brags, ''These are the best oil drillers in the world'', is even more silly. The start, and fine acting raises the grade but it still doesn't worth more than 2 out of 5.",4,0,1,11 April 2000
Knowing," Anti-Armageddon, as far as Michael Bay goes
","I feel a strange shift of priorities within moviegoers today, when a movie like District 9 can use very familiar content and simply shake it around a little, and then be hailed as a masterwork of originality and become immensely popular - while a movie like Knowing will be heavily questioned and criticized beyond it's proportions despite, or perhaps due to, the fact that it actually takes an actual leap of originality. I wonder when the latest time it was I saw a Hollywood-movie end up where this one ends up. While not being perfect, Knowing still is a proper science-fiction film in the vein of 2001 - A Space Odyssey and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Certainly not as good, for various reasons, but at least clearly part of the genre.The storyline of Knowing is kind of a reversed bottle neck, by the end the multitude of the story is as big as it gets but to begin with, we are in a kind of X Files territory where we get a spooky prologue with a mystery note being dug under the ground (I won't go into the details, because it's really not important for me to go over them) and post credits we pick it up 50 years later when the note ends up in the hands of MIT professor John Koestler (Nicholas Cage) who is one of those I-lost-my-wife-so-I-lost-my-faith kind of guys, believing that the universe as we know it is all random and coincidental. Easily cracked, the numbers on the note, written by a little girl and buried for five decades, declare the dates and places of all future disasters to come, including death tolls. Cage sees 9/11 predicted from this little girls hands in 1959, as well as the Katrina and several disasters that haven't taken place yet. Without saying too much, he doesn't like what he sees at the end of the list of numbers.I have heard the movie be called predictable. Looking back, I must admit there's a lot of places where I could have seen a lot of things coming. Many quite blatant clues are placed right in the very first couple of scenes and if you know your plot and character mechanics, you would spot some obligatory scenes to come. However, I didn't. It seems I was in on the ride. The plot of the movie, I think, expands in such a methodical way that as long as you get sucked in to begin with, you don't ask any more questions. The mystery is intriguing enough to have you focus on the next shot, not the overall story. I was fairly annoyed by the story device that was seemingly on the side of the plot, dealing with Cage's kid being stalked by a couple of evil, albino trench-coat-guys looking like a bunch German electro-goths. I found that they distracted the viewer from the more interesting, down-to-earth kind of story going on with Cage. But come the ending of the movie, nothing is really earthbound and they seem kind of forgivable in retrospect. Just like in Close Encounters, Knowing is a movie that starts out cryptic but ends out in big scale cathartic satisfaction and harmony, as if it all (*all*) makes sense in the end.As for the flaws, I didn't mind the story or any of the plot holes (which mostly are arguable anyway). What did bother me probably more than anything else about the movie, though, was it's unfortunate big-time flirt with the melodrama. Take the score for instance, by Marco Beltrami, not really king of the subtle, and it's unfortunate for a movie which deals with this unusual hypothesis to have such operatic and stereotypical acting. And why, WHY, do Hollywood-movies nowadays feel the need to use those HORRIBLE matte paintings? They look like a 50's parody! As for plot, Knowing certainly bites off a lot more than it can chew. I quickly noted in the credits, with fear, that while the story credit went to one person there were like three or four guys behind the actual script. That usually means what we also get in Knowing. Messy conflicts within the narrative and sudden 'moronic behavior as plot device' from characters. Also, not every mystery thread thrown up on the floor ends up with a sensible conclusion. But despite a lot ends up as fairly arbitrary anyway, I think a lot of the questions are meant to be left unanswered. Knowing picks up a lot of ancient SF-ideas, that probably would seem tired if this genre had been over-represented in any way, and at the end of the day, you didn't ask the monkey in 2001 how he figured out how to use that piece of bone, right? In all fairness, the movie is partly a thriller so it needs certain plot devices in order for the it to have a good spook value which, I might add, it surely delivers. This is the kind of movie that creeps you out just by having a character flip a bed on to it's side. I'm not sure if these abandoned mysteries is a giant flaw or just one of those things you can roll with, but I know that it makes sure it doesn't reach the top. Knowing is a movie made I'd say for 80% entertainment, and I could say I was 80% entertained. The remaining 20% is sci-fi fodder and that made me happy too. No masterpiece then, but a good ride that I certainly will recommend.Also. I get the feeling that a lot of people who dismissed Knowing this summer were the same guys who were angry at the Bay bashers of Transformers 2. I wonder, why on Earth are the flaws of Transformers 2 forgivable, whereas the strengths of Knowing dismissible?",7,84,122,16 October 2009
The Shining," Another classic movie from Kubrick.
","Stanley Kubrick can do the topmovies in everything! A cinematic masterpiece in space traveling, a historical epic, men falling in love with young girls, black & white comedies about war, another big epic, two glorious war-movies, an extremely strong hooligan-movie. He even managed to put together two Hollywood-couples as a couple in a crashed marriage, and with the heart pounding super-scary 'THE SHINING' he proves that he even can do 80's horrormovies like no one else.
                              The decoration is scary. Long hallways, room 327, old ladies, spooky bartenders and two extremly chilling twin sisters. Ordinary doors has never seemed this scary before. The music IS one of the best things in the movie and you sure hear it when Wendy finds out what Jack has been writing all this time.                               THE SHINING is both very entertaining and highly thrilling. A perfect movie for a cold winter midnight. I hope no one will forget the acting? Scatman Crothers, fits like a glove, Danny Lloyd maybe the best child actor yet, Shelly Duvall, it's hard to believe that she is acting, and finally (tamtamtammmm) JACK NICHOLSON! This is together with BATMAN his absolute nr.1 performance.                              When you see the movie for the first time, remember. Here's Johnny, and he's here to stay! After all, this movie has frightened us for 20 years now.                              8.5/10",9,0,0,19 April 2000
American Beauty," Obviously not for everybody.
","--Includes spelling mistakesI finaly saw AMERICAN BEAUTY and, well, what can I say it DOES live up to the hype. I can actually understand those who didn't like this movie for once. You simply don't get it. Some say that it's perverted. Wow, you've gotta be a mega-moralist to say something like that. Spacey's fight to live as a 20 year old, and his psychic 40's crisis includes falling in love with 17 year olds. And of course, those who never will understand the beauty of black comedy. It's twisted, and it's supposed to be. This was what the Academy knew when the Oscars were delivered. The thing is, everybody in this movie is, more or less, out of their minds. Spacey (maybe the most healthiest in a way) loose his mind, tired of his o so boring life, numbed off by everything, he let himself loose and smoke weed, works out, works at 'Mr. Smileys' etc etc... Benning, the wife is a mental case. She's totally confused, cries when a house isn't sold (she's a stockbrocker) and 'stuff is more important than living'. She's a mental case for sure. Almost as confused as... the daughter! The typical teenager. Naive, naive, naive, unsure and confused. But she isn't as confused as her friend. A cheerleader, blonde, superbabe, sexbomb and the person that Spacey falls for. But underneath the classy surface is an unsure, confused, depressed and frightened little girl who's haunted by memories, I'd guess.
OK. So may the real psychos appear. The house next door. Thank you. First off all: The son. You just can't help but sympathize. He has got a totaly different side of the world, he films everything (dead birds=beauty, you'll understand) even Spacey's unsure daughter, his so called fascination, and his world is a big mix, not to mention he's selling pot, weed, you-name-it. But his father is a marine officer. A very tough guy, obviously too tough. Technicly the most psychic is the marine's wife. A mental case. She's litterary sick. Is that all? Yes, back to the movie:AMERICAN BEAUTY is simply a modern masterpiece. I was laughing hard at some points, fascinated at others, moved at some points and frightened, very frightened at others. It is simply everything in one and black humor is added. Of course these moralists won't understand how drugs can be funny. Not either how Spacey's fantasies can be entertaining. Well I can. It's age coming in to play, and everybody in his age (or more) should recognize themself. The movie is at the beginning a big mish mash of stories, but they all smoothly are put together at the end, and that ladies and gentlemen is beauty. The directing is not poor. Did anyone notice his teen-fantasies. They were incredible! All the roses gave a numb feeling and it was simply an experience like no other. The acting is 100 % flawless, Kevin Spacey has always been a favorite of mine and this is no exception. Benning is not just as perfect, but great, great, great. I was always thinking that the film-guy was played by Tobie Maguire. All the time! I was convinced. However he looks the same. The plot and screenplay was a 10-pointer. I couldn't imagine how the screenwriters could come up with Wes Bentley's dialogue. From the first minute to the last I was on my seat.Sure, to appriciate it 100% you've got to have no limits in watching movies, but I can tell you. Even if you guys don't like this movie, it IS NOT overrated, it WASN'T poorly directed and it ABSOLUTLY IS NOT child pornography or phedofilism! It is simply the movie of the year! 10/10",10,0,0,11 July 2000

Spider-Man," A lot of fun. Definitely
","It's with a mixed feeling of different expectations I sit down in the cinema to watch SPIDER-MAN. I had a hope to see a Great Superheroflick, in the same class as Tim Burton's masterpiece BATMAN (1989). Then I had this more realistic spidersense telling me that 'you know, this'll probably be a lot of fun, but really nothing else'. Well, my sense was more right than my hopes, but 'a lot of fun' is kind of an understatement; It's REALLY a lot of fun watching SPIDER-MAN.First off, there is two things that made me want to see this film;1. As a kid Spidey was my idol, and Marvel my heaven. This resulted in me knowing state-of-the-art-geek-stuff for the rest of my life. Therefore when time came for 'Spidey the movie', my ancient knowledge sparked to life, at least for a while, and for just a couple of hours I was all back to my 11-year-old-mania.2. My favorite director, Sam Raimi isn't, but I have faith in the man and I trust him to make a fun flick. As a horrorfan his THE EVIL DEAD (1982) remains more or less as a gift. His directing is wild and crazy, unstoppable but therefore also guaranteed to float out of the frames. But I heard Raimi would be a bit more down-to-earth, in SPIDER-MAN. Well that sounded good.Indeed, Raimi doesn't get all that carried away, even though the movie ooze from his fun directing manners. If you've seen DARKMAN (1990) or ARMY OF DARKNESS (1993) you'll see that SPIDER-MAN has the same crazed tempo. Of course BRUCE CAMPBELL does a semi-cameo, Raimi holds up his traditions. Yeah, about the actors, SPIDER-MAN's lineup gives us three stars in the leading roles, Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe and Kirsten Dunst. They are no real favs of mine, but it's a good combination: all three of them are just about as OK actors. Dafoe did his thing, Dunst was cute (as always), I think Maguire stood out making Peter Parker a truly sympathetic character. Of course, to make an a-lot-of-fun-actionadventure these days requires some heavy artilleries from the digital front. True, the digital effects are slick and perfect for the entertainment-meter. When Spidey swings around Manhattan, I can't do nothing else but kick off my shoes (I literary did this) and lean back and just enjoy the ride. 'Cause that is what you gotta do in a movie like this. Forget that it contains two love-declarations, one from Maguire and one from Dunst, that are absolutely ridiculous (and that the dialogues overall are no hotshots). Then you'll have a lot of fun. My rating is 7/10, a bit of a challanger to BATMAN RETURNS (1992) and proving that BATMAN (1989) still is the best.Buy the way. There is a Spider-Man 2 and 3 coming up. Good idea. This movie was very true to the comicbook it was based on, but Spidey lacked his unresistable wits and some of the stuff that are basic to the Spidey-reader are not yet shown off in the movie. Hopefully we'll see more of this in the sequels. Even though I wonder... Sam Neill as DocOc? Bring in Eddie Brock!",7,0,0,23 June 2002
Aliens," Second best in the series.

The acting is more of the fun kind, while it was a bit more serious in the first one. This is though the second best Alien-movie. The thought of an army of Aliens chocked the most of us back in 86 after experiencing ''Alien''. At first the feeling is a bit like the original movie. But soon you will find out that that is not the case. This is one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen in my entire life. The special effects are really cool and Cameron really makes it go fast. The tempo is fast just as ''Terminator'' and ''T2''.

Pearl Harbor," Nothing new... (contains some spoilers)
","When I see a movie that I somewhat don't appreciate, I can easily sit and search any little flaw to rack the movie down with. So I'll try not to.PEARL HARBOR doesn't put away the grease. But that's not really a secret. As usual in Hollywood Blockbusters the movie is parted in three different parts. Part one invites us to a lovestory between Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale and their friends, especially Affleck's life-long-buddy (Josh Hartnett). The lovers have one last night before Affleck has to go off to war. However he gets shot down and is reported dead. A new love story comes to life when Hartnett comforts Beckinsale. Naturally, their romance doesn't end the story. Of course, Affleck isn't dead. He returns and his longtime friend becomes an enemy. The same old story, that is. The lovestory isn't pale but it's rather predictable and I'm afraid to say the concept isn't immortal.In part two Japan bombs Pearl Harbor. The five minutes right before the actual bombing is perhaps the only really impressive thing in the whole movie. It lays a layer of suspense over America and nobody expects anything. Slowly the worries and the 'wait a minute'-feeling increase before it takes everybody with surprise. After that it's basicly an hour of war, with Affleck/Harnett and the boys confused and surprised by the attack. Cuba Gooding Jr also appears with a nice, but strangely vapid character here. It is a very well-made scenario with many big booms and powerful effects. The kind of things that doesn't need any greater thinking to enjoy. It's the best part of the movie.The third part is all about USA's big revenge against Japan. The two friends, the supporting-actors and some other pilots, are trained by a naval officer (Alec Baldwin) to execute a top secret plan; bombing Tokyo. This part is held up by Baldwin, but gets boring at many times, especially at the end when the group crash in the middle of Japanese troops.This part contains some of the most overflowing USA-cheers I've ever seen. Especially Baldwin's character talks loudly about his brave American men and teach the pilots how to say 'I'm an American' in Chineese. As the patriot he is, he would rather die than be prisoned by the Japanese.I think PEARL HARBOR has potential. But the script simply has too much clichés. I mean, do people in movies still say 'I'm so cold' before they die? The movie has some great editing and special effects, some half-vapid but OK music and the three hours pass very fast. The acting is without any bigger surprises.Jon Voight does the best job as the American president. He is a very talanted actor and he really makes a powerful and believable job. Though I sympathized mostly with the character Goose. His line 'I have a girlfriend' really got a laugh out of me.Overall I'm generous and give this movie a 6/10, and that's even though the lack of new ideas and the large number of clichés",2,0,0,7 July 2001
Quantum of Solace," Quantum of Plot
","Quantum of Solace is about as fun as watching a car crash in slow motion. All you get is the collision, but it takes forever to get to that conclusion - The car has been crushed. Yes, we noticed. When the credits rolled for this movie, I had a difficult time trying to understand what it was about or what really happened in it, or rather which parts of these loose story threads they intended to be the actual 'story' - all I knew for sure was that James Bond had killed a load of people. Actually, I'm going to make it easy on you. Quantum of Solace is about James Bond killing people. That's all you'll get from it. The verdict? Well, despite having less pretensions it is better than the downright horrible Rambo movie that came out early this year. How about that.I had problems with Casino Royale, but I was the minority, and you'll just have to let those things go. Besides, it was a well-made piece of spy action, be that as it may that I didn't connect with it in the same way others did. Point is, I went in to Quantum of Solace knowing what to expect. I knew I would have to take this movie for what it was. Problem? That's just not very much.So, the movie starts off with a routine car chase in Sierra, Italy. Along the narrow roads, Craig's bitter face is observing the random machine gun blokes in his windshield. I am already annoyed. I don't know who's to blame for this, it could be director Mark Forster or it could be the editors, but somebody is clearly not familiar with the action genre. Not only is this sequence tired and clichéd (and we are now talking about a 007 intro, where even the worst movies in the series could conjure up something imaginative in the first minutes), but it also has that classical flaw of action movies made by people with no knowledge of the genre - the scene isn't staged, but barely composed by a number of cuts. It's the easy way out, and it just becomes frantic, you loose your sense of orientation and eventually you just loose interest and starts to wait for the scene to be over, letting us get on with the movie. As the movie does get on, it is almost immediately interrupted by a chase sequence, also with every possibility to be good but spoiled by this boring mere montage of quick cuts.From then on, the movie goes on and on and on and on. We get a car chase, a boat chase, an airplane chase, a fist fight, another fist fight, a shootout, an escape run, you name it, we've got it all. But it's all done by the numbers, you may say that a movie like The World Is Not Enough (1999) was hitting the marks of the formula, but Quantum of Solace is an action movie where every scene is obligatory and on the marks. Bond enters a quiet room, closes the door behind him, takes a few steps in the room. Count to four and there's a guy jumping out from the closet. There are two plot-point characters introduced... when will one be knocked off by the bad guys and when will the other turn out to be a double-crossing spy? And as I said, all of the action sequences are done with the same type of forced editing that isn't exhilarating, but will merely give you a headache. Not only is this just another action movie, it's a bad action movie.You won't get anywhere trying to follow the story of this movie. Bond is on the trail of a crime organisation, well I guess that's natural. We don't get to know if 007 really is motivated by revenge or something else, and not in that top-of-the-iceberg/think-for-yourself kind of way, but we are simply not being told what he's thinking, what he's up to or, by that, what the point of the movie is. The villain, Greene (the only name in the movie tying to the tradition of funny names) is acting out as an environmentalist hero, but is actually in to buy up the water supply of Bolivia, by dealing with some mafia Lawrences there. Pretty exciting stuff, right?I want to write more about Quantum of Solace, but I can't find anything interesting to say about it and that pretty much sums up the whole thing. It's a cold, gray, dead and poorly executed action film that's pretty boring to watch. That's it.",4,5,8,16 November 2008
Saving Private Ryan," Indeed memorable
","Steven Spielberg is back in business again. It has been five years (at the release) with SCHINDLER'S LIST 1993, but now he strikes back better than Darth Vader's empire (who fell in JEDI anyhow). SAVING PRIVATE RYAN might not be anything out of the ordinary (the first scene is of course an exception) but it appeals to me in a strange way. The opening D-day scene is a classic piece of art.Tom Hanks (of course mr.GoodGuy) is an officer, leading Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, among others to find a private Ryan (Matt Damon) which three brothers has been killed. However you can trust the thin red line that is the plot of the mission is something to discuss, but it doesn't make the movie any worse.The realism is shocking, and the warscenes are just as intense as exciting. Great acting, and the result is simply very memorable.",8,0,0,19 April 2000
2012," Wonderfully preposterous
","I always find it amusing when people get angry with movies like 2012, saying they are an 'insult to human intelligence' and so on. I guess 2012 really would be an insult to human intelligence if it had anything to do with human intelligence. It has not. To say that Roland Emmerich is the kind of director more interested in going for the direct visual impact is quite an understatement. Kind of like saying Michael Moore is a bit of a political film maker.2012 is a good Emmerich movie, a good disaster movie and a good piece of junk food cinema. There's nothing - I mean NOTHING - here for anyone interested in character development, realism or any other kind of adequate storytelling devices. I think this is pretty much the reason it works fairly well. It all boils down to keeping it simple. The more ridiculous and huge your disaster is, the less you can risk messing around with it. The world ends, lets keep it at that. The problem with some of Emmerich's previous movies were that they fell on their own weight - The Day After Tomorrow was preposterous, yet tried to carry some kind of environmental message, and Godzilla was moronic but would probably have been more acceptable with a more charismatic monster (not named Godzilla!).In 2012, nothing is in the way for the simplistic entertainment value. The simple beauty of it can be found, for instance, in a scene featuring Danny Glover as the US Preisdent actually presenting the news to the rest of the world's leaders, by simply saying 'The world, as we know it, will soon come to an end.' WHOAH! That's quite something. It's a wonder nobody gets the impression he has lost his mind.No, it's not realistic. Yes, it's silly beyond belief. But it doesn't insult your intelligence, because I believe the movie trusts it's audience to be clever enough not to take it all that seriously. It's not like Transformers 2, which was a fantasy movie that actually was in need of some kind of consistency but just decided it wasn't important, and Emmerich is Bergman in comparison to Michael Bay anyway. In 2012 we actually get at least 30 minutes of tension building and we actually get Actors as our cardboard characters. Nothing in the movie is plausible, but it does make (it's own) sense. It's odd to me that anyone would look at the premise of 2012 - mind you, this is a story of The Mayan Apocalypse! - and not see that it's impossible to make this movie without humor and self-irony. Good character development has nothing to do with a movie like this. In fact, I dare say it would just bog it down. In a movie where the world ends at a specific date in 2012, an actor like John Cusack is certainly more than enough.So we have a movie that works despite it's lack of any real conventional quality, since it's a campy roller coaster and that's really it. Does that mean it's a GOOD movie? Not really. Call me a snob, but under the circumstances these movies operate under I can't see how they would ever be properly good. On a star rating, I'm giving 2012 six out of ten. Giving it more would indeed be an insult to human intelligence.",6,2,4,30 March 2010
I Am Legend," Much ado about nothing
","*Eventual spoilers are mild and consumer-friendly*Early on, I am Legend gives out several promises that it can't live up to. The post-apocalyptic story of the life of the one man left alive after the big wipeout - based on Richard Matheson's novel of the same name, already filmed twice in The Last Man on Earth in 1964 and The Omega Man in 1971, both films superior to this - will make you ask questions. Will Smith seems to be the sole survivor on the planet or, at least on Manhattan. He's driving around in the inner city wasteland in a scene that admittedly isn't totally unique nowadays, but nevertheless quite impressive. Several things come to mind. Why is he immune? If he has survived, surely others must? Why are animals not affected? What's his history? What happened to his family? What was his occupation? How does he function now? Also, we learn early on that this all has something to do with a positive cure for cancer discovered a couple of years prior. Emma Thompson has a cameo in the beginning as the guilty scientist. Another question - Will she turn up again? None of these questions are properly answered. Sure, answers are mentioned, either by the characters or in brief visual moments by the film itself, but we are far from closure. To begin with, the movie quickly falls into Silent Hill territory when we become aware of some scary nocturnal creatures that adds to the mystery we already have in front of us. The identity of these monsters are explained by Will Smith in one (1) monologue. Why he is immune is not explained. We don't get to know much at all about who he is and what he was doing prior to the apocalypse. His wife and family appear in brief flashbacks. Their fate is dealt with as if censored from the movie. The cancer origin thing is still unknown. Will Smith attempts to find a cure to the apocalyptic virus. It goes bad until it goes well. And no, I don't know what Emma Thompson was doing in the beginning of the movie.By the third part of the movie, I realised I didn't really cared about it. The screenplay, by Akiva Goldsman and Mark Protosevich, is filled with nice-sounding lines that are supposed to explain Will Smith's character, but when the time comes for the movie to get closer to it's finale it turns out it can't walk the walk at all. There's no psychology to the character, which is a pity given that Will Smith is really doing his very best as an actor, and there's no proper reality in the situation of the movie either. Early on, we get the idea of a movie that knows what it's doing but all we really get in the end is a bunch of loose ends. All in all, if a moody Will Smith and CGI ghouls is all you require for your science fiction entertainment, you might enjoy this in quite an uncomplicated way. I can't see how it's about much else. And, well, there you have it.",5,3,4,6 April 2010
Kick-Ass," Old hero in a new costume
","The mood was elevated in the cinema house when I saw a pre-release of this movie the other night. People were at several times applauding the screen. I'm not sure, because I was heading out for the restrooms, but people might have been doing a standing ovation during the credits.So what do I know, right? I got a similar reaction to District 9 which was a movie that people were overwhelmed with, despite the fact that it really had not one single new concept and no real impressive sign of originality to match what people had been saying. District 9 did for the sci-fi genre kind of what this movie, Kick-Ass, is trying to do with the superhero movie I think. District 9 was still a good film though. I don't think Kick-Ass is a particularly good film. And I doubt people will hail it as a masterwork of originality.The plot of the movie: Nerdy high school guy becomes famous superhero, fights street thugs, teams up with high tech gadget doctor (sic), takes on an evil empire, in this case a drug lord, they fight, get caught, fight, get caught. Big booms. Oh, and yeah he gets a girlfriend and all of that too. The movie is stylish and flashy and consistently self- apologetic, the beginning of the movie starts out with such a distance to the superhero genre that you almost believe you are watching a spoof. A kid wants to become a superhero, calls himself Kick-Ass and gets dressed up and starts walking the streets. As it is said in the movie, he should change his name to 'ass-kick' because that's all he gets. Thus he joins the likes of Blankman and the Mystery Men. Kick-Ass, though, is the first superhero pastische that people seem to like. Or so I thought halfway into the movie, before the forty minute mark or so when it gets all carried away in itself, leaves spoof land and invisibly attempts to raise it's own stakes. Suddenly you are expected to care for these characters that have been presented as stereotypes. I mean, take it somewhat seriously. This is in particular strange; Nicholas Cage is being hysterically good as a daddy training him and his ten year old girl to become superheroes. Are they any good? Uh-huh. The kid is the movie's real showstopper. This is the first ten year old you've seen that can cut a head open whilst emptying up humanity's worst vocabulary along with the ammo of her automatic weapon. Cage is also all dressed up with. An. Adam West. Imp. Ression. That is. Quite amusing. In... Deed?But there comes a time when the movie wants me to simply buy these characters emotionally and somewhat realistically. I buy them as jokes, as parodies, as an outrageous bloody comedy. But do I have to consider that this would be an actual kid and that this would be her actual dad? Am I suppose to believe this fairly far-fetched idea of a local superhero getting famous over the Internet? And why should I care? And if this plot is worth actually devoting your serious interest in, why does it start off like some kind of realistically laid out spoof? Kick- Ass begins with a world that makes a deal of how real it is, life's dull and normal circumstances and how a self-made superhero gets stabbed in the guts. But it all ends up with dodging bullets and flying in jet-packs anyway. I did enjoy the first part of the movie, it was basically a very amusing take on the superhero genre which is getting pretty tiring by now anyhow. But the most ironic thing about Kick-Ass is that despite the visual costume, it turns out it really is just another superhero movie. It really offers zip to the genre. It wants more than anything else to be what it is making fun of. The plot is intended to be taken seriously, until it stops and makes fun of itself, then continues, then stops for a joke. It really does resemble a little kid dressed as a superhero, making the story up as he goes along.Now I know what you are saying, isn't this just simply a lot of fun? Oh, I'm using my brain again? This isn't a thinking man's superhero movie? I should just shut up and enjoy the violence? Well, I don't know, that is something I cannot do. It's been a long time since I was impressed solely by bright flashy things and a lot of blood and guts. I might be getting too old for this bleep.",4,38,79,9 April 2010
The Hurt Locker," Real life Rambos need more questions to answer (and screw accuracy)
","When The Hurt Locker won the Oscar for Best Film, Directing and Screenplay, a lot of people were surprised. Not that it wasn't a hot candidate, but certain critics and others in-the-know didn't see it coming anyway. It seemed, a critic wrote somewhere, as if the jury of the Academy suddenly voted from their hearts, giving the Oscar to a low budget (in fact, in Oscar terms, record-breakingly low budget) film instead of what the industry begged for (that is to say Avatar). The choice of The Hurt Locker seemed somewhat more honest, more daring, more true to the quality of cinema.I'd have to object, your honor. That would have been true if they'd given it to Precious. Or, in another way, even Inglourious Basterds. The Hurt Locker surely is a meager looking winner of 6 Oscars, but there's really more than enough Academy material in it. It's a war movie. It's about an imperfect man trying to do good and facing the confusion when this doesn't properly work out. In continuation, it's about America doing the same thing in Iraq. It doesn't take sides. It asks questions in a moderately wise fashion. It's a little teary and it's a little amusing when it's not serious or Speech Time-ish. I'm not putting this down, though. Just saying.The main character of the film is Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner) who attends Delta Company in Iraq. His job is to defuse bombs, which is something he does, one must assume, better than anybody else. He is very reckless and Gung Ho, and not what you'd call immediately likable. He is so focused on disarming his bombs he doesn't seem to understand or care that there's people around him and that they are all in life threatening danger. His first day on the job earns him a punch in the face from his second sergeant. As the film progresses, we begin to understand that he is one of those self made war machines who cannot function in the real world any longer and thus comes to live for fighting in the frontier. He's not John Rambo, a character with the same problem, but I suspect he might think he is. Some of the best bits of the film involves scenes where he loses his illusions about war heroism. As one might imagine, they have a lot to do with children.The Hurt Locker is a good film, but I must admit I'm surprised at how easily impressed the critics have been with it. The good things are easy to point out - It is professional and well made, exactly the type of proper job Kathryn Bieglow has been known for in the past, and it is well acted - Jeremy Renner does as much as can be done with this character I believe, and Anthony Mackie balances him with a counter-role as Sanborn, the other sergeant. The best scenes involve them speaking in a realistic fashion. I know nothing of warfare, but as far as I know this is how people talk in real life no matter where. I really liked just about every scene they shared that didn't have any guns in it.The 'bad' stuff isn't really bad as much as it's 'not good enough'. Most of the content of the film is old fashioned war clichés - the good man in the bad land, slightly psychotic commanding officers, naive well- educated peacemakers, the hero who befriends the child, the could-be- innocent could-be-evil arab who wanders up when he's told to step back, basically the Cowboys and the Indians. However, I'm pretty sure that Biegelow and screenwriter Mark Boal knows about this too. I could be wrong of course, but the point of our main hero's escapades into the civilian Iraquee crowds to somehow attempting to find the 'bad guys' vigilante style, seems self-aware, rather than honest. But the film never really gets high enough, though. It has about three or four really good and memorable big moments, but in between there's not a clear focus on what this film really is about. My guess is that Boal and Biegelow didn't want to go over the line of a kind of journalistic line of objectiveness, but it wouldn't have hurt if they did. I find it a pity that a film that's obviously very intelligent won't go even further in it's own questions.I can understand most of the criticism The Hurt Locker has received, apart from one thing and that's the pointless rants about inaccuracy. This is in general a critique I have never understood, and when it comes to war films I knew from the moment I saw The Deer Hunter and experienced the tremendous impact that film had on me, that it was a completely worthless to question if it was 'accurate' or not. Accuracy has nothing to do with it. No film is accurate. It's a film. Only our feelings for them are accurate.",7,4,10,14 April 2010
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Sparkling stupidities and bloodless chastity
","New Moon is a first base porn movie. There's no sex, but kisses in slow motion. There's no obscenities, just 'Oh. Kiss me'. The perspective is kind of 'female', that is to say that the male characters are introduced and continuously shot in slow motion. The young men in the film don't like shirts very much. If you count the number of abs in it, I'm sure you'll still be counting around the time the third Twilight movie shows up.Oh, enough jokes already. New Moon is not a good film, but I admit I did enjoy it a lot more than the first Twilight. That one left me confused and frustrated. I imagined something that had become such a phenomena should at least aspire some element of amusement. It was very un- amusing, though, since it took itself with a kind of phoney seriousness that felt speculative rather than sincere. It felt as if it assumed the audience were idiots and wouldn't care that nothing made any sense or that there was no consistency in anything that happened. It was a foggy, shining, sparkling mess of epic proportions. If you knew nothing of the novels this franchise is based on, you were left totally excluded. That is a film making crime. Not a small thing either, I consider it a big felony. It's junk food cinema that doesn't even bother to give you a list of ingredients.That being said, New Moon was an easier burger to swallow. A lot of the inconsistencies of the first one applies here too - the characters act contradictory, you often have to guess what is actually going on in the plot and sometimes the film takes for granted that you won't ask basic questions of logic. There's this whole bit about the Vatican for instance, that is like taken out of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I went 'What am I even watching?'. Pattison's hunky sparkling vampire decides he wants to tell the world he's a vampire. His plan is to strip nude and walk out into the sunshine in the middle of the crowds around the Vatican. Right.... because then he'll sparkle, right? And.... then everybody will understand he's a vampire.... Hum hum....Most of the movie is nothing more than a teenage melodrama, though, and for about half of the movie I did follow along before it, well, continued and went on, and went on some more and, yawn, kept going. In any case, at least I wasn't constantly annoyed as in the first one. Teen soap opera is after all less ambitious than fantasy adventure so when it's silly, dumb and inconsistent it's easier to just take it for amusement. The story involves poor Bella being dumped by hunky Edward and instead befriending Jacob, who transforms into a CGI werewolf when he gets upset. We don't really get to know much of what she's up to, her heart is broken and she is confused and perhaps suicidal but maybe only destructive. I'll get to this in a while, but in the peachy world where Twilight takes place, 'destructive' means riding motorcycles with strangers (scary!) and jumping into the water from cliffs (nooo!). What, not even a single cigarette? Oh no, that would have been Way Too Destructive! We'd NEVER forgive THAT! Anyway, she might be going a little crazy too, because Edward is at times appearing like some kind of Obi-Wan Cullenobi exclaiming 'Bella! No!' or 'Bella! Do this!' or 'Bella! Don't do that!'. This isn't really explained further. It doesn't really matter either. The point of New Moon is really just to exhilarate it's target audience. I get it now. It's bad, but at least it's not totally inept film making, which the first film was.I could have recommended New Moon for all future teenage audiences to come. But what's really ugly about it is the poorly hidden, church like conservative, 7th Heaven kind of message that goes with it. To put it simply, New Moon is really about two peachy, healthy, heteronormative teenagers who wants to have sex for the first time but need to get married first. I know this sounds far out for some innocents, but you listen to the dialog and you tell me I'm wrong. Edward is the male patriarch, he can do as he please with Bella, leaving her here, leaving her there, she will patiently suffer with about as much independence as a child left behind by her parents. Her destiny is to be his conveniently obedient wife slave. The werewolf character is not a threat to the other male patriarch either, because he is so obviously supposed to be the homosexual monster in the outskirts of the normal world. His werewolf friend tease him for having 'a girlfriend!' and there's even infamous lines like 'Can't you find a way to just... stop? I mean it's... wrong' and 'It's not a lifestyle choice, Bella, I was born this way, I can't help it' and Bella's slightly disgusted reply 'It's not who you.... aaare, it's what you... dooo!' I could pass it off with a laugh, and I do, but at the end of it these are not the kind of vampires and warewolfs I want kids to relate to. I think Bella is a charmless idiot. I like what warewolfs do. And for the record, Edward isn't all that hot anyway.",4,5,7,15 April 2010
The Evil Dead," I loved it!
","Where I come from, ''The Evil Dead'' is hard to find. So, it was clever luck that I happened to see the uncut version with a friend at my place. You can say what you want about cinema-art but I really liked this movie. It was so simple made, but it got so exciting and entertaining. The cheap (no offense Sam, this is a minimum-budget movie) special effects are a tribute, cause the better the effects in a horrormovie are, the worse the movie itself get. **Minor spoiler** In the end of the movie, when the dawn raises you feel calmed, since Bruce is safe now when the sun is up. That is why you get even more horrofied when something runs up at him from behind. **End of spoiler, keep reading** The movie is very caotic, but realistic enough to think that it is scary. I should have seen it late at night, and I'm still sorry for seeing it 16.00 pm. But I can imagine seeing it at the night!                              Classic! 8/10",8,1,2,16 April 2000
Saw II," Insanely stupid
","The 'torture porn' horror films of the latest decade, leave me (a lifetime horror buff) divided. One the one hand, it's nice that young filmmakers who've grown up with good old hardcore horror films from the 70's and 80's, such as EVIL DEAD and Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE, get to make films in that vein after a 90's of slasher-yawners. But also, new and fresh films have to feel fresh and new. Films like THE DESCEND and HOSTEL - for instance - are stealing the ideas, rather than just letting them be elegant homage elements. Another strange thing is that these filmmakers seem to have bought the hype that throughout the years have grown in the following of these cult classics. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre simply had a point and an idea, and wasn't nearly as gruesome as the scandalously bad 2003 remake.The SAW franchise is probably the most popular example of torture porn, and in the second film the concept reaches a peak: This really is a porno film. The gore comes off in violence and not sex, but it follows the rules of a porno, first and foremost: Don't mind the story. I was no big fan of the first Saw. I liked the first 20 minutes, but the cop story was laughably amateur (the script was obviously written by two kids who desperately wanted to be cops, but had nothing but their juvenile imagination to go on) and the ending was disturbing...ly crappy. So it's safe to say, I didn't expect much from SAW II. But come on, I didn't expect it to be surpassed by SCARY MOVIE 4.This film is money-hungry crap. Everything (I mean EVERYTHING) that happens in this film is either totally unlikely, or at best merely questionable when it comes to realism. The 'Jigsaw' killer, the actual hero of these films (the only one who succeeds in them, anyway), is in this one brought out in broad daylight - and turns out to be this gray old Hannibal Lecter wannabe. The idea, I guess, is that his intellectual cool will be scary but honestly, this guy is full of it! In comparison, Hannibal Lecter was frightening due to the logic in his reasoning. This guy have no real arguments for doing what he does, the ones presented are incoherent and stupid, and comes off like a phony character without substance, only done for cheap scares. Meanwhile, the kids in the house make one unlikely move after another, and make sure to do their best to become butchered. The film is unlikely, therefore impossible to be engaged in - it's just a bunch of so-so actors running around killing each other off, following an insanely stupid screenplay. The reasoning must have been: Who cares about logic, if people simply want their money's worth in blood?This is a film so geekily eager to chop up 'chock'-violence, it never takes the time to even try to be a good film. It is sad and it is pathetic. Oh yes, there will be blood - just don't expect ANYTHING else.PS.About the guys imagining cop life while writing the screenplay, the same goes in Saw II for SWAT-teams. This is the kind of film where a SWAT-unit sees an elaborate trap and, without one moment of afterthought, walk right into it. Just one of many laughable examples.",3,1,1,31 May 2007
2001: A Space Odyssey," One of Kubrick's best movies ever.
","I have a cousin who saw this movie once. His reaction was... awful! He thought it was the worst movie he'd ever seen in his life. I wasn't surprised a bit, since I knew I understood it, and I knew that it was movie making at it's purest form.                               Stanley Kubrick is my favorite director and this movie is one of the main reasons. Because, let's face it, there isn't a film that's quite like 2001. Not in the sci-fi genre or anywhere else.                               When I sit down to watch this movie, I never try to understand it or take it that serious. I just let it pass. I'll just let it go on, and I see the movie just because the pleasure of it. The pleasure of seeing something that beats everyone else, when it comes to being original.
                              This is a milestone in moviemaking and I have forever respect for Kubrick, for bringing this movie in my life. Let 2001 forever let us know how empty the space really is.                              9/10",10,1,3,5 June 2000
Singin' in the Rain," Make 'em laugh! Makes us laugh? What could be more perfect?

What more do one need?                              I've never really made a request in a comment before, but here I felt that I had to bring it out. To anybody who's reading this: See This Movie! One of our times greatest masterpieces, and if it doesn't makes you smile, I guess a frozen chicken must have a warmer heart than you. Don't forget Hagen as superbimbo Lina Lamont!

Taken," blam blam pow pow i wish liam neeson were my daddy too
","**CONTAINS NO MORE SPOILERS THAN IN A MAGAZINE REVIEW, BUT THEN AGAIN IF YOU'RE SENSITIVE, DON'T READ**After listening in his cell phone, to the sound of his seventeen year old daughter being dragged away and brutally kidnapped by unknown brutes, the former Special Forces Agent Ryan (Liam Neeson) quietly waits until somebody picks up the phone. Then he says: 'I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.'A few quiet seconds pass before a voice in the other end replies: 'Good luck' If this sounds exciting to you, it's just the beginning. TAKEN is one of those rare gems in it's genre, a simple and wonderfully well crafted action movie where Liam Neeson plays previously mentioned ex-spy; a mediocre and somewhat pitiful man that while spending a career for his country, has been neglecting his family. Now, when the marriage is broken and the daughter already is seventeen, he bravely attempts good fatherhood, even though he barely knows who his daughter is these days, and even though the ex-wife hates him and has re-married with a rich square, who buys the daughter a horse as a sweet seventeen-gift.The whole shabang gets rolling when our anti-hero is forced to agree to his daughter going for a trip overseas to Paris with her best friend - even though Daddy (through paranoia, or supernatural knowledge about the future) sense trouble. The minute she sets foot in Paris she is abducted by horrible villains connected to the trafficking industry - and our friend Liam has to give up what he's bad at, buying birthday gifts, and start doing what he does best - knock off bad guys.Because, after that there's just one direction and that is full throttle, dead ahead. The revenge/rescue-action blows high in the sky - Neeson is undeniably great as a well dressed Rambo when he in one white knuckle sequence after another tracks down the big shot's bigger shot's biggest shot's even bigger shot, passing all limits of rage to stack up the bad guys in a body pile and bring back his daughter.Luc Besson had a finger in the screenplay, and you can tell. For one thing, the setup is beautifully done for it's genre, that James Cameron-ish formula where you as quick as possible set up the score (which takes about fifteen minutes) and then hit the pedal to the floor. But there is a human edge to the story too, many people have had complaints about the 'boring first part' of the movie, but it serves a point. Neeson gets time enough to make a nice and believable portrait in the beginning, and that is why we like him through the rest of the movie, and that is also why we totally agree that his every act of violence is, well, 'justified'.Apart from that, there's no need to think too much in this movie - one great hold-on-to-your-adrenalin-scene follows another, it's the dark knight on a vendetta, bourne with balls, james bond not with a vodka martini but with a big damn scotch on the rocks - and when the 90 minutes suddenly have passed, you get that feeling you get when the roller-coaster ride has stopped - already over? Better get back in line, I mean jeez, we just have to do this one more time.No action fan alive can miss this film. There is one line in particular that concludes the experience: '.....We can nego'BOOM",7,1,4,8 November 2008
Toy Story 2," The best animated film ever
","**Warning for minor spoilers and spelling mistakes**                              I didn't really liked the first Toy Story-movie (when I first saw it, I resaw it yesterday and now I think it's quite great). Everybody said that it was great, but I thought that the movie missed a spirit. It was only a show. A wide production of breathtaking animations. And, sure, the animation was impressive, but we have to review movies for what they are, right?                              Therefore, the sequel surprised me like no other movie.                              Toy Story 2 mixes some usual children's humour, most of it in the beginning, and ''real'' laughs, making it charming and entertaining like no other movie. At least not for kids.                              The story seems simple, but still gets quite genious. People should not avoid this film, just because the animation. Lately, the animated movie has grown, to more adult-fitting. Not much, Toy Story 2 for example is not really an adult movie, but still some ingredients in ''Prince of Egypt'' and ''Antz''. Toy Story 2 is a movie for all ages. Really!                              The characters are entertaining and no one is annoying. Some of the highlights (they are many) is definitely the encounter with Buzz Lightyear and another Buzz-action hero who really think he is a space hero, the car stop at the Barbie-section and the great ending scene at the airport. Like other sequels to movies like ''Home Alone'' and ''Austin Powers'' this sequel is not a remake of the original, where all the jokes has been easily uppdated and refreshed. Every lack the first movie had has been smoothely fixed up and the movie has a heart, wich, in my opinion, the original missed.                              The adventure in the movie is a whole lot more entertaining than before, and it is a whole lot funnier than ''Toy Story''. Both the opening scene, the incounter with Woody and his round up-gang and the rescue-patrol is highly enjoyable. Quite a little masterpiece.                              My rating: 9/10",Null,0,1,19 April 2000
Up," A movie about old age and young hearts
","Walt Disney once said that he wanted to make movies for audiences, not just kids. His goal was to produce animated film equal to live action features, movies that were seen and appreciated just like any other movies. One can certainly discuss how well the Disney studio has taken care of this legacy, but the company that kept the innovation going for it has obviously been Pixar. Step by step, movie by movie, the people at Pixar have kept outdoing themselves. To me, Wall-E was them crossing the final frontier, breaking their own roof and kept going towards the stars. That wasn't just a family adventure and it wasn't a kids movie. It was about two machines and the entire human race - a movie for audiences, don't you think?Up is a companion piece on the same level. It's not about the entire human race, but it's about the entire life of a human being - this is a movie that tries to learn very young people a little something about very old people. In the beginning of the movie we meet Carl, a little toddler with stars in his eyes, dreaming about going out into the world for adventure. Coming home from a Newsreel concerning his biggest adventurer hero, he passes a house where adventurous things seem to be in full motion. Thus, he meets Ellie, a happy gal with equally grand dreams as himself. Now, in any other animated movie this would be our two main characters, kids on the screen for kids in the theater to relate to. But what follows is a montage, spawning decades, and upon the end of this montage we meet our main protagonist - it's Carl alright, but now he's Mr. Fredricksen, a cranky old man. The movie has just outrun the eight year olds by 70 years or so! Hey little Charlie, this is your life Mr. Fredricksen. It's dangerously brilliant.Our cranky old hero has a warm and colorful life behind him, but he never got to go out on any of those adventures. While there's still time, and while there's certainly nothing better to do, Carl figure it's time for some adventure so he flies away in his house toward South America, the land of his dreams. His only baggage is Russell, the real kid for the kids in the audience to 'relate' to. Carl finds him obnoxious and even though Russell is your average modern eight year old, I guess the real modern eight year olds in the movie house should understand why by now. Back in the days, all Carl and Ellie knew about South America was that it was 'America, only south'. Russell takes GPS for granted and says 'You're going to South America? You know, most people take a plane, but you're smart because you'll have all your TV and clocks and stuff.' Russell doesn't seem to have any pure, authentic dreams of adventure in him, and he's certainly not that imaginative, but he does like chocolate.What follows is an adventure as old fashioned as it is fun and original. There's something very classical about the whole fair; an amazing flying machine that has to be repaired somehow, strange dangers in the jungle and giant zeppelins with the insides of luxurious steamboats. In a sense, this is also an adventure movie about adventure movies - it's part of the adventure to explore jungles, discover strange animals and exciting secrets. Carl knew this when he was eight but now, almost eighty, it's all just a nuisance. He is totally uninterested in whatever they discover. 'Can we keep it?' Russell says. 'No' Carl keeps replying and continues to limp along. 'But it's a talking dog!!' Russell finally exclaims.Up also has fairy tale touch to it that is woven into the visual dynamic. It feels as if it's taken inspiration both from the films of Miyazaki, and from that elegant French style of animation that borders to realism. The adventure is strange enough to make you fall back into escapism, but at the same time it's all very close to heart. Carl Fredricksen is as believable as Walter Matthau or Jack Lemmon were in Grumpy Old Men. Up seems to salute these kind of cranky old men too, it seems to give an homage to this soon extinct generation of analog, post- war dream weaving. It also seems to be wanting to tell the kids of today that you should really try and be nice to cranky old men, because being one is not the easiest thing in the world. Another thing the movie seems to be telling us is that no matter how lonely and bittersweet life can be when you're at the end of your days, we are all children at heart.",8,2,3,6 March 2010
A Clockwork Orange," Definitely Kubrick's best movie.
","31 march 2000This movie is amazing. One of the best movies I have ever seen.Violent, gross, strong, powerful, and the most uncomfortable movie in the world. McDowall as the Beethoven-loving hooligan-leader is perfect and disgusting, when he and his pack of 'droogs' is going around and rape, kills and as he says commiting 'ultra-violence'. His mates sets him up, he gets brainwashed and is thrown back in the society as a new person. But is he? And how does the world treat him nowadays?This movie is VERY disturbing. It's so tragic and powerful.Just the feeling you get when the droogs rings the bell on mr.Alexander's door. You don't feel safe in your house anymore. I don't think I could sleep for a week after seeing this movie. Actually, I kind of hide it. I have seen it two times, maybe three, no more. The main reason is... I don't dare. It isn't just a movie you slack upon a Sunday morning. Just as in other Kubrick movies you will have to be ready for something different. 2001 (you can't say I'm wrong), DR. STRANGELOVE (verrryyy bizarre), Barry Lyndon (is there a longer movie?), The Shining (it IS scary!!!) and Full Metal Jacket (about the same as this one). I haven't seen EYES WIDE SHUT yet, but I will be prepared.I love Stanley Kubrick, he is my nr.1-director (even though he's dead) and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is his best movie ever made.The scariest movie in the world. 10/10",10,1,2,5 June 2000
Reservoir Dogs," Perfect movie. One of the greatest.
","Even though 'Pulp Fiction' is quite better, 'Reservoir Dogs' tops most movies. Although the acting is so chemical, under it you can see that the team really enjoys to working together. Their teamwork is the main attraction to the movie. But, good acting is not really a savior. The directing, debuting Tarantino, and script, also QT, is what people will refer to as 'the old fashion Tarantino-style'. The movie is soaked up with blood. It is horrible, as in explicit content, but still, in a way cool and quite funny (if you can look closer?).                              This is simply a gangster movie that is out of the ordernal. 'Reservoir Dogs' doesn't get predictable, from the fact that the story has been rollercoastered around and the scenes are all in a great mess. But that is also a main attraction. I love this movie, because it has got a hidden meaning deep under the very intensive pulse of this gangster-classic.                              Harvey Keitel and co starring Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Lawrence Tierney, Quentin Tarantino and Edward Bunker as the gangsters they would stick up on (nah, not really, but, kind of) are fantastic titles and brings this cult-movie up even higher, as I've said.                              The absolutely gross torture-scene (Michael Madsen, Kirk Baltz) should nobody miss. It's a classic.                              Rating: 9/10",7,1,3,19 April 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," The final chapter...
","Stanley Kubrick's final hours of movie making, is here I'm afraid. And when the ending credits roll for the last time signed Stanley Kubrick, you feel abandoned from magical moments in your life.
                              EYES WIDE SHUT shines Kubrick. All the way through you feel that this is his work. This has also got all the usual things from the loved director. The script is as usual a little bid odd, there are at least a couple of controversial scenes, it's long, and the ending is perfectly surprisingly.                              The set and score are notable. The acting is great, and different when you know that Cruise and Kidman really are married. Also a number of different side-figures. Even though the long running time, the movie never bores, the desperation of Tom Cruise is something I'll always remember.                              Compared to the old classics, EYES WIDE SHUT is not quite as amazing, but it's still a very good movie, signed perfection, that is Stanley Kubrick, another very worthy part in the line of movies Kubrick has made.                              8/10",10,0,1,16 April 2000
Pulp Fiction," Genius, definitely one of the best movies ever made
","PULP FICTION is a masterpiece from start to finish. A couple of hard boiled stories, are waved together by only such perfection as Tarantino.Now, I'm not going to say that Big Q is my favorite director, but there is no doubt that the man is a genius. Just look at the script! And, just as in his other masterpiece RESERVOIR DOGS, the scenes and scenarios are harshly mixed up in one big mess. As a director, well, he's good but not that very original, with some exceptions like the PULP-dancesceen and the ending in DOGS. His real magnificent lies in this adrenalin rush script. It is genius!!!PULP FICTION is my second favorite after STAR WARS (I'm not sure why I love that film, but hey, sue me) and it can't be compared to the rest of my top-movies, nor Tarantino's others. FROM DUSK TILL DAWN is a big flat joke to this, also NATURAL BORN KILLERS (Tarantino's story) and probably TRUE ROMANCE too. JACKIE BROWN is a good film, but it's one million floors down from this movie. The nearest so far is RESERVOIR DOGS. The direction of DOGS was better than PULP, but PULP FICTION has got this screenplay that no other (and I do mean NOT ONE) has got.Let's go on to... acting. Well, I'll put it like this: A majority of the actors do their best roles ever, here is my PULP FICTION ACTING-GUIDE: TRAVOLTA: Definitely his best role so far. His portrait of VINCE is a classic. It's cool, funny and you just smile by satisfaction while he slither around mrs.Wallace's house. And the dancing-scene is also notable. Here we see that Travolta's dancing king age is still not over.JACKSON: It's a hard choice, but I'm pretty certain that this is his best performance I've seen. He's around everywhere, so it's tough but he tops. Still, it's easier concidering the fact that his performance is THE BEST IN THE MOVIE! The path of the ritcheus man is to be set on all sides... THURMAN: I have never been such a tremendous fan of Uma Thurman, but this time wer'e talking COOL CHICK. It is a shame that she's only in like 1/5 of the movie. We should see more of her. KEITEL: No, mr.Wolf isn't his best. I'm rooting for mr.White or the priest in FROM DUSK TILL DAWN. I know, it's a crap movie but the role is good. ROTH: Yeah, mr.Orange is better, but this one is on a good 2'nd place. RHAMES: His best role! Without a doubt. MARCELLUS WALLACE wer'e talking respect here. I'M GONNA GET MEDEVIL ON YOUR ASS!!!!!! He is one tough bastard. His scene with Willis was great, and every other scene he was into in this great, great movie. ARQUETTE: She isn't in this movie that much, but it is by far her best performance. STOLTZ: Eric Stoltz is a great actor, and I think every part he ever played is the best, and I'm sorry that he's not in this one that much. WILLIS: Bruce Willis might do his best performance, and the most quality-role but I have a very hard time if I'll ever try to forget JOHN McCLANE. This is his second best role.Well, let's not forget about ERIC ROBERTS and QUENTIN TARANTINO. Or should we? Yes, actually but let's try to focus on these two gentlemens too. Ok Roberts, everybody's hate victim and the biggest C-actor since DOLPH LUNDGREN. And Tarantino might be a groovy director/writor but he actually is quite pale as an actor.PULP FICTION has also got BLOOD and VIOLENCE. It is a strong, foulmouth and shocking but also classic movie. If you really loved RESERVOIR DOGS... WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??? I can guarantee (yes, I can make out a promise, sue me if this is wrong) that you'll at least like this movie.ALSO: Great sound and cool soundtrack. I first saw this movie four years ago, and it is still just as great.Overall 10/10",10,1,2,5 June 2000
The Da Vinci Code," About as mediocre as they say
","I have said it before and I have to say it again: 'True-to-the-book-Adaptations' kill potentially good films. Why filmmakers, or film goers for that matter, has not seen the genius of Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING when it comes to adapting a book, is strange. Why hasn't film yet tried to break free from it's artistically inferior position and stopped slaving behind The Novel. Film is a visual medium. The Novel is, most of the time, not. THE DA VINCI CODE is another example of a bad film that had every potential to be good.Of course, I couldn't read the book. I found it to be a case of ridiculously poor writing with silly cliffhangers at the end of literary every chapter. I threw it away after four chapters with a feeling of being humiliated as a reader. I had, to say the least, low expectations of the film. Then again, a good opportunity to be open minded.But the film *was* bad. The main reason is the bad craftsmanship, something that I was truly surprised about. I figured Ron Howard was competent enough to make a Hollywood thriller (RANSOM is underrated) but here we have a Tom Hanks for five minutes, suddenly accused for murder, then an Audrey Tatou hops on the bandwagon - everybody is acting very excited; but the excitement has not been built up, nor has the characters. The result: I don't care about them or their situation. I don't even buy it. And then follows 2.5 hours of not caring or buying, in a plot that constantly is fairly predictable and filled with used tricks. Some defenders have called this a 'thinking man's movie'. How difficult is it to follow a film that is explanatory beyond the ridiculous; - Unless the letters aren't in it's right place... - An ANAGRAM! - An anagram! Come on...And then of course, the whole 'respect for the book'-idea kills off the film even more. The film is EXTREMELY talky and UNBEARABLY long. That could be good book material. Can we all agree that it is not good film material? Where is the suspense? Where is the excitement? Nowhere of course, since the filmmakers have been too busy reading the book to be thinking of making a good film. This could have been a tight, sweaty two hour cat-and-mouse-film. It could have been anything. It's a filmed book, with the book's 'fill the characters up with your imagination'-characters, filler sequences that give coherence to the novel's story (but is dragging the FILM along) and it's 'take your time'-ending. This film never ends. It goes on forever, until every drop of the mystery is solved. The mystery that we figured out all about 2 hours ago.",4,0,2,5 June 2006
Titanic," This is Hollywood at it's top
","I'm not really sure why so many people hated this movie, but I've got a few theories:1. Leonardo DiCaprio (I can agree, but he wasn't that bad)2. Jealousy against Leonardo DiCapro (Guys, c'mon, admit it)3. It was a drama (some teenager probably hated it just because it was a lovestory, I know a few)4. They don't want to get swallowed by the hype5. They're against Hollywood6. They can't stand too long moviesOr maybe it's the classic one: They hate it, just because everybody else did it.Well, here's my comment (and I am a guy, and I'm not fag):Finally a big bang here from Hollywood. A 3 hour epic with remarkable special effects. Another example is BEN-HUR, hey same amount of Oscars!!Well now. I first saw this movie, when it came and I was amazed! I mean, wow! It was entertaining, thrilling and even though you knew the plot and storyline (the ship will sink, hope THATS not a spoiler) you were kept at your seat, because you didn't want to miss a thing, and you just had to find out what was going to happen. And what about this crankiness against the script. It is a classic setup. Three acts (the story actually stops at about every hour so I'm not that out of here) , the beginning with the proud ship and the glorious ''first class' and some character-presentations, the middle where the ship hits the ice and the worrying starts while some characters gets developed, and the final act wich is an hour of thrilling action and glorious special effects! I have NEVER IN MY LIFE witness such a simple but so genius storyline! And I can't understand those who wasn't impressed.OK, the acting might not be as great as it maybe should. DiCaprio is the obvious choose to get money, but he's not the right kid, and the worst part is HE FIT'S IN (might sound a bit strange). Winslet was good, but BILLY ZANE was the best! I just loved that character. I ''almost'' laughed in every scene in he was in. James Cameron here shows that he can make any genre (but the action is his top), and of course Bill Paxton hangs along too.This might not be THE BEST movie ever made, but it is definitively one of my semi-finalists! 9/10",8,2,4,17 May 2000
The Happening," By far, the most underrated movie of 2008
","Here's my pick for the most underrated movie of 2008. And man, sometimes you wish you were just like everybody else and didn't have to be in this uncomfortable minority - everybody hates this movie, and everybody hates M. Night Shyamalan. That's too bad. I don't really know why. The Happening is quite great.The story is brilliantly in your face - all of a sudden, everybody in Central Park, NY, inexplicably commits suicide. Then all over Manhattan this mass event follows - construction workers walks out from shaffolds for no apparent reason. As it turns out, this 'toxin' as it is called in the movie, spreads throughout the entire East Coast. Why only the East Coast? We don't get to know, we can only speculate (on the same level as the characters, no less) and this is an example of how the movie takes a quite original standpoint. Mark Wahlberg plays a Philadelphia high school science teacher who has to escape along with his wife (Zooey Deschanel), his co-worker and best friend (John Leguizamo) and this man's daughter (Ashlyn Sanchez) - there is clearly something from the past going on between them that we never get to understand, another example of how the movie refuses to explain itself. As it turns out, the directions are few since dead bodies are found by virtually every exit. Wahlberg's character has to do his best to try to get some sense out of the strange events that happens - he has no answers and he has no good plan on how to survive because he's just a human, but by using scientific logic he can conjure up a theory that may or may not be true, but that at least works in order to keep them alive.It has been a while since I sat through a film that allowed me to breathe and take in what's going on for myself, with obligatory afterthought and a demand of some constant brain activity. Every scene in the film is thematically a question that has no answer, but inspires speculation. I have a theory as to why this film was received so poorly. M. Night Shyamalan is well known for his seemingly natural talent of creating spooky, supernational darkness. Now, the critics are right - nothing in particular happens in this movie. But this is not an action movie. The dark, Shyamalanesquemoodiness was probably taken to it's extreme in the mediocre The Village (2004) and I find it interesting that he can break free from the spook house - or well, judging by the negative response he can't, but I admire him for trying.And he doesn't make it all easy on himself either. Had he been interested in gaining back his reputation he could have easily made this into a creepy, apocalyptic doomsday-film where Mother Earth Strikes Back and the very nature itself becomes a threat, forcing everybody to stay indoors. Yeah, he could have made a crowdplaser. But, and I think this is the most important thing about the movie and why people don't like it, This is not a horror movie. It's barely a thriller. It's a science-fiction movie, first and foremost. We are not in this to be scared. We are in this to think. Consider how the movie takes place in broad daylight, how there is no suspenseful bit-by-bit-buildup as in, say, Signs (2002) and notice that there is no hints and mysteries given in stock for a surprise ending. No, the hints and mysteries this time leads us into a question mark - what happens is 'an act of nature that we will never fully understand' as Wahlberg puts it in the beginning of the movie, on another subject. I don't know what to say, I like it. I find it intelligent.True, The Happening is no masterpiece, it is flawed, at times far fetched and silly, and if it's deliberate or not, well, that's not always easy to understand. It surely bites of a little more than it can chew. But I really like it nonetheless, it was the first movie of the year that instantly made me eager to re-watch it, and I love how Shyamalan doesn't go the traditional way with it, leaving all threads open for interpretation. Sure, there's definitely an environmental message in there (duh...) but it's not taken out of the air (so to speak), and furthermore it's a study of human behavior, all characters act realistically and the film in itself even bears a naturalist air to it, and I don't know about you but I sure miss that amongst todays over-explanatory, steroid pumped thrillers.The Happening is, I would say, Shyamalan's best movie since Signs, it has gotten an unfair amount of nag and way too little praise. Personally, it gave me back my faith in him as a director that can make his own distinct movies without making them just plain repetitious. I suspect Shyamalan himself didn't expect any 'comeback' with this movie, I think he has gained is auteur title, and will keep making the films he wants to make, regardless of who will see it or what they will think of it. I, for one, will be looking out for the next one.",7,3,8,9 November 2008
The Godfather: Part III," It simply doesn't work very well
","Being an optimistic fellow I wanted to enjoy The Godfather Part III the first time I saw it - this was easy, since its a competent piece of film making, generally well paced, acted, it's coherent, Al Pacino's in it, Coppola has made this film from A to Z and on its own terms the film doesn't have any inexcusable flaws. (Not even, I might add, the notorious Sofia Coppola; she's bad, but her performance is benefited by the character she's playing, which is also weak). So for a long time I was one of those guys going 'Hey, Godfather part III isn't as bad as everyone says. Sure, its not as good as the first two but not many movies are!' Later in life, presumably with heightened standards and a better sense of criticism, I started to suspect that the opposite could be true - that part III was really nowhere near as good as I'd recall - and after seeing all three films pretty much back to back I have to be honest (an approach I think wouldn't hurt the more enthusiastic defenders of this film) and conclude that The Godfather Part III, despite certain qualities, simply doesn't work.(Excluded passage due to word limit; concerning how Coppola did the film for the money, and that it actually makes the film a little easier to appreciate)I think the film really, on a whole, is perhaps not 'bad', certainly not horrible, but definitely a failure. The plot is underdeveloped and not engaging - Michael Corleone suffers from guilt. Its not unreasonable to say he did that at the end of Part II already. Where does his search for redemption lead him? Do 'they' really pull him in again? Does his character do or say anything really memorable? Once or twice. But the script really is a long filler-session. And while everybody seems to just automatically praise Pacino because, well, he's Pacino I don't think his performance in this film is particularly good either, at least not by his merits. He's a great actor, and this is as fine a performance as any other he's made, but when you consider how truly versatile Pacino can be (compare Godfather part II with Scarface, with Serpico, Devil's Advocate, you name it, he's right there in character) its a disappointment that the aged Michael Corleone has turned into... well, Al Pacino. Obviously the character is not the same man that he used to be, but I never once really believed that I was watching Michael Corleone. He looked, and acted, too much like Al Pacino.Not to mention Andy Garcia being nothing more than Andy Garcia, Joe Pantanglio, Eli Wallach, Talia Shire in a strangely awful performance (she's not a bad actress at all, but whatever happened here?). And of course Sofia Coppola; she isn't the crucial problem, but in the end she does become responsible for a lot of misfiring. The only one still doing a prime job is Diane Keaton as Kay - truly an unsung hero in these films, and to me one of the main reasons the drama work - and the film's best scenes were the one's she shared with Pacino. Why? Because then I felt like I was even watching a Godfather movie.Much of everything else simply doesn't work. Whereas the original films were subtle and ambiguous, part III filters the story with melodramatic punches that are un-inspired and obvious. Michael's son, played by Franc D'Ambrosio, seems taken from Days of Our Lives and so many of the questions we ask ourselves - what does he remember from his childhood? What does any of the characters feel about Michael's marriage in Sicily? Did Tom Hagen ever move to Las Vegas? etc - are left completely by the road, as if Coppola truly isn't interested in telling this story. There are instead near-insulting reminders to the audience that the other two movies still exist (like the pointless scene where Michael have kept the drawing Anthony left at his pillow when he was nine or so; 'I remember this' he smiles, though I'm not sure if we are to understand this as 'I also remember they shot up the bedroom that same night'; once again, it seems Coppola simply forgets his own story). There are also awkward attempts at creating dramatic highlights in line with the horse-head scene and that very shooting in the beginning of Part II, involving a shooting during a parade in Little Italy and a stupid and ugly scene involving a helicopter. Making a Godfather sequel formulaic is truly a depressing insult to the originality of the first two films. The attempts Coppola takes on the Vatican are also pretty flat when you think about how Italian cinema has been doing this for half a century.There's no reason to watch this film have you not seen the first two. And there's really no reason to watch it if you have seen them either. When you think about it, I don't see why the film's few merits are worth talking about. Movie newbies having seen Part I and II will naturally see III too, and I think many of them will come to the same conclusion. It's not all bad, but so what. It simply doesn't work very well.",6,56,77,23 December 2011
Psycho," One of the best movies ever made!
","**Please excuse me for some spelling mistakes**                              This is the BEST HORROR/THRILLER/SCARY MOVIE IN THE WORLD! I just love this movie! Since I am a true movielover I do not mind that it is in black and white at all. The actors were great and still today it is a bit creepy when the thievish Marion Crane chooses the wrong place to spend the night on (and the wrong shower, ha ha ha). Perkins is SO perfect as Norman Bates and the voice of mother really made me shiver. The movie is filled with classic lines that I won't forget even if I'll isolate myself for 20 years. For those who can't stand old movies, or are'nt any real movielovers this will be a sleeping pill. But for us with a good taste it will be a very good experience. Don't get me wrong, i mean ''The Blair Witch project'' for example is scarier than ''Psycho'' but ''Psycho'' is creepier and better than any other thriller!                              Watch out for the remake from 1998, it really sucks!!!!!!                              10 out of 10 OF COURSE!!!!!!!!",10,8,15,19 April 2000
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Is he crazy? Well, anybody who don't like this movie IS!!!!
","This is simply if not the best, than at least one of the best movies ever. Milos Forman invites us to his movie in the credits (naturally) and at the first scene, you already then feel that this is going to be something special. And my God it was! This movie simply has got everything! Humor, Drama, tenderness, empathy, realism, evil. That's one reason I love it. The other? Well, It's once again a tale of the endless battle against good and evil, something that appeals me very much. These two things are the things that makes a movie very good (thats why STAR WARS is my nr.1, good vs. evil and has got every genre in the world).Now, Milos Forman is a very original director. I have only seen one of his movies (LARRY FLYNT) from this, and the two are similar in direction, I realize as I write this. And now it's nothing I can put my word on, but it is. Over to One Flew... It is a very tenderness tale that shows true love of life, and proves that people aren't as crazy as they look. The plot and script didn't lack, who said this? I don't think I have seen one better movie that contains this emotional love. Nothing is dull or boring. Nothing is stupid. No emotions fail. It is a movie witch includes sentimentality that doesn't blow over (that's unusual in a movie from America). Nothing is unbelievable or too amazing. Everything that happens seems realistic. All of this are thoughts born by thoughts that has been in my head ever since I saw this movie. And a 100%-realistic film, that keeps you thinking two weeks later has got to be a good film.Acting, no words to say. JACK NICHOLSON in one of his many master-portraits. He shines as McMurphy. Fletcher is his match in acting in this movie. She is cold, the true evil, McMurphy's nemesis and the enemy of anybody's life. She is a demon. Christopher Lloyd in his best role ever (the nutty professor in BACK TO THE FUTURE is close), Danny DeVito in his absolute nr.1-appearence. His role in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is simply so emotional that you laugh/cry every time he's in a scene. If you look at Scatman Crothers' here and look at him in THE SHINING. It is amazing how alike the characters are to each other.A movie that should be shown in school (at least) once a year, to get a look on life. 10/10",10,1,6,2 July 2000
Army of Darkness," Hail to the king of the one-liners
","ARMY OF DARKNESS is one cool/funny movie. In the part three-leauge it strikes out all the popular ones, ALIEN 3, LETHAL WEAPON 3, BATMAN FOREVER etc, etc... The only third movie that's better has to be SCREAM 3.Well, how good is EVIL DEAD III? Let's put it this way: It's groovier than THE EVIL DEAD and it's funnier than EVIL DEAD II. If you have seen the two first movie, and feel like watching a comedy, see ARMY OF DARKNESS!Sam Raimi directs quite ordenal, and the action sequences are actually pretty great. The script is fabolous, funny and exciting at the same time. But most of the entertainment is in Campbell. The highligts are many: Ash fighting small Ash-smurfs, Ash fighting 'Bad Ash', Ash fighting the ordenal demons, Ash fighting the book of the dead, Ash fighting the army of darkness, Ash fighting skelletons... To make a long story short Ash fights a lot. And you have to love the one-liners: 'Hail to the king, baby', 'Get a load of the 21:st century', 'Come get some'...
It is simply a great movie, well not for everybody but still very funny. Hail to Bruce and the script!7/10",Null,1,1,15 June 2000
Scream 2," Fantastic sequel!
","**Includes spoilers from Scream 1**                              I remember that I missed ''Scream 2'' when it was on the cinema, cause I thought that the first scream-movie was overrated and bad (after seeing it again I must say it is one of my best ever) so me and my friend who both are huge scream-fanatics rented this movie over a night, both very excited about this new sequel. Most of the time went to figure out who the killer was, and that was incredibly fun to speculate about.                              The story is about the same as before. A new killer is stalking new victims, well awere of the rules of sequels. Here we have some new butcher-victims to ''slice and dice'' and Craven really follows those sequel-rules. The biggest different between S2 and its original is the amount of blood. This is what you can call a ''blood-show'' where the victims are lined up to get knives stucked up here and there. In the first movie I figured out pretty soon who the killers were (or it was at least my theory all the way out), but here it was so many people to choose from and that made it fun! It is ''Cluedo'' all the way, but when the killer (or killers, maybe killress) got revealed it was a slightly bad pick. Otherwise ''Scream 2'' hits bullseye and for you who liked the first screammovie will NOT be dissapointed on the sequel.                              8/10",7,0,0,19 April 2000

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," One of the greatest Greek Tragedies of all time
","At 12.01 a.m on the 25th of May, 2005, I witnessed what could arguably be the greatest movie experience of my life. Being a child of the 'new' Star Wars, the special editions as a child followed by being 13 years old by THE PHANTOM MENACE and 16 by ATTACK OF THE CLONES and now 19, my entire teenage years had been marked with Star Wars. And I will never stop defending the new films. Never. It is a shame beyond words to endure the critique of narrow-minded 'fans' with warped minds, obsessed with an utterly impossible idea of Star Wars and angry at Lucas for the very same reasons spoiled kids hate their parents. I still to this day have no clue as to why people hated THE PHANTOM MENACE. I will always be amazed over Episode I, it is a rich and wide story with eye-popping action and deep emotional resonance. ATTACK OF THE CLONES is nothing but a war movie, thunderous and heart-stopping, not spoiled by the so called bad acting. Corny is Star Wars middle name. People have always been looking for things that aren't supposed to be there, when it comes to Lucas and Episodes I-III.But I was completely blown away with Episode III. I had been waiting my entire life for this film and it delivered with a force that was beyond my strength. The emotional power was so ingeniously launched and the plot was so unbearably tragic that I still cringe in my seat at it's most powerful moments, even though having seen the film numerous times since. Actors, dialogs and special effects are mere tools, it is in the imagery (and the score by John Williams) that the essence of Lucas and Star Wars lies; This is a space opera. A Greek tragedy, presented with such awe-inspiring beauty and force that it ends up in an utterly satisfying catharsis.The prequel films have turned Star Wars into a unique cinematic chronicle, an epic of unusually wide proportions. Apart from EMPIRE, the original trilogy was merely swashbuckling films in space (and JEDI was not inspired with Palpatine being nothing but a silly comic book villain). The prequels have given fulfillment to Star Wars and honor to all of the genius, philosophical threads that have always been there. And Episode III is arguably the best film in the series.",10,1,5,4 December 2006
Sherlock Holmes," Elementary with Downey
","In Sherlock Holmes as of 2009, under direction by Guy Ritchie, Sherlock is introduced using all his deductive skills to properly figure out how to kick a guy's ass in a matter of seconds and then proceeding to do it. For the rest of the film, Holmes is running about slightly neurotic with no sense of personal hygiene or taste. Yeah, exactly, he's played by Robert Downey Jr, you got it. Apparently there's two ways you can look at this and as far as I understand they are both valid - Robert Downey Jr is doing Sherlock Holmes more in the line of what the original Conan Doyle creation was. At the same time, Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes are two steps away from joining the X-Men or the Fantastic Four. Makes sense too, I guess. It's the 'contemporary' approach.All in all though, this cartoon version of Doyle's Sherlock is a lot of fun. Amusement is the key word, and the big reason is Robert Downey Jr who lifts the entire film up and carries it in his arms from the very beginning to the very end. No, make that to the very 'to be continued' (it's 'contemporary'). Not even Jude Law playing doctor Watson can do as much for the film as he does. The story - concerning the mysterious case of the gallow-dangling Lord Blackwood who apparently is coming back from the dead for a dastardly plot against the kingdom - only works because Downey Jr says it's worth following. The clues and the plot turns are only interesting because they happen to him. His fighting at the 19th century Fight Club and the 60's Batman style fight sequences only works because he's doing it and we only buy his deductive brilliance because he seems to believe in it himself. Even his love interest, the quite weak Rachel McAdams, works solely for the reason that he seems to be madly and problematically in love with her. In fact, toward the end when we are tempted with a sequel featuring Holmes' arch nemesis himself, I wanted to see the sequel just because Robert Downey Jr would do this one more time!The only qualitative thing that Robert Downey Jr isn't responsible of, the film leaves to Jude Law and the sub-plot concerning his Watson getting married to some woman and Holmes being jealous over it. Holmes and Watson, arguably the biggest closet couple in the history of literature, are basically a real dynamic duo here, and it's interesting how the movie doesn't make any effort in denying their relationship. Nothing specific occurs and at the same time, there are no clever jokes or hints to the audience. It's just there, which is both a surprise and a bit of a progressive move. By simply assuming their relation to begin with, nothing more needs to be said and the MPAA can rate it PG-13 for some violence and 'suggestive material'.It's easy to understand how old Holmes afficinados might treat this Sherlock Holmes with absinthe and a sad fiddle. But to be fair, it could have been so much worse and it's probably the most refreshing film Guy Ritchie has made in years. It's Sherlock Holmes with a bag of popcorn. All elementary, in it's own way.",7,1,2,26 April 2010

                              Well, let's try. It won't take long, read other comments for closer details and views. This is a fantastic unforgettable movie where a banker (Robbins) gets his life changed, when he get a double life-sentence because of the murder of his wife and her lover. The first years gets to be a pure hell, he gets harassed, and he doesn't fit in. When he meet Freeman and his pals and starts a friendly relationship the movie starts up.

Scream," Can all the people who don't like 'Scream' please stop seeing it as a horrormovie?!
","Here is a word to those who don't like SCREAM.I can agree at some points, some of the people who loved it has probably not laid an eye on the classic ones, and the scary stuff is scary for those peoples. But are you aware about that SCREAM IS A SPOOF AT THOSE MOVIES?It's a SPOOF! So why, oh why keep on comparing it to HALLOWEEN and THE EXCORCIST. HELLO???? IS THERE ANYBODY HOME???? Maybe you don't know WHY it's called 'Scream'??? Ghostface, the painting (scream), hello... Oh, and the ending might be refered as a satire on how long the killer can survive in all the movies (nobody can survive an umbrella to the heart twice)? Why do you see this as a horrormovie. I have actually seen PSYCHO, THE EXCORCIST and HALLOWEEN and all of these movies are very good films (Psycho is one of my favorite movies), but SCREAM IS FUNNY! It really is, didn't you even notice that Fred, the janitor, had Freddy Krueger's clothes? Didn't you see the fun where Jamie Kennedy shouts to himself to watch out? 
Come on... I loved SCREAM and since I'm the movie-nerd that's worse than Randy, I put this movie at nr.3 on my top-movies. SCREAM is the movie-trivia-heaven and THE ULTIMATE HORROR-SPOOF.It is a comedy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",8,0,0,13 June 2000
Scream," I mean, its so BIG!
","**Small spoilers below, small but they who have not seen the movie should still keep away for best result in the movie.
''Scream'' is huge! 'Scream' super-blockbuster! 'Scream 2' naturally mega-blockbuster! 'Scream 3' will probably be even bigger, after a while. Those who love horror (or all related genres) films have so much to thank this movie. ''Scream'' kicked up horrorfilms from the grave. Sure we've seen some real crap, but at the same time some greatness (''The Faculty'', ''The Blair Witch Project'' (I know, its not the same, but really, do you think anyone ever done it if 'Scream' never came`?)). The movie itself then. This movie is my third favorite movie of all time. Its so entertaining and funny. Except for the opening scene you can't buy any mean say that its scary anywhere, can you?Craven and Williamson have cooked up a standard slasher-film where teens get sliced up by a maniac. But now the teens are prepared (from all movies of course). The thing that makes ''Scream'' so different from the rest is that we find out about all details, compairs, and rules of scary movie, who we all know existed but never thought about. And if that wasn't enough it is funny! Craven and  Williamson makes, among much else, fun about how long the killer can survive (how many can survive two runthroughs in the heart by an umbrella?) and just look at the school-cleaner, Fred. Take a look at his clothes too. By the way, he is played by Craven! The acting is very funny (I just loved the super-stupid Dewey), the music is standard-good, but the soundtrack is great (I have it myself).Of course these slashers can't be really called as horrorfilm, so I can say that this is the best slasherfilm ever!10/10",8,0,0,19 April 2000

Casino Royale," Mainly for Flemingists
","Since the punishment is blacklisting, I'm pointing out that this review have MINOR spoilers that I wouldn't say spoil anything.I have been concerned for a little less than a year over the idea of creating a canon 007-prequel with the intent to close the series in favor of a 'new'. Being a Bond fan, and feeling that the 007 movie franchise is nothing short of a unique piece of cinema history it seems like an unnecessary move.Me and my partner did exit the theatre, saying in unison: 'Well it wasn't a BOND movie'. Having not read the book, and always thanking Cubby rather than Fleming when it comes to Bond anyway, I couldn't argue with purist 007-fans saying that this is the greatest Bond film since the 60's. These were the same people who thought Timothy Dalton did a great, genuine Bond. Nothing wrong with that, but they are simply not playing on my field. On my field, Bond DOES care about his Martinis and without an invisible car or two it just wouldn't be a satisfying day at the office. Just to make certain it's clear, it was NOT a bad film. Not in any way is this a weak and uninspired film. It is a rough-edged and gritty spy action film, powerful and intelligent with strong characters and surprises at every turn. Daniel Craig is arguably the best actor ever to portray Bond and judging by quality, Mads Mikkelsen is one of the top three or so actors to portray the villain. Eva Green is by far the most intricate and well-portrayed Bond girl. The stunt numbers are of bona-fide Bond magnitude, in short: nothing but awesome, and at least for the first half it is an action packed wonderwork of technical splendor. Now, with that out of the way I hope I didn't brake any toes on the Pro-Casino Royalers. This was definitely a worthy action thriller. But was it in my book a worthy 007-film?Well, it's an ambitious destruction of the franchise, the producers have clearly been active in their work of deciding what is to be renewed and what is to be screwed. First of all, and this is well-known by now, it is clearly a darker and more violent film than even License to Kill which seemed like the limit of where you could take that benefit of Bond's occupation. In this film necks are twisted, skulls are crashed on cracking tile walls, blood squirt from broken noses, torture is used in the most sadistic ways a Freudian can imagine and when death comes, there is no time given for final speeches. I guess this was unavoidable and to tell the truth, it didn't bother me immensely. Bond shoots, Bond scores. Secondly, the classic 007-plot that basically has been used since Dr.No has been scratched. This is more debatable. Not that I don't dig originality, but after a first action-packed hour we have one hour of...poker? Yes. As much as Thunderball was a film about diving, Casino Royale is a film about playing poker. And if you're in my shoes, this is just not very interesting. Sure, Mr. Bond excuses himself to kick some bad-guy-ass, but the main idea of the film is that of Craig and Mikkelsen trying to win a game of poker. Not only is it strange, it stretches out and enters the (first) ending of the movie. When we think we're in for a nice finale, people are still playing poker! I go, 'You are late for the settling of the scores, boys!'. The film ends quite abruptly, without any real excitement and the second ending that follows does very little for the pace of the film.Finally, we have a serious and soul-filled Bond character here, and we have a villain that is nothing but human and on top of that we have a Bond girl who can melt James' heart ála Diana Rigg. That this film dives into a downright romance story for a while is not very strange for a Bond-buff. But having it in a film with sadism and bone-breaking-violence.... it's not my bowl of soup. It becomes quite uneven and even though I appreciate the idea, it is one of the film's major flaws. Another problem, though I feel like a dork to mention it, is Daniel Craig. He is a good actor and he delivers 007 with weight. But it becomes a problem when we are to get to know a more personal Bond, and Craig keeps a massive stoneface worse than Timothy Dalton's - not to mention the ugly and near-psychotic nature of the character. Bond in this film is simply not a very nice guy and I didn't really feel like rooting for him. The same goes for the villain, while Mikkelsen is a great actor his role becomes quite bland in all it's 'normality'.No matter which way I look at it, Casino Royale, even though being a good and satisfying action picture, ends up a bit over-produced. The plot is strange and the desire to flesh up the story creates a lurch and the film eventually looses it's balance. Why both the hero and the villain are so colourless I don't know. Perhaps the reformation of Bond should have been completed over the course of two or three films, to get the balance right? If it's all worth it. Maybe it's just me, but somewhere it feels like more fun to watch the mad man in the lab getting blown away from a superhero-agent than watching two guys play poker for an hour. All in all, the future of 007 is a bit shaky in my eyes, and I guess that in the next installment, we will know for sure if this reformation has been in vain.",6,0,1,7 December 2006
The Deer Hunter," ...wow
","SPOILER ALERTJust got off THE DEER HUNTER about 20 minutes ago, I haven't seen it before and I don't really know what to say. I rented it along with three other movies, including SHINDLER'S LIST and THE PLATOON and THE DEER HUNTER striked these two out (even though 'Shindler' came pretty close).Sure, THE PLATOON, is a better war-movie but to claim that this movie is a war-movie is just a sign of stupidity and saying it's dull, sorry, I'm afraid that if you think you are some kind of movielovers I can assure you you are not. THE DEER HUNTER is a description of four friends and their life in a quiet town in Pennsylvania, before, during and after the Vietnam war. The war itself is just there, the story doesn't focus at the war. The movie focus on these four people's changes and, often heartbreaking, destenys.
People who complain over that there is a hole in between the big explosion and the concentration camp, and totally ignores the scene where Walken dies are probably people who were, or are interested in the war and want to see if it's realistic and don't care if it's emotional or not. Well (almost) the only thing this movie offers is emotions. The scene were Walken shoot himself in the head, because of the sadistic 'russian roulette' some people tastelessly called it on this page, is one of the most frightening and emotional moments of film I've ever seen in my life, no war-movie I've seen, and I've seen almost all of the known ones, has had the same effect on me like this did, and still I find the war-movie a very underrated genre.
But, as I said before, this is no war-movie. The Vietnam war is in the movie, but it's only there to change these four people's lives. It's simply if not the most heartbreaking and sad, then it's very close, movie I've ever seen. Shouldn't be seen as a war movie, shouldn't be compared with war-movies. Should be compared with SCHINDLER'S LIST, CHINATOWN, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE or ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST.

","Since I've now drawn everybody's attention to this comment, I might aswell explain it all. This was not a bad movie. But it wasn't really a that kind of masterpiece. In a horror-way it's a true piece of art, but as a movie it won't rank high up on my list. Sure, I enjoyed it's originality, and Craven's highly entertaining directing and with holy Robert Englund (ye, I know, he's swedish, but he's a classic) as mr. FREDDY KRUEGER, one of the coolest and creepiest characters in a movie. But the movie fails in being so filled with plastic acting, with the notable exception of Depp. He's always good. It's also a little bore that the same things happens all the time, and in the end it wasn't scary. Maybe I just had to high expectations.Well, It was a good movie, and in the horrogenre it's a classic. I will keep it in my film-collection, but it will just be because of the importance of it. 6.5/10",Null,0,0,25 April 2000
The Matrix," Horribly overrated
","Don't try to fool me that I didn't understand it, cause I did.And I must say, even though I wasn't at all confused by the script and plot as so many others seem to be, I don't think its a bad movie. But h**l, its not THAT good!I mean come on! I used to had no problems with this movie the first time I saw it, but I have learned to hate it, since its so EXTREMELY overrated (just having it 29 on the best movies ever is a proof).THE MATRIX is although trying really hard, but I can't even seem to be impressed by one single actionscene. In my opinion. Go see FACE/OFF or some other John Woo-movie to be stunned by action (it won't happen a lot). And it starts up with being (er, sorry trying to be) a smart sci-fi-movie, but suddenly Morpheus gets kidnapped by a team of wooden-acting-agents and it ends up like ANY OTHER bye-bye-brain actionmovie! Am I wrong? Climbing on walls, bounching off bullets, oohh... Give me a break! To be clear, I'd say like this: ''After 25 minutes we know what the matrix is, the rest of the movie is a long hyped up, action-standard, with a lot of glamour. Ehh... intelligent? NOT!I'm still confused how this movie got to be such a hit (yeah, go ahead mindless matrix-fans, laugh it all off), because the entire movie is old stuff, in a new package. The acting, with the exception of Laurence Fishbourne and perhaps little Joe too, is awful. Keanu seems tired and his entire face shines with that ''I should have listened to my mommy, and become a lawyer''-face. The rest of the cast is on the edge of average, many below.Oh, yeah, lets not forget all the martial arts. Eehh... is it only me, or are the guys who thought they were spectacular just unwilling to watch some old good Bruce Lee-films.Also, I would like to point out that this movie was NOT ORIGINAL! The main plot has been used many times before. If anyone can find something out of the ordernal, please give me a mail. Didn't think so.And has anyone of these matrix-lovers ever seen 2001? THAT'S an sci-fi movie! With effects that lives on still today! Why don't you guys check out THE MATRIX after about 33 years, it will probably be so boring that it won't be watchable, and people will wonder: How the h**l did this win 4 academy awards?Just thinking about Matrix 2, and 3 makes my blood chill. I guess my mailbox will be filled with criticism, after this, but I know how to respond, trust me...But, it still is an entertaining and fun movie, that I will never watch again in my life! My rating is 6/10 but I still hate it.",6,0,1,17 April 2000
Shall We Dance," Disqualified
","Sometimes you see movies that exemplifies just what a machine Hollywood is. Movies are rushed into becoming productions almost like exploitation films. You like dancing? Oh, we've got just the movie for you! Look at the box cover, that's Richard Gere! And isn't that smile of Jennifer Lopez' just adorable? And that's that Sarandon woman too, yes, I remember her from that death row movie whatever it was called... it won't matter that the screenplay is a parade of dangling loose ends and that the movie presents some stunning contradictions in their vacant characters, the frame will be glued together by some good acting and a lot of rumba, shot in close-ups.To conclude an even more un-original trait of the movie, it's a remake (what do you know!) to a Japanese movie which I have not seen. I wouldn't know the similarities between the two movies then, but I suspect that the original movie was consistent enough to make you understand what it was about. This 'Shall we dance' leads you astray very early on, and keeps you out of focus and end up with a happy ending which leaves you unsure about what the problems the characters had in the first place. Clearly, you are not meant to think too much when you watch this movie.Well, sorry, my bad, but I kept using my brain upon watching this movie. We are introduced to Richard Gere's character, a happily married lawyer who likes his life but, apparently, 'something's missing'. It never gets specific, but he does become interested in the beautiful face of Jennifer Lopez on the subway. It turns out that she's a dancer, working as a teacher at a night time dance class. She used to compete for real, but it went bad with a partner that was more than just a dance partner. Anyhoo, Gerie stops of the subway to check in at the dance hall and subsequently starts to hang out there frequently. He learns to dance. Is he really interested in Lopez? Maybe, maybe not. He however keeps his mouth shut to his wife, played by Susan Sarandon who eventually starts to get suspicious.Now what this movie at one level at least tries to be (I guess there was some kind of real motivation involved in the making of it) is a movie where a guy who's got it all gets intoxicated with dance because it gives him something exciting next to his satisfying but mundane life. But regardless of what the idea is, the movie starts out as a drama about adultery. The dancing is shot straight, and when the characters start to get ready for a dance contest - which is what the big showdown of the movie is supposed to be all about - it's impossible to care about any of it. The elephant in the room is Gere's marriage, and the question 'what the hell is he doing?' somehow switches to 'aw, who cares, look it's a dance contest coming up!' But I really can't imagine anybody getting a high temperature out of Gere trying to dance waltz in a series of medium close-ups. Compare it for instance to Baz Luhrmann's Strictly Ballroom. Now there was a movie all about dancing. We are led to believe that this movie is about Gere and his unspecific affection towards Lopez. Then we are to believe that it's all about the magic of dance. But there's no magic involved. It's stale and dead, and while the director is the most guilty I think a lot of the failure lies in Gere too, who is far too robotic and two dimensional of an actor to express a character like this. When he says that he got to like dancing, I'm not really getting in the mood to take classes. Lopez is another story, not just because she is a natural born dancer but also because she's an underrated actress who makes quite a believable and realistic girl next door-type of great and professional dance lover. Many other actors serving as comic relief are also good, Stanley Tucci for instance, but they are definitely by the numbers.But by far the greatest problem I had with this movie was letting Susan Sarandon play a semi-hysteric role, making the worried wife a comic relief. She becomes the visible object of the big flaw of the movie - What is it supposed to be about? Does she ever find out that her husband went to take dancing classes by following a beautiful young woman he got interested in? It's as if the movie forgets about this along with Gere's character and that's just, if not an outright shame, than at least sloppy storytelling. We don't get to know anything about how Gere's life was changed by his dancing experience. We don't get to know if the marriage is flawed, or if Lopez' character was a threat to it. Or what any of the events in the movie actually mean. It all ends up utterly pointless.As passable enjoyment I accepted this movie about one third into it before I found it totally lost it's concepts. After that it was straight downhill and I just wished somebody could have come along to clean up the script and switched the director. You know, made the same movie only better... oh, wait a minute, right, there was the Japanese original. Better check it out.",4,1,1,5 October 2009
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," It's easy to say. It's more difficult to explane: The best movie ever made
","STAR WARS and THE GODFATHER is the god of movies.                               This movie didn't really turn me into a super duper star wars fan. But I sure must admit that ''Star Wars'', ''The Empire Strikes Back'', and ''Return Of The Jedi'' ( or in another way the ''Star Wars Trilogy'' ) is by far the greatest movie(s) ever created. George Lucas rocks! The actors where good, the effects was ( in the 70:s ) incredible, and the directing very good. It's an adventure beyond everything else. And the other 2 movies were at least as perfect.                               In the ''first'' Star Wars-movie princess Leia is captured by the evil Space Empire, lead by the even more evil Darth Vader, from their gigantic space station, The Death Star. The rescuers are Luke Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi, Han Solo, C-3PO, R2-D2 and Chewie, but let's not bore you. We all know that.                              The best thing about this movie is that it combines so many kinds of genres. Star Wars is filled with action, adventure and absolutly fantastic space scenes. But in the same time the movie is human, sad and the romance is not as flat as in all the 80's action movies. The movie is also a saga. The farmerboy finds the eremite, they take help from the raw cowboy and his sidekicks, and the mission is to rescue a princess. That message was strongest in Episode IV.                               It is a classic battle between good and evil. And not in a Evil Dead-way nor in a Exorcist-way. It is the Star Wars-way. The best example of the longtime battle.                               Once again, I can't say that I'm a Star Wars-freak, but this is the greatest movie.",10,0,2,19 April 2000
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," It's easy to say. It's more difficult to explain: The best movie ever made
","The saga continues (please excuse me for some dumb spelling mistakes, they just got here)... The first Star Wars movie didn't really turn me into a deep star wars fanatic, but I must say, these three movies are my absolute favorites!                              The second (or fifth, whatever it is the same anyway) part of the trilogy, ''The Empire Strikes Back'' is just as good as all the others. At some points it is more of a direct remake of the first movie, but mostly it is new profiles and new stories to experience. I thought the rescuing of an innocent princess was magic. Boy! Here (for those who did not knew) Luke gets to the ''Dagobah-system'' to find the Jedi-master Yoda, Obi Wan's master. There he will learn to suffer hard training, and wild adventures until he finally meets the master of darkness, Darth Vader. In the same leap goes Han Solo's adventure in Lando Calrissian's city in the clouds, together with Chewie, Leia, C3PO and R2-D2. It's pure magic, and that special effects got better after three years didn't make things worse. I love these films. May them live forever!",10,0,1,13 April 2000
Aladdin," A very popular disney-classic
","**As usual tons of spelling mistakes**This is a high-listed disney of mine. It is a very wellmade and entertaining version of the tale of Aladdin. The movies greatest gift is Genie, with lovely fireworks and magic, and the voice of Robin Williams (suprisingly good voice back here also by swedish actor Dan Ekborg) Of course it got two oscars for the musical parts. Suprise me again. If you liked ''Aladdin'' as a disney-film keep away from the two sequels ''Return of Jafar'' and ''Aladdin and the fourty thieves'' (might be the wrong title, in that case all bad on me) made for video. They came up with some more glorious disney-classics but then it got worse. But ''Mulan'' came and made disney-days seem good. But wait a second, thats my Mulan-review that!",6,1,2,10 April 2000
Moon," Good science fiction does not grow on trees
","Good, serious science fiction is not really something we are fed up with. Looking back at the history of American sci-fi cinema we see a pretty meager landscape. Over the years there have been one or two signs of life. But no organism big enough to have a body, the genre is very much still an embryo. It's like the ape in Kubrick's 2001 threw the bone in the air, but nobody was there to pick it up. Therefore, this feature debut from British writer-director Duncan Jones is a movie pretty alone in it's kind, which would seem fitting given it's plot involving one man alone on the moon. Sure, we can find some hints and homages here and there. Suffice to say, if you were at all fascinated by Solaris, Alien, 2001 or Blade Runner, you will enjoy this movie. But that's also as far as it goes. One could say, if you enjoyed those movies then hurry up to catch this one because they don't come along very often. As far as movies go, quantum wise, it's lonely in space.Any admirer of this genre will approve the setup of the movie. In some close or parallel, would-be future, we energize the planet with solar energy, taken and generated from the sun to Earth, from generators located on the moon. There is one job vacancy for an administrator up there. Thus, within the large facilities we meet Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) who has been up there for three years and now has but two weeks left of his contract. He is beyond homesick, talking to himself and several plants and gazing at loved ones through video messages through cold machines. His loneliness has even driven his health to a shaky state. What was that? Am I alone in here? Probably just imagining things. Right, exactly. His only company is that of Gerty, a friendly computer moving by the ceiling, expressing his mood in smileys and carries the voice of Kevin Spacey. Gerty seems to be a very sweet and innocent baby brother of HAL 9000s but geez, everybody knows you can't trust any kind of artificial intelligence in space. The movie, exceptionally well paced from start to finish, gives you the morning (and evening) routines of Sam's and then we start the plot mechanisms when Sam has a little accident, is knocked unconscious and wakes up at the medical ward. 'How long have I been gone?' he asks Gerty's happy smiley. 'Oh, not very long' is the reply. But it looks like Sam has got some initial problems moving his legs and if you've seen Kill Bill you know enough to get suspicious. The story that follows is pretty much impossible not to follow with interest and excitement.This is a movie you can't really make much of a review of, since so much of what happens in it is for the viewer alone to find out about. But there are certain things worth mentioning. Much of the content in Moon are things that have been the subject of many science fiction movies, even campier ones, and I guess if anything holds it away from being truly great and 'merely' enjoyable it's that it moves within it's own comfort zone, not breaking any significant new grounds, specially in contrast to the perplexing heights at which real sci-fi masterpieces have gone. Perhaps this is a beginner's trade. In any case, it's a highly notable first feature. What probably struck me as the very most impressing thing in the movie though, was Sam Rockwell's one man show (or, 'one' man show if you will... or maybe one 'man' show.. nevermind, you'll get it later). It's been clear to me since a while back that he is a quality actor - variating his roles to that of alcoholic looser/hair-trigger in Snow Angels to Zaphod Beeblebrox in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy - but this time he really holds up much of the entire movie on his shoulders. Without spoiling anything, I can say he gets to use body language, psychological presence and provide action from his character facing intense and unimaginable emotional situations. I hope he feels proud of his work in it, because it certainly comes off as hard work.It's difficult not to recommend a movie like Moon. It is rare we see movies of it's kind, and for any fan of the genre it's definitely worthwhile. It's a well made, adequately thought provoking, proper science-fiction movie, it's only actual flaw being that it's not better than Solaris.",7,8,15,20 September 2009
Back to the Future," This is the most played movie at TCM...in the future!
","We are talking CHARM-CLASSIC!We are talking AMERICAN-CLASSICThis is a very good movie, I have always loved it, even though it has got a bit ruined since they show it at TV about 35 times a year. But I still love it. Michael J Fox is funny, but Christopher Lloys is even better than he was in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUUCKO'S NEST. It is a character both similar and un-similar to each other. It's a charming and original film with BIFF, the guy we love to hate (I think he's so great I can't hate him).Part II was a bit of a dissapointment, part III was very good, but this one is by far the best in the trilogy.",8,0,1,12 June 2000
The Birds," They'll never scare me the same way as with the old ones
","You can already feel it in the beginning (here comes the opening, so we'll call it a spoiler). Tippi Hayden is walking on the streets of San Fransisco, looking up at the sky, a bit worried, at a big group of black birds as old Hitch walks out from the pet shop with two dogs.The rest of the movie is a pleasure. And a terrific scare!
The suspense in this movie is one of the most mysterious ever. **I'm sorry spoilers are here again, I can't help telling some stuff.** Starting up slowly with an attack by a single seagull and crashing birds on a door in full-moon, to attacking in group like a war. God bless you, Alfred! One of my favorite movies. You almost made a PSYCHO with THE BIRDS. 10/10",Null,1,1,16 April 2000
Beetlejuice," Tim Burton's directing is so visible it's almost a cameo
","The best thing about BEETLEJUICE is without a doubt Tim Burton's directing. Tim Burton is one of the first reasons I got interested in film whatsoever. It was with BATMAN from 1989. A great, big masterpiece, if you ask me his finest piece of film. However, BEETLEJUICE, is not one of his best. But it's great, funny like few and in most aspects good, but it can't stand up to movies like EDWARD SCHISSORHANDS or BATMAN. I gave it a 7. It was great, but not 'very good'. Well, for this simple reason:When the movie starts it is funny as hell. And the first half hour a 10-pointer. But I think that after an hour it's not that funny anymore. Beetleguise is funny all the time, but Juno and the waiting room and all that is old news buy now. It's not funny anymore. The first time I saw it, I loved it. And the storyline is also a bit disappointing. It wasn't a very great idea to make the family want to make money out of them. It would be funnier if they got terrorised and had to stay. Sure, it was a more realistic way out, but I think in a movie that's about two haunting-sucking ghosts and the link to another world, with evil snakes, Junos, Beetleguises and painted doors opening, it doesn't have to be. 7/10",Null,0,1,10 July 2000
Evil Dead II," Hilarious!
","This is simply the coolest comedy ever. We are talking sequel/remake/parody on the first movie that actually is a scary movie that works as a horrormovie. Now, saying that the original THE EVIL DEAD was a comedy is a little bit wild, but it had a good mood and it didn't take itself so serious and neither did the audience. EVIL DEAD II is, to be honest, a pure comedy. Sure it has got tons of gore and blood but exactly how scary is it when poor Ash hunts his own nemesis, his own hand, around in the house with a shotgun?Not in the least. Well all we need now is a but... And yes, BUT the movie has got too many jokes mixed up with too much violence. And if you are going to mix it up with action, adventure and fantasy and then make the entire movie drowned in ink, it's always dark or even black, and oddness it gets a bit worse.6/10",Null,0,1,14 June 2000
