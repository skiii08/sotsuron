Howl's Moving Castle," Not terrible, but Miyazaki's worst.
","I honestly believe a lot of people think that if they don't enjoy a Miyazaki film they're wrong, and therefore say it's great no matter what. This film is the best example of it, I think this is easily his worst film to date. I admire the things he attempted to do to change the animation style, but I don't think all of it works, the movement of the castle, for example, I didn't really like.Basic plot: Little girl becomes old woman and moves in with a wizard in a walking castle.I've read the book, and wanted a closer adaptation. Miyazaki's Howl is not the same as the book's though he reproduces one scene from the book that doesn't really fit the Howl of the film. The story changes weren't really for the better, but the film mostly stands on its own feet. The ending doesn't work as unless you've read the book you will be unaware of certain aspects of Sophie's character.For someone who'd read the book, calcifer will be a disappointment I feel. Just too childish in the film. The added war themes are pretty clumsy compared to Porco Rosso, or Mononoko etc. but the message is still positive.I watched the Japanese subtitled version, which has English completely different to the dubbed track! Odd! The dubbed calcifer is better than the Japanese one, but the Japanese track is better in all other respects.This film shouldn't be the first Gibhli one you look into, but if you've liked others give it a try.",6,1,4,25 June 2006
