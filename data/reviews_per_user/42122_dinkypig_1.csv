The Lobster," PLEASE DON'T WASTSE YOUR TIME!
","Well, I've just wasted 2 hours and 20 minutes of my life. To describe this film as a comedy, is absurd, it was more like a cheap British horror flick. The only reason I watched this film was because of Colin Farrell, loving his performance in 'In Bruges'. 
Not one of the characters had any redeeming features, they all behave as if they're autistic, or not quite the ticket. There's no story as such, it just ambles along, and then ends. If you like weird, illogical story lines then it might be your bag, I wouldn't inflict this film on my worst enemy. What surprised me most, is the amount of high profile actors that agreed to be in it. On a positive note, the scenery was beautiful and eye catching. This film left me feeling like I'd just woken from a bad dream. Just weird, for weird sake.",1,2,3,15 February 2018
