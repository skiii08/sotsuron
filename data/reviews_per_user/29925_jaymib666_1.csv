First Man," Don't expect From the Earth to the Moon.
","So the story of Neil Armstrong from test plot to being the first man on the moon and also the story of how his wife dealt with Neil after the death of there daughter which you find out right at the start. I like it to a point, for sound and the effects are amazing when your watching the few bits that show NASA, space and the spaceships. you felt like the astronauts was put into metal cans just glue together, which is basically true, but the bits with his family and wife bored me alittle bit, i understand why but from showing the lost a their daughter and that drive him to work, just felt long. 
I still say if your looking for a drama about a wife dealing with a man who can't deal with a daughter death whule bits of man working for nasa who lands on te moon, go for ir, this is your movie, if your looking the HBO series from the late 90s from the earth to the moon, this isnt your film and that series does a much better job much of tells the story of NASA mission to the moon and all the apollo missions and it's more enjoyable to me.",6,1,2,14 October 2018
