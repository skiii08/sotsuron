Kill Bill: Vol. 2," It sucks
","I love Hong Kong Kung Fu films, I love anime, I love Tarantino's previous work, but this.. I just don't get it. It's boring, shallow.. actually it's a lot like the new Punisher film. Which also told a story about revenge.I sincerely recommend for all of you who liked this film, to see The Punisher. It is also filled with meaningless torture and violence scenes, that usually occur only in anti-hero movies. By which I mean, that the 'hero' gets his/her butt kicked in every fight.I really hope that Tarantino won't produce such a piece of crap ever again.Thank god I paid only to see the first volume.",1,7,13,9 July 2004
2012," Too long!
","I can't believe how awesome the CGI were! But them alone don't carry for 2h30min.To put it short -- the film was just too long. After an hour I was ready to give it an eight but then it just carried on and on with one of the most foreseeable and clich√©d plot I've seen in a while. After one hour and 45 minutes, I couldn't wait it to be over. But no, they just added more 'plot' fit for a children movie.I hope there's going to be a 'producer's cut' with at least 45min of non-CGI'd drama scenes cut off.Though my wive did like the movie and didn't think it was too long, so who am I to judge..",6,4,8,14 November 2009
Stardust," Excellent
","When I saw the trailer, I thought what a nice easy-going fantasy flick. But I sure was surprised after seeing the whole movie. There are plenty of LOTR wannabes out there that are heavily marketed and they pretty much all suck. This movie didn't try to be the LOTR, it was just pure fairy tale. I watch a lot of movies, over hundred new ones every year, and only about one or two of them really touch me. This was one of those movies.I don't want to write a review because there are many of good ones already in the comments. I just want to say that if you liked this movie, I sincerely hope you watch 10th Kingdom also, it's like the Stardust but lasts for nine hours.",10,3,5,27 October 2007
