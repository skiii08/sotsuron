Despicable Me 2," it's OK... funny but a bit boring
",i wanted to love it... i really did... i love the first one... told many about it... clearly lots of people saw it after it's theatrical run and are excited for part 2... but i saw it last night and it is a little dull... story is weak... predictable...spoilers the main plot is that gru has to find a villain so gru's a good guy now... that's about it... not a bad idea but most of the movie is him stuck in a mall looking for this villain who is one of the shop owners... just not that interesting... and obvious and it just doesn't feel like a lot is at stake.he points to the actual bad guy immediately... we all know this is the dude but the movie keeps going... the bad guy is kind of boring and not much is done... he's pretty generic... the villain (beyond gru) in the first one was so much better.the oldest daughters thing for boys is cute... kristen wiig's character is fun and while their romance is obvious it's still OK the minions save the day... i mean the film.not a bad sequel at all... still funny... carell and wiig are great... movie's just a little dull,6,33,53,5 July 2013
To Rome With Love," Fun delightful comedy
",i had so much fun watching this flick... i really enjoyed how the stories jumped around... didn't mind the subtitles... loved seeing woody on screen... it's not hysterical but it's totally funthe actors all were terrific... the stories all were very different from one anotheri really liked the fantasy element... and all the stories had a fantasy absurd level to them... especially the alec baldwin (he's there he's not there commenting thing)it was a pleasant movie that i smiled through the whole way laughing out loud a bunch of times and was a perfect summer treati know not everyone agrees... but this ranks for me as one of my favorite woody film in the last ten years behind the amazing Paris and match point... mostly because i was totally in the mood for some light comedy and the cast is really wonderful acting was great directing was solidthe humor was very sweet and cute the Rome sights were beautiful,8,7,15,22 June 2012
Monsters University," totally terrific funny lovable sweet comedy
","i loved this movie. at first i was a little out of it because it's unusual seeing characters you know so well in a prequel with characters you don't know. you know where mike and sully are gonna end up but the newbies you have no idea. after about 15 minutes though i was totally loving the new guys and by time the whole thing was over i really found myself loving everything about this movie.what's also great is also this is not the same as the first one... it's not an adventure flick but instead it's (obviously) a college comedy and follows the same rules and format as a live action one... making friends, frats, parties, pranks etc... with the great pixar emotional touch to put it over the top.stick around till the very end for a small little extra",8,6,10,20 June 2013
