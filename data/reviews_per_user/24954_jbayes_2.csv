Black Swan," Boring, Predictable, and Depressing
","Wife and I neither one like to go to the movies alone, so I drag her along to movies like 'The Expendables' and she drug me along to 'Black Swan'. Pretty much what I expected, skinny girls spinning on their toes, driven too hard, leading to a predictable ending. Good acting.... Why I gave it an extra star. Lots of ballet. Lots of scenes where you can't tell if it's really happening or not, and lots of painful look closeups of Natale Portmans face. Decided to see it against my better judgement by the glowing reviews but it is a movie about Ballet, Swan Lake, and Ballerinas .... Duh! ... I'm going to make my wife watch 'Machete' to get even with her.",2,7,25,4 January 2011
Inception," 9.3 out of 10???? No Way
","I liked this movie but no way was it as great as everyone is saying. Beautifully filmed and Directed Is not enough to be considered great. The premise of breaking into someones dream even if it is in a SiFi movie needs to be set up or established somehow, this movie which seems to be set in current times, treats it like a common daily occurrence. The whole purpose of bringing in the girl architect to design a maze where they could out maneuverer the projections seems to have been thrown out the window once the chases started. The dialog gets hard to follow with all the action going on and character development and acting also fall victim to the nonstop mayhem. DiCaprio squinting into the camera is not Oscar worthy acting. While the action is top notch, I didn't really develop any connection with the characters and in many scenes it was hard to tell the good guys from the bad, when both good guys and bad are all dressed in white and running around shooting each other, it's kind of like watching a football game where both teams wear the same uniforms and no numbers. A good summer action movie but with too many flaws to get a 9.3 rating.",5,6,12,20 July 2010
