Deja Vu," I just loved it!
","Simply, it was just awesome, a mind blowing making from the Director Tony Scott. After completing the movie, I was so speechless. The whole time of the movie duration it was attracted me so tightly. I enjoyed my time, and think that learned a new point of view.This movie created such a tension that was mind blowing, I was so attached with this synchronization process, with the background music, with the sound effects and mostly the smooth part is Editing. Hats off to you the boss, Tony Scott. May his soul rest in peace.The acting of Denzel Washington was awesome. I was just counted his every brilliant steps in the movie. On the other hand, Deja Vu means 'already seen' which was perfectly exposed by this film.I just loved this film. Great cheers to 'Deja Vu'.",9,1,2,10 May 2014
