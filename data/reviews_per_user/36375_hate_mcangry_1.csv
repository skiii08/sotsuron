Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Excellent!
","How Tarantino choose the perfect music for these movies I'll never know. What I do know is that I went out and bought the soundtracks for both movies. This is one of the best movies ( sequels ) I've ever seen! Mr. Tarantino has the best judgment on actors/actresses. I mean he picks people out who have been stereotyped, branded, whatever, to play parts in his movies and they always turn out to be fantastic! Watch these movies! These movies are perfect! You'll come out to say, ' I want to watch this again!' I believe soundtracks are just as important to movies as anything is, these movies are perfectly tuned to music a they are to action! Again this movie is number one with me Tarantino has really out-done himself with this, and again....perfect movie!",10,19,39,16 February 2005
