Blade Runner 2049," Pretentious, ponderous, dull
","In those ways it's very like its predecessor. The original, like most of Ridley Scott's work, spends so much time on visuals and lingers over them far too long to the detriment of story and pace. This film runs at 2:43 telling a story that would barely fill an hour if it wasn't for long, loving shots of pretty sets and portentous glances. It doesn't have the saving grace of allowing an interesting world, having interesting characters or a moment's tension. There isn't a moment when a character seems to feel any urgency about anything. Even after the climactic fight Joe takes time to gaze meaningfully at his fallen foe and stroke her cheek despite the fact that Deckard is trapped and drowning.
Through much of the film we're supposed to believe, like the character, that he's the child. Yet he does so many things a human couldn't possibly do there's no surprise to discover that he's not. He barely responds to his lover's pointless death so why would an audience?",4,1,2,25 October 2019
Cloverfield," Hand-held interference spoils reasonable premise.
","The Blair Witch Project has a lot to answer for. None of it good.J.J. Abrams latest production has taken chunks of Godzilla and mixed them with Blair Witch's hand-held, reality TV style and web-buzz advertising and come up with a film equally annoying and devoid of interest.There's a good premise here which seems to be looking at the action in Godzilla from the viewpoint of ordinary citizens not involved in the main action. As a result the main monster is almost kept to the status of featured extra. The fact that the creature looks so much like the CGI from Godzilla helps this impression along nicely as does our heroes being chased through the subway by small versions of the parent. The cast are pretty and the performances more than adequate, but Abby & I were both ready to leave by 20 minutes in and afterwards we heard not one good comment from the assembled reviewers. Several did leave.What's the problem? It's that hand-held style. Leave aside that we're supposed to believe that a slacker who didn't want to use a camcorder he's never handled suddenly becomes an obsessive photo-journalist who continues to film even as being attacked or running from explosions. Forget that we're supposed to believe a domestic cam-coder can film constantly for about 8 hours on one battery and an SD Card (I want an SD card that can hold that much footage!). Ignore that the military don't take it from them as they run around filming their operations or that it's apparently indestructible. Forget all the stupid rubbish you're just meant to ignore and all the rip-offs from other films and being unable to care about most of the characters & their yuppie lives & concerns. The BIG problem is that hand-held style.There are times you can't even look at the screen it's so awful. In a thriller/horror movie the only thing that should make the audience look away is fear not motion-sickness induced by aimlessly waving the camera around. Long sequences pointed at the floor as people run, more lying at an awkward angle as the action flits incomprehensibly through the static frame or others pointed away from the action leaving only sound for a clue as to what's happening.The style is meant to make one feel part of the action. It's meant to give a sense of immediacy and truth and use the power of imagination to heighten the tension. What it does is get very irritating very quickly and soon becomes an insurmountable barrier to connecting with the story. Did no-one watching the rushes spot this? Or were they all too busy feeling self-satisfied & clever? Hell, they couldn't even be bothered coming up with a real title; they named it after the street the production offices were in. SHows the level of thought they actually put into this mess.Total turkey. Avoid at all costs.",1,11,25,31 January 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Exciting, but flawed finale.
","REVENGE OF THE SITH (Warning! Spoilers included) I saw Revenge of the Sith yesterday and actually enjoyed it. I even enjoyed it quite a lot. I doubt that I'll ever be as taken with a movie as I was by a New Hope and pity all those who didn't get the effect of the Imperial Star Destroyer as an introduction to what cinema is capable of.There's a lot of really good stuff in RotS. We finally get to see a proper space battle where the capital ships do something other than just float in space. Full-on broadsides,gun-decks, explosive decompression,fighters firing at the big ships having no effect and getting t****ed for their insolence. All the stuff that should have been in the Battle of Endor but wasn't. I mean an A-Wing taking out a super Star Destroyer? Puhlease!Don't listen to the reviews that dismiss Hayden Christensen & Natalie Portman's performances. They are well measured and delivered and it's not their fault George writes such clunky dialogue. Obi-Wan & Anakin's banter is much more natural than before and goes some way towards restoring the humour bypass Episodes 1&2 suffered. Ian McDiarmid is superb as the Emperor. I've had the good fortune to see him on stage and was thrilled to see him finally get the chance to show some of that talent in a Star Wars movie. I wonder how many people will connect that he made Anakin? The whole 'virgin birth' thing that got ignored in Episode 1 having its resolution in a way that even Anakin doesn't seem to recognise.There are problems with it, but they're mostly pretty minor. At the end 3PO gets a memory wipe to protect the twins'identity and where they've been sent, but Artoo doesn't. Why? Can't the sith get something to translate an astromech's beeps? There are a lot of the usual crap physics screw-ups. During the aforementioned space battle, the ship our heroes are on rescuing Palpatine gets damaged and pitches forward. Everyone and everything on the ship fall forward, staying that way until the ship is levelled off again. Why's this a problem? The ships have artificial gravity. This will mean that it doesn't matter which way the ship orients itself the floor will always be down. Oh, and if you're standing still and someone sprays oil over your feet you do not immediately begin to slide around like a bad slapstick routine.Anakin has a bit of a problem when Palpatine orders him to execute Count Dooku, but accepts it, does it and  despite a wee whinge about it not being the Jedi code  says no more about it and is not angry with Palpatine for giving the order. Later, when asked by Obi-Wan & the council to spy on Palpatine, he completely goes off on one because, yes, it's against the Jedi code. This is a big part of his motivation for going to the dark side. Added to his odd conviction that Padme is going to die in childbirth and somehow decides that the dark side can save her. Even when he doesn't get the information from the Emperor, he doesn't get angry with him.That brings me to my biggest problem with it. When Padme has given birth she just dies for no apparent reason. She doesn't have a difficult birth, she hasn't suffered a lot of damage from Anakin's force-choke and the medics even say there's nothing physically wrong with her. She just loses the will to live. When she dies there is no effort made to revive her, not even by Obi-Wan who we saw trying to save her in Anakin's vision of her death. Hardly the strong, independent woman she's been shown as up until now. Her husband turned evil and died so she just drops dead? Come on, George. More damage from the force-choke and she wills herself to live to see her children born, yes. She just abandons them? No. Remember Luke & Leia's conversation about their mother in Jedi? Leia remembers her mother, which gives the impression that she went into hiding with her. That makes things even better. Padme goes into hiding, damaged by the force choke, perhaps, but never really gets over Anakin's betrayal and dies young. But no, we have to have the entire plot resolved. No loose threads because it seems we're too thick to figure out something like that happening between Episodes 3 & 4. Given that there's to be a TV show set in that period it could have been resolved there. Character development has never been a forte of Mr Lucas'. Speaking of changing things previously established might I quote Yoda? 'A Jedi uses the force for knowledge and defence. Never for attack.' All the Jedi use the force to throw things at opponents, knock them off high places & smash them into walls.There's far too much reliance on CGI some of it quite poorly done. The wookies are repeated very obviously in their big appearance (The whole wookie thread is a waste of time, by the way.) and things are done just because they can be not because they advance the plot or make things better. There's a dreadful shot on Coruscant where the characters seem to glide above the surface they're walking on. I know, I know; I'm sounding negative. Put it this way, though: this time I care enough to talk about it. The last two weren't worth the effort.",7,20,38,14 May 2005
