Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Not at all what i expected
","I've decided to make this a review for both volume 1 & 2, simply because I'm too lazy to write two.Every time you see a Tarantino film you know it's going to be original and clever and that's exactly what i expected from Kill Bill. Well it certainly had the originality but it's the cleverness that made movies like 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Reservoir Dogs' so great that this one lacks.Especially in Volume 1 it seems as if they are trying to hide the quite dull and uninteresting story behind lots of gore and 'cool' effects and sure they've done a good job because it seems to have fooled the majority of movie goers.Volume 2 was a bit better, it seemed more mature and intelligent than the first one and this is much thanks to some great acting especially from Uma Thurman who gives us a very believable and human assassin.    I often found that the only reason why I kept watching was due to Thurman's acting and i certainly hope we're going to get to see a lot of her from now on.Kill Bill isn't a bad movie, it does have it's bright moments and some very interesting characters but it isn't a 'top 250-movie' either mainly because it just tries a bit too hard and sometimes it can actually get kind of boring which i thought would be impossible in a Quentin Tarantino Film.I'll give Kill Bill vol. 1 & 2 7/10 stars for some great characters and acting but a not so great story.",7,1,3,16 August 2004
