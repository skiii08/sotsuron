Iron Man 3," VERY GOOD from a non-comic book follower's view
","First of all, let me dismiss every bad review here. They are just angry that the script didn't follow more of the comic book world---which by the way, sucks anyways. This is by far the best of the Iron Man series. The movie starts slow...and then builds into major action. I won't give any details away, but the movie script is good, the character development is good, and the special effects are mind blowing. I WANT to offend all those that gave the movie a poor rating...and say...get a life (it's not the worst Marvel movie ever). I would probably go see this movie again if I could afford it. So, yes, the movie is great, borderlining on the best of the best. Go see it and write your own review.Eddie Jackson http://eddiejackson.net",10,2,8,7 May 2013
Interstellar," No spoilers...just amazing.
","I don't normally write reviews for movies, but I'd thought I'd chime in on Interstellar---just because it's such an amazing film (one you'll watch again and again). Sound 10/10, visual 10/10, cinematography 10/10, science 10/10, and acting 10/10. It's a must see movie (preferably on a big screen with the sound turned up). Why is it so good? Well, there are many reasons, but my number reason is the science. You can tell the writers and directors have woven real science into the movie, unlike many other Sci-Fi/fantasy movies. I won't give any spoilers, just know when they are talking about science, it's what we know as of today. The actors are great, with McConaughey and Hathaway (along with the many other actors) delivering great performances. The AI used in the movie is practical and believable. The soundtrack is amazing...the visuals are stunning. Go see it! Or, it's a must-buy on Blu-ray. I bought the movie, and watched the bonus extras---they just add to the overall movie experience. Now, go watch it. :-)I went through and was reading the reviews...let me say this about the 'bad' reviews (1 star, really?)...a movie with 33 wins and 94 nominations isn't bad. It must be you. Stop trolling movies reviews.",10,4,10,20 April 2015
Bohemian Rhapsody," Just Amazing!
","Malek, wow. A performance worthy of an Oscar. The story was great. The music superior. And, the acting by everyone was on point. Go see this at the theater. A movie that allows you to see into (some of) the life of Freddie.",10,3,4,18 November 2018
Dunkirk," Should have been better
","Okay...I guess that's the review, just, okay. Without IMAX, it would have fallen below my score of 6/10. I saw this movie on 7/24/2017, in an IMAX theater. While the screen and sound were amazing, the movie itself suffered from character development, or the lack thereof. I also think this movie was barely PG13, ranging closer to PG, which a serious war movie should be rated R, in my opinion. I honestly don't know how this movie is getting 8's, 9's, and 10's---it just isn't that great. Without giving anything away, you basically only connect with one character, and you still learn nothing about him.What this movie needed: -Character development -Tighter plot -In sync, instead of out of sync storytelling -And women who helped in the war effortIf you see this movie, sit close to the screen (IMAX does make the flight scenes awesome), and bring food; no use you being hungry and bored.",6,6,16,24 July 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Go watch it - Judge for yourself
","#1, This movie is not a 1 outta 10 stars. People who say that should be banned from IMDb, as they are obviously idiots. Thanks for bringing down the score. This movie is better than the score.#2, The acting is mostly top-notch...other than a couple minor hiccups.#3, The CGI is VERY good.#4, The music track is done so well; they blend in the superman and batman themes seamlessly.#5, Yes, the movie is dark, and pretty serious most of time; that's the point of the DC world---get used to it.#6 The introduction of the DC characters was done quite well. Remember, this is only the beginning. #7, The fight scenes, alone, are worth going to the movie in the theater.My recommendation, go see the movie for yourself.",10,6,12,4 April 2016
Moon," Best of the Best
","For a lower budget film, it has set the new baseline for all movies in this class. This is truly Rockwell's Mona Lisa. Acting is great, storyline is excellent, and the whole plot makes sense. It is truly unfortunate this film didn't completely rock the box office. I'm hoping anyone who likes sci-fi sees this film. Without giving too much away, Rockwell and Spacey deliver an awesome movie, without having 100's of people, or millions of dollars in special effects. It just goes to show you, great movies do not need all that, and oftentimes can ruin a movie, i.e. Jupiter Ascending. Plot matters, story matters, liking the characters matters. This film has all of that and more. Go see it now.",10,0,3,11 July 2015
