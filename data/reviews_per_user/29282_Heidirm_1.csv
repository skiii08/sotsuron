United 93," Flight 93
","I just saw the movie tonight. The theater was packed but you could hear a pin drop during and after the show. I thought it was a powerful and compelling film. I left the theater feeling a lot like I did on the day of 9/11. I felt that it was probably an accurate portrayal of the events as good be done. Kudo's to the director and writer for not focusing on one person but showing the events as a whole. I only wish we could make this film mandatory viewing for the entire country. We seem to have a short memory in this country. This film should remind people why we are at war. This is not a Hollywood interpretation, there is no character development, just the events of the day and the brave people on board that flight. I wonder how many of us could step up in those circumstances and do what those people did. True Heroes, each and everyone of them",10,9,17,28 April 2006
