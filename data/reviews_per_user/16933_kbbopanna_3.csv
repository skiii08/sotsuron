Black Swan," Rubbish and Disgusting
","This movie is boring, sick and disgusting just like the lady Protagonist in the movie. Right from the beginning to end all I see is Rubbish. Only thing this movie does is promoting immorality. All the characters in the movie are sex addicts in one or the other way. This movie not thrilling nor it sends right message to the Society. There is no story in the movie, but this movies has been dragged to boring 1.48 hours.",1,4,6,13 April 2018
Source Code," Does not make sense at all
","Everything in the movie was good untill the last 10 to 15 minutes of the movie. Going by the end part of the movie, this movie does not make sense at all. In one scene captain colleen tells colter that there was a train bombing at 7.30 in the morning and he should prevent the further attacks which are going to happen. But at the end of the movie we hear someone telling to Dr. Rutledge that there was an attempt to blow up the train at 7.30 am but the attack failed. We know that colter saves the train from bomb explosion in source code but in the reality world indeed there was a train bomb explosion at 7.30 am and how did it turned as failed attack in real world by end of the movie. Also how can colter gets into the body of Sean permanently and enter real world from source code, whiles his body is still in the Life support and his mind is still active.Also at point we see colleen terminating the life support of Colter but at the end we see that his mind is still active and his body is still in life support. There are too many flaws in the movie which gets exposed in the last 10 to 15 minutes of the movie.",1,3,8,10 April 2018
Inception," Boring and Overrated
","Concept is too nonsensical and illogical, how can someone have multiple dreams within a Dream?? The story of the movie is that, to plant an Idea in a CEO's mind, a group of People Dream within the dream, again dream within the second dream and within the second dream they dream third dream. Movie ending is ambiguous, it does not give the clarity if everything happened in real or in Dream . This is indeed one of the most overrated boring movie ever.",1,2,4,12 November 2017
