Skyfall," Pretty Good. Not 'The Best Bond Ever' as Advertised
","Skyfall is pretty good, although it is not 'The Best Bond Ever' as advertised. Then again, promotions tend to exaggerate in the first place. Great opening sequence, but then it kind of wanders for a while. When it finally gets back on track, it reminded me more of a Bourne Identity film than either of the two most recent Bond films. The new Quartermaster is pretty well done, and I like the way they have kept the gadgets out of the new series. It is difficult to offer too much without including spoilers, and so I'd say, go see this one as it is worth your time. Just don't expect anything that tops Casino Royal, and you will really enjoy this film.",6,1,8,12 November 2012
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," All Star Wars Movies Should Have Been This Strong
","This is an amazing film and represents what the entire series could have been (should have been).It is dark and edgy with bit of that Game of Thrones 'nobody is safe' element added for good measure.I suggest you see this in 3D as there is plenty to make it worth the extra asking price.On a side note, of all Star Wars movies, this was one I had almost no interest in seeing except to save myself from spoilers.To contrast this with something else in order to amplify my point, this is to Star Wars what Casino Royal was to James Bond - way overdue and much appreciated.The Force is with me, I am one with The force.<ul><li>Richard Phoebus</li></ul>",10,1,6,20 December 2016
Suicide Squad," Terrible Movie (Was that a Spoiler?)
","If I were charged with naming this movie, and getting a reflective and honest title would land me a million bucks, but I only got one shot at naming the thing, I'd go with, 'Worse than Watching Baby Darth Vader and Jar Jar Binks Getting Their Toes Painted while Reading Cosmo and Sipping on Zima'Maybe we can all get our money back if we get together as a group and ask in a nice manner.The only thing more disappointing than this would have been to walk in and get forced to be part of a test audience for a series of Lindsay Wagner's Hallmark Channel films.",3,6,11,31 August 2016
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," We liked it a lot. Not sure why so much hate on this
","Having just seen The Rise of Skywalker, I can say that we really enjoyed the movie and don't see why there is so much hate being directed at it.
I suppose that for some folks who may have read the books, win the trivia contests, and take fandom to a different level it may have been too far from what they had expected - whatever that was.
However, if you like light sabers, lots of explosions, and enjoy the series in general that you will find a lot to enjoy in this movie.",8,7,15,30 December 2019
Quantum of Solace," A great end to Casino Royal.
","A great end to Casino Royal. If it were a stand-alone feature, okay... maybe light. However, considering that this Bond's revenge upon those that killed Vesper, it is a great film--simply the conclusion of Casino Royal. It is great that they are keeping the gadgets out of these films, and I hope it stays that way. Bond was and is better without the gadgets (Thunderball as best original example). My only critique of the film is that they have elected to reintroduce the typical Bond ending whereby the Evil-Doers hideaway blows up during the final sequence. If they can find a way for darker and more understated endings to these films, such as the ending of Casino Royal, I would say they have the perfected Bond's reinvention.",Null,1,5,24 December 2008
Prometheus," Prometheus is Awesome!
","Ridley Scott has done it again! Prometheus is awesome, and while many things take place without explanation, that is much like life. Stuff happens. You see it. You move on. Some stuff matters later on, and other stuff was just there because not everything in life serves an obvious purpose. After watching this at the midnight opening, we were talking for hours about 'What did that mean?' and 'Why did he do this thing at the beginning?', and it made for great conversation. How many films are worth talking about for hours on end after you have seen them? Much like a Kubrick production, Prometheus leaves so much unanswered that it will fuel a lot of really great conversations for a long time. Ignore any negative reviews and see this one for yourself.",9,3,8,8 June 2012
