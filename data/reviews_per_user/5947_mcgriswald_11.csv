Scarface," Realistic portrayal of a cocaine kingpin
","As the entire drug culture segued from the psychedelic era of the 60s and early 70s to the Studio 54/Disco era of the late 70s, early 80s, an interesting phenomenon, the ultra-violent drug lord appeared. Americans who may have shunned LSD and marijuana became enrapt by the drug of glamor, cocaine. With the increased demand came huge profits to be made by those ruthless and violent enough to dominate the underground world of narcotics trafficking.Enter Tony Montana, a man who was in the right place at the right time, and could parlay his own extreme amoral ambitions into untold wealth. The character played by Al Pacino in the movie Scarface is often written off as over the top, too violent and too extreme.Far from it.Men like Tony Montana were responsible for a murder rate that grew 500% in cities like Los Angeles and Miami. Places where authorities would estimate with total seriousness that two people would be killed by falling bullets fired from these gangster's automatic weapons in celebration of New Years.Men like Tony Montana were responsible for the federal governments discontinuing the printing of higher denomination bills, since they were usually used by drug dealers. Men who not only used the famed automatic bill counter, but got to a point where they were weighing money instead of counting it.That Tony was Cuban only fit the Mariel Boatlift plot device at the beginning; he could have been Colombian, Mexican or Jamaican, among others. That Tony suffered hubris and met his demise reflected events that were far too common. That he died in a hail of automatic weapons and that military style arms were used was also not an atypical death for one of these guys. Rocket launchers, hand grenades, armor piercing rounds--all occasionally used against adversaries.Tony's descent into madness and paranoia was also typical of cocaine addiction--while most people don't suffer as flashy an end as Tony, thousands and thousands of people ended up as addled as he.So for those of you out there who think this all just a big overwrought exercise in excess, think again.",8,0,1,11 February 2007
The Ring," Ring introduced new horror genre
","When I first saw The Ring, I had yet to see other films of that type, such as the original Japanese films, The Grudge and Dark Water.For me, the film introduced the creepy, malevolent water child with jet black hair. Just the way the thing crawled around was frightening, and I had goosebumps throughout the film, which I saw on TV.Although I grew up in Seattle, it was hard to recognize the dark, Gothic locations, particularly the island where the child grew up. I knew where it was, but I never associated that island with anything that dark and foreboding.This film is truly scary, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to see a good non-slasher type of horror film. Its one of the few horror films that I have seen in recent years that I would go back and watch a second time.",8,1,2,1 February 2007
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Maudlin tripe
","When ET first came out, I was at a nihilistic punky point in my life and thought it was absolute dreck. The woman who brought me to the film was seeing for her third time, and she was having orgasms of pure bliss, and expecting me to feel the same way. I was diplomatic, after all, I wanted to get laid, but it was a real chore to feign the slightest emotion over a squashed head alien and his foul-mouthed child protector.Years later, after the film had made many top ten greatest movies of all time lists, and at a point where I was more 'sensitive', I went back and re-watched the movie, trying to see what all the fuss was about.Lord, I really tried, but for the life of me, I just don't get how people have swallowed Spielberg's hook. Don't get me wrong, Spielberg is the world class manipulator of our feelings towards his movies, and I have taken his drug many times and liked it, but ET just sucks.",1,32,80,26 January 2007
Training Day," Unbelievable coincidence
","In Altman's 'The Player' there is a subplot that involves a writer of a film who insists that his film retains his dark 'non-Hollywood' ending--he is adamant during his pitches that 'life is like that' and that people don't always live and that endings aren't always happy. He ends up selling out, and his movie has a stereotypical Hollywood ending in which a character played by Bruce Willis pulls a daring last second rescue of the formerly doomed heroine, played by Julia Roberts, complete with snappy exchange between the characters.In 'Training Day' there is a unrealistic coincidence that allows Ethan Hawke's character to survive a situation where he should have died; I immediately thought about 'The Player'. I can hear the producers insisting that the hero (Hawke) survive, and that the villain (Washington) get a comeuppance. They may have shot an ending in which Hawke dies, and Denzel Washington's character goes on leading his corrupt life, but like in 'The Player', it 'didn't test well' with audiences in an advanced screening.I also was never convinced that Denzel could be so rotten, the fact that he always played heroes weighed on my ability to suspend disbelief, but that is my own subjective opinion. Denzel certainly played the character well, but I am not alone in my opinion that the Academy gave him the Oscar as a 'makeup' for his being passed over before.What ruined the movie for me was the pat ending, and the coincidence that allowed it.",2,5,8,26 January 2007
The Best Years of Our Lives," Neatly escapes every opportunity to be cliché and sappy
","Best Years of Our Lives is a film that slipped under my radar for years--I had heard about it, but never had the opportunity to watch it. Thanks to TCM On Demand, I was able to watch it uncut and commercial free.What surprised me about this film was how quickly it was made after the war. The film frankly deals with the people who were wounded in the war, both physically and mentally. It manages neatly to encompass nearly all the varieties of war experience within three characters.We have the Air Force officer, who was a veteran of the early European bombing campaign. Because of the horrific attrition rate amongst the crews of the bombers, the Air Force at that time had a reputation for cranking out officers who quickly rose through the ranks. Such was case with this fellow who went from a lowly soda jerk in civilian life to a Captain and bombardier of his B-17. He also suffers from PTSD, called 'battle fatigue' at the time.We have the Army non-com who served in the Pacific, and suffered through the horrors of that campaign. His story is opposite that of the Air Force fellow in that he goes from a prestigious job as a banker to a lowly grunt in the Army and rises to the rank of Sergeant. From the stripes on his sleeve it is clear that he is the highest level of Sergeant, yet he is still on the front line.Finally we have the Navy Seaman, who is part of the faceless support staff, commonly referred to as REMFs (Rear Echelon MFers)by the fellows on the line. Ironically, he suffers the worst physical wounds when working as a mechanic below decks on a Navy ship, his ship is struck, presumably by a kamikaze and is sunk with loss of 400 lives. He is pulled from the water but his badly burned hands are amputated and replaced with prosthetic hooks.BYOOL tells the story of how these three meet on a transport plane they have boarded for home, and how they readjust into civilian society.What impressed me most about this film is that despite the obvious issues that face the three protagonists, it never descends into melodrama. The Navy kid, played by an actual amputee, is placed into situations where we might feel sorry for him, yet the script never lets us feel that emotion. The Army sergeant is clearly an alcoholic, and the story points that out, but never dwells on it. The Air Force captain struggles with the loss of status when he is forced to return to the drug store he soda jerked in (now bought out by a large chain) and take a demeaning job to support his ungrateful and disloyal wife.The script allows plenty of opportunities for all these characters to come to some dramatic climax regarding their plights, but it neatly avoids that. But for the overly dramatic score, the director has tread around exploiting the obvious.In one scene that well represents the entire movie, the daughter of the Army sergeant (Frederic March) is having a discussion with her father and mother regarding the Air Force captain. Despite his marriage, they have fallen in love, and she is determined to break up the marriage which is obviously troubled. Now we've seen thousands of scenes typical of this where the father blusters angrily and the daughter ends up running away to her room in tears, slamming the door and falling on the bed. Later, Mom shows up, consoles daughter and offers words of motherly wisdom, and everybody lives happily ever after.In BYOOL, this scene plays out completely differently than the cliché I have described above. Sure the conversation gets heated, but all parties are reasonable, and there is a serious and timeless discussion of the nature of relationships that has some of the best dialog I have seen.Ultimately, BYOOL is a highly satisfying film, with honest performances from the entire cast. Technically, it is well shot, the editing and cinematography frame, but never overshadow the gripping narrative. Despite the score, which is cliché and over-dramatic, I give this film the highest rating that it clearly deserves",10,14,17,22 February 2007
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Prudes, ninnies, foreigners and the excessively sensitive need not apply!
","I have a theory about this type of comedy.Unless you are an American with some semblance of a normal middle class upbringing, you will neither 'get' nor appreciate the humor of films like The 40 Year Old Virgin. I identified with Steve Carrell's character, in that I, too, have had my share of bizarre sexual encounters--had there been a 'perfect storm' of these types of experiences it may have turned me off of sex just like it did poor Andy.Everyone who has any type of normal working life has ran across these co-workers, the smooth playa, the stoner, the lonesome loser, and the guy who cracked me up the most, the foul mouthed little foreign dude. My little foreign dude was Thai waiter named Sammy, while Andy's happened to be a little Indian guy. The part where he is trying to be all sensitive towards Andy and starts spouting about 'butt love' and the 'rusty trombone' and the 'dirty sanchez' had me in tears.Andy, who could have been just another stereotypical dweeb is played with surprising depth by Steve Carrell; he's a fairly normal guy, he just never got laid, and like a bad habit its stuck with him his entire life.The supporting cast, Andy's coworkers, his boss and the various 'hoodrat' women he interacts with hit at perfect pitch. The secondary roles like Paula his boss, and the drunken girl who takes him on an automobile ride from hell are priceless. Her line about wanting some 'Frrrench toast' is a classic.Although Virgin winds down at the end, the total strength of the movie outweighs the anticlimax. If you enjoyed Wedding Crashers and There's Something About Mary you will get a big kick out of 40 Year Old Virgin.",10,1,4,11 February 2007
Saving Private Ryan," Gut wrenching depiction of Normandy invasion
","Reading several of the negative comments about this film, I concluded that they could be grouped into a handful of categories, the pedantic, the America haters, and those who find innate fault with the Spielbergian tendency to manipulate the audience. For those in the Spielberg hating camp, I would ask, What do you expect? Audience manipulation is every bit a hallmark of a Spielberg film as a sappy ending is to a Capra film or existential Jewish angst is to an Allen film.As for the other two categories, it doesn't pretend to be an historically accurate film, it is a dramatization. For the people that feel that Spielberg depicts the Americans as purely good or the Germans as purely evil, I would ask you to go back to two scenes, one where GIs summarily execute a surrendering German, and second, the look of compassion in the eyes of the German sniper when the GI he has just shot is trying to hand off a letter to his family.That said, I would focus on the technical aspects of the film. The initial scene of the invasion looks just like first hand accounts of the Omaha beach invasion I have read. Veterans of the landing who have seen the film have attested to the authentic look and feel of the film. Perhaps what I find most striking is Spielberg's use of old style cameras and film stock that give the movie an old newsreel type flavor.I won't argue with anyone who accuses the actual mission as being unrealistic--I would say that the mission itself is secondary to the storytelling art. It takes little vignettes assembled from stories I have heard over and over from WW2 vets and tells them succinctly.Hank's character suffers from PTSD, known then as 'battle fatigue' ; Vin Diesel's character was the guy who forgot for one second to keep his head down and it cost him; the interpreter overcomes his initial cowardice after it costs his buddy's life; overcome with emotion, another character wants to summarily execute an unarmed German, but is talked out of it; two opposing soldiers who have lost their arms attack each other hand to hand. All of these stories are archetypal and universal among veterans who survived the war.These characters represent the amalgam of experience of all combat soldiers; similar to Platoon, its unrealistic to believe that one small group of soldiers experienced them all, but as a dramatization the story is excellently filmed and told.",9,2,5,28 January 2007
City of God," People actually hate this film
","Whenever I look up a film on IMDb, I typically go to the 'hated it' category and see 1) who is panning it, and 2) what other films they have reviewed and whether or not I share common tastes with the reviewer. Sadly, IMDb doesn't do a good job of filtering out trolls, so there is going to be one star reviews for Citizen Kane type films that aren't really serious, only an attempt to get under people's skin, or possibly an attempt to knock a film down on the Top 250.I also discount the 'worst film of all time/I wasted two hours of my life' kind of reviews as attempts by the writer to get you to read their review. Besides, that approach is tired and cliché.City of God is the type of film that I can honestly only think of two type of 'serious' negative reviews: People who are offended by the violence, and perhaps individuals who are dyslexic and can't keep up with the subtitles. For everyone else, this is patently a great, entertaining film.I try to rent this film at least once a year, and will watch it when it comes on Sundance or IFC. Aside from the technical aspects of the film, it is a great and compelling story.If you enjoy great gangster films like the Godfather or Goodfellas, you need to rent City of God as soon as you can. You won't regret it.",10,1,4,1 February 2007
There's Something About Mary," Getting your twig and berries caught in a zipper is not funny....
","...but watching the 'Oh sweet Jesus' reaction to the people who see it is priceless.I mean, its just downright tragic what happen's to poor Ben Stiller's character, but the 'you gotta see this' attitude displayed by the cops and firemen who show up is what makes 'There's Something about Mary' into the comedy gem that it is.Incongruities, perfectly timed incongruities are what makes this film tick, and the Farelly brothers showed the importance of editing, timing and context that make this film one of the funniest comedies of all time. In lesser hands, this material might have become consigned to the bin where all tasteless, stupid and sophomoric films lie; it is tasteless, stupid and sophomoric... and pure genius.When you look at comedy classics like 'Some Like it Hot' or 'It Happened One Night', the material is less funny to the modern film-goer, but they remain funny because the interplay between characters and the editing are rock solid. Its all about the delivery.Years back, my wife and I were film buffs--we saw all the art-house stuff as well as the mainstream films. Today, we may see three or four movies a year in the theater. We saw 'There's Something About Mary' after it had gone to HBO, and we both had tears coming down our faces. We hadn't read any reviews, nor had any of our friends spoiled it for us, so we saw it cold, unprepared for the level of hilarity.One of my favorite lines: 'You said she was cute as a button!''No, I said butt plug...she's heinous.'",10,1,3,1 February 2007
Groundhog Day," Murray and Ramis' Greatest Film
","On the very first episode of 'Late Night with David Letterman', Bill Murray ran to the edge of the stage where he led the audience in an impromptu set of calisthenics while he sang 'Lets Get Physical'. That was the early Bill, a man who paradoxically was a smarmy phony and infectiously enthusiastic at the same time.Later on, in 'Lost in Translation' and 'Broken Flowers' Murray has become more introspective. 'Groundhog Day' somehow catches Murray as he in the midst of the transformation from early Bill to the current Bill.When I first saw 'Groundhog Day' I remember leaving the theater feeling oddly moved, as if I had just witnessed something that was simutltaneously humorous fluff and deeply important. Later on, and upon further viewings, it dawned on me that this was the greatest film of redemption ever made, and one of my favorite films of all time.I won't rehash the plot, other than to say that Murray's character, Phil, undergoes a transformation from incredulity to opportunism to despondence, and finally acceptance and understanding that this day is his to perfect.During his transformation, Phil goes from superficial to caring and motivated, and to me that is an interesting parallel with Murray's career. One scene that is particularly telling is when Phil is wooing Andy McDowall's character by using information he has gleaned on previous days. At first, his attempts work, but as he tries to re-create the scenes that help his seduction succeed, his method becomes rote and forced. Like his voice work on the 'Garfield' films, he is just phoning it in.Once he realizes that his attempts are a sham, Phil becomes despondent and tries to get himself out of his personal purgatory by various attempts at suicide, but each day starts anew with Sonny and Cher singing 'I Got You, Babe'. As Phil reaches acceptance of his fate, he takes his cue from the characters and the town of Punxatawny, and becomes genuinely interested and involved with his surroundings.On Phil's final day, Ramis and Murray shine. Not one misstep, everything clicks, and you can't help but smile as Phil captures the love and attention of the town and his associates not through guile and phoniness, but with genuine effort and caring.If you are one of the few people who hasn't seen this fine film, rent or buy the DVD ASAP. To this day, I don't believe that Ramis and Murray are fully aware of the importance of this film, but as time has gone on since its release, critics (including the IMDb folks) have recognized as the truly excellent film that it is.",10,2,4,26 January 2007
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Everyone got shortchanged
","For the apologists for this movie, I have to admit they have a point. The special effects are exemplary, and to the non-Potter reader, it certainly is an eyeful.For all the British schoolchildren who are Potter maniacs and have universally expressed their extreme displeasure, I feel your pain. Goblet of Fire is my favorite of the Harry Potter books, and it is a pleasure to read the extreme detail and careful subplots that JK Rowling has crafted.The biggest loser, however, was anyone with a financial stake in the movie: Rowling, the studio, and the investors.Originally, GOF was planned as a two-parter, to be filmed simultaneously like the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The two parts could have been released 8 or so months apart, and would have effectively doubled the income from the film--had it been true to the book, repeat viewings and increased DVD sales might have tripled that income.Unfortunately for both the fans of the book and the monied interests, the director was talked into condensing the book into one film, and the result is less than satisfying to all concerned. During filming, JK Rowling was either pregnant or had just given birth, so her attention was expectedly elsewhere, but I don't doubt that if she was giving her full attention to the film she would have insisted on a two-parter.Given the reaction of her fans to the movie, I am sure she has some second thoughts about that decision.",5,1,1,28 January 2007
