Hereditary," Psychological Horror/ thriller
",This movie reminds me a lot of The Shining with in intense focus on how the movie is shot and also how it's it's psychological aspects create the horror. The plot gets a little confusing at the end but the movie overall is very good. The title implies that it is about mental illness but there is more to it than that. Prepare to feel disturbed and confused after the movie finishes.,8,6,12,11 June 2018
