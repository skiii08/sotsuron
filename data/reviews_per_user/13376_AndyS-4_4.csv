The Blair Witch Project," Terrific Movie...Tense...Sticks With You
","This was an outstanding movie.  It felt so real.  I could feel their sense of helplessness.  The concept was brilliant.  By only showing the view they saw, you were literally put in their shoes.  The images stuck in my head for days.",Null,0,1,6 August 1999
A Bug's Life," great animation but same old plot; great closing credits
","The movie definitely had great animation.  But the plot was the same old 'shunned misfit comes back, saves the day and is a hero'.  The best part of the movie were the phoney outtakes they showed during the closing credits. Don't miss that.  Also the pixar short feature before the movie was very good.  It had a much more interesting story line.",6,0,1,13 December 1998
Ice Age," Not funny and poor animation
","I hardly laughed at all.  I thought the animation was poor (what movie was everyone else watching?).  The humans characters moved like they have lead weights on their feet.  Okay, I figure the movie was made for kids.  But the plot is about some tigers trying to kidnap and kill a human baby.  And along the way, the baby's mother dies.  What a lovely plot for a child!  What a disappointment!  The only good parts were shown in the trailers.",4,2,4,15 April 2002
Gladiator," 1 dimensional characters and poor filming of the fights
","This movie really disappointed me.  The characters were one dimensional. The battles in the arena were confusing.  Things happened so fast and the shots were usually so close up, that I couldn't make out what was going on. I think some slow motion could have made it more effective.",3,0,3,22 May 2000
