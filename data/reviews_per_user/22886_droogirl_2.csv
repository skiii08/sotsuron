The Blair Witch Project," the greatest movie of the century
","From beginning to end the silence in the movie theater showed how remarkable the movie was. The actors in the movie showed real fear. It was no slasher movie, it was all in your mind. The most thrilling part was at the end. The movie was so terrifying that even a high school boy sitting in front of me could not take it so he walked out. The movie was getting so interesting that I had to wait to go to the bathroom. I highly recommend this movie to all.",Null,0,0,8 August 1999
