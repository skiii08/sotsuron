Alien 3," Above Average
","Alien 3 follows on from a great film Aliens and i think that Fincher has done an above average Job with this one.It was always going to be difficult to follow on from a movie like aliens but this film lacks the action shown from Aliens. It was a bit frustrating at the fact that Hicks and Newt were dead and Bishop was virtually destroyed after they went through all the struggle of surviving, and I'm still wondering how the Queen Alien Managed to lay that egg in the ship of Aliens.I think that Fincher should have thought better about this before beginning to film.But thats it as far as the criticising goes, I think that the new breed of Alien he has introduced looked impressive and once again there is a good cast of actors which the Alien films never fails to bring.",Null,1,3,3 October 2004
Alien: Resurrection," Underrated Movie
","I am a fan of the all the Alien films including this one and I feel that this movie is highly underrated.Not only has Jeunet thought of a good cover story for the return of Ripley for Alien 3 but has managed to get a quite a good cast of actors behind the movie too.I have only recently seen this this film and aware that it come out in 1997 but i heard that this film isn't very good so i decided to see for myself and fail to see what all the complaints are about the Newborn Alien designs were good and has also found space to fit the Alien queen on as well, the plot was also interesting.I know that it isn't ranked up there with the other Alien films but Jeunet has had a decent attempt at it and fans of Alien films should be thankful that he has tried to revive the Alien films from were it left off instead of leaving the series at number 3.",Null,0,1,30 September 2004
Alien," Classic film
","The beginning of the Alien legacy and a true classic and full credit to H.G Giger who designed the look of the Aliens.I think that Ridley Scott has directed some Classics and i think this is one of them. There is a good cast of actors and what must of been great special visual effect artists in their day,.The Nostromo ship looked very impressive with futuristic gizmos and stuff inside the ship,Lv-426 looked good and the derelict spacecraft with all the alien eggs all looked good it was probably new to sci fi fans. I wasn't even born in 1979 but i bet i could probably see the reaction of the people watching this when the chestbuster burst through the John Hurt it was spectacular effects for a movie made in 1979.",Null,0,1,30 September 2004
Predator," Sci-Fi Classic
","The Thomas Brothers has done a good job to create another breed of Alien species to compete with the original 'Alien' designs created by H.G Giger,it was obvious that when the Predator emerged that these two species had to be put in a Film (Aliens Vs Predator) due to all the debates about who were the more superior species.I think this is were Aliens vs Predator failed i thought they went off the original seven foot something muscular Predator from this film, and replacing them with 'Teenage' short stumpy Predators.i thought by making them small in AvP it took away there agresiveness in a way.Mctiernian has equally done a good job to put these well designed creatures into a great movie,he employed a good recognisable cast of actors too, including Arnold Schwarzenegger.The is a good storyline as well,A team of commandos led by Major Dutch Schaeffer (Schwarzenegger)is sent behind enemy lines secretly by the C.I.A to rescue a group of soldiers who are being held hostage.Unfortunately for 'Dutch' and his team of commandos they get more than they have bargained for.It is time for the Predators Annual hunt and they've picked the exact spot where 'Dutch' and his troops operation is taking place.",Null,0,0,5 October 2004
Aliens," Great Sequel
","Aliens is a brilliant sequel to the hit movie Alien, James Cameron has done brilliantly with this film and manages well not to spoil the series.After 57 years of hypersleep Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) awakes in a gateway station in outer space to realize that lv-426 has been populated with over 70 families there, and the administrators don't realize that they are not the only species up there with them on the planet.Ripley is sent up with a team of marines with persuasion, to try and rescue as many civilians as possible and orders unknown to the rest of the crew for Burke(Paul Reiser)to bring back an alien specimen back with them.Aliens features a good cast of actors and marines with attitude. Cameron gives the natural marine characters you might find in real marine squad with The smart one the wise one and also the jackass one which is Hudson(Bill Paxton).I think that Cameron has done an excellent job here to even raise the number of Alien fans.",Null,0,0,3 October 2004
Alien vs. Predator," A waste of time
","What could be better than Aliens and a group of Predators fighting on one movie? answer-Paint dry.This movie does not have the potential to be a blockbuster film or even deserves to be.Apart from Lance Hendrikson the rest of the actors i have never heard of before,the film was poor,but i cant say i didn't see this coming i never did rate Paul Anderson anyway i think all of the movies he has directed are garbage, but before i saw this movie i thought it would be fair to at least give him another chance but it hasn't paid off. Not only was there insufficient battle scenes between the two species but we still don't know who won the battle between the two species.I think Anderson is actually hinting another movie by adding the sort of cliffhanger ending on it.But this movie has much to improve to rank up there with the other alien + Predator films and it is a disappointment but if you are a die hard fan of this then you may see better of it than me.",Null,1,2,29 September 2004
