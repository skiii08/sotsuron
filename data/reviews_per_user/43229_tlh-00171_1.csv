Blade Runner 2049," Thank you film makers
","I am new to Blade Runner and don't have the whole background down pat, but I enjoyed most of the film. It was bright and new, a whole different experience than the same old same old which I appreciate.I have been married over ten years so you can imagine that my wife is getting larger and driving a SUV now and all that so I look for films and other entertainment to take me out of the ordinary and give me a fantasy and distraction and fun. This was completely different, not just different from reality but also different from other sci-fi. The idea of a holographic wife is exciting and you can imagine that everyone will customize their own to their own satisfaction and mine will look similar to the hologram/advert in this film that is skinny, loving, showing skin and putting on some make up. Love it. If I have to criticize something its that the film was long and it becomes a bit too much without the pretty ladies but overall good one.",Null,2,4,28 October 2017
