The Hangover," funniest movie of the year, laugh out loud funny!
","I don't write reviews at all really but this movie is the funniest this year, it is comparable to 40 year old virgin and pineapple express, heck its even better. Makes you laugh every two minutes. The comedy keeps on coming, the cast is extraordinary, the acting is brilliant,and the comedy is pure genius. the characters are quirky and really amusing, the story is very interesting and entertaining nonetheless. This movie truly stands out, and the ratings only further my point, go watch this movie, i know i did and so did a dozen other people. Good story, great acting, awesome comedy. two thumbs up all the way, if you've been waiting for non-stop laughter, this is it my friends.",10,9,16,18 July 2009
