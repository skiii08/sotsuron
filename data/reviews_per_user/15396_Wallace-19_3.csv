E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," The most beautiful movie ever made
","I really like Steven Spielberg's work. There are a few men we can actually use the term genius to call them and in his kind of cinema, Spielberg is the best. He has a special way to fill our room with magic every time we see one of his movies. Indiana Jones, Hook, Jurassic Park, Empire of the Sun, etc. But I think that with 'ET' he reached the top. He pretty much gathered every magic he had and used it on this movie. I never cry with movies and no, I didn't cry with this one tough, in the famous final scene my stomach did hurt and the sentence 'I'll be right here' really made me levitate. This is one of those movies that can actually transport us to an out-of-this-world-kind-of-adventure, the scene with the kids on the bicycles made me fly too just to follow perhaps the most sad ending of the entire history of cinema. A kid who befriends an alien creating a bound so strong that only the two of them could break. John Williams makes his best soundtrack yet, sad, tender and thrilling. Williams is my favourite composer, this man doesn't know how to make a bad score. Spielberg and Williams together and all of the crew just had to result in a movie like this. Just, absolutelly, the most beautiful movie I've ever seen. Friendship is the most transcendent feeling we can experience, specially beetween an Earth boy and a little alien. A true classic that should be seen by any family, any kid, any grownup, any.. anybody. Only a true cold-hearted wouldn't like this movie.",10,1,2,22 September 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," The best Sci-Fi movie ever made
","One of the best directors of all times died March 1999, Stanley Kubrick. He left us a vast amount of movies, most of them masterpieces, and the others just very good ones. '2001, A Space Odyssey' is his best movie, a true masterpiece that any director would want to make. The first sequence is brilliant, from the dawn of mankind to the threat of the dawn of artificial world and the extinction of Man as dominant specie. This movie is full of symbolism bringing out the special use of symbolic elements by master Stanley Kubrick from the big black thing to the final enigmatic baby scene. This movie achieved something I find brilliant that is the possibility for us to see the movie and make our own interpretation. This movie made me feel small due to it's gigantic power. I think Kubrick looked at our future and showed us his vision of hope and terror. HAL is the perfect character, perfectly created and imagined against Dave, the human challenger who, himself, get's challenged in the final scenes on a surreal experience. This movie is brilliant, just the best SF movie ever made. This is really the ultimate trip, make sure you don't miss it but be prepared to find things you don't even dream about.",10,1,3,29 September 1999
Blade Runner," Riddley Scott's best and the 2nd best Sci-fi movie of all time
","In this movie Riddley Scott gives a lesson in futuristic film-noir genre. The first open sequence of the city is breathtaking, the flames, the buildings, specially Tyrell Corporation, all of this, brilliantly conducted by Vangelis soundtrack. To talk about this movie is to talk about the 3 essencial questions that the Human Being asks himself: 'Where do I come from? Where will I go? How long have I got left?'. This gives the movie it's philosofical perspective. The artifial world and the human specie are placed in this movie to show how dangerous it can get to 'play God'. The 'replicants' are, supposedly, emocionally inexperient, flaw that is only possible to fix by memory implants. The end lines for Rutger Hauer brilliant performance prooves his humanity, perhaps this is the true theme of the movie: humanity, where does it starts, where does it ends, what boundries surround it and defines the human being? 'I've seen things you people wouldn't believe', this is one of the most powerful moments of the entire film, the memories as builders of his emotions, his love for life...where is the boundry? The boundry that separates us from 'replicants'. Maybe life is just a constant quest for answers, those wich would reveal the meaning of life, death and our dawn. 'Blade Runner' represents all of this brilliantly, and at the same time shows us a future, a dark and destructed future. Harrison Ford is excelent in the part of detective Deckard, a man in search of answers to his own questions, seeking those who threaten the human specie. During the movie he talks severall times about how 'blade runners' musn't feel anything for the non-humans, but what better diplay of humanity than the one given by Rutger Hauer (Roy)? This is my 2nd favourite Sci-Fi movie of all time, being '2001, A Space Odyssey' the first.
