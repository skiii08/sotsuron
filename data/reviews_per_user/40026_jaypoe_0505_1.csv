The Avengers," The best movie ever.
","On May 4, 2012 many Marvel fans were on the edge of their seats, and I was one of those fans. I can say that our expectancy for the new movie 'The Avengers' was through the roof, and we would not be happy with anything under five stars. Marvel had promised the Avengers Initiative would return, and from that point on it had been a waiting game. However, combining all of the super heroes into one great team, yet each holding their old attitudes had to take time. The wait was well worth it though; Marvel really dished it out. They produced a movie that I could watch over and over again, and never be bored. The cast was wonderful, and I can't say that there was a single actor that did not play their part perfectly. The movie was full of action, and there was never a dull moment in the humor. However, if you have not seen the other movies leading up to it, you may find yourself lost in some parts. The plot was phenomenal, and was accompanied by visual effects that put you inside the movie itself. I would highly recommend this movie to everyone, it is entertaining, humorous, and overall a blast to watch. Some of the characters showed their true colors in this movie more than in their own productions. One of my favorite quotes in the movie being Captain America's thoughts on Thor, when he says 'There is only one God, and I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.' Aside from my thoughts, one actor that really deserves a round of applause is Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk. Through the movie he acts seamlessly from the doctor straight into the Hulk, and back. If you want an action packed movie with an all around amazing experience, I would definitely recommend The Avengers to you.",10,1,7,12 February 2013
