Casablanca," Of course I remember this...
","What's left to say about this movie?  Along with a handful of films such as Some Like It Hot and the first two Godfather movies it is as close to perfection as a the movies get. Just watch the scene where Ingrid comes to Rick in the bar the night she comes to Casablanca.  The lighting is to die for, the dialogue is of the hard boiled Warner Bros kind and there is a score either by Max Steiner or Steiner like being played on the soundtrack.  And you know what?  The damn thing still works!",Null,0,0,20 August 2003
Monster," Outstanding casting...
","Extra kudos to casting director Feren Casalle.  Aside from the superlative breakthrough performance from Charlize Theron, there is also Christina Ricci as her lover.  This is a Ricci we've never seen.  More vibrant and alive than ever, also displaying a tough veneer that apparently goes down to the core as well.The film is chock full of terrific character actors, several who play the hapless (and in one case very deserving) victims of Aileen Wournos. Annie Corley is a standout as the woman to whom Selby (Ricci) is in charge of 'curing' her of her lesbianism.",Null,0,0,4 December 2003
The Godfather: Part II," Better than the first?
","I am one of those Godfather junkies (well at least the first two) who not only owns the DVD, but will stop to watch the movies every time I come across them while channel surfing. To be honest though, recently I am not as enthralled with The Godfather.  Over time, Part II has become a much better, richer movie going experience.  Not that there's anything wrong with The Godfather, I just happen to prefer this one.  I think that it paint a broader canvas thanks in part to jumping between the two stories.
There are just so many wonderful scenes.  The film starts off with the story of how Vito Corleone came to America.  This part of the movie is in Sicilian and even shot on location in Sicily.  Then we jump to the 50's and the confirmation of Anthony, Vito's grandson.  Like the wedding in the first one, we get an idea of who the main players are going to be.  One of my favorite shots in this part is when Fredo's tramp wife meets Connie's gigolo fiance.  Coppola cuts to a shot Mama Corleone saying something to Consigliori Tom Hagen in Sicilian.  it is a brief shot, not more than 2 or 3 seconds but you get an idea of the relationship between them.  This is of interest to me as a Godfather obsessive since in the original novel, it is noted that the adopted Hagen never thought of Mama Corleone as a mother nor were they particularly close.  This shot shows how in the enusing years since her husband's death how they developed a bond.There is so much good in this movie to rave about.  Coppola apparently loves commerative events: the wedding reception in the first movie, the aforementioned confimation party (which of course has little to do with the confirmation and everything to do with Michael's power) and New Year's in Cuba.While we may remember the big scenes, there are also some wonderful simple scens just between two characters: Michael's visit to Hyman Roth in Miami, his drink with Fredo (a banana daquiri?) in Cuba, Kaye's leaving Michael ('this Sicilian thing') and Tom's final meeting with Frankie Pantangelo. All these scenes are written with wonderful, intelligent dialogue accompanied by solid acting.",Null,0,1,11 August 2003
Seabiscuit," trotting down the oscar road to perdition...
","An OKAY movie.  I liked it, but it didn't grip me in a tidal wave of emotion.  Director Gary Ross failed in that regard in that I never got a sense of the excitement that supposedly surrounded Seabiscuit back in the thirties.  The more I think about, the more the backstories on the main characters seemed unecessary. It's August and I think the movie will be like last year's summer Oscar movie, The Road to Perdition and will be only nominally remembered at Oscar time. I don't think that this will be the movie to bring Jeff Bridges his trophy.",Null,0,0,14 August 2003
Schindler's List," Why is it brilliant?
","It's been asked, how could anyone not make a deeply moving movie about this subject? There may be a basis for that question, but what Spielberg did was also make a piece of amazing piece of film-making. Despite his phenomnal successes, it seems as if he was hiding his hand at what depths he could demonstrate. After years of awing and amazing us, he now had the skills and power to deliver a most potent work.To be honest, I haven't seen it since it's initial release. Yet, what I do remember is that Spielberg was able to make a three hour film on the Shoah and make it move a brisk pace without letting up on its impact. That's why it is brilliant.",Null,9,13,1 December 2004
There's Something About Mary," Hard to top...even for the Brothers Farelley!
","I chose There's Something About Mary to be the first movie that I am going to review here on IMDb.  To me, it is a near perfect comedy that ranks up there with such all time greats as Some Like It Hot and Airplane.  What really makes this movie work though is the first rate acting by the cast. Cameron Diaz actuall received the New York Film Critics Award for Best Actress and deservedly so.Just catch the moment at the end when she catchers her good friend and neighbor Magda eating a banana split.  Diaz does a great double take when it dawns on her that Magda has just slept with an old sailor. (Earlier in the movie, Magda tells her that after sex, she always has to have a banana split.)Magda, played by Lynn Shaye is fantastic.  Magda is supposed to be a dried oversexed leathery skinned 50-something who is way too much in love with her dog, Puffy.  She even tells Mary (Diaz, duh!) that if Puffy likes a prospective suitor, then he's 'a keeper.'  Shay here herself was at least 25 years younger than her character, but she plays her so well that most people were surprised to see that it was the make up and good acting.
Of course there's Ben Stiller and Matt Dillon leading the charge of Mary's suitors.  Stiller is quite game for all that he goes through in this movie and pulls it off.  Dillon, who for years was one of the most handsome guys in film, turns himself into a seedy looking...and acting private dick (and you can use that word in both its meanings here).The movies' most famous scene is the hair gel scene.  However, when I saw it for the second time in the theatre in '97, the scene that was even funier was when Puffy went Psycho on Stiller.Indeed, this is a true comedy classic that is hard to top. So hard, that the Fareelley Brothers subsequent movies have been abysmal outings.  Here, the low brow humor comes naturally out of the situation recalling the old line that it isn't in bad taste if you laugh at it.",Null,0,1,11 August 2003
Some Like It Hot," the fuzzy end of the lolly pop
","Great movie, great performances,great script, great filmaking.  Why try to analyze it?  So many great lines throughout...'You must be the new girls!' 'Brand news.''I thought you girls said that you were at the conservatory for four years?' 'We got time off for good behavior.''Mother doesn't like girls that smoke.''The old Shell game''Mine's a rich millionaire.' A non-recurring phenomona if there ever was one.",Null,1,3,20 August 2003
Ben-Hur," Hollywood craftsmanship at its best
","For some reason William Wyler doesn't always seem to get the respect that he deserves.  This man did all.  He could handle the divas from Bette to Barbra, the tough guys like Bogie, the wartime homefront dramas such as The Best Years of Our Lives and the nearly forgotten Mrs Miniver.A lot of movies seem to drag on and on, not knowing when to stop, making 90 mintues to 2 hours seem double.  Even while watching them you can see what is just excess and should have been trimmed.  Not Ben Hur.  At three hours and forty five minutes, there isn't a wasted frame in the whole thing. Credit that to Mr Wyler.",Null,2,5,20 August 2003
