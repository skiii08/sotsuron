Walk the Line," Overpraised Acting Performance by Joaquin Phoenix
","Joaquin Phoenix got much praise for his role as Johnny Cash in Walk The Line - a chick flick masquerading as a biopic of Johnny and June Carter Cash. His performance - one of the rare instances of a well-deserved Oscar snub - is certainly one of the most overrated in film history. In addition to looking absolutely nothing like Johnny Cash, he fails to sound or act like him as well.His attempts to impersonate Cash's baritone singing style were noble, but Cash was one of the most gut-wrenching of singers in popular music. He conveyed his feelings and emotions through his voice both live and in the recording studio, and was a tremendous storyteller in addition to being a singer and musician. Phoenix, unfortunately, was completely unable to tap into this aspect of the man and his music. Also, as captured in the recordings 'Live At Folsom Prison' and 'At San Quentin', Cash was a rather mellow individual when interacting with his appreciative audience of inmates. When the landmark Folsom gig is reenacted at the film's conclusion, Cash is depicted as wild and unhinged - almost as if his motivation for performing at the prison was to start a riot. Cash most certainly was a rebellious individual, but to depict him in a manner such as this is dishonest and irresponsible on behalf of the actor portraying him and the filmmaker, to say the least.The movie's sole redeeming quality is the fine performance by Reese Witherspoon as the love of John's life, June Carter. Unlike Phoenix, she succeeds in capturing the charm as well as capably mimicking the singing style of the late performer.Walk The Line is a slick Hollywood production which will surely satisfy the Lifetime movie-of-the-week crowd. But true fans of Johnny Cash and his music will be disappointed as it does not give the legend and his legacy the proper respect that is deserved.",6,1,4,12 February 2009
Terminator Salvation," 'I Won't Be Back'
","At one point while suffering through Terminator 4 in the theater, I thought: 'Maybe these people getting waterboarded don't have it so bad'. Terminator: Salvation is a stunning train wreck of a movie. While watching, you think back to Christian Bale's leaked meltdown in which he went off on the Director of Photography, and you begin to sympathize with the actor. The thought of signing up to appear in this disaster has the potential to inflict serious damage on his star power in Hollywood. What has happened to the Bale of American Psycho and The Machinist? The flashes of brilliance he showed in those films have all but disappeared, and now appears to be a serious contender for a razzie. Don't believe the 'we were filming a very serious scene' excuse. This is a film about Robots fighting each other. Bale must realize the intention of appearing in mindless summer fare such as this is to not try and one up Brando In The Godfather.Director 'McG' apparently felt it would be a good idea to make T4 seem like a ripoff of The Tranformers. This 'director' may think he has a hip moniker, but his approach to this material is anything but. Bale will most likely look back on this experience as the bad decision which drove him to suffer an emotional breakdown, where he assaulted family members and lashed out at co-workers. Hopefully more audio recordings surface, because I can assure you he was going off Glengarry Glen Ross style on people behind the scenes every chance he got, and I cannot blame him. Hearing those would no doubt be 100,000 times more entertaining than the steaming piece of excrement called T4 - the franchise-killing finale to a once great science-fiction series.'I Won't Be Back' Ah-nuld may as well have said during his CGI-ed cameo.",1,3,6,24 June 2009
Taxi Driver," Scorsese's First Masterpiece
","Taxi Driver is a groundbreaking and classic film, showcasing DeNiro's brilliant performance of Travis Bickle which in my opinion tops that of La Motta in Raging Bull. DeNiro plays the ultimate loner and violent psychopath in Taxi Driver, yet he displays enough charisma causing the viewer to care for this unsavory character he portrays. This is a rare feat for an actor to accomplish. Given Paul Schrader's screenplay refrains from resorting to manipulative clich√© to generate sympathy for an unsavory main character like Bickle. Robert DeNiro deserved the best actor Academy Award for this film. Scorsese's direction is immaculate. The 'Late For The Sky' sequence is a prime example of the depth DeNiro puts into his performance, conveying so much about the character he is playing without saying a single word. Harvey Keitel is very good as Bickle's foil, Sport. Foster is terrific playing a kid who is more wise to the ways of the world than Travis. Taxi Driver is flawless. A Character study of a troubled & lonely individual who feels ignored by society and driven crazy by his surroundings of urban decay. Bickle feels the only way he will ever get noticed by the girl he adores is by becoming a vigilante. This he feels will get Betsy to notice him. Travis feels he is making a difference by cleansing the city of unsavory elements and rescuing a 12 year old prostitute from her pimp, Sport, and his accomplices. The film which was made in 1976 showed a dark underbelly of society in America which still holds true today. More than ever in fact. Taxi Driver is a comment on society. Too often in the news you hear of disturbed and psychologically damaged people who obviously feel leaving their imprint on society through a shocking outburst of violence is the only way to get noticed. Bernard Herrmann's memorable score fits the mood of the film perfectly. Michael Chapman's cinematography is perfection. The debated controversial ending is open to interpretation. When Bickle is Driving Betsy in the cab. Thus ultimately one of the many brilliant aspects of Taxi Driver, without giving too much away. A thought-provoking and fascinating cinematic experience. Taxi Driver deserves it's well-deserved reputation as a masterpiece. 'He's a walking contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction'. - Kris Kristofferson",10,0,0,21 November 2010
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Flop Hard: The John C. Riley SUCKS Story
","This is a review of the commercial advertisements for this pathetic looking piece of garbage, since I have not seen Walk Hard: The Dewy Cox Story. Never will I see it as a matter of fact. Since the ads for this crap were torture to sit through, I doubt highly I would ever consider wasting my time or money and see the actual film. While John C. Reily may be an adequate dramatic supporting actor, he is not a lead actor and he certainly has no flair for comedy. For whatever reason, Apatow seems bent on reinventing this guy as the new Will Ferrel. Hopefully Walk Hard's disastrous and pathetic showing at the box office will put a stop to this crusade. The 40 Year Old Virgin was far from a great movie, but the funny and talented Steve Carrell made it work. John C. Reilly, to put it bluntly, SUCKS as a comedic actor and has no timing whatsoever.To sell a feeble attempt for a movie such as Walk Hard to a fickle public, you need a guy like Carrell or Jim Carrey to anchor it. Everything about this production seems like it was destined to fail from the get-go.To make matters worse, an article brought to my attention around the time the movie was released where Apatow boatsed about the loads of naked male genitalia was was displayed prominently in the film (no pun intended). Thanks for the warning, Judd, but I already was planning on avoiding this movie like the plague.Anyone who would even waste their time giving something like Walk Hard a chance, you seriously have to wonder about. I have nothing against those who are attracted to their same gender, but if a movie shows excessive naked penis I am going to skip it. That's just me.",1,7,16,22 March 2008
I Am Legend," Will Smith battling aliens. . .again.
","Will Smith continues his streak of bad, practically unwatchable series of films where the premise has to do with him battling aliens. Apparently, people seem to enjoy this formula because this movie made a lot of money.I must admit that while I could not sit through this movie in it's entirety, I saw enough of it to say confidently that it was horrible. Independence Day is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Men In Black was extremely overrated. I, Robot: I could also not sit through. Part of the problem with these films is that Smith plays up his comedic, likable guy personality so much that it is practically impossible to take the brink of apocalypse storyline seriously. But the main flaw with Smith's sci-fi / action vehicles is: they bring nothing new to the table. They all seem like badly made hack jobs by filmmakers and screenwriters who are walking the fine line between originality and plagiarism.Maybe one of these days, Smith will get a script involving him fighting aliens that will actually bring something original to the genre. But I'm not holding my breath. The success of I Am Legend ensures you can expect more of the same.",1,2,5,19 March 2008
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Yes, The Critics Are Correct, Sir.
","This movie is terrible. Mind-numbing, insulting, headache-inducing. 2 1/2 hours of intermittent racial humor which may not have been so offensive had it not been presented in such a stereotypical matter. Transformers 2 almost seems like the purpose of it's existence is to set the civil rights movement back by a half century at least.Meggan Fox is an attractive woman, but come on. Is she worth sitting through 2 1/2 hours of loud, ear-punishing mind-numbing annoyance? Afraid not. This movie is a continuous violent assault on all senses. Especially taste.Transformers 2: bad, and not in a good way. But at least it has already out grossed T4, which was nothing more than a ripoff of the first mediocre 'Transformers'.Transformers 2 is a movie which should be studied in film school as a case in point for how to make a terrible movie. The spectacular opening weekend box office unfortunately indicates more films attempting to copy this bad formula are to come. A Sad comment.",1,19,41,28 June 2009
There Will Be Blood," There Will Be Overrated Praise From Critics
","Lewis hams it up in his Oscar winning role as Daniel Plainview. His performance is truly phenomenal. But unfortunately, this is all TWBB has going for it. There is simply not a rich enough storyline to justify the film's close to 3 hour running time. Plainview comes across as a boorish, manipulative hustler in the first 2/3rds of the film. Not until the film's final act does Lewis get to go full throttle and act like an unpredictable sadistic madman. Loosely based on Upton Sinclair's 'Oil', the title of the film is misleading to say the least. I've seen more blood in the average Nip/Tuck episode. To the film's credit, the cinematography and set design are superb.Paul Dano plays twin brothers in the movie who befriend and cross Plainview. I did not know these were supposed to be two separate characters until I read an article about the film after I saw it. Paul Thomas Anderson is hardly the cinematic auteur critics would have you believe. On the plus side, this is clearly PTA's most accomplished work thus far. At least he didn't try ripping off Scorsese's GoodFellas (Boogie Nights) and Altman's Short Cuts (Magnolia) this time around.Long story short, There Will Be Blood shows PTA has grown slightly as a moviemaker and story teller. DDL confirms the notion he is one of the greatest actors of his generation. But that is where the praise begins and ends. TWBB is not the work of a gifted filmmaker, and is surely not one of the best movies of the year.As a side note, I fail to understand why the MPAA gave this an R classification. This film could very reasonably have been rated PG-13.",6,8,16,22 March 2008
The Reader," Overrated Oscar-bait Garbage
","After having seen The Reader, I found myself in a state of shock, amazement, and disbelief that the same film I had just wasted 2 hours of my life on had been recipient of so many awards, as well as having the seemingly unanimous admiration of film critics lavished upon it.The lovely and talented Kate Winslet stars as a secretary for a high-ranking Nazi Officer who years later will end up on trial for her role as an accomplice for many of the heinous crimes committed by her despicable low-life employer.What ensues is an odd mix to be sure: a statement on Pro-literacy, an art house period piece, soft-core titillation, and a Holocaust/WW II epic. It unfortunately fails with all four.In the film, Winslet's character carries on a torrid affair with a young man. Capitalizing on the well-known fact that Winslet is not shy in front of the camera, there are several explicit sex scenes featuring a fully nude Winslet - as is the case with countless previously released films in which she stars. I am no prude, but Winslet appears to be long past the point of being typecast in this type of role. Nothing wrong with that, but it has now reached a point where if she appears in a film in which her breasts are not bared, people in the audience may be asking for their money back.Winslet is most certainly a fine actress, but the abundance of praise she has received for her turn in 'The Reader' is mind-boggling to say the least. She has given far better performances in just about everything else I've seen her in.Without question the sole motivation for any studio greenlighting material such as this are for Oscars. As a film fan and Oscar telecast viewer, it is rather disappointing to see the clout of Big Hollywood producers strong-arming the Academy year after year so exercises in mediocrity like 'The Reader' monopolize the nominations in big categories. To see superior films such as 'The Wrestler' and 'Gran Torino' get snubbed in the top category is a real shame for movie fans.Time would be much better spent reading a book for 2 hours than seeing this garbage.Three stars for Kate, one star for Ralph Finnes portraying the boy as an adult, ZERO for the film.",4,21,42,21 February 2009
The Wrestler," 'Burning The Candle At Both Ends'
","I can't really expand much on what hasn't already been said in regards to this critics darling of a film. What I can add is the final scene where Randy The Ram gets on the top turnbuckle and you see genuine tears streaming from his eyes had quite an impact on me. I sat stunned in the theater as the ending credits rolled and Bruce Springsteen's inspired title song played on the soundtrack, realizing I had just gone through a gut-wrenching emotional cinematic experience.What sets aside The Wrestler from the rest of the pack is that it evokes these emotions from the viewer not through manipulative clich√©d plot twists by the screenwriter, but from the performances. Rourke has always been a great actor, and this could quite possibly go down as his greatest role. But Marisa Tomei is a real heartbreaker in this film. Her performance of Cassidey is much more than a T&A role. You feel Randy The Ram's emotional turmoil as his heart gets yanked around by her continuously. As a single mother, Cassidey understandably devotes what little free time she has to providing her young son with the love and support she likely did not have growing up. Naturally, Cassidey fights her emotions toward Randy not much unlike like The Ram grappling with a fellow roid-abusing opponent before a few hundred hardcore wrestling metal maniacs at a local high school gym every Saturday night.The Ram achieved great success in the world of professional wrestling. In the late 80's, he was at the top of his game. 20 years later, the game is different. There are hardcore matches involving barbed wire, shattered glass, and staple guns. Younger athletes who looked up to the Ram when they were kids are now his competitors in the ring. But The Ram is a jack of very few trades. He must get a day job behind the deli counter at a supermarket to get out of the financial hole he dug himself into. His deteriorating health is an issue, but after damaging his relationship with his daughter beyond repair, and given up on a could-be relationship with Cassidy, The Ram makes a conscious decision to continue doing what he loves and does best. Much has been said about the parallels between Randy The Ram and Rourke, the actor. This could very likely be what makes the movie a success. A shrewd gamble which paid nice dividends for Aronofsky - certainly one of the brightest young filmmakers out there today. Evan Rachel Wood capably holds her own sharing the frame with a powerhouse like MR. A bright future for this young actress should she avoid an alcohol and drug-induced meltdown like so many other hot young starlets.Rourke and Tomei may not have walked home with Oscar gold, but their outstanding performances in The Wrestler will be immortalized in cinematic history forever.",10,5,7,19 April 2009
Casino," The Destruction Of A Criminal Empire - 70's Style
","When released in 1995, Casino was dismissed by many as Scorsese attempting to remake his own GoodFellas. But the movie, although quite similar to GoodFellas in many respects, stands on it's own. A most fast-paced 3 hour movie containing no unnecessary tedious scenes to slow it down, never failing at any opportunity to fascinate and entertain the viewer. Enter Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, a brilliant sports handicapper who takes his talents to Vegas. Ace's uncommon expertise and success with making the world of gambling pay off naturally attracts the wrong type of people in the likes of old hometown buddy now heavily connected with the Mob Nicky (Joe Pesci), and the romantic object of his affection Ginger (Sharon Stone). Sam unfortunately takes a gamble on these two and the results don't pay off as well as he would have liked. Neither Ace or Nicky are a match for Ginger, who gets in between them and ultimately plays them both for a couple of tricks.One of the film's remarkable achievements is how expertly the story is told, and Scorsese's ability to cram so many rich details into such a short amount of screen time frequently throughout. An example of this is where DeNiro's character catches on to a couple of card players using a sophisticated cheating technique so they can communicate with one another morse code style to inform each other of their opponents' playing cards which they can see from opposing tables. The way Scorsese can illustrate such rich details during a brief montage showing how the players are able to incorporate this scam to the beat of the Jeff Beck Group's 'I Ain't Superstitious' is like watching a master teaching a free class to show how it's done for other director-wannabes.Casino also of course features fine performances from the cast - many of whom also actually happened to appear in GoodFellas. Watch for a clever nod to Frank Vincent's 'Billy Batts' role in GoodFellas towards the film's conclusion.A masterpiece in direction, film editing, and storytelling, Casino contains scenes which may be considered by some as excessively violent, and must also hold some sort of record for the amount of 'F' words ever said in a film. Literally every line of dialog contains the word or variations on it. The easily offended may want to steer clear.Certainly one of the great films in the Scorsese canon which makes for a fine companion piece for his groundbreaking classic GoodFellas. I hope Scorsese makes one final mobster film with DeNiro and Pesci. Casino proves that, as far these three are concerned, you can't get much better of a combination as far as movies go. Should my wish come true, hopefully Mr. Scorsese can find another classic rock song to put on the soundtrack to fit the mood of the story besides 'Gimme Shelter' - also featured prominently in GoodFellas and The Departed.",10,1,1,23 March 2009
