Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Neat movie - Fun and entertaining
","Not as earth shattering as Episode IV, but still lots of fun. The pod race scene was amazing. The lightsaber duel between obi-wan kenobi, qui-gon jinn, and darth maul was one of the best cinematic style sword fights to be found. (Though, alas, not as good as princess bride)",7,4,6,19 May 1999
