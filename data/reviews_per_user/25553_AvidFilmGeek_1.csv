The Perks of Being a Wallflower," One of the best films of 2013.
","It defiantly deserves more recognition. Stephen Chbosky's book is a critically acclaimed book, but the movie did live up to his book, seeing as he wrote, produced, directed etc. Logan Lerman as Charlie was amazing. I saw this at the cinema straight after I re watched Percy Jackson & The Lightning Thief, and I don't think there's a role he can't pull off ie. Jack & Bobby when he was just a teenager, 3:10 to Yuma, and he was also very believable in Riding in Cars with Boys. Ezra Miller was also wonderful, he made you laugh, and he made you cry, and his character was so beautiful written. I've never seen a full Harry Potter film, but what I've seen of Emma Watson in them and in this film, she's a wonderful actress.I highly recommend it, one of the best films I've ever seen.",10,0,0,19 January 2014
