Casablanca," Great movie...
",I have seen this movie before at different times but I was never able to watch the entire thing in one sitting after watching this movie in its entirety I realized that the movie is even better then what I thought it would be it has lots of action drama love story and most of all different tricks and traps throughout the entire thing for the budget that this film had it definitely became a great movie and a classic of all times.. I definitely recommend watching this movie 2ne1 that enjoys a good action and suspense movie more on the suspense side then action side but definitely a worthwhile movie to sit down and watch with you're better have a group of friends or even yourself.. phenomenally made movie would love to watch it again sometime...,9,0,1,2 March 2016
Citizen Kane," Good movie.
",Was very confused about this movie throughout the entire movie not easily lost with certain things that were happening maybe I should have paid better attention and I possibly could have understanded it more from what I did understand it was a well made movie and great acting throughout the entire movie this movie could resemble certain people to this day to where they came from little and built an empire around themselves with their hard work and hard work from other people could not fathom having 496 people living in my house with me but while they were there for was to take care of me and my wife that would be completely insane in my book but none the less this was a very good movie and great acting the picture was also of good quality and it was great to see the many different features throughout the movie including the statues that he had brought in to furnish his house,8,1,2,16 February 2016
Pulp Fiction," Good movie.
",Very well made movie great acting there were many different plot twists and turns in the movie. I personally myself did not like the movie I thought it was very dull and to not make sense at times many other people find it amazing and a great movie but that is why we all have different tastes and likes when it comes down to movies music Exedra. The director of this film is usually not one of my favorite that could possibly be why I do not enjoy the movie as much as other people have it was a well made movie with lots of great acting and lots of famous actors and actresses. A lot of the story just made no sense to me on why they would do certain things or why they were acting in certain ways that they were like I said this movie was not for me but I know many people out there have really enjoyed it throughout the years.,8,1,2,25 February 2016
Psycho," Great movie...
",A classic movie will always be a classic movie and in this case with the movie psycho it is a classic and always will be. The plot the action and all the expense that was put into this movie at such an early time when movies were just taking shape and form this was an amazing movie to produce. This movie shows many traits that people feel show or portray themselves to be now a days in the way some people carry their lives with or without a disability. This movie shows hatred greed envy acceptance lying cheating and stealing all in one movie it is an amazing classic that I have seen before and I am glad that I got to see it again and relive the excitement of the Bates Motel and psycho..,9,1,2,22 February 2016
