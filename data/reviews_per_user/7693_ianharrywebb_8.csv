Lucky Number Slevin," Great Film great cast
","At last a film for adults and not American teenage boys.This has a plot which keeps you guessing and with the occasional flash back helps keep the viewer up to speed on what is going on story wise.No car chases, just a story unfolding with a large cast and subplots a film for adults. The tale being told is not hard to follow but keeps you wondering what is about to happen next. This film keeps you entertained throughout. Great acting with witty dialogue a good score a truly marvelous film.Bruce Willis {Goodcat aka Smith} Morgan Freeman {Boss} Josh Hartnett {Slavin} Lucy Lui {Girl next door} Drama/Action/Thriller with some comedy.This is well worth seeing one of the best films I have seen in a long while. EXCELLENT!",10,3,11,6 April 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Wonderful: Great entertainment; Good fun for the family
","Same actors that are in the first: this is just as good; great fun, very funny. I went right back in to see it again. And yes I will go and see it again.I'm looking forward to seeing the third when its released next year.I'll be buying the DVD too when it comes out.I have only NOW watched the second DVD disc of the first picture. Yo Ho Ho and a bottle of RUM! Yeah I even bought a bottle of rum to drink while I watched it. And learned a lot about real pirates.If you loved the first you are going to love love love the second. If your someone who has not seen the first film you may be wondering why the rest of the audience are laughing. Never mind its still a fun film for the first timer. Pirates is the Indiana Jones films for the 21st Century. I bet that children of all ages are now queuing to see Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disney. That's fine it was fun too and I could not work out why it was so easy to get on it. Then it came to me, no film! Ah clever people at Disney hope it works for them because the ride like the films deserves success.Jokes a plenty based on the first film. And having watched the DVD I noticed characters and events from the Disney park adventure. But it don't matter it works its fun its ENTERTAINING.Roll out the barrel of rum roll out the next Pirates of the Caribbean film number 3.They have filmed 2 & 3 back to back and looked like they had just as much fun making the 2 & 3 as they did making the first film and more important we enjoy it also.",10,2,5,6 July 2006
Black Book," A Great Spy / Resistance film from the Dutch.
","This story is based on true events. September 1944 to April 1945 in the Netherlands. Its in Dutch so its subtitled.Its all about the Dutch resistance in W.W.II. As seen for one Jewish woman's point of view and what she must do to resist the German occupation. Its a boy's own adventure story and soon we are on an adventure at a fast pace on who is good and who is a traitor. With no Americans in the cast and not an American uniform in sight it allows people to know that others were involved in the war long before help arrived. I hope this movie does well in the USA because it deserves to be. Young men and women will enjoy the chase and love angle with fight scenes throughout the film. So you have to read subtitles, well they never spoke English to each other get over it. This war movie should not escape you its fun. Its shot like a Hollywood film like days long gone don't miss it!",9,9,13,20 January 2007
The Da Vinci Code," ***I loved the film I enjoyed it I would see it again.***
","Well I have just come in from seeing the fi-lum and I thought it was very good. I enjoyed it! I enjoyed it so much I have now seen it three times, I will be buying the DVD.Just to think Tom Hanks stood in my foot steps when in Scotland. No shots of Edinburgh. Still Roslyn seven miles south of Edinburgh Scotland looks great inside and out.I like the book also. So its not Charles Dickens so the fi-lum is not Gone With the Wind. Its a good thriller like the Thirty Nine Steps man gets murdered: man goes on the run; man seeks answers, mystery solved. Puzzles to be solved, now the holy of holies what on earth was the Maltese Falcon all about and does it matter? Its a good film too. Like the Da Vinci Code.Nothing wrong with the fi-lum but as always the book is always better, but at 603 pages its shortened for the cinema. I'll give it seven and a half out of ten Its no more far fetched than Mission Impossible. Well more believable actually. Any changes from the novel are for the better in my opinion.I simply can't see what the critics have a problem with, hell its just a movie people like the Thirty Nine Steps. What the critics loved was BRICK which was lousy. God now that was a waste of money. Seems to me if the critics love it; I will hate it; if they don't like it I will love it, and most of the paying cinema going public would agree with me. Rather than the snobs who don't even pay for the price of admission.Yes I recommend the Da Vinci Code to everyone who likes a good thriller. Its faction {part fiction part fact} like any Fredrick Forsyth novel. Dan Brown only took some true facts some true history and wrote a fictional story a thriller which makes a very good film. D.Brown did not write the historical facts! Facts are facts history happened or it did not, he only took the historical facts with some myths and added a fictional story. No one attacks Christian beliefs. Who cares if Opus Dei does not have monks? Who cares if the pyramid has 666 panes of glass or 669 its fiction. The Vatican is not attacked. Robert Langdon does say the Priory of Sion was a hoax. 'That's what they want you to believe'. If people can't follow the unfolding story its because they have the attention span of a goldfish.Its not in my opinion if you have faith but do you have faith in what old men wrote hundreds of years after Christs death?. This is not a theology documentary but a fictional story and a damn fine story at that. See the movie and enjoy the story its very very good. Only the MTV 30 second attention span generation would have a problem and those who can't read subtitles. French people speak french to each other and not English. _____________________________",8,0,3,20 May 2006
The Last King of Scotland," The Great Whitaker is Idi. Give him his Oscar!
","Forest Whitaker walks tall through out this film, a part he was born to play. James McAvoy tries hard to keep up. And Jillian Anderson is under used. With McAvoy's character based on three or four people this story is seen from his point of view about Uganda's dictator. The good Scottish Doctor goes to Uganda with good intentions and to escape his repressive father. But when there he meets Idi Amin and is first captivated, sucked in then horrified when the truth starts to dawn on him that the child like Idi, is dangerous very dangerous. Young and naive Dr Garrigan {James McAvoy} not a bad person by any-means, but enjoying being on the inside and living a great lifestyle. Garrigan just needs his eyes opened before he too loses his own life. The charismatic Idi Amin is a madman and cruel to his people. The sad thing is that those things did happen but not all to one Dr Garrigan, that part is fiction. One should go and see this film for an Oscar performance from Forest Whitaker. I hope he wins it!",8,3,4,27 January 2007
Music and Lyrics," One could do worse than see this on a date on Valentine's Day
","Its not great its not bad its okay. Both actors play themselves as they are often seen in other films. But then so does Robert Redford and Cary Grant it did them no harm and one does know what one is getting.So we have Hugh Grant playing to type and Drew Barrymore doing the same. Where this could have been great with Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn set in the 40s. This set in 2006 does not quite come up to par. That is not to say its not worth seeing and it does have its moments. This is no Notting Hill the DVD will not sell much but that said its a boy gets girl boy loses girl rom-com. The stars do their best with what they are given and Hugh Grant's pop video is not half bad, a parody on 80s pop videos. But why on earth anyone needs someone to water a few plants in a flat beats me. Anyway its a movie so anything is possible crazy but clever girl meets past pop star and write a pop song and find love. Yeah Right!Go not expecting very much and you may really enjoy it. Stay for the credits its funny.",5,1,4,12 February 2007
V for Vendetta," Great fun great film thought provoking with cool music.
","As I write V for Vendetta is number 3 in the top 10 films this week, it should be number 1. This is without a doubt the best film in the list in my view.Its well written: a drama with action and not a car chase in sight. V is out for revenge, and to make the people aware that all is not right in the UK with its far right government not telling the truth on news broadcasts. Our antihero V speaks English which makes a change for any masked man in movies.And its made in Britain which is also a change. This film stays with you long after you have come out the cinema and you can't say that about many films those days.V for Vendetta rocks I for one will be buying the DVD when it comes out, V for Vendetta is the top film in the USA who says the yanks can't make good choices?",10,2,4,31 March 2006
The Island," No one will pick up an Oscar. Who cares it was fun entertainment.
","Okay it well maybe not an original story, then how many are? Its as good as Batman better than the Fantastic Four its entertaining.Scarlett Johansson has been given a hard time for her playing in this film. Its unfair don't they get it she is only four years old? She plays innocence very well her character is childlike.Ewan McGregor 'I'm missing a shoe' 'Why is every one wearing white, why can't I have colour'? He did not receive an answer but at least he asked.Its just believable, a story set in the near future. I agree why do the guys set to capture them destroy everything to capture them? Perhaps because its a Hollywood movie aimed at teenage boys which is what most of Hollywood films are about, making money. But I'm glad they do its a fun and exciting ride. Lets face it this is what Hollywood is all about selling tickets. Hey people its a film entertainment BLOCKBUSTER not Goethe. I enjoyed it! I just enjoyed the ride and left my brain switched off. Its far better than what the critics say it is. And you can waste your money on far far worse films out there. It is not going to win any Oscars but then that goes for 98% of those on release. All those who played even a small part played them well, one could argue the film pays homage to all those SI-FI films that came before. 7 out of 10",7,1,2,23 August 2005
