The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," One of the worst movies of all time
","Yes i read book, but i do not think this affected my opinion about the movie.Acting was terrible, i have no doubt that Jennifer Lawrance will be nominated for Razzie award for this terrible performance.Plot was insufferable and worst of all, the idea of cutting the movie into two part was just meaningless. Great Julianne Moore, even you can not save this bad, bad movie.Obviously, they extended so many line just to make sure that they have enough ''minutes'' to make a movie, that's why we watched so many boring dialog and so many bad acting.",1,30,44,2 December 2014
