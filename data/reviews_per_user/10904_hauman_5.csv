The Ring," Good remake
","The Ring will inevitably be compared to Hideo Nakata's original, and I'd say both end up about even, with tradeoffs between the various things they add or subtract. The original's snappier pace meant fewer indulgences in atmospherics, which are in full effect in the more leisurely remake; the backstory in Nakata's film is fairly airtight while Verbinski and screenwriter Ehren Kruger don't smooth over all of their narrative potholes. But what make both films work is the same: the creepy exploration of the unknown and unexplainable, which is far more frightening than the violent killings that typify most horror films, particularly ones that come out of the big studios this time of year.",Null,1,1,22 November 2011
The Exorcist," There's something new to be discovered in every viewing of The Exorcist.
","This decade's horror films have it all wrong. A person suddenly jumping out of a closet with a knife is not scary. Here is where any film seeking to chill its audience should take its cue. The Exorcist is genuinely frightening. It works so well because a) the atmosphere director William Friedkin sets up is pitch-perfect and b) we believe that these are real people being ravaged by these horrors. The special effects in this movie aren't particularly impressive but it doesn't matter. Regan's transformation from angel-faced little girl to mutilated, violent devil incarnate is done so well that we don't have time to notice any defect in the film's technical aspects. Mercedes McCambridge, who provides Regan's voice once she is completely inhabited is The Exorcist's unsung hero â€” her behind-the-scenes work provides some of the most chilling material found here.",Null,1,2,22 November 2011
Insidious," Good entertainment
","The Exorcist and Poltergeist are obviously films which have burrowed themselves into the minds of Wan and Whannell, and they have been reborn here into one chilling amalgamation, spurred on by a jarring, fractious musical score by Joseph Bishara, and a memorable performance by Lin Shaye, who plays a maternal but forceful spiritual medium with just the right tone and energy.But Insidious also proves itself to be a genuine entry in the demonic possession film canon. A unique séance sequence is both berserk and entertaining, while the use of astral projection is a feature rarely used in horror movies, and perhaps for good reason, with the third act descending into silliness akin to a ghost ride set in an alternate dimension.",Null,1,1,22 November 2011
Departures," Meaningful
","It's a film of a young man's vocation that consists in spreading peace of mind and soul through the execution of an exquisite ritual. At the same time it is the story of a marriage before the birth of the first child and a young wife's discovery what an interesting husband she has found. Also, it shows the constructive effect of a good father figure on an otherwise lost soul. The film has many moving, sometimes explosive scenes and is, in the end, I do not know a better word, 'meaningful' in a mysterious way that cannot be described. I addresses and calms our fear of dying. The whole story is build around five mysterious ceremonies that contain and express what it means to be a human being.",Null,0,0,22 November 2011
The Descent," Remains with you for a while!
","There have been a lot of comparisons to 'Alien', but 'Descent' is more like 'Jaws' in a cave. The makers understands that it's what you don't see that's scary. And in a cave, it's easy to not see. You thought you were afraid to go in the water? You may never go spelunking again. Of course, unless you're already a cave-diver, it might be a bit hard to relate to these characters. I mean, really, what are you doing in that cave to begin with?Above all else, I appreciate what 'The Descent' is attempting to do. It's not one of those obvious slasher films that plague the multiplexes when Hollywood's out of ideas. There are plenty of false scares (mostly the old dream sequence trick), but also plenty of real ones. 'The Descent' may not be a classic, but it's likely to remain with you for a while.",Null,0,2,22 November 2011
