Hereditary," the best horror movie of the last 10 years
","An absolutely terrifying, original, aesthetically beautiful and very psychologically disturbing film. impressive performances and absolutely brilliant direction, well thought out and constructed script, made perfectly to give terror to the audience and be unpredictable, all i can say is that it is undoubtedly perfect",10,1,4,14 August 2019
It Follows," an original and refreshing movie
","This movie has extremely spooky moments and its pauses between them are moving enough and full of suspense to keep you entertained and hooked, it is very original and a very good distance to the conventional, this is how a horror movie should be made, slow, leisurely, and without ever abandoning good music and cinematography (which are great and give you an incredible atmosphere).
David Robert Mitchell's script and direction is amazing and I am impressed by his ability to make us empathize with the protagonist without even developing her too much, the performances are also phenomenal but the one that impressed me most was Maika Monroe (the protagonist). a very good movie, it may not be for everyone but it is very good",8,0,2,6 October 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," a cinematic wonder
","Incredible performances, incredible direction, great script, all fantastic, the only thing to discuss is that it has somewhat slow pace, but that's it",9,9,21,14 August 2019
Joker," a fantastic and uncomfortable movie
","This movie is impressive, incredible and very well done, Todd Phillips offers us an incredible direction, aesthetically vibrant and masterful. The script is also very well done, it is uncomfortable and surprising and its performances are somewhat unimaginable, but Joaquin Phoenix steals the entire show, giving us an interpretation out of this world, 100% delivered to his role, highly recommended, go to see it",9,1,2,6 October 2019
It Chapter Two," enjoyable, funny, but less scary than the first
","It's faithfull to the book and that's good and that's why i think that, althought this movie is good, the first one is better. in the book, the adults part is the 'least interesting' and they try to make to make up it here, and they do it very good. i liked it a lot and the performances are very good, the direction is also very good and has its own style, but it's less scary and longer, you get tired in the last minutes, it is not a jewel but it is very good",7,1,3,6 September 2019
