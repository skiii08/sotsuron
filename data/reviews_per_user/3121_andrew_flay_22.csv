Batman Begins," Where it begins
","First of all i am a massive batman fan, batman is love, batman is life. I never heard of Christopher Nolan at first so i was a bit unsure, I remember going with my mother and father to watch this in the cinema, i was praying for a good batman film, as i think we have not had a good decent batman film yet.I remember getting goosebumps straight away with the WARNER BROS. PICTURES and the DC comics intro, The score in the background is the definite batman score in my opinion. I actually have the soundtrack on my phone, sad really.The All star cast in this is perfect, Christian Bale is a wonderful batman, Michael Caine Alfred is spot on, Gary Oldman Jim Gordon is brilliant, really shows how corrupt Gotham City is with his portrayal, I really liked the way young Bruce Wayne was played as well by Gus Lewis, his performance i found very powerful.I think Christopher Nolan got the essence right with this film we see a young Bruce Wayne Struggle With his inner demons, start his training to become the caped crusader, i will always remember Batman's first appearance, They don't see him coming, i think its my favorite scene from the film, brilliantly directed.Short Summary: This is a must see film if your a batman Fan, Batman isn't for just one generation, he's for every generation. ï»¿",10,0,0,26 August 2017

Silence," Interesting & repetitive
","Obviously Garfield & driver give amazing performances, it's a long film but I'd say it's worth a watch.
It's interesting for the whole question about religion how faith cripples the minds and how far people are willing to go, but my whole opinion & A BIG SORRY IN ADVANCE
religion is the worst thing that has come to our minds.",7,3,4,2 September 2019
Love Actually," Ok
","Only part of this film that made me laugh or happy were the rowan atkinson scenes which was not a lot of, apart from that it's an ok Christmas film.",5,0,3,22 December 2018
Joker," Send in the clowns!
","Just got home from Swansea vue cinema, it was full glad I booked the tickets online.
This film is outstanding the performance from Joaquin alone is mental his physical appearance is scary, his sheer laughter made me feel bad for him, you can tell he put a lot into this role.
I had goosebumps and felt terror at the same time at the part with his boss telling him to get the sign back his face and the score my goodness what a film.
I understand this film isn't for everyone but my goodness get on it, the visuals, the score and acting is beautifully haunting. I think dc have done right on this one. Get on it.",10,4,8,4 October 2019

The Iron Giant," Great film

The Greatest Showman," It's entertaining
","I don't normally do musicals, but as everyone has been raving about this film and all I hear on the radio is 'this is it' I enjoyed this film more than I expected too, my only down fall with this film is some of the songs do drag on a bit, maybe turn it down a notch.",7,2,4,9 September 2018
Alien: Covenant," Prometheus 2 basically
","Without further a due, this sequel to the prequel is a hard watch to start, once it gets rolling it gets a little better, thats why I rated it a 6 out of 10. The film is visually beautiful and the effects are some what good. It seems Ridley Scott keeps the suspense at bay with the little flicker of music which sounds somewhat familiar from the first alien film.",6,1,3,21 August 2017
