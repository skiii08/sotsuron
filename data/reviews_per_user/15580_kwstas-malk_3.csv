The Equalizer," nice action movie
","There is one side in the film when it's totally gripping, that is when we just see the protagonist as a person living in an ordinary life, often being with people and often encountering them getting in trouble by crime. This grounded world just keeps most of its darkness in their presence, sometimes feeling like a doomed, helpless world. But once the hero reveals what he truly is capable of, it doesn't actually sucks out its entertainment quality, but it does betrays that intriguing context, nearly turning itself into a superhero movie, except of course, it's less silly and much violent. McCall, in shorthand, is too competent for any criminal he fights and often leaves with a perfect swagger. It may not be big deal to many viewers, especially the action fans who are already enjoying the blood, but the film sets up an existing theme that seems to be a lot interesting to consider instead of indulging itself with its own way of justice. CLASSIC American HOLIHOOD FILM !",6,1,2,6 January 2015
Non-Stop," nice action movie
","In similar style to taken 1 and 2 this movie is a non stop action featuring Liam Neeson as the films hero. Overall it was very exciting and kept you guessing right up to the end. Most of the acting was on par with this style of movie, Liam Neeson gave the strongest performance. The story itself was very clich√© (e.g plane, terrorists, bomb, hero saves the day) but as far as typical action/thrillers go this one holds your attention throughout. It was a relief/refreshing to see that for once the terrorist in the film wasn't Arabic or eastern European. The main downside to the film was the ending which was very poorly acted and extremely cheesy. Still if you are looking for a film with intense action, a minimal story line and Liam Neeson kicking ass, then this is the movie for you.",7,0,1,11 January 2015
Mama," good movie
",I am a big fan of horror but recently i cant remember a movie which i enjoyed to my heart but then i saw MAMA and it was like a fresh air which u asked from a long long time. What makes MAMA special and different is it's Story and Acting.Not many horror movies has it now a days but MAMA has it all..a beautiful and emotional film with great horror elements to back it.The performance from Jessica Chastain is mind blowing.when the movie starts I didn't seem to connect with her character but as soon as the movie progressed she just blown my mind with her screen presence and screen fit performance.few places r just brilliant like the one where she finds lily outside of the house and she brings her in but Lily tries to escape but the she holds he tight and make her feel that she loves her from within and Lily starts looking at her with innocence and Jessica hold her hands blow air on them and ask Lily that 'dose she liked it'..it moved me and i was just speechless watching it.Just little more detailing would have turned it into a classic for life.but never then less its one of the finest horror film I watched in decades.,5,1,2,5 January 2015
