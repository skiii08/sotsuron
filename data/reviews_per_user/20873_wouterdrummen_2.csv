Blade Runner 2049," A visual masterpiece
","Let me start by saying that I am a huge Denis Villeneuve fan and absolutely love every movie he made, from his breakthrough drama 'Incendies' to the action thriller 'Sicario'. But when I learned that he was going to make a sequel to Ridley Scott's iconic Blade Runner I had mixed feelings. Would he be able to live up to the expectations and make a sequel that could measure itself with the original? For this reason, I went into the cinema thinking ''This will be a great movie, I am a Villeneuve fan so I have to like it'' but that was a mistake, for once I stopped expecting and just started experiencing the film, I was enchanted by all of its visual beauty. I was wrong to doubt Villeneuve; his 'Blade Runner 2049' even succeeds in transcending in some ways the original masterpiece, especially as a visual experience. The bleak dystopian future Scott so perfectly created is even more beautiful in Villeneuve's 2049, for which a lot of credit has to be given to the brilliant director of photography Roger Deakins, who has made one of his best works (which says a lot). Every shot is brilliant, I loved every single frame and I cannot imagine that he wouldn't get nominated and win an Oscar for this phenomenal work. But also a big thumbs up has to be given to the entire effects team, for Deakins didn't do it all on his own. Deakins isn't the only mastermind at work, for the score is also beautifully done. When I learned that composer Jóhann Jóhannsson (someone who has collaborated multiple times with Villeneuve and did most of the scores for his movies) got fired I was surprised; Jóhannsson has always delivered great work, but according to Villeneuve, his score ''wasn't the right one'' for this movie for it didn't ''resemble Vangelis soundtrack for Blade Runner'' quite enough. So he got replaced by probably the best man in the business nowadays; Hans Zimmer. And as we are used to with the German composer, this was once again sublime and a great homage to the original. Zimmer's 2049 score can be compared to his Dunkirk score, in a way that it unsettles us from the first chord and just as the Second World War movie, it keeps us on the edges of ours seats, especially during the last hour.As for the people who are actually situated in front of the camera, they all play their parts very well. I was especially happy that Ryan Gosling's agent K was indeed the leading man and he did a very good job. I was slightly concerned that it would mostly be about Harrison Ford's Deckard, but luckily that wasn't the case. Nevertheless, Ford gives one of his best performances in years and after all the iconic roles he played once again in recent years (Han Solo, Indiana Jones) this is by far the best. The smaller but important roles are also noteworthy; Robin Wright's Lieutenant Joshi makes a fierce and convincing police chief, while the villain duo Jared Leto's Neander Wallace as the evil head of a corporation at the top of the new world order and his frightening hit-woman Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) are also very impressive. Last but not least, Ana de Armas is also very good as Joi, K's girlfriend (even if she does remind me a lot of Scarlet Johansson in 'Her' and slightly of Alicia Vikander in 'Ex Machina', but maybe that's something Villeneuve did that on purpose and wanted to pay homage to these recent but also very good science-fiction movies).That said, Villeneuve will receive most of the credit, as he should. For unlike most of Hollywood's blockbusters nowadays, he doesn't simply deliver us a spectacle with some nice effects or a reboot of the original, but he picks up the threads where Scott left, which was a monumental task, for the original 'Blade Runner' is one of the most impressive and iconic movies ever made. 2049 continues on the same topics raised by the original, making the sequel worth the 35-year long wait; it goes further with what was proposed in the first installment, enriching one another. It is possible that one day a third installment could be made, but that is only if any director will ever find the courage to make another 'Blade Runner', for the bar is raised incredibly high. I believe that in time, 'Blade Runner 2049' will just as the original one, grow into a cult movie, and rightfully so, for it is its own movie, but, just as the original, a visually remarkable, achingly human sci-fi masterpiece. I am not going to say more about it, because the studio has been unusually insistent in its pleas to critics and the first movie viewers not to reveal any plot points, but I am glad they did. Even if I could go on and on about the movie and the difference between replicants and humans (or is there really much of a difference, after all?) the less you know the better, because 2049 feels at its best when it surprises (which is one of Villeneuve's greatest strengths). This is a movie best experienced on the biggest screen in your cinema; trust me, it will be worth your while. As for me, I will most likely try and make some free time in my schedule for the coming days, 'cause I want to go the cinema again, guess what I'm gonna watch...",10,631,1271,4 October 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," ''I'm a fan y'all!''
","Let me start by saying that I am no die-hard fan of either Marvel or DC Comics. Maybe that is also due to the fact that there's been an overkill of superhero flicks these last couple of years, but even then, most movie viewers have already chosen a side. I personally never knew if I preferred the light-headed and fun Marvel superhero movies or if I would rather go for the darker, grittier and more realistic DC movies. Then again, I have always done my best to like a DC movie, trying to convince myself that it was a good movie even when it was actually a disappointment (maybe because of my immense love for Nolan's The Dark Knight trilogy, but ever since the quality has drastically dropped). And although I never speak too highly of the Marvel superheroes either, I almost always enjoy myself, each and every time. But oh boy, did I love Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2! Volume 2 opens with one of the best CGI battles I have seen in any superhero movie, with the camera focusing on baby Groot, who dances on ELO's ''Mr. Blue Sky'', while the rest of the team fights against a kraken-like alien. From the beginning on it is clear that we are in for one groovy, swinging and fun movie, just like the first chapter. The movie doesn't take itself all too serious, but aims to be entertaining, which I believe is one of Marvel's major qualities anyway. But even the few flaws volume 1 had, they are mostly dealt with in volume 2.While Chris Pratt's Starlord/Peter Quill was without doubt the big star in the first movie, every other main character gets almost as much screen time as Starlord this time. They all get their moment to shine in vol. 2. Saldana's Gamora has established herself as the leader and the brains of the group, while Bautista's Drax is a clumsy but most amusing character. Cooper's Rocket is also phenomenal and knows how to kick ass, while Diesel's Baby Groot Well, it doesn't seem like an all too difficult job for Diesel, who only has to say 3 words throughout the entire movie, but what is there not to love about Groot? In the eyes of many, Groot only became a ''baby'' to maximize the merchandise sales, but you don't hear me complain. He certainly is more fun than he was in volume 1, and I am looking forward to finding out what shape he will have in the next chapter. Every character also gets more depth, which is very rare in most superhero movies.I can't say that I enjoyed every Marvel movie or character; when they killed off characters like Agent Coulson, Quicksilver and even at one given point Jackon's Nick Fury (even if it was only momentarily) I couldn't really care. Most of these characters were pretty shallow and their deaths or disappearances had few impact, if any at all. It's also pretty clear that some of the Avengers, like Iron Man and Captain America, are way more important than for instance Thor or Hawkeye. Guardians of the Galaxy 2 doesn't make this same mistake; they are a bunch of misfits that complete one another. Secondary characters, such as Gillian's Nebula or Rooker's Yondu, also play important and interesting roles, while in the first chapter they simply seemed like mere additions. Even newcomer Mantis, played by Klementieff, also plays an interesting part in volume 2, although I hope she can keep me entertained in the next movie, if she is still in it that is.While the Fast and Furious franchise always pretends to be all about family, after 8 movies, I still haven't grown attached to them and I don't think I ever will. But after only 2 Guardians movies, I am rooting for each and every one of them, and if one of them would leave the group for any reason, I would certainly regret it and miss the character's unique presence. Gunn has planned it extremely well, developing every character in the best possible way because you start to care for them. Even Kurt Russel's portrayal as the mysterious bad-guy is one of the better ones in the MCU (then again, that's not very difficult, seen the other Marvel villains) Where Ronan was defeated in a pretty lame dancing contest in Guardians 1, here we witness a truly epic battle, at the same time bad-ass and funny. The aging technique they used on him early on in the movie is also remarkably well done, while in Rogue One the same effect was used on Princess Leia and Governor Tarkin, but here it felt quite artificial and looked fake from time to time. In Guardians 2, the CGI is remarkably well done, every single scene in the film is a feast to watch. The attention to detail is incredible (with many Easter-eggs!), and I cannot recall any scene which I didn't enjoy.In my eyes it is certainly one of the best, maybe even the best Marvel movie I have seen. Entertaining, funny and even moving at some moments, I am looking forward to returning to this amazing universe. Just like Starlord, I don't need no living planet, just give me a Volume 3 which is as good as its predecessor and I'll be more than happy.",8,6,9,17 May 2017
