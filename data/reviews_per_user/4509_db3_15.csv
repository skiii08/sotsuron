E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Cute entertainment for the entire family.
","E.T.  **__  Sci-Fi / Family  Dir: Steven Spielberg Dee Wallace-Stone, Henry Thomas, Drew Barrymore In California, several children pool resources to protect a cute alien and help him return home. I believe 'cute' is the operative word here. Most of the action occurs outside at night, with fog wafting through for mood. There are definitely some memorable scenes, but there are also giant holes in the plot. Not the least of which was why was E.T. dying? And why did he recover? Such pickiness aside, the film is cute entertainment for the entire family. No explosions. One slow-speed car chase.",5,1,4,25 March 2002
We Were Soldiers," If you want to know what the VietNam war was really like, this is the film to see.
","WE WERE SOLDIERS  ***_  War Drama Mel Gibson, Madeleine Stowe, Greg Kinnear		In 1965, 350 US troops arrive by helicopter at Landing Strip X-Ray in VietNam. They soon learn they have landed virtually on the doorstep of 4000 North Vietnamese soldiers. The movie is based on Lt. Harold Moore's book about an actual event in the early days of US involvement in VietNam. Zillions of explosions, but explosions are not out of place here. It's very well done and believable. The film is extremely graphic in its depiction of the violence and futility of war. If you want to know what the VietNam war was really like, this is the film to see.",7,1,2,28 February 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," A cute film for the entire family. Don't miss it!
","MONSTERS, INC.  ***+  / Animated Comedy / Billy Crystal, John Goodman, James Coburn, Frank OzMonsters, Inc is a giant utility which generates power by scaring children. The story centers around the 'scarefloor,' an amazing bit of technology whereby just a few monsters can scare all the children of the world. This film is innovative not only in its animation, but in its plot twists. The writing is excellent. It's really a cute film for the entire family. Don't miss it! Be sure to stay for the 'out-takes.'",9,0,1,4 January 2002
Spider-Man," A light and airy approach to depicting a superhero. Fun!
","SPIDER-MAN  ***_  Action, Comedy, Romance / Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, Kirsten DunstA perfectly ordinary (even geeky) high school student discovers he has special powers after he is bitten by a genetically altered spider. He uses these abilities to fight evil.The first half of the film introduces and fleshes out the characters. I especially enjoyed the tongue-in-cheek style of humor as SPIDER-MAN teaches himself to use his new found abilities. He gets up to speed just in time to save New York City from a succession of two-bit hoods and one evil mastermind. What separates SPIDER-MAN from most action/special-effects movies is this one has a well thought out script! Special-effects are used to illustrate the story rather than the story being written to showcase the latest special-effects. And there's plenty of humor to go around. I really enjoyed this light and airy approach to depicting a superhero. This will likely be the beginning of a long series.",8,0,1,3 May 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Very enjoyable caper movie. Highly recommended!
","OCEAN'S ELEVEN  ***_  / Caper Comedy / Dir: Steven Soderbergh George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt DamonEleven guys undertake the biggest casino heist in Las Vegas history. A remake of the 1960s Rat Pack film, this version is even better. It is an improbable tale, combining elements of HOW TO STEAL A MILLION and MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. But director Steven Soderbergh pulls it off beautifully, mixing just the right amounts of comedy and adventure. While there is plenty of high-tech stuff, (and a few explosions) they do not take over the picture. It's highly enjoyable. I want to see ELEVEN again.",8,0,1,4 January 2002
Pearl Harbor," Technically excellent, but plot is slow and hard to swallow.
","**+   Romance, War DramaA love triangle set against the background of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the Dolittle bombing raid on Tokyo. The color of Hawaii is beautifully reproduced in sharp detail. Cinematography is great. Much of the film looks like 70mm. Sound is incredible. The best special effects I've ever seen. Technically, the film is simply flawless!However, the story is disjointed and somewhat hard to swallow. It frequently drags, and would have benefited from tighter editing. Yet I was disappointed so little time was devoted to historical events leading up to the attack.But this film is primarily a romance -- with obvious comparisons to TITANIC. The attack itself lasts 40 minutes or more, and matches the intensity of the first reel of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. It does a fantastic job of capturing the complete and utter confusion surrounding the surprise attack.There are Zillions of explosions, but relatively little gore for a war movie. In the end, I was somewhat disappointed. The audience I saw it with almost universally mirrored my feelings: 'I've seen it -- once.'",6,0,0,25 May 2001
School of Rock," This film is cute!
",I doubt the plotline will surprise anyone. Jack Black does an amazingly credible job as a substitute teacher with a mission. And the kids are a joy to watch. No car chases or explosions. This is a good film!,7,0,1,8 October 2003
Wimbledon," A fine date flick.
","Saw WIMBLEDON tonight. It's boy-meets-girl with a tennis background. Bit of a simple story, and there was never any question where it was going. But the film is quite well put together and I enjoyed it. First movie I've seen in months which could be appreciated by an adult. A good date flick. 8 out of 10. SawWIMBLEDON tonight.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A very well done, plot-driven film. Recommended.
","HARRY POTTER   ***_   Fantasy / Adventure Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, John Cleese, Richard HarrisHarry potter is 10 years old. He has lived with his aunt and uncle since he was 3 -- when his parents were killed by the 'Darth Vader' of the Sorcery world. Harry is disliked and generally mistreated by his step-parents and his spoiled step-brother. Harry has a natural ability for sorcery, and in one scene makes the glass disappear from the snake cage at the zoo. His brother, who had been beating on the glass to annoy the snake, falls in. No one is hurt. Soon Harry is afforded the opportunity to go to Hogwarts boarding school, where his magical abilities will be fine-tuned.The rest of the film chronicles Harry's adventures during his first year of school. HARRY POTTER is very well done. Contrary to the norm in today's big-budget special effects films, this movie is plot-driven. Special effects are used to bring the story to life, not to demonstrate what can be done today with computer animation. The characters are well-cast and believable. In spite of the subject matter being the occult, the overall tone of the film is highly moral. This is a film which can be enjoyed by the whole family.",8,0,1,16 November 2001
A Beautiful Mind," A heartwarming film. Recommended!
","A BEAUTIFUL MIND  ***_  Drama / Dir: Ron Howard / Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Ed HarrisIn the 1950s, a Mathematical genius develops an innovative newtheory of economics. The film follows John Nash's life through fourdecades -- from college, through bouts with schizophrenia,marriage, career problems, and finally to his winning the NobelPrize in Mathematics.BEAUTIFUL MIND is very well done. It chronicles the high pointsas well as the many low points in Mr Nash's life, without dwellingtoo heavily on the negative. No doubt some facts were glossedover to prevent the film becoming too depressing. The audiencegets a first-hand look at John's fantasy world as well as hisattempts to control it. The film is never boring, and surprisinglyupbeat.One car chase and one small nuclear explosion. Definitely worthseeing.",8,0,1,19 January 2002
Ice Age," A fine movie the whole family can enjoy!
","ICE AGE  **+_  Animated Adventure Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Jack BlackAt the onset of the Ice Age, a Mammoth, a Sabretooth Tiger, and a Sloth form an unlikely alliance in an attempt to return a lost human child to its tribe. If you were to compare ICE AGE to SHREK, the Mammoth takes the part of Shrek, while the Sloth takes the part of the won't-stop-talking Donkey. The squirrel you've seen in the trailers is actually a transitional character added mostly for comic relief between scenes. He adds a Road Runner style to the film. Filmed in three-dimensional computer animation (similar to SHREK) the film is visually quite good. While SHREK played well to audiences of all ages, ICE AGE is aimed more towards kids. But adults will love it too. I found the final scene (featuring the squirrel) worth the price of admission. No explosions, no car chases.",7,2,3,25 March 2002
Vanilla Sky," My candidate for Worst Film of the Year
","VANILLA SKY   (bomb)   / Drama   / Dir: Cameron Crowe / Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Cameron DiazA business executive is nearly killed when his jilted lover commits suicide by driving off a bridge. High points are the love scenes between Tom Cruise & Penelope Cruz as well as Tom Cruise & Cameron Diaz. Trouble is, for 1/3 of the film Tom Cruise wears a mask, and for another 1/3 his face is horribly disfigured. The directing and acting are quite adequate, but not inspired. While VANILLA SKY is long and plodding, its real problem is not in the execution, but with the script. The premise is so far-fetched it's worthless. VANILLA SKY is made up of flash forwards, flashbacks and dream sequences. It resembles LSD trip films of the '60s. The mix is so confusing it's not possible to tell the real from the dreams. But maybe that's the idea. I had no idea where this film was heading until it arrived. When it did, I found the experience totally unsatisfying.VANILLA SKY easily ranks as the worst film I've seen this year.Dave",1,1,4,15 December 2001
Amélie," A uniquely quirky and funny film with a sweet heart.

Hart's War," Definitely worth seeing.
","HART'S WAR  ***_ Bruce Willis, Colin Farrell, Terrence HowardIn a German prison camp during WWII, a law student is forced todefend a black prisoner in a Court Martial. HART'S WAR offers agritty and (I suspect) a pretty accurate view of life on a GermanPOW camp. What starts out as a remake of GREAT ESCAPE orHOGAN'S HEROES takes a sudden turn to new territory when amurder is committed inside the POW compound. There areenough plot twists to keep you guessing right until the closingcredits. No car chases. A few explosions. Very well done. Definitelyworth seeing.",7,0,1,21 February 2002
The Bourne Supremacy," Greatest overuse of 'Jiggle-Cam' since BLAIR WITCH PROJECT!
","Essentially a two-hour long, very high-energy chase with enoughplot twists to keep you from becoming bored. Many parts of thechase are quire creative. The film covers some beautiful Europeanlocations -- what you can see of them. Over 90% of the film is shot with an intentionally shaky handheldcamera, for the apparent purpose of adding reality and immediacyby giving it a home-movie or news camera look. If you are prone tomotion sickness, this film will make you toss your cookies. Bestbet: Sit as far back from the screen as possible. The audienceclose to the screen is going to be sick.Dave",5,0,1,24 July 2004
