Scarface," amazing atmosphere
","Whoever reads this;Scarface is about atmosphere. If you ever looked at movies by Brian de Palma or Martin Scorcese, you'll know that it's the general environmental and psychological atmosphere that's what it's about.Scarface has an unique, 80s type of 'surviving the streets' gangster mood to it, and that is what makes the movie so fine. Pacino's acting is really outstanding, because in the way he looks at things, you can tell the 'atmosphere' he is in.I recommend anybody who likes this movie's raw streetlike mood and attitude to listen to  Chef Raekwon's 'Only Built for Cuban Linx' album (on LOUD record label).",Null,0,1,8 May 2002
