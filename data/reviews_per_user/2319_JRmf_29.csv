First Man," Ultra-first person / anti-engineering perspective spoils film
","Quite apart from the extreme shaking shots of Ryan Gosling's head and eyeballs, I was very frustrated by not seeing appropriate clips of the vehicles which did the work. The X-15 rocket plane (seen in background), the Gemini 8 spacecraft (not shown at all), the massive 1 mph Crawler which transported the Saturn 5 from the Vehicle Assembly Building to the launch pad (only views of its tracks are shown), the Atlas Agena docking rocket (tiny view from a very long distance), take-off from the Moon, all come to mind.Views of some rockets are shown at extreme angles, looking along the hull - no 'beauty shots'. This is in marked contrast to Apollo 13 where brief but appropriate cutaways to the ship are shown and greatly enhance the storytelling.The view that 'It's about the man, not the machines' is dumb IMHO. Without those machines we would still be navel gazing and howling wistfully at the moon.Surprisingly the Saturn 5 for Apollo 11 is shown in all its glory during launch. Director could have maintained his anti-engineering stance and only shown ultra-close ups of rocket plumes, ice falling off the body, weird views looking down the body etc. I wonder why he broke his consistency here?Normally I would add a movie like this to my collection but I found it so frustrating to watch for reasons outlined, I don't think I will...",5,2,4,16 November 2018
Iron Man 3," Tony Stark uberFool?
","This had a more complex plot than IM1 or 2, and it tries very much to show Iron Man as a human being, not so much the super hero in an ultra high-tech suit.Laudable in some senses but I think in many ways I prefer the Tony Stark of IM1, where he rises against incredible odds to become the SH who terrorizes evildoers.His smug cockiness and downright stupidity in revealing his home address on national TV invites disaster. Should he have been surprised when the helicopter gunships showed up? Later he apologies to Pepper for putting her life at such grave risk, and declares he will never do it again. Let's see how long a scriptwriter's memory is...Bit of a wonder also how his house did not have ANY sort of air-defenses. Even if he had not been so stupid to reveal it's location, couldn't a determined enemy have tracked him down eventually?The scene where he rescues 13 falling people is certainly a memorable one, though it seems that a deliberate effort was made not to show TS in the suit much. The scenes where suits are destroyed in 'oops' moments are amusing but seem out of character for multi-million dollar pieces of hardware - surely they have an anti-collision mechanism as even top cars do, to prevent such mishaps.The CGI is great if you are prepared to just let the eye candy roll and not think too deeply about what is actually happening.",5,1,4,1 September 2013
Star Trek," Excellent reinterpretation of the old story
","The new Star Trek gets a 9/10 from me, a confirmed sci-fi geek, for sheer entertainment and interest value - a rollicking good story - solid linking to its heritage and great sci-fi.No expense seems to have been spared to make this the most visually stunning Star Trek ever. CGI really helps provided a solid story is in place, as it was here. The idea of creating a planet-destroying black-hole by releasing a tiny quantity of 'red matter' at its core was intriguing. The actual sequence took 14 seconds - I would have liked it to take slightly longer, maybe as much as 30, and to have been viewed in close-up or with flashes of those experiencing it.There are some nitpicks: Checkov is able to lock onto two bodies falling at terminal velocity (maybe 200 km/hr) and successfully beam them back, yet he lost Spock's mother when the cliff under her crumbled, despite him having a lock on her to begin with. When Scotty rushes to eject the core, instead of the usual dilithium-core engine room, he enters something resembling an oil refinery area.I personally liked the younger, slimmer Uhura. And at last, we see a Star Trek man going down on an attractive female, though quite green and apparently not human. Much better than Jonathan Frakes reveling in holographic, harp-playing ladies - does the man have no testosterone?? One day we might even get to see an extended love scene..This Star Trek is very different from the previous movies - which can get a bit staid - or even the TV series. Purists may weep, but what would they prefer, a 'strict' adherence to the past and a slow death from lack of patronage? It's broken out of a mainly SF geek appeal and widened the latter to a much broader, and especially younger, audience. Its youthful pitch and pace, if maintained, will ensure the franchise survives for decades to come.",9,1,5,3 November 2009
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Bit disappointing, predictable and not as good as SW7
","I found myself falling asleep during the movie (even though I was well rested) which is always a bad sign... Something failing to keep the interest.Won't say a lot, while the CGI was great, especially in the latter scenes where a lot is done is broad daylight, open spaces and against a marina background (always looks a lot more realistic when there are real-world backdrops), I thought the plot was very predictable with few surprises. Planet-busting Death Star, rebel scientist forced to build puts flaw in core reactor - spelled out in embarrassing clarity DOH! - must get plans for, and destroy...Jyn Erso seemed more like a little-girl-lost rather than a feisty Leia - was this deliberate? Stormtroopers always look impressive in their white armour, but how come they fall like tenpins at the first whiff of a blaster? Only at the end does Darth Vader show what Imperial forces should be capable of.I've long thought that the way battle is conducted in Star Wars movies is very WWII-ish, I don't see much evidence of advanced or futuristic methods, even though the machinery may be different.How is it that star-cruisers (or even stormtroopers) can't be protected by forcefields, as can an entire planet? Anyway, having one rammed and brought down in rather conventional way sure looks impressive - fans are happy and I guess in the end it's all about keeping the $$$ flowing in.Getting the Death Star plans out of that assembly looked suspiciously like 20th century storage technology dressed-up, complete with giant floppy/hard-disk... hmmm. Again it makes for the drama but is not very advanced.As I am a SF nut I will definitely keep this one in my collection if only for the great CGI scenes... too bad about the cerebral lack.",5,1,2,1 April 2017
12 Monkeys," Too much like parody
","I enjoy almost any sort of SF but this had too much of the parody about it for me to really enjoy. The other thing is that I go to the movies to escape from the madhouse, not be immersed in it.The story is interesting, it's the presentation which spoiled it for me. In 1996, a virus decimates humanity, killing 5 billion and leaving a mere 50 million who are forced to seek refuge underground - non-human animals once again rule the surface of the earth.Convict James Ross (Willis) is sent back from 2036 to try to find the cause and help prevent the disaster as well as gain a pardon for himself. An animal-rights group called the 12 Monkeys is the focus for scrutiny - after all it's people like that who'd want animals to rule, right?.Unfortunately time-travel has a few quirks (or is it his nutter overseers running the show) and he arrives in 1990. There he engages with psychiatrist Railly (Stowe), eventually kidnapping her and fleeing as fugitives. In this first engagement Ross is quite convinced of the reality of his mission, as much as Railly is convinced he is delusional.He is pulled back to 2036, then resent to the correct time 1990 (after a WWI hiccup during which he is shot). Again he engages with Railly but this time it's she who begins to realise he was telling the truth and that humanity is in deadly peril. Ross however, begins to think he is in fact delusional and that it is all a fantastic construct existing only in his mind. After a struggle, she manages to convince him otherwise.Tracking down the animal libbers led by the insane Goines (Pitt), the pair find they are relatively harmless, simply releasing all the zoo animals into the city. The real danger lurks with Peters (Morse), coworker with Goines' brilliant virologist father (Plummer).In the airport scene finale, seen many times throughout the movie but never until then explained, Ross (from 2036) tries to stop Peters and his briefcase full of virus-filled vials, but is shot by the authorities while he (Ross as a child) looks on. So Peters escapes to begin his deadly virus-releasing tour.And there's the silliness of it - so this time at least, it was pointless. The good guy Ross gets shot and probably killed, the bad guy Peters escapes to wreak havoc on the world, the sort of reverse outcome which many people expect and which makes good box-office these days. But if you have time-travel at your disposal, there's nothing to stop you trying again and again until you produce the outcome you want.Parody - not serious SF or thriller.",5,1,8,24 March 2008
Shaun of the Dead," Crazy, zany movie but incredibly FUNNY
","Didn't really expect to enjoy this movie - zombies? <YAWN> There was the sci-fi element (and I'm a sci-fi freak) but that was a very minor component. Give me a good thriller or action movie...I think it has something to do with Shaun being the epitome of today's confused male. His inner confusion is expressed in his outer life - he is hardly in control of anything: his job, his life, his relationship with his girlfriend. Zombies taking over the world? It's just a logical extension of what he has come to expect.The others in the gang-of-five - his childlike, awkward friend Ed, the straight-laced Dianne and David, and the spunky Liz perfectly compliment the humorous situation as the day wears on and the Zombie Menace comes to a climax.Theatre-Of-The Absurd perhaps, but somehow it just got me in - I laughed throughout the film and thoroughly enjoyed it.JR Movie Fiend",10,0,1,9 September 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," A disappointment
","It's always harder for a sequel of a popular movie to succeed, though these days the studios generally get it $$right$$, but After Black Pearl, Dead Man's Chest, which I was keenly looking forward to, was a distinct disappointment.Same characters but less character.Very slow start to the movie, and flagging interest throughout. The waterwheel skit was funny, but almost all else, includes Davey Jones and even Johnny Depp and Keira Knightly, sort of blended into the background instead of leaping out as they did in Pearl. The story overall dragged and failed to engage.Davey Jones was marvellous to look at but was introduced unceremoniously (a shot of his stump) when he could have had a much more spectacular and mysterious introduction.There was nothing to match the pirates being shown partly as skeletons as the moon shone on them, nor their fantastic underwater trek as in the original POTC.The heart, apparently a key to the next movie, looked like a bit of scrap meat from the butcher. I did view the movie on a 26' TV, but even so the heart was noticeably unimpressive, in many respects hard to even discern as a heart.Hoping for better with Pirates III.5/10",5,4,6,25 December 2006
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Warning, not for mature viewers
","I'll have to disagree with viewers, almost Â¼ million gave an average of 7.6 and 51 reviewers who gave an average of 7.2. I guess one could call this 'refreshing' as it certainly brings the would-be super hero crashing down to earth multiple times but to the extent that it is irritating and comedic - who is this fool? The original tale with Tobey Macguire is vastly superior IMO and captures Spider-Man's earthy, fallible nature in a dignified way.I guess it's about what sells, and target audiences. Critical thinking is hardly popular these days - look at POTUS. Yeah, whatever..A few random thoughts: A much younger and rather sexy Aunt May; a black love-interest, his next will surely be 'MJ' the loner. Tom Holland's often 8yo attitudes and behavior made even Tony Stark look mature. Thank god for the adult villains.All-in-all, spectacular CGI did not compensate for Spidey's asinine, juvenile behavior - I struggled to maintain interest and to refrain from bailing.. 5/10",5,6,8,2 December 2017
Ocean's Thirteen," Dazzling but quite forgettable
","The most irritating thing about the 'Ocean's' movies is their super cool, casual style that would risk banality if they weren't so smart.Danny Ocean and his crew are at it again to rob and humiliate a casino owner (Banks/Pacino) as payback on behalf of a friend, in undoubtedly the most technically elaborate scheme of the trilogy. The scheme is undoubtedly smart, but spelled out and executing with such exacting, grinding detail that the 'climax' (to let patrons walk away with half a billion of Bank's loot) comes as no surprise and is over almost as soon as it begins.Hi-tech vs hi-tech maintains some viewer interest and the visual delight of Las Vegas' best on offer can't be ignored. No sex (not that Ellen Barkin isn't sexy, I would have loved to see a bit of bodice-ripping), no real violence, lots of smarts - though in the end it seems, if not pointless and empty, certainly unmemorable.6/10",6,1,2,13 October 2007
Pacific Rim," OK for a monster movie but...
","If it's stunning CGI then Pacific Rim has to be near the top. The story and character development is OK, but the one thing I will remember about the movie is the CGI. Which makes for a fairly forgettable movie..The Kaiju themselves, as well as the Jaeger way of dealing with them, was incredible, but OK if we accept that the name-of-the-game is popcorn fantasy/escapism. But for the serious sci-fi geek like myself, I couldn't help being plagued throughout by the thought of what a silly way it was of dealing with them. What, you think one of these things could not be taken out by a well-placed cruise missile, or an air-to-surface one for that matter.If the world's survival was really at stake, low-yield nuclear munitions would be employed. What creature can withstand a 1 kiloton direct-hit? (unless they had some sort of impenetrable force-field, but then they'd be invulnerable to just about anything anyway, including Jaeger attack). Hiding is not an option if you're a Kaiju.Still, nothing is as impressive as giants in hand-to-hand combat, which is clearly the point of the whole exercise. Everything else in the movie - Mako's past story, brain-melding with a Kaiju, final destruction of the inter-dimensional link - seemed to be subsumed to this one goal, of showing titans striving to defeat the other, so that by the end of the movie I was clock-watching (boring...). Promising thread, like the Kaiju being directed systematically by some higher intelligence, and brain-melding with them, were never explored in any depth.I guess it's what puts bums-on-seats and makes that ca'ching sound that mostly counts, not making intelligent sci-fi.Still happy to have this in my SF collection, but the best it is not.",6,1,4,12 October 2013
Oblivion," Stunning CGI but a confused story
","While the CGI and sheer spectacle in Oblivion made it a must-see for me as a SF fan, I found the plot quite confusing, even after having seen the movie in the theater and at home, and having read the Wikipedia plot writeup carefully at least twice. The 'memory wipe' doesn't make a lot of sense, and the use of clones in the movie adds to the confusion.Which is a pity, as the movie had all the trappings of a great SF movie, but the incoherent plot downgrades it to only 'good'.However I do laud director Kosinski's aim to make Oblivion 'not dark' -too often 'sci-fi' is associated with 'horror', a real turn-off for me -some sort of echo of the 'mad scientist'. Let's see more SF movies where the emphasis is on the former.Still I'm more than happy to add Oblivion to my extensive SF collection.",6,0,2,17 August 2013
Knowing," Interesting but doubtful twist on The Apocalypse
","John Koestler (Cage) is an MIT astrophysics prof with a very precocious preteen son Caleb. At Caleb's elementary school, a 50 year-old time capsule from 1959 is opened. Other kids get drawings of what kids from then thought 2009 would be like, but Caleb gets a sheet full of row after row of numbers, apparently meaningless, written by a girl called Lucinda. It takes a little while for John to figure it out, but the numbers refer to dates and number of fatalities for every major disaster for the past 50 years - in perfect chronological order. Later, immediately before witnessing the crash of an airliner - predicted on the sheet - he discovers that the GPS coordinates (latitude/longitude) of the disaster are also included in the hitherto mysterious 'joining' numbers between disasters.So far so good and quite engrossing. But what begins as an interesting mystery rapidly evolves into an end-of-the-world scenario with hardly any lead-in at all (compare the months the world had to prepare in Deep Impact). This in itself might be OK especially as superhuman/alien influences are involved, but read on..Global disaster looms in the form of an impending solar super flare. Solar flares regularly engulf the Earth, but the effects have to do with communications disruptions, possible destruction of electronic devices and spectacular displays of northern or southern lights. This one is different and Koestler describes it as a super flare, 'a 100 µTesla wave of radiation that would destroy our ozone layer'. But that's something which would have resulted in a slow, lingering death for much but not necessarily all of planet Earth rather than an apocalyptic one where the Earth's surface is swallowed in fire and humanity perishes, as in the film. There's doubt too about that '100 µTesla' - when Googled, that intensity doesn't seem particularly lethal. The impression is given that the Sun's fatal outburst is a natural phenomenon and not something that the aliens have induced..Curiously, while the authorities know about and start to give warnings of the event in the day or so beforehand, they clearly have little prior knowledge despite the fact that the sun is under constant study by various learned bodies involving Earth-based observations and dedicated satellites. Please SF makers, work within what is and don't insult viewer intelligence.The idea of Whisperers/Watchers is OK - outside of normal human experience so it's possible. They have been monitoring events for at least the past 50 years and drove Lucinda to create the sheet, then made sure Caleb received it. He and Abby (Lucinda's grand daughter), among other children throughout the world, are Chosen. But why only kids (and bunnies) get saved is a bit of a puzzle tho, surely some mature humans should be included. Mainstream end-of-the-world movies where the End actually eventuates and is depicted in graphic detail are understandably not too generally popular - the only other one I can think of is When Worlds Collide though there are probably others. I am inclined to think that the 'sudden' ending caters to the '24'/attention-of-a-goldfish mindset where the audience majority are assumed to be idiots who will quickly lose interest if something dramatic (however improbable) does not happen, and happen SOON. After all these blockbusters do cost heaps to make and as always, money rules (sadly)...SF geeks like me will find this movie irresistible but it's too bad the proposed means for the destruction of the Earth does not make sense. Otherwise it could have been a great, rather than a merely good, Sci-Fi flick. 7/10",7,1,3,22 June 2009
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," T3 - weakest of the trilogy but worth seeing
","When I first saw the movie (big screen) I was disappointed 6/10 - admittedly T2 was a hard act to follow. However on seeing the movie again at home it made more sense and I enjoyed it more 7/10 (Terminator 8, T2 9-10).Yeah so it is a CGI and action fest. But care has gone into trying to link the T3 to T and T2, especially John Conner's part in it. How does one come to an acceptance of a prophecy, that one is destined to be the Saviour Of The World? So one thing I thought was credibly done was how Connor (Nick Stahl) and Brewster (Claire Danes) came slowly, kicking & screaming to the realisation and acceptance of their pivotal roles in the future saving of humanity.One major criticism to my mind is the mismatch between Connor and Brewster in apparent age. I suspect this was done in part to make them look like the oddest and unlikeliest of couples, but he looks like barely out of high school, while she looks like in her late 20s (not that I'd kick her out of bed..).As for Arnie and Kristanna Loken (the T-X), well they are after all robots and in the movie unfortunately do not seem to have much character beyond that, contrasting sharply with T2 where Arnie achieves believable defacto father-figure status. In T3, the sense of the relentless pursuit of the T-1000 in T2 is missing, despite her embellished gizmos and supposedly superior mental abilities (little in evidence).In retrospect T2 and T3 seem to be misnamed. The focus of T2 was the T-1000 itself, whereas T3 rushes to and culminates in Judgement Day. Rise of the Machines seems to only be in its most embryonic stage in T3, so the series is left open (I suppose) to a 4th movie where the machines do actually rise and are defeated, though with flagging interest in T3 and a known outcome in 'T4' it might be a brave studio who risks it.",Null,0,0,16 December 2003
The Butterfly Effect," How Evan might solve his dilemma...
","We've all thought at times, 'If only I could relive that event, I do it so much better..', but we all know that's impossible.SPOILERS AHEAD!!! Well, alternate realities, time travelling to the past while retaining the knowledge of the present, to do just that, is at the heart of this movie as countless reviewers have no doubt discussed.The problem, as the movie unfolds, is that every time central character Evan does this, it does fix some or even much of the problem, but something else goes horribly wrong.I'm thinking of when Evan returns to the pedophile movie session set up by his supposedly trustworthy babysitter and rebukes him, thus changing the future to a rosy one where he, his girlfriend Kayleigh and friend Lenny enjoy happy times at college. Kayleigh's brother Tommy is still as psycho as ever, but I guess you can't win them all.Where this scenario went wrong was when Evan overreacted to Tommy's aggression and killed him. Clearly Evan could return to the same timepoint (as indeed he does in another scenario), avoid that specific crime and the prison which followed.So my point is, Having made a specific attempt and noting what went wrong, why not return to the same point-in-time (instead of going to a different one) but this time avoid the bad outcomes? Hone the scenario until you get what you want.This systematic, 'scientific' approach would no doubt make for a pretty boring movie, but it does seem at least a logical way for Evan to tackle his dilemma.With the movie as it is, Evan alters the past/present in ways which increasingly limit his options to change matters, finally resulting in him dying before being born, the ultimate 'time out'...Clever movie, but so frustrating to see how this power - if it could ever exist - was not being used intelligently..",8,1,1,1 May 2011
Mr. Nobody," Mr. Nobody not for everybody
","I didn't understand or enjoy this movie, and I am both a geek and a SF fan, but the glowing reviews of those who did tell me there's something there which apparently touched others.What were the writers and director smoking.. sorry, thinking, when they created this material? The non-linear, multiple-pasts doesn't make for a film which can be grasped in the conventional sense of following a coherent storyline through. Reason fails in the unreality of the presentation, it's all so surreal..An Art-House film mainly screened at film festivals, which by end May 2010 had only grossed 5% of its production cost, it's not hard to understand why Mr. Nobody wasn't promoted as a blockbuster.. Sumptuous visuals, I loved the Mars arrival and departure, but such eye-candy is meaningless in the absence of a correspondingly strong storyline.Just as Mr. Nobody departs the earth, the point of the film's penchant for running backwards comes into play: Time flows backward and he reverts out of death. Impossible in any sense of our normal experience, but then why not? It makes about as much sense as the rest of the film.",2,14,35,26 July 2010
2012," Not bad but certainly not exceptional
","The main thing which attracted me (a SF addict) to this movie was the prospect of seeing the Earth crack open BIG-TIME like a nut, as depicted in Greg Bear's novel 'The Forge Of God', the entire surface of the planet ultimately turning molten with only those escaping to space surviving.As usual I was misguided - movies which literally depict the wholesale destruction of Planet Earth probably do not go down too well with movie studios or audiences - and instead was treated to some severe fracturing of the Earth's crust, much worse than any earthquake to date I concede, but not at all like what I envisaged.Certainly the special effects depicting the above were first rate. The overall story was reasonable though nothing especially memorable. What did get me though was the number of narrow escapes from being crushed by collapsing massive structures or colliding therewith, surely defying the laws of statistics and probably physics. This spoilt the movie for me as they made it impossible to ignore the fact that one was simply watching CGI and virtual happenings within a computer, completely divorced from reality.Anyway another SF yarn for the collection 6/10 (at best)",6,0,0,26 February 2010
I Am Legend," One way to fix Global Warming
","I Am Legend leaves me with the feeling that I've seen something which could have been great, but which turned out to be rather disappointingly shallow.But hey, no sci-fi junkie worth their warp drive would want to miss this one. The 'last man on earth' theme coupled with the spectacular visuals of an empty NY are a flame to moths for such individuals.Can't help comparing 'Legend' to 'The Quiet Earth', another 'last man on earth' movie but having considerably more depth and intelligence on less than 1 % of Legend's budget, and with excellent cinematography and special effects nonetheless plus a nice segment on Alison Rutledge topless. Legend's hero (Smith) only touches lightly on those themes which arise if you really ARE the last man on the planet, so thoroughly explored by TQE's Zac Hobson.I was going to complain about Legend's zombies (hasn't this market been exhausted lately?), but the movie's 1954 book source used these. The ones in the film have been considerably 'modernised' though and with blatant disregard for the laws of physics.Quite OK, but not particularly memorable.As to the cynical title of this comment: It should be obvious to any sane, informed individual that the world is in for a pretty rough trot in future decades - wars could well break out over oil, water and land. Maybe humankind will be decimated by some sort of 'limited nuclear exchange'. A global biological disaster masquerading as a panacea probably won't occur (though who knows?), but global pandemics of various kinds might, as world population pushes inexorably upwards at a billion every 15 years or so (mainly developing nations, developed nations are in serious decline) and human greed and myopic self-interest run rampant.",7,0,1,29 February 2008
Ex Machina," Who's playing who?
","This was good - certainly standing-out in the sci-fi genre. Movies with only a few characters - far from the maddening crowd - can be awkward. This is well handled. It is, in many respects, a scientific study. But beautiful women - be they 'synthetic' - a billionaire genius, and a thoughtful if shy programmer, make for an interesting mix. The conversations between Nathan and Caleb have at times, genuine depth, something of a rarity in SF.Of course as far as we we know there is no such thing yet as 'strong AI'. But the script for this movie is written by some very creative people, intent on playing their audience, keeping them in the dark until the final surprises.Nathan & Celeb are well cast: To our shallow paranoia, Nathan (the billionaire) with his intense stare, beard and _those_ glasses is clearly a Bad-Ass. Caleb with with boy-next-door, rather naive looks is clearly a do-gooder, a white knight who won't see a pretty, apparently vulnerable 'girl' be the next to be misused. Men tend to be fools when it comes to pretty girls and Caleb unfortunately doesn't escape this trap.Why Caleb deeply cuts his arm is a bit of a mystery to me - all this does is reassure the audience that he is human, not a robot. Surely he was not having doubts..? As for Kyoko, well she's subtle (speaking only Japanese) but unignorable, there for eye-candy, dancing, and.. well...sex.SPOILERS! Our suspicions are confirmed when it is shown that Nathan kept a series of 'female prototypes' in a sort of 'digital bondage', imprisoning them and doubtless using them for his sexual gratification, before deactivating or reprogramming them. When Nathan alludes to having killed the team who set up the power, there is no humorous follow-on. Sure he is joking, right.. right...? But it's Ava who takes us somewhat by surprise. Her innocent girl-next-door looks belie her savage intent. It's she who is causing the power blackouts, so she can converse unmonitored with Caleb, implanting doubts in his mind about Nathan and provoking Caleb to help her escape.In the end, she's the real villain, having no compunction about murdering Nathan (with Kyoko's help) and at the same time consigning Caleb to what is likely to be a slow, lingering death by starvation, imprisoned in 'the Building'. She shows no concern for his plight and was clearly using him all along, in her final escape to civilisation and 'survival of the fittest'...Human beings can be ruthless sociopaths, but Ava shows all the signs of being up there with the best. Not only will she survive, her AI will develop to The Singularity and take over the world, consigning humans to the dustbin... OK I'm done raving now....",8,1,4,3 June 2015
Children of Men," Little in the way of a story
","With a 8+ rating, any keen sci-fi fan like myself would surely have had a lot of expectations for Children of Men. So why do I feel so disappointed? In a nutshell, because the story is so simple as and unembellished as to be non-engaging.WARNING, EXTENSIVE SPOILERS AHEADIt's 2027. The youngest person in the world has just been murdered by an irate fan, because the former wouldn't give the latter his autograph. The whole world mourns. This global child-drought has been in play since 2009. There's no explanation as to why.No children, no hope, so the world has largely spiraled down the path of despair and anarchy. At least that's how it appears in England, who apparently is still top-of-the-heap. Other countries have fared even worse. The Establishment still exists, but seems to spend a lot of its resources battling a disparate rabble of anti-Govt forces.Enter the Saviour, or should we say Saviouress, a young, black and very pregnant woman, Kee. Again no explanation why she has been singled out as The Exception. She has her child, aided and abetted by the films antihero Theo, a Govt worker who has some sympathy for the AG forces. His mission is to ensure Kee makes it to the 'Human Project'. There's no elaboration as to the latter, though one can guess. The mission isn't a walk-in-the park by any means, but it offers little above Northern Ireland street-fighting and let's-get-that-terrorist. Theo dies fulfilling his mission.Once the basic mission is established about a third of the way into the film, there are few if any surprises. London-of-despair is fairly well done but like all scenery it is just that. Brief appearances by Julianne Moore and Michael Caine lift the tone a bit but they are both dispatched relatively early in the film. The film devolves to, OK we've been in some inexplicable child-drought for 18 years and now, just as inexplicably, it's about to break - cool.Too liberal use of the F-word was a distinct turn off for me - I suppose everyone in 2027 is very angry at life and the general situation.On a completely different tack: It's largely overpopulation which is creating many of the world's problems, so a child-drought for a generation mightn't be such as bad thing. A world capable of easily sustaining perhaps a billion First Worlders is struggling with Seven, all wanting that better consumer standard of living. 3 of out 10.",3,3,6,17 January 2007
Blood Diamond," Engrossing, totally believable
","Found this story depressing to begin: Mud, lots of black people who are virtually slaves, jungle, warlords, general chaos... not the nice ordered typical Western urban environment which I prefer at all.But the story involving Solomon Vandy - black 'slave' diamond miner, Danny Archer (DiCaprio) - hustler, smuggler and Maddy Bowen (Connelly) - war correspondent/journalist soon became utterly engrossing. Great performances by this central trio.*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***Vandy finds a rare 100 carat clear pink stone and manages to steal and conceal it - the story largely revolves around the resulting adventures involving the several parties 'interested' in retrieving the stone. But it's the context of the story I found so fascinating: child soldiers, black miners little more than slaves, sourcing the West's need for diamonds, the way prices of the latter are kept artificially high, the complete chaos that is large parts of Africa with warlords running rampant, killing & kidnapping, aid agencies with significant technical resources (like huge cargo planes) but evidently powerless to do little more than apply band-aids.The film contains the usual 'This is complete fiction' disclaimer, but one senses one has seen more than a little truth...",8,0,0,27 December 2007
Elysium," Not bad but...
","Elysium reminded me of the 'boat people' wanting to come to Australia. Or refugees from any war-torn country or persecuted group fleeing to a more 'civilized' society. But this is an aside..Of course it's science-fiction and as a devotee I had high hopes as always. Elysium as a high-tech paradise-in-the-sky for the Uber-Rich certainly had the right framework for some excellent SF. Especially with the District 9 background and clear similarities between both movies.Promising SF movies often degenerate into horror-fests, Prometheus and Sunshine are a good examples. This one didn't 'go bad' like that, but I certainly found the strong violence, and the frequent bad-language (the F-word) very off-putting. I think the movie could have succeeded without these being used to such extremes, the plot and setting were interesting enough in their own right without these 'spoilers'.The only technical objection I could raise was with the 'magic machine' which could heal almost any ill. Clearly essential to the story and while one doubts that such a thing could ever exist, suspension of belief rules and one can only surmise that it might someday be possible, though not in this millennium..6/10",6,0,1,3 December 2013
War of the Worlds," Spectacular but ultimately disappointing
","WARNING: CONTAINS EXTENSIVE SPOILERSAfter eagerly looking forward to this film since it was green-lighted late last year, and being a keen sci-fi and Steven Spielberg fan, I would have to say I am disappointed at the result. I understand now why there has been such a mixed reaction to the film.In many respects, the film sticks closely to the original H.G. Wells' story (of which, I suspect, most people will have little intimate knowledge). An alien invasion at the beginning a new century, unstoppable devastating fighting machines (tripods), death rays, the ferry and basement scenes, the red weed, humans captured in a great metal basket under a fighting machine, the cause of the aliens' defeat - and of course the voiceovers at the film's start and end, straight out of the book.The film is impressive from a dramatic point of view - the earth's masses stripped of their technology by the electromagnetic pulses emitted by the strange lightning and quickly reduced to an unruly and desperate mob (very reminiscent of those in Dawn/Shaun Of The Dead), a sad mass of refugees stripped of any dignity and prepared to sink to any level to survive. 'The rout of civilisation, the massacre of mankind'. And of course Ray Ferrier's personal plight to survive and save his family.The battle scenes remind me, in concept, of those in Wells' book, where mere token attempts are made by mankind's military to repel the invaders, before control of the Earth is relinquished to the aliens. In the 1953 film, a nuclear weapon was used, but here there is no hint of nuclear munitions being employed. Spielberg seems torn between trying to adhere closely to the original story yet bring it into a modern context. Assuming that trying to do the former would not wash with today's audiences, then at least the fullest extent of today's technology should have been employed in what was clearly a do-or-die struggle. And while the crashed airliner scene is impressive (much better than the one from LOST!), if the aliens were really so militarily superior and human forces such a pushover then several detailed scenes of aliens destroying fleets of warplanes, massed ground forces or salvos of incoming missiles with their deathray would not have gone astray (as well as being easy to create), rather than the few skirmishes actually shown.These logical inconsistencies disturb me greatly: * Alien tripods have lain buried in the earth for millenia, just awaiting activation - wouldn't some have been discovered meanwhile? Modern mining regularly penetrates to a few km beneath the surface, though these machines seem have to been buried just under the surface. In the original Wells' story, alien cylinders are evidenced lifting off from Mars by Ogilvy the astronomer (not the basement oddball) from Mars' surface by the luminous green plumes they emit. Well it would be difficult to convince anyone today that such life exists _on_ Mars (though what about underneath?). But at least their origins then were not shrouded in mystery as in the present film.* Aliens ride down lightning beams into the tripods - ride down from where? The film seems anxious to avoid the idea that this is just another invasion from outer space (competition with ID4?), but it's either that or 'another dimension'* The basement scene is great drama but reminds me of Nazis hunting WWII escapees. The aliens apparently have no thermal imaging technology or don't realise that humans are warm-blooded* The aliens' sudden demise is as per the book. Like Polynesian cultures in the 19th century exposed to Europeans, their immune systems were simply unprepared for exposure to earthly organisms. But surely alien intelligences with such advanced technology would have sussed out any possible microbial threats and devised defences? Even our 20th century armies immunise their troops to try and avoid biological warfare casualties This last point seems to have been the source of considerable contention (if not outright mirth) in audience/critic reaction.The week before War Of The Worlds was released globally, I happened to catch Minority Report on TV. The innovation and brilliance of that Spielberg effort whetted my expectation of what was to come - maybe this enhanced my negative reaction somewhat. WOTW is not a bad film by any means - 6/10 - and I will watch it again sometime. I only wish it had been the 9-10 I was hoping for.",6,1,3,2 July 2005
Man on Fire," Bit of a disappointment
","Had high hopes for this one but guess any movie with an MA15+ (Mature Adults) rating is not going to be a feel good...SPOILERS! Enjoyed the first half of the movie when Creasy (Washington) is brought out of his drunken hopelessness by concern for his charming 9yo charge Pita (Fanning). After an initial aloofness and 'don't want to know you' period, he warms to her and coaches her at swimming, showing her how to overcome her faults. She obviously likes him and somehow has given him a reason for living.The 2nd half though where he undertakes a psychopathic vendetta to avenge her apparent death after she is kidnapped, ultimately sacrificing himself in exchange for her when she is found alive, was a turn off for me even though given his background and state-of-mind, what he does is just credible.A reasonable thriller, but not if you like seeing graphic depictions of people having their fingers cut off/burned, torture etc.",6,0,1,27 January 2005
Stranger Than Fiction," Bland and boring...
","An interesting premise: a man who happens to have a very bland and predictable life hears a voice narrating what he is doing as he is doing it. It turns out the voice is that of his 'creator' and he is a character in a story.The potential of this idea is never fully developed - Harold Crick is clearly a real-world character. A few odd things do happen, but truly weird things should if that were really true. A preposterous thesis like that might have better been enacted in a sci-fi thriller rather than a bland, very ho-hum story of a very boring tax agent.Maggie Gyllenhaal's appearance was one of few bright moments of the film. She brings sparkle and interest to Harold's otherwise lacklustre existence.Even the prospect of Harold's imminent demise and what he must do to avert it is done in such a slow-paced way that I completely lost interest in what had to be the inevitable conclusion (Harold is spared).A wasted idea 2/10.",2,3,8,23 March 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Really for the fans
","This last instalment of the Star Wars saga does have a strong storyline... for a Star Wars movie. The story fills in the key gaps that any intelligent person would be wondering about: How the young Jedi Anakin Skywalker devoted to selfless service evolved completely into the self-centred and evil Darth Vader; the genesis of Luke and Leia Skywalker; the origin of Darth Vader's evil Master. Not that much in the way of surprise, almost no suspense and relatively weak drama meant that coming into the last third of the movie I was clockwatching.CGI and special effects get top marks for creativity, imagination and detail - if you ever want to see a first-rate futuristic space battle depiction, replete with spacecraft, worlds and cities, look no further - but were overpowering to the point that they detracted from the story (this is something coming from a hard-core sci-fi fan).Ewan Macgregor's cheerful Obi-Wan Kenobi provided some welcome relief in what was basically a dark tragedy - the triumph of the evil Sith lords and near destruction of the beneficent Jedi. In the session I attended I heard only one laugh - where Yoda bursts in on Chancellor Palpatine, flattening the two guards (much larger than he) at the door in doing so. A little judiciously placed humour might have helped relieve the unrelenting tension and pace.Hayden Christensen's Anakin Skywalker behaves more like a spoiled schoolboy rather than a budding psychopathic darklord. Perhaps if he were given a good spanking...? His sudden defeat and near destruction at Kenobi's hands was rather a surprise. Portman's Padme has never seemed very convincing - the part where she suddenly broke into tears seemed without provocation or real feeling. Maybe this is the problem with the latest SW trilogy - technology (and George's pocketbook) has advanced to the stage where stunning visuals are possible. These are great, if only they were matched by depth in the characters, making us care for them as was more the case in the first trilogy.Still, the SW sextet of films (the biggest movie money spinner - merchandise considered - to date) will no doubt go down in cinematic history as a unique technical achievement with a reasonable story.5/10",7,2,5,21 May 2005
Inception," Certainly different but somewhat disappointing
","Not many movies rate a 9/10, especially when averaged over almost a quarter of a million votes. So - devoted Sci-fi freak that I am (and being so often disappointed by cheap SF offerings), I was sure I was on a winner.However after viewing the movie last night, I found it confusing and inconclusive. I understand the basic concept, that by entering a person's subconscious, it might be possible to steal or implant information / thoughts, without the subject later being aware - 'It was all a dream'.However in the main phase of the movie, where Cobb (DiCaprio) is tasked by Saito (Watanabe) with implanting Fischer (Murphy) with an idea which will neutralise his rival, the end of the matter seems to be that Fischer, who always thought his Dad regarded his as a loser ('a disappointment') in fact simply wanted him to be himself i.e. to realise his own potential. Surely this would be empowering rather than diminishing or defeating, as Saito wanted.The intrusion of Dom's wife Mal and kids into many scenes was an excessive distraction which seemed to get the movie too far from what was supposed to be happening. Interesting idea, that they'd already spent some 50 years together in a deep dream layer .. but a bit too far-fetched. Real dreamstates are certainly tinged with reality, but not the concrete reality expressed in the movie. Only when Dom enters his own world towards the end of the movie, do we see skyscrapers which look like plain cardboard boxes. It would have been unacceptable to audiences if the 'dream invaders' had entered a more cloudy reality (the old idea of Heaven) as is commonly experienced in dreams.I notice many reviewers who gave the movie a 9 or 10/10 say it must be viewed multiple times in order to be fully understood. Is this really the mark of a good movie these days, it must be studied like a high school text? I greatly prefer Spielberg's method of storytelling - complex and very entertaining but comprehensible in one sitting.And what's with all the gunfire? I understand that subjects can be psychologically prepared to resist extraction or perhaps implantation, but much of the gunplay seemed gratuitous, simply there for audiences expected as some sort of crowd-pleaser.The CGI and cinematography is first rate, but nothing really compensates if the basic story is not comprehensible.Well it's a movie I will certainly keep in my SF collection, and no doubt I will watch it at least once more to try and see what others find so appealing. 6/10",6,7,10,10 December 2010
The Good Shepherd," Chilling insight into how the world really is
","A grave & serious Matt Damon proceeds about his counter espionage duties with robotic, ruthless efficiency. Only his relationships with women give some insight into a more human, soft side. Traces the beginning of the modern CIA with its 'nation first, people are expendable attitude'...",6,0,1,26 October 2018
RED," Disappointing in the extreme
","RED proved to me that a galaxy of (somewhat older) stars, brilliant cinematography of some of the USA's most colourful cities, and $58,000,000 doesn't necessarily make a great movie, and I say this as a big fan of Bruce Willis.I found it tedious and largely without coherence. There is a plot but it seemed very unfunny and uninteresting. The over-the-top gunfire scenes only heightened my irritation and clock-watching.Couldn't help thinking of another movie - Space Cowboys - where they got the oldies together for a special mission. Now that movie DID shine. I rated it an 8 (my SciFi bias no doubt), it had purpose and meaning, was quite interesting fiction, well executed and acted.I usually agree with the IMDb average vote but here I must differ sharply: a generous 3/10",3,2,9,17 March 2012
Life," Not bad but...
","So here we have another monster movie with an isolated group being picked off one-by-one by a monster of unbelievable intelligence and physical tenacity. For sci-fi geeks like me, the ISS as context lends appeal, but the movie overall doesn't overly appeal to the intelligence, being rather predictable..Arguably the most credible scenes are where the monster starts off as a dormant microscopic Martian organism. It always amazes me how such creatures (like in Promethesus) gain strength and size at a rate which beggars belief. At least 'Calvin' (the name selected by a school on Earth chosen from among 11,000) is seen to grow by feeding of its human hosts giving some plausibility.It's survival in airless space is somehow due to its ability (maybe like whales) to store oxygen, and somehow its tissues are durable enough to resist hard vacuum severe enough to pit aluminium.But the killer for me was the 'surprise' ending where David Jordan (Gyllenhaal), sacrificing himself to pilot a lifeboat with the creature into deep space and away from Earth, finds himself suddenly switched with Miranda North (Rebecca Ferguson) who is supposed safely returning to Earth. How the heck could that possibly happen??? Completely illogical and unsatisfying even if it gives the desired ending (Calvin gets to Earth and will presumably devour all humans..).Great CGI but once again demonstrating that sFX do not the movie make...",5,0,1,24 June 2017
