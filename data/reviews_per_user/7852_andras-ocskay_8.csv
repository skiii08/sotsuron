A Quiet Place," Its not horror. Slow scifi with monster
","I watched this bacause no dialogs.
I like when actors are acting not talk too much.I am happy to seen this experiment from director.Unfortunately I am not happy with the end scene as TOOOOO slow reactions what not makes dramatic tense, just made me tense.Some things I dont understood, what is writet and dramaturg mistke.
<ul><li>why have not built soundproof room</li><li>why haven have distraction sounds around the camp? Make a noise, and soon as the monster there make other sound for thise cases when people have to have make sounds, or done it by mistake. Eg: step in that nail. </li></ul>She has to shout, than they just turn distraction sounds other side of the farm, and launch some rockets to get away with it.
<ul><li>why they snad still when sound been made? Ok, made a sound, than run, leave the scene!!! This monster will come exactly where the sound was.</li></ul>The father try to help the kids and make sound, but why not strpnaway from the monster? Than make sound again?
It sinple as we played in our childhood one kid is blindfolded and others make sound. The blindfolded kid have to catch the others. Of course who makes sound try to hide and not stay sill. 6 years old kids know how to do this, so how could be dramaturg, writers and directors dont think of that?
<ul><li>the waterfall hide their sound. Why not deliver the baby there? There is water, loud sound, and safe. I dont understood.</li></ul>Without this dramaturg mistakes good film.",7,0,0,8 August 2018
Unknown," Cliché, flat story. Only two twist in unique, rest is BS.
","Very interesting idea, I was happy to see the start, but its was too lemonade already, than I see the twist, than got my interest.Than typical American fight scene.
The doctor who fight, so stupid director:/
Than car chasing scene. Typical and stupid as an American movie scene:/ It was bad to see:/
Doctor just got out from coma and fights, driving car in Berlin what He never saw.And stupid dramaturg wants us to believe the bad guys car go different way but shows up right next to them.
So bad useless driving around Berlin. Completely idiot who directed that action.And after all trouble the car still drivable?! And all of them walk away?!And by the way how they find Liam all the time?! He has hidden gps tracker in his brain?! Its so lame and childish.I was happy to see the start, it was interesting why they doubled, but this movie only have the good idea of this one thing, Dr Martin Harris (Liam) has a double somehow who also claim He is him.
That is the only good thing until the last twist what also brolliant. But the rest is flat cliché.I regret to see this destruction of a good idea:/Already bored when I seen the half of this film. Than two old spy meet scene, 'the communist spy swallows cyanide' wtf??!
American Cliché from 60's.
Could not believe this film can get any lower, but it did.Happy to see the end twist when they tell the truth, Matrin (Liam) just forgot he is an assasin and Martin just a cover story for him.
That is only the second good idea.
I cant be happy so long because a stupid action scene make me loosne my interest again.
And the falling car goes on flames without any reason. Why cars have to catch fire in US movies?Of course the professional assasination team has a bag with them filled with script and original (or other fake) passports?
Why should they carry that with them?At the cloak room she put 'secretly' a pandrive in a laptop. More like stupidly. Visible, and should not be planned like this. How she knows usb port is on that side of his laptop? And why sure the laptop is with him? And what if the laptopnhas no power? That was not realistic at all. Why not the cloak girl put that stupid pendrive there when they leave? Problem solved, realistic, and professional.In Hollywood movies bombs have to make sound also, and we have to see a timer. Why? Why they do that in Hollywood?At the same time when this sound making huge timer bomb counts down, Liam sneaks is, but Im not sure how, and try to tell there is a bomb. Well its two mistake here.
First, when he claims there is a bomb they have to take seriously, but they not take him as they think he is the crazy guy from yesterday.
Ok, buy why they start to check 3 months old video records? Why they do what mr america say?Happy to see bomb exploded.
After boom Liam got his head banged but He strong enough to fight no matter explosion and head injury.I regret to watch this film.
Too long and too flat.
Could be a good short film in 35-45 minutes. Waste of time and money",4,0,3,21 January 2019
Jurassic World," Low brain Hollywood movie with open mouth roaring monsters
","That bubble they travel stays on track even when monster trex spin them hard. Than a tiny turn amd they upside down and never spin back no matter what. Trex shake it amd they upside down.
Kids out without bang their head or scratch or pull a muscle or whiplash for shaking so hard.Motorbike in forest ground 40-50miles/hour? Congratulation...Abanodoned jurassic park scene (come on again?) and that building still not cleared out in 22 years.
Dinos roaring and making sounds again without reason.
They run and hunt and making sounds. That is not intelligent hunter. (That means the film makers not intelligent)Birds killing ppl in seconds with poke them. But they not leave with their food. Why not? 
One of them poke a helicopters widscreen together with that guy in a second but cany poke a human? As we saw on JP3 birds was so clamsy, probably they know main caracters in film should not be hurt.Raptors communicate wirh that huge mutant trex, and again, human gestures, and stupid sounds.
Not professional at all. 
Probably even Spielbergs grandkids making better sounds when plays with plastic dinos I guess.
But why they need to make sound anyway? Just stupid.And again raptors surrounds them in the end and nothing happen just staring. Big guy walks in just open mouth roaring again aimlessly.
..and one of the raptors ends in flame. (It should be exploded also haha)And two monsters fights the end, dont understand why (and not communicate in tbis time)
Monster ends in the aquarium with giant watermonster. And making sounds again.That would be the solution to bring the monster straight to the edge of the aquarium instead of put 4 raptors and a Trex in leash.Friendship between trex and raptor is really stupid, but we see the cherry on top when the Trex roaring in the end, again without reason.
(Aquarium idea was way much better)Its an expensive low brain Hollywood movie again as usual.
No brain, without thinking, without reason. But she run high heels in jungle in whole movie.",2,1,2,3 August 2018
Annihilation," Slow psy-fi
","Great movie!
Finaly I see something more realistic film!
No roaring monsters, 
nobody runs around with guns,
and (nearly) free from all hollywood crap.Just nearly Hollywood crap free. Too much cut, and art scenes could be longer, and get more attention. (Eg: Melancolia from Lars Von Trier)When they holding the glass, could be kept longer.
The bed scene could be one peace. I dont understant why they cut so much.I wish to see longer scenes with less cut. Theybare good actors, than lets see them in acting!Dont watch this movie if you love Hollywood action, and you think Bruce Wallace will save he world. 
Dont watch if you expect unrealisticly high geeky tech, or roaring alien monsters.Donwatch if you like slow movies, no music, silent acting instead of gunfire.By the way I wish to see less guns and explosions. That too much Hollycrap style.I am happy to seen this, cant wait till second and third part of the book will be on canvas.",10,0,2,7 August 2018
Jurassic Park," Fir kids who live in 90's
","Maybe in the 90's when I was kid have not seen how silly this movie.Clamsy storyline.
Action is lame, and so typical.
Exploding cars as usual in hollywood movies without reason.
Last minute rescue what is so lame.
Annoying music
This movie is bad. 
But what could I ecoect from Spilberg? One of the most commerce director.Good movie for ppl who like low quality And no brain",3,2,11,2 August 2018
