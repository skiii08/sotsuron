Requiem for a Dream," i liked it
","This movie's story isn't particularly fabulous (in fact, it's pretty one-dimensional) but I still found myself enthralled with the film.  The main draw for me was the frenetic, machine-like editing and clever foley sounds used during the 'unhealthy habit' sequences.  Few films have impressed me as greatly in terms of final effect; the nightmarish spiral engaged by the characters will stay with you, almost hauntingly, long after you watch Requiem For a Dream.",Null,0,0,13 September 2001
