Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," My Least Favorite 'Star Wars'
","This is my least favorite 'Star Wars', as the head line states. Why? Because this film is full of flaws, not physical flaws; duologue and character flaws. First things first, why did they have to do Jar-Jar Binks, he keeps an annoying presence in whatever scene he is in, that it is almost tiring. Second, knowing what he's going to be, you have to take him seriously and young Jedis and future Sith people don't 'whoopie' and 'oops' what are you going to send him too? Preschool? Third, the cartoony look of the bad guy, I mean, he looks like a costumed guy in Disney World! If you want the audiences to be scared of a bad guy you can't make them imagine him next to Mickey Mouse! This truly is the worst 'Star Wars' movie.",5,0,2,23 August 2007
Casablanca," Deserves It's Rank
","I had seen many films, but none were like Casablanca, it's duologue never failed, and it can touch the hearts of many without being too too touchy and romantic. It also has many plot lines, which is no mistake to the directors, because for some of them, it answers them as soon as you see them, it answers them in the middle, it leaves it for the end, or cliff hangs you on with not a single intention for a sequel. Besides, a sequel will destroy it's premise. While many actors are excellent in the supporting cast, Humphrey Bogart is spectacular as the selfish, money loving, one-woman, man, but gets his heart at the end. It's shocking that he didn't win the Oscar, (well he was nominated.) And this film never gets too predictable, when you pause, you still look at the single frame, looking for clues. This film is to be enjoyed for people of all ages, for the present and future.",10,3,6,26 May 2007
Forrest Gump," Not THE Greatest But Still Great
","In the reviews I read for this film I'm surprised no one has mentioned the classic Being There (1979), Peter Sellers 2nd to last film, because there are many similarities between the two, to some extent as completely stealing from the film (they both are devoid of the racism and greed around because them, etc.).Now with Robert Zemeckis, the man behind the Back to the Future trilogy and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, you expect a great film, and Forrest Gump is. But it does NOT deserve to be in the top 50. For instance, I find very hard to believe that Forrest could be at so many important events at such small period of time. Also if his legs are so strong wouldn't his good balance keep his back from being so crooked (I'm no chiropractor so it could be plausible). I also find it hard to believe about Forrest's and Jenny's relationship, she only sees him when she's in need. Now lets focus on the positives: special effects are awesome, you can easily believe he is there. Tom Hanks does an excellent performance as Forrest, which makes the special effects even more believable. So if you have three hours to spare Forrest Gump is an excellent choice to watch.",7,1,3,29 September 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Overrated. Overrated. Did I Mention Overrated?
","As of this writing, Benjamin Button is number 70 on IMDb's Top 250 movies of the year list. Many people believe this film deserves, in a year with films like Frost/Nixon and Doubt (and many others which I will not mention) that this is the one film which will bring home Best Picture.Wow. This is overrated. It will bring home the Oscars it deserves: Cinematography and Makeup, and if it's very, very, lucky, Special Effects. What bugs me most about the film is the thing at the core: the relationship between Daisy and Benjamin. It misses something very, very, important: why they fell in love in the first place.The most interesting section is one that completely captivated: when he has a love affair with a lady at the Russian hotel, why? Because they kept it at a brisk 30 minutes so it doesn't drag on for 2 hours, it gets you captivated, and it ends when it is meant to end. You can also tell why they had the affair in the first place: they wanted to find out to what it was like to be in love, or in the girls case: Benjamin's strange affliction.You (or at least me) become sick of Benjamin's relationship with Daisy when you realize it fails to ask the most important question at what is the dead center of the entire 2 hour 48 minute film: Why did they fall in love???Pitt gives a tolerable performance, nothing Oscar worthy. Blanchett, on the other hand was very good as Daisy, trying to fuel the chemistry with Pitt that just isn't there.It's also very long with a 168-minute runtime, it thinks it can spend all the time trying to win, but in the end, it fails. There are many useless scenes that could've been thrown out (particularly this one scene in which it shows all the things, which could've happened to prevent Daisy being hit by a cab, which leaves you thinking in the 5-minute section that feels more like 30 minutes which left me thinking 'when will this end???'). Worth a rental for the astounding cinematography and makeup.",7,60,107,31 December 2008
The Dark Knight," The Best Superhero Movie Ever Made, And Also One of the Best Movies Ever Made
","Wow. Just Wow. This films amazing, not just as a superhero movie but as a movie period. Christian Bale does an excellent job as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Morgan Freeman does an excellent job as Wayne's technology guy, almost everybody does a great job in the film except for Lt. Gordons family, gosh his bratty kid was annoying.Now Heath Ledger's performance deserves a section to itself, I would be more than happy to sign any petition for him to get a posthumous Oscar, it's a shame he had to die so prematurely and as soon as his career was beginning to start. Because trying to top a role originally done by Jack Nicholson is not easy at all, but Ledger does it. He brings to the Joker a disturbing and confused character, but nonetheless human at the same time.Kudos should also go to director Christopher Nolan for making a radical departure from different superhero films, Batman is not trying to save the 'good people of Gotham' the people of Gotham are selfish and greedy and ready to kill one another for survival. Batman himself is not portrayed as a hero.All in all The Dark Knight was a great film.",7,3,7,23 July 2008
WALLÂ·E," Not In the Top 25 But Still Great
","Does Wall-E, the newest film in the Disney/Pixar cannon, a bit preachy at parts? Yes. Did some of the themes become to much in one scene? Yes. Do some characters get extremely annoying? Yes. Will it probably be the greatest film this year? Heck yes. Considering the rental-and-nothing-else value of Hancock and Get Smart.I walked into the theater thinking that it wouldn't be thought-provoking, I just expected a cute 110-minute film. But I did become thought-provoked. Especially when there portraying humanity in 800 years as obese, mind-numbed, and idiotic and relying on machines to do all the labor is pretty interesting, considering that most of us can't find our own home without a GPS. Also with a corporation (Big'N'Large or simply BNL) taking over government and consumerism (think Wal-Mart taking over the world) is just another factor showing humanity's empty-headed materialism.I also think Wall-E was Disney's best character since Woody in Toy Story a truly memorable sci-fi epic.",10,1,2,5 July 2008
The Truman Show," Excellent Jim Carrey Movie
","This film literally changed my thoughts about reality television. The nonviolent cruelty placed on Truman is something that he doesn't realize will surprise you. And Truman doesn't notice he being cruelly treated. The director of the show (I forget who played him) was excellent in his role as the man who would try to kill the thing that made him famous. The roles are great, but Jim Carrey, however, was superb in his role as the clueless celebrity who everyone stares at. And this is a Jim Carrey film so you know it's packed with laughs, the funniest is when the director (noticing Truman's at the end of his little world) is talking to him with a loud, deep voice (he sounds like God) coming from the sky is hilarious, it's not flawless, but it's extremely good.",10,1,2,13 May 2007
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," The Funniest Film Ever Made
","This is pretty much a King Arthur story with a knee-slapping-It's-So-Funny-Ending. Monty Python did a hilarious work of art which most comedians have seen a billion times. The films starts out with a horseless King Arthur (instead banging two coconuts together.) looking for knight to join his new organization The Kinghts Of The Round Table, after a guard explains logic to him, it gets downright hilarious from there. If it won an award it would probably be 'A Comedy You Saw 12 Billion Times But Still Laugh At.' Kids would also love this film even if they never heard of King Arthur, don't leave them with some High School Musical crap or something. This, in my opinion, is definitely a must-see no matter what age you are.",9,0,1,22 April 2007
Beetlejuice," One of the Most Imaginative Movies Ever Made
","There are few films to exceed the imagination of Beetlejuice, King Kong, maybe Wizard of Oz, but then we must remember that this film is much darker than Wizard of Oz. It's here and Batman that Micheal Keaton is at his finest, his (or at least IMDb trivia states) eighteen minute appearance is not bad by horror-comedy standards. And black humor is very relevant throughout, and the ending, where we have a creepy Beetlejuice and a non-dead dying couple is suspense-loaded. And the other ghouls are some of the most imaginative things in film to date.It's not the greatest movie ever, but it's certainly the most imaginative.",8,1,2,16 August 2007
