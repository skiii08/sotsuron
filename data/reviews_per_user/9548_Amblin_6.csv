Scarface," 'Say hello to my little friend!'
","Brian DePalma's epic drug flick 'Scarface' is quite an intriuging insight into the billion dollar drug trade in the US. With Pacino in the title role as Tony Montana (AKA Scarface), a Cuban refugee who hits the big time with the drug trade in Miami, who would've thought this flick wouldn't be something special. Montana is a cold blooded businessman.....which is what you have to be in the business he's in! DePalma's direction of Pacino is extremely entertaining, from his impressive Cuban accent to his strong body movements, DePalma has crafted his lead in a way that would put most mob bosses to shame. Although Oliver Stone's electric screenplay is somewhat overlong, it still does present some great scenes to be remembered. Pacino gives us a character who in spite of his small frame, exerts more power and finness than any other character in the film. His obsession with the word 'f**k' presents some comedic results, when his wife (played by a young Michelle Pfeiffer) pleads 'Can you please stop saying 'f**k' all the time!'. The killings in Scarface are quite imaginative, and not just the common mafia style we're used to in other movies. Stone's scripted killings range from hanging one of Montana's supposed partners        (F. Murray Abraham) from a helicopter and chopping another one of Montana's partner's hand and leg off with a chainsaw to the cool-looking shooting guys in the forehead from point blank range and blowing guys up with grenade launchers. In spite of this apparent brutality, Stone does deliver each killing in a unique way.....proving that there are more ways to dispose of an unwanted individual. As Montana rises to the throne of the Miami drug business, he makes mortal enemies, who in a final bloody showdown in Montana's coke-smothered (and be warned, there is a s**t load of coke in this movie!) mansion, deliver his self-inflicted end. Scarface is a brutal story of a man who wanted it all, and got it too.....but was brought down because of it. Just remember 'Say hello to my little friend!'.",Null,0,0,29 April 1999
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," YOU try topping the $913 million 1993 blockbuster!
","I must admit, after viewing The Lost World I felt like I had just experienced a below-par Steven Spielberg film. But, I DO NOT blame him, for the creative genius is at work in this film. The main reason the failure of the movie is the story. A clear indication was given that Michael Crichton was probably pressured into writing a sequel novel just for the sake of another movie. The story seems very rushed, sort of a last minute job. It was going to be hard to top 1993's original hit, so you can't really expect it to be better. The Lost World has its moments as the Spielberg touch is there, such as the raptors creeping up behind the party in the long grass.....but there are so little moments of coolness that you'll think this is just regurgitating the 1993 flick's ideas. The visual effects have improved since 1993, so the dinos (especially the raptors) have much greater movement, which can look good.....but the terror isn't there. The original movie was quite frightening (much like Jaws), but this sequel isn't quite as frightening. It's more like a CG feast. But overall, Spielberg tried with what he had, and got a less than average response. When you have a blockbuster that was as big as Jurassic Park was in 1993, it's extremely hard to top it.",6,0,1,7 April 1999
Con Air," The epitome of action.
","Con Air must be said to be a genuine action flick. Jerry Bruckheimer really knows how to impress his audience, with previous action hits like The Rock and Top Gun, and now Con Air. Scott Rosenberg's electric screenplay is the aspect of Con Air that really sets it alone. Smart, inventive, and downright entertaining, Rosenberg presents a story that takes us back to films like The Wild Bunch and the Dirty Dozen, where we get to know all the characters and get to like them all too. Bruckheimer and director Simon West really pile on the hardware, and make Con Air one of the most appealing and best looking films of 1997. The aspect of maximum security prisoners- including murderers, rapists, and serial killers- really appeals to teenage audiences. But despite their crimes, the characters become quite lovable, which then turns Con Air into an action/comedy. Spectacular action scenes on the plane, in the desert, and most importantly, Las Vegas, really make Con Air a top action movie. Although containing some love scenes, it doesn't drag Con Air down much more than any other movie. Con Air's film editing is quick and effective, adding another action movie aspect to it. Con Air really gets the audience involved in the movie, and never lets the audience stop and think. It's real in-your-face action, which never lets up. Con Air is really a prime example of the action genre.",8,1,2,5 September 1998
The Matrix," Has its moments, but so very few of them.
","I was looking forward to seeing this flick, but was extremely disappointed when my hopes and aspirations disappeared into cyberspace just like The Matrix itself. Although the Warner/Village action/sci-fi does have its moments, most of the movie is just mindless computer hacking, computer talk, and make-believe environments made by computers. It reminded me of Johnny Mnemonic (yet another Keanu Reeves action/sci-fi). People have been bragging about the visual effects, but I'm thinking 'What is there to brag about anyway?'. The Sydney skyline is ever so recognizable, even though the makers attempted to cover it up by taking out certain landmarks. It's easy to see that the majority of this flick was shot in a studio, because 90% of it is dark and in-doors. It's also funny to note that the bad agents, aptly named Agent Smith and Agent Jones, dress like the MIB and have the same surnames as the actors who played them. The helicopter crash sequence was the only thing (apart from the gun fight in the lobby) that really stood out. You can understand why the ads for this movie just showed that chopper crashing into the building.....because what else is there to brag about?!",7,0,1,8 April 1999
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," This is what movies are all about!
","Pure entertainment. A simple description of this legendary Steven Spielberg film. John Williams' unbelievable score captures the sense of adventure! I love it. The widescreen version tops everything......stunning visuals. Spielberg's direction is pure genius, capturing the turbulent father-son relationship between Ford and Connery. This nearly equals Raiders for sheer excitement and adventure. Keep making movies like this!",9,0,0,7 April 1999
Jurassic Park," Epitomises the title 'A STEVEN SPIELBERG FILM'.
","What can one say after witnessing one of the greatest motion pictures of all time? The creative genius has done it again, by simply returning to the thriller genre that shot him to fame with Jaws.....with the same intensity and thrills. But this time around, Spielberg has the aid of CGI...which made JP such a landmark film. Using the visual effects, Steven has captured the imagination of the entire planet, making JP the most successful film of all time (until 1998). He has tapped into the audience's greatest fears, and used them against us to a horrifying degree. Who can forget the terrifying T-Rex first lumbering out of her enclosure, and don't forget her chasing the tour jeep! This is the ultimate Steven Spielberg film......if ever there was one......an adventure/thriller surpassed by no other. Seeing this for the first time in 1993 when I was only 11 years old....it scared the crap out of me. I couldn't sleep for a week....let alone eat properly. I am proud to be part of the JP phenomenon....as it certainly defined a Steven Spielberg film. As always, his direction of the characters is unique, and will never be rivalled.....never. Just take a look at character reactions to the dinosaurs, and especially the apparent misunderstandings between Alan and Tim. John Williams' score is awesome.....once again defining a Spielberg film. Williams' originality in the thriller genre has also been revisited 18 years after Jaws. Michael Kahn's film editing in the continuity aspect of things is the only flaw, where one can immeadiately pick up on his mistakes.....although, there are not many, the mistakes sure do stand out like a sore thumb. In spite of this, the continuity doesn't let the film down.....as the common movie-goer rarely picks up on editing mistakes (thank God!) especially in a movie like this when you're more concerned about crapping your pants  for 120 mins straight. Overall, JP is a gem when it comes to thriller film-making.....it epitomises the genre and the credit 'A Steven Spielberg Film'. It's not hard to understand why this monster movie made $913 million at the box office.",9,1,1,29 April 1999
