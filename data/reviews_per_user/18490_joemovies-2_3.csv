The Incredible Hulk," Definitely Not A Bore
","I believe this version of the Hulk is to eliminate viewers memories from the first Hulk directed by Ang Lee. Definitely A LOT BETTER and more entertaining. It is a must see for Hulk fans and trust me you won't be yawning. I think you shouldn't even bother with the Ang Lee version and should consider this version as part 1 and not sequel to the other version. I would consider this version as a remake, a second chance to make it right.I also like edward norton and believe he is a great actor. He did a good job. I am looking forward to see more sequels of the Hulk and hopefully it'll be directed by top guys such as Sam raimi, Wolfgang petersen or my FAV James Cameron.",7,2,6,14 June 2008
Kung Fu Panda," Definitely worth the wait
","This animation i have to say is one of the best i've seen and i'm not a fan of pixar type 3D animation (ie Find Nemo, Shrek etc...) since they're too much for kids. But this animation is worth the hype and the wait. Not only is it entertaining/funny but also has a moral to the story which we all should learn from (both adults and children).The graphics is excellent, story is simple/typical (aren't majority of them nowadays) but the moral included makes this animation not only for kids but for everyone.Generally i don't want any sequels to be made since they are just for money grabbing reasons but for this one i hope they make a trilogy since i really LOVE PO.",8,4,5,18 June 2008
Twilight," Like a straight board
","All i can say about this movie is that it is like a board, in other words its like someone telling you a story but keeping at the same pace all the way through. No excitement or any parts that keeps you on the edge of your seat. I haven't read the book yet but i believe if this was directed by someone with better potential the movie will be more than just a chick's flick. I don't know if either the director was fired or not but its a good they changed it to Paul Weitz (American Pie, Golden Compass). I believe he'll most probably will do a better job. However i'm looking forward to the third movie directed by David Slade (30 days of night). That is what a vampire movie should be. 30 days of night was a simple but entertaining flick. Also the actors especially the main actress i'm looking forward to the day she wins an Oscar (if she ever will even get close to any nominations). All the way through the movie its like she's repeating the same actions over & over. They should just get her to act one scene then reuse that scene all the way through the movie.For me i don't really care much about the acting or the actors in a movie as long as they suit their characters (dont' expect them to be Oscar winners) because the actors/actresses only have about 10% impact on the movie. Most important is getting the RIGHT DIRECTOR telling the story in a way that keeps the audience coming out pleased.",5,0,2,27 October 2009
