Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not bad
","The fourth chapter in the 'Star Wars' saga is not as bad as it's reputation would suggest but's it nothing to critically laud and rave about either.Set 32 years before the first film, the story (if you want to call it that) tells us the origins of iconic characters Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenboi and Yoda among others while introducing new faces such as Mace Windu and Padmae Amidala who all play important roles in shaping the events of the original trilogy.The performers are pretty good. The all-star cast includes some of my favorite actors including the lovely Natalie Portman and the great pros Frank Oz and Samuel L. Jackson. Other performers like Liam Neeson are OK but not spectacular. And although underused, Ray Park makes a silently menacing villain in Darth Maul.The cons are not too bad but are pretty big blunders nonetheless. The CGI is terrible, it looks too artificial and distracts from the actors and the 'story' and speaking of which, how much more convoluted can this script get? The first three films were so crystal clear in their stories and the characters and here, your left out in the cold. Last but by no means least...the presence of Jar Jar Binks. Need I say more? All in all, while not a classic it stands as a piece of history (for the useless hype) but it's not half bad. One last observation: what would the film have been like if Sam Jackson played Mace like Zeus from 'Die Hard 3'?",5,0,5,4 October 2009
Batman Returns," The best of all the Batmans
","This sequel proves that Tim Burton was for all intents and purposes THE best choice to ever direct a Batman movie. The story focuses on Baman taking on three enemies: The Penguin (wonderfully played by Danny DeVito) Catwoman (the slinky Michelle Pfeiffer) and Max Shreck (the superb Christopher Walken).Perhaps the best entry in the series, it has it all: complex themes, complex characters and a dark tone that truly stands out. The cast is simply wonderful although the obvious stand-out is DeVito as the multi-layered Penguin. Here is a guy who is evil, pitiable, funny and perhaps most importantly, scary. The infamous scene with Shreck's image consultants still sends shivers up my spine. In other words, the cast is simply a joy to watch and all turn in first rate performances.I do not hesitate to say that 'Batman Returns' is my favorite of all the Batmans released (sorry, Dark Knight fans). If you want a superhero film that has a little more to offer besides flashy effects and big scale action, then please check out this badly underrated film. If nothing else, it's at least the best film Tim Burton has ever made.",10,32,64,16 May 2009
The Jungle Book," My all-time favorite Disney film
","Off all the Disney animated movies from 1937 to the present, 'The Jungle Book' has always stood out as something special. This movie is quite simply FUN. There is no romance, no attempt to break new ground with it's effects, no dramatics and none of the hokey 'if you dream it, you can be it' bull. This movie succeeds in it's simple goal to bypass all that and just entertain you.The story is inspired by the classic books written by Rudyard Kipling. We follow the man-cub Mowgli (voiced by Bruce Reitherman in an appealing performance) as he treks from the jungle to the man-village. Along the way he encounters a strange parade of figures including the sniveling Kaa (voiced by the great Sterling Holloway), the evil Shere Khan (George Sanders) and the rambunctious King Louie (Louis Prima, who gets the film's best song).His two parental figures are Baloo the Bear and the sage Bagaheera. They are voiced by Phil Harris and Sebastian Cabot and their chemistry together really makes the triangle of Mowgli, the bear and the panther really work. It is probably the most dysfunctional family ever seen in a Disney film.Everything else works just fine. The songs are cute and catchy, the characters interact well with each other, the setting is stylish and the ending is a departure from the clichÃ©d happy ending. This one feels more ambiguous but altogether more satisfying.Although there are some things that will make P.C. nuts squawk (the alleged racism) and the animation buffs cringe (the reused animation) that doesn't change the fact that 'The Jungle Book' is fun, unique, jolly, and full of heart.",10,0,1,13 June 2010
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The best of the series
","Yes, I freely admit that I consider this the grand champion of the series. 'A New Hope' was pretty good and 'The Empire Strikes Back' was good but not great. For my money, 'Return of the Jedi' is the one to beat.The plot ties up all the stories and loose ends that we've seen develop and also provides the best ending in any of these six films. The others either ended on an overblown note or a bittersweet one. 'Jedi' has a nice, subtle happy ending. The story this time is that the Death Star II is nearing completion which leads to a final showdown between the Empire and the Rebels. While all this is going on, Luke becomes determined to redeem the soul of his father-Darth Vader.The performers are simply terrific. Mark Hamill does a great job (probably his best on-camera performance) Carrie Fisher turns in another great job as the beautiful yet spunky Princess Leia and Harrison Ford, although somewhat superfluous to the main story, turns in another first rate job.The veteran actors- Alec Guinness, Sebastian Shaw and Ian McDiarmid- are all perfect although I consider Shaw to be the stand-out. Last but not least, Frank Oz as Yoda who goes out with one of the best death scenes ever.With a few exceptions (the Ewoks, the slave girl outfit) this is a fantastic film with great characters, slick special effects and a touching story. Plus some good old fashioned puppet effects bringing our favorite space slug, Jabba the Hutt, to life.In short, 'Jedi' rules.",10,2,5,7 June 2009
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The worst of the series
","The fifth installment in the 'Star Wars' series features quite a laborious and convoluted plot that begs for not just a re-write but a shot of alcohol.Picking up ten years after 'The Phantom Menace', Anakin and Obi-Wan face new challenges with the rise of a mysterious new villain known as Count Dooku (played by the magnificent Christopher Lee). Easily, he saves this film from total disaster. And keep in mind, this is just a loose summary of the film. If I tried to explain the whole thing, we'd be here forever as the plot holes are as big as skyscrapers.Not to slight anyone, the whole cast redeems this film. Natalie Portman, Samuel L. Jackson, Frank Oz, and all the others keep things moving but even their talents can barely overcome the flat dialog, wooden line deliveries and a truly bad lead performance by Hayden Christensen as Anakin.All in all, this is the least of the series but the lulls are redeemed by this great cast, most especially by Lee.",3,2,5,5 October 2009
Edward Scissorhands," One of Burton's best
","Let me start by saying Tim Burton is my all-time favorite director. All of his films deal with the shy outcast who struggles to fit into society, usually with mixed results and 'Edward Scissorhands' is probably Burton's greatest achievement.An artificial man (masterfully played by Johnny Depp) is taken from his secluded, castle home to modern day suburbia by a cheery saleslady. From there, the film becomes a fairy tale with Edward falling in love with a young cheerleader played by the gifted Winona Ryder.Burton brings so much to this film. It's production design is wondrous, the cast is a joy (with an amusing cameo by Vincent Price) and the story is well told. The fact the film also has a non-traditional ending makes it all the more unique.A modern masterpiece.",10,1,2,4 October 2009
Batman Begins," Batman is back
","Eight years after the travesty known as 'Batman & Robin' Christopher Nolan (admittedly a bad choice for director) redeems the series and tells us the origin of Batman.The movie serves as a very loose prequel to the first four films (in my view) and shows Bruce Wayne becoming Batman and facing his first enemies in the form of a terrorist organization called The League of Shadows.Although not perfect, the film is pretty damn good. The cast performs very well (except for Katie Holmes who is especially grating) and the film has plenty of action and mild humor that offsets the former nicely.However, the realistic tone seems a little off to me. Why do Batman realistically? Seems kind of pointless. The voice that Christian Bale uses as Batman sounds more laughable then scary and the film lacks solidity slightly. The origin story is well-told although the build-up to Batman's first appearance might cause some to grumble and the action scenes are pretty poorly staged.But none of this griping means the film isn't entertaining. If you haven't seen it, check it out.",8,0,0,11 June 2010
Ghostbusters," Still hilarious after all these years
","This was THE comedy of the 1980s. Combine four great comedic talents with some of the best cheesy special effects and a clever idea and what do you have? You have 'Ghostbusters.'The story concerns three scientists who, after being fired from the university they work for, set up shop as paranormal exterminators and soon find themselves battling enemies both human and supernatural. This film defies words. It's funny, clever, very well-made, and exquisitely performed by this merry group of performers ranging from Rick Moranis to William Atherton and Ernie Hudson. The climax with Stay Puft fits the bizarre and comical atmosphere.There really are no flaws for me personally. This moves at a good pace, is never crass, and has all these wonderful talents playing off each other really well. If you haven't seen it by now, do yourself a favor and see it.",10,1,2,14 November 2009
The Dark Knight," Overrated but by no means terrible
","The sixth installment in the 'Batman' series features the return of the greatest villain to ever hit the funny pages...The Joker (well-played by Heath Ledger) This time around, Batman faces multiple challenges: trying to juggle his public image with his bat antics, facing new villains such as the Joker and Two-Face and the constant explosions being set off by the former.This film has quite a lot going for it. It's superbly acted by the cast with no real quibbles save the ridiculous voice Bale chooses to use for Batman. The effects are serviceable and the movie moves at a good pace. But....There are plenty of flaws. The film is a little too talky in its final ten minutes and it doesn't really help that Bale does most of the speaking. The plot is a bit too convoluted, reminding me of how jumbled 'Spider-Man 3' was. I also can't stand the horrid way the fight scenes were shot. I can't make out whose hitting who and the fact most of the fights take place at night certainly doesn't help.The problems aside, this is one of the best interpretations of Batman's struggle with The Joker.",8,2,3,4 October 2009
2001: A Space Odyssey," Tedious in the extreme
","This is a Stanely Kubrick 'classic' and I use the term very loosely as this film is both unbelievably tedious and boring.The film in broken into segments starting with the evolution of Man and a subsequent space mission gone awry. Sprinkled among these four parts is some of the flattest acting you will ever see which is strange because Kubrick was a master at getting the best out of his actors. The only two cast members that add any life to it are Douglas Rain as the voice of HAL 9000 and Vivian Kubrick as the adorable daughter of Floyd.The film is many things: long, slow, meandering, flat and redundant. These negative traits affect almost everything the film has to offer from the story to the performances and the score. The only thing NOT affected is the special effects which are pretty convincing.In conclusion, although the story has promise and it sparkles every now and then, the film is just plain dull.",4,8,16,5 October 2009
Alice in Wonderland," Very entertaining but somewhat lacking
","The idea of Tim Burton directing a live action/animated crossbreed of the famed nonsense story 'Alice in Wonderland' seems like a match made by the arch angels of cinema heaven and even though the final result is pretty good, you can't help but feel a sense of botched potential.The story is slightly tweaked from Lewis Carroll's original. Thirteen years after her original visit, Alice is lured back to Wonderland (or Underland, apparently) in order to fulfill her destiny: slay the monstrous Jabberwocky.First off, this film has many great virtues: the visual style is perfect (with Burton nicely contrasting the real and fantasy worlds), there's a shipload of great performances, and the movie moves at a good pace. Plus, it's fun to see the the magnificent Christopher Lee and Michael Gough in a movie again.However, on the whole, there's something amiss. Although fun and entertaining, it's sad that Burton didn't just do a straight version of the original book. On top of that, Johnny Depp turns in a shockingly two-dimensional performance and the infamous 'futterwacken dance' is a little out of place.Overall, 'Alice in Wonderland' is something special but feels a little empty.",6,5,9,16 April 2010
Titanic," Does not hold up well twelve years later
","This is, without question, one of the most overblown movies of the last twenty years. This is a romantic retelling of the infamous sinking and who do we have as stars? Two pretty people (Leo and Kate) who will never be compared to Clark and Vivian but nobody's perfect.This is a real hit and miss film. The cons are just huge: the framing story is completely unnecessary, the story is so stilted, and the whole set-up prior to the climax is just boring. Not really helping matters is that the love story seems recycled from a Lifetime TV movie.The pros are minor but save it from complete disaster. The ship sinking climax is very well done and loaded with tension, some of the cast members do very well (a good example being Victor Garber as the kindly Thomas Andrews) but I think special mention should go to David Warner as the cruel valet, Spicer Lovejoy. Warner steals every scene he's in and his death scene at the ship splitting is simply priceless.Although it doesn't hold up particularly well and is certainly no masterpiece, it's OK overall.",3,5,9,5 October 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The best of the prequels (but not by much)
","The saga is now complete with 'Revenge of the Sith' which ties up most of the loose ends and leads into the original trilogy nicely but the results are still a mixed bag.Basically, the story details the fall of the Republic and the Jedi Order and shows the ultimate fates of most characters such as Mace Windu and leaving behind the classic characters (Darth Vader, C-3PO, and Obi-Wan) who pick up the action in 'Star Wars.' This is easily the most elaborate and, dare I say, the most well-acted of the newer films with some very slick CGI effects.However, at times the CGI is a bit too slick. A more appropriate title for this would have been 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit 2' as pretty much everything on screen is animated. All we need is Bob Hoskins and we've got the long delayed sequel. But the only true sour note is Hayden Christensen, delivering yet another painfully bad performance.All these quibbles aside, this is a triumph overall and stands as the best of the prequels. I just wish they had gotten Tim Burton to direct.",5,1,3,5 October 2009
Space Jam," Pretty good
","This movie has received a lot of flak over the last couple of years and I honestly don't know why. OK, it's not terrific or a masterpiece, but it does accomplish one simple goal: it's entertaining.The plot concerns Michael Jordan (playing himself and proving to be a rather charming actor) who, after retiring from basketball, finds himself roped (literally) into helping Bugs Bunny and the Looney Tunes in a do or die game against aliens. Sound ridiculous? It is but this is the Looney Tunes, not '2001.'The pros are pretty significant. The cast performs well (with Wayne Knight and Bill Murray stand-outs), the animation is colorful and lively and the comedy concerning the now-talentless NBA players is really a treat with a particular shout-out going to Albert Hague who plays a psychiatrist. Let's also mention the phenomenal soundtrack which I will never fault this film for.Although it lacks solidity and most of the live action scenes without the Tunes are pretty dull, overall I enjoyed it. And I still do almost fourteen years later.",5,2,5,25 April 2010
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," One of the best
","The definitive space fantasy follows a ragtag group of freedom fighters as they try to rescue a beautiful princess from the forces of evil and take down a criminal empire.Despite this rather standard story, this movie has become legendary, setting the standards that all fantasy/sci-fi movies have tried to emulate but rarely with any success. Although it has its problems, I love this film.The cast is pretty good with old pros Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing the stand-outs while Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford play the very opposite but steadfast friends Luke Skywalker and Han Solo. I also must give special credit to my favorite actress, the spunky Carrie Fisher, giving one of her best performances as the so-called 'damsel in distress' Princess Leia. They all drive this story home.The film is not without its flaws. The pace is fairly slow and some of the action scenes are surprisingly dull with the exception of the Death Star climax which is a knock-out.All in all, this is one of the best and will likely inspire audiences and filmmakers alike forevermore.",7,0,0,4 October 2009
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," A good sequel
","This sequel to 'Star Wars' is good but not great and although a tad overrated, it still delivers.Three years have passed since the first film and the rebels are being hunted by Darth Vader while Luke Skywalker trains in the ways of the Force under the guidance of Yoda. Han Solo and Princess Leia take the time out to have a clichéd romance on Cloud City and at the end, we get the ultimate twist ending which I won't spoil for newbies.This is grand entertainment with a dark tone, great performances and one heck of a light-saber duel but the cons are there. Some of the battle scenes are protracted and uninteresting, the romance subplot is boring and clichéd and the story as a whole lacks solidity.There are two new faces this time who add plenty of spice. Billy Dee Williams is simply cool as Lando and Frank Oz delivers a fantastic job as Yoda. Watching this, I truly believe that Oz should have been nominated for an Oscar. He got us to care and root for a puppet, something CGI has never done successfully, at least not for me.Bottom line, even though it lacks solidity and is a bit overrated, this is one hell of a sequel.",7,1,4,5 October 2009
