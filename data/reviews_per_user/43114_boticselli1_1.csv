Ford v Ferrari," Great movie from an another age...
","Great movie from an another age...
... an era, when there was no computer assisted driving aids (ABS, ASR, etc).
When there was no climate change hysteria, no pc-culture.
When man's was masculine, women's was feminine, and nobody mixed up things.
Mat Damon and Christian Belle are gorgeous.Ps.:
In the movie Ken Miles wife, Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) was a big, heart warming surprise for me.
She loved her husband till the very end, and support him in good and bad times well.
It is very hard to find a woman like her, these days...
She still loved and support her husband, when he told her that they lost everything, and they are broke as can be...
The IRS closed down the garage, etc...The '60s...
Another times, another world, another moral.",10,11,26,15 November 2019
