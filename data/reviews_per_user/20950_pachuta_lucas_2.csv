Black Swan," Psycho, Sexual thriller is what it is!!!
","This is movie portrays what is said about itself 'Wicked Psycho Sexual Thriller'. This movie follows a Ballet dancer named Nina. Her mind and body is devoted to dancing and to perfecting everything about her dancing. Through out the movie she is constantly competing against her sanity. Along with her sanity on line she is beginning to feel she is losing her part in the production of Swan lake, to a dance sister named Lily. If it wasn't enough pressure on Nina to have to deal with her sanity, that could soon be gone, and losing her role in the play, she goes home to a unstable mom. Her mom is lost in her own failure as a dancer and can not accept the fact she never made it. Nina's mom blames it on her that she never made it has a dancer. She wants her to succeed so bad that she pushes Nina to hard. The Relationship between Nina and Lily in this movie is extremely intense, passionate, provocative and mentally thrilling. Lily seems to take advantage of Nina's situation and send Nina done an even darker path of her own destruction. Lily please a creepy and sexual character, yet at times she is just a regular friendly girl that does nothing wrong. Nina in this situation starts to blame her problems and struggles on Lily and that Lily is trying to get her out of the show and take her place as the lead ballet dancer dong the White and Black Swan.Nina is trying to make sure she can keep it together. She is constantly being told to let go by her director, but she is so obsessed with making everything absolutely perfect she can't let go. Nina's life is now on the line because she is going insane over the need she has to make her dancing perfect. This movie was a great film and I would recommend it to anyone who likes Darren Aronofsky's movies. This movie, I believe was not as good as Requiem For a Dream because I didn't feel there was enough story and enough character information given. Like why did Nina pick to fear Lily from the beginning what reasoning did she have for Lily? Why did Lily come to this place to dance what did she do prior to dancing at this studio? A little more information about what the mom went through when Nina was growing up? If there was a little more depth to the characters i think the movie would easily be a 10/10 but i am giving it a 8.5/10.",8,9,19,18 December 2010
127 Hours," A must see film of the 21st Century
","I remember going through the discussion board on IMDb and I came a crossed a message that said what movies will be remembered 60 years from now? I had a very short list of movies for this board but I can safely say I can add one more to that list and it's called '127 Hours.' This movie is a spectacular collaboration of emotional images, mental break downs, and the power of the human will to live. This movie grabs your attention right from the beginning and moves your butt right to the edge of the seat. You will be stuck there staring at the screen until the very end and then and only then you will finally sit back in relief. I wouldn't normally do a spoiler review but in his case I am because it is a true story and through out the movie you know the ending. This is a sign of a create film because you know the ending but yet you can't look away from the screen where in most cases, when you now the end of a movie it becomes uninteresting. This movie is more than just watching a man try to make it out of what seems to be an impossible situation to survive. James Franco did an absolutely amazing job at playing the role of Aron Ralston and really showing what went through his mind during the 127 hours he was trapped. When Aron started to hallucinate he saw his family, friends, and a love he once had. He would flashback to all the great times he had with all of them and he would break down every time a little more inside yet give him the strength to stay alive. He had even given up and it seemed he was done. He video taped himself during a psycho break down, doing a talk show with himself has he played all the characters. He began to talk about how stupid he was to not tell anyone where he was going. He talked about how even his friend Chris wouldn't know he was gone till the weekend. Even if Chris reported him missing police can't take action for 24 hours and at that point he would be dead for sure. After he was finished with his break down video he snapped back to reality. He started thanking his parents for everything they had done for him and that he wishes that he had responded to every call that she gave him throughout his life. You can see in his face when he was taping that he knew he was going to die and the emotion was just pour out of his body. He made you feel that emotion in yourself as you watched the film and all you can do is just hope he makes it out alive.Finally at the end of the movie, after now surviving on his own urination, he see's what I believe is his nephew on the other side of the rock on a couch in the sand. He see's himself playing with him and picking him up playing around and having fun. He realizes there is no chance of getting out of here in any reasonable way, so he kneels down and puts pressure on his arm and snap! He breaks his arm and continues to break it even more. He pulls out his dull knife and begins to cut his arm where he had broken the bone. He is soon stopped by a nerve that seems to painful to cut. This scene itself makes every muscle in your body tense up for 20 seconds and you won't be able to relax. When he finally cuts that cord your entire body twitches in relief. He cuts the rest of his arm off and he escapes from what seemed to be certain death. When he falls backwards and looks at the rock that has trapped and stopped his life for 5 days, you are looking at a man that came back from the dead. When you see this part of the film you watch with 'ahhhh' and you almost don't know how to feel but you almost want to cry because he made it out after everything he went through.This movie is one of the greatest films I have ever seen and I give it a solid 9/10. If you haven't had the pleasure of seeing this movie you need to go out, buy a movie ticket, and see this movie as soon as you can.",9,2,5,22 December 2010
