Marie Antoinette," nice evocation
","A nicely filmed movie. Images act more than words. I especially like the last picture of the film enacting the turmoil of French Revolution. The rhythm is also energetic. And viewing the castle of Versailles is always a pleasure. One person applaud the film once it was shown in my there. A nice entertaining film, even though the Opera Garnier scenery is not historically accurate. But nicely conducted and well thought on the whole. The costumes are also very nice.The rock and roll music fits also, and gives a youth touch that modernizes the plot. Indeed, i was also amazed at the deprivation of Marie-Antoinette in whole her life. It is nicely cast also. Congratulations.",10,31,64,24 May 2006
