Black Swan," Not your typical 'Swan Lake'
","Since I had heard many things about this movie before viewing it, I wasn't sure about how I would react to some aspects of the movie. First of all, I really enjoyed the story, regardless of how disturbing it could be. I relate to it well because I'm in the performing arts myself (music and theatre), and I understand the desire and obsession with being perfect at what you do.Natalie Portman's performance was brilliant--she showed a great example of what some actors, performers, etc. go through--the work that goes into a 'finished product' and how so much of you can be consumed in it. One particular thing I saw improvement in was her facial expressions: in other movies of her that I had seen such as 'Anywhere But Here', I usually found her face to be very dead. I saw a lot more variety in her emotional expression in this role, and it really contributed to her transformation.Although I was saddened by how disturbing and mentally destructive Nina, the ballerina, became, I was not surprised after discovering that Darren Aronofsky had directed the film. He tends to make movies that center around a person being so consumed with their passion or art that it causes great problems or ultimately their own destruction. Another performance that particularly stuck out to me was Barbara Hershey's, who played Nina's mother, Erica. After seeing her during the first part of the movie and then seeing how hers and Nina's relationship is, you are able to tell that mentally, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. However, it's such a brilliant usage of the idea of parents trying to live their once hopes and dreams through their children. She was truly disturbing and smothering--it's very strange and awkward to see her treat her twenty-something daughter like she's eight and have almost complete control over her schedule, eating habits, etc. You almost want to cheer after seeing her assert her independence more, even if she was too drastic about it. Even if a little over the top at times, this film is a shining example of great directing and great performances by Portman and all of the other cast members.",Null,0,1,21 July 2011
The Holiday," Not A Holiday I'd Want To Take
","I usually find romantic comedies to be really clich√©, unfunny, and have horrible acting.With the exception of Kate Winslet, Eli Wallach, and maybe a couple of others, 'The Holiday' is no different. The story follows two women switching homes in different countries for Christmas vacation, and when they leave, their lives are totally changed. Just like that. With no evidence of any real character development or changes (except on Winslet's end). Very realistic, Nancy Meyers.As a person who has been playing the piano for over 10 years, it frustrated me that Jack Black's fingers were on the wrong keys when composing! It's like that epic fail of Freddie Highmore's 'conducting' in 'August Rush'. Have some musical consistency, people!Winslet as the pathetic, emotionally broken, but kind Iris Simpkins was nothing short of dead on. You find her so pathetic and so self-loathing that you do feel immensely sorry for her. Considering this was her first time in a romantic comedy, I applaud her for being able to contribute as much as she did. I found her to be quite charming once she got out of the depression. I found the plot line to be very surface-y, and Meyers could have done so much more with Graham's life circumstances and Amanda's inner pain as well. Instead, it just barely scratches the surface and it leaves you thinking 'why the heck didn't you elaborate on this more?' Cameron Diaz as Amanda....let's just not relive too much of that. It was painfully similar acting to some of her other characters before (more like, in every romantic comedy she's ever been in) which isn't necessarily good acting. She is flat and over the top in the wrong places and there's no build up to those points either! Her chemistry with Jude Law is..eh. Not terrific, but not completely horrible either. They barely pass as a couple, for me. I also don't like that Cameron Diaz got more camera time than Kate Winslet--Kate Winslet is far better, and her character's story was much more interesting.Kate Winslet and Jack Black have absolutely no romantic chemistry whatsoever! They can pass as really great friends, but that's about it. I know that some people found Jack Black dead in his role, but I actually found it refreshing that he was portraying someone a little more down-to-earth. I definitely feel that their story deserved more screen time, especially with the brilliant Eli Wallach's secondary character! So witty, direct, and delightful as Arthur Abbott. There's only so much I can write since the maximum is 1,000 words, but in short, 'The Holiday' is another one of your typical romantic comedies: bad writing and barely there acting.",Null,2,4,22 July 2011
