Hereditary," Solid horror
","So many bad horror films. So few good ones. This is a good one.No cheap scares. More often physical discomfort. Perhaps closer to Japanese/ Korean horror than anything else. Slow paced.However; had the writer/ director not also made 'Midsommar' later on, I probably would not have noticed this. Having seen that film the evening before gave me the patience to sit trough this (not a theatrical viewing!). Having seen both films, my judgement may be clouded. I saw many similarities, that were more effective in the later film.Perhaps closer to an earlier David Cronenberg work than an Early Lars von Trier film, with aspects from neither and yet from both, this is mainly a simple effective horror film. Solid in writing, directing, cinematography, acting, sound, and so on.",8,0,1,24 May 2020
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Ever since I saw the first U.S. dubbed Akira VHS bootleg...
","Somewhere around 1990 I got my first U.S. dubbed bootleg copy of Akira on VHS. Terrible quality (copied from NTSC to Pal) and horrible dub. Must have watched it 20 times and still did not get the story line, not until I finally got the U.K. deluxe box set including the original Japanese version with English subtitles...So why am I bringing up a totally unrelated animated film from about 30 years ago? Firstly and foremost, due to it changing my view of what animation could be... forever! It's doubtful if 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' would have existed without it... or is that going too far perhaps? It changed (for the international market) adult animation in any case. Animation wasn't just for kids any longer.Secondly, for me, it changed how I viewed the Japanese movie market. Despite minor hits, I still thought 'Godzilla' before 'Akira'. And to me Sony is still Japanese, and no they are, as far as productions are concerned, not strictly Japanese. But they do release a lot of (computer) animation such as 'Resident 'Evil.' Besides having a Disney-challenging animation department.So... I like animation... I like adult animation... I like Japanese animation/ anime/ manga... I'm not adverse to super-hero stuff, DC, Marvel, otherwise...So... why am I not loving this? Well, perhaps this got presented as 'something you've never seen before, pure innovation.' It's NOT! This may be technically impressive an innovative. But 'Men in Black 3' was not better than 'The Empire Strikes Back' due to more modern effects.I like this. I gave it a 6 out of 10. The story seems aimed at younger viewers, that fine. This may be the most impressive animated feature this year.I however, am still waiting, after 30 years, to see something animated that has more EMOTIONAL impact on me than Akira did... Sorry...",6,3,8,21 February 2019
Midsommar," Sublime - and correct from a high-priest's view - anthropology
","I was NOT ready for this. Not after months of streaming (expletive deleted - Last-Jedi-like, expletive deleted) quote-content-unquote.My VHS collection numbered over 5.000 titles (long gone), yet I still hang on to all my VCDs. I am not young, neither am I (very) old. Bought my first CED last week, yet my first Laserdisc in the 90's. Saying 'I'm a film fan' is like Rutger Hauer saying 'I've seen things you wouldn't believe' at the end of Blade Runner. Don't get these references, abbreviations and so forth? And as a self-identified millennial you feel no need to Google any of what you don't get? Great! Please leave and do not watch the reviewed film! You will be bored, give it a 1/10, and then go off to make your next TikTok video :-(((Did you go back all the way on the 'HighSeas'-Bay to download Lars von Trier's early-/ student-films? OMG! THIS is for YOU! But even David Cronenberg fans that can stand slow pacing will love this!Now, having only seen the second film from this writer-director this very evening ('Hereditary,' a far more common horror-film, though still exceptional), I do not feel I have the right to comment on his work in a general sense. And I do not feel, having watched the film only once, authorized to comment on this work in any broad sense. I lack degrees in anthropology and psychiatry.I do however have field experience in psychology, a minor degree in (cinema-) photography and I am what Christians call a 'witch'. I am a high-priest of the old religion.The old faith was a nature religion that was widespread in the region now called the West (Northern-Europe to Portugal, Ireland to the Crimea) from ca. 20.000 years ago until the introduction of the Eastern religions (Judaism, Christianity, Mohammedanism/ Islam) into mainland Europe starting ca. 2.000 years ago. It was the main religion (in various forms) among the Celtic people as well as the early Germanic people. It was also the start of all early modern religions. The true story is broader, with the Catholic church branding followers of the old faith as heretics and witches (late mid-eval period). While the religion was polytheistic, a God was depicted alongside the main Goddess. In modern Christian religion the mother Goddess was turned into the minor 'Goddess' Maria. However, in the main religion, the main Goddess was female (moon), while the God (sun) served her to inseminate nature with his fertility.This explanation of the old faith is simplified. As a male I should not be the leader of our circle. I am not good at it, and fear our faith will diminish.The old faith is observed today in various forms by Pagans (a Catholic term, mainly Europa), Druids (mainly U.K.) and Wiccans (mainly U.S.). 'Witch' or 'Hex' is accepted by some as a badge of honor, rejected by some as a derogatory term (similar to the N-word).Now, the reason why I posted this 'review' was mostly in response to another review (giving this movie 2/10). Is essence saying 'In don't get this, I am from Sweden'. My reply is - no, you don't get this, being from Sweden matters not. This could taken place in Poland or Spain. Your country is just known to be one of the last places to have surrendered to the new religions (and yes, we are talking the -mere spec in human history of- 1000 to 500 years). So your country is a logical setting for this film. My country (Holland) was a swamp 1000 years ago, so not a logical setting. Living a modern life, worrying where your next paycheck is coming from, this means nothing to you? If some part of your life however, is in harmony with nature, say 'hey, it's spring, yet where is the rain, my lawn is turning brown' - you will have some understanding.Saying 'A Horror-film with Inga and Helga from Sweden - with lots of nudity' will generate income. And no, if that is what you came for, you may not sleep trough the film... or wake up after, say an hour... Wrong feature!I'm not sure what genre this is, if you like horror, go ahead. If you're attracted by the premises, but don't like this movie? Watch 'Hostel' instead! I love that too, but if you like that, and didn't like this? Please come back and rate this in 2040?But, and 'oh, dear', in the title I promised; 'and correct from a high-priest's view'... Yes. Well, from a Paga-Wicccan point of view (what I usually call myself), it's all complete nonsense. Even the number of spokes in the wheel of the year is off. While the sun-moon thing is referenced, it's very watered down. Like selecting 'pick-n'mix' based on the color brown (may I suggest fresh seasonal forest fruit instead ;-). Jumping off of a cliff however, in a paga-wiccan commune? At that age? Actually living that life? Not my modern western one? Note that the girl at the end (okay - small spoiler) is smiling?The movie tries to warn you: start with some mind-altering mushrooms?",10,1,10,24 May 2020
"Sal√≤, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Pretty weak by todays standars, yet AB FAB!
","First got this due to a rebellious TV-station broadcasting this in the late '80s - early '90s. My VHS copy lasted 2.5 views and then got deleted on purpose. Having it made me feel ill.I later got the U.K. DVD release (pretty much a blank white cardboard case), just to have it. It would not leave my memory. Never watched it again though.After I got married I wanted to watch it with my wife (she's even more insane than I am) and my DVD was in storage. So I downloaded a copy of this movie. Unfortunately it was in the original Italian WITHOUT subtitles. I figured I could do the translation on the go.I could not. Got a few parts here and there, but no whole stories. At this point the movie ended up being just any old boring Italian movie. Not a lot happens. Yes there is the excrement eating scene, something to do with eating nails (I had remembered it as being broken glass which would be much worse), and of course the end bit which is indeed somewhat graphic. But when analyzed frame by frame, it turns out even most of this is suggestion.What is suggested in this film is so horrible, that everyone who watches it remembers seeing it, even though they did not. Only at the end - well, if you watched the whole thing, you get what you wished for I suppose. But most of the story is expressed trough talking.Pasolini... Well, there is a movie on him, so just watch that, instead of me regurgitating. Gay and anarchistic. That's way than better being pro-Mussolini in my book. - Read some Italian history books for that period (communism only other option). (Yeay LGBT!!!). Look, the guy just made this to prove he was more than a (very) soft-core-erotic film maker. I've seen his other films. Lots of naked little boys and half-clad teenage boys.Anyway, this appears to be a severe psychological thriller, as most of the impact comes from actual story telling rather than from action scenes.Pasolini... One sick F#cK. And we love him for it. But believing you've seen stuff while you have not? WOW!!!!! That is film-making!",10,2,6,22 February 2019
