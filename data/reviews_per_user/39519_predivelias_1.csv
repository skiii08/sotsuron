It," Very impressed by all the actors!
","I'm seriously impressed and shocked that those child actors could pull this off so nicely! I think they deserve some credit for that.Also Bill Skarsg√•rd was great in this. The story-line and twist was also fine.It is scary if you have some phobia for clowns but I was more scared of all 'screamer effect' that pops out every few sec but other than that, I would focus more on the fantastic acting from all the actors.",9,1,2,16 November 2017
