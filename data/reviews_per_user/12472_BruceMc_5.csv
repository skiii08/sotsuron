The Blair Witch Project," DON'T BE FOOLED: boring, annoying garbage
","DO NOT BE FOOLED:  'The Blair Witch Project' is incredibly boring, isn't scary, and contains some of the worst acting you've ever seen.  Heather Donahue is the most annoying character to curse the screen since Jodi Thielan in 'Four Friends,' more annoying, even, than Jar-Jar Binks.Everyone knows the story of 'Blair Witch Project' by this time, due to all the hype and incessant promotion, so it's not worth the time to comment on.  What could have been an interesting little horror movie looks, instead, like a C- film student's thesis project.  The 'acting' is loud, the characters are annoying, and the 'cinematography,' if we can call it that, is worthless: since most of the 'scary parts' happen at night, and most of the movie is shot on a hand-held video camera, there is very little that is actually visible.  That would be commendable, if the actors and sound were good enough to carry the story, but they're not.  (See 'Wait Until Dark' if you want a good example of how this SHOULD work.)  Example:  Heather hears an unidentifiable sound and mutters to herself, 'What was that?  What was that sound?  Oh, God, I'm so scared!' Ridiculous.  The filmmakers don't trust the audience to even figure out that they're supposed to be frightened.Additionally, the events that scare the characters aren't scary:  awakening to find a pile of rocks by the tent isn't scary.  Heather:  'Oh, my God!  That pile of rocks wasn't there last night!  Who could have done that?'Also problematic is the fact that nothing happens for the first hour of the movie except the slackers get lost in the woods and whine a lot about how they hate each other.By now you've all heard that the end of the movie is 'truly frightening'; even if you find it frightening, it doesn't make up for the sleep-inducing first hour and 15 minutes.'The Blair Witch Project' may be the stuff of nightmares, but only when you consider that the video will be out soon and that a sequel is in the works.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS INSIPID NONSENSE!",1,2,3,1 October 1999
Cast Away," A boring, stupid movie
","'Cast Away' is not a good movie for numerous reasons, not the least of which is that for an hour of screentime the only conflict is Tom Hanks' toothache. Very simply, nothing happens on the island except some ridiculously silly bits of expository dialogue between Hanks and a volleyball: 'What's that, Wilson?  Why am I sad?  It's because....'  Stupid, awful screenwriting plagues the movie, from bad dialogue to equally ridiculous coincidences-- good thing that FedEx package contains something that Hanks can use as an axe!Hanks is a fine naturalistic actor in the style of Spencer Tracy, and is always fun to watch, but 'Cast Away' is boring:  the only scenes of poignancy and impact are those that aren't set on the island.Wait for the video.  Better still, watch Nicolas Roeg's 'Castaway'-- it's a far superior movie.",3,0,1,15 January 2001
28 Days Later...," How can a zombie movie be so boring?
","With the exception of a couple of sequences, specifically the opening and penultimate, this a surprisingly boring movie.  The violence and suspense we'd expect from an end-of-the-world/zombie move are mostly absent and have been replaced with an uninteristing commentary on family and civilization-- think 'Lord of the Flies' (of which both versions are better than this snoozer).  I suppose the reason for all the mundane scenes of shopping, eating, driving, sleeping, etc., are to make the 'exciting' and 'suspenseful' scenes more 'exciting' and 'suspenseful,' but instead this is just a stunningly boring movie.",3,1,3,12 July 2003
The Insider," Extraordinary movie, but not without problems
","'The Insider' is the latest from 'Vegas' and 'Miami Vice'creator Michael Mann.  Mann's also known for his 'Thief,''Manhunter,' 'The Last of the Mohicans,' 'The Keep,' and'Heat.'  He also won an Emmy for 'The Jericho Mile.'  Mann has a terrific eye and style that is strongly reminiscentof William Friedkin back when Friedkin was good, say, 'Sorcerer' and 'The Brink's Job.'  That is to say, he uses an extremely stylish mix of documentary techniques (hand-held cameras, quick cuts, occasional long stretchesof dialogue) and the more 'cinematic' (fades, dream sequences, unnatural lighting).  The visual sense of 'theInsider' is impeccable, thanks to the cinematography ofDante Spinotti.  Thematically, Mann's films usually involve an accomplished loner's attempts to maintain hislevel of self-respect and professional expertise when theworld around him is changing. Here, the story is interesting, albeit at about 2hrs and45 minutes it's way too long.  And structurally the filmhas one big problem:  the first two thirds of the moviechronicle the conflicts-- he worries about his children,his wife leaves him, he receives death threats, there areimplications that he considers suicide-- of tobacco scientist Dr. Jeff Rigand (played by Russell Crowe) goingpublic with his inside information by granting an interview to '60 Minutes.'  This portion of the film islyrical and beautiful-- Edward Hopper-like realism slowlydissolves into memory and fantasy-- as it shows the interior state of conflict.  However, once the decision ismade not to show the interview at 60 Minutes, the moviebecomes a parallel story of one producer's (Al Pacino)fight to maintain journalistic integrity in a corporateworld.  Although both stories are intriguing, after thevery slow, methodical, suspenseful build-up of the firstsection of the film, the second seems rushed and not asimportant-- there's a sort of a 'been there, done that'feel to that part of the film.  And it doesn't help thatthe film clearly considers the real hero to be Al Pacino--the final (slow-motion) shot is of him resigning his position, bravely going out into the cold, mean streets,turning up his collar, all to a lot of really loud music that doesn't match the rest of the film (thinkof the music you hear every time Bob Hoskins shows up in'The Long Good Friday').  The sequence that opens the film, with a hooded Pacino negotiating an interview withIslamic fundamentalists, and then acting as an intermediary for 60 Minutes during the bickering that precedes the filming of that interview, doesn't really addmuch to the overall flow, either.  That is, the correlation is obvious, equating the terrorists with thetobacco industry, and showing that it takes an intrepid,ethical force to be heard by both sides, but the movie isasking too much of the viewer to equate one man's personal (ethical and professional) conflicts with another man's professional conflicts.This is a terrific, complex, intelligent film, filled with great performances (Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallaceand Russell Crowe as Dr. Rigand are sure to get Oscar nominations), brilliant direction and camerawork, thatworks on all levels.",Null,0,0,7 November 1999
Grindhouse," Leave after the intermission
","Robert Rodriguez' 'Planet Terror,' the first half of the double-bill, is terrific: very campy, very funny, takes all the good parts of the old exploitation movies and uses them to its advantage. Lots of gore, gratuitous nudity, none of the actors seems to take it seriously and that makes it that much more enjoyable.The previews are well-done, especially Rob Zombie's 'Werewolf Girls of the SS' and Rodriguez' 'Machete.' Eli Roth's 'Thanksgiving' was a hoot.Quentin Tarantino's 'Death Proof,' though, is awful: boring, extremely dialogue-heavy: it takes all the bad parts of the old exploitation movies and doesn't improve on them. I'm not a fan of QT's movies, have always thought he's just seen a lot of obscure stuff and steals the best parts, but 'Death Proof' is almost unwatchable. Kurt Russell is appropriately creepy but his 'Stuntman Mike' isn't the star, nor is his souped-up car; instead, the stars are the uninteresting women who are Mike's victims. Really, really awful. As good as 'Planet Terror' is, 'Death Proof' just sucked all the enjoyment I'd had previously during the movie.",1,7,15,16 April 2007
