The Blair Witch Project," This is one of the best movies of the year
","Ok, so it wasn't as scary as everyone said it was.  But what WAS scary about this film was the way that each of the characters gradually (and with much realism) got more frightened, and started to lose it (also the ending was scary-wow!).  That was the scary aspect that the film was trying to show. But as I've realized, people either like this movie or hate it, which my friend did when we saw it.  Plus, many of the people in the theater were also upset after the viewing of the movie.  I'm just glad that other people agree with me that this film was a great one!!! 10/10",10,1,2,12 August 1999
10 Things I Hate About You," Great Movie
","I just saw this movie and I thought that it was hilarious!  It was really funny the way that the guidance counseler, English teacher, and detention teachers were portrayed.  And I also enjoyed seeing the kids in it because it reminded me so much of the kids at my school!  But besides that, the plot was humorous and clever and it even had some jokes involving lines from 'Taming of the Shrew.'  All in all, a great movie.",10,1,2,1 April 1999
American Pie," Great, great movie
","This was a great movie!!! I've never enjoyed a comedy like this in a long time.  Also, I've never been in an audience were  everyone laughed so hard and cheered so loud at many of the film's hilarious moments.  Now THIS is what High School is really like.  Not like Dawson's Creek or Varsity Blues. I could relate to so much in this movie--not that i ever got down with a pie or anything.  The two best characters in my opinion were the band girl (Michele) and Jim's father.  A great movie you should go see right now!!!",10,0,0,25 July 1999
