The Expendables 2," amazing film
","Well, the movie has the required punch which it promises in the previews. It's full of Gun Power, Fire Power and the Muscle Power too. Cleverly planted dialogs also adds to the humor in between the action. However, it lacks the right blend of all the star cast as it was there in the 1st part. Jet Li vanishes after you blink once. It's more of Stallone & Statham. Van Damme has been shown unlike his usual earlier characters - running. His fight with Stallone ended just too soon and keeps your thirst only half quenched. Stunt sequences are repetitive and almost the same as Part 1. i could watch this film over and over again with out getting even a little bit bored",8,1,2,4 October 2012
