Vertigo," Vertigo- true to its title
","Hitchcock is fantastic. Even if one doesn't regularly like old films, I guarantee everyone will love at each one, if not 5 or 10 Hitchcock films. That being said, this movie has a lot to live up to, and it does with flying color. Just when you think you have the movie figured out, there's a new twist. I'll admit it drug out a little in the middle, but it's still a very fast paced movie- you have no idea what's going to happen. A few highlights: the score, opening scene and final shot. Also, Jimmy Stewart isn't your typical Mr. nice guy this time, weather thats a good thing or not is up to you to judge, but the important thing is he does a good job with the role. Vertigo is true to its title and remains one of the all time best movies from one of all time greatest directors.",9,2,3,23 February 2007
The Game," Fincher fan or not- see this movie
","Definitely worth a rent AT LEAST. Fincher's third movie stars Michael Douglas as the rich, cold and alone Nicholas Van Orton. His brother, Sean Penn, gets him a reality-life game from a company who specializes in creating different life games for different people based on their lives, history, likes and dislikes, etc. The object of the game: to figuare out what the object of the game is. Orton is very reluctant about the game, however you can tell he secretly is very intrigued by the idea. As you may guess and without revealing too much- things get out of hand very quickly and things are not what the seem. Michael Douglas is at the top of his game as well (pun intended). Personally, I find this to be one of his best movies he's ever made. All in all, this one is a must for thriller fans, Fincher fans, Douglas fans, and just about everyone else too. 8/10",8,6,9,13 March 2007
Shooter," Shooter: bad poster, crappy title, good movie.
","Shooter: bad poster, crappy title, good movie. When my friends and I heard about this movie we thought it looked like crap, but after seeing the trailer we were convinced this movie actually seemed promising, and indeed it was. Shooter is The Fugitive meets a little bit of Die Hard and Rambo. There's plenty of action for the whole family here. I wasn't much of a Mark Walberg fan until I saw The Departed, and now after I saw Shooter I'm converted, he can really hold his own here. The only downside was Danny Glover's sluring accent. It kinda got annoying, but hes still Danny Glover and so hes still cool. Antoine Fuqua gives us yet another solid a flick, good stuff.",8,1,4,25 March 2007
