Insidious: Chapter 2," Darker and deeper than before
","Having seen the first movie and been scared out of my wits over it, I have come to the conclusion that James Wan is probably one of only a few directors who can actually do what horror movies are meant to do and scare people. Except he doesn't use loads of gore and torture to achieve this aim. Insidious 2 literally begins where Insidious ended. Dalton Lambert is back with his family after coming back from the Further. Unfortunately, he appears to have brought back with him whatever plagued Josh Lambert's childhood i.e. The Old Lady. Insidious 2 deals with her and her attempted slow possession of Josh. The Lambert family move back to Josh's mother's house which is quite old. No sooner do they move and settle in, than strange things happen again. A piano plays randomly late at night, the baby of the family cries for no apparent reason, toys are thrown around rooms and an angry ghost in the form of a violent, white dressed woman starts physically abusing Renai Lambert. Renai is at a loss. She discusses what is going on with Josh's mum and decides to delve deeper. For this, they need help. They turn to the 2 helpers of the previous film who filmed Elise the psychic.Both of these men turn to Elise and appeal to her from the Other Side for help. Elise directs them to Carl, a talented psychic who communicates with the dead via scrabble letters in which the dead spell out what they want to him. The film then takes a dark journey back to Josh's past and to the ghost lady plaguing the family. It turns out the ghost lady was involved with another of Lorraine Lambert's patients and Lorraine, 2 helpers and Carl go through dark, disused hospitals to find out the truth which is more unpleasant than they realise. Added to that, is the knowledge that Josh is slowly being taken over by the Old Lady from the previous film. He changes very slowly but its quite recognisable how much he is being taken over and chilling. Carl realises early on that he has to enter the Further to find the real Josh and try and help him. What follows is pretty much part of the first film shot from a different side. Carl meets Josh who is trapped in the Further while the Old Lady is taking over his physical body. He follows Josh around in the Further and encounters Ellise who helps them. This part of the film is pretty terrifying as we discover the reasons why the door would open for no reason and why creepy characters are wandering around the house. In the normal world, however, Renai is dealing with a husband who seems to be out to kill her. This part of the film is probably the most harrowing, especially for women who've suffered domestic violence. Renai, however, is not a passive victim and fights back quite strongly to the extent of locking herself down in the basement with Dalton whilst Josh does his very best to imitate Jack Nicholson's character from The Shining. However, it is Dalton who saves the day. He calls Josh back from the Further after entering it to find his dad and brings both his father and Carl back. Ellise bids them farewell. All appears to be well in the Lambert's world finally but Ellise's spirit returns to help her 2 former assistants. She goes to the house of a young woman troubled by something and finds something there so horrifying its going to cause even more trouble.Fans of the first movie will note that the Red faced Demon of the first is not in evidence here. If you're expecting him, prepare to be disappointed. It does look as if there will be another movie however, and he's likely to turn up in that. This film is pretty frightening but it is more 'jumpy' shocks than anything else. The trip into the Further that Josh, Dalton and Carl make is chilling and grim stuff. Lorraine and friends trip around the derelict mental hospital where she worked is grim enough and ghosts abound everywhere. This is not a film to watch alone or if you're easily afraid.",8,0,2,1 December 2013
The Avengers," Mad and crazy stuff super hero stuff
","Having enjoyed Thor and also the Iron Man films, I felt this combination should be mind blowing. I wasn't disappointed.First of all, if you haven't seen Thor, then don't watch this film. You won't follow the set up. Its this which holds the film together and explains much. The film starts with SHIELD'S discovery of something called the Tesseract. The Tesseract contains some kind of intense energy and SHIELD employs Dr Eric Selvig to try and understand its energy. Hot on the heels of Selvig's investigations is Loki of Asgard, a super villain and brother of Thor with breathtaking ambition. Loki comes in, uses the Tesseract to enslave both Selvig and Hawkeye and gets both on his side. Cue Nick Fury who has to get together the other members of the Avengers group. These include Natasha Romanov, Dr Bruce Banner, Captain America Steve Rogers and Iron Man Tony Stark. It also includes Thor who comes along in hot pursuit of Loki to try and bring him back to Asgard and face justice.Cue lots of thrilling set pieces. There is Stark's extraordinary tower, based on his clean energy ideas, Thor and Loki's humorous verbal sparring parodied by Tony Stark and Tony Stark and Steve Rogers' verbal sparring. All play nicely off against each other. There is Natasha's moment with Loki, the team coming together on board SHIELD's ship and finally the incredible attack by the Chitari on New York, led by Loki. As is usual with these dazzling things, much of the plot flies out of the window amidst the extraordinary visuals. Tom Hiddleston's Loki has a nicely subtle play out and seems to be more than comfortable in his role. Chris Hemsworth wears his Thor well. Robert Downey Jnr is as wonderfully wisecracking as ever, Chris Evans gives his elder statesman Captain America a well rounded character as totally different from his jack-the-lad role as one of the Fantastic Four, Scartlett Johansson plays Romanov with coolness and Mark Ruffalo adds a sharper performance to Bruce Banner than I've seen in a long time. Jeremy Renner is a bit too quiet for Hawkeye. Combined that with Nick Fury and the other members of SHIELD and you have experience which rises out of what could be a very overwhelming movie experience.",9,2,6,11 December 2014
Iron Man 3," Ironman 3 - as much fun as the other 2
","I've read a couple of the reviews of this film and been disappointed. Whats not to like here? Its Ironman back for another movie and that means a lot more fun.Ironman 3 starts off in the past long before Tony Stark, millionaire weapons maker and playboy ended up with an arc-reactor in his body to deal with his shrapnel problem. It starts in 1999 and the night before 2000 when Stark is attending a conference and has a beautiful, intelligent woman present her idea to him. He also meets and brushes off another man, Aldrich Killian who eventually may prove to have had a good idea.Cut to the present day and Stark is trying to make a go of his company, his relationship to Virginia 'Pepper' Potts and his life generally. His company is doing fine, his relationship and life not so, partly due to his dealing with anxiety attacks after the New York business referenced in the Avengers Assemble. He has also made friends with another armoured character called Iron Patriate or War Machine, played quite nicely by Don Cheadle.All this continues onward as Stark has to deal with The Mandarin. The Mandarin appears to be a shadowy terrorist who strikes on American soil, in particular one attack which destroys the Mann's Chinese Theatre. He takes it upon himself to investigate further and finds that the Mandarin and the forces behind him are not all they seem.Stark goes out on a limb and challenges the Mandarin to bring the fight to him, in an act of rather crazy bravado. The Mandarin reciprocates affording Stark and us the opportunity to see his new designs in action as one of the most complicated action sequences occurs. After seeing his house destroyed, Stark takes himself out to the wilds and finds more about Killian. Killian is not all he seems. The end of the film is a blaze of action set pieces and loose end tie ups, including Stark's operation to rid himself of the shrapnel trying to kill him. Whether Tony Stark returns or not is up to the producers. I disagree with many of the reviewers of this film. Ironman 3 is a load of fun. It has a crazy plot and humour, which is so often missing in super hero type movies particularly in the Batman ones. Downey Jnr is such good fun and all the cast do a brilliant job. Ben Kingsley's Mandarin is an especially nice touch, whilst Guy Pearce continues to show us what a fine actor he is. This only managed an 8 cos I want more films.",8,16,25,1 December 2013
Hostel," Nasty movie
","Regrettably, this is 2 hours of my life I won't get back. Quite why I bothered with this film is beyond belief as I was willing to give it a chance because I wanted to make up my own mind about it and not rely on other critical opinions of the film which are often made by film critics who have not watched the film they're supposed to be reviewing.This film is based solely on one unpleasant premise. Show enough gore, torture and thin women with no clothes on and you will have an audience and thus, an income. There is no other reason for watching this. It certainly doesn't qualify as 'entertainment'.The plot is basic, if at times annoying. Three backpackers fresh out of college and two from America journey to Europe (or rather Eastern Europe) and hope to get very drunk, very stoned and have lots of guilt free sex with young, thin Eastern European women who seem to think all American men are great in bed (I'm serious). After a series of sexual, drug and clubbing adventures they venture into former Soviet union territory (something unthinkable in the eighties) and are lured into an underground movement of Europeans who provide foreigners (all kinds) for rich people (mostly men) to torture, mutilate and possibly kill in the most messy way possible. Said men pay a lot of money for this 'privilege'. What ensues is a lot of nightmarish rubbish involving all the usual equipment of torture: chainsaws (how obvious), cutting Achilles' tendons with scalpels, guns and various other torture gear. That's it.Don't say you haven't been warned.",1,0,2,28 February 2007
Brokeback Mountain," Ang Lee's story of cowboy forbidden love
","I had high hopes for this, based on Ang Lee's other film Crouching Tiger which was beautifully shot and acted but, although very beautiful to look at, it was a film that didn't seem to go anywhere. A lot of this was the thin premise of the story. Two cowboys thrown together in lonely circumstances begin a sort of sexual relationship but, because of their lives and situation at the time (the sixties) have to continue their love secretly. For me it was a very disappointing film, although very well acted by all the actors, I genuinely felt it wasn't going anywhere and after half an hour, felt it could have been a shorter movie.I'm not even sure it did that much for the gay rights movement in America, either. After all, neither actor was overtly gay either in their scenes together or in real life. Heath Ledger was the strong, very silent type and Jack Gyllenhaal, an actor who was more at home playing this sort of role, was quite likable.",7,2,18,29 May 2006
Cloverfield," nice premise for a horror movie spoiled by home video style
","What an incredibly original idea for a film! Make a horror/disaster movie in the style of a home video, complete with rotten, shaky camera work and the camera operator speaking as he is recording the 'video'.Unfortunately, this has been done before and no better. The Blair Witch Project got there first and, although, this film uses CGI effects to enhance the disaster movie experience, the premise is the same; horror movie in a home video style.I have to say, I was watching this on a DVD, not the cinema. I probably couldn't have coped with it on the cinema with its big screen, which would have made the home video feel absolutely horrific. I can imagine leaving the cinema to be ill or suffering from motion sickness. As it was, every time the camera/operator did one of his 'spins' to push the camera around to talk to someone else, I had to look away. This is not really something you want to do in a film like this.I have to say, but Sam Raimi did this so much better in Evil Dead. However, he didn't use a video camera and his shots were far better done. The acting was basic at best, but then you weren't watching this for the acting nor the dialogue. The disaster aspect was nicely done, but only if you could tolerate the camera work long enough to appreciate it.This film also took a long time to really get started. There was a lot of completely pointless 'background' setup which could have been cut so easily and the plot brought more swiftly to conclusion.My advice to the filmmakers for a sequel is: ditch the home video feel and shoot it properly without home video, but maybe use the home video sparsely, and you'll make a better film.",5,1,3,20 April 2008
Burn After Reading," Coen bros multi-star vehicle hit
","At first I thought this was another George Clooney/Brad Pitt 'Oceans' style collaboration. Interesting but ultimately daft. I was right. It is also more than that.This is one of those films where it would be nice not to worry too much about the plot. However, the plot is so convoluted and daft that it is almost too much to ignore it. Here goes: Frances McDormand's character Linda wants a lot of surgery and can't get it through her medical insurance. She has convinced herself that, without it, life is boring.Until she gets the surgery, she will carry on dating a variety of rather pointless men. Enter Oz Cox. Oz Cox is a frustrated CIA/G man who is about to lose his job. His bosses claim he has a drink problem and his only defence is to blame his Mormon colleague (who is sober). He eventually quits his job and decides to write his rather dull memoirs. Now here is where it gets complex. Oz Cox's wife played by Tilda Swinton is having an affair with George Clooney's character Harry Pfarrar. Harry Pfarrar is serial dating a couple of women besides being married. One day, Oz Cox's legal secretary leaves a CD of his memoirs in the gym where Frances McDormand's character works along with her somewhat dim colleague played by Brad Pitt. It is Pitt who discovers the CD and realises or rather thinks, it might be valuable. Linda (Frances McDormand) decides to get onboard, turning into the brains of the operation. The pair of them decide to blackmail Oz Cox for a lot of money, enough to pay for Linda's surgery etc. Unfortunately, the pair bank on the disk's importance. The CD, it turns out, contains nothing particularly interesting to the Russians, who they take it to. The Russians inform the CIA/FBI etc (Oz's bosses). They appear to be confused over the whole mess. With me so far!So Linda decides to internet date Harry (George) who is involved with Oz's wife. In the meantime, Tilda Swinton playing Oz's wife decides to leave Oz and locks him out of their house. For some peculiar reason, Brad Pitt's character has to pay a visit to the house but only runs into Harry and ends up accidentally shot. There are a lot of sub-plots in this movie. There is Harry Pfarrar who seems to be a sub-plot all by himself, played admirably by George Clooney who is a study in rather nicely dressed paranoia. On top of that, is the thing he is designing, which is a kind of 'love chair' which he shows to Frances McDormand's character. The Coen bros have a couple of lovely moments in the film where George thinks he is being followed by the Government which is a very nice nod/salute to George Clooney's politically motivated films and interests. Brad Pitt also acquits himself well as the nutty gym instructor with strange hair. But for my money, it is John Malkovitch as Oz Cox who really shines or rather tries to, with a character who should have been better written. Some of Malkovitch's lines are horrible, acres of the f-word. This is disappointing. Malkovitch is a truly brilliant actor, completely in his own league and very intelligent. Why couldn't the Coens give him better material to say? The same with Tilda Swinton. Again, brilliant, intelligent actress who has nothing good to say at all, her character being reduced to that of a red-haired sarcastic harridan. Again, please do better next time.",8,1,5,18 November 2008
Watchmen," Far more adult fare than the traditional 'superhero' stuff
","Over the last few months there has been enormous hype about the film adaption of Alan Moore's graphic novel 'Watchmen'. Like V for Vendetta, I have never read Watchmen but I was curious about it, having enjoyed the satire of V for Vendetta. It is a pity that Moore refuses to claim credits for either film adaptation as neither are particularly bad films.Unlike a lot of superhero type movies, Watchmen has an intelligent subtext and alternative reality. Set in the 1980s in America, Nixon is still President and it is long before Reagan gets a look-in. America is on the brink of nuclear war with Russia as the cold war bites and there is great unease and lawlessness within American society. Out of this, comes the character Rorschah, with a voice like gravel, charting the death of superhero 'the comedian', a character of incredible sadism, despatched by an unknown assassin. Rorschah's investigations, like some masked Phil Marlowe, lead him to dig out the past of fellow superheros 'Nite Owl II', Silk Spectre II, Ozymandias and Dr Manhattan. Of the group, only the latter, Dr Manhattan, is in possession of incredible superpowers, having suffered a scientific experiment which went (in usual superhero style) horribly wrong. Now John Osterman is pretty much indestructible and capable of superman type behaviour, also glowing a rather cold shade of blue and possessing a voice like HAL from 2001. It is clear in the film that both Rorschah and Manhattan are cut of the same cloth, both struggling with society and its problems and their own grievances with it. Yet whereas Rorschah chooses to try and ignore society, Manhattan struggles to fit in.Unlike a lot of superhero movies, there is little less action in this. There is a whole lot of plot and back story, particularly about Manhattan and how he came to be as he is and Silk Spectre II or Laurie Jupiter and her difficult relationship with her mother. Laurie is also struggling with John/Manhattan's moods as well and trying to be his lover, although he doesn't make it much of a priority. Again, unlike so many superhero movies which deal in a more childish world, Watchmen is unafraid of sex and depicting some sex and male/female nudity, a rare departure from films of this genre. Dan (Nite Owl II) and Laurie are seen enjoying each other after the rescue of some families from a burning building and Laurie is also seen earlier being 'pleasured' by Manhattan. The film also contains the most inventive use of Leonard Cohen's song 'Hallelujah' when it is being played as Dan and Laurie are having sex in Dan's superhero vehicle.Where this film really stands out is that there is no clear supervillian, as in real life. There are just lots of questions. My only grumble of this film is that there is little opportunity for Ozymandias' character to fully come out. He is portrayed as two dimensional and quite cold. There is much to recommend this film. It has a fearless portrayal of alternative sexual relationships, such as lesbianism and it doesn't shy away from nudity, particularly male nudity.",7,0,1,8 September 2009
American Beauty," Not so much 'look closer' as 'American Reflections'.
","I heard about American Beauty after the Oscars fuss in which it did tremendously well and I wondered, 'What is it about this movie?'. Its director was British but it is rooted particularly in the American Consciousness of the now, this century. Kevin Spacey is sublime as Lester Burnham, the beleaguered, comatose American husband on the verge of a midlife crisis. His marriage is a mess, his wife is preoccupied with her career and 'stuff', his daughter is enduring typical teenage angst and insecurity and he is wondering why he is sleepwalking through life. Tired of doing this, Lester decides to blackmail his boss and quits his job with a massive payoff, fantasies about his daughter's blonde best friend, works out, smokes the dope bought from his new neighbour's overly sensitive son who films people dong strange stuff and gets a new job in a Burger bar to be deliberately difficult. All of this exasperates his wife, who after watching him 'masturbate' and getting a lecture on 'why' decides to learn to screw her rival and shoot guns. Meanwhile his daughter is now involved with his new neighbour's son who is having lots of problems with his controlling All American US Marine Corp father.You just know this mixture is like gunpowder. At some point, someone will light the touchpaper or the fuse and walk quickly away.Brilliant performances from all, including Thora Birch and Wes Bentley who act beyond their years and career bests from Annette Benning and Kevin Spacey makes this a thought-provoking movie.",8,0,1,20 May 2006
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Dark as night Fincher remake of Swedish thriller
","I made the decision to come to the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo - the film right after finishing the book and I'm glad I did, partly because in order to understand the way the film moves around, you really need to have read the book. Firstly, there are the main characters. Daniel Craig is brilliant as Mikael Blomkvist, the disgraced financial journalist whose libellous actions find him out of popular favour and put him right in the arms (and money) of the Vanger family and Corporation. Here, he is tempted to indulge Henrik Vanger's obsession with finding out where lost family member Harriet is. His chief motivations are pressed flowers which come each year from who knows where or who and a sense of closure he desperately craves as an old man. In short Craig's journo has to turn detective to satisfy the old man's curiosity. As Blomkvist leaves his magazine behind in the capable hands of his married lover Erika, he travels to the colder north of Sweden to the heart of the Vanger family in Hedestad. He deals with cold weather, a family of dysfunctional people, some with 'nazi' tendencies and, in the latter stages someone trying to kill him. No mean task this.Playing parallel to Blomkvist's adventures is the story of Lisbeth Salander. Salander, played very ably by Rooney Mara, is a punk, goth, rather brilliant loner with her own values/opinions on sexuality. We first meet Salander as she emerges from her motorbike, wearing a distressed black leather jacket, spiky black hair, extreme make-up and facial piercings which scream 'leave me alone'. Salander is a woman who dresses her own way with little thought as to her perceived attractiveness and desperately wants Swedish society to leave her well alone to do her job and not be hassled by anyone. Of course, this is not the case. After one social welfare guardian suffers a stroke, Salander is taken into the 'care' of another who just sees a way to exploit and control the free spirit, abusing his power by coercing Salander in a series of horrifying sexual assaults, each more severe than the last. This makes for very hard watching, as Salander is bound to his bed and is raped, all because he believes she should be more 'sociable' and friendly. His comeuppance is just as brutal, but also deserved as Salander zaps him with a tazer then dishes out some of her own treatment. Thus do the paths then cross. Blomkvist appeals to Frode, his employer's solicitor for help in researching details and Frode points him to Salander. In the most uncomfortable of meetings, Salander begins to help Blomkvist in his journey to find Harriet alive or dead. It is this journey that continues to take darker paths, as Blomkvist reveals whats at the heart of the Vanger family and it really isn't pretty. Salander also initiates a sexual relationship with Blomkvist and in the course of the film, finds solace and a sort of brief peace in his care. In return for that, she manages to save his life after he is assaulted at the hands of another Vanger family member. Fincher makes this adaptation of the film something to look at and a challenge to follow. For women there is a strong female lead to watch in Salander, a woman who tries to live her life by her own rules (but doesn't always succeed) and Blomkvist whose own love life is a bit of a mess in the book has it rationalised slightly in the film by only managing 2 lovers. And there's the brilliant mostly British cast, who include Craig, Geraldine James, Christopher Plummer, Stephen Berkoff and Joely Richardson with grand turns from Robin Wright and Stellan Skaarsguard (who else),but its Craig and Rooney Mara who make this film with likable, believable characters, not merely parts which could have ended up as caricatures.",8,3,9,4 January 2012
Insidious," First film ever I've seen to deal with astral projection
","I had wanted to see this for a while, based on the trailer, which looked pretty scary and I wasn't disappointed, having bought it on Blu-ray DVD. It certainly lives up to its name. The idea of an insidious threat is one that grows, as the growing sense of unease with which this film plays out, highlights. Even the opening credits are very unsettling.Patrick Wilson's character and his lovely, very hard working wife and 2 young children move into a new home and almost from the word go, strange things start happening. House alarms go off, one of their children meets with a nasty accident and ends up in hospital and intruders seemingly come into the house. Neither Patrick nor his wife Rose want to admit whats going on. Its only until they call in a psychic (with much persuasion on Rose's part) that it becomes apparent that there's 'something' badly wrong with both their son and the house. The use of astral projection as an explanation is a brilliant one and adds a real flavour and purpose to the film, but its the sense of real, genuine menace that sets this scary movie from almost all others. There's a touch of the Excorcist going, Poltergeist, the Others (quite a big nod to that) and Paranormal Activity. No gore, but then it doesn't need it . A brilliant movie which does what it says on the tin.",Null,0,1,25 October 2011
Ex Machina," God in the machine indeed!
","Eagerly awaited for this to come out on blu ray as I'd missed its cinema run. Glad I waited as this is a thoughtful film which requires a quiet cinema in order to avoid missing crucial plot details.Domhnall Gleeson plays Caleb, a nervous yet highly intelligent 26 year old coder within the Blue Book company who 'wins' a week long trip to his boss's home set in a remote, mountainous area. Having no commitments of any kind, Caleb packs his bag and flies out to the location which spans many hundreds of miles of incredibly beautiful scenery. There, he checks into boss Nathan's ultra modern bunker type residence and is issued with a card which limits him to certain areas in the house. This card is a crucial detail in the film.Nathan turns out to be a seemingly easy going contradiction in terms guy. One minute he is working out and keeping fit, the next, he is drinking quite a lot of beer, wine and vodka. He is also a loner, like Caleb. Both men are not in relationships with women or men and seem to not have significant family ties with anyone. Nathan shows Caleb to his room and points out the need for his brand of security. A non- disclosure agreement is signed and the 2 can now get down to business. In Nathan's case, business involves a project of enormous secrecy and intrigue. In Caleb's case, it is getting over the initial shock of being considered a 'lab rat'.Caleb is introduced to Nathan's work in the form of a highly sophisticated robot called Ava. Ava is beautiful in a child like way, having an eternally youthful face and the profile of a young woman, complete with breasts and buttocks albeit covered in a grey mesh. Caleb finds Ava fascinating and compliments his work, comparing him to a god. One evening, whilst seemingly observing Ava through screens in his room, the whole room is plunged into a red light and the bunker is put into a lock-down whilst the system repairs itself. Caleb becomes understandably worried but is told by Nathan that power blackouts are quite common. Caleb gets more time to interact with Ava. She asks him questions and also dresses up for him, putting on a pretty dress and a top along with a wig to make herself seem more 'girlish and less robot'. It works, until the red light comes on and Ava tells Caleb not to trust Nathan and points out that when the red light comes on and the blackout occurs, Nathan can't see them on the bunker's cameras . So Caleb is drawn into an intrigue with Ava. He also spends his evenings watching Nathan getting drunk and insulting the Asian servant who apparently speaks no English and doesn't say anything anyway. Ava makes clear that Caleb is being manipulated on both sides as he is. At one point, Caleb gets Nathan so drunk, he manages to steal Nathan's entry card. The revelations are terrifying. Nathan has not only created Ava but a score of robot prototypes, designing them all as women which he then imprisons as he figures out each time where he's been going wrong. The end results all end up in Nathan's closet, like Ironman suits or bat suits in these particular films. Caleb also discovers that Nathan's non speaking Asian servant is also a robot, albeit one designed to offer silence and obedience to Nathan's emotional/physical needs. This leads to Caleb questioning whether he, too, is a robot as he cuts his arm deeply in one moment to try and reveal any hidden circuitry.In another moment, Caleb tells Ava that he will programme the doors to release during a power cut situation but only when he has gotten Nathan blind drunk. Nathan refuses to get blind drunk and tells Caleb that Ava has, too, been manipulating him for her own ends. Caleb states Ava has passed the Turing test. In the end, Caleb is left to watch as Ava and the Asian assistant both conspire to get rid of Nathan and gain freedom. Nathan's Asian assistant 'dies' in the attempt but Ava manages to re-cloth herself and leaves the bunker and Caleb to make her way in the world.This film is very clever. It uses the veneer of sci-fi to ask some difficult and unanswered questions about this generation of men and their relationship with women. Caleb and Nathan are two men who seemingly have no meaningful relationships with women (or anyone else). Their intelligence has somehow made them both separate from the common ebb and flow of masculinity. Both are looking for the first steps of replacing human beings (for that, read women) with compliant, obedient A.I. Unfortunately, Alex Garland has turned it on its head and the robot outsmarts both the master and his servants. The message is clear: Only by sorting out their relationship with women will men be liberated.",8,0,3,1 June 2015
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Surprisingly funny addition to this trilogy
","Never has a sequel to The Force Awakens been more eagerly anticipated as this one, if only for the answers to some questions. Last Jedi opens with the familiar 'what has happened so far' and straight into a space battle: this time, between the growing totalitarian First Order, who are trying to re-establish the Empire in the galaxy once again, and the Rebellion who are trying their damn best to stop it happening. Loads of action in the first 20 minutes with General Leia pitting her wits against the orders of Supreme Leader Snoke. Some humour too as Oscar Isaac's ace pilot teases General Hux. Very little seems to have moved on in this saga. Rey has gone in search of Luke Skywalker, now playing Jedi hermit to try and persuade him to come back and help the Rebellion, which he refuses to do. She also wants him to give her some answers (the usual ones - who are her parents and why is she strong with the Force and what should she do about it) and maybe train her in the ways of the Force. Although Skywalker does reluctantly show Rey something of the Force, he doesn't decide to train her, despite her being v strong with it.In the background, Finn finally wakes up from his coma. He also realises that the Rebellion are in more trouble than ever and tries to get away from that and find Rey to warn her, but instead gets roped into some crazy scheme to get onboard a First Order cruiser and disable something to help the Rebellion escape. It is at this point that the story does the same as Empire did and splits off into different sections. We have Rey and Skywalker, General Leia and Poe and Finn and friend on a mission. In the midst of all of this, is Rey's link with Kylo Ren which is exploited or created by Snoke and Ren's overwhelming desire for revenge. There are one or two familiar moments. Ren's wearing of a helmet and his occasional bouts of temper, Finn's ability to throw a spanner in the works in almost every moment and Rey, who seems to be getting more comfortable with her abilities as she goes on, bar a few odd moments. The big stand-out in this movie is Mark Hamill, reprising his role as Luke Skywalker, hero of the Rebellion and wannabe Jedi Master who has gone into exile on a remote island being looked after by strange 'keepers' and admitting defeat after trying to train Ben Solo/Kylo Ren to become a Jedi. Fearful of having created a monster, he has become disillusioned and refuses to either get involved with the Rebellion anymore or train Rey. It is also about General Leia who maintains a quiet dignity throughout the film as the movie leaves more questions than answers. I enjoyed it. There is more than enough action and flashes and bangs going on to satisfy the most ardent fan and more than enough faux mysticism for the Jedi wannabes out there.",8,1,3,26 December 2017
Paranormal Activity," Blair Witch style video drama with scary moments
","I decided to watch this on Blu-Ray, having heard and read about it on the internet. This has been billed as one of those rarities: a genuinely frightening film with lots of shock moments. To some extent, it doesn't disappoint.This film is in a similar vein to the Blair Witch Project and utilises sophisticated 'home video-ing' involving the protagonists of the movie - a young couple living together in a comfortable family home, enjoying a relatively normal lifestyle. It is the man of the movie - Micah who does the filming and his girlfriend, Katie who provides the film with some of its more scary moments, with her erratic behaviour.The film starts off innocently enough with the couple using the video-camera and scene setting. It transpires that the couple have been having haunting/ghost problems with their house, most of the haunting centred on Katie. Apparently, she believes that a demon is operating in the house and it has been focussing its attentions on her.The filming builds up gradually. The couple include both daytime filming and filming done while they 'sleep' in the bedroom. It is the bedroom filming which provides the most worrying moments. Minor moments include the bedroom door being opened slightly then one night it is banged shut. Other things include lights being switched on, a picture being smashed, heavy breathing on Katie, powder put down and 'footprints' appearing in it, a picture from Katie's troubled past cropping up in the attic and even an ouiji board being used and burned.Both actors do a marvellous job, convincing us completely that there is something going on in the house and in the process involve us in their problem. There are no dramatic solutions, as in films like the Exorcist where priests come in and attempt to solve the problem. Both people approached seem powerless to do anything.The film ends as we expect. With a dramatic moment followed by an address to the camera.",7,0,1,17 July 2010
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Potter really does grow up!
","I had the usual expectations and excitement of a new Harry Potter movie, although I knew that a lot of the moments from the book are usually done away with. This film is spot on and much darker than all of the other films. There is less emphasis on out and out action and more story-telling moments, such as Luna and Harry's meeting with the Thestrals in which Luna explains why Harry and she can see them. Evanna is absolutely spot on in the film and embodies the idea of the character being slightly unusual but friendly and genuine nevertheless. For me, she was not in the film long enough and you wanted to get more about the character simply from meeting her.Other regulars are equally as good. Emma Thompson was wonderful as the unhappy Trelawney who gets bullied by Imelda Staunton's ruthless dictator and bully Umbridge. Rickman does wonderfully as Snape, revealing why he hates Harry so much (because Harry's father bullied him at school) and is particularly delightful in the subtly done Occlumency scenes which I thought wouldn't have got into the film (although there is less airtime given to them). Other scenes that work particularly well and add layer include Harry's detentions and the reveals to Umbridge's boo-hiss sneering and chuckling. In fact, Staunton is brilliant. You just want to hate her character so much, which is precisely the point.Other parts continue to shine as well. Michael Gambon starts to show an accustomed vulnerability and agedness to Dumbledore which lines him up for the character's later films. He has a much more detached relationship with Harry in this film as per the book.And where would Harry Potter be without Hermione and Ron? Well, both do excellently, trying to show the differences between the three and the similarities. All three work very well together and continue to show both gravity and layers beyond their childhood years to their acting. Also, Neville Longbottom is given more to do beyond the usual fooling about of previous films. We get to discover why his parents aren't around anymore and his animosity towards one of Sirius Black's family, the utterly mad and bad Bellatrix LeStrange, played wonderfully by Helena Bonham Carter (although I can't help wondering what Helen McCrory would have been like in the role).All in all, superb film and lots to watch and be amazed by the wonderful set designs and details. Certainly bears a second viewing to take in the bits you missed.",8,1,2,12 July 2007
The Departed," Martin Scorsese's film which won awards but divided critics
","I came to this film, pleased that Martin had won awards at the recent Academy Awards night. For him, this was confirmation of what most of us already knew: that he is a brilliant and innovative director and should have got his awards years ago.I have seen a number of Scorsese films, namely Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, Gangs of New York, and now this. For me, this is not one of his best. It is a long, drawn out familiar territory type of film which takes a brilliant plot, that of divided loyalties in a police department and runs with it. DiCaprio, Damon, Wahlberg, Sheen and Farmiga are all brilliant whereas Nicholson plays himself with a performance similar to that in the Witches of Eastwick, ie unpleasant, full of expletives, especially towards women and his relationship with them and something akin to how you imagine the devil to be. For me, he was far too way over the top and a little more restraint from Scorsese could have reigned Nicholson in to give another brilliant performance. What lets this film down is not the story or plot or players. It is the script. As seems to be the trend nowadays, there is a lot of swearing and sexual swearing in this film. Two films seemed to do this excessively, one being Inside Man and this one. I am aware that a streetwise police officer and cop in America and gangland hoodlums will indulge in a lot of swearing and general profanity but why can't films have something better to say? This film could have gotten away with far less profanity and a lot less of the references to female bodily parts and female specific bodily functions than it did. It would not have made the film any less watchable. For me, it speaks of lazy writing and implies that the women in this film are second class citizens and they are not. Even although there is a very good role for a woman in this film, the implication is that women are second fiddle. This seems to play out a lot in Scorsese's films. My advice to Scorsese is: employ a brilliant female actress of which there are numerous and give her something really good to say and do and don't make her a prostitute. Finally, there is an outstanding performance from DiCaprio in this film. Talk about maturity! DiCaprio has well and truly buried his pretty boy image in this film by far. He delivers the tense, lonely performance of a man who doesn't really know who his friends are and anyone he can trust. Damon, too is excellent. As the duplicitious Sullivan, he delivers a performance not unlike that of another character - that of Mr Riley. One minute, you like Sullivan, the next, you realise you've backed the wrong horse.One key thing about this film is the little details. This is a film you have to concentrate with, otherwise things are missed.",7,0,1,5 March 2007
The Witch," Superstition and abandonment mar family's lives
","Saw The Witch on Blu Ray rather than cinema as felt that the cinema's public setting would ruin a film which relied heavily on the right atmosphere in order to effectively tell the story. I was right. For this film, you need silence. It is silence which lends this film its menace, rather than showy special effects. The Witch is set in the New World of the Puritan fathers. The main family of this film are mother and father, eldest daughter, younger brother, twins and a baby, newly born. Having been cast out of their puritan community for going against the community's teachings, in some way, the father takes his family to leave on the edge of a dark wood. He builds enclosures for goats and sets about growing corn to feed his family. His family pray regularly and look to God for forgiveness of their sins regularly. They are in all senses of the phrase, God Fearing people. Within this close and claustrophobic environment, tensions start to mount. The youngest member of the family disappears and is thought to be stolen by a creature in the woods who is seen as using the child for its nefarious ends. The baby is not seen again and with no idea of what happened to him. All this leads to the mother of the family (Katie Dickie, fresh from Game of Thrones) crying and accusing family members, mostly the eldest girl (Thomasina - played by Anya Taylor-Joy) of theft of a silver cup. Then there is the eldest boy, Caleb and his father going hunting in the woods looking for venison. They find a hare which is not killed and lose their dog in the process. More lies to the mother about the nature of their trip. Thomasina is ordered to clean her brother's clothes at the river on the edge of the wood. She does this and notices her younger brother taking a interest in her body. The twins join them and start joking about there being a witch in the woods. Thomsina holds the little girl down stating that she is the witch and she has made a pact with the devil etc. More upset and shouting. Naturally, things go from bad to worse. Caleb goes into the forest with his sister to find the family dog and she loses the only horse they have and Caleb finds the family dog dead with its entrails hanging out. He also discovers the woodland house of the 'witch', a seemingly young, beautiful woman who kisses him and 'bewitches' him. Thomasina discovers him after a terrible night and he is naked and feverish. He babbles deliriously, then dies. In that moment, Thomasina is accused of being a witch by the twins, however, she also tells them that the family's black billy-goat - called Black Philip has been talking to the twins. Their father locks all of them in the goat shed whilst he buries his son and considers going back to the plantation /community for help. It is at this point, after much slow burn and build up that the film gains a greater pace. The mother 'sees' her precious dead children returned to her and 'breastfeeds' her lost baby. Unbeknown to her, a raven pecks at her breast, leaving it bloodied. The father then wakes up and goes to see how the children in the goat shed are. He finds the goat shed destroyed and the black goat running wild. The black goat then goads him repeatedly and painfully and he dies. Then the mother accuses Thomasina of sin and tries to kill her. Thomasina then kills her mother by stabbing. There is nothing left in the farm for Thomasina. Her father is dead, her mother dead, her brother has died of fever (presumably) and its not known what has happened to the twins. It is at this point, that it is likely that Thomasina will die too of hunger, exposure or madness. Thomasina withdraws to the goat shed following Black Philip. She asks Black Philip to speak to her as he did to the twins. Almost at the point of giving up, Black Philip answers and tells her how to get the things she wants - in this case the taste of butter (being properly fed) and a pretty dress (being a Puritan, wearing pretty dresses was considered vain and sinful). Black Philip tells her to remove her clothing (a bit of a cliché) and sign the book offered (presumably, offering her soul to the devil in exchange for a better life - again a cliché). He also helps her to sign it. This is at the point where the film enters superstitious nonsense territory. I shall not disclose any more of that as it belongs to the realms of nonsense in the vein of Denis Wheatley Hammer House of Horror film. It is the only part of the film which let it down, unfortunately.If you watch this film as an attempt to portray witchcraft in a realistic light, I wouldn't bother. You ain't going to find that here. As a fictional account in which superstition, isolation and religious mania can play havoc with the mind, it excels in that nicely. Lots of symbolism abounds in this film, from ravens, goats, hares and the use of colour within the forest (the 'witch' has a red cloak). Much of the symbolism is about suppressed lust having no outlet within a religious household. The presence of the 'witch' as an older woman naked and milking one of the goats is loaded with metaphor and symbolism. It is not a particularly horrific film. There are some shocks and surprises but nothing really jumpy, just a slow burn.",7,8,15,14 August 2016
The Last King of Scotland," Brilliant film and standout performance from Forest
","Like, I suspect, a lot of people in the world, I know little or nothing about Uganda or her history. I do know something about Idi Amin but like so many Brits, we are fed only half truths and propaganda which suits other ends. This film follows the James McAvoy character Doctor McGarrigan from medical school, which he passes, through to his 'adventure' in Africa and Uganda in particular. His intentions are genuine enough; he wants to help the Ugandan people and render any medical assistance he can, but Uganda at this time is going through a massive political upheaval and McGarrigan, initially with Gillan Anderson's character, becomes awe-struck and fascinated by Amin's hypnotic brand of politics. After one incident involving a cow on the road, McGarrigan comes to Amin's attention and, finding out he is Scottish, is brought into Amin's political and family spheres.There is an element of innocence lost about this film. MacAvoy's character starts out as a wild eyed young man looking for adventure in Africa and encountering women on the way which he sleeps with. He falls for one of Amin's wives along the way, after helping the man's son who has epilepsy and becomes tangled up with her, only to get her pregnant (unsurprising, considering you have two quite young people together and contraception isn't used). Amin discovers this and kills his wife and unborn child horribly and then tortures McGarrigan with the aim of killing him. Fortunately for him, he escapes during a hostage rescue attempt.Several things stand out about this film. The first is obviously Forest Whitaker as Amin. He is completely believable and even looks the part and sounds it. The second is the portrayal of a country undergoing political change at a frightening pace and not always for the better, the third is Gillian Anderson in a good role. Another interesting point is the occasional perspective from which this is shot: it is shot not always from a white man's perspective although there are elements of 'deepest, darkest Africa' which creep in from time to time. For McAvoy's character, Africa is treated as an adventure: have fun, do a job and sleep with a few women. He is young enough to get away with it, up until a point.",8,2,5,7 June 2007
Lord of War," A treatise on the morality of the Arms trade from an arms trader
","Never has so much been said about the arms trade in this film than the beginning of it when we view the world from a bullet's point of view: from it's manufacture to it's subsequent use. This scene alone defines the tone of this whole film. Cage as ever plays a Ukranian born American citizen small time arms dealer. He might as well be one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse as he plies his trade literally all over the world. However, although he does extremely well for himself, he quickly realises that he has a problem in FBI man Jack Valentine who tries to find a reason to put him in jail without opening himself up to bribery. Cage's narration is an exercise in the sardonic, even black and dry humour that surely comes from an arms dealer who has seen too much of his product used in conflicts throughout the world, but particularly in Africa. He is called a Lord of War by an African leader but disagrees with the title, saying he is really a Warlord. The African leader replies 'I like my title best'.That really does sum up this film. There is a sly morality to it. Cage's character sells guns because he is 'good' at it and it is the only thing he really knows how to do well. Trade in death.",8,0,2,18 March 2006
Sherlock Holmes," Guy's nice turn at an old classic
","It can't be easy coming to something like Sherlock Holmes and trying to find a new angle on it, without completely throwing out the essence of what Holmes is all about. However, Guy Richie manages to do just that.The plot is a tangled one. Holmes and Watson are called to a mysterious house where a ritualistic ceremony is about to take place. Wielding the knife is the mysterious Lord Blackwood, played in very dark fashion by Mark Strong. Blackwood is finally arrested by Lestrade as usual and taken away. After a trial, Lord Blackwood is deemed to be guilty and subsequently hung. Before his death, he has a visit from Holmes. It is Doctor Watson who pronounces the man dead. Apparently. A few days later, Blackwood apparently rises from the dead and begins a reign of terror. It turns out that Blackwood is a member of some weird and wonderful Masonic style cult who are intent, on domination of the government and country. It is down to Holmes, Watson and a mysterious associate of Holmes to stop him. I came to this film, having read one book (A study in scarlet) and seen a number of TV series, including the Jeremy Brett Holmes. Initially, the trailer was very misleading, making this out to be an action film whereas it is one part action and mostly establishment of plot and delving into Holmes' relationship with Watson, who has moved out of Baker St and is trying to have a relationship with Mary, his fiancé. Downey Jr gives Holmes a nice, edgy performance, befitting with the character's upper class origins and intelligence. He also affords a glimpse into Holmes' experience as a bare-knuckle fighter which some purists feel is not in keeping with the character's origins at all. I personally felt Jude Law was good as Dr Watson, although the book makes Watson out to be an older man, dealing with the terrible consequences of fighting abroad and being world- weary in a way that Law doesn't quite manage to convey. Other characters are interesting but not particularly well realised. All in all, a nicely done movie. Plenty of good plot exposition and some fine moments. Richie has managed to give us attention to detail which is always nice and hasn't gone overboard with CGI, which has a tendency to happen when you're dealing with a London which really, for the most part, no longer exists.",8,1,2,26 May 2010
Fifty Shades of Grey," Not as bad as its been painted but not great
","We all know the story. Nervous college student Anastassia Steele goes to interview billionaire Christian Grey after her flatmate gives her the job owing to having a bad cold. The interview doesn't go too well. The questions she asks are frankly lousy and she's too nervous and extremely uncertain around the rather good looking young man in his incredibly modern office. After being ushered out by him, they say goodbye at the elevator and Ana breathes a much needed sigh of relief.Not long after, Grey visits her in the DIY store where she works on the precursor of buying DIY supplies. After several minutes of stumbling around and eyeing each other, Grey leaves but gives her his business card. Ana then finishes her exams and accompanies her friend Kate on a drinking session out. During the course of it, Ana phones up Grey in a moment of drunken bravery and admonishes him for giving her a set of Thomas Hardy first editions. He questions her quite frankly about her drinking and then she hangs up. She then goes outside and finds herself the object of her photographer Jose's unwanted attentions, but Grey is there to save the day. After all this, Ana finds herself waking up in a lovely hotel room being watched by a sweaty Grey. Again, he repeats his insistence that his tastes are rather singular but seems to be more drawn to her, this time, biting some of her toast in a playful manner. Grey then agrees for her to come to his apartment for a 'date'. She is picked up after her work and whisked by helicopter to Grey's home, an elegant apartment which is more hotel looking than home. After drinks and explanations, he gets her to sign a nondisclosure agreement then comes the big reveal. Ana is taken up to Grey's 'Playroom'. Naively, she believes this to mean a place where he stores his Xbox but it certainly isn't. What it is, is the elegant, opulently coloured and designed for purpose room for sexual bondage, domination and Sada-masochist activities. After showing her floggers, paddles, whips, canes, a frame system for restraint, a bench for spanking, a bed complete with more rings and restraints and a couch, he explains that this is what he enjoys and that he doesn't do conventional relationship type stuff.All of this seems extremely overwhelming and Ana is understandably shocked. She reveals to Grey that she has no experience of sexual matters as she is a virgin and he looks at her with new eyes. With no further ado on his part, he seeks to 'rectify' the situation and has sex with her. From this moment on, the film becomes very much about how their relationship is a to and fro. Grey tells Ana why he is the way he is in a forest walk and explains the influence of Elena, his 'Mrs Robinson' and why he was her submissive for some years. There are long moments where Ana researches the role he wants her to play, that of a sexual submissive and, with the help of a laptop given to her by Grey, begins to realise that she isn't sure this is what she wants. There is no doubt that she is enjoying sex with Grey but there is also that other side and its a difficult one. Eventually, Ana jumps in the deep end and decides to go into the playroom and gets involved. Prior to this point, the sex has been interesting and rather romantic, but then things get darker. Grey is in his element here and knows what he's doing. Yet all things have to come to an end and the end is heart rendering. Ana asks how 'bad' the punishment can be and Grey responds by beating her 6 times with a braided leather belt. Ana's horror at what he's done echoes and their story ends as it started: her in an elevator. Firstly, this film isn't the book. Yes, it shares the same characters as the book but that is where the similarity ends. This is a stylishly lit, well edited, beautifully rendered film.Even Grey's playroom is a work of art, both beautiful and intimidating. This is how you imagine a billionaire would conduct his BDSM lifestyle. The problem with this film is not the way it looks or the characters. Jamie Dornan is okay as Christian Grey but always looks as if he is fighting with the script and wants to say more meaningful things. Dakota Johnson's character of Ana is far better depicted in the movie than on the page. She is self-possessed, sure of what she wants and less naive than her book character, who looks very different in comparison. The Ana of the film is, for some parts, calling the shots. The Ana of the book is too nervous to know what she really wants. Again, the script does neither of these characters any favours. There are too many unintentionally funny moments there. Neither is the film depicting, as some have argued, domestic abuse. Christian Grey, at some points in the film, tells Ana that he is not right for her. Prior to showing her the playroom, he tells her that his helicopter is ready for him to take her home if she really wants to go. Ana is not forced or tied up against her will.",5,2,7,14 February 2015
Casino Royale," A proper tough guy hero in James Bond
","In the past, I have enjoyed James Bond movies simply because they had all the ingredients of a stylish action movie, namely, a tough guy who always wins, several beautiful women, lots of action and a bad guy who always gets his commeuppance. This James Bond movie is no exception even although the 'bad guy' is never really who you think it is.Daniel Craig was always a natural choice for Bond. Critics say his blonde hair and blue eyes completely ruled him out but his whole tough guy with a nice sense of humour makes him an easy choice for the producers to consider. He is not too hard a nut to crack, like Sean Connery or too smarmy like Roger Moore. He is more the Bond of the 21st century, a man's man who enjoys the company of women.The action scenes do not disappoint. There is a thrilling scaffolding and building site chase in the first section of the movie which leaves you wondering quite how they did it and later on, even during the card game sequences there is some action when Bond tackles the men behind Le Chiffre's game. There are also the cars; a new Ford Mondeo and, of course, an Aston Martin. Where would Bond be without his British sports car and all its useful glove compartment gear? The ladies are beautiful, of course. Eva Green has better stuff to say in this film and a well fleshed out role, although, for my money, she still wears too much make up. And of course, there is Judi Dench as 'M' who never allows her real feelings for Bond and his work get in the way of a good 'telling off'. Judi is excellent as always, although I wish they would give her more to do.The locations are everything you want in a Bond movie. Sunny, fascinating and dangerous. There is the Bahamas, Montenegro and Venice. Quite how they did the Venetian house destruction scene amazed me! All in all, don't worry too much about following the plot but enjoy the action, the ladies and above all THE MAN. Bond is really back and better than ever.",8,1,5,10 January 2007
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," JJ Abrams delivers a good one.
","*** Please don't read on if you don't want spoilers****From the first few words, and the title, we are on familiar but different territory. George Lucas has handed over the reins, once again, to another director in a bid to bring the final films to a satisfactory conclusion. I don't blame him. The film begins with the news that Luke Skywalker has disappeared and gone into a sort of exile. Desperate to find him is a former apprentice and now big bad guy of the remnants of the Empire ie The First Order. The First Order, who are the Empire but under a different leader are hunting for a map that shows Luke Skywalker's whereabouts. However, the map has been separated into several pieces, to be sure, and one of them is held by a village on the planet Jakku. To retrieve the final piece, Leia Organa, now General Leia, head of the Resistance dispatches her best pilot, Poe Dameron, Dameron, played by Oscar Isaac is a determined and very good pilot. He arrives on Jakku and talks with the head of the village and retrieves the piece, but before he is able to get it back to Leia, the First Order turn up and destroy both village and the leader, played by Max Von Sydow. Poe, before being captured, puts his piece of the puzzle into his robot BB8, a smaller, very agile version of R2. Poe is then captured by the new Darth Vader, or a Sith by the name of Kylo Ren. On the way, a stormtrooper by the name of Finn removes his helmet and realises he doesn't want to kill anymore. He goes back on-board his ship but realises that he has no place among the First Order stormtroopers.We leave both Poe and Ren and meet the other new member of the cast, namely, Jakku scavenger Rey, played by Daisy Riley. Rey, in the course of picking up scrap and the remains of dead Empire spaceships on the desert planet of Jakku runs into BB8, captured by another scrap hunter and befriends him. Despite temptation, she decides not to sell the droid. We learn that Rey is waiting for someone to come back and she's been waiting a long time. Like Luke before her, she also doesn't seem to have much of a life outside of her hard work for little reward.Back on-board the First Order ship, Ren tortures Poe to find the missing piece but gets nowhere. Finn helps to get Poe out and they fly off to Jakku. Sadly, it appears Poe hasn't made it and Finn is on his own. He finds Rey by helping her from being robbed in a market in Jakku. Chaos ensues when the First Order turn up and destroy a space ship. Finn and Rey unknowingly get aboard a ship kept for junk, only to find they have piloted the Millennium Falcon. Both get away with BB8 and find themselves being sucked into another ship, a scavenger. Looking to hide out, the pair hide in smugglers places, only to find they are found by the original former owners of the Falcon, Han Solo and Chewbaca the Wookie. They tell both of their plight and Han tells them that all they've heard about the Force, Luke and the Rebellion is true. Rey tells them they need to go to the Resistance and hand over BB8 who's information is valuable. Solo pilots them to another planet where they meet another alien but Rey leans something more about Luke. Finn decides that he has to go with others and leave Rey. After all, she is now with Han Solo who can get her to Leia and the Resistance. Its not as easy as that. There is a lot more going on. The true identity of Kylo Ren's family is revealed and Ren himself is unmasked. There is also one big upset but enough of that. I daresay once you've seen the film and know the reasons why it has happened, it becomes obvious why it was done and a sensible decision of Abrams to do it as well. The Force Awakens has plenty of the things which made the first Star Wars films so good: action and beautiful locations, which, for a change, look real, rather than the CGI'd to death backgrounds of the Lucas prequels. It has some strong characters, Kylo Ren is a character needing to find his place in the saga, Domhail Gleeson's General Hax adds a clear note, if slightly over-acted, Gwendoline Christie is heard rather than seen, residing in the Stormtrooper costume of Captain Phasma and Oscar Isaac and others bring some much needed fresh blood to a saga which was in danger of getting long past its sell by date. Its also nice to have Han Solo on board to bring some balance to the rather tiresome mythology which had gone overboard in the prequels.",9,4,18,19 December 2015
The Purge," America's drastic solution to crime
","The year is 2022, not too distantly into the future and America's crime levels are at an all time low, as is unemployment and the economic problems it has been suffering are almost a bad memory. The drastic solution which produced these results is something called The Purge. Each year, for 12 hours from 7pm to 7am, all crime is declared legal and the police and security services are suspended. In short, for 12 hours, America has become a state of anarchy. Cue: idealised American family the Sandins. Father Ethan Hawke is a security system salesman, Mother Lena Headley is a homemaker and mother. Along with their 2 children, Charlie and Zoe, this family seem the ideal. They all live in an exclusive community in beautiful, massive homes and surrounded by gossipy neighbours. The film begins just shortly before The Purge. Ethan is coming home and Lena is preparing a family meal and chatting with neighbours. Everything is as it should be. Nothing afoot. The couple's family is also joined briefly by Zoe's older boyfriend, who her father disapproves of. A family meal erupts into a feast of rude comments then the idealised family go into the communal security room and wait for the sirens to go off, signalling the beginning of the yearly Purge. As the family home becomes a Sandin fortress, Charlie wanders around and tries to settle down. Zoe makes out with her boyfriend and both adults talk about the benefits of The Purge, safe in the knowledge, that they won't be affected by its problems. All is well, until Charlie the son spots a fugitive pleading for help within the community. He's in deep distress, being shot at by a crowd of 20 something masked anarchists complete with smart suits, white dresses and horrid masks. Charlie decides to help the man and disarms the fortress system to let him in. Thus does the dynamic of the story change. Both parents don't know what to do with the stranger. To make matters instantly worse, his assailants are right behind him, a bunch of masked anarchists hungry for his blood, lead by a smartly dressed young man. Said young man wants them to hand over the fugitive so that he can be slaughtered and hey can be left alone. Easy choice really?So begins a real tale of moral dilemma on a par with films like Straw Dogs, Panic Room and The Strangers, a French movie on similar lines. Anarchists continue to taunt the family and ask them not too politely to turn 'the swine over. Family struggles trying to tie him up, preparing to throw him back to his assailants. It is at this point that the film descends into familiar territory. Still, matters not. It is a good idea which may have been better added to but doesn't suffer for not straying away from its main premise. There is an element, particularly at the end where you realise you don't know who your friends are.",7,2,9,31 May 2013
Pineapple Express," Potheads go crazy!
","I had few expectations about this film although I was intrigued by it. American humour, for me, either works completely and is laugh out loud or completely misses the point. This film, however, was different.Seth Rogan plays Dale Denton, a process server whose job it is to serve people as per the law eg with divorce papers or general legal proceedings. This involves him occasionally wearing a suit and handing legal papers to people who promptly swear back at him. In the meantime, between jobs, he's driving and smoking cannabis. Lots of cannabis. In fact, the whole movie's basic premise is the perils of being in the wrong place at the wrong time and being stoned.Enter Dale's drug dealer, Saul, an equally stoned and nonsense talking fellow who sells Dale the 'Pineapple Express' of the title, in this case, a particularly 'good' type of marijuana. And rare. So rare, in fact, that after witnessing a murder carried out by a drug dealer and a female cop, Dale dumps his roach and the drug dealer instantly recognises what it is and who he sold it to. Cue: a whole lot of trouble and fun! This film combines some of the daftest and most profane dialogue known to man, but unlike Tarentino's films, which also come packaged with profane language, there isn't the cruelty element. The dialogue is classic American older youth speak. There are some real moments of sheer laugh out loud stupidity, particularly when Saul and Dale realise what a mess they're in and try to sort it out. There are also 'nods' to other films, like Pulp Fiction's Jules and Vincent, in Ted Jones' two completely different hit men and also a big nod to American Beauty when Dale finally meets his girlfriend's parents.This is not a film to be taken very seriously. It is a lighthearted bit of nonsense but good fun and it has the spectacle of the normally po-faced and rather glum James Franco (of Spiderman fame) driving around with his foot caught in a car windscreen. What's not to like!",8,2,6,1 February 2009
