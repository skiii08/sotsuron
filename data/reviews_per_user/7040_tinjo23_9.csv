It," Not all that terrifying, but packs a surprising emotional punch.
","In a word: Impressive. This truly has all the right ingredients to be a great movie. Plus, even as a horror remake (despite leaning on serious horror clichés) it is by far the best made yet. However, with the release of Strange Things, you'd be hard pressed not too see the clear (but lacking), similarities between the two mediums. Furthermore (pretending as if 'Stranger Things' never existed), it owes much to King's other novel/movie adaptation 'Stand by Me' in the 'young kids in the 80's find meaning and maturity in their adventure days' plot line. But lets be clear; even comparing those two greats to this film, should make clear, what class of filmmaking is on display here. The strongest element of the movie is by far the cast, and they are, by all accounts, rock solid. Truly, you want them too live. Gifted child actors seem to be coming out the wood works these days and how great it is; allowing cinema to opt for a fresh, more unique perspective on old material. You could call them all idiots for the things they do, but truly, they are kids. They are daring, stupid, timid people. And (with the exception of how often they ignore injuries that require IMMEDIATE medical attention) what they do, never really ring false. On the contrary, very occasionally, their motives register astoundingly believable. And that is a hard thing to pull off in cinema.",7,4,11,7 September 2017
The Irishman," Scorsese's most mature and tragic work in years. Stripping back the glamour and allure of the gangster lifestyle and focusing on themes far more personal and painful.
","The first half is Scorsese, the familiar. Gangsters roam around doing nefarious, no good. Tracking shots, wipe fast editing, grisly violence and your Dad's favourite 60's and 70's playlist are all present. Only, this time with an added touch; a slight remove and sprinkles of melancholy. An element which truly comes into play during the movie's second half, which is the director at his most subtle, most deconstructive and possibly, most painful. De Niro's Frank Sheeran is not a far removed character from any previous Scorsese anti-hero, but he is quite possibly his most tragic. A man entirely void of emotional understanding to the people closest to him, the times he lives in or the life he's created for himself.At 3 and half hours it's a butt numbing experience and bloated around the middle, but breezier than you might expect and funnier. Furthermore, the cast is unbelievably packed and very few names are sidelined. Keitel, Paquin, Cannavale and Graham may appear than disappear at random intervals, but their presence (and relevance) remain forebodingly intact.
Higher up the ladder are of course Pacino and Pesci (the crowd favourites) and they are, who guessed it, incredible. With the exception of some hard to conceal stiff limbs Pacino is as energetic and electrifying as anything from his golden years. Pesci, almost the polar opposite of his previous Scorsese outings, opts for a calmer, far more controlled presence. Which frankly only makes the moments where his darker nature takes the wheel, all the more chilling.
But this is of course De Niro's show and he is the best he's been in a very long time. For Scorsese he opens up his every pore of talent and restrictively infuses the emotionally stunted Frank with pieces of humanity where ever possible.Ultimately though, what sets this apart is Scorsese. If you're a fan, it's his most mature work in decades and possibly his most personal since 'Raging Bull'
And if you've never heard of him, I recommend watching first 'Means Streets' and/or 'Goodfellas' if you'd like a crash course in the rise and twilight of the man's relationship with gangster cinema. A sub genre he himself breathed new life into over 50 years ago, that's still being mimicked today (mostly to gratuitous effect though).
So it only seems fair he gets to be the one to strip it down, put it on a scale and have final analysis on what a life of crime and violence is worth, in the end.",9,18,42,13 November 2019
Suicide Squad," Oh boy, where to start.
","For what is shown, it's solidly, okay. But among this mess of a blockbuster actually lies a descent story (in the first half at least) and neither the studio nor director Ayers, seem interested in exploring any of it. The Joker and Harley Quinns relationship, for example, is all show no tell. Why does she love him? Why does he love her? Because they're both insane, isn't an answer.It's not just those two love sick puppies whose characters get butchered by the power of editing, either. Everyone's back stories and motivations (the most interesting part of the movie) are made second (sometimes third) to a by-the-numbers 'defeat the bad guy' plot line. Only Smith's Deadshot gets any real screen time to offer reason to why he'd want to the save the world. The only problem is his character ark undercurrents 'Squads' entire central theme. These are suppose to be the bad guys right?What acting chops are shown off from the cast (and surprisingly, they're mostly pretty solid) are all but wasted on a film too concerned with getting to the finish before it's even begun. The DCCU has all but hit bottom this year, giving a real perspective to why some people really hate comic-book movies. I'd say, come 2017, proceed with caution WB, but I'm pretty sure that's what's gotten you into this mess.",5,22,46,4 August 2016
Pacific Rim," Whilst overambitious, trying to fit a mammoth plot into only two hours, Pacific Rim still delivers.
","I was so excited to finally see Pacific Rim. An ambitious idea, carried with big-budget effects, brought to you by master director Guillermo del Toro. I was pumped. I was hoping for brilliance, something to truly give other blockbusters a run for their money. The result, as I had to expect, was not that of a game changing event. Instead, it was more or less, directly in between Greatness and Disappointment. There's a lot to love about Pacific Rim, but where it suffers seems to be mostly through a lack of confidence in it's own premise.Like last years Les Miserables, Rim makes the unfortunate error of trying to fit in 3-4 hours worth of storytelling into just over 2. Which is unfortunate considering Pacific Rim's all round story is it's strongest element. Though taken from many sources, (and by no means, anything that original) it shapes a very well-throughout premise with detail and conviction. In it's execution of this however, is where the film stumbles. Mainly, the plot feels rushed. Condensing years of devastation and development, into one short montage (the first five minutes of the film covers the entire ark which Pacific Rim is built on: the first encounters of the Kaiju, the initial attempts to stop them and finally, the culmination of the Jaguar program) which contains enough story to fill an entire other movie. The intro then concludes with the untimely destruction of one of, what seemed to be, the human race's final salvation. From there is where the movie actually begins. Now while that's an interesting (somewhat ballsy) approach, this structure causes Rim to feel much smaller in scope than what it actually is. This story is HUGE as a concept and it should have translated that way. Unfortunately what is shown is both giant in scale and unjustly short. The film is set over a small amount of time, considering the attacks have been going on for years and though it covers many key events in the Kaiju war, it never really feels like you've been delivered the full picture.Now, on the positive side, if you focus your attention to what is on display, Pacific Rim excels. It flows with both confidence and conviction. Expecting a lot from the maker of Pan's Labyrinth and Hellboy 2, del Toro delivers with a lot of what made him great (even if you're mostly getting del Toro, the action director). The design of both Jeagar and Kaiju are brutal and majestic. The world in which Rim exists is one where any previous del Toro film could fit in with comfortably. Beautiful design. As well as that, being this is del Toro's first real entry into mega blockbuster territory (Hellboy 2 was big, but nothing close to this) there was initial concerns that maybe he would be out of his depths in bringing the all-out-brawls to the big screen. Luckily, he delivers there too.The Jaguar vs. Kaiju assaults are stellar, even if they're not the defining assault on your senses you were hoping for. When the standoffs begin, you are returned to your childhood, reminded of why you loved seeing things go bomb in the first place. It's big, it's exciting, it's unpredictable (well, some what) and it's just so must fun. Delivered, also, with a sense of peril for the characters, which is arguably the most important thing when creating great action. Which, for that, requires a group of characters to which you need to feel like giving a damn about.Though things have been said about the people of Rim, I found them to be well-rounded and developed. Though not reaching the arks of previous big-screen franchises (The Avengers, The Dark Knight), everyone is given enough to go with, to at least earn the right for us to care about them. The standout being Mako Mori played by Rinko Kikuchi who holds the stand-out scene of the movie, when she first steps foot inside the cockpit and co-pilots the Gypsy Danger... While on the other side of the hemisphere, Charlie Hunnam, taking leading position, brings the usual tough guy, stands-for-everything-right solider, with a delicacy that makes it feel more realistic than movie realistic. Supporting casts deliver also, with the always great Idris Elba doing well with a small role, while Charlie Day is much less annoying than what you may have previously anticipated and is convincing as the fumbling, genius scientist. And of course the always fun to watch Ron Perlman as shady, black market dealer Hannibal Chau. If you take Pacific Rim as a great action/adventure story you will find much to appreciate in it's delivery. Though, were it to have the self-confidence to deliver it's premise with more conviction and pacing, it could have been the best action film of the year. For what is on display however, there is very little to hate. Guillermo del Toro has done an exceptional job at bringing this mammoth concept to the big screen and delivering in, close to the way I had hoped. In the end, what you're left with is a great, thrilling experience that confirms that big robots fighting big monsters is actually a great idea for a movie.",8,185,340,11 July 2013
Captain America: Civil War," Hard hitting, mature filmmaking crossed with action-packed, hilarious fun.
","The greatest superhero movie ever made? Perhaps not. It's a judgement, I personally can only make after seeing this movie more than once. What I can say is this: If it were an average affair, the flaws and faults in the structure may have derailed this beast of a movie. But this is no average affair. Too put it simply, this is the best Marvel movie yet. Should there be anything better in the future, this franchise may very well stand as one of the greatest to have ever existed.We'll start with the flaws as I want them out of the way and they are more niggles than hard errors. The pace is fierce but patchy (what Marvel movie isn't). the beginning especially, is in a big hurry to get through, what is, a great deal of set up. The central conflict of this movie relies heavily on everything that comes before it however and here, character motivations are a little rushed. The ending, also, suffers in the same kind of way. You could also call a lot of the big moments an unfortunate case of 'I already know what's about to happen'...itis... HOWEVER! This is the full blockbuster ingredients list, cooked to near-perfection: Emotionally charged, intelligent, bold, hilarious, action-packed and so much fun. It's a proper grown up affair with a superhero stamp on it. It's engaging, it's interesting, all points on all sides are relevant and understandable and perhaps most importantly, this is firmly, a Captain America movie. Iron Man is there and he's a major player, but he is not the star of the show.All other players are integral and exciting to watch, especially that very special new player! His intro is hilarious. Even better, every character has a run in with each other at one point or another and most of them ooze amazing and often surprising chemistry with each other. The best of which get the least amount of screen time together, but leave the most satisfying mark.The overall story is very well thought out. It's spread over several different plot lines, but they all come together as one big, beast of a movie. Like I said, it's patchy, but Civil War makes the absolute most of it's run time to get in what's needed for the story and what is, all but demanded, from the viewer. The Russo brothers have done a very good job here. Infinity War only looks to be more promising with each new movie. Finally, the emotional heft. It's everywhere in this movie. This isn't a grim affair, but it is dark one. Many punches are inflicted on our heroes and if you love them as much as I do, it can be a hard watch. But it's real and at times, quite heart wrenching. This is a character story at it's core and despite the success of everything else, this, they absolutely needed to make work. And they do. It's not perfect, but it's the best Marvel has done so far to put that lump in your throat. Shed that tear. Make you wish everyone could just get along. But in the end, when the result is a movie this good, you may not actually want them too. As for sides: There are no easy choices, there are no easy results. There is only first class, grown up filmmaking.Highlight: The airport tussle. Trust me, the trailer spoils nothing.",9,13,28,29 April 2016
Avengers: Endgame," Holy... &%*$
","Keeping this spoiler free which means I can't really say much about anything. If I could sum it up, it would be... however prepared you think you are for what's coming, you're not even close. But it is blockbuster cinema at it's finest.The story and the characters are faultless. It's funny as hell, particularly the first half.
The action may lack but that's because this is a movie about the characters and the journey that's brought them all this way. It's probably the closest a blockbuster will successfully come close to an indie drama.The 3 hour run time does wonders, giving the movie, it's plot and it's actors and it's directors room to get very creative and pace it's emotional arks and it's complex story.If there are flaws, it's in the fan service, which runs extremely high (too great and small effect), causing some logic to wane and an inconsistent tone during important moments. Characters are shorthanded but if you expect anything less, you're expecting a 10 hour mini-series, not a single movie (3 hours or not).Given the scale, this is actually very well structured and entirely, emotionally walloping. Not just because of the 11 years of movies that came before it (though that helps).
There won't another quite like it for some time.",9,4,12,24 April 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," As expected, GoTG vol. 2 is entertainment central.
","The team are back and, as expected, there is no shortage in confidence or creativity. James Gunn knows how to enthral his audience. He shoots for fun and delivers it with style. It's structure fumbles, but collectively, is pretty unconventional. Which for a blockbuster is always a welcome. Where the 'Space Avengers' are lacking this time around, is in it's humour and it's character's emotional arks/developments, that made the first so heart warming. There are plenty of laughs, don't be fooled. The best come from the always dependable Rocket and Groot relationship. With Yondu of all characters, playing a part in the duo's (and perhaps the movies) biggest laugh. However, many jokes just don't land. It doesn't stifle the fun, but you may wish for a few more fresher yuks in the script. Along side that are the character motivations, which are often unconvincing and sometimes, unearned. One too many, sentimental back-story beats, that feel forced more than poignant, lower the drama. There's nothing here to match Quills relationship with his mother's final gift.Nevertheless. The team are a delight to watch, all involved are clearly having a blast (allowing us to have a blast with them) and with vol. 3 in the cards, this could prove to be one of the Marvel franchise's best trilogies.",8,36,71,25 April 2017
Joker," Phoenix and Phillips deliver compelling, mature work.
","Oh yeah, it's good. As a psychological study, it's a tad Hollywood, but as a comic book movie, it's something very unique indeed.
Probably the least surprising thing about the movie is Joaquin Pheonix's performance as Arthur Fleck; given his immaculate, decade long streak of complex, damaged characters.
But it would be a disservice to not praise what is quintessentially a make or break the movie role that Phoenix devours with every ounce of talent he possess. It is amazing!
But the real left field surprise comes from director Todd Phillips (most notable for the Hangover trilogy), who continues what has become something of trend for bad comedy directors (among them Peter Farrelly's Green Book and Craig Mazin's Chernobyl). Dishing out mature, genuinely affecting character dramas seemingly, from out of nowhere.",9,1,1,4 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Lucas couldn't have been more off the mark.
","To be fair, it's not hard to see why George Lucas decided to make this movie the way he did. With episode 1 and 2 ending up as failures for their crumby story lines why wouldn't he just give up and fill every scene up with endless amounts of action and special effects. I guess he figured doing that might finally get everyone off his back; too badNow to be harsh, this movie was not good. It was extremely rushed (especially around the end), poorly written and so very badly acted. This movie does not do justice to the star wars franchise; it sooner devours it. The whole movie is basically just a giant action/visual effects fiesta with no real ideas or story structure in the entire film. Every one of those 'scenes that need to happen to blend into A New Hope' were all very carelessly thought out, unbelievably rushed and in a few ways utterly disturbing: - Anakin's turn to the dark side happened faster than a bolt of lightning; it was like 'oh no I've killed Samuel L. Jackson cause he wasn't going to give you a corrupt, but well deserved trail-too-I'm ready to leave all my past morals and ethics behind and join you to kill little children' - Hmmm, how to kill Padme? Caught in a cross fire during one of the many actions scenes during the movie? No. Hunted down by an assassin or bounty hunter? Never happen! Dying during child birth with advanced technology that by that time could probably cure cancer, surrounding her; not to mention Obi-Wan? Genius!! I think we've got a winner...yeah okay - Fight scene between Yoda and Darth Sydius was a load of bull. If Samuel L. Jackson can kick the cr@p out of Palpatine then there's no way Yoda could possibly fail. At the very least not as badly as he did. But no, Palpatine needed to go on living to exist in the next three movies but at the same time the movie needed an awesome Yoda fight scene to make it complete; so Yoda had to fail for that to happen. - Okay, Anakin losing against Obi-Wan; had to happen. Obi-Wan cutting off Anakin's legs cause he's evil and was out of control so he had no choice-absolutely...let him burn to death so he can inevitably get saved and live to appear in three more movies instead of doing the human thing and KILL HIM QUICKLY!! WTF? And Anakin's suppose to be portrayed as the psycho in the movie! -And what about the whole plan by Yoda to completely tie the two movies together in a neat little bow...concocted in about all of 30 seconds, and covering about 10 minutes of the entire film all upbut hey it's only the most important part of the movie, why give that a large amount of screen time when we can watch Ewan McGregor attempt to quiver in pain and agony as his worst fears come to life.Oh and I know this is just me nit picking but it just annoyed me how unimaginative George Lucas actually was with this movie: - 'Okay you are now my apprentice, I shall now call you (Dramatic pause) Darth VaderI don't know why I'm calling you it, but that's now your nameit sounds cool' I hated this movie but I don't even give it the one star it so truly deserves because I like many others are subdued into some, if nor very mild submission over super, wicked, awesome special effects and kick ass fight scenes; which this film has in spades, if that's the only good thing I can say about it. Acting, Dialogue, Direction, Storyline all terrible. Visual effects, cinematography, make up, costume design, music all great. Its feast for the eyes and the earsuntil people start talking. Oh and one more nit picking thing that annoyed me; the last scene when Obi-Wan gives the baby to the woman and she walks off and shows it to the husband of hergod, you couldn't have said thank you or something!?! 'Thank you Obi-Wan for coming all this way to give me a FRICKEN BABY!!'! No?! Just look at him instead and walk off, that's polite. I'm sure if I were obi-wan I'd have a lot of confidence that I've just given the right people a baby!! After all they seemed so excited to have him!!",5,6,11,30 March 2009
