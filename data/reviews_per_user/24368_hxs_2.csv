3:10 to Yuma," Good acting, good progress...... bad ending
","The only thing that saves this movie was the good acting. The end is so bad and unbelievable. I am really surprised that all that good work ends in such a mess. Makes you feel robbed of the journey that is well carried out by Bale, Crowe and the others. I never saw the original and well, this just didn't go down well in the end. I would not recommend it to anyone. I'd rather recommend NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, though I am no Coen Bros fan. But then again, I guess there is a certain tendency in films being made these days (remakes or not) to really go downhill in the end. Perhaps time and writer's block at the end just makes them all pull down the curtains in anyway possible without thinking how it will sink with the audience. I simply can't understand why such an ending??? Perhaps, the cast and crew are playing some sort of joke by building interest, pulling us along and then laughing at us when we go 'HUH?' 'WHAT THE...' 'IS THAT IT??' 'I SAT THROUGH 2 HOURS TO GET TO THIS?!?' Waste of good talents (Love Crowe and looking at Bale closely) that carried this film and good direction.",2,2,5,5 May 2008
Hotel Rwanda," Excellent film
","One of the best films I have seen. Great cast, great acting and excellent portrayal of the main character. Its been a while since I saw it so I don't remember all details. But I did watch a documentary on the Paul and I wonder why no Oscars for that excellent portrayal by Don, down to the accent. Would recommend it to all who are tired of the run of the mill movies out there. The tale is of courage,of cunning, of survival and is true. How Paul tries to 'save up' on favors for a rainy day, how conditions make him form a man out to survive into a hero of his own scale to save others. How he deals with having to juggle his position between the factions that he belongs to and that of his wife. In bits and pieces, it is all there. And the end is amazing. A worthy film that portrays what sick things can happen and how easily we all turn a blind eye. Well this film reminds and tells us we were there and we were blind as it happened. Kudos to the cast and crew. Effort was complete, not just a quick documentary or total Hollywood whitewash of the topic. Characters are built and influences and incidents are interwoven well. 10/10 any day.",10,0,0,5 May 2008
