Hereditary," Not a horror!! More like a comedy!! Do not waste 2 hours of your life watching it!!
","7.3??? 7.3?? Are you serious?? There I was thinking 'oh that's a good rating for a horror!'... Well, it certainly doesn't reflect the film I saw, and that film certainly wasn't a horror!! Do not lose 2 hours of your life watching it! It starts slow.... gets a little promising and then very very slowly turns very very baaaaad and laughable! The only reason I gave it 3/10 was because there were a couple of scenes that were a bit creepy and Alex Wolff played a convincing part.... that's it! The only reason I watched it end was in the naive hope that there would be a good twist.... There wasn't!!",3,1,3,19 September 2018
Suicide Squad," Jared Leto as The Joker?? That's a joke in itself!!
","Not a lot to say really! The film was mediocre at best. Margot Robbie, Joel Kinnaman and Will Smith were good but that's it really. The story was very poor and some of the characters were not convincing at all, mostly Jared Leto as The Joker..., Really, what were they thinking?!? He was awful, painful to watch in fact! I just wouldn't bother if I was you!",4,1,1,31 March 2019
Bird Box," 5 words I never thought I'd say about a Sandra Bullock film.. That was a good film!
","I'll be honest, I didn't expect much from a film with Sandra Bullock in. But thought I'd give it a watch because of Sarah Paulson & John Malkovich. Very pleasantly surprised - the entire cast was good (even Sandra Bullock). Great story and kept me gripped for the duration. Definitely worth a watch if you like a good post apocalyptic film!",7,0,1,2 January 2019
It Chapter Two," More laughs than scares! Not as good as the first!
","If you're going to see this at the cinema - book a premier seat or take a cushion, cos you're in for the long haul!! 2 hours & 45 minutes was waaaaay too long!
Sadly it wasn't a patch on the first one for creepiness, it was more funny than scary, we found ourselves laughing at some of the effects/'jump scares'.
The performances were good, especially Pennywise and Bill Hadar, who stole the show.
A few nice little surprises in there too.
I've given it 7 mostly due to the performances mentioned above and the banter between both adult and child characters.
If you go see it, don't expect to be scared/freaked out like the first one - then you won't be as disappointed as us!",7,0,2,8 September 2019
