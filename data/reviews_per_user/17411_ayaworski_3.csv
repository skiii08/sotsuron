Sucker Punch," Deeper than you'd expect
","This film is deeper (in meaning and message) than you'd expect. Yes it has a lot of adult themes and it's covered in glitz, glam, blood and fights but that is only really superficial and mostly a distraction for what's really going on. This film does get better upon multiple viewing and the greater message for what's really going on becomes clear. It ends up becoming a much better movie. *spoiler now* Consider the fact that Babydoll is the main character, but she is not the protagonist. She is not the person the story is actually about, she is simply the most interesting person within the narrative to make it worth telling the story. I have a few theories.... As only the best movies are warranted for them.",9,6,8,22 October 2019
Life," Frightening and humanizing
",Takes a group of highly educated people and presents them with a monster who is smarter and more merciless than them. This movie makes a great juxtaposition between what it means to be human and how this thing (tho intelligent like us) cannot be further from us. Lower stars than it could because the movie dives right into that concept and completely misses their daily routine of using their education and training to run this ship.,8,1,2,16 December 2019
Annihilation," Soap bubbles....
","I'm supposed to be afraid of soap bubbles? And odd, but pretty plants? Going out there blind, for multiple expeditions in which people don't come back? Nope. Nope all day. They'd bomb the bloody hell out of the damn thing. Especially if it's based in the states.",5,4,5,18 December 2019
