The New World," A slow and powerful portrayal of love
","When i finished watching this movie i was awestruck by its beauty and sensitivity. The animated version of the Pochahontas is of course childish, but this tale of Pochahontas sheds light on what really transpired when the first settlers came to Virginia. It reveals the terrible hardships of the first settlers who came to Virginia, and how they failed to realize the beauty of the land that the Native Americans knew so well.But what really moved me is the wonderful, selfless love that Roth gives Pochahontas and how he mends her heart after Smith's restless soul crushes it. The different levels of love portrayed in the movie are rich, beautiful and realistic; all shown with the amazing backdrop of a still wild America.",9,3,5,12 January 2009
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A Fitting End To An Epic Adventure
","This magical series of films which chronicled the ascent of Luke Skywalker from a boy living in the desert with his aunt and uncle, to a great Jedi Master who is even more powerful than his father, captured my imagination as a child. Return Of The Jedi provides those faithful to the films with closure and also a glimpse of a magical film that finished with the brilliance of it predecessors. The special effects of this film are astounding, proving that the movies only improved in this aspect. The beginning of the movie is spellbinding from Luke's attempt to play a mind trick upon Jabba The Hut to their escape from the monster in the desert. The romantic connection between Princess Laie and Han Solo is realized at last, and also adds special meaning to the film. Overall this movie is superb, flawlessly showcasing the genius of George Lucas.",9,0,1,15 April 2009
The Doors," Like being on lsd
","Jim Morrison is a very mysterious figure who is intertwined in the 60's so completely that it's almost as if he couldn't live part that era. This film is extremely sycadelic and makes one realise how much of a problem living actually was for him. He had so many addictions and so much confusion that it was the end of him when it came down to it. His songs were poetic, strange and brilliant but beyond the comprehension of most. Fame devoured him, and this movie gives a very good depiction of this. His performances are unlike any one since, and perhaps this is for the best because some one as volatile and magical as Jim Morrison is not meant for this life.",7,2,2,14 April 2009
The Shining," A film made good by Lack Nicholson
","Although Stanley Kubrik is a brilliant director, he took Stephen King's masterpiece and reduced it to a horror film with good cinematography and one good performance. In the novel the main character is a good man with many personal demons, but The Overlook Hotel is the entity which is evil and influences the main character. In the movie Stanley Kubrik makes it look like Nicholson's character is evil from the very beginning and that the hotel has hardly anything to do with his madness. Another problem with the film is that the role of the wife is horribly miscast. In the book she is desperate to protect her son and terrified by the transformation in her husband. In the film she comes across as some idiot wielding a knife, and is neither capable enough of protecting herself or her son. The ending of the movie is completely wrong, and conveys none of the sacrifice he finally commits at the end of the novel. Substituting the main character blowing up the Overlook and himself with Nicholson freezing to death in the maze was hardly right, and left me completely unsatisfied.",8,0,0,7 April 2009
Quantum of Solace," Anyone who doesn't enjoy this movie, shouldn't call themselves a Bond fan
","I saw this movie this Saturday and I have to begin by saying that this film is absolutely brilliant! In my opinion it's about ten times better that Casino Royale, which was slow and lacked any of the usual Bond high speed storyline.This film throws you into the world of 007 as soon as it begins, portraying him as he should be- at 400kms an hour non-stop! There is not one moment in this film where you are left bored or wondering what the hell is happening. You're so jilted and awed by the supreme action and top notch acting, that when you walk out the movie house, it's difficult not to sway drunkenly towards the exit!Daniel Craig is a magnificent Bond, taking us back to the day of Sean Connery's blunt and brutal 007 that shoots first and asks question later. There is not an iota of softness or glorified dancing about that they pass of as fight scenes. Everything is hand to hand, raw fighting to the very death!Daniel Craig and everyone else involved in Quantum of Solace has pulled us from the foppish charm, and dead fish handshakes of Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan's suave charm, to an action character that will survive the desert, escape from burning hotels and kill you if you even so much as think about double crossing him!",10,6,15,24 November 2008
Legends of the Fall," Innocence Lost
","How can we define ourselves without love? How can we actually understand or communicate fully with other human beings without sacrifice? It is in this film that we come to understand the price we pay for love and how it can ruin our lives, robbing us of all other goals and ambitions- bringing us to our knees. Tristan, the bad boy, the troubled soul-the favourite son, how can we define him in such simple terms? How can we ever truly comprehend the emotions he feels during this movie and how his emotions destroy he and his family. This film explores so many kinds of love, so many kinds of loss. In it we find a group of characters who must deal with tragedy, all consuming love and the desire for true happiness.",9,1,3,27 March 2009
Stardust," Stardust
","When I watched this movie for the first time it was like seeing a fantasy movie that was actually more fantasy for a change and not convoluted by too much romance, too few villains or over the top effects that were placed in a part to fill space. The performances in this movie were wonderful, and didn't reek of reading from a board or being too over practiced. The cast meshed naturally and didn't feel the need to act as if they really were just acting for a film. The ideas of the story were great too, and they really stuck to the book. I'm also happy that they used cynical humour if you will, rather than humour that was too obvious or complex. The emotions that the characters also portrayed were not those of a soap opera, but believable enough to be put into everyday life. When Claire Danes confesses her love for Charlie Cox, it was so cute because he was a mouse in that bit and she was a star who claimed to be cynical about love. Also Claire is absolutely stunning and manages to be a good actress without making other females get wildly irritated with her because she obviously sold her looks rather than developed her acting. Charlie was so sweet too, he portrayed boyish charm and innocence, as well as being slightly inexperienced in many areas without seeming too dim. Sienna Miller was lovely as the stuck up love of Charlie's life, perfect as the girl in the small village who is beautiful and has been spoilt by obvious attention from every male this side of the seven seas. Micheal Phiffer was absolutely superb as the wicked witch, managing to be beautiful and hideous in the movie and still make me laugh. And the cast of brothers were so hilarious that the fact that they each had a hand in one another's demise didn't make me utterly shocked and stuck on that matter. Peter O' Tool was very funny as the father too in his cameo. I am absolutely in love with this film all round! I went to see a fantasy and also got love, adventure, drama, dark comedy, and I wasn't so bored that I could guess every line the actors would say before hand and also expect a happy ending from the get go! It was also refreshing to see Robert Di Nero as a transvestite pirate! What more can you possibly hope for in a movie? Trust me previews and trailers and teasers of this film do not do it justice!!",10,1,1,29 November 2007
From Hell," What A Film
","This film is wonderful. It's so powerful dark and brilliant. Johnny Depp is absolutely magical and enthralling as Inspector Abelaine. The mood of the film is so excellent and contributes greatly to the content of the film. Some will say that too much poetic license was used, but analyzing this movie is boring and stupid. The casting is superb, the sets wonderfully authentic and the costumes a colourful array representing the 19th century. Heather Graham gives one of her only good and solid performances as Mary Kelly. It is a simply masterfully executed film with twist and turns, and the thrilling execution of a well trained butcher.",8,0,1,1 June 2009
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Who The Heck Has That Much Blood In Their Body?
","The Nightmare on Elm Street films are low budget, sick and vaguely funny but still total cult classics. No one else could be Freddy but England, he's the reason the films work. The story line in this film is very original though, because the idea of your nightmares affecting you in the real world was unexplored before this film. The effects in this film also show that people were far easier to please in the twentieth century than now. The horror scenes in the movie are mostly impossible, especially the part where Johnny Depp dies and like a fountain of blood comes out of him. But overall this movie is extremely entertaining, and something to remember the eighties by.",6,1,1,19 May 2009
