The Blair Witch Project," This is the most taste-less movie I have ever seen!
","Hi,This movie is so horrible because this actually happened to real people! Come on! You should feel less of what you are if you created this movie! I have written the family before. It is really pathetic when you have people act out a horrid event! The cousin was the only one who saw what this movie was, it's trash! This is like a second rate Texas Chaisaw Massicar! I think that movie is trash to because, actual people died! Grow up and make better movies! Some of you may remember the Scream movie. After the 3rd one came out I had something very similar happen to me like that. But first it started with a car and then the calls and then people following me and attempted murder. I someone ever made a movie of that, you bet I'd be mad! Think of others!-Allen",10,1,3,13 December 2005
