The Monuments Men," Consensus
","It seems to me nearly all of the reviews thus far (Feb. 2014) have at least something good to say about a flawed movie. Seldom is there so much consensus across the spectrum. I viewed it on opening day with great expectations and came away thinking of it as only a curiosity, a tale with two possible aspects. First, I found it just another 1960's style WWII narrative with a slightly lighthearted American perspective to accompany its musical score. But upon further viewing more somber elements took over.Based on certain historical facts, the script compels a certain suspension of disbelief. In the event, however, the facts as presented seem not only fragmented, but interpreted across the board so as to make heroes of several very ordinary guys trying to do an impossible job: namely, dispelling horrors of war by making sure objets d'art survived intact. Political swipes at all them 'furriners' especially Germans and Russians provided an unhappy and distasteful undertone.Occasionally great cinematic art itself cannot and probably should not survive its critics.",6,3,4,12 February 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Generational Gap
","Without Johnny Depp, this basically animatronic mess would have been ignored by anyone with half a brain.  But the general reactions to it underscore one aspect in particular:  popular films, whether truly good or truly bad, have lately demonstrated that a large component of the viewing audience haven't a clue about what constitutes good cinematic art.While many of us of a certain age look at movies as an extension of dramatic art moving forward in time from Aristophanes to Arthur Miller, just as many if not more of us seem to evaluate them based primarily on the sort of criteria usually reserved for rating computer games and cartoons. Literature and history be damned; if it ain't got visual sparks, it ain't no good.I did manage to stay awake through this one, wondering from time to time what the hell I was doing it for.  Depp provided the sole depth, an ironic gem in the midst of a sea of motile muck.",2,4,8,21 March 2004
"I Love You, Man"," A Curiosity
","This movie is currently knocking about on the HBO channels, rather like a fill-in for something more useful or entertaining. Set in L.A., it looks very much like a hundred or so other films made for TV recently that center on the 'boy meets girl;boy is a jerk;boy loses girl;boy gets girl back;both wind up in lavish and tear-jerker wedding' formula. The central premise is such a creaky bromide that it has to depend on mostly decent production values to sustain the viewer's interest over the course of an hour or so with nothing better to watch.One or two further observations are necessary. First, the idea that a young slacker in California real estate these days can lead the kind of life portrayed here is ridiculous on the face of it. Second, the character of the best friend is far too soft in contrast to his hard and cynical observations. And his Venice beach house with its expensive furnishings belie any reasonable assertion of poverty or even semi- poverty. In short, the whole thing smacks of a TV reality-show concept within which a feel-good conclusion results after a series of obvious episodes involving standard clichés handed down from 18th-century Restoration stage comedies. Been there, done that.",5,1,3,25 April 2010
Brokeback Mountain," Finally Arrives at the HBO-Bravo State
","OK, this is a little late in the game, and no one is likely to read it anyway, but history requires the perspective of age in order to elude snap responses that usually get it wrong.The movie and the story on which it is based are both fine pieces of creative work. I am familiar with both. Moreover, I lived in Wyoming sheep country for several years in the early 1960's myself. I knew lots of the folks characterized in this film, from preposterous uptight rednecks to gay sheepherders to cowgirl floozies. Annie Proulx got it all right. So much for that.Now that millions of people who don't go to the cinema and don't buy books or CD's are seeing the movie for the first time on cable, it seems appropriate to add a word or two to the thousands already written here. Even if you don't read through all the comments as an aid to understanding all the different points of view BB has opened up since it came to the screen in 2005 -- and you're seeing it now for the first time -- there is still time and need for you to offer your own fresh insights.Mine are as follows: (1) the visuals and the score cannot be faulted; (2) the text is open to question -- read the original story and you'll see why; (3) direction and editing are generally quite good; (4) acting tends to melodrama, which in turn accents the one flaw in an otherwise compelling story -- sentimentality that obscures basic character development.On the last point, sentiment itself is not a bad thing. It is the emotional basis of love. But one's need for love in one form or another is complex as to its origins. To set out to touch someone's heart is a task requiring more than inducing people to laugh or cry; it requires intellect as well. In other words, you don't need to like the characters or what they do in a film in order to appreciate them as fellow human beings. The film version of this story pulls too many punches in order to soften the image of the two main characters. It's just too easy to cry at the end and forget that both of these guys made some really bad choices as a result of a lack of honesty to their true natures and personal courage.The short story provides a basis for better interpreting the film.It also undercuts gratuitous and often subliminal gay-bashing that characterizes the usual suspects who rate this film merely on the basis of offended tastes.",10,11,12,28 June 2008
Milk," One of the ten best films of the decade
","Even those unsympathetic to the political message of this film would have to admit its superb dramatic expression of that message. Rarely does one find such consonance between writer, actor, and director. Penn's trenchant portrayal of Harvey Milk will be studied by aspiring actors for at least a generation if not longer.It is no mean task for a filmmaker to take on a gripping true story where the ending is known in advance. There are no clichés here, no shortcuts, no tongue-in-cheek asides. The script follows a logical development of the eponymous character despite sudden shifts in time, and winds up at the end without disturbing anyone's sense of suspense. It's hard to say whether that attribute stems from the writer or the director; I suppose in all fairness one must cite it as the result of close collaboration.I first viewed this film on a four-inch screen in a transatlantic flight from London to Chicago. Not even the stunning beauty of glaciers in Greenland could sway my attention from it. When I saw it later on a normal screen I was even more impressed by its excellence.Watch it not so much for the message as for the basic humanity conveyed.",10,0,3,30 April 2010
Life of Pi," Technical Brilliance
","I have not worn 3D glasses since watching Bwana Devil in the early 50's. It was a surprise to discover that the process has been improved upon. The clumsy paper frame with two plastic lenses, one red and one green as I recall, have given way to what might pass for ordinary sunglasses, and the screen effect is quite satisfying.I also liked the superb animation in this film. I have no idea at all how it was achieved, having not yet bothered to read other people's reviews. Not only are the various animals made to act in a certain manner consistent with the story line, the visual images seem uncannily true to life.That said, I found the conclusion of the narrative ever so slightly sententious and disingenuous, suggesting two possible interpretations the viewer might entertain. What had been up to that point an exciting and colorful tour de force became instantly pallid. For what it's worth, I chose the allegorical version.As a frequent traveler on cruise ships that offer on-board cinemas, I can confidently say this film will never be shown there. My physical response to the maritime scenes even knowing I was actually surrounded by desert bordered on nausea.",8,1,4,19 December 2012
The Alamo," A few words to describe many
","Apart from colorful and dramatic sequences that play lavishly over the screen, imparting a generally correct and truthful sense of place as well as history, this is a movie of words.  Too many in some places and too few in others.This is not the cartoonish Alamo of Fess Parker or John Wayne.  Thankfully so.  But neither is it a summary of all that was actually good or bad about the seminal event that created 'Texas' as a concept bigger than life and arguably still representative of the changing frontier in North America.To put it briefly, I liked what was here but came away dismayed by what was not here.  Any movie that presumes to portray an actual and well-documented historical event must do more than touch on this or that fragment of fact. The production staff is obliged to accept what is presented to them by the writers, the actors, and the director -- leaving on the cutting room floor only irrelevant scraps.  I have the feeling that procedure was not followed here.  Too many threads holding the story together are missing.For example, the single most important motive lying at the heart of the Texas rebellion is inadequately explained.  Was it merely greed and personal ambition on both sides that created the conflict?  Or racial and ethnic disputes?  Or Manifest Destiny?  There is absolutely no clear picture to be gained from this movie that sets in perspective what the fuss was all about. Yet we have glorious and stirring speeches (or at least aphorisms) emanating from all parties, delineating character rather well but existing only in an isolated truth here or a compelling argument there.Somewhere on that cutting room floor, I suspect, are scenes that focus less on individual character and more on the fact that 'Texians' were a unique combination of English-speaking and Spanish-speaking citizens of the newly-created nation of Mexico, a remote outpost or colony of the central government that grew too large for that government to handle.  In that sense, it was just like any other historical event reflecting a desire on the part of a distinct group of persons living at the edge of an empire to achieve self-government.When seen thus, the merging of cultural differences that characterize Texas even today presents a unified entity of mutual interest.  What holds this story together, as very ably shown in bits and pieces of the film, is how important it is to recognize what humanity holds in common in spite of apparent differences.Little wonder that Billy Bob Thornton as Davy Crockett steals the show. (Unlike Dennis Quaid as a one-dimensional caricature of my collateral ancestor Sam Houston.)  This movie could have been another thirty minutes longer and mutually subtitled to get at the heart of its message.  No Oscars for the current cut.",7,9,11,17 April 2004
Pearl Harbor," Shock and Awe
","Not the movie.  I mean the number and variety of comments here.  The question is why this third-rate flick merits all these weapons of mass destruction aimed at it by critics and viewers alike.The history has been done before, and better.  The love stories with the historical event as backdrop have been done before, and better.  The film pyrotechnics have been done before, and better.  Hawaii has been done before, and better.  And the acting, such as it is, represents a new nadir within the entire context of all these categories and more.  Ben who?  Oh, you mean the guy who would be a nobody but for hanging on to the bootstraps of Matt Damon.  Everything else is just a blur of publicity hype and exploitation of sentiment generated by the 60th anniversary of the attack.  What grieves me most is to see those of my own generation who remember the day with greater clarity than 9/11 get teary-eyed when anything at all -- even dreck like this -- reminds them of the actual event and the unparalleled suffering that it caused then and for the next four years.  Anyone under the age of 65 cannot begin to fathom the true emotions swelling yet beneath the placid surface in our retirement communities.  We are constantly looking for that bit of actual war footage showing even a glimpse of a familiar face gone forever. (And this says nothing of the equally great tragedy of Vietnam and the films it inspired.)Some memories should not be toyed with.  My advice for those who enjoy war stories is to concentrate on those that take place in the future, as cautionary tales.",3,0,1,17 July 2003
City of God," As they say, 'And now the film....'
","I have waited for some time to view the dvd from Netflix, and when it finally arrived this week I watched it with great interest.  Previously, I had read some of the reviews and in fact discussed the film last week with a really bright Brazilian kid as he shined my shoes in a big Washington hotel. Hardly an objective lead up to actually seeing and reviewing the film, but since another Imdb subscriber recently took me to task (lamely, it must be noted) for being unoriginal, I wanted to provide a full disclaimer.
First, this is not a bad film at all.  It may not be as great as the hype and ratings suggest, but it has a lot of things going for it that easily transcend all the chatter.  I like its internal structure, well edited if not totally original, portraying the interconnected lives of a small group of favela dwellers over a period of time.  Although fast-paced, the story thread is never lost, and part of its charm is that it separates the essential humanity (or lack thereof) of the characters themselves from the changing context in which we see them from time to time as they develop or evolve.  That is where art divides from any overt political screed.To me, filmed evocations of violence properly contrasted with a message of hope are not objectionable in and of themselves.  And they can be seen in any culture, in any country, at any time.  The measure of cinematic excellence rests on whether art effectively connects with its objects, and is ultimately truthful to its own message irrespective of how the viewer otherwise regards that message.As someone intimately connected with a sharply divided community in terms of culture and class, I sense that this story is indeed universally applicable, and the film itself is a fine piece of work in telling that story.",9,0,2,13 June 2004
Good Will Hunting," The Importance of Not Being Too Earnest
","This is just a movie, folks, not a case study.  As interested as I am in literary, historical, and sociological elements of dramatic films, I am put off by psychoanalysis or tortured deconstruction.What I liked about this one was Robin Williams' underplaying his role and Matt Damon's totally cold and rigid self-characterization -- apart from the conclusion, that is.  There is a good sense of Boston as well.The premise of the story is questionable as to any sense of consistent authenticity.  Antisocial behavior need not be a concomitant of genius, as other recent films about gifted but more or less detached characters seem to take for granted (as does this one).  Neither are saccharine catharses inevitable.  And the usually fine actor Stellan Skarsgard as the American professor with a French name and a Swedish accent seems miscast.  Ben Affleck plays Ben Affleck with a passion, not unusual in a sense but hardly commendable in terms of his overblown popular persona.  One wonders indeed how he figures in real life as putative co-author of this fairly decent screenplay.In short, there are some good moments and good lines -- and that is really what counts, even when the finished whole is less interesting or convincing than the finite parts.  Worth seeing.  7 of 10.",7,1,4,1 September 2003
Call Me by Your Name," Non mangiare la pesca!
","Of course this movie is badly in need of editing. It goes on much too long. More to the point, its episodic construction begs the question as to why parts were not cut during previews. For example, the entire winter segment at the end is gratuitous excess. Otherwise, this is Chalamet's movie, pure and simple. The rest of the cast are supporting members. Hammer is predictably flat and the parents are clichés. The scenery is the young man's only equal. Though Lombardy never looked so good in so many of its parts, from Lago di Garda to Bergamo, this story rests on a single star directed superbly by a director whose craft shows through.Cast aside all the unnecessary hype and sentimentality, and just enjoy it.",8,2,7,18 February 2018
Meet Joe Black," Tradition
","One has to admire dogged admiration of an established tradition for its own sake, however misguided or foolish it may be. Rather like our national penchant for elevating family scions and movie actors to be heads of state, Hollywood chooses to produce its own brand of Stepford Husbands and foist them off on sentimental audiences until the last possible dollar can be wrung out at the box office.In the tradition of aging Kewpie dolls like Ryan O'Neal, Warren Beatty, and Robert Redford, we now have Brad Pitt joining the parade. As Dorothy Parker might have said of him, he displays the full range of thespian emotion from A to B. I think he probably got as far as 'bewilderment' in this dismal and tedious remake. It must have been a painful job for the hairdresser to keep his golden hair strands properly mussed from scene to scene, given that everything else about him suggests wooden immobility.Beautiful as the sets and costumes are, and with at least some of the cast able to generate a spark or two, this lifeless attempt to find profundity in cheap sentiment is not worth a second glance.And, in order not to beg the question, I admit that I watched it only as a way to fill some time waiting for the postman to arrive with my social security check. The luxury of tedium.",3,1,2,21 September 2004
Lincoln," A Full House
","At a noon screening I sat in a full house of mainly seniors but also some young folks who appreciated the mood and gravity of the narrative as it reflected our own time as it did that of the debate and passing of the 13th Amendment. To my pleasant surprise, the crowd laughed at the right times and remained silent at the right times. Complicated history laid bare as stark reality rarely elicits such insight from a mixed audience. I attributed their discernment, perhaps too generously, to the fact we have good schools and great teachers in our community. A snobbish but natural reaction.Daniel Day Lewis will almost surely receive an Oscar nomination for his thoughtful performance of Lincoln. Indeed all the main characters may be nominated in one form or another, as will the director and the production staff. This is not merely a good film but a great one.If I have one reservation, it is that the opening scene in which a group of soldiers ponderously recite parts of the Gettysburg Address seemed curiously staged, rather like having schoolboys stand at a PTA meeting to take turns mouthing patriotic slogans. A jarring departure, and too reminiscent of modern political correctness from an otherwise compelling drama. I hope the outtakes will someday be available. I could have watched another hour or so without complaint.",10,6,13,18 November 2012
Mulholland Drive," Comment Nr. 1179
","Can you believe that over a thousand comments have already been delivered about this piece of work? That begs the question all over again. What it comes down to is that either this is a stupendous work of art or another one of Lynch's tricks.I tend not to appreciate works of art presented as works of art. They posit logical polarities that have nothing to do with external points of view, relying instead on constant internal self-reference. 'Memento' comes to mind. Rather like the snake eating it's tail.Puncturing pomposity is not all that difficult, and some of the previous posts have done it admirably. I particularly like the one addressed to us from 'Wellville Colorado.' On the other hand, I sympathize with others who have difficulty seeing through the premise and construct this film, and wonder if there is something wrong with them for not liking it.Come on, just say you don't like it. The bogey man won't get you.",1,3,11,26 September 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Absolutely Hilarious Self-Parody
","Normally I do not comment on this kind of movie, but I was a captive audience of one and now feel compelled to write something if only for those of us who literally fall off our chairs laughing at the gullibility of people who take this stuff seriously.Space age technology delivering a form of entertainment designed for one of two kinds of viewers:  those who are looking strictly for flash and those who never got beyond kindergarten in matters requiring critical thinking. That about sums it up except for wondering what Tarantino is really up to in delivering live cartoons as if they were serious (or even popular) literature.My own guess is that he is making fun of himself making fun of his audience. Not that there's anything wrong with that.",1,18,34,13 October 2003
Stalingrad," Vilsmaier Strikes Again
","Some of the best directors ever have come out of Germany and other central European countries. Vilsmaier is not one of them. Whether he is primarily responsible for the cut of 'Stalingrad' I just rented from Netflix or someone else perpetrated it I do not know. But what could have been an excellent film is rendered just so-so by sloppy editing, obvious caricatures, uninspired panorama shots, and a soundtrack that seems to have been dubbed after the fact.And then there is the predictable rapid-fire dialogue utterly destroying any sense of subtlety or inner tension inherent in some otherwise very good character portrayals. I do not fault the actors. Whenever they do have a chance to go deeper into an odd bit of dialogue, there seems to follow a figurative pie-in-the-face or sudden thrust in another direction entirely.I thought the fictional though contrived main plot at least equal to those of any one of hundreds of other war movies. There is nothing unique involved here -- in spite of a tendency on the part of many viewers to re-live the specific tactics or political background in which the story progresses. War is war. I first heard that expression from a German cousin of mine who lost his only son (a Wehrmacht Lieutenant) at Stalingrad, and the sad finality in his voice still echoes in my head.So, although I followed the character of Witzland (curious name, that) from beginning to end with more than a little personal identification, I vote this one no more than a high average.",8,3,5,8 November 2004
The Great Escape," Something not often noted
","This film may have its detractors, but I am not one of them.  I saw it first in 1963 when I was a graduate student in Germany.  What stood out then in everyone's mind was that it was absolutely true to its time and location. The German actors were indeed German, and not all of them were portrayed unsympathetically.  Anyone traveling through Germany at that time would see many sections of the larger cities that remained in ruins.  Yet there was evident a popular feeling that the country had largely been reborn and had rejoined the mainstream of European life and culture, as had Italy and other formerly fascist states.Films made shortly after (say, 1948 to 1965) and about about World War II in Europe, whether they were entirely fictional or based on fragments of fact -- as was this one -- seem always to have been either very good or very bad at portraying history within their own internal contexts.  This one belongs among the former, together with 'The Third Man ' 'Battleground,' 'The Devil Makes Three,' and -- yes -- 'The Sound of Music.'  The contrast with truly awful stuff like the television comedy 'Hogan's Heroes' or action pix like 'Guns of Navarone' or tendentious stuff like 'The Night Porter' is sharp and painful to anyone sensitive to broader historical truths.Comments on artistic value and style aside, great movies based on recent history are in part great because they reflect those truths. More fanciful images that distort reality may be chic, but I tend not to value them very highly.",9,1,2,15 June 2003
Gangs of New York," Nothing Left to the Imagination
","What a shame Scorcese has apparently begun to believe his own stuff. I suppose if he can raise millions upon millions for a production there are limitless possibilities, so why not squeeze in as many disparate elements as you can?While it is true that the draft riots in New York occupy a significant page or two in the history of the Civil War, their unique relationship to the larger and ongoing question of anti-immigrant sentiment is more like a footnote to that greatest of all American episodes. Federalism has never set well with the American masses, especially those that made up the segment of the population known both before and since as Nativists. It was the frontier that gave birth to the popular notion of Manifest Destiny and all the other myths upon which the Nativists continue to feed. Paradoxically it was also the frontier that nurtured the belief that immigrants who became true-blue Americans were entitled to full social equality and a great share in the riches emanating from that ever-shining goal in the West.I don't think this film wants to deal with any of that. It begins and ends as a formulaic Hollywood blockbuster, colored a curious orange all the way through as if to mimic someone's sense of what a world filled with candlelight might have looked like. Everything about it is overblown, the kind of film where one expects to see a smiling extra peeking out at the camera from time to time. It is almost like an old musical without the music, where everything seems choreographed rather than natural. What a shame.Everyone knows that Daniel Day-Lewis steals the show, so I won't labor that point. Di Caprio is out of his element, which is playing roles without rough edges. Diaz is the typical stage ingenue. The rest of the cast march solidly through their lines without missing a beat from the director. I wonder... where have I seen this before? Answer, in many other films from D.W. Griffith to Frank Capra to the older version of Martin Scorcese.Time to hang up the stovepipe hat.",7,0,1,15 October 2004
Donnie Darko," The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
","When a contemporary film captures the attention of many persons willing to vote and offer comments on this site, it means usually that it is some high-budget, well-publicized piece of schlock featuring some non-actor like the Arnold or the Bruce. All glitz and technical appeal with little or no artistic merit. This one is in part an exception to that formula.To be sure, it is a very slick bit of movie-making with all the usual gimmicks involving computerized visuals and time bending, but it simultaneously offers extraordinary appeal in character development and some very good acting indeed. Just to mention the obvious: young Jake Gyllenhall, Mary McDonnell, Noah Wyle, Katharine Ross, and even Drew Barrymore (who for once plays a role with subtlety and depth).So much for the good and the bad. The ugly is of no consequence unless one buys into all the superfluous stuff that constitutes plot. That is nothing more than overwrought and pretentious drivel -- rabbit costumes and wormholes and airplane parts dropping out of the sky, etc., etc.Look instead for what is truly worthwhile social commentary, together with superb insights into the mind of a troubled but brilliant teenager. The interaction between Ross and Gyllenhall, for example, is reminiscent of some Oscar-winning scenes of old.",7,1,2,14 March 2005
