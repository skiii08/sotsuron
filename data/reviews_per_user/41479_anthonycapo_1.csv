Requiem for a Dream," powerful, stunning, and risky
","This film is perhaps the perfect modern tragedy.  Arnovsky takes some filmmaking risks that pay off beautifully in this intense, gut-wrenching tale.  Some really beautiful ensemble acting, and some wonderfully touching and even comic moments.  Everyone should see this film at least once. Squeamish viewers should muster up some bravery, because the message of this film is poignant and well worth the emotional Cyclone.",8,0,0,30 May 2001
