Conquest 1453," It's a bad movie
","I don't care about the absurd historic-political comments. Important; it's a bad movie, bad cast, bad script and bad technical background.. That's it. It' just wasting time, if you want to watch it. I personally expected a good movie, after too much advertisement in the media, but unfortunately can not write something nice about this Film. Disappointment. Many historical failures ; Sultan Mehmed II (Fatih) let pray his soldiers in front of City walls! This is just a fairy tale to build a strong religious feeling in the movie! Old Apachi style :)) Spending 17 Million Dollars for this Movie, does not mean: That's a good movie! Even that was the best box office in Turkey 2012, sorry to say it's a not successful production.",1,1,5,5 January 2013
