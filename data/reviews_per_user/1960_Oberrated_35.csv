10 Cloverfield Lane," Masterfully done thriller
","When 'Cloverfield' came out in 2008, I personally was not a fan at all. I hated the camera work, still hate T.J. Miller (Sorry not sorry), and overall I just did not understand it. However, after viewing '10 Cloverfield Lane' and seeing the (possible) connections to the first one; I now have a new-found appreciation for 'Cloverfield' as I have a love for '10 Cloverfield Lane'. So now where do I begin? We will start at the beginning. 1. The introduction of the title and the directors and producers was fantastically creative to me. All I will reveal for this part is that when the introductions are occurring, it is during the car crash scene as I previously explained in the summary. 2. The straight up unexpected turns and shocking moments keep happening throughout the entire film. As you think or witness one thing, another turn happens to alter the expected timeline every time. 3. John Goodman is eerily creepy, frightening, and fantastic all at the same time. There are moments where you want to love him, want to respect him, then want to see his brains splattered across the confined walls. Regardless, Goodman puts on a show in this one and is wildly effective in regards to the thriller element of this film. 4. and last point, '10 Cloverfield Lane' is a barrage of 'WTF' moments and curiosity but in the best way possible. Why is this happening? Who is Howard exactly? What is exactly happening? How much time has transpired since the events of 'Cloverfield'? '10 Cloverfield Lane' is playing curiosity perfectly by enticing crowds to take interest in the film and keep them wondering afterward and wanting more. I applaud Abrams and company and I personally am looking forward to the next installment desperately. They created an enticing sci-fi/thriller/mystery/drama all in one mysterious punch and I want more. Check this one out ASAP people if you loved the first Cloverfield or if you just simply love this style.EDIT To whom it may concern: Just to clear the waters, this installment IS NOT a direct sequel to 'Cloverfield'. It is the same universe but it is not a direct sequel. I stated that there may be possible connections. Regardless, it is a fantastic stand-alone film and I am anxious to see how things may tie together by the time Abrams is green-lit for another installment.",8,0,2,20 April 2016
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Slow starting --- Great action --- Boring leads --- Entertaining supporting characters
","'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' ultimately is black and white for me. As far as a final result and my reaction of the film as a whole, it was great entertainment and a lot of Star Wars fun. The action, once it started up, was fast-paced and constant. The effects were a, as expected, beautiful sight to see and also a lot of fun per usual. And lastly, the connection of this film to the Star Wars universe was very well done. So regardless of what I am about to say, Rogue One is definitely worth the view or two as it is a treat to see a new take, or at least, a more detailed take on events that happened within the Star Wars story line.Now for the bad: Even though it is entertaining, how bad can a Star Wars movie honestly be with all the previous ground work already laid out? This film was great when based off of the action, the Star Wars feel, and a story that is already so developed, it is easy to create something within it. Now what about performances? This film was great when no one was talking. The leads, Felicity Jones and Diego Luna, lacked charisma and presence while on screen. I felt no major connection to them nor did I feel I cared about them in the least bit. Easily, the more entertaining characters were within the performances of Alan Tudyk and Donnie Yen who played K-2SO and Chirrut ÃŽmwe. These two held attention and were loved characters for the personality that they brought to the screen. Not to mention, I am saying that a robot brought more personality than two humans... That is an issue to me... So beyond the two very weak main characters, the early first half portion of the film starts out very slow. For what may be the first thirty minutes, it is frequent location jumps and story development with little enticing moments leading up to what begins the fast-paced action that easily makes the movie worthwhile. Just to put the slow-paced start in perspective, I watched this movie once at a 10:30 PM showing on pre-release night and fell asleep. Yes, it is that slow.So, regardless of my negativity, the Star Wars fan in me was extremely satisfied with what I was given. The overall Star Wars feel of these movies will more than likely forever give me a satisfied feel when I reach the end of it but as I stated before, Disney would have to try very hard to fail when they have a tried and true formula already laid out before them. They are going to need to make new characters that can deliver powerful performances if they wish to come back to the status that Star Wars was at when 'A New Hope' and the original trilogy first came out.--Oberrated--",8,2,7,17 December 2016
Passengers," Another win for recent films within the Sci-Fi genre
","I happened to miss this film when it had its theatrical run in theaters but a friend recently brought my attention to it and I am happy he did.'Passengers' is fueled with impressive performances given the small cast consisting primarily of Chris Pratt, Jennifer Lawrence, Michael Sheen, and Lawrence Fishburne. While Pratt and Lawrence, once again, presented their strong range of skill within their acting expertise, Michael Sheen was a standout and very memorable to me. Regardless, everyone did such a strong job and kept me very immersed in an ever- changing complex story of survival given it was a small cast.As I said previously, the story, although seeming like a simple ABS story, changes frequently and throws a wide range of emotions at you throughout its entire run time. Every emotion from positive to negative, 'Passengers' is a film to remember.Definitely worth a watch.-- Oberrated.com --",8,1,3,21 March 2017
Moana," Beautiful animation and an all-around fun time brought to us by Disney.
","'Moana' was as fun and light-hearted as I could have wanted. A truly entertaining piece brought to us by Disney but who could have honestly expected anything different? Before getting into anything else, I have to first bring focus to how beautiful this movie is. The animation is so perfect and wonderfully done that I had moments where I forgot I was watching an animated film. From the models themselves, to the water effects, to the simplest motions. This was a truly beautiful movie to witness... 'Moana' also was very fluid and entertaining from start to finish. I never sat bored or felt rushed, it was a smooth and easy film to follow. Entertaining for the youngest of watchers to the most seasoned movie goer... Lastly, what is a Disney follow up movie to 'Frozen' without a little music? The singing pieces within this film was also a bunch of fun to experience. Although I can see other viewers getting annoyed or tired of the music but you come to expect that going into a Disney movie like 'Moana'. I personally enjoyed Dwayne's song 'You're Welcome' but of course, I am a bit biased when it comes to anything Dwayne.There is not much else I can say beyond what is already said. It is another animated Disney movie, but a brilliantly done one at that. 'Moana' is a film for all to love and is well deserving of all the kinds of praise it has been getting in recent weeks. Keep an eye out for this one in the future as well for the coming Oscars season.",8,2,13,6 December 2016
Suicide Squad," Average at best. Entertaining but problems production wise
","The Good: The film is entertaining, no doubt about it. The comedy hits well, for the most part, and the action is satisfying. The actors and actresses did well in their respective parts, some more shocking than others (i.e. Jai Courtney as Boomerang). While on the topic of characters, for me, Jared Leto as Joker was fantastic to me. Although he had very limited screen time, I was more than satisfied with his performance. He was weird and uncomfortable to watch and it worked for me. I feel that if he had a role in a feature length film as the villain, he would impress even more-so than he has done for some viewers. Another fantastic performance lies within Will Smith as Deadshot. While he easily steals the show, Deadshot/Will Smith commanded attention with almost every word and action. Lastly, among notable characters for me, Diablo/Jay Hernandez was great for me.The Bad: So while most of the good was within the performances and entertainment spectrum, a majority of the bad lies within production, writing, and overall the creative direction. The film was re-shot for more comedy to be inserted into the film. With this knowledge and now viewing the movie, the comedy that was present felt unnecessary at times. Many lines fell flat for me and could surely have been done without... A large amount of criticism with 'Suicide Squad' was about the amount of flashbacks seen. I would have to agree. Although some were most certainly entertaining, others felt pointless... The soundtrack created issues for me as well. Far too often were sequences flooded with mainstream music and not just one song, but followed up by another and even maybe another. A friend of mine, Shawn, said something which describes it perfectly as, 'It felt like watching a music video at times.' I believe in letting a film tell itself. Music far too often drowns out the moment you are watching in order to increase dramatics. 'Suicide Squad' fell victim to this concept... All in all, the film felt rushed. There are reports out there stating the production was rushed itself, so who knows. At the end of the day, while it was plenty of fun and it was entertaining with great performances; the underlying issues drown out sheer entertainment, especially with the direction DC is trying to pursue. 'Suicide Squad' is an 'alright' flick for me but better than 'Batman Vs. Superman', and that is a victory for me and my desire to enjoy a DC film.",6,1,5,8 August 2016
Doctor Strange," Effects to be wowed by. A compelling story. A character done right.
","'Doctor Strange', as I anticipated, met my expectations well. Marvel has forever done such a strong job at creating stories and investing ones at that. As an introduction film, 'Doctor Strange' ranks among the top for me, sitting only behind 'Iron Man' and 'Captain America: The First Avenger'. As I previously said, we witness a Marvel story that strays away from what we are used to. We are introduced to magic and spirit instead of genetically altered beings and high-tech suits... First and foremost, this was one of the most appealing-to-the-eye films Marvel has made. It is the best 3D movie I have ever watched in theaters and I would highly recommend to view in this format but of course, a standard viewing will satisfy as well. To my friends and myself, we each made reference to 'Inception', and 'Doctor Strange' surely gives off that feel, yet better. A wild trip for any viewer... I believe that Benedict Cumberbatch was made for this role. His suave charisma and witty intelligence carries the film with his every appearance on screen. Easily the star of the show, as if you would not have guessed that as is... From start to finish, 'Doctor Strange' was simply a wild and insanely appealing film to watch.Now, this part is for the viewers who want negative points on Marvel films and believe it or not, there are some. Within 'Doctor Strange' I found the comedy (which is something many anti-Marvel viewers criticize frequently) a bit too much at times. There would be moments where it felt unnecessary and could have just been done without. Regardless of being too much at times, the comedy was still funny and initiated a laugh out of me but I can not silence my opinion of thinking it could have been done without... The dialogue in moments seemed drawn out. Seconds could have been shed off if certain parts were not so dialogue heavy and the story just continued with a natural flow. Again though, not movie breaking, but minor moments existed where I noted it... I had a point where I found an issue, personally, with Steven's discovery of the awareness of Kamar-Taj. While this a spoiler if I were to delve deeper, if you wish to know, feel free to get in touch... Lastly, Miss Rachel McAdams. While I adore Rachel in most of her films, she just felt like an extra in this film. The unnecessary love interest that could have been done without and no one would have even realized she went missing. Might be just me, but you be the judge.Bottom line: Sorry for the long review, and I appreciate you if you have read this far in its entirety. Bottom line is that I highly recommend a view or two of 'Doctor Strange'. It is such a mind-blowing trip to view through its use of special effects. All actors and actresses bring their characters alive. It is fun entertainment for all kinds of viewers and is simply a show unlike any Marvel flick we are so used to.--Oberrated--",8,2,4,5 November 2016
Southpaw," Fantastic
","As the audience, this film does so well drawing us in and making us feel like we are living Billy's life. Without spoiling the events that happen, we experience his most dark moments when he is at rock bottom with next to nothing left. We experience every emotion possible from his tear-jerking sadness, to his fierce frustration, to his undeniable drive during his comeback. This movie is not just a sports movie. It is not just the next comeback boxing movie. It is a comeback in life movie. It is a movie that shows even when life is at its worst possible outcome. With enough drive, determination, and the fear of losing someone you love staring you right in the faceÂ… Any comeback is possible.",9,1,2,21 April 2016
Ant-Man," Nostalgic
","Ant-Man was a breath of old but new fresh air. To me it feels like a present day Marvel Universe, phase one movie. What I mean by that is it was an introduction movie like Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, and Thor alike, yet it was set in the present day of the Marvel Universe. So, post events of Age of Ultron. To me, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Paul Rudd played Scott Lange brilliantly, embodying the sarcastic joker that Ant-Man is known for yet still playing the role of a loving and caring father. The comedic point of this movie was on point where I found myself laughing at every line Scott would belt out and especially Michael PeÃ±a's character of Luis. Actually, the entire heist crew was an all around riot to witness on screen between Rudd, PeÃ±a, T.I. (Dave), and Dastmalchian (Kurt). Comedy aside, the action was just right for how I like my superhero movies. The effects were brilliant to me and this film was one of my favorite 3D movies to date. Overall, an enjoyable film as Marvel continues to knock movies out of the park and continues to make the inner comic geek in me so happy with characters I have grown to love and continue loving in their new present day adaptations.",8,0,3,21 April 2016
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," Not quite as bad as I was expecting, far from anything great
","So, again, I had zero expectations to enjoy this movie. I expected 87 minutes of dragging, over-the-top stupid humor, and ultimately a burning desire to see credits rolling, but to my pleasant surprise, I actually did not hate this movie. Now pump the brakes... I did not love it. It is not my underrated comedy of the year, it simply was better than I expected. When you see Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, and Jorma Taccone tagged to a film, you should already expect 'Saturday Night Live' satire and humor. 'Popstar: NSNS' simply was an SNL skit expanded to a feature film length, much like its previous successors when popular SNL skits were turned into films. The satire of the pop music world was clever and hilarious at moments and it definitely had those moments that made me laugh at how much the film tore apart notable pop stars in the music world. Now that is the extent of the positives for this flick. Once the film reaches its climax, it loses its steam and quickly becomes a snooze- fest. The comedy quickly reaches too far to pull laughter from its audiences, meanwhile I was already out the door.Again, not a total failure as I was anticipating it to be. It had its fair share of moments where it vultured a laugh or two out of me and the ever susceptible topic of pop culture and its superstars were ripe for the picking to create clever and relentless jokes of which I enjoyed. But nonetheless, it was a 50/50 movie with a teetering edge in the positive direction due to the satire comedy.",6,2,3,21 November 2016
The Revenant," IÃ±Ã¡rritu delivers again
","I will not sugar coat my opinion section for this movie. This film left me stunned, grinning from cheek to cheek as it ended. The cinematography is absolutely stunning. There are scenes when there is simply just a shot of clouds moving or trees swaying in the wind with just the sound of Hugh breathing happening and they are some of the most powerful yet simple moments I have ever seen. Leonardo puts on such a performance that some may even forget him as an actor and simply feel the struggle he is portraying as he grips onto survival. Tom Hardy puts on an absolutely stunning performance as well, further solidifying him having a remarkable 2015 year in film. Alejandro puts together yet another masterpiece in every aspect imaginable. There is not much more for me to say. I will have a spoiler section farther down in this article so if you have seen it, please feel free to scroll. Otherwise, I recommend everyone to see this film. Whether you are a casual entertainment fan or one of the biggest movie buffs, this film would grab everyone's attention and have them gasping for a breath at the intensity this film presents and how epic the project is in general.",9,0,3,21 April 2016
Split," Shyamalan has returned with the fire
","Just to reiterate, Shyamalan has not impressed me with his most recent works. I went into 'Split' very interested in the material presented in the trailer and especially with how McAvoy was going to approach a character with DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder), but regardless, I had very low expectations. Upon finishing my viewing of 'Split', I was incredibly impressed and satisfied with the film. Shyamalan (finally) delivered a film up to par with his classic works. I felt immersed in the story of 'Split', and that is strongly due to James McAvoy's performance, hands down. James plays a man with twenty-three different personalities. Within the film, we see him actively portray nine of them and some were even coexisting one after the other. It was simply astounding to witness him play this role. I truly felt I was watching a different actor each time until returning to the fact that this was still THE James McAvoy... Beyond the endless praise I could deliver for James, outshined but not to be forgotten, Anya Taylor-Joy remains to be one of my favorite newer actresses to hit the silver screen. Her character of Casey had a wide range of depth to her and was interesting to see develop... the story, as previously stated, is very well-done and immersive from start to finish... One only gripe I had with the film was that it seemed to lull for just a couple moments but it was hardly anything to alter my feel for the film.Shyamalan has come back with the fire. 'Split' is a sight to see and one I could watch over and over again. I hope to see Shyamalan continue this upward run and, as we have all come to expect and know of the director; lookout for a twist!-- Oberrated --",8,2,11,23 January 2017
Captain America: Civil War," Absolutely fantastic
","Marvel/Disney is a monstrous force in the film business with their superhero movies. They have set the bar so incredibly high that you almost can not compare these movies to other films because they simply trump the competition unless it is of their own brand. With that being said, 'Captain America: Civil War' met my predictions perfectly. I absolutely loved this film. Never before have we seen a superhero movie where so many of our beloved character are not only in the movie, they are fighting each other in all their super- powered glory and for longer than 5 minutes (Yes, I am looking at you BvS). The introduction of new faces were fantastic and even beyond the much anticipated arrival of Spider-man. Black Panther, Spider-man, Ant-Man, Scarlet Witch; all of their screen time felt natural and needed for the movie, as well as the returning faces we all know and love. The villain behind the scenes was great. All of his/her actions were methodical and evil and it was almost as if he was the puppeteer beyond the true Civil War going on. Beyond the plethora of pros this film had for me, I do have simply one comment for the cons. The humor did seem too much at times. Although hilarious at every moment, there were times where they could have done without it and simply let the action carry the movie on its own. Regardless, as I spoke of before... While most can critique this movie, when you put it up against other Marvel movies, it can be easy to say what was better or what was worse but when it comes down to Marvel vs. other typical movies: Marvel wins each time. 'Captain America: Civil War' will not disappoint. It is a movie for all viewers and of all ages. This is a must-see movie for 2016.",9,9,18,12 May 2016
The Conjuring 2," The horror movie of 2016 to watch
","In all honesty, I do not know where to begin with 'The Conjuring 2'. For people within the audience that has been following my reviews. You may be aware of myself not being a major fan of present-day horror movies, although I am desperately seeing most horror flicks that come out because I genuinely love the genre. I have been waiting patiently for a horror movie to truly frighten me and make me uncomfortable. With this title, I have finally found that. 'The Conjuring 2' was terrifying and near perfection at the same time. I even was brought to a point where a horror sequence almost made me want to walk out of the theater because I was so uncomfortable and uneasy with the events occurring on screen, Now do not forget, with that being said, it simply means that this was a horror film done right. There were multiple moments, still shots, and sequences that I feel will go down as iconic parts of horror movie history. James Wan will equally become a household name among horror movie fans as he is only continuing to push out impressive horror flicks time after time. 'The Conjuring 2' blew away the original to me and I am confident in saying that this could be THE horror movie of 2016, competitors being 'Don't Breathe' (Evil Dead remake team) and 'Lights Out' (Also directed by James Wan). If you want true terror and fast-paced horror, this is the movie to see. Again, in my opinion, this is the horror movie of 2016.",9,1,4,13 June 2016
Get Out," Simply excellent, Jordan Peele is something special.
","'...I take devilish glee in making people uncomfortable' - Jordan PeeleSir, you succeed. No room for sugar coating, as Jordan Peele did not do so in the slightest in 'Get Out'. This film may be one of my favorite films in the past decade and maybe ever. Again, one of my favorites, not all time favorite, calm down. This film was so brilliantly done from performance, to story, to the meaning behind it all, to the twists, just everything. I think what I truly loved about all of this is the originality behind it all. Jordan Peele wrote this and directed this. As it may have a few nods to past films (which, c'mon, what film does not take or at least nod to a past film?), it ultimately left me so satisfied to witness such a creative horror/thriller... Another thing this film did so brilliantly was keeping the audience curious until the very end. Although some things could be predicted, I personally still sat there thinking 'what in the f*$# is going on, what are these people doing?'. It is almost as if Jordan took his dark comedic skits from 'Key & Peele' and eliminated the comedy and let the dark vibe of it run wild... Lastly, the performances. Applause all around to everyone involved. I hope to see some of these actors and actresses in more projects in the future. I received a very strong Robin Lord Taylor (Oswald Cobblepot/Penguin in 'Gotham') vibe out of Caleb Landry Jones and could foresee him taking on more villainous roles in the future. Betty Gabriel has been a favorite of mine with her involvement in 'The Purge' films and seeing her involvement and performance in this film just reinforced that favoritism ten-fold. Daniel Kaluuya is a star-in-the-making, absolutely loved him in his main role. Last but not least, LilRel Howery stole the show. No matter how dark 'Get Out' got, LilRel's scenes are when the film takes a breath in the form of laugh-out-loud comedy. Brilliant performances all around.I had majorly high expectations for this film since I first saw a trailer for it and impressively they were exceeded. A horror flick from the mind of Jordan Peele. See this, folks, it is a good one.-- Oberrated.com --",9,9,28,25 February 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," Glad to be wrong. I thought this was going to be horrible. It wasn't!
","So, with the announcement of 'X-Men: Apocalypse' and coming off of the momentum that 'Days of Future Past' left me with... I was first extremely excited for this sequel. As time went on, announcements were made regarding casting and directions and as trailers were released, my excitement started to lose steam. As of yesterday before my screening of the film, I was prepared to rate this movie a 5/10 and was anticipating to be highly disappointed. I am more than happy to say I was extremely wrong. My early predictions had me hating what seemed to be Jennifer Lawrence/Mystique leading the X- Men. Upset at what seemed to be Xavier acting as a supporting role. Disappointed in the result of Apocalypse, and I probably had more negative anticipations that I can no longer remember. All of these early predictions were shot down. I enjoyed this film incredibly. From start to finish, I was locked in with every line, actions sequence, comedic relief, everything. I was satisfied with every actor/actress' performance INCLUDING Jennifer Lawrence, whom of which I have never been a major fan of with her portrayal of Mystique. Apocalypse was as bad-ass and powerful as I would have wanted and Oscar Isaac delivered. I am highly impressed at the way X-Men has handled their timeline altering and making it work well moving forward. And lastly, did you really think I would not mention my boy at least once? Wolverine's cameo (Hugh Jackman) was everything I hoped and dreamed for. There were small negative points and gripes I had with the film but nothing major to alter my overall response to the film as whole. I am happy to be proved wrong. 'X- Men: Apocalypse' was extremely entertaining and overall an excellent installment to the film series. I highly recommend a watch for the sleeper superhero movie of the year.",8,11,21,26 May 2016
Hidden Figures," Delightful and powerful from start to finish
","To answer my question brought about in the intro of this review, 'Hidden Figures' falls in the ranks of being a titan in its class. This film brings on an array of emotions throughout the duration of its run time. From delightful happiness, to laughter, to anger, and more. Overall though, it was a pure delight and feel-good film to witness and enjoy. The story is empowering to see what these three women overcame during their life and stopped at nothing to achieve what they set their minds to. For a dialogue heavy drama, I was impressed by how attention-grabbing the story of 'Hidden Figures' was. Usually, I have a tendency to lose focus on dramas but this film did such a great job at delivering a captivating performance of the story through the multitude of emotions it presented to the audience... The cast of 'Hidden Figures' all are such powerhouse performances during their respective screen time. Easily, my favorite was Taraji P. Henson, the 'star' of the film, so to speak, all though surrounded by other equally powerful actors and actresses. Alongside of her, Kevin Costner had a great performance and very memorable one on top of it for me. If there were any negatives I can truly put together for 'Hidden Figures', it may be that I feel Janelle MonÃ¡e's character was a bit underplayed with the screen-time given to Taraji's and Octavia's, but it was still an enjoyable performance to witness.A rightful film deserving of its 2017 Oscar nominations. 'Hidden Figures' is a delightful film to watch with a story that captivates its audience through an array of emotions. A highly recommended film from Oberrated.-- Oberrated.com --",9,15,32,26 January 2017
Mulholland Drive," David Lynch is a beautiful mad-man.
","'Mulholland Drive' goes beyond the conventional film. Mystery thrillers typically challenge their viewers but this one takes it way farther. As one timeline seems to become clear, another one is presented and causes viewers to attempt to piece what they knew previously into what they are newly learning. Not only is it a whole new set of events, it is a constant barrage of twists and turns. With this said, not only is this already a challenging concept, the first story already is strange and confusing to start. Adding in a new series of events only throws its audience another curve-ball. The film challenges its audience from the very start and demands to be thought of well after the film ends. David Lynch created a challenging piece of film in the form of 'Mulholland Drive' and good luck trying to figure his madness out during the film or even after the viewing is over.-- Oberrated --",8,0,0,5 June 2017
La La Land," As charming and delightful as it sounds. Near perfection
","As charming as can be, as creative as can be, nearly perfect as can be. 'La La Land', if musical films are of any interest to you, will demand to be watched from start to finish. Right from the start, the highway music number is an incredible watch. From production to performance, it is an absolute delight to and is simply the beginning for what 'La La Land' delivers for two hours.. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone take what is a two character performance and runs with it. The film rarely feels dull or boring as one or both of these two are on the screen no matter a spoken performance or musical number. The charisma and charm bleeds out of these two with every passing moment with a chemistry that is through the roof.. Damien Chazelle shows his love of music, and specifically Jazz, with yet another brilliant music-oriented film. First, he delivered us 'Whiplash', which remains to be one of my favorite films, and now we have 'La La Land', a film I did not expect to love AS much as I did due to it being a musical but Damien is simply a brilliant mind when it comes to these films. I am excited to see what he will continue to deliver to the public in the future.A special note to the true meaning to the film: That you never stop working for your dreams. No matter how many times you fail or are told 'No'. 'Here's to the fools who dream, foolish as they may seem.''La La Land' is an incredible piece of film. As I said before, I gained interest simply because I loved 'Whiplash' and what Damien Chazelle does with his films but I never expected to love a musical film as much as I did. With a phenomenal performance by the duo of Gosling and Stone as well as simply a near perfect production background. 'La La Land' deserves every award it gets as it faces off with film titans in each of its respective categories with the coming award shows.",9,2,10,10 January 2017
Don't Breathe," A thriller for the ages
","A wild ride from beginning to end. To start off, and nothing is revealed here, there are no good guys in this story. As witnessed in the trailers, we are watching three thieves and a man with a dark secret (via locked up girl in the basement seen in the trailer). As an audience, we get pulled in all kinds of directions to find a side to pick throughout the film and this was awesome for me... There are no brakes applied to the 'thriller' concept of this film. This one is intense and violent from the get go and it presents frequent 'wtf' moments over and over... Beyond the story and elements of the film, I have to give appreciation to the cinematography, score, and sound effects (or lack of). The film places the audience in a state of suspense with the way it goes completely silent and, at times, only allows the sound of light breathing come through the speakers. Creating an absolutely chilling experience.One of the best films of the year for me. Suspenseful and chilling from beginning to end. Highly recommended.--Oberrated--",8,6,15,25 August 2016
Beauty and the Beast," Another home-run for Disney's live-action re-imagining
","Disney continues to knock home-runs out of the park with their plan of re-imagining their animated classics and this time they have done so again with 'Beauty and the Beast'.Headed by the beauty herself, Emma Watson, the film has a star-studded cast of rising stars and legends of Hollywood. The entire cast does such a phenomenal job at each of their own respective characters. Making the audience fall in love with virtually every character on screen. Personally, I had a strong liking for Belle (Emma Watson), LumiÃ¨re (Ewan McGregor), and LeFou (Josh Gad).Visually, the film is beautiful and eye-popping. From the visuals of the live environment surrounding the castle or village to the animation involved in the music numbers. Everything was quite beautiful.My only gripe with any form of animation was with Beast. There has been criticism about his animation which I can half agree with. In some scenes, he was great and his animation wasn't distracting but in other scenes, his movement was choppy and evidently off.Ultimately, 'Beauty and the Beast' was a great live-action film. Disney continues to work its magic re-imagining their classics and continues to work their fool-proof formula.-- Oberrated.com --",8,2,7,4 April 2017
The Witch," Slowly terrifying and disturbing
","To put it simply, Robert Eggers delivers a terrorizing horror in the form of 'The Witch'. Do not go into this film expecting cheesy jump scares and scary apparitions. This one does not do that. Instead, 'The Witch' delivers a slow terror, unnerving, and mentally exhausting horror. The constant questioning of what is happening leaves the audience uneasy and when this film finally starts to pick up, it consistently bludgeons the audience with eerie terror. Some dislikes I did have, however, were that the old English is sometimes hard to follow and it can be found as being slow at some parts but it is all part of the style that Eggers is delivering his haunting moments. This is another Indie win for the creative horror category. I would place it among the ranks of last years creative beast that was 'It Follows'. Check this film out and try to keep your sanity.",8,2,7,21 April 2016
Kong: Skull Island," A superb spark to the Monsterverse
","'Kong: Skull Island' is great entertaining fun. The action is packed on and you can see that the backlash against the 2014 'Godzilla' was heard in regards to the minimal exposure to the monster and the lack of action until the very end. Kong is featured plenty in this film and the action, both human and monster, is constant and adrenaline inducing.All performers did great. To be honest, I didn't feel anyone was a standout performance but they were all notable and entertaining. If I could choose any standouts it would be John C. Reilly, Sam Jackson, and Tom Hiddleston, but again, they were nothing mind-blowing. All decent performances all-around.Lastly, the images produced by this film were stunning. I found myself sitting in my seat mouthing 'wow' on multiple occasions with what I was seeing unfold on screen. Most images of Kong were superb and the action sequences were incredible to watch. There was a terrifying beauty to every scene.Big recommendation here purely for how entertaining this action film was.-- Oberrated.com --",8,4,9,10 March 2017
Finding Dory," A rightful sequel to the childhood favorite
","'Finding Dory' hit home and satisfied the inner 11 year old in me that watched 'Finding Nemo'. Even with a recent watch of 'Finding Nemo', I was still incredibly invested in the original and just as much so in the new one. I also caught myself laughing and smiling like a child at parts right along with the kiddie crowd surrounding me (which was a large majority... I have no regrets). 'Finding Dory' was entertaining for a kids movie. Had enough humor to satisfy young and old alike. The voice actors and actresses were great. Of course, I had a slight issue with some majorly unrealistic aspects of the movie near the end but beggars can not be choosers. Regardless, at the end of the day, 'Finding Dory' is already a box office hit with it only being Friday and is destined for record-breaking success. I highly recommend 'Finding Dory' for all ages and consider it a 'must-see' for all audiences!",8,3,15,17 June 2016
Arrival," Let curiosity take control and enjoy this sci-fi masterpiece
","'Arrival' was truly a wild ride. Honestly, I feel this will be a film to be remembered within the genre for years to come. While some fans of the genre may feel that Sci-Fi films should be filled with alien blasting action or deep adventure, 'Arrival' thrives off of the desire to understand and an all-around curiosity for not only what an alien species could do if they were to interact with human civilization but what human nature could do given if this situation were to happen. As an audience member, I found myself curious as to what was going to happen next within the story from start to finish. Although moving at what could be seen as a slow pace, it had this creative 'edge-of-your-seat' feel to it as I anticipated anything to happen at any moment. If you are to view this film, I will warn you, curiosity and confusion can/will occur, but it only compliments the creativity within this film... Production wise, director Denis Villeneuve executes with suave perfection. With every passing moment, you can feel his influence in what he wanted each actor and actress to express with every movement and reaction. From as little as a simple gesture to the biggest line execution. A special nod goes to Bradford Young for the cinematography within this piece. There were scenes and moments within this films that looked utterly beautiful that blended so well with the vibe of the film. Leaving myself, personally, with stills and movie moments I will never forget as they were so interesting and creative to watch unfold.With the Sci-Fi Drama 'Arrival', expect curiosity to take over. It is a story to remember and debate/discuss with your friends for hours on end. A strong recommendation here from Oberrated and yet another worthy Oscar nomination.-- Oberrated.com --",9,1,8,29 January 2017
Wonder Woman," Finally!
","Finally, my eyes have seen a DC Extended Universe film that has truly blown me away. As I have stated in the past, I look at films from two different perspectives simultaneously as I watch them: One, from an entertainment perspective. Two, from a complete and whole film perspective, Oscar-worthy, if you will. While there is always a heavy debate about Oscars, no matter the opinion, 'Wonder Woman' entertained me from the very start to the very end. With an excellent blend of story, action, comedy, and so on, it truly has become one of my favorite superhero films. Gal Gadot hits a home-run playing WW. She owns this role and I truly hope there is a deep future for her in this role. The action thoroughly blew me away with the acceptance of some silly CG at times. I desperately hope Patty Jenkins will continue to have ties to the DC Universe because she led this film to greatness. As I sit and wonder where this ranks among comic book films; I can confidently say it sits among the top. Just under 'Logan' and resides among Marvel's best and clearly is the DC Extended Universe's best.-- Oberrated --",9,15,34,2 June 2017
Straight Outta Compton," Important
","Straight Outta Compton is a powerful movie in my opinion. N.W.A represented life as it happened in Compton but not only there, what is happening in life all over a nation. They represented the people who did not have a voice during the time of their come up. This film showed every important aspect as to why N.W.A. existed and how much talent these men really had/have. It was great to see the early stages of some of the most notable songs and sounds in hip-hop that is commonplace in many households. For N.W.A. it was more than just making music and getting popular. It was about putting music out that had purpose, their music meant something, meant something for someone. Gave mistreated individuals a voice. Whether you agree or disagree, that is obviously your choice but I can at least tell you; You will be the minority in this case.",9,2,27,21 April 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Great acting, Horrible material
","Oooooo, here we go. *claps and rubs hands together* I am sorry, this film was forgetful and pointless to me. There were too many misses in this entire two and a half hour drag-fest than hits for me to stay enveloped in this painfully over-done film. I do not know where to start so I am just going to begin listing them off so I apologize if this opinion section is all over the place... The first hour and a half was absolutely unmemorable. There was so much random information, random story-line jumps, and even some pointless pieces that had no reason to be shown and did not develop the story what- so-ever. The acting in this film... I am going to start with a pet peeve of the film; Senator Finch (Holly Hunter), she was absolutely laughable every time she was on screen. Speaking out the side of her mouth and delivering ridiculous lines. Probably my most-hated character in the film. Also in regard to the acting, I had no connection to any character at all. It was all just a straight shot through the film, this person speaks, that person speaks, you do not feel for anyone at all. I was not sitting in my seat cheering for this side, or pumping my fist for that side. I was sitting there in my seat pumping my fist for the end of the movie so I could head to bed. Speaking of bed, I did fall asleep for about fifteen minutes of the movie. It just was not pulling at all... The cameos: There are cameos in this film that to me were absolutely pointless. No spoilers, no reveals, I am just going to say they were pointless and horridly done... The reason for Batman and Superman to stop fighting; absolutely garbage. Again, no spoilers, but this might have been the most comedic part. More than Jesse's Lex/Joker/Donnie Thornberry performance... Alright, so I am going to stop here. All in all, there was just way too much trying to happen and not enough events to hit home and make this film a home-run. For some positives of the film, the brutality that was Batman was not bad. I also did not mind Ben Affleck as the Batman although he still is hardly memorable. Also in regards to Batman's brutality; the fight scenes (although minimal) were exciting. Honestly though, that was it. I do not have much praise for this film. It will probably be a split opinion in favor of and against but nonetheless, check it out for yourself but for me personally. Checkmate: Marvel Universe**Edit** As the summary says... Affleck, Gadot, and Cavill did absolutely phenomenal. Sadly enough, Snyder and company gave them terrible material to work with. With recent news of Affleck getting the green light for a solo Batman movie; I have high hopes for that which will be 20 times better than this work.",5,1,5,20 April 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Great for Star Wars fans.. 'Meh' for film fans
","So what did I think of the next chapter in Star Wars? To be honest, yes, the Star Wars geek in me was yelling in excitement on the inside. I actually did tear up a little when the scrolling credits started up. So as a fan, I loved it. It has been far too long that I have been wanting to know the next story but lets be critical shall we? I was not blown away by this film as many fans (including myself) was expecting to be. I found the story a little predictable at times and clichÃ©. I found the comedy within the movie far too Disney-esque. Something I would expect and welcome in a Marvel movie because that is what I love coming out of my favorite super heroes mouth's but Star Wars? Not so much. Also, as a Star Wars fan I was upset with the lack of light saber action. On the other end though, I enjoyed the action sequences as a whole. From the ground combat to the dogfights in the sky; Star Wars delivered and it was quite epic. The returning faces were great to see as well in their respective scenes. So again, as a whole the film brought the pain and I enjoyed the majority of it. I have waited a long time for this as a fan and it fulfilled the void in my heart for a good Star Wars film. I hope for the next installment that there is much more force and light sabers. So here's to waiting a couple years for the next one to come.",7,0,12,21 April 2016
Deadpool," Deadpool done right
","Ryan Reynolds, thank you. 'Deadpool' was everything I could hope for and love. The comedy is grade A for my taste. Every quip that Deadpool made had me laughing even in the midst of an action scene. Speaking of; the action was beautifully done and more than satisfying in terms of brutality and being epic. As much of a fan as I am of the Marvel PG- 13 movies, this is one of my favorites in regards to the pure realness of the interactions. I am a vulgar humor kind of guy and Deadpool just happens to be exactly that. Aside from the action and humor, the story line I felt was well done especially in the means of how it has phases of flashbacks and flash-forwards, all while Deadpool keeps the audience entertained by his direct interaction with the crowd as we all know and love him to do. A+ goes to Fox for knocking this out of the park or maybe A+ goes to Ryan Reynolds for pouring his heart into making this film happen for us, the fans, who wanted a real Deadpool film and not Baraka from Mortal Kombat. Catch this film, ladies and gentlemanÂ… Unless you do not like vulgar humor and blood and brutality andÂ… WellÂ… Just go see it, you will love it.",9,2,10,21 April 2016
John Wick: Chapter 2," Pulse-pounding non-stop action. Exactly what I wanted.
","I have heard many criticisms on 'John Wick: Chapter 2' in the time that it has been out. Most very positive, very few negative. Some criticism I heard was that this is the best action sequel that was seen in all time, that the action in this is unrivaled, or that this is some of the smartest gun-play presented in an action film, ever. Well that was other people, forget them, what about Oberrated? 'John Wick: Chapter 2' brought insane energy and picked up exactly where it left off from the first one. High-octane action, hilariously and purposefully short dialogue, and a plot that is simply fueled off of revenge and survival... The highlight of this film is without a doubt the action choreography that lasts almost quite literally, the entire duration of the film. My friend said himself and put quite well, 'Normally I sit and wait for action scenes to begin but with this, I am sitting here waiting for a dialogue piece to begin.' Yes my friends, there is that much action in this movie and I loved every moment of it... Honestly, there was very little I found a problem with in this film for the sheer fact I knew what I was getting into. It was an entertaining piece of action to be remembered just like the first one.There is nothing much else to say about it. This is a pulse-pounding action film for the ages. I am excited to see how this John Wick series is revered in the future but as for now, check this one out if you love non-stop violent action.-- Oberrated.com --",8,6,12,11 February 2017
Spectre," Not Skyfall but it's alright
","For those of you that are used to a more detailed summary of the movie from me, if you know James Bond, one does not simply break down a James Bond plot in a quick and easy paragraph. So, to save time, I explained the spark of the movie and the rest is a rubix cube from there. As for the review, 'Spectre' did not fail to impress. I have my critiques, however, but the movie overall was very attention-grabbing and entertaining. The acting is well executed by Daniel Craig and company, per usual. However, there were moments within the film where it felt like it was dragging and I grew tired, waiting for the next attention pulling scene. Speaking on moments though, I feel though that the great action moments and spy tricks that James Bond is known for far outweighs the slow moments that had me tired. Do I think 'Skyfall' is better than 'Spectre'? Yes, but 'Spectre' on its own was a great flick. Daniel Craig has done it again and 'Spectre' lived up to the hype for the most part.",7,0,6,21 April 2016
True Romance," A gift to entertainment
","Super satisfied to be directed to this movie and very upset I never took the time to view their earlier in my life. 'True Romance' is a treat from start to finish. Piling on an endless barrage of action, comedy, romance, mystery, suspense, and add any other element, this flick probably has it without ever feeling too much. The script very obviously projects Tarantino's influence, making this a treat to the Tarantino fans. The acting from everyone that appears on screen is excellent. If you have never seen this film before, you will see titans within the movie industry appear with such minor roles yet are so satisfying to see. The film as a whole is a fast-paced roller coaster ride, consistently entertaining the viewers with each moment that passes. The material within this film alone could fuel hundreds of other films. A truly fulfilling entertainment piece.A definite recommendation here from Oberrated and two thumbs up.--Oberrated--",9,9,12,14 November 2016
The Nice Guys," Just an average Joe
","Overall, I was disappointed by this film. I had such high hopes for 'The Nice Guys'. The trailers sold me, the actors and actresses had my attention. I was all-in for this but after my viewing of it; it was good and entertaining but it ultimately fell short of my expectations. Let us start with the good. Crowe and Gosling delivered. I digged their chemistry, they balanced each other out very well and the comedy hit well for me. I felt Gosling had the stronger performance and I was enjoying every scene with him in it. The 70's private investigator feel of the film was also enjoyable to me. Now for the negatives... Too drawn out. The film felt way longer than needed. To be honest, the characters of Jackson Healy and Holland March are not very developed besides being brutal yet comedic characters. The film tries to give the two characters a background story but it feels forced and forgetful. Bottom line: 'The Nice Guys' had incredible potential for me but it ended up falling short. Primarily due to the drawn out story and a lack of character development. Although still funny and pulling enough; just an average movie.",6,5,12,19 May 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," A rarity to ever take your eyes off the screen
","From start to finish, 'Hacksaw Ridge' practically demands attention. From the early phases of backstory and developing the 'who is Desmond Doss?' answer, to the 100 mile an hour action sequences. 'Hacksaw Ridge' leaves its audience in awe at what is occurring on screen, and as previously stated before; this is a film to see for the year... Andrew Garfield does such a phenomenal job at portraying the kind-hearted Desmond Doss. In an environment filled with rough and tough characters and an enemy with nothing but bad intentions, Garfield creates a loving and heart warming character that you can not help but smile at... The battle scenes were incredible. From the very start, my jaw was floored and I could not take my eyes off the screen. It was just a constant barrage of chaotic action. Quite possibly one of my favorite aspects of this film due to the sheer intensity of the action portrayed... Lastly, I was very impressed by how Mel Gibson and company took true accounts said by Desmond Doss himself and inputted them into the film. Without spoils, this was very pleasing to watch as it happened.I thoroughly think this may have some Oscar nods coming its way soon. Myself and some of my fellow film fans believe this too. One big recommendation by Oberrated to see 'Hacksaw Ridge' before it heads out of theaters and if not, definitely catch it upon its digital and physical copy release. From the director chair, to the artists in motions, to behind-the-scenes players, this whole product was quite the piece of entertainment.",9,2,7,17 November 2016
Me Before You," Unexpectedly funny yet heart-rending at the same time.
","I enjoyed 'Me Before You' much more than I had anticipated. I was originally interested upon its trailer release (and I mean, it is easy to sell me when you attach an Ed Sheeran song to the trailer, but that is besides the point.), but now that I have actually seen the film, I am more satisfied in the result of my viewing than expected and also very interested in reading the book series. To start, Sam and Emilia were excellent. I see a very strong transition from TV to film through Emilia Clarke. Especially going from playing a role like Daenerys from 'Game of Thrones' and even the strong personality role of Sarah Connor in 'Terminator Genisys' to the sort of ditsy, sarcastic, soft, and kind role of Lou Clark. Her character had me honestly laughing in multiple scenes as she had hilariously awkward interactions with some other characters on top of her constant sarcasm. Sam Claflin was nothing short of hilarious as well. His equally sarcastic character of Will Traynor was frequently sparking laughs among the crowd as well as his relentless strong personality that transitioned from his able-bodied self to his handicapped self. On a different note, the chemistry between the two worked very well. Nothing ever felt forced, in my opinion. Everything was smooth and easy-going. It was very entertaining to follow and the story as whole was something elegant yet heart- rending all the same. For a romantic-drama, I enjoyed this film very much so. I recommend this for all audiences as it is much more than the typical romantic feel-good movie.",8,4,6,8 June 2016
