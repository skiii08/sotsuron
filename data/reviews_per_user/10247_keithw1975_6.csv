Deja Vu," Surprisingly entertaining...
",After reading some of the reviews I went into the film not expecting too much. That may be why I liked it so much. The acting and the characters seemed natural and believable. Denzel was amazing as usual and the story kept me guessing. I didn't know exactly where the story was going since the previews I had seen didn't give everything away like they so often do these days.The time seemed to fly by and the whole idea seemed very believable and well done.SPOILER BELOW STOP HERE!!!!!!!! For the person that asked how he could be alive at the end you need to brush up on parallel universe theories. When he went back in time he went to another universe which had another Denzel in it.,8,1,2,25 November 2006
Cloverfield," Go see it.............
","After reading some of the bad reviews on here and in the news paper I was kinda worried that it wouldn't live up to my expectations. I was wrong! The movie was very well done and believable. The camera work made sure you saw the necessary things and didn't frustrate you like I was worried it would.The creature wasn't cheesy and I actually cared about the characters. The camera does jerk around some but it isn't a reason to avoid the movie and I found myself so engrossed in the story that I hardly even noticed it.Were there a lot of unanswered questions? Sure there were but not so many that you felt cheated, just enough to make you want more. To me this played into the believability of the whole 'this is a tape we found' part of the movie.",8,1,4,20 January 2008
Burn After Reading," Saw it Because it was a Coen Brothers film...
","We saw this movie thinking it would be pretty good but were disappointed. While No Country was just about ordinary people the characters were believable and well done. This film was just a bunch of ordinary, too ordinary, people who I didn't feel any real connection to. It was boring and just didn't go anywhere. This is a movie that is better caught on HBO some afternoon when it is cold out and you don't have anything better to do. Worth seeing but not something to look forward to. The best part of the film in my opinion was Malkovich's boss explaining things to his boss.Keith",5,5,9,14 September 2008
The Hills Have Eyes," Somewhat entertaining...
",You should only see this if you are bored and in the mood for some blood and guts horror. I found myself laughing and being mad at the characters more than anything else. The people seated behind me felt the same way listening to their comments during the movie. The son of a former detective at one point aims a loaded pistol at his brother-in-law and then he and the dad laugh about it because the safety was on!!!! Then in numerous other scenes they will use all their ammo shooting off into the desert only to have an empty gun when they need it. This is typical of many horror films in that it seems slapped together and makes you almost happy when the people are butchered because they are so stupid. A much better film in my opinion was Wolf Creek. It was a lot less Hollywooded and based on a true story.,3,0,2,12 March 2006
Avatar," Disappointed....
",I really had high hopes for this movie as I absolutely loved his previous films. This film had great special effects and good actors but the writing was pretty bland and unimaginative. It seemed like a rehash of Dances with Wolves with a little bit of Aliens thrown in. The premise and the lines were both cheesy and geared towards a kid. It really just seemed like they were out to make a quick buck without putting any effort into the story. Granted it will probably appeal to a very wide range of people meaning it will do great. I really had higher hopes though and was disappointed. The bad guys seemed very clich√©d and the people were pretty cut and dry. They were black and white as far as being good or bad and lacked the complexity of having shades of Grey.,5,4,13,19 December 2009
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," Really disappointing...
",I think JB can be pretty funny at times but this show was just sad. It wasn't even funny in a stupid/funny way. This is the first movie I can remember where I kept thinking about getting up and leaving. I wanted something funny and had decided on either this or Let's Go to Prison. Since the latter had gotten bad reviews on here and this had better ones I chose this waste of time. The funniest parts of the whole movie were Tim Robbins at one point and the part where bottles are smacking JB in the head.If you are thinking about seeing this wait until it is on sale at the video store for 99 cents about 3 months from now.Keith,3,0,10,26 November 2006
