Blade Runner 2049," What the visuals! What a beauty! What a masterpiece!!!
","The visuals of this movie are just amazing, I have never seen something so beautiful in a picture until now. What we see on the screen for 2 hours and 30 minutes is a mixture of perfect use of colours and lighting. Every setting is characterised by its own colours: settings which present cold colours (like the one at the beginning of the movie) and settings which present warm colours (like the radioactive setting where Agent K meets Deckard). The cinematography used in Blade Runner 2049 takes us back to the most recent Villeneuve's movies (Sicario, Arrival and Prisoners): slow camera movements and master shots which serve to highlight the importance of the character/s and the setting/s and to create the perfect thriller atmosphere. The imposing images that Villeneuve decide to show the audience are so beautiful that it's hard to feel the length of the movie even though it's quiet long, in average. The screenplay isn't complex and so is the story. The missing development of some characters is necessary since most of them are, in fact, replicants. I don't give it a 10 because, unfortunately, the story progresses too slowly and the villain is too little characterised. Best sequel of the history of cinema, even better than 'the empire strikes back'.",8,1,3,8 December 2017
It," This isn't a horror movie!!
","Good special effects and good use of soundtracks: especially in the first sequence which, alone, is worth the price of the ticket.HOWEVER! The editing is something terrible, mistakes over mistakes. Plot holes every twenty minutes. Why is Mike introduced after 5 minutes and then disappears from the screenplay for 1 hour or more? Plus, all the scary scenes generate from the same situations over and over again which makes them so predictable and irritable at the same time. Finally, I don't think this can be defined as a horror movie: there is no horror atmosphere at all. Muschietti's film is only made out of jump scares (predictable as well) and there are continuous mood swings that do not contribute to the (attempt of) creation of the terrifying atmosphere we are looking for. You can't make a horror movie only out of jump scares, it just doesn't work like that.",6,0,1,8 December 2017
Justice League," Entertaining, OK... but how confusing!!
","I love the dark and dramatic atmosphere of the DC Cinematic Universe and I loved the atmosphere that Snyder created before retiring. I also admit that the movie was entertaining enough.HOWEVER! The characterisation of most of the characters is just so wrong. First, Batman doesn't let the criminals go, I hope this is clear. Second, The Flash doesn't make retarded jokes, he is someone who believes in the cause and takes his job seriously. I hope he will be developed better in the next movies. Third, who's Aquaman? Cause after I left the screening, about his character, I knew as much as I knew before the movie. Fortunately, Wonder Woman is so hot that I can't really complain about her and Cyborg is actually the only one that I can save out of all of them. I really don't wanna say anything about Steppenwolf cause the para-demons are characterised more than him, in this movie. A few editing mistakes. Gigantic plot holes like the flowers that appear from nowhere towards the end of the picture and the 3/4 scenes dedicated to a completely useless Russian family who have the same function of Commissioner Gordon in this movie: No function at all. Justice League left me with no words at all, but luckily, I had zero expectations.",6,5,7,5 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Get along with the idea that this is a good movie!
","I really don't understand how some people dislike this movie. The only weaknesses I can think about are the characterisation of Finn, who is actually a useless character in this movie and the movie's length (the picture could last 20 minutes earlier).Guys, how can you complain about the screenplay? This is the the only Star Wars movie, after The Return Of The Jedi, which explains perfectly what the force is. In addition, the story is finally original and, like in Rogue One, we get the idea of real Star Wars. Freaking wars! What did you expect? Movies like The Revenge of The Sith? Some of you cherish George Lucas' films so much but you don't understand that those movies contained more plot holes then the most recent ones.
The cinematography surely takes us back to the first trilogy, why don't you say anything regarding that?
The themes that the movie develops (different themes from the usual ones of the previous trilogies) make sense and are explained correctly, also thanks to the role of certain characters in the picture.
Are you guys upset because Johnson tried to be a different director from Abrams and Lucas? Are you upset because he invented a story which is more complex than the simple ones you were used to?
Get along with the idea that this is meant to be a different trilogy. And get along with the fact that Johnson made a great job!",9,169,338,15 December 2017
