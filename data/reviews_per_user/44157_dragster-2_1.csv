Ghost," Very touching
","Congratulations to the director of this fine movie because he/she did a real fine job. In times when movies are all action and violence, Ghost tells us that there is hope for mankind...somewhere...somehow...it's not a religious thing and the movie doesn't try to push that either. There is more than one touching scene and the actors and actresses played their roles perfectly. Demi Moore fits in very well and you can see her liking the part all the way thru. Schwayze is fantastic too and is able to turn from the more 'violent' scenes to the mellow ones without any problems at all. The scenery of the movie is well-chosen too. More movies like Ghost should be shot every year!!",10,3,4,29 November 2006
