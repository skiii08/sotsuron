The Sound of Music," Using Sound of Music for teaching English
","I like using movies for teaching English in Asia. I show them as an adjunct to English class, so that students get an extended chance to hear English in use.The Sound of Music is too fast for my lower level students at the beginning of the year, but by the end of their first year, it's good. The accent is very clear, and the subtitles on the DVD are fairly accurate but not exact at all. However, since it is very long, it has to be shown in three to five sessions. If you try to show it in one long session your students will fall asleep. (Remember how difficult it is to listen for extended periods to a language that you struggle in). I didn't find an accurate script online so I downloaded one, corrected it roughly, and made a vocabulary list. I'm sure many English teachers would appreciate suggestions from other ESL teachers about how to use this movie for teaching English, or specific activities.",Null,1,7,15 July 2009
