The Blair Witch Project," 4 1/2 out of 5 stars
","I have seen a ton of scary movies ( Alien , Halloween , Friday the 13th , Nightmare on Elm Street , etc. ) But none of those films scared me more than the Blair Witch , this film is a masterpiece.The realistic feel of the film is probobly what did it for me , In the woods lost in October for days on end , I was waiting for Jason to jump out at them , But not this film , it deals with a myth , The Blair Witch , real or fake ?as the film progresses weird things begin to happen , and this leads to a very scary ending , My wife could not sleep that night.This film for me brought back what a scary movie is all about , REALISM , and I hope that Blair Witch 2 doesn't kill this series because they can take this series a long way .",Null,0,1,7 June 2000
Rocky V," 4 out of 5 stars
","Rocky V goes back to the basics of the Rocky Franchise.I enjoyed this film better than Rocky 3 and Rocky 4 , Having our champ come back to Philly where it all began was a treat , Sylvester Stallone again reprises his role as ROCKY , also returning are Talia Shire and Burt Young as Adrian and Paulie , also returning are Tony Burton and a special appearance by Burgess Meredith as Mickey , which I thought was the highlight of the film , Tommy Morrison makes his movie debut as Tommy Gunn a local boxer who Rocky takes under his wing .There has been talks recently with Sly Stallone to once again don the gloves for ROCKY VI , and something tells me that will happen ( it may help Sly's career ) .Make sure to pay special attention to the closing credits where you will see a video retro of the entire Rocky series , A must see for all Rocky Fans.",Null,5,7,8 June 2000
Rocky II," Second Best In Series
","I thought this film was very close to the original in being the best in the series , It was however un-recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences , so it did not win any awards , however I thought it should have .Sylvester Stallone is so perfect for this role as Rocky , and Talia Shire and Burt Young also excellent as Adrian and Pauly , I thought however the best acting was from Carl Weathers ( Apollo Creed ) , man you really grow to hate this guy through the film , I saw this film at least 50 times , And being from Philly myself , I also enjoyed the scenery . This is a top notch film which should not be missed   5 out of 5 Stars !!!!!",Null,0,0,2 June 2000

Rocky IV," 3 1/2 out of 5 stars
","Back in 1985 this film was very hyped by the media , and a huge budget was implemented for advertising Rocky IV .Did this film live up to all it's hype ?My personal opinion of Rocky IV was that this film had to be made ,( consider the time period USA vs RUSSIA ) , Sylvester Stallone returns as ROCKY , also returning are Talia Shire and Burt Young as Adrian and Paulie and Carl Weathers as Apollo , who decides to come out of retirement for one last fight with our newest and baddest foe Ivan Drago played superbly by Dolph Lundgren , the film itself was O.K. it was the shortest of the Rocky films at only 100 minutes , Their was no filming in Philadelphia which is synonoymus with Rocky films , and the acting wasn't all that great with the exception of Michael Pataki ( who plays Ivan's manager Nicoli ) , he did a superb job , man you really hated this guy in the film.On the plus side their was an EXCELLENT Soundtrack , the best of any Rocky Films , and the fight sequence with Rocky and Drago was one of the best in the series .If you are a Rocky fan , don't miss this film , I have seen it numerous times and still enjoy it .",Null,0,0,7 June 2000
Titanic," 5 out of 5 stars , Best film ever made to date !!!
","I have seen approx. 1000 films in my 35 yrs , I am a movie buff , I have a video collection of over 500 films , and never has their been a masterpiece made better than TITANIC.James Cameron has got to be so proud of this film he worked so hard on for so long , This film won 8 Academy Awards including Best Picture 1997.Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet gave great performances as well as every other actor and actress in this film.The Special Effects in this film were the best I have ever seen , The Soundtrack was wonderful .This is a film not to ever be missed .",Null,1,4,8 June 2000
Rocky III," 3 out of 5 Stars !!
","After the huge success of the first 2 Rocky Films , a third movie was inevitable .I was very anxious to see this film in 1982 , I remember waiting 3 hours for the theatre to open , This film was not a major dissapointment , however I feel it could have been better .Sylvester Stallone once again reprises his role as Rocky , in great fashion , Talia Shire and Burt Young return as Adrian and Paulie , Carl Weathers as Apollo , and MR. T as The well hated Clubber Lang who forces Rocky into a great fight , also returning are Tony Burton as Tony ( Apollo's Manager ) and of course Burgess Meredith as Mickey ( Who by the gives an excellent performance ) Also making a cameo in this film is Hulk Hogan as Thunderlips ( pre W.W.F. ) A Great Soundtrack also makes this film worth watching , If you are a Rocky fan , this is one film in the series you probobly can miss , but I have still seen it numerous times .",Null,0,0,6 June 2000
Kingpin," 5 Out Of 5 Stars !!!
","I am not a fan of Bowling Movies , however the Farelly Brothers have done a superb job with Kingpin , This movie is so funny I nearly fell off my chair watching it .Woody Harrelson plays Roy Munson , A very promising bowler in the 70s , As you see in the beginning of the film ) , he comes across Ernie Mc Kracken played superbly by Bill Murray , who talks him into betting on a bowling game , they win , however the guys that lose get pretty mad and decide to put Roy's right hand in the ball return , therefore cutting his hand off , Bowling Career Done ?Anyway 17 Years Passes , And Roy is now living in a run down apartment , selling condoms , and dodging his landlady , this leads to some very funny scenes , Than 1 day he meets Ishmail ( played by Randy Quaid ) who is a very promising bowler , and Roy wants to manage him , The story goes on from there , eventually meeting up with Claudia ( played by Vanessa Angel ) , this gives the film a sexual twist .I would highly recommend this film to anyone over 17 .Fox video has just recently released a Director's Cut of this film on Video , with bonus footage not to be missed , If you are a fan of the Farelly Brothers films ( DUMB & DUMBER  & There's Something About MARY , )  You don't want to miss this film !!!!",Null,0,0,31 May 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," 5 out of 5 stars !!!!
","This film ranks as one of my top 10 films of all time .Superb performances by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins , they cast this film wonderfully , From the crafty warden , to the prison guards , to all the inmates , And what a terrific ending to a superb film .This film was nominated for Best Picture but lost to Forrest Gump , had it not been for Gump , this film would have surely won Best Picture.I have watched this film 20 or so times and never get tired of it , No question it is the best Prison Film ever made ( Escape from Alcatraz close second ).",Null,0,0,8 June 2000
