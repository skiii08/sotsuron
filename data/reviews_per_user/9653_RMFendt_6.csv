Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Not quite as good as part #1, but close
","After watching the first part of this vengeful film duo, I had certain expectations from the second part. Imagine my face when I realized in the cinema that they were completely wrong. Part two is not 'just a continuation' of the first one. Anyone who expects it to be is going to be disappointed.After a few minutes of adaptation, however, I slowly fell in love with the second 'Bill', too. Its mood is totally different, the visual style, the pace. Which is, I am quite certain, exactly as Tarantino wanted it to be. In some ways, it is not quite Tarantino-ish. In others very much so. Like the loving details of each scene. The great camera work. And the master craftsmanship in general.So, how is this one different? It is slower. It is less violent. It gives the characters actual room for development. The music is totally different, too, which can mostly be credited to the fact that this is the first time a QT film has 'custom-made' music. Somehow it all works. Again.To sum it up: this is another masterpiece by QT. It is perhaps not quite as brilliant as the first half (that is always a risk with sequels), but it is a very close call. It is like the other side of a coin. Completely different, but still alike. If you can, invest the 4h and watch both parts in sequence. Only then you will experience the complete magic of 'Kill Bill'.",9,0,1,6 November 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," Worst of the three
","Well, after a brilliant start and a quite disappointing sequel, the third one could do one of two things: make it better, or make it worse. Make an impressive ending, putting the second part into perspective. Or make a cheesy, unimaginative ending, and let it all go down the gutter.Unfortunately, the Wachowski's did the latter. Oh, where to begin. With the first one being a quite intelligent film, and the second one just a dumb action flick, they actually managed to undercut 'Reloaded'. Oh yes sir, they did.This part is (again, alas) a simple 'good guys vs. bad guys' action flick. The 'heavily outnumbered heroes against certain end of humanity' aspect was strong, too, and emphasised just a bit too much. Nothing new here. In other words: I was bored. *Yawn*.The special effects: again nice, but nothing new, either. The whole thing is a seamless continuation of the second part. It looks and feels much the same. Someone clearly ran out of ideas here.The worst part of this film, however, is it's ending. It is cheesy. It is corny. It is boring. I sat there in the cinema, thinking 'What? That's *it*? Come on, you have to be f***ing kidding me here!'. The first part definitely did not deserve this. So not all that starts well ends well, too. Take my advice, and save your money. Don't buy it, don't rent it, don't watch it. You'll just be sorry.",4,0,0,17 November 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Breath-taking
","Okay, I will admit. I have been a big fan of Tarantino's works for a long time. So my expectations of this one were high indeed. And Tarantino delivers. It is hard, it is violent, it is fast. And expertly done, as always. And the musical accompaniment is, while somewhat peculiar, as with most QT films, of very high quality, and greatly helps setting the mood of the film.No one but QT could tell a simple tale of revenge that lasts over 4h (including part #2) without it becoming boring. Here we see that it can work, however: one simply never gets bored, not for one second. Call it Tarantino's magic. Visually: a feast; the actors: brilliant; the story-telling: gripping.So, is this 'instant classic' material? It certainly is. Is this one of the best movies Quentin ever did? Oh yes. Is it for any audience? Nope. But which Tarantino film (with the possible exception of Jackie Brown) ever was?",10,2,6,6 November 2005
The Matrix Reloaded," Mediocre
","After seeing the first installment of this series over and over again, my expectations where high indeed. That sequels can work and not be worse than their counterparts has been demonstrated by the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy and 'Kill Bill'. That sequels sometimes do not work at all, on the other side, is shown quite impressively by the 'Matrix' trilogy.Seriously, what were they thinking? 'Well, we are out of ideas, but the first one was a big box office success, so we simple *have* to do a sequel!'? Well, it has had to be something like this, otherwise I cannot understand why they released this pile of horse droppings.Okay, the special effects are again quite nice, although there are scenes where you can see quite clearly that it is all mainly CG. The 'wow' effect is gone, of course, and we do not see much that is genuinely new. So, from the 'eye candy' point of view, this sequel does not add much.Story-wise it is even worse. We see lots of new characters, mainly inside the Matrix. All this seems like a zoo of some sorts, because not one of these characters is actually important or unique. They are just bizarre, and form the setting for a string of (albeit impressive) action scenes.And this is what is left of the first 'Matrix': an uninteresting action flick. No philosophical reflexion, no unanswered questions anymore. Everything that made 'The Matrix' interesting has vanished here, being replaced by a simple 'good vs. bad' theme. And after a (too) long series of fight and flight sequences it simply... stops.Yes, the second and third part of the 'Matrix' should more likely be one long film rather than two separate installments. The ending of this part (if it can be called that) is quite unsatisfying: one simply is left hanging in thin air. Upshot: very disappointing.",5,0,1,17 November 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Surprisingly good - Spoilers
","After two high-quality movies, I feared the worst for this one. Being the conclusion of the series, it is perhaps the most difficult one to bring into the theater. My fears were unfounded, however: Jackson did a good job.Camera work is excellent, effects range from good to stunning-- and the narration also survives. If you accept that it is simply impossible to do an adaption of the books without changes, the changes Jackson did do become almost unimportant. The spirit is what's important-- and the spirit of the books survives once again. The actors also deliver (again) very good performance (with the notable exception of Wood: Pinocchio would have been a better actor than he), with Andy Serkins ('Gollum') being one of the best. I did not feel bored at all for most of the movie. Ok, the ending could have been a trifle shorter, but you can't have everything I guess.
One point of criticism survives: Jacksons almost-fatal love for too-solemn, slow-motion death (and pseudo-death) scenes. Frodo being stung by Kankra is simply a repetition of the cave troll scene in part one (with exactly the same facial expression Wood is so very good at...) and is the one point in the movie that was really, really boring and bad. In this respect, the scene falls in the same category as Aragorn's almost-death in part two. Well, thankfully 15 seconds cannot ruin over 3 hours of good movie. As I said, you cannot have everything.",9,0,0,18 December 2003
The Matrix," Brilliant
","When I first saw this movie, I was astonished. Ground-breaking special effects, the coolest theme you could imagine, great characters, a gripping story. Since then I have seen this movie several times, and never got bored of it.What makes Matrix work so well is not the hard rock/metal/industrial score, although this greatly helps establishing the overall mood. It is not the expertly-done camera work. It is not the breath-taking special effects and the perfect timing and general craftsmanship. All this helps, of course, but what makes Matrix so brilliant is that the story is actually creative. It raises philosophical questions, the most important one being 'what is reality?'. The actors do their part to make the story believable enough, so that one really does not want to this film to end, ever.Of course there are also goofs of some sort. The reason for the very existence of 'The Matrix' for example is quite silly, from a physical point of view. But somehow, this is completely unimportant when watching the film.What remains is a brilliant, expertly done piece of cinematographic work, a masterpiece. And then they blew it in the sequels, but that is another story.",9,0,1,17 November 2005
