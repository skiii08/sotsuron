Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Tarantino at his... worst?
","Considering how much i enjoy tarantino films... including Kill Bill vol. 1 - i was so very much looking forward to the release of vol. 2. Little did i realise that when Kill Bill was cut up into 2 volumes.... that it was literally cut up into 2 volumes. The first which offered a rich textured, comical and action packed experience was followed up with a 2nd half which is meant to be perhaps thought provoking.However it isnt pulled off well. Tarantino's ironic portrayal of the first movie is taken to a really bad extreme in the second film where not a lot happens, and then the film is wrapped up in about 10 minutes when Bill is confronted at last - and then dies in a matter of seconds with no sword fight, but instead a rediculous sequence of gestures....If you havent seen the film yet and are reading this review... you may probably think *wtf?* - well thats exactly what i thought when i saw the film. A gross disappointment considering the writer and the prequel.Thumbs Down",3,8,15,3 May 2004
The Butterfly Effect," Overhyped Trash
","Ashton Kutcher did to this film what Hayden Christensen did to Attack of The Clones. He turned a film which could have been decent into a pile of trash - yet another actor casted to swoon the young female audience irrespective of his talent as an actor.Again we see here a film with a good idea, and a screenplay that also could have been something more. But send whoever casted this film to the stocks - Ashton Kutcher... what were they thinking?Anyway, the film itself - i can imagine it wouldnt be too disappointing if the ad campaign that went with it was a bit smaller - but considering how much hype there was surrounding this film, it really was a disappointment. Compared to films such as donnie darko.... excuse me? Id compare it 10 things i hate about you - another film trying to sell an audience an hour and a half of eye candy with a plot somewhere in the background being torn apart by bad acting.By all means watch it.... but do not go watch it or buy the DVD thinking its an all time classic.",4,8,15,3 May 2004
