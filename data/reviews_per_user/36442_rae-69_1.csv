Kill Bill: Vol. 2," the disappointment
",i think for an average film director this film would have been a masterpiece but for a director such as Quinten Tarintino its a failure. in comparison to his earlier priceless films this was an embarrassment. the dialogue was poor and did not entirely pull you into their personalities and doesn't give you the belief that they could be real people where as Jackson and Travolta made you believe that they were real people because of the attention to detail in the dialogue. But as always the sound track was phenomenal! with good music you can always add style to a weak film scene! which I think Tarintino took advantage of in this case! The story line was poor and the only thing that fully engrossed me in this film is the well regrouped fight scenes! All though the cast was impressive the film was pieced together poorly and failed to tie in significantly there was just too much left unexplained of my liking! I have come to the conclusion that the film is extremely over-rated and was a disappointment to Tarintino's career!,5,3,6,9 October 2006
