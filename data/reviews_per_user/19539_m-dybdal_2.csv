",i have no clue why so many like this movie .. its insane SLOW and nothing happened and when something do happened they make it feel like ... nothing happened.. the actors is good but to call this a adventure or a sci-fi movie is a joke and a bad one ... this is a drama and a bad one at the top of it ... the story line feels flat like a pancake for close to 3 Danm hours ... I WANT MY MONEY AND THE 3 HOURES BACK GOD DANM IT !!! hated it .. and never gonna read any of IMDb's reviews again ...and why do i need to have 10 lines about crap i can say in one work ' CRAP ' yup that was insane hard -.- and what really pisses me off about this crap is that they call it a adventure / sci-fi ... 1 this movie is NOT a adventure at all .. 2 this movie is NOT a sci-fi at all and to even say that it is ... is bullshitt this movie is a crappy space drama and thats not the same as a sci-fi,1,7,15,17 March 2015
