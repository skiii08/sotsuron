The Blair Witch Project," Something in the woods...
","'The Blair Witch Project' 'In October of 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary called 'The Blair Witch Project'. A year later their footage was found.' That's the premise the filmmakers give the audience for this recent Sundance Film Festival rave.  You can think of this film as a horror 'This Is Spinal Tap', - completely fictional, but filmed in a way that suggests that what you are seeing really happened. Shot with a digital video camera and 16mm film, we watch as three young filmmakers get lost in the woods and bicker like a married couple from hell. I give first time directors Daniel Myrick and Edward Sanchez a ton of credit and respect for this creepy feature.  They create and execute the most searing horror film in some time. It's a truly original creation.  With more and more films itching toward the excess and pomp of the visual terror, 'Blair Witch' is purely psychological. We only see bits and pieces of what is terrorizing the trio and that is enough.  Any more would kill the illusion and ruin the suspense.  Trouble is, cut to 82 minutes from a 150 minute cut (even longer at one point), the movie oozes choppiness.  Jumping from moment to moment sours the spooky mood.  More scenes should have been left to linger. Instead, the film cuts around aimlessly.  When the picture truly hits a nerve - in the final 5 minutes - it makes the 77 that proceeded it seem pretty wasteful. Most of the film consists of watching the trio yell and agitate each other. Only a small amount of attention is played to the Blair Witch of the title. While being lost in endless woods with nothing to eat and no way of getting home is a pretty damn scary concept in itself, the film keeps reintroducing the supernatural element only to dismiss it for yet another puerile fight.  If this was truly a real incident, I would bet the farm that any news outlet who got their hands on this footage would squeeze the Blair Witch teat till it ran dry.  When the ending arrives, it only reminds you of the gaps in the storytelling that should have been fixed. Actors Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams do a sharp job as the cameraman and soundman of the group.  They successfully convey fear and anger, and they convincingly look like hell.  It's actress Heather Donahue that bothered me. Out of all three actors, Donahue feels the most false.  She's just too cinematic in her acting, often resorting to melodrama when the film begs the opposite.  This is a situation which invites a million different questions.  A perfectly acted film can make you forget the seams. Donahue's acting keeps you reminded that this is a fabricated film. While I did like 'Blair Witch', I fail to see what all the fuss is about. It's a wobbly horror flick that will spawn countless imitators upon release. It's a primitive film that reintroduces genuine scares to a genre that long ago forgot how to terrorize. It's a easily buzzable film that the cinematic community loves to hype because everybody feels that they discovered it.  It's a lot of things except the one thing that counts the most...  It isn't great. --------------- 7",Null,1,1,13 June 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Funnier, Faster, and Delicious
","When 'South Park' first appeared on the scene, I dismissed it without ever really watching it. I wasn't too interested in watching little kids yell and curse at each other. When 'Baseketball' opened last July, it was there and then that I began to understand the humor and musical styling of 'Park' creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Last year also saw the release of the duo's 'Orgazmo' and 'Cannibal : The Musical', both made prior to the 'South Park' phenomena. I became a fan. With 'South Park : Bigger, Longer, and Uncut', the television show makes the giant leap to the big screen with a completely over the top feature that will probably end up as the one summer film that gives the audience the most pop for it's coin. To synopsize the film would be too painful (and boring).  It's so packed with plot and characters that a one sentence generalization would do the film no justice.  I'll put it this way : If you don't know, get, or find 'South Park' funny, DON'T GO SEE THE FILM.  There might be droves of walkouts as soon as the opening sequence ends by people who thought that a cartoon could never be 'that bad'.  The R rating and the 'Uncut' of the title are there for a reason.  Heed the signs. Paced like a bat out of hell, 'South Park' is the funniest film to come around in some time.  While most of the jokes might seem stale to real 'Park' devotees, Director Parker knows exactly how to keep the film flowing, and in the process, show us new sides and characters that used to be unattainable on Comedy Central.  The movie is vulgar and offensive, that's the idea. But Parker and Stone never once get meanspirited about things, always making sure everybody get a slice of the laughingstock pie. The dreaded 'bleeping' of the curse words is finally gone, leaving Parker and Stone their first chance to show the world just how far they can take this concept.  After hostilities with the ratings board over the NC-17 given to 'Orgazmo'(which was harmless fun), this new film( which is far more raunchy than 'Orgazmo') can be easily viewed as one big middle finger to the ratings board.  It's the first film I have ever seen that purposely goes unbelievably far just to see what they can actually get away with.  It's very interesting to compare this film, which made it out with a R rating, to others that were slapped with the NC-17.  I believe that this is what Parker and Stone had in mind. Watching the antics of Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny on the silver screen does have it's advantages.  The film is decidedly cinematic, often jumping to show-stopping musical numbers that I love Parker for.  Working with Marc Shaiman, Parker brings us a whole new load of songs that are equal parts silly, and yet retain some musical respect.  A just world would find evil Canadians Terrence and Phillip's 'Uncle Fu**a' at the number one spot on the charts.  Like 'Cannibal', the songs stay in the head. They move beyond their comic foundation and feel like real songs, Parker has a musical gift and this 'South Park' feature really showcases it. But don't fret fans, the film is jammed packed with comedy that represents what 'South Park' is all about.  Canadians, African-Americans, Jews, Catholics, the poor, the wealthy, gay, straight, bi, men with voiceboxes, men with puppets on their hands... Everyone is made fun of here.  And every moment of this 80 minute film is comedic gold.  Like the 'Beavis And Butthead' film, this movie comes out just as people are beginning to write off the TV series.  And similar to 'Butthead', this film has made a true fan out of me.  No other flick this year will have the stamina, the audacity, and the sheer momentum to please like this little 'South Park' film.  I give Parker and Stone endless credit for crafting a film that nobody will expect, and that every fan will relish.--------- 9",Null,95,110,29 June 1999
The Mummy," Mummified Flick
","'The Mummy' Trust me, I'm not opposed to having fun with silly material.  I don't consider myself a dour person and I love a good 'bad' movie.  My take on 'The Mummy' is this : Expectations were high, and the filmmakers blew it. Set with a 80 million dollar budget and a distinctly stinky track record, how could I believe in my mind that director Stephen Sommers could pull this off?  The movie is a mess of really lame and desperate jokes, boisterous effects, and an unproved cast.  Brendan Fraser leads this journey with a pinch of Indiana Jones, a dash of Jerry Lewis, and a sprinkle of a Barry White baritone.  I don't like Mr. Fraiser, and his usual wooden performance doesn't suit the material. By trying to make him into the hero, the film succeeds in showing off even more of Mr. Fraser's limits. John Hannah makes for a passable lackey, and Rachel Weisz is delightful as the 'girl' of the film(I was already a fan). The two actors who really ooze mediocrity are Kevin J. O'Conner as the sniveling bad guy, and Arnold Vosloo as the title character.  While being a computer creation for most of the piece, Mr. Vosloo has to take over at the end of the film.Trouble is, he's not scary at all.  He resembles more of an aging lawyer who just flew back from Jamaica than a mummified agent from hell. The effects, which took up 1/4 of the budget, are in turns both impressive and depressing.  Using the computer to enhance a sky or to make 5 people 500... That's fantastic.  Using the same technology to create a noisy environment where each effect looks worse than the next is where I draw the line (Trust me, Spielberg was on to something when he used REAL insects in 'Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom'). All the CG stuff looks incredibly false to me, my kingdom for a guy in a rubber suit! Sommers has no tricks up the sleeve except to continuously bombard the senses with noise and predictable humor.  It could have been fun, it should have been great, what's left is the biggest letdown from a Hollywood production in some time.---------- 2",1,5,13,8 May 1999
10 Things I Hate About You," I 'Hate' this tripe
","'10 Things I Hate About You''Disturbing Behavior' director David Nutter complained loudly that his film was taken away from him and cut to shreds. MGM executives said that to appeal to the teen market the film had to be short and no shot should last more than 4 seconds. '10 Things' seems to come from this school of thinking. It's a miscalculated film that feels like it was trimmed quite a bit. Certain scenes are very slapdash, and the whole film seems to edited to make the littlest possible effect on the viewer. I was also not duped into finding it clever just because it's source material is Shakespeare. That's an idea that needs to go away for about 20 years. The reason it worked in 'Clueless' is because Amy Heckerling in a vastly talented director, not because of the gimmick.Leads Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger seem to be appropriately talented actors. They have a nice chemistry in this movie, and the best scenes are of when the two just stay still and talk. The rest of the actors are just a bore. Larry Miller plays his millionth role as himself, and it's still not funny. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is introduced as one of the main characters of the film, but without explanation is pushed aside, becoming a supporting player by movie's end. David Krumholtz showed a comedic spark in last year's 'Slums Of Beverly Hills', but saddled in this with lame sight gags, he cannot make an effect. The rest of the cast is predictably a Hollywood version of High School students.Director Gil Junger comes from a extensive TV background. You don't really need to have that information to see that '10 Things' is really just a glorified episode of 'Saved By The Bell'. Packed to the brim with a shockingly schizophrenic soundtrack that blasts a new tune every 30 seconds, this is another case of shameless self-promotion. I detested a lot of this movie. And I wished that it could have been more. But what I question the most is why this film is praised by some critics. I'm not opposed to having fun at the movies, but when it panders to the lowest common denominator, then I ask 'wassup wit dat?'------------ 1",Null,1,2,3 April 1999
Notting Hill," Up The 'Hill'
",">  After suffering a divorce, a marriage between a best friend and an ex-lover, not to mention living with a complete slob for a roommate, travel bookstore owner William (Hugh Grant) was just trying to live a peaceful existence in Notting Hill, England with his disastrous lovelife and a fledgling bookstore.  When American film megastar Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) comes in to browse for books about Turkey, the two sense a mutual attraction and begin a delicate love affair that threatens both their complicated lives.  The crux of 'Notting Hill' is this : can two exact opposites in the complex world of publicity and disposable relationships stay together forever? Screenwriter Richard Curtis's ('Four Weddings And A Funeral') goal this time around seems to be a sharp satire of the Hollywood starlets and their psychotic relationships with the public and themselves, and the old wacky English humour we've come to expect from any film with Mr. Grant.  It's a very odd mixture of the audience-pleasing easy comedy and something more sinister - possibly due to both lead's past public lives.  He creates two compelling characters in Anna and Garrett.  They both have very convincing motives for the courtship, it isn't just a roll in the hay and then the aftermath like most films.  Director Roger Michell keeps the flow nice and the two leads make good on their promise for charm and beauty. I'm a little irritated that so many would consider this a big step for Julia Roberts in the acting department.  She already gave a commanding performance in last year's 'Stepmom'.  With 'Hill', Roberts continues her impressive growth spurt into real adult acting and role choices.  Her work with Grant here is the most easy going I've even seen her do(Maybe one too many close-ups of that smile though...).  Hugh Grant does his stammering best to make William seem lovable.  I'm not a fan of Mr. Grant, but I will easily concede that this is his best performance to date.  Rhys Ifans is disgusting (a good thing) as Spike, William's flatmate.  He brings some very much needed brevity to the proceedings.  If anyone ever needs an actor to represent an English skuzzball, they should call this guy. If the charming 'Notting Hill' suffers from anything it might be the 'She's All That' syndrome.  Whenever you get the relationship ball rolling, it seems in everyone of these movies we need a forced situation to break up the two leads, just so we can cheer when they reconcile.  That's fine, no complaints.  In 'Hill', this syndrome is put to the extreme test.  We follow this romance through, I believe, at least three breakups.  That's too many for a two hour film.  We never get sure footing on to why these two should be together and that is a frustrating element.  Director Michell tries to hold onto the reins, but the climax of the film is forced and seriously uncharacteristic of the movie. 'Notting Hill' has a lot to say about fame and the effects of it on a life. It never bothers to take a stand or really explain if Roberts's character embraces her superstardom or is oppressed by it.  Screenwriter Curtis makes compelling arguments for both sides of the debate but strays away from truly looking deep within the fishbowl. When you think about it, William was a fan of Anna before meeting her, yet that subject seems too taboo for the film. What we get is just puppy love, no strings.'Notting Hill' is an extremely charming film with so much love to offer. It's a concoction that's hard to resist.  You'll come out of it with a warm fuzzy feeling in the tips of your toes.  It's nice to have a film that just wants to please, I just wish they didn't lay such a heavy topic wet blanket over the proceedings. --------------- 8",Null,37,50,29 May 1999
American Pie," None for me, please
","With 'Ten Things I Hate About You', 'She's All That', 'Idle Hands', 'Cruel Intentions', 'Carrie 2', and 'Never Been Kissed', I'm very tired of teenage movies with bad teenage actors trying to make disastrous teenage performances with lame teenage dialog and bad thirty year old directors. I'm up to my ears in this crap and it keeps making money. 'American Pie' isn't ground breaking material. In fact, out of all the examples above, this film is the best reason to fully examine why exactly this material is so beloved by the 17-21 year old film audience.Screenwriter Adam Herz and director Paul Weitz fashion 'American Pie' as this year's 'Porky's'. A movie about four high school seniors who vow to lose their virginity before prom. Each one will woo a fellow student to varying results, each will engage in completely unfunny comedic shenanigans that left my screening audience with tears in their eyes. I had a lump of coal in my stomach.It's rare to come across a comedy that on the outside has really nothing wrong with it. It tries to be funny. It's gross-out gags are appropriately gross (but damn them for outright stealing the laxative gag, so soon at least, from 'Dumb And Dumber'). It also features the grotesquely gratuitous nudity that I adore from a sex comedy. After 'Pie' was served, I was left with the feeling that the audience was had too easily. If this move would have been half as clever as it could have been, we would be witness to the biggest teenage comic gem since Ferris took the day off.The script is a loose concoction of distressingly elementary teenage drama intermixed with bawdy gags involving bodily secretions in beer, foreign exchange students (actress Shannon Elizabeth will be forgiven when she badmouths this performance in the future), self 'love', and the typical set-pieces that come around whenever a 'movie' keg is tapped. The entire film reeks of disrespect to females, but I will surely be creamed by everybody for bringing that up. I'll just leave my criticisms to the simple 'It's just isn't funny'. None of it. When Austin Powers drinks a cup of liquefied stool or the South Park kids swear without remorse, both films have plenty of ingenuity up their sleeves (in South Park's case, brilliant musical numbers). We can count on hysterical visual gags or rip-roaring lines to back up the questionable material. 'American Pie' can't do this. It isn't written with care or respect to the audience. Director Paul Weitz doesn't help the proceedings by making 'Pie' the most aesthetically bland film of the year. That's surprising considering 'Blair Witch Project' is shot with a camcorder and 'South Park' is a creation of construction paper and glue. It's a long shot, but some style might have made the bad medicine go down easier.The cast of 'American Pie' isn't anything to write home about. Chris Kline was memorable in April's 'Election' as the dimwitted jock with the heart of gold. Here he plays... the dimwitted jock with the heart of gold. Those scoring at home, scratch him off the list of ones to watch. Personal faves Natasha Lyonne and Tara Reid are asked to do nothing more that be the 'girls' of the film. If they needed the money badly, that would explain their presence. Both actresses have done better previously. Here's to the hope that they make rent this month and get back to films that exploit their respective talents more precision. Again I blame Paul Weitz's blasted direction. All that is expected of this cast is reaction and shock, not acting. Even comedy needs talented actors. That's why Eugene Levy ('SCTV') makes the only favorable impression here. He's a comedy legend and he doesn't have to break a sweat to make a joke click. The rest of the cast could learn a thing or two.'American Pie' is like catnip for teens. It's outrageous, it's naughty, and the boys are cute. There's always that feeling when I don't like a certain comedy that I didn't quite get it. I don't feel that here. 'Pie' is a bad film. A comedy that forgot the jokes and remembered the nonsense.---------------- 2",Null,0,0,11 July 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," A Bit Nearsighted
","'Eyes Wide Shut'Unfortunately, I am of the school where Stanley Kubrick is just another director. A man who makes movies like most other filmmakers around. Independent, free do do anything he likes, the 100 take man... What Stanley Kubrick has always represented to me is power and madness. A perfectionist who is beloved for a trait that any kingdom would crumble under. I've spent many years trying to like his work. I feel like an outsider. For his last film 'Eyes Wide Shut', I have the opportunity to see one of his pictures in the theater. That's something that has never happened before.Mr. Kubrick has chosen Tom Cruise to lead us this time. A ferociously gifted actor, he seems the natural choice to play Doctor Bill Harford, a man who's wife(a shockingly capable Nicole Kidman) reveals a secret desire for another man one night whiled stoned on marijuana. In a fit of jealous rage, the Doctor hits the streets of New York in search of his long hidden desires and wishes. What he finds startles him. A world of lust that he never really accepted in his private world. It turns him on and threatens his life at the same time. It's also a world he must confront to understand the bond of his marriage. I can sincerely say that this is Kubrick's most low key film ever.Being Cruise's story, we see everything from his angle of discovery and delight. I was amused by his scenes with a hooker (Vinessa Shaw) and a flirtatious hotel employee (Alan Cumming). I enjoyed most of the first half of the film. 'Sweet', I thought to myself, 'I finally like a Stanley Kubrick movie!'The one thing Kubrick does like no other director is to make his films glide effortlessly. 'Eyes Wide Shut' is probably the most well put together movie of the year. The production design is absolutely flawless. Each location that Cruise finds himself in is another chance to glimpse a well thought out world. The use of colors and film grain make a nice addition to the texture of the piece. Kubrick also prefers a stedicam glide through a scene than to cuts. Amen! The actors are better served with one-take shots instead of the usual chop-chop mentality. Technically, 'Eyes Wide Shut' is a marvel. The best looking Kubrick film out of the bunch.It is around the infamous 'orgy' scene that the seams start popping out of nowhere. The Doctor finds himself sneaking into a ritualistic orgy complete with high priest and absurdly staged 'sex'. It's the scene that climaxes the Doctor's story. Trouble is, when you look down at your watch, the film still has an hour to go. The orgy scene kills the movie on two levels. First being that - forgive me - it blows the film's wad. We get a full glimpse at the depravity and gluttony that the movie hinted at before(for the record, the digitally added figures that were added to cover nudity to avoid the NC-17 do hurt the scene greatly). Second thing is, since we have no idea what this orgy is about, it's hard to feel the danger that the Doctor is supposedly in. The movie works overtime to suggest that this moment has changed the Doctor forever. I never felt that. It came off as more of a goof than a life-threatening situation. And some orgy, about 10 people having sex while 400 look on. I've seen more bodies in heat in a July line outside the Old Country Buffet.Since the film has nowhere to go after this, we get an hour of forced intrigue and bad acting by Sydney Pollack. Now I want to stress that I did understand, get, comprehend 'Eyes Wide Shut'. It has many layers (the critics keep telling me this), and I'm not a true film lover if I cannot appreciate the film on it's deep emotional levels. But I can't. Kubrick's creation is visually dazzling but is far from pure cinematic brilliance. Other directors could take this material and make the same dead-weight film as well. The only thing that separates this from other movies is all the behind-the-scenes action. If Wes Anderson had his actors do 100 takes of a scene, who cares. But when Kubrick does this, IT'S GENIUS! His films are original. They just aren't all that good.'Eyes Wide Shut' is a cold, distant movie. A film that many will love, but many more will leave the theater wondering what to think. While with powerful moments, the final product is a very languid piece that will serve as the perfect example to what Stanley Kubrick could do with a million feet of celluloid.------------ 5",Null,0,1,17 July 1999
Detroit Rock City," Calling Dr. Love
","'Detroit Rock City'Darth Maul, Austin Powers, Tarzan, John Travolta, Julia Roberts, Cartman, James West, and killer sharks... What else would summer 1999 require? KISS. That's what we need. With all the teenager movies stinking up the multiplexes recently, the only relief is a film featuring the Knights In Satan's Service. Recalling 'Dazed And Confused' and channeling 'Rock N' Roll High School', 'Detroit Rock City' is a heaping portion of good fun. Filled to the brim with energy and acted by a cast of clever actors who probably can't even shave yet, this new music-packed comedy might just be what the doctor (Dr. Love, that is) ordered.KISS fans might not be too happy to hear that the band isn't in the film for more than 5 minutes. Director Adam Rifkin ('The Chase' and the pathetically forced 'Dark Backward') and writer Carl V. Dupre have made a film not about KISS, but about four teenagers from 1978 Cleveland who drive to Detroit to see the band in concert. Everything from religiously fanatic mothers (The great Lin Shaye), to money-stealing bullies, and even some Disco lowlifes try to stop our heroes as they trek to see the world's greatest band. Once in Detroit, the friends split up to find opportunities to scam their way into the show. It is also in Detroit where each teen learns a very important lesson about life, and just how much KISS rocks.Leading the group is Edward Furlong. Last seen in John Waters's 'Pecker', Furlong has opened up greatly in the past couple of films. In 'Detroit', Furlong gives his best performance to date. I've never seen him so loose on-screen before. Working with James DeBello, Giuseppe Andrews, and probably the most expressive teenage actor working today, Sam Huntington, they each deliver just the right amount of teenage apathy, yet make each one of their characters endearing to the audience. It's enormous fun to watch them on-screen together. You don't come around such a young cast that works so well together too often. Other players include the eternal vamp Shannon Tweed, Natasha Lyonne('Slums Of Beverly Hills') in yet another role that cannot seem to tap into her talents as much as I would like to see, and even a girl fittingly named Beth played by the wonderful Melanie Lynskey('Heavenly Creatures'),It's quite obvious from the brilliant opening credits that Director Rifkin is out to have some fun. He brings back the 1970's with wonderful widescreen lensing, a dab of split-screen, and a soundtrack crammed with classic rock hits. One after another, the music fills each scene with such vibrant energy. After getting so used to the pre-packaged soundtracks that frequently don't have anything to do with the movies that feature them, it's refreshing to see film and sound live in holy matrimony for once.The camera swings and moves with alarming speed. The colors pop and squeak. The era is evoked gently and without(much) sarcasm. 'Detroit Rock City' is one of the few films that seems to be the product of genuine love for the era and the music. It's a bright film with an enormous amount of good will. Whatever Rifkin has forced upon us before has now been forgotten.If I had to make once complaint about 'Detroit', it's the typical use of drama to justify the movie. You've seen it time and again, the film you love crashing to a halt so the lead character can make some death-to-the-ears speech about freedom, love, or any other mundane belief. It never ceases to stop any film, and it brings the kinetic 'Detroit' to it's knees for about 5 minutes. The picture is bright enough to not have to include any dramatic weight whatsoever. It's seems like a screenplay conceit, and probably is. Yet another film that's too self-conscious to really kick back and fire on all cylinders.New Line cut a great trailer for this film. The 'Mad' magazine-style poster was also a genius choice. 'Detroit Rock City' is silly and sometimes childish, but it never stoops to the constipated laughs of 'American Pie' or the plain ugliness of other similar 'boy' intensive teenage comedies. 'Detroit' is often sharp, always silly, slightly tasteless, but a seriously rocking late summer film that makes up for the usual garbage that litters August. You wanted the best, you got the best.--------- 9/10",Null,28,32,29 July 1999
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," A 'Barrel' of monkeys is preferred...
","`Lock, Stock, And Two Smoking Barrels' Guy Ritchie's debut film is perfect for people who don't see many movies, or are incredibly jaded about the current non-originality of 1999 Hollywood. But I see too many films, and I crave clichés.You could say that this film was simply not for me.  When people bring up a Quentin Tarantino influence to gangster films, I cringe and feel sick to my stomach.  It's a lazy way to summarize the current crime genre, and it doesn't do many of the films justice. `Lock, Stock' goes one further by actually delivering solid proof that it steals from Tarantino.  The filmmakers might call it a `homage', but this isn't Neptune.  Most of us can see right through that.  I was dismayed at the film's attempt at coolness.  With boring camerawork and a stillborn soundtrack, this film is a good example of what first time filmmakers should not do.  Ritchie plays by all the rules.  His cast is an eclectic group of Londoners, none of which you can remember when the lights go up.  It's story is a rather predictable mix of double-crosses and botched shootouts, and I applaud (sarcastically) on the director's use of what seemed like 32 endings. To consider this original work is insanity.  `Lock, Stock' thrills a lot of people, from what I've read.  I am hard pressed to fully understand why.-------------- 1",Null,0,0,21 March 1999
The Iron Giant," Disney can bite me
","'The Iron Giant''Tarzan' brought Disney animation back to working order this summer with it's rich animation, terrific narrative songs, and a specific attention to what made the previous Disney blunders fail both critically and financially. 'Tarzan' still played by the tired Disney rules, but they are learning. With Warner Brothers animation, they seem to be taking more risks with their own product. From the cross-promotion antics of the lively 'Space Jam' to the noble failure of 'Quest For Camelot', The WB has been fighting mightily to grab the animation crown of recognition that sits rusted on top of mount Disney. With 'Iron Giant', Bugs and company jump miles ahead of any cartoon competition (except for the 'South Park' feature) to create a timeless, and nearly flawless, animated feature. You just know you're in good hands when director Brad Bird's past credits include a stint as a writer-director on the genius animated show 'The Simpsons'. That show often goes out of it's way to parody Disney animation and others of it's ilk. Bird knows exactly what trappings to avoid and what emotional buttons to push. It is this knowledge in the end that makes 'Giant' so effective. The story, based on a children's novel entitled 'The Iron Man', is set in 1957, just as the cold war was getting warm. Hogarth Hughes is a precocious 10 year-old boy with big dreams trapped in a paranoid society in deep fear of the Red Menace. His single mother (voiced with honey by Jennifer Aniston, who's name is misspelled in the end credits) works long hours to pay the bills, and Hogarth is often left alone and lonely. When an iron robot crash lands on Earth one stormy night, Hogarth discovers the Giant and quickly befriends the dazed and confused robot. Soon after, a government agent (another sneaky Christopher McDonald acting job) learns of the Giant's appearance and sets out to destroy the Giant without ever truly understanding that the robot means no harm. One of the first things that director Bird gets just perfectly is the tone and color of 1950's America. Now, we've seen this period time and again in movies, just not this accurate. The threat of Russian invasion hangs in the air like an old sock. The kids watch 'duck and cover' reels in school. The government, having been burned by Sputnik, experiences the itchiest trigger finger know to man. All the 'Leave It To Beaver' type material is represented in this film as well, but for a movie aimed at 10 year-olds? Warner Brothers and Brad Bird deserve much credit for keeping this cartoon more cerebral than any in recent history. This is one good script and story, told with zest and intelligence. I also applaud the simple notion of keeping the Giant's origins a mystery. We never know where the Giant came from or what it's purpose in the grand scheme of things inevitably is. With every film wasting time spelling things out for the audience, 'Iron Giant' asks you to just use your imagination. What a notion.Using period pastels and detailed architecture, it is the look of this animated feature that truly thrilled me. So used to current Disney animation am I that to see a cartoon in the widescreen format literally makes me weep (even if it ends up being the lame Super 35 format). 'Giant' easily is the best looking cartoon to come around in decades. It looks like they spent 3 years on each shot. Bird and crew create a unique looking film that seems to be born of the comics and the animation itself of the day. With five o'clock shadows on the men, deliriously wrinkled faces of the aged, and the scary waistlines of the women, 'Giant' is spot-on with it's drawings. I could watch the film time and again just for the animation. It makes up for some iffy drama that occupies the film's 2nd act.To see a film like 'Inspector Gadget', with it's relentless delivery and shameless corporate plugs(I know 'Giant' will have a merchandising landslide, but the film never feels like a 90 minute toy commercial), make a killing at the box office, it's imperative that a film like 'Iron Giant' be known. We need more story-centric cartoons like this. I'm embarrassed to admit that I felt an outpouring of emotion at the end of the film. It's rare to get an animated feature that engages the crowd with lovable characters without being so calculated. It's even more rare to get an animated film that has no songs to drown the narrative. 'Iron Giant' is told clean and true. The bittersweet climax (reminiscent of the traumatizing 'Fox And The Hound') left me thrilled with 'Iron Giant' even more. This is one good animated film that should finally put Warner Brothers on the map. I strongly recommend it. --------------- 9/10",Null,0,0,3 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," One Willis away from greatness...
","'The Sixth Sense'When Bruce Willis decides to act, it's an important occasion. When slogging through misfires like 'Mercury Rising' and pure junk like 'Armageddon', Willis never gets a chance to show the more dramatic side to his personality. 'Sixth Sense' is the first product of the new Willis-no-guns philosophy that Bruce recently has made public. While it aspires to be 'The Exorcist' for 1999, 'Sixth Sense' can only muster the atmosphere of an off episode of 'X-Files'. A downright incomprehensible thriller that is too concerned with mood to care about the laughable story.The real star of the picture is young Haley Joel Osmet (the easy bio is to say Forrest Jr. in 'Forrest Gump'). He plays a young boy named Cole who has the ability to see the dead. The life-challenged repeatedly harass and torture him to a point when the entire world the surrounds Cole views him as a freak. While his mother (gifted Toni Collett) cannot understand the secrets Cole keeps, a child psychiatrist (Willis) finds himself drawn to help the young child. The two set out to crack the mystery of why Cole is the chosen one.Written and directed by first-timer M. Night Shyamalan, the film has all the trappings of a debut movie. It's careful with every detail, visually flat, and has trouble sustaining interest throughout. What the film does just right is creating some creepy moments. Moments that could have forced the film to take a more disturbing note, thereby making the movie memorable. What Shyamalan does is punctuate each heightened situation with a orchestral bang or any other Dolby scare tactic used by every modern film to grab a scare. I keep wondering why directors do this. Sure, it gets a jolt out of the audience, but it's an easy one that isn't earned. A real horror film shouldn't have to lower itself to get a fright out of the audience. In the end, 'Dolby scares' do more harm than good. 'Sixth Sense' had the goods to really disrupt the audience, instead it hits all the same notes.Bruce Willis swearing off action films might be the worst mistake Willis has made. His best work has been in this genre (the 'Die Hard' series) and giving it up leaves him with a plethora of father and psychiatrist roles to play for the rest of his career. We meet a kinder, gentler Willis in 'Sixth Sense'. It's a performance that isn't among the actor's best, yet is far from an embarrassment. Willis plays his character rather muted, never once opening up for the big emotions. You could say that was his character, but I suggest that Willis just doesn't know how to play anyone who doesn't have an urgent situation to take care of. I love Willis, but 'Sixth Sense' doesn't require much from the actor except pursed lips and a really obnoxious hairpiece. Ten year old Haley Joel Osment, on the other hand, has a remarkable depth and range for a child his age. It is his acting that grounds 'Sense' emotionally. I enjoyed his work here very much, and a simple scene of mother and son bonding in a shopping cart clearly showed the chemistry Osment shared with on-screen mom Collett.A victim of crass Disney mismarketing, 'Sixth Sense' isn't really much more than a light thriller with demonic overtones. Shyamalan's script often goes on wild tangents. Scenes with Willis and his wife (shockingly unused Olivia Williams, seen last in 'Rushmore') that are supposed to pay off at the end of the picture are left wide open for questions dealing with simple logic. Another moment in which Osment helps a little dead girl to justice seems from a different movie. The entire film appears to make little sense, yet to question what you're watching is obviously not the point. Shamalyan's script is also without dialog, just characters delivering speeches to each other. It's all tiring after an hour or so.Like this summer's 'Arlington Road', the entire film hinges on a last minute plot twist. A twist that is supposed to knock you off your feet. While I was surprised by the ending, it's such an illogical and implausible plot turn that it's hard not to laugh at it. Coming out of the film I was disappointed in the PG-13 'Sense'. The next film to try this plot (Scorsese's next, 'Bringing Out The Dead', features a similar idea) should just try to take the material more seriously, give it a chance to creep us out instead of forcing it. 'Sixth Sense' is just another forgettable thriller.---------- 3",Null,0,0,7 August 1999
The Matrix," Be on the lookout for this stunner
","'The Matrix' The trailers and commercials tease you with fleeting shots of flying action scenes and nefarious G-men in black sunglasses.The soundtrack pumps electronica as our leather bound heroes try to save the day.  You ask yourself, 'What is the Matrix?'...Man, I wish I could tell you that.  After 130 minutes of this new action film, I was completely baffled.  What I do know is that notorious directors Andy and Larry Wachowski have crafted this decade's 'Blade Runner'.  A sci-fi thriller that will blow away movie-geeks and stun everybody else. In 1997's 'Bound', the Wachowski brothers burst onto the scene with a complex and bloody thriller that took many people by surprise due to it's high tech sheen and sharp performances.  Armed with 80 million dollars and creative control from Village Roadshow, the Brothers bring their typical manic energy to this piece as well.  The end result being big time entertainment. The stars of the film do a good job making sure to wear their faces at disbelief at all times.  Keanu Reeves will never top his career-defining performance in 'Point Break', but this film gives him a great opportunity to show off his hero face. A face that the actor wears so very well.  Laurence Fishburne brings his typical ego-driven self to the role.  He enunciates carefully and is never without a smirk.  It's a graceful performance. It's the two relatively new actors that got my attention.  Carrie-Anne Moss brings a disarming toughness to her acting.  You really believe that she could take out an entire group of armed men.  But it's Hugo Weaving as the bad guy that really takes the acting honors.  By choosing to use his voice over typical braun, Weaving makes for a very menacing villain.And only the Wachowski Brothers know what to do with Joe Pantoliano.  Here, like in 'Bound', he makes his role all his own. Many in the screening that I attended were shocked at the complexity of the film's action sequences.  I couldn't help but feel a weird case of deja-vu(especially the tired 'Time Slice' effect).Steven Norrington practically reinvented the hand to hand fight scene in his overrated 'Blade'. Every time a punch was thrown in that film, the effects would show the guy being thrown across the room. In 'The Matrix', the action feels oddly similar.  Seeing the two back to back would make for a very interesting double feature.  Like 'Bound' though, the Wachowski Brothers just cannot stage a action scene without the whole moment feeling ice cold.  You begin to watch 'cool' shots instead of a truly kinetic action sequence.  I couldn't help but roll my eyes during most of the climax.  The computer effects are wonderfully done, practically seamless.  But they have been done before, leaving the highly original plot to 'The Matrix' feeling stale in the end. I try not to seem to jaded, because I did love the movie's complete unabashed free fall into a world you cannot understand in one viewing. The film is 99% expostition and 1% payoff. That is one, of many, gifts the Wachowski Brothers have.  They can spin a yarn like no other.  Whether or not the public takes to this remains to be seen.  But if I know film-geeks at all, I can tell you right now that this picture will have a long shelf life for years to come.----------- 9",Null,1,2,25 March 1999
Tarzan," Mmmmmmm... Apey.
","Animated Disney films always seem to be the same in hindsight.  It's only when the directors get the inclination to try something bigger that the films achieve a legendary status.  It's been ten years since this new Disney renaissance began with 'The Little Mermaid', the new 'Tarzan' represents exactly what is wrong and what is so very right with the Mouse House's approach to the animated features.During these last ten years, the studio has learned what's worked, and what doesn't.  Disney always plays it safe.  The 'Tarzan' opening is very similar to the mega-successful 'The Lion King'.  They compress the entire backstory into a 10 minute opening, and it works like a charm.  We all have to admit that Phil Collins hasn't done anything substantial in the last ten years as well, yet his songs for this new film are spot on.  They narrate the film and guide the audience perfectly through this loose adaptation of the Edgar Rice Burroughs novel.  Having been weaned on poor character songs throughout the years, it's deliciously blasphemous to not have to sit through 5 or 6 god awful musical numbers that even the composers don't seem to like.  It brings an unexpected freshness to this well-known material. With 'Tarzan', Disney is taking on a character and story that has gone through countless adaptations.  This animated approach seems to fit just right. By not having to rely on a physically impressive (but poorly expressive) actor, the animators have created the most believable Tarzan yet.  He glides through the jungle with ease, dragging behind his the well worn knuckles of an ape-man.  It's probably one of Disney's most impressive creations, even though it is one so renowned.  Tony Goldwyn brings the voice of Tarzan to life with unexpected sweetness.  While used sparingly, Goldwyn manages to capture the character with ease.  I also enjoyed Minnie Driver's spunky voice for Jane, making her the most palatable animated heroine since Lady.  Rosie O'Donnell is about as grating as you might suspect and Glenn Close is perfect as Tarzan's ape mother. It's the villain that Disney needs to work on.  While watching 'Tarzan' you can easily feel that the addition of the bad guy is superfluous.  He's just there because the filmmakers think we can't go without it.  They're dead wrong.  The flick is filled with lush visuals (courtesy of the more prominent GCI work), grand music, and a strong story. We don't need forced conflict.  The conflict within is what 'Tarzan' is all about. The rogue brings the film down more than it should. Coming out of 'Tarzan' I had feelings I haven't felt from a Disney production in some time.  I was moved by the material, shockingly filled with emotion. I came out of the theater humming the music, not an easy thing in the years of 'Mulan' and 'Hunchback'.  I also came out impressed that Disney might be making baby steps to a new and brighter future of animated films.  I look forward to it. ------------ 7",Null,25,38,29 May 1999
The Thin Red Line," Sorry, I can't justify incoherent rambling
","Sometimes when you try to reach the stars, you realize how low the floor is...`The Thin Red Line' It's hard to really put into words how odd this film is. It would help if the film knew what it was.  A three hour `inner child' meditation set during the taking of ONE hill during World War 2.  It's easy to say the battle scenes are exciting, they're battle scenes...  that's what they're there for.  But the rest of the film is painfully slow and mortifyingly tedious.  Some may call it art, some might be entranced - I was p****d.  I feel really sorry for Sean Peen, John C. Reilly, George Clooney, Nick Stahl, and scores of other actors who's parts were severely trimmed to one line cameos. Those `star' actors are nice to have, with Malick's unprofessional attention to character, it's all we get to tell who's from who.  To sacrifice great acting in favor of nature shots and aimless voice-overs is a real shame. The movie forgoes plot A B C thinking in favor of just rambling along.  I'm not looking for rigid structure here, just a nice flaky pie crust of form would have been nice.  Malick should have had a leash on this one.  This film looks and feels like the work of an insane man.  Only Elias Koteas, Ben Chaplin and Jim Caviezel register strongly - and only because Malick amazingly left their back story in the final film.  I do like the Stedicam glides that are used liberally, and who can say anything bad about the location? Gorgeous.  I get the sinking feeling that the critics who praise this film don't want to look bad in front of their peers.  Tough to sit through, and even tougher to understand.",Null,1,2,16 January 1999
