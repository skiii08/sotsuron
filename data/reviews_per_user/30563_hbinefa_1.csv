Casablanca," My all time favorite
","I have seen this movie literally hundreds of times and I never get tired nor bored of it.All the actors are incredible and absolutely all the scenes are memorable.I just love all the different relationships between the main characters. I wish I could feel what I felt the first time I saw the movie (I was 15). My parents were so happy that I loved that movie that they started recommending me other great classic movies they loved as well (Lawrence of Arabia, Gilda, All About Eve, His Girl Friday...)Thanks God to the classics because I have lost faith with the actual cinema.P.S. My daughter's name is, of course, Ilsa! :))",10,1,2,30 July 2013
