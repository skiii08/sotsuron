Skyfall," Plot Stinks
","There is a lot else wrong with this 'Bond' film as other reviews have well pointed out but I will focus on the overall flaw.The main problem is the basic plot itself.Look, if a single disgruntled ex-employee of MI6 can cause this much havoc, destruction, and mayhem while bringing the spy organization to its symbolic knees, then what does that say about MI6? That they are pretty incompetent fools who deserve what they get? Yep! By the end of this film I was rooting for the bad guys because if they are that good at outsmarting MI6 then I want to be on their side.The plot was stupid and insulting to every fan of the 'Bond' universe.I didn't like QoS much either but at least it was recognizable in the Bond world, which Skyfall is not.",1,22,45,14 November 2012
Constantine," See it if you like the genre.
","Depending on how you view the subject matter and films based on comic books, this is either a movie you will love or hate. I've seen it twice already so you know where I stand. I thought the special effects were well done and the dialog to be above par for this type of movie (comic book). As for the acting, there are some very good performances which have been mentioned in other comments. However, regarding Keanu Reeves, I think that there must be some sort of hate club out there that has no other goal in mind other than to denigrate his acting. Granted he is not of the Robert DeNiro school of acting. Keanu is Keanu much the same as John Wayne was always John Wayne, Eastwood is always Eastwood, etc etc. And that is fine if you like his screen persona. I do, and I think he plays the title role with the right amount of sarcasm, fatigue, and a world weariness that comes across just fine. For those who continue to hammer on his performances, well everyone to his or her own opinion. He is of the stoic acting school and that is just as legitimate as the over-the-top-emoting school that you see from most actors nowadays. As I said in the beginning, if you like the subject matter (hell, damnation, demons, angels, etc) and like movies that are based on comic books (impossible yet engaging) and aren't a Keanu hater, then you will probably enjoy this film. PS there is also some very good chemistry between Keanu and Rachel Weisz.",8,12,30,27 February 2005
Watchmen," Two Kinds of People
","There appear to be two kinds of people: those who love this film and those who hate it with a passion. I am in the former group. That said, I do think that the film could have been better and that it has one flaw: the ending.Let me state, I have not read the graphic novel so my views are based solely on what is on the screen.The ending is basically this: the world's smartest man, and the world's only indestructible man who can transport himself anywhere in the universe and can alter matter at will, can think of only one way to save the world from nuclear destruction...by the mass murder of some 15 million people. That's it? That's the best these two near gods can come up with? How about this....let's see, the indestructible guy tele-transports himself all over the world to wherever there are nuclear weapons, missiles, etc. and then turns them all into ice cream cones. How about that? And the world's smartest guy actually uses his brains to communicate with 'the people' and convince them that Nixon and others are leading the country to the brink of destruction. How about that? I mean if I take these two characters at face value, then the ending presented is absurd.As I said in the beginning, I love this movie. It holds my attention all the way through. I love the two main characters who 'find one another' and wind up as a couple. But the ending sucks. I still give it 10 for 10 because it is so much better than most of the crap being made these days.As for those who really really hate this movie I think I understand...the movies you like I would probably hate...people have different tastes, nothing wrong (or right) about that.",10,3,9,21 May 2010
The Revenant," Not Much to See, Not Much to Miss
","Pros: Great scenery. A list actors (DiCaprio, Hardy, others). Did I mention Great Scenery?Cons: Story ripped off from Man in the Wilderness. No plot other than a man crawling through the snow for 2 hours. Unbelievable action (floating down an icy cold river in winter without freezing or hypothermia setting in). Starting fires without an effort in winter with everything wet or covered with snow. No plot other than a man crawling through the snow for 2 hours (did I already mention that?). CGI bear. Boring, anti-climatic predictable ending (not worth the wait). No emotional connection with the main character because there is no character development. Lots and lots of snow. Sophomoric dialogue. Cartoonish characters. Lots and lots of snow.To sum up in one word: Pretentious (look it up like I did)Will undoubtedly win lots and lots of Oscars...",3,18,36,13 January 2016
National Treasure," So-So
","Not a really good movie. Not a really bad movie. Has some entertaining moments, but very generic and cliché'd. No surprises. Lightweight stuff. Okay to pass the time if you want to see a flick, just don't expect much and you won't be disappointed. Cage is himself, if you know what I mean. Diane Kruger is pleasing on the eyes, but doesn't have much of a part. Kind of a poor mans Indiana Jones picture. If you like Cage, you will be entertained, at times. But you might also be checking your watch. I did.I gave the film 6 of 10.The editor keeps asking for at least 10 lines to post a comment. By my count I've got more than 12 but it still wants more. So here is a bunch of useless footnotes that don't mean squat.",6,0,0,22 November 2004
Arrival," Wait for the DVD to come out and then don't buy it.
",You can read other reviews for details of the plot and characters. I'll simply say that it was as many have said very very boring.The special effects don't really seem very special when you consider all the truly great SciFi films of recent years.Jeremy Renner was absolutely wasted in a role that is so underwritten as to be nonexistent.And plot holes!!! Oh My God!!! There are so many things that make absolutely no sense...and other things that are basically insulting to any thinking human being. Again these have been detailed in many other reviews and I will not repeat them.,3,3,10,19 November 2016
Cinderella Man," Good Film, not Great
","Cinderella Man is a good film but not a great one. Crowe is his usual excellent self in a role that would be a mere cliché with a lessor actor, however all the other roles are just that. The film is enjoyable on a strictly feel good level, which is fine, but because its aim is so obviously manipulative (ie I expected Dickens' Tiny Tim on crutches to show up at any moment) it becomes very formulaic and entirely predictable. Nothing wrong with that however, just nothing special. It is definitely worth seeing for Crowe's performance and the excellent set decoration, but it is not one of the top ten movies of 2005....at least I hope not.",5,2,7,7 June 2005
