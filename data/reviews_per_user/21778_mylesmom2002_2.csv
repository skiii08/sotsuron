Catch Me If You Can," Great!!!!
",I loved this movie. The story catches you and holds you until the very end. Tom Hanks is great as usual. The fact that it is a true story really makes it interesting. You really get involved with what's going in. I highly recommend it.,10,0,1,17 January 2003
Gangs of New York," The worst!!!!!!!!!
",I can't believe this picture has been nominated for Best Picture of the year. This was the most depressing and agonizing 2 1/2 hours I had ever spent watching a movie. It was hard to follow and even harder to get into the characters. Don't waste your time!!!!,1,12,29,17 January 2003
