Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Harmless Fun
","Borat is outrageous, and when you see this you think Sasha Baron Cohen must be out of his mind too. In fact, he's just very brave. The man knew what he wanted to do and he went all the way. Bravo! The funniest jokes are always the ones that contain some not-so-funny truths and this comedy is a great example: mentalities that are frightening to us liberals are mainstream in some parts of this country. Personally I most enjoy when it is patriotism that comes under attack, and I doubt I'm misinterpreting Borat when I say he tries to show the ugliness and immorality of the concept of patriotism. To those who are offended because this burlesque masterpiece could be misconstrued as a negative portrait of the people of Kazakhstan, I say you're wrong if you even consider taking home any information about that culture. I knew nothing about Kazakhstan before I saw this movie and I still know nothing now. This movie is about America and people who hate homosexuals and Jews but love Jesus and the flag.",10,2,17,6 November 2006
