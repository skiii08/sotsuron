Sucker Punch," Awesomely Entertaining
","Wow! Nice movie to actually kick off the 2011 year, because previous films can't compare to how incredible this one was. What I'm having hard time to believe is, that meta-critic rated this film so low. Who's rating these films these days anyways, do they have no compassion for good movies. Or are they only rating films high, that satisfy their age? Because I'm guessing who ever is the critics, they're probably old, and not into to much action packed entertainment. No offense to these old hags, but they need to learn they're are young people that would want to see this movie Sucker Punch. But they'll see your review, and won't be interested.9/10 *** 1/2--Aidar.

Troy," Make more
","Wolfgang Peterson(Director) done a outstanding job, of how it would have looked like, during the Trojan War. Achilles(Brad Pitt) was fearless, and one of the greatest fighter for the Greeks. The movie does a good job showing the view of characters and not the gods.It all started with Helen(Diane Kruger) leaving with Paris(Orlando Bloom) to be together in Troy. Menelaus the king of Sparta, ordered an attack on Troy.There were many great fight scenes, but the best one was, Achilles and Hector(Eric Bana). The graphics were amazing and a worth watch, not because it was written by Homer(poem writter) because it had good story line and wasn't waste of time.--A.Haynes--",8,1,4,22 January 2010
Terminator Salvation," Reliving the past
","Reliving the Past is one of the things about this movie, that made me think of how it compared with the old ones.I would say it had the non-stop action, and part of it was, because they spent 200 million on the movie budget. the quilty of the movie was great.It started in the year 2019, fifthteen years after the Marcus Wright signing the papers, for donating his body to the Government. I can't tell you the whole story, but i wanna say something, that you might wanna hear, here it goes: Did the Humans have something to do with the Terminators, like did they build them, then screwed up, then now there trying clean up there mistake, by killing them and telling lies, i was just wondering.",9,2,4,3 June 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Great Finish or is it?
","Pirate of the Carribbean:At World's End, has made a big impact for Walt Disney. One of the movies you'll have to watch over and over again.At the end of the second movie of pirates. I thought that Jack(Johnny Depp) wasn't meant to die, by getting swallowed by a monster. But I knew, at end of movie, they had to make a trilogy. And happens to be so.The third is packed with action. Jack is trapped in Davey Jones Locker. Barbossa(Geoffrey Rush),Will Turner(Orlando Bloom), and Elizabeth(Keira Knightley) heads towards the direction of Jack. During there voyage, they came down a huge waterfall, with their ship wrecked. Jack licks a rock, that transforms into a crab, then the crab kept producing more, and then moved Jack's ship on to shore. There he meets Barbossa and the others. It takes him a while to pick the pirates, he wants aboard, because three of them tried to kill him in the past. But makes a deal and they all set to shore to meet the 9 lords to unleash Calypso, to help them fight Davy Jones, and Lord Beckett.The end is for you to watch, and reveal yourself.--A.Haynes--",9,0,3,15 December 2009
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Another Great Movie
","Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows: Part 1, showed the story accurately from book, written by J.K. Rowling. It truly is a Epic Finale. With everyone showing great performance. If you grew with the films, from the start. Then you know whats happening. But the thing that bothered me, was the slow pace, during certain points. It followed the book, but I just wanted more Magic and Action. We'll Probably Get that from the 2 part.It was sad to Hedwig and Dobby to Die. It left a hole in the Heart. It was a dark film. The Effects were great as usually. I would see the movie if I were you!Overall I'd rate it 8.5/10.--A.Haynes--",8,0,2,20 November 2010
Wanted," 8.5/10 Great Action Movie
","The movie Wanted starts out with anticipating action. The action you just knew the movie would have, with it's breath taking special effects, Wanted could not get any better than this.Wesley Gibson(James McAvoy) is a accounting manager, with a anorexic boss, that makes Wesley's everyday life miserable. Wesley seems to not care about anything these days, his dad took off when he was seven days old. Then found out that his dad was a professional assassin, greatest ever to live and got murdered at the Metropolitan Building.Fox(Angelina Jolie) trains Wesley, to get revenge,for his father's murder. In his training, he has to accomplish different tasks. Many of the tasks are impossible, unless Wesley choose his fate, to challenge the impossible.Sloan(Morgan Freeman) is in command of Fraternity, the Fraternity describe themselves as weapons of fate. They are assassins with purpose to maintain stability in a unstable world, to 'kill one, save a thousand'.Wesley is finally is prepared for his enemy, and isn't going to show any mercy. Watch, to unfold secrets, that you never would of thought. The movie gets your adrenaline going, and at the end, it's gonna make you wanting more.If you watched this movie or about to watch it, keep in mind there making a sequel.--A.Haynes--",8,2,7,14 December 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," 8.5/10
","First I'm going to start off with that the movie had great special effects. Comparing it with the first movie (Transformers 2007), It did a well job on keeping me entertained, with many explosions, fight scenes, and (Megan Fox) moments. The thing that surprised me was, or kept me wondering, was the scene jumps. Many people don't care about this much or don't notice it. For an a example, When Sam was running from the Decepticons in Egypt, he jumped away from a missile and landed face down. Then a second later, out of Nowhere, He was on his feet running, like nothing happened. This bothers me, I know they need to cut out scenes to make the movie shorter. But the director (Michael Bay) could have done better job on this kind of mistake. This movie isn't a reality, but at-lest make it reasonable.Otherwise the movie was just great (8.5). The story line makes clear sense, it's not like the 'Da Vinci Code', where it's hard to follow up on. In the beginning of the movie The 'Fallen' have been here before our lifetime (21st century), and have tried to destroy the earth. But the Primes stopped them from the destruction or extinction of the human race. After many years of hiding, the Fallen have came back for revenge, They bring back Megatron to life to help them, on a mission they once failed. Many funny scenes in this movie. The parents of Sam, are funnier than the last one. Every character played a role to make the movie feel like it deserved to be a sequel. For instance the military soldiers, Major Lennox(Josh Duhamel) and Master Sergeant (Tyrese Gibson) made humorous lines.Overall the movie, has found a place in my movie collection. My rank for this out of my 5,000 list: # 1,888",8,18,32,18 February 2010
The Blind Side," Just Watch
","Watching Blind Side was heartwarming. A feeling you usually don't get, when you experience this kind of movie, It's a feeling, which gives joy. The reason I had this feeling wasn't because it was about football,and the love family gave to Michael Oher, But it was the fact that it was true story, This movie isn't a white-wash, I saw many different races watching this film, so don't think only white-Americans watch this film, many others do. So please take yourself out or your family and enjoy The Blind Side.If your not into football, it won't matter, because it's more than football, and you can see that for yourself.--A. Haynes--",9,0,2,22 January 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," 10/10 a movie you'll have to watch again, and again
","Peter Jackson's 'The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy is a Legendary Masterpiece. It's one of best Epic Fantasy of our time. Many actors and actresses made this movie possible, possibly only Elijah Wood could play 'Frodo Baggins'.The Return Of The King begins with Gollum's past, shows how Gollum endured with the ring. Then goes to the present of the Frodo and Sam on their Journey to the fires of Mount Doom. The main plot of the movie was that Suaron is determined to wipe-out the human-race, But only the King of Gondor can stop him.There is no point of telling more, if you haven't seen 3rd Movie, then your just missing out on the greatest movies of our time.",10,0,3,14 December 2009
Click," Adam Sandler movie
","The movie Click gives good message to the parent's. The message is, that family comes first, and Adam Sandler playing Michael Newman, has done a good job giving the point of the movie, with humor involved.But I've been reading other comments, and one that strikes me, was when a person writes a review, he usually has a pretty good sense of the movie, but copy's, or puts in a well known ed sentence. I'm not saying how someone should write a review, but what I'm saying is that you need to interest the reader, and don't say, 'the movie was like a trailer, the whole hour', or some other time.I know that you might give the reader of how the movie was, and put in that sentence, but you could also, write your own style of the movie. But let me say my portion of the movie. This was made in 2006, and I had say it, did well on special effects. Truly, the movie had many laughing scenes. But the effects took its place first.I highly recommend this as a family movie, there isn't anything that will offend your family. Sure it has some language, but sometimes it is needed for Adam Sandler movies.--A.Haynes--",9,1,2,15 December 2009
The Godfather," Another one would be Great...
","If there is any classical movie out there, it would be, The Godfather. The Godfather showed how a movie should be, if it had family,business, and mobs.Vito Corleone is the Godfather, his family quote is, 'Do you spend time with your family?...because If a man douesn't spend time with his family, then he isn't a real man.', that gave the audience, of how much the Godfather cares for his family.In the movie Al Pacino plays as Michael, his brothers call him, Micky or Mick. He plays a important role in the movie. His dad the Godfather dies, and he takes over the family business. There are 5 family mobs in New York, that the Corleone's are at war. Michael shoots a police officer and Sollozzo, they were in a Itailin Restuarent and Michael asked for permission to goto the restroom. In the restroom he gets what he needs to exterminate the two enemies, that were giving the Corleone Family trouble.After that, he traveled to Sicily for a year or more. There he found a wife to marry, but it didn't take to long to find Michael. They set a bomb in their car, which killed Michael's wife.The movie showed, great acting, and having it at the right time and mood. This movie is a masterpiece.If your in the mood for something delightful and enjoying, then you have yourself a movie. --A.Haynes--",10,0,1,22 January 2010
