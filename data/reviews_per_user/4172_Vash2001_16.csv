United 93," An honest and powerful film
","I was deeply touched by United 93. I had already read the reviews before I saw the film and that may have diluted the experience just a bit. Still it was an emotional, powerful experience for me. I was crying just as the people were boarding the plane, others going through their routine activities, like just another day. They were so innocent; they did not know that their lives would soon change forever or end.This film is not just about the passengers aboard United 93. It is also about the air traffic controllers, because they went through the whole thing along with the flights. Imagine sitting there trying to guide the flights to safety and finding out that two of them had just crashed into WTC. The frustration of the red tape was shown very well. The passengers of United 93 came across as heroes at the end.Nothing was overacted. The power of this movie is in its honesty and understatedness. I read that some of the characters were played by real people that went through that experience. Normally when we go to movies, it is fiction, unless it is a documentary. United 93 is not a documentary. It is a tragic story of a tragic day in our lives- one that changed us forever in a way.I am surprised that United 93 is not doing as well as I had expected at the box office. Everyone in this country (USA) needs to see this movie, lest we forget what happened on that fateful day.One last thing- why did I not give it a 10? I thought the end was just a bit less effective. I don't mean that they needed to show the plane crash; we all know how it ended. The movie needed just a little something uplifting at the end, but that is just my opinion. This is a powerful movie, made with sincerity, and it does not manipulate the audience. I loved it.",9,0,2,10 May 2006
Finding Neverland," Beautiful, touching, heart warming.....
","I am going to run out of adjectives describing this movie. It is glorious. The screenplay, the acting, the cinematography are all superb, but most of all Johnny Depp. Is this the same actor that played Captain Jack Sparrow last year? What a range he has, as an actor! He is understated in his portrayal of James Barrie the play writer. Kate Winslet is beautiful, and the children are just wonderful. The toughest acting job belongs to Julie Christie and she does wonders with it.SPOILERS AHEAD.....Barrie, who has been unsuccessful as a writer and in his personal life, finds his muse in Sylvia (Winslet)- a young widow- and her 4 children. Their growing friendship is frowned upon by the society and Sylvia's mother. However, that is what Barrie really needs to write a great play. As the story develops we feel a part of the lives on the screen. When Sylvia becomes seriously ill, we sort of know what is going to happen in the end, but we cling to a hope that may be she will recover. James and Sylvia love each other but it is shown in such a beautiful and subtle way that it is a wonderful change from the crudeness we see on the screen these days. Sylvia wants to see 'Neverland' which is a creation of Barrie's imagination. When she is unable to go see his play on the opening night, Barrie brings the play into her house. By this time tears were flowing down both my cheeks and would not stop till the end. Everything is done so beautifully that I cannot describe it. I am definitely going to see this movie again.I hope it gets Oscar nominations for best picture, director, actor, actress, supporting actor & actress, cinematography, musical score, editing, and screenplay. I give it a 10!",10,1,2,19 December 2004
Monster," Difficult to watch, but well made
","SPOILERS AHEAD............I wanted to see this movie as soon as possible (before the Golden Globes award ceremony) mainly to form my own opinion of the performance of Charlize Theron.  I had heard so many glowing comments about it that I became a bit skeptical.  Physical transformation does not necessarily make a performance, but Theron seems to reach the emotional level needed to portray this character.  It was difficult to watch the movie, and I saw a couple of people walk out, but I sat through it.  I was pleasant surprised to see that the movie did  not suddenly end (with Aileen's capture by the police), and it did not drag either.  Most important, Theron's praise is well deserved and she certainly deserves at least an Oscar nomination.It is difficult not to feel sorry for her, and it is a tribute to Theron's acting ability, and to the screenplay.  Some may see this as an intent to justify her actions. In my opinion, the story simply tries to explain what may have motivated her to do what she did. I did not see any justification - even remotely- of her actions. At times I wanted to beg her to have mercy on the man she was about to kill.  At other times I wished that she had simply taken up a job to clean peoples' homes.  She was so completely separated from reality that she could not stop dreaming and could not think of such simple ways of making a living. Afterall, she had been a prostitute since age 13. She was now killing for money, which she wanted to use for realizing her dreams, which included goodbye to the life of a hooker, and becoming something wonderful, enjoying life, etc.I have to admit that I found the physical appearance of Aileen revolting.  I never even saw her pictures and did not know about her until this movie came out.  At times Charlize Theron appeared way too heavy, and 'monstrous', particularly next to the tiny Christina Ricci who played Selby.  I am not sure it was necessary to make her look that way, but may be it was, if the real life Aileen looked that way. The looks did get in the way of the performance, from my perspective at least. That was the only flaw I saw. Otherwise, Theron did a splendid job depicting a very difficult character, and adding complexity to it.As a movie, I found it difficult to watch, but I would not say it was over the top, considering the horrors committed by the woman.  The characters seem real. I had wondered how anybody could actually create a story for a movie out of such a drab news ('a Florida prostitute killed many men').  The story evolves as the relationship between Aileen and Selby evolves and finally ends.  The movie held my interest throughout, even though I knew how Aileen's life ended. It was a wasted life and one cannot help wondering 'what if she had received some kind of moral education early in her life'. Still, a murder cannot be justified.  Not everyone with a difficult life becomes a murderer. There is a reference to this at one point in the movie, when Selby's guardian lady tells her that having a difficult life is no justification for taking the wrong path.  I thought Christina Ricci portrayed Selby very well- young, innocent, unaccepted by her family, and vulnerable. However, she knew what buttons to push to get Aileen to do what she wanted. I thought she gave an excellent support to Theron, who really occupies the screen (literally and figuratively).I would recommend seeing this movie mainly for Charlize Theron's performance, but also to see the terrible suffering in life.",7,0,0,24 January 2004
The English Patient," A beautiful work of art
","When I first saw this movie, I was completely mesmerized from start to finish.  The breath taking cinematography, the haunting musical score, and the fine acting by Juliet Binoche, Kristin Scott Thomas, and Ralph Fiennes makes this an extraordinary film. However, the real credit for this masterpiece has to go to the Director and screenplay writer Anthony Minghela.  I read the book later, and found it to be horrible (I have had that experience with another Booker prize winner too). It is amazing that a movie based on that book could be that beautiful. It flows between the past and present with ease, and it is completely seamless. Although very long, I was never bored.  I have watched it several times since, and enjoyed it each time.",10,2,6,2 January 2004
The Notebook," Sensitive and wonderful
","It was nice to see a sentimental movie based on human emotions, instead of the usual special effects or violence.  The cinematography, acting, and music was fabulous.  I particularly liked the young couple. They had great chemistry between them and it really made the movie excellent. The older couple was very believable too.  James Garner and Gena Rowlands portrayed them so well.  By far this is the best movie of 2004.  I loved the way the story unfolded. Another thing I liked about the movie was that there were fresh new faces- Ryan Goslin and Rachel McAdams.  Rachel in particular was very beautiful. Joan Allen was also very good in the role of Allie's mother.I would highly recommend this movie to anyone that cares about human relationships and emotions.",9,0,0,25 July 2004
Hotel Rwanda," Outstanding!
","This is one of the best movies I have seen. Certainly the best so far this year. I am embarrassed to say I was ignorant of the events in Rwanda in 1994. Like one character in the movie said, people in other countries will see this on TV and say it is so horrible, but then they will go out and eat dinner. This movie skillfully tells of the horrors - the conflicts between Tutsis and Hutus, the genocide, without overdramatizing it. It was more like telling the facts. It held my attention from beginning to end.SPOILERS AHEAD................I remember one scene is particular. Paul (Don Cheadle's character) and his van driver are returning to the hotel late at night and suddenly the road is bumpy.Paul asks the driver to stop the van and steps out. Actually he falls out because he has just stepped on a corpse, and then the horrifying scene- he is surrounded by a very large number of corpses.There are also some very warm moments in the movie- Paul's family, his friends, employees, acquaintances, and the 'powerrful' people- his relationships to them are portrayed beautifully. He uses all his negotiations skills to save lives of over 1200 people. Without him they would have certainly died. He was a real hero who never gave up.The acting and direction were great. Don Cheadle is brilliant as Paul. I hope he will be nominated for the Oscar. He gets excellent support from the cast, and particularly Sophie, who plays his wife in the movie.It is hard to describe in words how effective this movie is. All I can say is- Go see it.",9,0,0,17 January 2005
Lost in Translation," A disappointment
","I had waited to see this movie for a long time. While waiting, I kept hearing how wonderful it was. For the first part, I really thought the movie had something, but it ended up with nothing.  The acting was very good, and the scenes were interesting.  However, there was no real storyline.  By the middle of the movie, it became dull and boring.  The end was OK, but by that time it was already clear that it did not have a real story with ups and downs. It stays at the same level throughout and that is its downfall. There were some very nice things in it, but overall, a big disappointment.",10,0,0,4 January 2004
Lost in Translation," Second time was charm
","Joey-tribiani was right.  I hated the movie the first time I saw it- in a theater. I actually fell asleep at one point. I decided to watch it on DVD just to find out if I missed something that others noticed and raved about. I was surprised to see that I really enjoyed the movie. Not only that, I could appreciate the subtlety, the way the two main characters behave toward each other- from being total strangers to soul mates.  In a traditional movie they would have fallen in love, but here they just enjoy each other's company, knowing that it is a temporary thing, and yet meaningful in a strange way. Bill Murray should have received the Oscar for this.  Scarlett Johansson is one of my most favorite actresses these days. Her unique beauty and intelligence really set her apart.  She portrays the character Charlotte with such ease, she is not acting at all.  The only criticism I have of the movie is that at times it drags a little.  It is interesting to watch the different places Bob & Charlotte visit, but the story does not move at all. The story itself is very simple and it is not an action packed movie. That's what I appreciated during my second viewing- this time on DVD.  I am going to watch in one more time to appreciate it even more. I really enjoyed the hospital scene and how Bob & Charlotte start caring for each other in subtle ways. It is not romantic but it is touching. SPOILER aheadTheir relationship is mostly platonic. However, after Charlotte discovers that Bob slept with another woman, she is slightly upset.  Bob follows her to the restaurant and she makes reference to his age. She must be feeling hurt and mad.  On their last night in Tokyo they hold hands in the restaurant. The last scene where Bob asks the driver to turn the taxi around, and Bob and Charlotte finally embrace, let their emotions out, and give a goodbye kiss, is very well done. I am not sure the screenplay is Great, but it is very creative and unique and Sophia Coppola deserves credit as screen writer and director for producing this movie.  I am glad that I did not dismiss the movie after seeing it the first time.  So those of you who thought it was an awfully boring film, rent a DVD and you might be surprised.",10,0,1,8 August 2004
The Aviator," Extremely Boring
","I went to see this movie with very high expectations. It was supposed to be a certain Best Picture nominee that would finally get Scorcese his Best Director Oscar, and possibly the best picture Oscar too. Given the history of the Oscars, it will not surprise me if Scorcese wins the Oscar for his not so good effort. IMO neither the movie nor the direction lives upto the hype. Half way through the movie, I was bored to death. When it finally ended, with DiCaprio saying the same sentence 20+ times (it was quite irritating), I heaved a sigh of relief. There is too much detail, not enough pace, and the screenplay is nothing to write home about. There is some good acting, which may be the only saving grace of this movie. Dicaprio brings out the eccentricity of the main character quite well, but the story never really takes off. One good scene in the movie is when the Howard Hughes character has to defend himself. Leo carried that scene well. Overall, a HUGE disappointment.",6,90,167,30 December 2004
Cold Mountain," A good movie, worth seeing
","I found the openings scenes of this movie a bit too much to handle.  Same goes for some of the scenes in the middle (I won't go into the descriptions; they were simply horrible).  It was intended to be that way of course, to bring home the horror of the civil war. The movie is about how people survived the civil war, despite their losses.I got into the movie in the second half better, which probably means after Ruby (Rene Z.) comes on the scene.  Upto that point it seemed like a usual love story. I have not yet read the book.  The movie grows into a beautifully touching work toward the end.  My favorite episode in the movie is the one involving Natalie Portman, and she is not even one of the major characters. The main characters Jude Law and Nicole Kidman are believable, although Kidman did not initially appear so.I loved the cinematography, and the scenery which I understand is from Romania.  When the movie ended, what I was left with was knowing a little more about the people that lived through the civil war. The movie was not that much about the war- who won, how, etc.- but about how it changed the lives of the people.I found this movie to be a bit too long. Still it is worth seeing.",Null,0,0,2 January 2004
Million Dollar Baby," One of the best movies ever
","I went to see Million dollar baby after reading raves over it. I carefully avoided reading anything that alluded to what happens in the latter part of the movie, but I knew it was going to be emotional.This is a story of a young woman (Hilary Swank)who has nothing, but she wants to be something/somebody by learning to box. Her persistence pays off when a well known trainer (Clint Eastwood) agrees to coach her, though reluctantly. With training and hard work she becomes highly successful, and almost unbeatable. Her finances improve 'considerably'.SPOILERS AHEAD: The movie is told from the eyes of the trainer's assistant (Morgan Freeman). That alone gave me a hint of what was to come, but I was not prepared for the turn the movie took. I was totally overwhelmed. It was such a powerful experience that next morning I was still feeling the emotions. The acting is subtle and powerful by all three major characters. There is no melodrama, no overacting, which shows that emotions CAN be communicated with subtlety just as powerfully as with any other approaches. Eastwood deserves a lot of credit as director.Major SPOILER ahead: There are several unanswered questions, like what happened to the boxer who injured Maggie by throwing an illegal punch? What were the legal implications? Did Maggie or Frankie or Freeman's character feel a rage over what had happened? The events in the movie are obviously devastating and these questions may actually be only minor points when it comes to developing the characters. Nothing could reverse what happened to Maggie, and what Frankie eventually did was out of love, which made it 'right' from my perspective. I am still heartbroken for these characters. This is what life is. It is not a 'feel good' movie but it is a very powerful one. It definitely deserves the best picture Oscar nomination.The boxing gym atmosphere is created very well. The minor characters too are portrayed well. I thought the crazy guy was a bit of a nuisance in terms of the flow of the story, but again the purpose was to create an atmosphere and bring characters to life. This was done extremely well. There are touches of humor throughout, which add to the entertainment value, but this is a movie that will make you think about life, values, and our intentions.I will probably see it again to fill in on anything I may have missed. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that appreciates drama.",8,1,2,12 February 2005
World Trade Center," A little disappointing
","I went in there with very high expectations because the review in the local newspaper was very positive. I came out a bit disappointed.Spoilers ahead.....The movie started great- we all remember that morning, what were we doing when we saw the news. It was nice to see what the people involved were doing that morning- for example McCoghlin getting up at 3:25am to go to work, driving to his office, it being just another day, etc. The men knew nothing about the second tower since they were rushing to the first one. The images were astounding, even though we have seen them hundreds of times by now. The reactions of the people in NYC were shown well. The whole scene was recreated as it happened that morning. The movie really built up to the point where McCoughlin and Jimeno and others in their group got trapped.It was good to see initially what the families were doing, how did they find out, their worries, etc. However, at some point the movie lost the intensity and got in a rhythm of WTC rubble-Family worries- WTC rubble - Family worries.....and so on. Even though this was the focal point of the movie, I think it would have been better to show what was happening to their other team members whose names McCoughlin called out when they first got trapped. We only saw one of them. They could have shown a subplot around the marine that came to the rescue of these two. While they were trapped, I think it would have helped to divert the attention to other areas of the WTC just to exemplify the horror that had just taken place. Afterall this was a story of many heroes, and not just the two officers and their families. The movie just did not reach the heights I had expected it to reach, although I did shed some tears along the way. I think including some other people in the story would have made the story more interesting from a movie perspective. Otherwise one might as well see a documentary, and there are some very good ones about 9/11/01.The acting by Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena was good as the two officers. It is challenging for any actor to express with only the face, without moving and without using hands and legs. They did a very believable job of showing what these two officers were going through. I read that the real life characters and their wives were very involved in the making of this movie, so I have to assume all the scenes were based on real life events. In the roles of the wives Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello were OK. Maggie was more believable than Maria, whom I liked very much in A history of violence but she seemed to be constrained by the role itself in this movie (just one or two emotions). However, the real star of this movie is the art direction. The visuals are great and they create the main impact. The weakness is the story, and I don't mean any disrespect to the heroes of 9/11/01.I cannot help comparing this experience with United 93. That one had me riveted. At some point in WTC I just wanted it to end. The back and forth between the families and the two men trapped under the rubble somehow got old. IMO the director needed to find a more creative way of showing it to really hit it home.I still gave it 8 out of 10 because it still is a very powerful experience. It just did not meet my very high expectations.",8,3,7,12 August 2006
Pride & Prejudice," Beautiful yet disappointing in a way
","Jane Austen's most popular novel has appeared on the screen many times successfully. I was almost afraid that it would be boring, but this wonderful story will never grow old.First the positives.The camera captures the beauty of the English countryside and makes this a worthwhile movie going experience. Brenda Blethyn and Donald Sutherland are excellent as Mr. & Mrs. Bennett. Judy Dench is good as always in the small role of Lady Catherine de Berg. Keira Knightley looks stunningly beautiful, and overshadows the elder sister Jane who is supposed to be the beauty in the family. Matthew McFayden's Mr.Darcy is handsome and sensitive, but needs more pride to be like the character in the book. Mr.Charles Bingley was amiable but just a little too sweet. Lyida the youngest sister and Mr.Wickham were played well in limited roles. The humor which is present throughout the novel is just as effective in the movie. One scene that is effective in the movie is when Elizabeth tours Pemberley and walks around the museum. She sees the statue of Mr.Darcy (I think in the book it was a painting, but can't be sure) and her expressions soften. We can see that her opinion of him is changing and perhaps she is regretting what she missed.Now the negatives.Keira Knightley's Elizabeth looks too modern in her posture, walking style, and even hairstyle. She is brilliant in some scenes (esp. when she tells Mr.Darcy that he would be the last person in the world she would marry). In some other scenes though all she seems to do is narrow her eyes or smile. The fault may lie in the script, which is not completely honest with Austen's novel. In the book Mr.Darcy proposes to Elizabeth at the Collins's house, and second time at the Bennett house (outdoor, IIRC). The movie took liberties with the locations. Darcy and Elizabeth somehow meet in the rain when he proposes to her the first time. What was she doing all alone there? This was supposed to be 18th century England. In the second proposal scene, which is even worse, They both wander outside early morning and run into each other ('I could not sleep'; 'Neither could I'). The dialog sounds too modern, and so is the scene. The screen writers would have been better off using Jane Austen's writings which were much more effective.The movie is more effective when it is following the book closely, particularly the dialogs and locations. I was disappointed in the way some things had been changed from the original version and it did not improve the movie. It did the opposite. It would have been good to show at the end how Mrs. Bennett was thrilled to see 3 of her daughters married, and shots of the two couples -The Darcys and The Bingleys- would have been more appropriate than the romantic last scene between Darcy & Elizabeth. I wish the screenplay had been written better.Overall the movie is worth seeing, in spite of the flaws, because of the beautiful cinematography, and good acting by the cast.",6,3,7,6 February 2006
Mystic River," A bit disappointing
","The way this movie began, raised my expectations. The acting was superb, by Penn, Robins, Bacon, Linney.  However, there was a huge gap between the childhood and the middle aged men.  We learn more about the in betweens as we go along.  The movie reached a certain level, and after that it seemed to fall off, instead of climbing even further. I have to admit I was disappointed at the end.  There are a lot of very good things about the movie, but I don't really see what is the point of it.  Just life?I gave it 7 out of 10. It had the potential for a higher score. I think the basic flaw is with the story itself.  It is still worth seeing once.",7,0,0,1 January 2004
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," It was worth the wait!
","I waited for this movie for 3 years and decided to see it on the opening day- something I have never done for any movie. It was spectacular in its special effects and battle scenes, and fast and effective in its story telling. It makes quite an emotional impact toward the end when Anakin finally falls in the river of lava and has to be rebuilt into the masked Darth Vader. The acting was excellent. Hayden Christensen shows the conflicting emotions very effectively. Ewan McGregor made me cry at the end, and so did Natalie Portman. Ian McDiarmid is back as 'the emperor' and the dark Sith Lord Darth Sidious. He is scary and disgusting at the same time. It is easy to see that Anakin accepts him as his master and does not question him out of fear. Anakin/Darth Vader spirals into the dark lord very quickly by killing the innocents. We keep wishing that he would return to Obi-Wan and the Jedi but we already know what happened in the original trilogy.The story blends very well with the original trilogy. The music is dark throughout, as is the mood. Occasionally there are lighter moments because of Artoo and Yoda, but basically it is an emotional movie that makes a big impact. Even with the violence, it does not go totally out of control, and I will have no problem taking children to this movie. Lucas deserves a lot of credit for the whole series and a lifetime achievement award for changing the face of cinema.I highly recommend it.",10,5,10,19 May 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A Great Achievement
","After an almost unbearable wait I was able to finally see this film. I plan to see it again, but for now this will do. Sometimes you hear so much about something that your expectations reach the sky and when you finally see it, it is a bit of a disappointment. i would not call ROTK a disappointment, but it could have been even better.  It is astounding that the 3 LOTR movies were delivered every December for 3 years on schedule. The whole trilogy was filmed at once, and the individual parts came out as the three LOTR movies. It is an amazing feat.First, what I loved about the movie.  The special effects, art direction, the magnificence of everything are unparalleled. In fact without the technological advances this movie could not have been made.  The acting was excellent, even though nobody won an Oscar nomination.  The characters were well developed throughout the trilogy, and by the time I saw ROTK, I knew them pretty well. This is an example of fantastic story telling. I particularly liked the part toward the end where Frodo feels the ill effects of carrying the ring and is going to be a victim of greed, but Sam pulls him back from disaster.  It stresses what kind of a selfless and devoted person Sam is, and how difficult the task of carrying the ring had been all along. Even Frodo had difficulty with it.  The last scenes where everything is burning are out of this world.Now the (somewhat) negatives.  I felt, as I did in Two Towers, that the story was sacrificed a bit to accommodate the special effects, the war, etc. The fighting got just a bit too long for me.  I would have preferred to see more about the story- e.g. why did Arwyn (Liv Tyler) give up her immortality to marry Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen)? I would have liked to see more dialogues/interaction between good and evil (Gandalf and Saruman).  We saw some of this in earlier LOTR movies, but it would have been nice to somehow bring those into the final movie.  At the end when Aragorn marries Arwyn, it seems too sudden.Except for a few minor flaws this is a great movie, and a great trilogy.  I hope it wins the Best Picture Oscar and possibly the Best Director Oscar too.  When you consider the long list of people involved in the making of this film, this is a monumental achievement.",6,1,2,1 February 2004
