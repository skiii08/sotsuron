The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Very long and very boring
","I really enjoyed the first two films, and was looking forward to the next installment. However all I saw was 2 hours of Jennifer Lawrence looking either angry, miserable or crying. There didn't seem to be anything of value to make this an actual independent film. When all is said and done this film will be the one out of the boxset which everyone will just skip. I don't see how they couldn't make mockingjay just one film, even if it lasts 2 and a half hours. I haven't read the books so I'm not sure how much is left to see but nothing happens in the film. This could have easily been cut down to 30/40 minutes. Very disappointed and highly unlikely to go watch the next installment.",3,28,40,3 December 2014
