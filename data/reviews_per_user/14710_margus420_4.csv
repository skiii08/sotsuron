Ford v Ferrari," Beautiful story and acting
","Both Matt and Bale do a wonderful job acting here. The story itself is a beautiful one. It's a story about passion, about overcoming obsticles, about friendship and above all - the drive to win. Although the movie is quite long it does not feel like one. It sits you in for a ride that has its ups and downs, yet never gets boring or starts lagging.I loved this piece and would recommend to everybody weather a car or racing fan or not.",9,1,3,29 December 2019
The Irishman," A masterpiece of cinema
","I'm a huge fan of Martin Scorsese and was excited to view the latest title by the master. This is an oude to cinema and filmmaking. It's a masterful piece about the maffia crew, about betrayal and brotherhood. It definetly ranks as one of the top movies done by the master. While it's quite long, its an enjoyable experience which takes you in the world of Mafia for 3 plus hours. Great acting by Al Pacino and Robert de Niro. A must watch.",10,2,8,8 December 2019
American Psycho," An interesting story told marvellously
","American psycho takes a deep dive into the mind of an psychopath. Beautiful acting by Christian Bale. It's a movie with twists and turns, and displays filmmaking at its best. Maybe it's an view of the American corporate and business life in the 2000s as there are many such characters played by Christian Bale walking among us.",9,1,1,8 December 2019
