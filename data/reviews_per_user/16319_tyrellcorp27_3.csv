Ali," Who was Ali?
","Who was Ali?  You would never know after watching this movie, for you will gain no insight of the man who is one of the greatest figures of the 20th century. Ali's life deserved an examination on film, such as Spike Lee's 'Malcolm X'.  This movie is a big disappointment.  Especially since it was directed by one of my favorites, Michael Mann.Mr. Mann's direction and Mr. Smith's performance have one thing in common...they lack passion.  Will Smith goes through the movie doing a one-note impersonation of Ali.  His mannerisms and expressions are the same whether he finds out he's been banned from boxing; been banned from practicing his religion; or won his Supreme Court case. The only strain on Mr. Smith's acting skills were when he learns of the death of Malcolm X and when he stares at a mural on a wall in Africa.  Even in these scenes, it's as if Mr. Mann had to keep the camera on Mr. Smith long enough to get a tear rolling. Mr. Mann also gives no insight to the men around Ali, or his women.
Finally, the casting of Mario Van Peebles as Malcolm X and Giancarlo Esposito as Ali's father were serious errors in judgement.  It's as if Mr. Mann handed Mr. Van Peebles a pair of thick-rimmed glasses and a goatee and said 'You are Malcolm X'. Mr. Esposito looks about a year or two older than Will Smith and he is supposed to be playing his father.  I'm sure with all the great black actors in Hollywood today, Mr. Mann could have done better in the casting department.This movie is even more of a disappointment when you realize that this is it:  There will probably never be another attempt to capture Ali's life on film.  Hollywood had it's chance and it blew it. Big time.",5,0,0,27 December 2001
Underworld," All Style, No Substance!
","First time director Len Wiseman definitely knows how to make a good looking movie, but not much else. Mr. Wiseman has nailed down the look that is evident is most of today's vampire movies: dark, grainy, gothic, leathery, bluish hued skin and RAIN!  Lots and lots of RAIN.  Most annoyingly, outside of the terrible overacting of Shane Brolly as Craven (he espouses anger in EVERY look and in EVERY word he utters) and the stoic, zombie-like acting of Kate Beckinsale is the director's use of DOORS! Every damn scene of this movie either starts or ends (and sometimes both)with someone slamming open/closing a door, or gate. My guess is that doors must swing to and fro over 100 times in this movie.  This must have been the editor's first movie and asked the director to use the doors as cues for his cuts. Once I pointed this out to my friend, he couldn't stop laughing every time a door swung.The plot is pretty thin and close to being stupid. Plot spoiler follows: Why would the leader of the vampires and the werewolves want to create a mixed, super breed of half vampire, half wolf? The new super wolfpire would surely doom the vampires and werewolves to extinction. Secondly, we are continuously told that the vampires defeated the werewolves and pushed THEM to the edge of extinction.  Yet, except for the finale, every fight between vampires and werewolves is dominated by the werewolves.
So if you just want to have a good laugh and watch a stylish vampire flick, 'Underworld' is for you.  But if your looking for a crafty, fast beat, well directed movie (e.i. 'Blade II'), it ain't this one.  You'll be bored to death and you'll learn to HATE DOORS!",5,13,25,19 September 2003
WALLÂ·E," Directed by AL GORE!
","While I enjoyed the movies score, animation and the inventiveness of the movie, WALL-E is hurt by the fact that the filmmakers shove the environmental message down our throats and the film succeeds in becoming a propaganda movie that will indoctrinate our children to the 'green' cause. Humans in the movie, despite what the writer tries to tell us in a 10 second explanation for our girth, are depicted as obese, slovenly destroyers of the Earth and machines, with infant minds capable of learning, are the saviors for all mankind. Change the topic and set the movie in 1930s Germany and you the perfect goose-step movie. On a side note, I would be curious to know why the directors chose the movie 'Hello Dolly' to be the inspiration for much of the main characters behavior. That movie seems a bit remote of a reference for the young children in the audience.",5,15,48,29 June 2008
