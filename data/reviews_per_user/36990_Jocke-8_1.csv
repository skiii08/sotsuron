Casablanca," One of the best films ever made!
","This is simply one of the best movies I have ever seen. An intriguing plot, complicated love story and a historic background gives it a perfect combination. Not to forget the excellent cast, and as Swede I'm especially proud of our beautiful actress Ingrid Bergman.",10,1,1,11 March 1999
