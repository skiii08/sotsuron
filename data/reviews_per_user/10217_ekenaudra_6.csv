Sucker Punch," no substance
","have you ever dated a beautiful person just to find out that all they offer to the relationship is something pretty to stare at, and maybe some fireworks in the bedroom? well, that is kinda what this film was for me. beautiful CG, beautiful women, and beautiful cinematography... no substance. the plot was ehhh, the storyline was blah, and overall i walked out of the theater filling like i'd just eaten a tub full of empty calories. **SPOILER ALERT DON'T READ IF U DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE DETAILS OF THE MOVIE** the movie is about a 20 year old girl who's mother passed away, her evil stepfather 'stereo typically played by a big, Bald, ugly fat man' gets angry to learn that his deceased wife left her entire estate to her two daughters. in a rage he kills the youngest, and blames the oldest Emily Browning AKA Babydoll for the murder... He quickly takes her to a mental institute for young teen girls. (BTW ALL of that happened in the span of the opening credits.) upon arrival, babydoll learns that she will be falsely lobotomized by the end of the week b/c her stepfather paid the evil orderly 2K to forge the main doc's signature, thus prohibiting babydoll to be able to talk to the police (again, all of this info is divulged within the first 15 mins of the movie) in the next scene babydoll is strapped to a chair and prepared for her lobotomy when she is thrown into an alternate reality where she is an orphan being dropped off at a club by a priest (her stepfather) she is told that because she is a virgin she will wait for the end of the week when a 'high roller' who is willing to pay a lot of money will be in the club and thus will 'pluck her flower'. babydoll is called out by the dance teacher (also known as the main doctor in the real reality) to practice a dance, and so when she closes her eyes; she is once again transported to yet another alternate reality where she gets weapons and fights big guys (awesome scene!) when she is finished kicking @ss in a sailor moon outfit she is transported back into the 1st alternate reality... and this 'back and forth jumping from the 1st alternate reality to the 2nd one' goes on for the next 1 hour and 40 mins. until it ends in the original reality (the one where she is in the mental institute) overall awesome fight/action scenes, but boring storyline/plot for the rest of the movie...ultimately this is a movie for guys of ALL ages who like hot girls in short skirts, guys who play video games, and people that like to see things blow up. as a woman i liked seeing 'girl power', hair and makeup fashions, and the end glittery sailor moon outfit was AAWWEESSOME!! while my husband (who likes hot girls and video games) appreciated the action and girl scenes i was appreciating the glittery tights and awesome buckle platform heels (wondering if the 'sucker punch' costume will be available at Halloween express this October) I give it 5 stars for the action and pretty factor, but only 5 stars b/c the plot and storyline left me going 'eeeh'",5,6,15,26 March 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," last 30 mins was awesome...
","I just finished reading Littlesongbird's review of Breaking Dawn part 1, and I couldn't agree more with the accurate and well written review. especially: 'Kristen Stewart is much better than she is in New Moon, with much less of the moping and dead pauses, but some of her line delivery is still awkward and her facial expressions for my tastes are lifeless' In fact my poor husband whom I drag to all these movies (mainly because he drags me to see all the comic-book hero movies) even he has commented on how weird and ugly she looks when she makes those awkward faces. she didn't seem to be like that in the runaways, or the messengers. it's almost like she adopted those mannerisms specifically for this character. but sorry i didn't mean to go off on a tangent.the movie was OK... I agree that the last 30 mins was suspenseful and interesting. I kinda thought that they would have spent more time on the delivery/death scene. I know in the book it was through Bella's perception but to make it more interesting it would have been nice if it wasn't so blurry. I mean reading that scene in the book made me cry. mostly because I really care for the characters of Bella and Edward, but also because it was just horrific. seeing that scene in the movie I didn't feel hardly as much emotion as i did reading it mostly because i don't really care much for the actors portraying the characters and therefore I wasn't emotionally moved. the movie did a great job making Bella look sickly and weak; it was hard to see some of the scenes of her pregnant.the first 75% of the movie was uneventful. 40 mins into the start of the movie and she is still setting up for her wedding. flash forward to isle Esmee and its one sweet ocean scene (which BTW I thought was done very tastefully, though there could have been more romantic dial-ague.) and then after that it is a montage of chess playing, kissing, swimming, and Bella flaunting around in Victoria's secret lingerie. an upset maid, a revelation of pregnancy, and then a frantic packing scene to head back home.personally I didn't like the book... it was one of my least faves due to the fact that it was so boring. it had more to do about Bella getting married/pregnant/dying and more to do about Jacob getting mad/protecting Bella/and imprinting on the baby. and Edward was just sorta eye candy in the book and in the movie.... I thought that this would have been a perfect opportunity to showcase why these two are in love. the first half of the movie didn't have to be word for word from the book. it didn't have to be a montage of wedding shots, honeymoon shots and a pregnancy. I would have enjoyed a little bit more depth and bite to their relationship. more complicated dialogue, more passion, and romance. this movie did not convince me that they were in love. and what was up with the speech scene at the reception? they ate up more time then it needed to.Part 2, I'm afraid is going to suck; because so much happens in that movie: Bella turns, discovers powers, they have to deal with renesmee, and Jacob constantly being around, then there's the Volturi and the big battle scene not to mention the immortal child coming forth to pretty much testify that he is not a monster, and the cottage scene, a lot to cram into the movie and I doubt that it is going to do the book justice. I'm actually dreading the opening scene of the 2nd part where Bella jumps up gracefully and is all cat like and animalistic, talks to her 'new' family and then goes hunting with her beloved... I just can't see how Stewart is going to be able to convey 'graceful' and 'cat like' I can only imagine that she is going to stumble off the bed, do a lot of awkward silent pauses, bite her lip a lot and pretty much just kinda spazz out a little, before the goes off hunting for the first time...",4,6,10,25 November 2011
The Hunger Games," i don't get the hype, it was OK but... IDK
","first of all shaky cam does not need to be in ever single scene! i came to see a movie not get sick from one.i didn't understand the crowd of movie goers seeing this movie... i'd reckon that 60% were twilight, twihard teen girls who scream and clap at everything! I'm sure the books are better, but the movie was anti climatic, I didn't see a good enough established connection between the hero and her little sister, or her best bud - the uglified guy from 'the last song' OK so the next thing i didn't understand was the rainy flashback between the hero and her 'love interest'??? he threw bread at her when she was hungry, but he was rude about it, so she hated him?? huh? OK and later on he professes a crush on her but it seems like he is saying it to play up the crowd, the tension between them suggests that there is some attraction, but then the interaction the two characters have alone suggests that they are little more than strangers close knitted by a common circumstance.Peeta, the love interest, is a crowd loving manipulator who knows how to go with the flow whether that is on stage in front of a mob of an audience, or in a small group of killers in the woods he knows who the strong one is and he makes sure he is on their team. he comes across as a spineless worm who can lift heavy things and throw them very far suggesting that he has strength, but then they never showcase that in the movie...??? OK, and he is really good at painting himself to look like the background (rocks, trees, etc) but where is he getting the tools needed to do all of this intricate painting?? OK, so moving on when the story progresses why would the hero trust her love interest when he was accompanying a group of teens who were tracking her down to kill her? also, while we are on that topic, why would the less stronger players gravitate towards the stronger player when they know only one will survive? it seems that they would have killed the strongest player when they could cause they all have to die...so, i liked the movie enough, but i guess i didn't understand the hype... OK like when peeta and katniss kissed in the cave the entire movie audience screamed and hollered and cheered and clapped and i was like 'huh?' at the end of the movie when the cato fell off the structure below to a pack of rabid dog like beasts the audience roared to life with claps and cheering... i actually got creeped out at that point and turned to my husband and gave him a look... i could only imagine that that audience would be the crowd of people in portrayed in the movie that would watch with excitement the hunger games.so the audience was creepy and annoying, and the love thing between the two heroes was really weird... also the shaky cam was over done in the beginning of the movie.",5,20,31,23 March 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," I hated this movie!
","literally the first freaking hour of the movie they are still in the 'hobbit hole' Bilbo's house and slightly still introducing characters!There is a chase scene with orcs and a rabbit pulled sleigh and let me just say that i have seen better CG in Saturday Syfy 'original movies' might i add that 85% of the movie felt like i was actually watching a mix of half and half documentary and crappy syfy movie.even my husband who loved the books and animated movie from the 70s wanted so badly to see this movie and will continue to see the rest of the trilogy (because he is a loyal fan of the series (not P.Jackson)) BUT! if he wasn't a fan he would not see the rest of them. I thought that the movie was drawn out into a trilogy for the purposes of money, there could have easily been a sequel and that's it. if this movie came out before the lord of the rings movies i doubt that the LOTR Trilogy would have been so successful! omg seriously if i could rate this negative i would! horribly horrid movie.",1,15,49,16 December 2012
The Bourne Legacy," loved the two leads, but almost fell asleep...
","First of all, I'm not a hard core movie buff, and much like a routine; I hardly move from my comfort zone. that is why I saw Bourne Legacy b/c I have been head over hells in love with all three of the Bourne movies since college, (my husband never could quite understand) so I'm not going to give Bourne Legacy a bad rating, I rather enjoyed the movie regardless of whatever ego trip the director was on. I love Rachel Weisz, although I admit I can't think of much aside from Dream House, and those horrid 'Mummy' movies... but I was pleased to see that she was the leading lady in this movie, but I must admit (and it is no secret to my husband who just rolls his eyes anytime I swoon) but I have been carrying a movie crush torch for Jeremy Renner since Avengers (OK... ever since Hurt Locker) but Avengers/Ghost Protocol have most certainly fanned the flames, and now Bourne Legacy has too. Truth be told I didn't get this movie; it was sorta like a dying car jerking back and forth.. it just never really seemed to achieve that 'get up and go' pep that it needed to carry it through convincingly to the end. the beginning was like 'OK, whats going on?' the middle was like 'OK, now whats going on and when is this gonna get interesting' and by the end of it (after the typical Bourne fight scenes were injected) it was more like 'WHAT?!?! this is totally awesome!' so yes people I watched pretty much nothing and enjoyed it, so what?I don't care... I could watch Renner peel grapes using two chopsticks for 3 hours and I'd still be mesmerized... well, OK thats a stretch, but definitely if he was sweaty, shirtless, and kicking @ss in a Macgyverisque sorta way; using said chopsticks and grapes!!!",10,1,9,8 September 2012
Fifty Shades of Grey," I just don't know how I feel about it
","I just came from watching this with my husband. And no I didn't really drag him to it, unlike how I dragged him to the twilight movies (God how he hated me for that) but I feel he didn't put up too much fuss because he knew he would be seeing some T&A. I honestly don't know what to say, I never read the books except I tried reading a couple of pages while at a bookstore once, and honestly the writing was horrible, I've known 8th graders who could put out better writing.I really didn't care much for the movie, I didn't think there was enough character evolution, and the plot was just lacking.. honestly I'm a very sexual woman, I loved the nymphomaniac movies, and I've watched true bondage where the women are truly subs being humiliated by doms. I would classify this as soft core BDSM. A riding crop, flogger, a bit of spanking, lots of binding, and yeap that's about it. But even with that said I was actually surprised at how bashful I was at some of the scenes. I wasn't expecting myself to be so bashful about it.It wasn't the worse movie I've ever scene, Colin Farrell in Alexander takes the number one spot for that one. My husband thought that at least this movie was better than the twilight movies. I just don't know. I guess I'd see it again? And I'm a little curious what happens next in the storyline...",6,5,11,14 February 2015
