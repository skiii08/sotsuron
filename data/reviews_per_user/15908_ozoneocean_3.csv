Minority Report," Well realised but flawed future thriller
","This is one of Spielberg's better films. It's a highly competent, Blade-Runneresque vision of the future that was highly influential in its depictions of gesture computing, personal transport, advertising, and people tracking. There are scenes here directly influenced by David Cronenberg and Ridley Scott. The atmosphere is tense and pace is handled very well throughout. The story is interesting in its treatment of precognition as a scientific crime-fighting tool. Spielberg does well to set up a convincing future world with a bizarre mystery at the center of the story.Where things unravel is towards the end of the film. What begins as a clever, twisty tale with a very interesting and unusual concept, ends with a bog-standard and very tried trope which does not do the rest of the film justice. The final twist and reveal are extremely weak, not even to the level of a weekly TV detective story. It's a disappointing flaw in an otherwise exciting and thought provoking SciFi thriller.",7,0,0,31 March 2013
Silent Hill," Almost arty.
","As a game adaptation film this is apparently very good, however I haven't played the game so I'll have to judge this on its merits as a stand alone theatrical production.Silent Hill is a mystery horror film. The mystery is sort of interesting and sort of compelling, till it's all mostly revealed near the end and we find that the driving plot was really pretty silly. As for the horror aspects; it's not scary but it IS gross.Visually this is a lovely film. The scenes are beautifully shot, the sets are great, and the monsters are fantastic. The scene with the jerky bodied nurses was wonderful, I kept wanting a strobe light to play over them and techno blasting in the background. The constant eerie atmosphere created by the dulled light and twilit colour worked perfectly and gave the film a 'waking dream' feel.But, the story just couldn't match the clever visuals and the child actor that played the little girl roles wasn't convincing in any of them. They'd have done better to have an adult play the demon version with the child actor miming along. All in all a good looking film, but long and with a weak story, fine acting from all except the child.",5,0,0,10 April 2013
Lord of War," Artistically beautiful
","Lord of War is cartoonish movie with a serious message delivered with dark comedy, exaggerated scenes, and wonderfully artistic visuals.All in all it's a good film to educate people on the morality of arms dealing and give you a very broad brush caricatured look at the practice. In reality someone of Yuri's level would never, ever leave his city, let alone ever meet his clients in person- Those people have middlemen up the wazoo... but by illustrating a direct connection it gets the point across easier.Some negatives- His pretty-boy brother was a little too much. The collapse of the sweet, innocent, handsome blue-eyed boy because of the bad things his nasty big brother Yuri did was simply over-egging the pudding. Also, the scene with Yuri's wife finding out 'the truth' in the 'wife discovering the Other Woman' type fashion was a bit TOO silly.",8,1,2,3 March 2013
