The Devil's Advocate," my my, a bloody good film
","this film was a real surprise, i thought! being a keanu reeves fan, after so many films you just think 'whyyy' (the likes of johnny mnemonic - THE worst film in the history of cinema, etc etc can really taint an image of an actor for sure). then i came across this gem of a film, and was utterly surprised. i think that al pacino and keanu reeves were on par with each other, al pacino being amazing and natural on camera as always. the script writing is fantastic, as is the direction. if you haven't seen this film i'd highly recommend it. also charlize theron was excellent as well. and the soundtrack was perfect for this type of film.9/10",10,1,2,11 July 2004
