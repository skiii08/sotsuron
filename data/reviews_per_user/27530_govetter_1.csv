Blade Runner 2049," This has to be the BEST long-awaited sequel EVER! Soo many questions answered, soo many more created.
","I have been a connoisseur of Blade Runner lore since November 2019. (Actually 1997, including Blade Runner The Game) I don't know how else to COMPLIMENT Denis and the Fanimation crews that made this Black Out 2022 mini-movie happen! Thank YOU ALL!
(It reminds me of the Matrix Trilogy, where the Animatrix fills in a LOT of backstory!)Watching it AGAIN! (#22?) And catching more bits every time. ;-)",9,0,11,30 July 2018
