The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Short Plot Summary

Lawrence is perfect, the rest of the team at a high level, a political game cleverly designed. At times the action drags, but the script pulls out of boredom over Lawrence. The film feels overcrowding new characters, so they have the old minimum playing time. I can not help feeling that would not split the whole experience was more complete, and thus in the name of money cut good potential. If the first part was good, the second was even more improved version of the first, but the third part sums up the whole story in one goal Civil War",8,0,9,22 February 2015
