Men in Black 3," A very entertaining flick that brings the trilogy full circle!
","I just saw this film here in Taipei and I must say it was brilliantly entertaining. I won't give too much away (Semi-spoiler alert) or over hype the film for anybody who has not seen it. All I will say is that it is full of laughs, edge-of-your-seat thrills, and even a few tears. This film truly brings the series full circle and has a surprise that will put a smile on any MIB fan's face! Don't expect the same characters from movies past to have any sort of dominant role (Agent J and K excluded of course). This MIB comes at you from a whole new angle! 1969, Apollo, Civil Rights, Andy Warhol, the list goes on and on. It's a fascinating re-mix of the well established franchise that is sure to delight many a moviegoer. I hope it entertains everybody else as much as it entertained me!",9,10,20,23 May 2012
