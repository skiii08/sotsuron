The Incredible Hulk," Much Better...They Actually Get It Right
","I can say that almost everyone's expectations were low on this film ever since Ang Lee's Abomination (no pun intended) that was known as 'Hulk' So now it's been 5 years since that film and already we've gotten a Reboot sequel from Universal once again.Now the one thing I was looking for in this film, was not an excellent story, but at least some good action, acting, and a movie that was far more superior than it's predecessor.Well...with 'The Incredible Hulk' I got just that. If it had not been for Edward Norton and Tim Roth, then the film wouldn't nearly be as good.But still, they finally get it right. The Hulk this time around is meaner, stronger, and resembles the comic book character a lot more.Yes the CGI makes him look unrealistic, but what do you expect nowadays? But still. The Hulk in this film is a freaking monster. He'll tear up anything and everything when he feels threatened. He's like a wild animal.The action sequences were good as well. The final fight scene is definitely the highlight of the film. I won't spoil what happens but It's definitely worth the price of a ticket.Within the story, which has a few problems, Edward Norton really became Bruce Banner. In fact he felt so much like Bill Bixby.Overall, The Incredible Hulk was a good Action Summer film and a movie far better than it's predecessor.8/10",8,2,3,18 June 2008
