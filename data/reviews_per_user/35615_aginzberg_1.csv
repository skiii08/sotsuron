Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A good excuse for a nap.
","I never thought that a movie with 3 consecutive climaxes could still lull you to sleep. The 'dream makers' that are responsible for this sacrilege are more concerned with mass appeal than with the prospect of an innovative story and endearing characters. So please before you e-mail me and tell me what a great work of art this supposed movie is go back and watch episodes 4,5,&6. Compare them to episode 1 and then you can save yourself the $20 on the next two movies.",1,41,77,27 January 2002
