Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," GOOD THINGS OUTWEIGH THE BAD HUMOR AND ANNOYING CHARACTERS
","After being such a big fan of the original trilogy, I often wondered how George Lucas could top it. But 'The Phantom Menace', despite a lot of negative reviews by critics, is destined to become a classic.I wish I could go back to May 19th when I was in the very first screening of the movie, when the words 'A LONG TIME AGO IN A GALAXY FAR, FAR AWAY' reappeared on the screen for the first time in 16 years. And then STAR WARS flashed across the screen, followed by the scroll and eruption from the audience.This is not your typical 'Star Wars' movie, mind you. But you do have to remember, this is a set-up for Epsiodes II & III (which will appear in 2002 & 2005, respectively) when we will see young Anakin Skywalker (played brilliantly in TPM) by Jake Lloyd turn to the dark side. Parts of the film are slow and it does drag at times, especially the scenes on Tatoonie before the Pod Race. But you have to keep in mind, they couldn't just throw Anakin on screen without telling his story. They couldn't just say, here's Anakin, he's a hopeful jedi.There are also characters in the film that are very annoying -- the Trade Viceroy and his fellow Nimoduians and Jar Jar Binks, who annoyed me within the first two minutes of his screen debut. It was clear that this movie was written for 10-year old children. There is too much humor and a lot of it is plain toilet humor (i.e. Jar Jar stepping in the pile of Bantha mess, the animal passing gas, etc.) The other thing I found disturbing was that Lucas took some things used in other 'Star Wars' films and recycled them. (i.e. replace Ewoks w/Gungans). The end scene is a combination of the end scenes of 'Return of the Jedi' and 'Star Wars.'Other than these little annoyances, the film was excellent. Good story, exceptional special effects, good acting jobs by the main characters (Nesson, McGregor, Portman, Lloyd)... Overall, this ranks third of my favorite 'Star Wars' movies.

The Shining," The Scariest Movie Ever Made
","Forget all these teenybopper slasher films (Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, etc.)..'The Shining' is the scariest movie I have ever seen.Forget the fact that 95% of Stephen King's novels make horrible movies (Maximum Overdrive - need I say more!?), 'The Shining' is the scariest movie I have ever seen.Jack Nicholson MAKES this movie work. If you saw the TV mini-series, you were treated to a much better looking Wendy Torrance and a story line that followed King's excellent novel. But there was no Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance, the crazed caretaker of the grand Overlook Hotel.Stanley Kubrick knew how to make 'The Shining' scary and suspenseful without pouring out buckets and buckets of blood and gore (minus a few scenes..the river of blood and the dead girls.)Overall, Nicholson delivers a stunning performance and one of the greatest lines in movie history.

Pulp Fiction," A Wild & Crazy Ride!
","PULP FICTION is indeed one of the most bizarre movies I have ever seen. It starts out in a diner where a man and a woman (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer) discuss armed robberies. The story is then broken off into three distinct strands: the date between a hit man (John Travolta) and his boss's wife (Uma Thurman), an over-the-hill boxer (Bruce Willis) on the run, and the clean-up of a hit man's mistake. The film returns to the diner scene for its ending sequence.If you saw Quentin Tarantino's first (and better) film, RESERVOIR DOGS, you should have no problem following the events of PULP FICTION, which are not told in chronological order.The performances in the film are outstanding, namely by John Travolta, who shines as tough guy hit man, Vincent Vega. Samuel L. Jackson is equally brilliant as Vince's partner, Jules Winfield, who reads a bible passage before he kills his next unsuspecting victim.Another strong point in the film was the good writing, which was also strong in RESERVOIR DOGS.Despite the fact that the film produces one of the grossest scenes I have ever witnessed in a film and a slow-moving middle, PULP FICTION still remains a damn good film, snubbed by the Academy when Oscar time rolled around in 1995. Samuel L. Jackson was well deserving of an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. The film did win an Oscar for Best Screenplay, although. GRADE: A-",Null,0,0,28 May 1999
Scream 2," Another Reason Why I Hate Sequels
","SCREAM 2 is the reason I cannot stand sequels. Let me rephrase that, I dislike sequels that cannot tell an original story. Gee, let's redo SCREAM and have new killers and move the kiddies to a college campus. Nice originality.The original SCREAM was borderline between a good and average movie, but re-doing it over again got repititous and boring. Not to mention, very predictable.

Any Given Sunday," The Second Best Football Movie
","Well, no football movie has ever topped 'North Dallas Forty,' but Oliver Stone's 'Any Given Sunday' comes pretty close. We don't see Nick Nolte with his beer for breakfast in this one, but we do get some pretty good performances from the cast. At 170 minutes, I wanted the movie to CONTINUE!!! It wasn't your typical dragging three-hour movie like 'Heat' or 'The Thin Red Line.' Minus the two Godfather movies (I refuse to acknowledge The Godfather III as a movie), this is one of the best movies pushing 3 hours I've seen.
I went into this movie not knowing that to expect because I cannot stand Oliver Stone's movies. In my opinion, they're all garbage. 'Natural Born Killers' was an absoulte waste of two hours. 'JFK' and 'Nixon' were all his sick and twisted history. But with 'Any Given Sunday,' Mr. Stone has made a film that I thorougly enjoyed. Grade: B+",Null,0,1,22 December 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Best Sequel Ever...
","Hey, I'm not afraid to call 'The Empire Strikes Back' the best sequel ever made, closely ahead of 'The Godfather Part II', 'Superman II', and 'Terminator II: Judgement Day.' Oh, and who could forget, 'Penetentairy II' (j/k)...Just when you thought Lucas couldn't top 'Star Wars,' he does. Everything about 'The Empire Strikes Back' made it a great movie: the special effects, the continuing character development, the story and the fact that the ending leaves us hanging, knowing there is more to be told.Look at the film as the second act of a three act play. In Act I (Star Wars), we are introduced to the characters. In Act II (Empire), the characters are put in a difficult situation. In Act III (Jedi), the conflict is resolved.Just like Episode II of the new trillogy, 'Empire' was in part, a love story between Han and Leia. This is a film not to miss.
