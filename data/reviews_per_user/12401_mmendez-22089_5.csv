Gremlins," Ferbie's Gone Wild!
","It took me forever to finally watch this 1984 cult-classic comedy/horror. The only thing I knew before viewing this film was that it included these 'ferbie'-like creatures and that something happens to when you add water to them. Little did I know that these cuddly weird beasts can morph into something grotesque. - Well, not really - I believe they mention that 'these' are the true GREMLINS.Now, the story begins with a father (Hoyt Axton; great performer), an inventor, comes across 'mogwai', a little furry, two-legged creature with ears like a bat, and decides that it is the perfect Christmas gift for his (17+ year old) son, Billy (played by the very UNTALANTED, Zach Galligan).The situation takes a turn for the worst after Billy becomes more attached to his new PET-best friend who is now named Gizmo CREDITS by his father) who begins procreating more clones of himself after an accidental spill of water on Billy's desk. This is around the time when little Cory Feldman comes into the picture. // **As time progresses, we find out the true meaning behind these BRUTES and what purpose lies ahead of them.***I found the ACTING in this film a bit campy and childish (amateur), as if it actually were made for kids. The only good acting jobs I see are done by Hoyt Axton, who I have already mentioned, and our lead damsel in distress, Phoebe Cates (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, 1982), who plays Kate Beringer, Billy's love interest. Other then that, I was not impressed.***What did grab my attention was the SET DISGN!! Oh man! for an 80s (Holiday) flick, this project really created a sense of style. I mean, with all the X-Mas lights and the changing from cloudy-green grass to snow-weather, it is ALLURING. +++ PLUS, the animatronics they (must have) used to design the gremlins was, still for this time (2015), really well done. I do give props to the guys who help design those suckers.I give this horror-com/VERY CHEESY movie a 6 out of 10 on IMDb. It did satisfy my needs, but I really did not think it was worth it too much to see. I could have lived without it; regardless I am very happy that I have finally embarked upon it and know what all the hype was about.-- Michael Mendez",6,0,1,28 September 2015
Black Mass," Keep Family Secret Recipes to Yourself!
","This is mayhaps the first film I have seen THIS YEAR with a cast that brought the project from a poor-old cliché-thing to ann instant success!Johnny Depp, of course, IS over-rated, but plays well for himself in this film; taking the roll of Jimmy 'Whitey' Bulger, a crazed, killing mobster back in the middle 1970s. The story follows mainly from his point of view; // making arrangements with his brother, Billy Bulger (played by Benedict Cumberbatch), who is a trusted governmental worker.It is until an old, childhood friend of theirs, John Connolly (Joel Edgarton), who works for the law, tries to reconnect with Jimmy who is a very cautious recluse; only hangs around with a small amount of friends; people he can trust. He makes a deal with the mobster where he will give away certain high-rollers so that the federal bureau and Bulger's crew can work together and keep each other from getting exposed.This movie reminded me very much in the style of Martin Scorsese sort of. I mean rooting for the bad guy (Depp) who you love to hate, seems already covered enough in the cinema-world. But none-the-less I really enjoyed this flick. Even though, it was more about the Irish-Americans rather than my Italian-Americans, it was still action- filled and had badass dialogue throughout the who film.If you guys read my reviews, you would know that I am one who is not about 'action' in movies, but Black Mass did everything so subtly, and unexacting. I have a real positive experience.",7,3,7,28 September 2015
Pawn Sacrifice," PERfecTion
","Last night I underwent what is now one of my top favorite screenplays of the year; started out on the Hollywood's 2009 Blacklist, PAWN SACRIFICE took me through the insecurities and stress in the mind of the worlds greatest chess master, Bobby Fischer.The unbeatable young adult, is portrayed by the king of the craft, Tobey Maguire who does a sensational job. He gets away with the Brooklyn accent as well as the ill-temper that gets to his head every five minutes. These are my favorite kind of films (as I have mentioned in my previous review for: Love and Mercy) where our main character undergoes a series of mental breakdowns just so that s/he can get his/her way.We follow the life of Bobby Fischer, from his adolescence, beginning as a 'chess prodigy' to his wonderful stand against the Russian government for permission to face their top chess competitors, since they contained the greatest ones in the world. As the film goes on, we come to recognize Fischer's sickness and how he is oblivious to his actions. Or maybe he sees himself doing these things, but enjoys that his mind going nutso. **Why would any human-being want to go through such pressure? Well, that is why I would say, 'watch this movie to find out.' I think he has a great purpose and am very proud that they took this SCREENPLAY out of the Blacklist. People need to hear the 'athletes' story and how hard he worked to accomplish what he did.I would also like to give MAJOR PROPS to, the one and only , Michael Stuhlbarg (A Serious Man, Boardwalk Empire, Blue Jasmine) who played the roll of Bobby's manager, Paul Marshall. To me, he was like the 'Paul Giamatti' of Love and Mercy; making every second well-worth-watch. He can also, be the 'Paul Giamatti' of Straight Outa Compton, which he honestly plays similar rolls of. // I would also like to acknowledge the work done by Liv Schreiber and Peter Sarsgaard; equally very talented performers and contributed perfectly to the film.I give this picture a 10 out of 10.",10,3,8,28 September 2015
Straight Outta Compton," Very ballsy.. But Delivered! :)
","Well, they delivered! I finally seen this uplifting film based in the late-eighties, early- nineties, of the rise and fall of one of the most notorious groups LA has ever breaded. NWA.To start off, the acting is on key and is done well by all the main characters of the story. I especially think Corey Hawkins (Dre) and O'Shea Jackson Jr. (Cube) in general were phenomenal; really ballsy on his (Jackson) part - following in his dad's footsteps // and for the first time, as far as I know - I don't think Ice Cube would be steered in the wrong direction, regardless.I found a lot of heart in the film. Not any romance, but the love for the game. You can really see who was the true artist and who was just lucky to be there for the ride. In a way, even though he doesn't seem like he's doing his part, Easy-E was a formable asset to the group. He was a spokesperson; a symbol, if you will; a person to look up to and have speak for a broken generation all around.I must mention that the film was roughly two hours and thirty minutes. Let me just say, that time flew by from how entertaining this film was. And it had nothing to do with the same bullshit; gang-war; violence; drugs; rioting. This film was interesting for it's dialogue. YES, MY FAVORITE. - It had heart, and that is how I know they found the right actors for the part.You see, this has been something that has been around for a long time now. Adults are not growing into their dull. boring lives // and it is good to reassure them that at one point, they were all about standing up to the system. Falk it!I gave this movie a slightly off-generous 4 out of 5 stars. There maybe have been a few things I needed closure with, such as Dre.'s story. But I hope to see better black cinema films after this. F. Gary Gray kicks ass at it again in this coming-of-age tale.Hope you enjoy!-- Michael Mendez",9,7,36,5 September 2015
High Fidelity," Give Me More Scenerios!
","Now this one was a tough call. Everyone knows how much I love movies with LOVE and HEARTBREAK, but this sort of took me by surprise, and NOT really in a good way. I watched this film first when I was nine, when my dad took me to see it. I probably didn't understand a word and was confused why the main character is hurt so much by a girl.. // What I do remember pondering was how Jack Black was the BEST! and how much I felt bad for the character, Dick (Todd Louiso), who takes so much shyt from him. Viewing it now, as a film student and somewhat a critic, I think he is the best part of the movie. No Joke! We all have those people in our life that make us feel a little awkward and just ask too many god-damn questions. I think he changes the most throughout the film, too. In fact, our main protagonist, Rob (played by John Cusack), does not change at all. That is why I am not being too reviewer-friendly with this entry.The thing is: I am a realist (sort of). I like movies to speak to me; give me some answers to the things that I should already know that I have not fully grasped yet. That, and the fact that I want to relate with something. But this story let me down towards the end. - I swear, that rarely happens.****Seriously, though! It is a universal understanding that 'once a cheater, always a cheater', and I do not take it lightly when someone ends up with the wrong person in the end. I wish it finished more truthfully; BETTER CLOSURE FOR THE BROKEN HEARTED. Not the old 90s ending where everything is okay, because it is not. Especially, for the viewer who, chances are, is alone and wonders why they cannot connect with anyone. I can go on forever, ranting about how I was let down in the climax of this film, but I do not want to bore you - and frankly, I do not want to write negatively about any project. **Maybe in ten more years, when I am a completely different person than I am now, I might enjoy the corniness, but as of right now - Too cliché (ONLY IN THE END, THOUGH).I rate this film a 6 out of 10. It honestly hurts me to do this, because I WANTED to like it. Really, I did! I WANTED it to be good, and a ahead of its time. In the end, I think it was nothing but an afternoons delight. — Heart-on!— Michael Mendez",6,0,4,9 September 2015
