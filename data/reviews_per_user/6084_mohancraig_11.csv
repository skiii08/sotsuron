Hereditary," Unpredictable
","I like when smaller Studios like A24 make Horror films... they are just so much more interesting than the movies the giant studios make to please the masses; smaller productions by default need to be more clever and while they may not smash Box Office records they bring joy to the few Savvy Connoisseurs.The movie starts with death and you're sure you know where it's going on with the Granddaughter Charlie but you don't because (shocking twist), then the Mom kinda in a way and then the Son and then the Mom in a big way and then the Father... the Mom again and then the Son but it all comes back to the Daughter.Does that make sense? No it doesn't which is why this is a great movie to watch!",8,2,4,10 July 2018
American Sniper," Real disappointment with some of my fellow reviewers
","I read a lot of one star reviews that claimed the movie was a bunch of propaganda and I can only conclude they are referring to the news footage in the film of the 9/11 attacks and several American embassy bombings that occurred around those years, I think the footage lends to the character development of Charlie the protagonist of the story and to anyone who saw those planes fly into those buildings as I did on that day who still draws out conspiracy for the sake of propaganda I'd say give it a rest because no one really cares what you think anymore.I was ready to give the film 9 stars just to offset the nonsensical rantings of all the one star voters but to be honest it wasn't as great of a combat movie as I'd been led to believe with the scale of 10 leaning towards a movie more like Black Hawk Down, truth be told I thought the action sequences seemed like something you see in a lower budget film or even something made for cable television and quite frankly I'm starting to wonder if Clint Eastwood hasn't become menopausal with all the tear-jerk reaction scenes that are shot each time Charlie Kyle comes home from a tour.Did I care for Charlie? Nah, he was kind of a dick but I would imagine most SEALS are, considering their really just trained for one thing and with that said I supremely value the contributions made by them on behalf of their fellow soldiers; this guy prevented the bloodshed of many American soldiers and for that he should be commended as he was with great pomp and fanfare... but seriously Clint just do a film without all the emo stuff for once will ya? I gag on that crap and have hated your movies since Mystic River for just that reason... start taking hormone replacement therapy or something to remove all this effeminate crap from your films. Thanks",7,2,19,20 February 2015
Nightcrawler," He's kind of a dick
","Our main protagonist is just a common thief from the beginning who evolves into opportunist that benefits from human tragedy... at first just what he encounters but then escalates to the tragedy he orchestrates for the camera (money being his only God), how he came about the extreme opportunistic ability to force those around him into submission is never really addressed except with a scene where he claims he took an online business course (with unlikely results). Gyllenhaal denigrates nicely but there seems to be no tipping point where he measures the pluses and minuses before making his decisions culminating in a clash of likability for the character and utter disgust.",7,1,5,8 November 2014
Man of Steel," Best explanation of General Zod
","This particular release goes into great detail of General Zod's motives which unlike the 1980 release of Superman II were never completely clear, the evil super trio simply arrived on earth destined to destroy Superman because of Jor'El's sentence of eternity trapped in space and because they wanted to be gods among mankind of earth.Here, while we may not agree we can grasp Zod's reasoning in that he is trying to save the race of his people and in fact Superman struggles to destroy the last vestiges of his home planet as he is still very much an alien to this world.Cast-wise Henry Cavill (plays Sup) is ripped like Superman should have always been (no disrespect Reeves), Amy Adams is okay with no real credit for this role (I hope they find someone else); lastly we have Michael Shannon..... Oh holy mother!!??! He played the perfect villain in a movie where he doesn't view any of what he does as villainous. He simply asks Cal'El to use the death of all humankind as the foundation for a new Krypton on Earth... Anyway Shannon is brilliant, overall the movie left me with few short pauses.",10,3,5,30 June 2013
The Revenant," This is what movies should be!
","Our group was split about which movie to see so half of us saw the Revenant and the other half saw the Hateful 8 (which I'd already seen twice)... man was I glad I saw the Revenant instead. The cinematography is just stunning, the CGI is most realistic (although you know it must be CGI because they can't train animals to do that stuff) and the story-line is compelling beyond belief.Because of all the running water in the movie I wanted to go pee after the first hour but each time a few minutes would pass another amazing event would happen which kept me glued to my seat as I didn't want to miss a single thing; see this movie if you love great film-making.",10,1,5,25 January 2016
Now You See Me," Cat and Mouse
","I was painfully disappointed in the storyline, I waited 3 weeks to see this movie because the show-times were so far apart I usually just saw something that was playing sooner; nearly 50% of the movie is chase scenes and trying to corner these elusive young magicians which is cool for an action movie but I was expecting something different.The plot never thickens... just unravels at random intervals, no real magic here to hang your suspension of disbelief on; instead everything is explained away almost as it happens. The movie had a great concept but it went up like 'flash paper'. Man of Steel was a lot better IMO.Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are fun to watch as they are both classic icons in the plot exposure role of cinema, they both do a fine job each his own fate are never completely reasonable to the viewer so much as they may be from the view of the protagonist.Really I just see curve-ball after the movie was in the tin.",6,0,3,30 June 2013
It Follows," Fantastic score
","The movie was pretty good too, it doesn't rely on a lot of 'startle takes' where something jumps out at you from the corner of the screen when you sort of already expect it but instead uses more of a 'creep-out' factor that kind of makes the hair on the back of your neck stick up; it was a refreshing change although I didn't jump out of my seat it was still plenty scary.I mention the music because it really does set the mood for the scenes... Especially 'old maid' which just drives home the creepiness and unstoppable nature of the thing that 'follows'; not surprisingly there were a few other people that stuck around for the credits to see who was responsible for the music. Band called Disasterpeace in case you are curious.The film has pitfalls such as how the curse or whatever you call it is transferred which I think just gets silly at some point but the horrifying aspect seems to make it worthwhile, the concept of someone just walking towards you has never concerned me and this film makes you at least temporarily question if there should be cause for concern; that's good film-making.... My only question is why was it released wide in essentially every other European country and even South Korea before being released in the U.S.?Are we not savvy enough to appreciate a film of this scope while the 'Furious 7' release is being played every 30 minutes in 5 different auditoriums at the local Google-plex?... How stupid is the premise for that film and why do we still cater to morons in this country?",9,88,177,13 April 2015
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The first half put me to sleep but the second half was just amazing!!!
",I was worried Disney would ruin this franchise but I was wrong... it's slow to get started but once it does it is positively riveting. There are a few plot-holes and if you can see your way around those you will ultimately the movie.,9,1,4,24 January 2018
Lucy," 100% not achieved
","I've been dying to see this movie since I saw the trailer as I thought 'Finally! A great summer movie' in a summer that has offered very little in the way of great movies, Lucy had the potential to be a great film but they dropped the ball... it wasn't awful but it wasn't very good either.First the parts I did like, Scarlett Johansson has some pretty sweet revenge scenes which I always like to from a female lead and she's fun to watch during some of her ECUs while she delivers her dialogue, some of the action sequences were well crafted as well and got me excited but they don't crescendo well as the level of intensity goes up then down then medium then down then high then low???? I'm no screenwriter but I'm pretty sure film school 101 tells you to just keep turning the dial up.Morgan Freeman delivers his dialogue as scripted literally... like he was reading a script to the audience, I love this actor but he doesn't seem like they paid him enough for his role in this film judging by his performance; it's almost painful to watch.100% in the review title refers to the ultimate level of brain usage Lucy achieves by the end of the movie, so what happens when you use 100% of your brain? Well apparently you develop the ability to convince the studio that produced the film that special effects should ridiculously cheesy and not even in a tongue in cheek sort of way... like the editor actually looked at these scenes and actually thought they looked good.Bottom line: 3rd rate special effects, Scarlett is fun to watch, good fight scenes, bad guys don't speak English to a fault, plot-holes, worst performance by acting great Morgan (sad face), good action sequences, good visual relays, disappointing ending.",5,8,21,31 July 2014
Godzilla," Fantastic
","Compared to the 2000 version this is epically superior, the acting is good and the size and scope of how really large Gorija or Godzilla is kept in perspective at all time; great storyline with all questions answered and very convincing special effects.You find yourself actually cheering for Godzilla through most of the movie which I think is key in that you draw a connection, I can't think of a way they could have modernized or improved the concept any better than they did; in my eyes it was flawless and I thoroughly enjoyed it.My only plight with the film was the military insistence that the only way to destroy the monsters was to use nuclear radiation which is what in fact created them to begin with, is our US military really represented to be that stupid even in film?",8,2,4,3 May 2015
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Charlies' Angels meets the Knights of the Roundtable
","Well done although there is no actual Roundtable in the film, this movie is more action based than your typical Bond film which leads me to strongly suspect it was made by mostly Americans besides the actors of course; I reference Charlies Angels for the creatively composed action scenes... tasteful use of CGI and the clever and sometimes ironic use of songs (mostly American) that play over some of the more violent scenes.The movie pokes fun at the formulaic pitfalls of typical Bond films with some tongue in cheek dialogue and presents some plot twists that really were unexpected from what I gleaned from the trailer; most everyone's back story is explained with the exception of the villains henchwomen whom I would call scissor-legs but the story of how she arrived at her present skill-set is never addressed.The fight scenes are very well choreographed.. one in particular seems at first to be a single shot until you realize the cut-away scenes of others reactions in satellite locations although they are not the Kung-Fu style I prefer such as in movies like Charlies' Angels or more recently Oldboy (American release) and more along the lines of a Jason Stathem movie but with more violent outcomes.In all it was clever, comedic, thoughtful and action packed.",8,1,7,17 February 2015
