The Avengers," One of the best movies of all time.
","I'm not a big fan of superhero movies, but watching The Avengers turned me into one. I love how they wrapped all of the separate stories/movies and combined them into one. I also like how they were able to keep all the actors and didn't need to recast. The story was pretty easy to follow and understand. It also included a lot of humor, especially from Robert Downey Jr. I was also very impressed with the special effects, especially The Hulk. The acting was also very good. All of the characters that already had their movies did a good job sticking with that characters attitude and demeanor from those movies.To sum it up, very impressed with the acting and everything else overall.",9,1,5,2 January 2014
