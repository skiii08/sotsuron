10 Cloverfield Lane," Ridiculous ending with great acting that still couldn't save it.
","I read other reviews before going to see this movie and thought this will be worth the trip. I'm delighted to say the trailer doesn't give anything away and you are in for some surprises. The movie had my attention at the very beginning and didn't take long to get me interested but then I lost it. The movie got boring and I found myself drifting off. It did pull me back a few times but not enough to feel as if I've watched a great movie, when I indeed hadn't. The actors did a great job but not enough to save the movie. Then there's the ending. I won't spoil it for anyone but when it ended the grunts and uncomfortable silence in the cinema said it all. This ending was the most hilarious disappointment I've seen in a while, I actually laughed in cinema with my daughter.. I'm so surprised at the 7.9 IMDb rating for this movie. Do yourself a favour and wait to rent it or dropbox and save your hard earned money. A so called successor to 2008's 'Cloverfield, really????",2,1,4,20 March 2016
