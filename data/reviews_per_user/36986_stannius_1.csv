Sucker Punch," wow, what a great movie
","If you like science fiction/adventure, this is just a great movie.It has a sad plot but a very good and surprising fact to tell.This movie has the most, a lot of action and power, sad story, great performance, great effects and a surprising end. A power story who has both a strong and sad story to tell.I will dare to compare this movie with Avatar and The Marix.All I can say is, wow, what a great movie.A movie that I am definitely going to watch several times.I recommend you all to take a good look at this movie.Kind regards Brian",10,9,17,2 July 2011
