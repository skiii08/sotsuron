Ford v Ferrari," Not perfect, but when it's so close, does it even matter?
","James Mangold happens to be one of my favourite directors, and not just because of what he was able to do with the Wolverine franchise. I love his ability to infuse a sense of heart into every frame. It helps that he's working with great actors and manages to coax their best performances out of them.Granted, Christian Bale's accent is all over the North of England, but ultimately it doesn't matter, because you believe him as this passionate and difficult race car driver. This is also one of Matt Damon's best performances. It's easy to see why this was nominated in 2019 for best picture because it's both crowd-pleasing and a rock-solid piece of filmmaking.The supporting cast shouldn't be discounted either. Tracy Letts, once again, turns in a stellar performance, and Jon Bernthal plays against type as Lee Iacocca and it pays off.Some may dismiss it as a 'dad' film, but for me, it's the finest 'dad' film in awhile.",10,1,2,28 March 2020
Saturday Night Fever," This sounds repetitive, but it's true.
","After reading several other comments on the film, I have to concur; the only reason to watch this film is for the dancing. The one-note, whiny plot about how hard it is to be a teenager in New York had me screaming at the screen, 'GET A LIFE, PEOPLE!' I didn't see the film until a few years ago (I was 6 when it hit the theatres, and was dying to see Travolta dance; my parents went to see it, and walked out halfway through, thoroughly disgusted),and my wife refused to sit through it after hearing how repugnant the language was. I can't honestly say that I blame her now. Like Midnight Cowboy, this film left me with a nasty taste in my mouth.   This presents a golden opportunity for Paramount when they get around to releasing this one on DVD.How about releasing a disc that (through the wonders of seamless branching) has both the PG and R rated versions on it? Not only would this appease those of us who were repulsed by the R rated version, but it would be a piece of history, a piece of nostalgia. Just a thought.....",Null,0,1,23 July 2001
12 Monkeys," My second favourite Gilliam film of all time
","This is the film that proves Gilliam's genius. Faced with budget, time and ratings restrictions, Gilliam produces a masterful version of 'La Jetee', coaxing excellent performances out of the entire cast. This is one of Willis' finest performances, and Brad Pitt's Oscar-nominated turn convinced me that he's not just another pretty face. The use of existing elements to create a vision of the future is amazing, and results in that rare breed of science fiction that doesn't rely on special effects to tell the story.I won't say anymore, because this is the type of movie that it's best to go into blind.",10,2,3,4 April 2007
Beauty and the Beast," A revelation on IMAX
","So many people have complained about the IMAX presentation of this film that I felt the need to set the record straight. I took my kids to see Beauty and the Beast at the nearest IMAX, a 2-hour drive away, and left feeling like I would never look at this film the same way again. This is a good thing, because I never had the opportunity to see the film on the big screen during its initial release. I will concede that IMAX does show up some of the flaws in the film's animation, but it also does something more important: it shows us just how much hard work goes into making an animated film, as well as how difficult it is to animate those tiny characters present in the background.The main reason I enjoyed this presentation however, was the sound. Disney went whole hog and spiffed this puppy up with a full-fledged 5.1 presentation, which serves to amplify the emotions evoked by the film. I'm not ashamed to admit that this film still makes me weep, and that emotion was not diminished in any way by the IMAX presentation. Disney has made a gallant effort with this new presentation, and I look anxiously forward to getting this one on DVD as well as seeing the IMAX presentation of 'The Lion King' next year, since it will look even better.",9,1,2,14 March 2002
Chicken Run," Nick Park and Peter Lord defy their detractors
","Chicken Run is, without question, the best movie of the summer. Nick Park and Peter Lord have proven to the world at large that a Claymation film can run longer than a short subject and still be a success. This film's evocation of the great prisoner of war movies (The Great Escape, Stalag 17) is at once stunning and hilarious. The amount of detail given in paying homage to these films gives Chicken Run its edge and its very British tone. I attended the film with my 3 year old son, who laughed hysterically in all the right places and has now officially proclaimed Chicken Run his favourite film. I was rolling in the aisles myself. Like The Iron Giant, this film disproves the Disney ethos that an animated film needs to be a musical to be a success; the only difference is that Chicken Run has the box office to show for it. Great voice-over work from all involved, an amazing amount of detail everywhere (this film screams out for repeat viewings) , and a solid script combine to create one of the most pleasurable filmgoing experiences I have ever had. Those of you who disliked the film can go on with you heads in the sand; the rest of us won't miss you.",10,0,0,6 September 2000
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," I went in with tempered expectations.....
","... and came out mildly satisfied. I had two expectations of this film: (1) that it would be somewhat better than Return of the Jedi, which I consider the worst of the original trilogy; and (2) that it wouldn't completely retcon The Last Jedi. I consider it a modest success on both counts. Without getting into spoilers, I will say that while I have some issues with how The Last Jedi was treated by this film, it didn't erase it from existence.As for the former, while there is a desire to wrap everything up with a pretty bow, it too, is somewhat tempered.So, not perfect, but better than I expected.",7,4,9,26 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Are Star Wars fans really becoming as bad as Trekkies?
","I saw Attack of the Clones with my two elder children (ages 4 and 7) on Friday, but decided to wait a couple of days and let the film sink in before commenting on it. As for what my children thought, they enjoyed it very much, my 4 year-old boy moreso than my 7 year-old girl. That being said, I must admit that I cannot compare this film to the rest of the original Star Wars trilogy, for a number of reasons. One is that the intent here seems to be different.Lucas is doing what was previously thought impossible and presenting the back story for the original trilogy in film form. As such he is having to fill in blanks that fans have used their imaginations to fill... until now. It stands to reason that there will be some opposition to this approach, as evidenced by the overall reaction to Episode I, which was pure back story. Episode II, on the other hand, plays fast and loose with ideas fans had never really thought about, such as the origin of Boba Fett, and what exactly drove Anakin Skywalker to the dark side, rather than exploring his childhood, which was admittedly a dull prospect at best. As a result, the film takes on probably the darkest tone of any SW film, Empire included. There are some scenes in this film that will send chills up your spine if you are intimately familiar with the franchise, and others that will make you stand up and cheer that the franchise has achieved its former glory. I will not go so far as to say that, but I will say at this point that this is by far the riskiest film of the franchise, in many different ways.One thing that stuck out in my mind about Episode II is Lucas' attempts to better develop his characters, which goes back to the whole back story idea I was talking about. Rather than the snapshot we get of Luke, Leia, et al in Eps. 4, 5, & 6, Lucas is laying bare the progression of these characters for the whole world to see, something that could not happen in the comparatively short timeline of the later episodes. It is an effort that deserves to be commended. Now, on to the detractors of Episode II; to those who say that Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman are wooden compared to the rest of the cast, especially in the love scenes: did you forget how stiff Hamill, Ford, and Fisher were in the first film? These newer actors have yet to develop the rapport that the others possessed for the rest of the saga. Some woodenness is to be expected, and Hamill et al were criticised for the same thing at the time of the original films' release. Next up: those who are begging Lucas to bring Larry Kasdan back to write Episode III. The person responsible for the crackling dialogue between Han and Leia in Empire (and believe me, of any of the films, Empire has the best lines) was the late Leigh Brackett; Kasdan was brought in to finish the screenplay when she died, and the film he wrote completely on his own, Return of the Jedi, gave Luke, among others, some of the lamest lines in cinematic history. Finally, to those of you who fault the pacing of this one (meaning Ep II), remember 1) it's back story; the pacing is going to be slack because of the sheer amount of time it covers, and 2) the best paced episode is still Empire, because of Irvin Kershner's wealth of experience as an action director.What I'm getting at is simply this: you are trying to make Attack of the Clones compete with a memory, and since memory is subjective, imperfect, and reconstructive, anything new just isn't going to be able to compete. aprreciate the film for what it is, which is a snapshot of a filmmaker's maturation, which is a difficult and painful process. Aren't you glad I managed to get through this without any spoilers?",8,0,0,21 May 2002
The Nightmare Before Christmas," The Grinch gets outdone!
","This is a personal favourite. Although credited to Henry Selick, Burton's fingerprints are all over this, and like most Burton films, it gets better with repeat viewings. My only quibble with the video version is the opening narration. I can't remember exactly, but the narration on the soundtrack CD is by Patrick Stewart, and is vastly superior and more extensive than what is contained in the VHS version, and I seem to remember that Stewart's narration is contained in the theatrical release. Oh well, it doesn't detract too severely from the film, which is so subversive and twisted as to make 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' look like a fairy tale. Here we have a dark protagonist who wants to appropriate Christmas not because he wants to make the world as miserable as he, but because he thinks he can make it better. His misguided attempts to bring Christmas to the masses in his own unique way are so blackly funny, and such a refreshing change from the commercialistic style of the Santa Claus myth, that when he is ultimately thwarted, we feel sad that he didn't succeed; not because we're sick and degenerate, but because the current children's Christmas myth is so stifling, we all feel it could use a good kick in the pants. The Grinch cops out on this level and turns into a complete cheeseball. Long live Jack Skellington, and may his follies cause us to reexamine our own Christmas traditions.",9,2,4,4 November 1999
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," I had my doubts, but...
","Tim Burton has absolutely nailed this film. Granted, he does add a subplot that was not in the novel, but I was amazed by how closely he stuck to the book with this latest adaptation. Some big changes were made from the 1971 film, but the vast majority of them were in the book to begin with. I was particularly tickled with the inclusion of the Prince Pondicherry story.The verdict on Depp as Wonka? It gets better with repeat viewings. The reports of his character being based on Michael Jackson simply don't ring true, as he comes across more as a children's show host with a sadistic streak.Probably the most substantial difference between this film and 1971's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is the focus, which is rightfully returned to Charlie Bucket. Charlie has more depth in this film and gives you more reason to root for him. Peter Ostrum was fine in 1971, but was constrained by the limits of the script. Freddie Highmore does much better, but largely because he's given more to do. The rest of the cast is spot-on as well, and the family dynamic (largely absent from WW&TCF) gives this film an altogether different dimension.In short, I really liked the 1971 film, and it's still difficult to choose between the two, but I have to give the edge to Charlie, largely because it hews more closely to how I imagined the book when I read it as a child.",9,0,3,1 March 2006
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," The Potter saga returns to form
","I was very pleasantly surprised by Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. The book is a tough slog and actually reads very much like a screenplay, so I was curious to see how it would be handled in film form. I have seen the film in both conventional and IMAX 3D versions and found Order of the Phoenix to be the best HP film since Prisoner of Azkaban. This is no paint-by-numbers adaptation like the first two films, nor is it a profound departure from the original text, like Goblet of Fire. Director David Yates and writer Michael Goldenberg, both of whom are new to the franchise, have simply pared the story to its basic elements and built up from there, to excellent effect. Aiding them in their quest to create a Harry Potter 'movie' is the phenomenal performance of Imelda Staunton, who exudes the right amount of creepiness as the sickly-sweet-with bitter-aftertaste Dolores Umbridge. I may never want to see pink and kittens in any combination again.The rest of the cast is also in fine form, with Michael Gambon continuing to make Dumbledore his own, and Daniel Radcliffe balancing teen angst with pathos in a performance miles removed from his earlier work in the franchise. The angst is more easily sympathised with here. I recommend this to anyone remotely curious, and also recommend the IMAX version, as it makes the conflicts in the film more palpable.",8,0,0,23 July 2007
The Mummy Returns," Great fun at the movies!
","I, like a lot of others, had read the reviews and decided to take them with a pinch of salt since most of the same critics had drubbed the first one as well. My instincts proved correct; this movie is an awful lot of fun, the way the relationship evolved between Rick and Evie was great, and their son was an absolute hoot; not irritating like most child stars. The effects are already leaps and bounds ahead of Sommers' first Mummy, and I found the action to be breathtaking rather than overwhelming. To the critic who said it was like watching a videogame over someone's shoulder-- Did we see the same movie? Other great things about this one-- the Rock was perfect as the Scorpion King, despite his limited screen time, and I absolutely loved Patricia Velasquez as the reincarnation of Anck-su-Namun. This is definitely one case in which to ignore the critics completely and enjoy. I know I did.",9,0,0,27 May 2001
Army of Darkness," A cult movie that lives up to its reputation.
","I LOVE this movie! I have yet to see the other 2 installments in the trilogy in their entirety, but I can already tell that this is my favourite. I first saw it on video in '94 and was laughing pretty hard. I saw it again last year and was pleasantly surprised. It holds up well to repeat viewings. Some viewers complain about Bruce's acting style, but it's totally in character with the rest of the film. As a bonus, we're treated to an early glimpse of Embeth Davidtz, who of course went on to Schindler's List and a turn in another great subversive film, Matilda. The homage to Ray Harryhausen in the finale is great. I had a friend complain to me that the special effects in the movie were great up until the Deadite battle, which he considered cheesy. I think he missed the point. This is a fun movie, pure and simple. Sam has moved on to bigger things, and turned into a 'serious' director, which is a shame. The industry needs less serious directors and more inventive visual stylists, of which Sam is one of a dying breed. It's a pity.",10,1,1,14 October 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," If Episode II is this good, I can't wait
","This one will always be my personal favourite of the original Star Wars Trilogy, mostly because it is the best. Everything really came together here; so much so, that even George Lucas didn't change that much for the Special Edition, and what he did change only served to enhance the greatness that was already there. Probably the most notable difference between this one and the original Star Wars was in the writing, by the late Leigh Brackett and the then-neophyte Lawrence Kasdan. Brackett had a great way with a putdown, but not to the point of simply being snarky. Lines like 'I'd just as soon kiss a Wookie!'' I can easily arrange that; you could use a good kiss!' serve as punctuation, and not the entire point of the film. This is why irony is dying its currently slow and painful death: a lack of skill and judgement in the use of insults, sarcasm, and other putdowns. This film has the great banter of an old Bogart-Bacall film, which also gave it an edge back in 1980, when so few intelligent films were being released. When the best banter of the year is coming from a space opera, that's pretty dire, but I digress. To critics of my point of view, yes this film is a downer, but that's what makes it so great. As the middle act, it shouldn't have a happy ending, and that's what will be so cool about Episodes II and III. We know the new trilogy is going to end on a down note, but like Titanic, we can't help but watch. If the plot mechanics operate in any way like they did in Empire, it's going to be a good time at the movies.",10,0,0,29 November 2000
