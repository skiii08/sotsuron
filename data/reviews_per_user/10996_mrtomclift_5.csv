The King's Speech," A tale of friendship, family and the beauty of language
","In 1924, the new invention of radio gives King George V his first opportunity to address his people all around the world. For the monarch and his subjects, it is a great and historic moment; for his second son, Prince Albert Duke of York, it is a nightmare. Albert, or 'Bertie' as he is referred to by his family, suffers from a crippling stammer, one that makes his duties at court difficult, and the task of public speaking nearly impossible. In desperation, his wife Duchess Elizabeth reaches out to Lionel Logue, an Australian speech therapist living in London, whose unorthodox methods may be the future king's final hope. The subject matter may seem low-key, and the stakes likewise rather minuscule, but director Tom Hooper, with the considerable help of his first rate cast, turns this seemingly unremarkable real life tale of a stuttering king into a film filled with emotion and gentle humour, and one that is an absolute pleasure to watch.Although The King's Speech is set in the world of royalty, the heart of the film deals with far less grandiose, far more human themes. Early sequences introduce us to the Prince and his loving wife and young daughters, while the eventual friendship between the stammering monarch and his quirky doctor forms the backbone of the plot. Amusing and often very touching, scenes like these are also lent an intimate feel thanks to the films warm cinematography and production design; by contrast, low angles and elaborate formal costumes dominate scenes of regality, making it easy to understand why Bertie feels so intimidated and overwhelmed. In every scene, Hooper is able to capture, with sometimes just a single shot, the tone of the setting. Likewise, Alexandre Desplat beautiful score imbues the film with a charm and grace in some moments, majesty and circumstance in others.The acting in The King's Speech is uniformly superb. Obvious difficulties of affecting a speech impediment aside, Firth's work as the stammering King is spectacularly moving, sympathetic and filled with relatable frustration. Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter are almost as impressive – the former is endlessly likable as Lionel Logue, while Carter plays her role as Bertie's wife the Duchess of York with the perfect combination of love, restraint and the slightest of superiority. Beyond these leading three, Guy Pierce and Michael Gambon are both believable and intensely unpleasant as the sniveling Prince of Wales and the domineering George V, and the rest of the cast is filled out nicely by veteran British character actors including Derek Jacobi and Timothy Spall.The King's Speech has already been labeled by some as typical awards-bait; the kind of formulaic dramatic picture that Academy members can safely vote for over more energetic or perhaps interesting films. Admitedly, there are one or two lines of dialogue that felt a little overly inspirational, and a few character decisions that seem to serve drama rather than common sense (as well as a rather glaring plot flaw that, had any characters acknowledged it, would have rendered the tension in the climax non-existent). However, these moments are few and far between, and although the film may prove the easy choice come Oscar night, that seems an unfair criticism to level against the men and woman who strived to make this film such a good one. And as a tale of friendship, family and the beauty of language, The King's Speech is certainly that.",8,0,1,13 January 2011
Black Swan," Ferocious psychological filmmaking at its finest
","While from a distance ballet may look like it is filled with elegance and grace, in reality ballerinas must possess incredible strength, flexibility and unwavering dedication if they wish to succeed in such a physically demanding profession. It is therefore not so surprising that the latest film from director Darren Aronofsky focuses on a New York ballet company and their performance of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. From washed up wrestlers to reclusive mathematicians, Spanish conquistadors and Coney Island drug addicts, all of Aronofsky's films – π, Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain and The Wrestler – have been centered around characters who become dangerously, singularly obsessed. In Black Swan, the character is Nina, a shy, timorous young dancer played magnificently by Natalie Portman. Her fixation? The leading role of The Swan Queen. Filled with nightmarish intensity, gripping melodrama, steamy eroticism and occasional camp, Black Swan is a captivating tale of a woman consumed by her quest for perfection, and a visceral cinematic experience from one of the true visionary directors of today.Swan Lake, the story of a princess transformed by an evil sorcerer into a beautiful white swan, is one of the most famed ballets in history. It's most interesting aspect is that its lead ballerina is required to dance two parts; the graceful white swan, as well as the sultry black swan, the seductress who steals the white swans love. For Nina, the role represents her shot at stardom, as well as the chance to finally prove herself to her domineering mother (Barbara Hershey), a woman whose overbearing personality has trapped Nina is a state of perpetual childhood. Nina's innocence however, is soon to be shattered. Forced to contend with the jealousy of her fellow dancers, the sexual advances of the company's lecherous director (Vincent Cassel) and the enormous pressures of perfecting her technique, Nina grasp on reality begins to slip. Haunted by terrifying hallucinations, her paranoia is given form in the appearance of Lily, a beautiful and uninhibited new dancer who represents everything the obsessive, sexually repressed Nina is not.Natalie Portman has always been a solid performer, but her work in Black Swan is indisputably a career best. The feelings of fear and pain that Nina experiences – both mental and physical – are palpable in this all-encompassing performance, one that demands of Portman both the utmost emotional expression and a physicality every bit as straining as Mickey Rourke's in Aronofksy's previous film, The Wrestler. Once again, this masterful pulls back the curtain to reveal the hidden agonies of performance as entertainment; in Black Swan, ballet is portrayed not as art but as near torture, the excruciating physical feats Nina attempts depicted with a sickening, gut-wrenching realism. The emotional abuse Nina suffers at the hands of her coworkers, director and psychopathic mother is similarly horrifying, so much so that even at the beginning of the film, her psychosis is already beginning to peek through. Portman's transformation, through fear and madness, from the quiet and dainty dancer Nina was – her mother's 'sweet girl' – to the furious, powerful, sexually eruptive creature she becomes by the films end, is utterly enthralling to behold.The technical prowess Aronofsky displays in this film is quite simply incredible. The use of stark digital cinematography irritated me at first, but as the film progressed I soon reevaluated my initial impressions. This is a gritty, claustrophobic film, and the inelegant visual aesthetic is an essential part of the movies tone, be it in its portrayal of dance, sex or paranoid dreams. As Nina's mind begins to descent further into madness, her disturbing hallucinations, full of images of self-harm, bodily transformation and erotic decadence, all feel graphically, often frighteningly real. The film's production design is also terrific; a single look at Nina's bedroom tells you everything you need to know about her character and home environment. Likewise, in almost every scene a mirror is present, reflecting the dual nature of Nina's role and personality, both of which threaten to destroy her. These and other motifs did strike me as a tad obvious, but ultimately Black Swan is less concerned with avoiding clichés as it is with the establishment of a dark and thrilling atmosphere; in this regard, it is almost perfect.Speaking of atmosphere, the use of sound in Black Swan is absolutely astounding. Clint Mansell has scored every one of Aronofsky's films, and between Requiem for the Dream and The Fountain has crafted some of the best and most iconic film music of all time. Compared to his work on those films, the Black Swan score is far less bombastic; instead, Mansell reinforces moments of fear, triumph, eroticism and despair with precise classical pieces, often incorporating themes from Tchaikovsky's magnificent ballet into his own original tracks. Indeed, by the films frantic and operatic end, it is impossible to tell where Mansell's work ends and Tchaikovsky's begins – the main theme from Swan Lake is used to spectacular effect in the movies climax. Even better than the score however is the film's incredibly evocative sound design. Aronofsky incorporates the noises of cracking bones, heavy breathing, rustling feathers and shattering glass to create an air of constant unease and occasional terror; the subsequent blend of music, sound and striking visuals is heady and intoxicating.In the hands of lesser talent, Black Swan could easily have been a total mess. There are elements within this script, and even within some of the performances (most notably Barbara Hershey's), that would have fitted easily into a day time soap opera or cheesy eighties horror film. Instead, under the technical precession of Darren Aronofsky, and lead by a flooring performance from Natalie Portman, this film is a near masterpiece, one that draws you in with its dark sensuality and twisted, uncontainable energy. This is ferocious psychological filmmaking at its finest.",9,2,4,13 January 2011
Drag Me to Hell," A repulsive, over the top tour de force
","Christine Brown is a loan officer who, in her quest for a promotion, refuses to extend the loan of the elderly Mrs. Ganush. Unfortunately for her, Mrs Ganush turns out to be a gypsy, and as a consequence of her greed, Christine finds herself tormented by a demon, the Lamia, who unless sated within three days will drag her to the depths of hell. Thus begins Drag Me To Hell, the latest film from Sam Raimi, the director behind two massively popular trilogies. Most people will be more familiar with his recent work at the helm of the Spiderman series, but hardcore movie fans such as myself have far fonder memories of a little franchise called The Evil Dead. Incredibly bloody and incredibly silly, those low budget schlock fests are huge cult favourites, and are considered by many cine-buffs to be amongst the greatest horror comedies of all time. Drag Me To Hell is Raimi's return to the genre that made his name, and is every bit as funny and frightening as his reputation would suggest it should be.Put plainly, this movie is utterly absurd. It's being marketed as a straight horror film, but nothing could be further from the truth. Just consider the premise for a second: a demon is being denied a mortgage extension! In reality, Drag Me To Hell is a cheesy, gratuitous horror comedy filled with intentionally dodgy special effects, more gross out gags than you can shake a stick at, and, at one point, a talking goat. After the disappointment that was Spiderman 3, it's good to see Raimi at the top of his game once more; it's been fifteen years since Army of Darkness (the third Evil Dead film), but from the opening scene of this movie fans will recognize his signature campy style. The camera work is a testament to B-movies; the quick zooms and slow tilts are glorious to behold. The movie is gross hell, although in hindsight it's actually not that bloody. Instead, Raimi uses a bevy of other thing to disgust his audience and torment his protagonist – maggots, bile, flies, eyeballs – take you pick! But as well as being hilarious, Drag Me To Hell is also at times legitimately frightening. I am a big fan of classic horror, but in recent years I have found myself bemoaning the lack of decent entries in this Saw dominated era. Maybe it's just me, but I find little entertaining about watching people get tortured for two hours – it's not scary, nor is it any fun. My favourite horror films have always been a mixture of horror and comedy; aside from the Evil Dead films, movies like Child's Play or Scream or even Gremlins (that movie is PG, but it's still far scarier and more suspenseful than anything from Eli Roth). Drag Me To Hell reminds me of films like these; slow suspenseful build followed by a jump scare. It's good to see the old tropes in use again, things like shadows, the wind and thunder. At the same time, Raimi completely subverts the whole idea of a jump scare, using items like a phone or a handkerchief to provide the shock. This is not the kind of scary movie that will leave you with nightmares, but while you're watching it you certainly get your money's worth.I should point out that fans of Evil Dead will enjoy this movie on a whole other level. Drag Me To Hell is filled with homage's and references to that trilogy, so much so that many scenes could be have been lifted out and inserted directly into Evil Dead 2. Come to think of it, my only real complaint about this movie is that there was no Bruce Campbell cameo! But even those who have never seen a Raimi movie before can still have a hell of a lot of fun. All in all, Drag Me To Hell is hands down one of the most entertaining horror films I have seen since I first saw the original Evil Dead. Funny when it wants to be, scary when it needs to be and stupendously campy throughout, this film is a repulsive, over the top tour de force, and a return to form for Sam Raimi, the master of excessive horror.",9,3,6,13 January 2011
Up," surpasses even WALL-E in terms of adventure, beauty and human emotion
","Pixar Animation Studios have always been in a league of their own, both in the quality of their animation and the superiority of their storytelling. It's almost unfair to compare recent kid's films such as Kung Fu Panda or Shrek - both of them decent movies in their own right - to the likes of Finding Nemo or The Incredibles, movies that put to shame anything being produced by rival studios. Then of course, last year, we saw WALL-E, a quantum leap forward from what was already a splenderously high level of standards. That film made me and many others reevaluate what a modern children's film could be, and left us wondering if Pixar would ever be able to replicate that level of success. Up is the film that proves not only that they can replicate that success, but better it. It is a film that blends the best parts of all of Pixar's previous films, and yet somehow manages to be utterly unique, and utterly wonderful. It is not only my favourite film of 2009, but my favourite Pixar film of all time, surpassing even WALL-E in terms of adventure, beauty and human emotion.The story begins with a shy young boy, Carl Fredricksen, bonding with an outgoing young girl named Ellie over their mutual dreams of exploring the world. The pair fall in love, marry, and grow old together â€“ a journey that is outlined in a gorgeous dialogue-free montage near the beginning of the film. The way a lifetime of love is communicated so beautifully using just music and images in this sequence in awe-inspiring, and if I had one complaint of Up, it would be that after such a superb first act, the film never quite manages to reach such insurmountable heights again. But I wouldn't trade those scenes for anything in the world; the emotional effect that Ellie's passing has on both Carl and the audience is incredible, and within ten minutes of the film starting I literally had tears in my eyes.Carl, now a seventy-eight year old widower, lives alone, filled with regret about having never travelled to South America with his beloved Ellie. But after a run in with the law leaves him facing life in an aged care facility, Carl decides to go the adventure he never had. In another one of the films stunning visual set pieces, Carl attaches tens of thousands of helium balloons to his house and flies off to Paradise Falls in the jungles of Venezuela. His sabbatical is somewhat complicated however when he discovers that Russell, a plucky ten year old wilderness explorer, has stowed away aboard his house. Without giving away too much of the story, the duo end up pitted against a villainous old explorer, humorous hi-jinks ensue, and with the help of this unlikely friend, Carl finally learns to overcome his grief.The beauty of the animation in this film is simply indescribable. Gorgeous, stunning, mesmerising; I can throw around all the synonyms I want, but you truly cannot appreciate it until you see it for yourself. There are so many individual moments throughout this film that could be frozen, framed, and hung on the wall of an art gallery for all to see. But it's more than that. These aren't just empty pictures to be analysed; there is true feeling behind every frame. We feel as though we have been with Carl his entire life, experiencing each of his emotions for ourselves. Such is the level of storytelling in this film that two worn armchairs sitting next to each can be as memorable an image as the sight of a thousand balloons floating against the crimson backdrop of a rising sun.Where I think Up truly trumps WALL-E is in its sense of fun. Say whatever you like about that movies stunning visuals and thought provoking themes, at the end of the day a lot of those things are going to go straight over small children's heads. While Up is undoubtedly as mature and intelligent a film as any of Pixar's previous works, it is also a rip roaring comic adventure that kids are going to love. Maybe you could argue that this film gets a little silly as it goes on, but I think it's ridiculous to hold that against what is, at its core, a movie for primary schoolers. With Up, I believe Pixar have found the perfect match of emotional maturity and light hearted entertainment, and because of this, kids who love this film when they're five years old are going to be able to come back in ten, twenty, thirty years and enjoy it all the more.Up is one of those rare movies that can be enjoyed by everyone, be you young, old or in between. It is entertaining, with a great story, terrific characters and heart warming message. It is funny, and manages to be so without having to resort to flatulence humour or inane pop-culture references. It is moving, capturing the full range of human emotions with inexplicable ease and captivating grace. It is one of the most beautiful, memorable, touching films I have ever had the privilege of watching. That much, I can explain with words. But words, as this movie proves, can only do so much. So if you want to understand how I truly feel about this film, go and experience it for yourself.",10,1,3,13 January 2011
The Fighter," A cliché but never the less effective boxing drama
","Prior to last week, the only film of David O. Russell's that I had seen was Three Kings, an energetically shot heist film set during the closing days of the gulf war. That movie – one of my all time favourites – is a unique blend of black comedy, drama and political satire, as well as an action movie that consistently subverts the stereotypes that pervade so many of its Hollywood compatriots. Based on my love for that film, the idea of Russell directing a boxing drama in The Fighter was extremely enticing – after all, what genre is more primed for a sly deconstruction than the one that houses six Rocky movies? Unfortunately, Russell's latest effort more or less toes its generic line, with hardly any of the rebellious spark that made Three Kings so exciting. That's not to say The Fighter isn't good; it is. At times, it is truly triumphant, combining rousing fight scenes with effective family drama, and containing one of the most flabbergasting performances of the season. Yet in spite of all this, as I exited the theatre, I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed.Perhaps my dissatisfaction lies in the films very premise, one that feels strikingly familiar to the many boxing films that came before it, and one that is made no less trite by the fact that it is based on a true story. A muscle-bound Mark Wahlberg plays Mickey 'Irish' Ward, a welterweight boxer from the blue collar neighbourhood of Lowell, Massachusetts. Despite his talent, Mickey seems destined to remain a stepping stone; a man for other fighters to defeat on their way to bigger and better things. His lack of success is due in no small part to the machinations of his horrid family, which includes a parasitic mother who is also his agent, a drug addicted half-brother who is also his trainer, and an enormous number of freeloading sisters who all rely on the money Mickey's fights bring in. On the verge of quitting, Mickey is offered one last shot at stardom, but only on the condition that his family remains uninvolved.As I said, The Fighter is good, and all of the above makes for some often compelling cinematic drama. Ultimately however, the blending of dysfunctional families and underdog fighters is nothing that hasn't been handled better in films like Raging Bull or The Wrestler, both of which also feature lead characters far more interesting than Mickey Ward. Neither does David O. Russell offer enough directorial flair – barring one or two individual moments – to make the movie-making distinct. Too often, the director falls back on the old standard of the training montage, in this case inexplicably set to popular nineties rock music. None of this is enough to cripple the film, but I have a hard time imagining wanting to revisit The Fighter when it offers very little that I haven't seen done better before. One thing I will give it credit for are the boxing scenes; magnificently staged, Russell and Wahlberg really highlight the brutality and primal excitement of the sport.If the movie is at all transcendent, it is in the realm of its performances. Mark Wahlberg is a notoriously hit and miss actor, but his work in The Fighter is definitely amongst his best. Melissa Leo is expectedly terrific as Mickey's intensely dislikable mother, and it's great to see the so often typecast Amy Adams playing outside her usual element as Mickey's love interest, a working-class woman with a few battle scars of her own. But not one of these performers can hold a candle to Christian Bale as the squirrelly, drug-addled Dick Eklund. The Fighter marks the third time (after The Machinist and Rescue Dawn ) that Bale has shed massive amounts of weight for a part, a feat that reflects his absolute dedication to this role. Sporting a Boston accent that renders him almost unintelligible, Bale's work is the reason to see this film, and one can't help but suspect that the reason O. Russell inserted footage of the real life Dick Eklund into the films end credits was so audience members could see how spot-on Bale really is.The Fighter is a good movie, and one that is definitely worth seeing. My disappointment comes mostly from unreal expectations, born both of my love for Three Kings and of the enormous hype that has surrounded this film; a hype that, despite me liking the movie, feels largely overblown. It is also perhaps a disappointment born of having seen one too many boxing movies, many of which I ultimately prefer over this one. But I'll be the first to acknowledge that just because a movie isn't original doesn't mean it can't be good. And at the end of the day, be it the drama, the boxing or the mind-blowing performance from Bale, there is very little about The Fighter that doesn't work.",7,1,1,26 January 2011
