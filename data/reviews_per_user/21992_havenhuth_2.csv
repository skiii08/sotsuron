Ford v Ferrari," Damon v Bale
","Matt Damon and Christian Bale both gave terrific performances, but I felt like the movie was lacking something throughout. In a movie about trying to build the world's fastest car they never show anyone actually build a car. It sets up a problem and then cuts immediately to the solution. I also feel like the ending is 20 minutes too long.",3,13,35,28 November 2019
Jojo Rabbit," And the award goes to........
","This movie was BRILLIANT! Taika Waititi has proven himself as one of the greatest storytellers of his generation. There were two parts that made the movie for me, when he just jumped out the window for no reason, and when he was wearing the Native American head dress. The entire time he was wearing it, there was no reference or explanation to it....COMEDY GOLD! The cast was amazing, Scarlett Johanson and Sam Rockwell deliver Oscar worthy performances. I can not recommend this movie enough!",10,3,9,6 December 2019
