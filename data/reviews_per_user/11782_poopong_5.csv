Lucky Number Slevin," best this year so far
","What a movie! like a strange cross between usual suspects/ lock stock and layer cake. and a great cast too. Sir Ben Kingsley, Morgan Freeman, Bruce Willis, Josh Hartnett and Lucy Liu looking sooo cute, playing an innocent girl, no kicking or punching just being cute. The whole cast is great, really played with gusto. It is a case of mistaken identity, Josh Harnett is in NY visiting a pal of his and is taken away by one mob boss then when he gets home another one grabs him. So he has to think of things fast to stay alive. more twists and turns than the Alton Towers Corkscrew.Just minted, but stay focused or you may miss sommit",10,2,10,8 March 2006
The Longest Yard," entertaining remake
","The storyline is the same as the original and the UK version (all be it about proper football not the American version ;) ) but how it gets from beginning to end is very good.Adam Sandler is not playing his usual moaning character who shouts a lot and grumbles at everything (he does once or twice but thats it) and has some great one liners, the person who steals the show is Chris rock, fantastic. A lot of very funny moments, good characters and a bunch of the hardest looking people you are likely to see! It is a popcorn flick in the true sense of the phrase, you wont need to think hard through this film but it will entertain you.",7,1,3,20 September 2005
Men in Black II," Pants
","It was pants!! worse than the first one, it made me chuckle........not laugh.....about 4 times.  The best bits are in the trailer!!  I have not recommended this to anyone, not even to wait for it on video.  I was looking forward to this film for ages, but it was such a let down!! PLEASE DO NOT GO AND SEE IT!!",Null,0,0,13 August 2002
Casino Royale," Craig..Daniel Craig goes in @ #2
","From the opening black and white sequence to the end (bar the crap theme tune) the film was firing on all possible cylinders.Daniel Craig was superb, Bond is a killer, and Craig looked like he could kill. Looks like the Sean Connery Bond, you could believe he could kill whilst Roger Moore could only raise an eyebrow. Mr Brosnan has gone to #3 but he was a good bond too - when he killed Electra in the world is not enough you believed he was a glorified hit-man.But back to Casino Royale. No Q branch and no miss moneypenny - although a quick sly nod to her in one scene. Aston Martin was back, thank goodness they got rid of the damn beemers in the last one! there was no gadgets which was a good thing as in the book there was none either. Talking of Ian Flemings 1st Spy novel, the film stayed true, although the baddies were updated to be world terrorists and instead of playing the card game baccarat we saw Bond pit his wits in high stake Texas Hold 'em which again is an update to current times.There was never a dull moment in the film, cant wait to see the next one!",10,2,4,21 November 2006
