Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Precise and to the point
","I thought Episode 1 was a pretty good Star Wars flick and it did present a few surprises and setups for the coming episodes. The saber battles were especially good (especially the climax battle between Qui Gonn Jinn and Darth Maul and Obi Wan).Although Lucas does seem to be flashing big time effects at us every minute he can, it does add to the film, though I miss the use of miniatures rather than big effects. Still, it doesn't overshadow the story much. With the added special effects Queen Amidala's hair pieces, the movie was amazing. John Williams once again added to the mesmerizing score which always adds to the scenes. And Jar Jar Binks was good as the clumsy comic relief for the picture and Little Anakin was given a great beginning before his turn to the dark side.I await with great anticipation for the next film and can't wait to see the beginning of Amidala and Anakin's relationship grow even more. 3 more years! We've waited 15 years for episode 1. We can survive 3 more years. May the collecting begin...",5,0,0,20 May 1999
The Hurricane," Worthy of an Oscar
","I agree with all the intelligent people who saw The Hurricane as a movie about the human spirit and courage. I just wanted to point out to a previous reviewer that the young black boy, Lesra, who reached out to Carter did exist. One would know this: a) if he/she didn't criticize immediately without finding out facts, and b) common sense (how would Carter's story have been told if the book he wrote wasn't picked up...the word 'duh' comes to mind) This movie is different from Raging Bull, not stealing from it, because it is an intense drama depicting the life of a black boxer wrongly accused of murder. It is a story in its own category which should have gotten more publicity and push for the academies, but American Beauty was pushed (AB had Oscar talk waaay before it even hit the theaters, kinda fishy, isn't it?)The cop may not have existed but there have been facts that show there were more than one involved in the plot of destruction against Carter. The cop was named 'overvillified.' Believe it or not there are people like that in this world, and even more worse than he was portrayed (watch Rosewood another true story.) I notice a few who are saying some things are 'too good to be true' but believe it or not truth is stranger than fiction and alot of times the truth does hurt.This is a compelling film and a look at how blacks (even celebrities) were treated during the civil rights movement (notice footage from the television and Carter not winning the medal over the white boxer). Its seen through the eyes of Carter himself and although it may be 'bias' as some people believe, if it was seen through the criminals, would it not be biased as well? After all, the movie is called THE HURRICANE. Not the people who convicted the Hurricane. Although it did leave out some key factors of the trial, it doesn't hurt to pick up the book and read more on it, does it? After all, the length of a film is the length of a short story and a book could definitely not be told in a 2 hour plus movie as it would a mini series.Overall, The Hurricane is a powerful film that goes into character rather than plot. It is definitely a character driven film so if your looking for the complete historical view that the movie may have missed go check out: Hurricane: The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter by James S. Hirsch, Lazarus and the Hurricane : The Freeing of Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter by Sam Chaiton, Terry Swinton  or The 16th Round : From Number 1 Contender by Ruben Carter himself.",Null,0,2,29 July 2000
