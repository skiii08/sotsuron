The Devil's Advocate," Filtered-through-Hollywood morality tale has its moments.
","New York lawyers are actually demons from hell! It's not hard to imagine and a great idea for a movie, but this adaptation of Andrew Neiderman's (more involving) novel is only partly successful, despite the A-list collaboration. So-so allegorical tale follows shallow hotshot Florida lawyer Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves), who hasn't lost a case, and his beautiful young wife Mary Ann (Charlize Theron) to a prestigious NY law firm. Kevin is instantly taken under the wing of seductive head honcho John Milton (Al Pacino) and seduced by more than just the money, but the lack of decent morals are a turnoff and his simple-minded wife has an even more miserable time of it. It's because Pacino is actually Satan!The greed-isn't-good theme is old hat, and like Mike Nichol's WOLF, it borrows a lot of vintage horror film ideas, but dodges genre identification. Reeves is better than expected, but still never wholly convincing in a role that requires a stronger actor and Pacino fans will have to have patience, because he's completely restrained until the finale finally lets him rant and rave. Theron is most impressive as the troubled wife...the main victim of the manipulation and real horrors of the story (and a real cutie, besides). Rick Baker, Rob Bottin and Steve Wang worked on the scantily-used special effects.",7,1,2,9 July 2003
Requiem for a Dream," The harrowing effects of drug addiction.
","First off, this is not a perfect film. It's flawed, it's manipulative, the quick-cut editing and garish visuals are kind of a way of dressing up an oft told tale, it often exploits its subject matter and is never quite the breakthrough that Aronofsky's 'Pi' was. However, that said, it does exactly what it sets out to do--horrify audiences with scary and nightmarish visions of a culture mostly dependent on addiction in one form or another. If ever there was an anti-drug film or a film preaching against substance abuse, this is it, but it doesn't really limit iself to just one type of addiction is you pay attention. I agree that it should be mandatory viewing for teenagers, but the MPAA stupidly slapped an NC-17 rating on Aronofsky's vision...so much for a 'message' movie breaking through to the people it would most likely help.The Academy Awards should be downright embarrassed for awarding Julia Roberts the Best Actress award for 'Erin Brockovich.' Roberts slaps on a push-up bra, shows her cleavage and pouts a lot and that's the extent of her performance (the woman just has little acting range). Burstyn blows her out of the water, supporting nearly the entire emotional weight of this film on her shoulders, but how can she compete with 'America's sweetheart' finally doing a film with the slightest hint of substance? I don't get why Roberts won and neither does any other competent human being, but my hunch is that she was being rewarded for her beauty, charm and the fact she brings in so much money for film studios. So what, right? The award is for the best performance and you simply will not see a better performance than Burstyn's here. They also skipped out on nominating Jennifer Connelly, who's just excellent in support as lead Jared Leto's girlfriend reduced to turning tricks for a high. She's much more naturally beautiful than Roberts, but has thus far in her career, pretty much refused to sell out to Hollywood and has taken some pretty risky roles. That's really admirable and I look forward to seeing her in other things. And I should also note that Marlon Wayans proves he deserves to act in better movies than SCARY MOVIE.",8,0,1,15 March 2002
World War Z," A PG-13 zombie film for the masses
","WORLD WAR Z is the largest-budgeted (190 million +) summer blockbuster- style film featuring zombies to date. According to Box Office Mojo, it is also by far the highest-grossing zombie film here in the U.S.; beating its closest competition ZOMBIELAND (2007) by well over 100 million dollars. Let's face it: hype sells tickets. Throw in a known A- List star and that's even more tickets. Quality doesn't even really matter at the end of the day as long as you have the funds to promote the hell out of something. Unfortunately for WWZ, all of the money, expensive PR, CGI effects, online-generate hype and star power in the world can't save this from being an average, by-the-numbers, utterly forgettable film with an ordinary screenplay. It also can't change the fact there have already been literally hundreds of zombie films made for a tiny fraction of what this film cost (many made well under 1 million dollars) that wipe the floor with this one in every way possible.Brad Pitt (also one of the producers) stars as Gerry Lane, a retired UN operative who now enjoys staying home and making pancakes for his family. Aw, ain't he sweet? The open 25 minutes is centered around Pitt and his family's attempt to flee to safety once the zombie outbreak begins. These scenes are more-or-less rendered almost unwatchable thanks to the presence of Gerry's two irritating daughters. While pandemonium is erupting around them, these shrill little abortions take turns annoying us by 1. screaming repeatedly for their blanket, 2. taking off a seat belt during a high speed car ride and refusing to put it back on, 3. shrieking at the top of their lungs because they've dropped a stuffed animal, 4. gasping over an asthma attack and then being perfectly fine a scene later before even receiving medication, 5. wandering off in the middle of zombie attacks for no apparent reason. After a pit stop at an apartment building, Gerry uses his connections to get a copter lift to safety and thankfully wifey (Mireille Enos) and the girls are put on the back burner, having served their purpose of showing what an upstanding guy Gerry is. The film does briefly return to them a time or two to show things like one of the brat daughter's whining and complaining about the food and water they're being served. If this is the future, maybe a zombie epidemic isn't a bad thing after all.Now on an overly-crowded Navy ship with limited supplies, Gerry is pretty much forced into accompanying a young Harvard virologist and a military unit to search for the cause and then possibly a solution to the zombie pandemic that is sweeping the globe. They fly off to South Korea first, where the scientist moronically ends up slipping and shooting himself in a panic, leaving superman, uh, I mean Gerry, to come up with a solution all on his own. He's then off to Jerusalem for a spell to a walled-in compound that's eventually invaded by zombies and from there it's a plane trip back to Europe that ends up crashing due to an outbreak on board. Conveniently it dumps him and his new Israeli one- armed commando female friend (Daniella Kertesz) within walking distance of the W.H.O., where Gerry must risk all to prove a theory he's come up with by observing the zombie behavior on his trip.Fans of the novel this is supposedly based upon are likely going to be furious that this has next to nothing to do with the book. It's almost like they just wanted to use the snappy title and didn't really concern themselves with the story author Max Brooks had come up with at all. I know this had numerous production problems along the way, so maybe that played a part in the underwhelming finished product. Brooks' vision had the Romero-style slow-moving zombies that eat humans. Because this film just had to be PG-13, it changed the zombies from flesh-eaters to fast- moving 'infected' zombies who bite victims simply to spread the virus before moving on to someone else. Either way, they are not the least bit scary. In fact, often times they're unintentionally hilarious doing these exaggerated twitches, chomping their teeth, running around at about 60 MPH, leaping all over the place like overly-excited cats and creating these hilarious zombie stacks to ascend tall walls and buildings. The makeups are fine but forgettable and the CGI is fairly well-executed, but not well-executed enough to where much of this doesn't look cartoonish.Though some of the action scenes are fairly exciting and well-done in a generic big budget kind of way, the only new mythos this adds to the mix are making these 'living dead' selective about who they kill and infect. Somehow the infected have developed an amazing new way to tell whether someone has a terminal illness or not simply by looking at them (!?) They then refuse to attack or bite that person because, essentially, it would be a waste of their time. Though there's an attempt to explain why this is, it's all rather silly and the concept doesn't work at all.Because Pitt was the star and producer and wanted this to be his star vehicle, the supporting cast is comprised almost entirely of unknown actors. The few familiar faces (like David Morse) are there and gone in a matter of minutes as SuperBrad - complete with a ridiculous- looking Jesus / messiah haircut - saves the world.",5,4,6,27 August 2014
The Terminator," Iconic, suspenseful action / sci-fi / horror film.
","'The machines rose from the ashes of the nuclear fire. Their war to exterminate mankind had raged for decades, but the final battle would not be fought in the future. It would be fought here, in our present. Tonight...' Earth's future is a grim one where the landscape is a wasteland and our own technology has backfired and created super-intelligent cyborgs and machines capable of thinking on their own and who've all but taken over the planet. In fact, by 2027 the world looks like one huge junkyard where aircraft fire purple and blue lasers into the night sky and large tanks roll around crushing scrap metal and skulls. The last surviving humans on the planet are in the midst of a losing war, but find a savior in John Connor, who will eventually save mankind. Unfortunately, the machinery have also managed to master the form of time travel and thus have another trick up their sleeve to prevent John from even coming into this world.A naked, muscular man (Arnold Schwarzenegger, in his star-making role) suddenly appears out of nowhere in a flash of lightning somewhere in Los Angeles, present day. First things first, he needs some clothes and gets them from a trio of punks after sending his fist all the way through one of them. Then it's off to pawn shop to load up on shotguns, Uzis and ammo. No need to pay: just shoot the clerk. From there, a quick glance at the phone book reveals there are three Sarah Connor's living in the city and, since this man isn't actually a man at all but an emotionless humanoid cyborg sent there with one goal in mind, he gets to work hunting each of the ladies down and exterminating them, for one is the future mother of John Connor. Appearing somewhere else in L.A. is Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn); a flesh-and-blood human this time, and a good guy, who's there to try to prevent the Terminator from accomplishing his goal.After quickly dispatching the first two Sarah's and numerous other people who get in the way, the terminator finally manages to track down the third - and correct - Sarah (Linda Hamilton) in a club at about the same time as Kyle. Kyle manages to get her out of there in one piece (can't say the same for many of the other patrons) and from then on out it's an action-packed, fast-paced pursuit through the city with car chases, shootouts and explosions aplenty as our heroes try to think of a way to kill an unstoppable killing machine that seems impervious to most kinds of conventional weaponry. One of the best sequences is when the terminator shoots up dozens of cops at a police station, which also happens to contain the famous line 'I'll be back.' Seeing this movie first as a kid in the late 80s and now again as an adult, I can say it's held up well over the years thanks to strong storytelling and despite any advances in fx technology.Made on a budget of just 6.4 million dollars, the film became one of the year's surprise hits; grossing 38 million in the U.S. alone (nearly 80 million worldwide). Though that doesn't seem like a whole lot nowadays, the film's reputation grew throughout the decade and by the time Cameron returned with T2 in 1991, the budget had skyrocketed to 100+ million and the film grossed double that, making it the #1 box office draw of its year. TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES (2003) boasted a price tag somewhere between 170 and 200 million dollars and did better overseas than in the U.S. Ditto for the Schwarzenegger-free, 200-million-budgeted TERMINATOR SALVATION (2009). There was also the TV series 'Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles,' which lasted two seasons, and an upcoming fifth film in the franchise is coming in 2015.Because the screenplay shared numerous ideas from several Harlan Ellison stories, the author ended up suing. It was settled out of court and Ellison received a special thanks acknowledgment in the end credits.",8,0,1,26 August 2014
American Psycho," Toned down from the novel, but the satire is still intact.
","Bret Easton Ellis' novel was thought to be unfilmable, but it's great someone tried, and pulled no punches about it. Sure, some of the more sick and tasteless scenes were omitted, but the tone and biting satire of the piece remains, and that is what's important.Christian Bale stars as Patrick Bateman, a 1980s Wall Street tycoon in NYC who has it all...and he KNOWS it--good looks, a nice body, loads of money, a penthouse apartment and a rich bitch fiancée (Reese Witherspoon). He's also a psycho suffering from the shallowness, prejudice and personal anonymity in his upscale lifestyle who can't control his homicidal tendencies.This film is initially an assault on yuppiedom and 1980s conservatism (with perfect music score by John Cale and appropriately sunny pop tunes), and although this doesn't necessarily have enough satiric stabs for a feature length movie, it's compulsively watchable nonetheless. In a world of platinum cards, Valentino suits, decadent nightclubs, A-list restaurants and exaggeratedly vapid characters, it's pretty outrageous seeing Bale (who's terrific) stab a bum ('Get a goddamn job!'), axe a coworker, aim a nail gun at the back of his meek secretaries head and, covered in blood, chasing a hooker down a hallway with a chainsaw. He also quotes Ed Gein, watches Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE (and porn tapes), and listens to Ronald Reagan lie on national TV about Iran Contra.Like Harron's I SHOT ANDY WARHOL, the movie, no matter how out-there it gets, is grounded by the extremely passionate, uncompromising beliefs of the protagonist. Harron co-scripted with Guinevere Turner (who also appears as a victim). On a side note, the amusing raincoat/murder scene may have actually been borrowed from the film Hollywood CHAINSAW HOOKERS!",7,1,2,7 May 2003
Moulin Rouge!," Gorgeous, colorful, stylish,...BRAINLESS!
","Let's face it, a huge chunk of money was sunk into MOULIN ROUGE! and when you're working with a big budget you can make visual miracles a reality. It's the same thing Lucas did with STAR WARS, EPISODE 1, another dazzling display of visual technique. That said, this film, like EPISODE 1, is completely empty and worthless beyond the asthetics, and it's bludgened to death by overlength and cornball dramatics. I just don't get the appeal of these things. I'd also like to note that escapist cinema is a good thing, but it does NOT have to insult our intelligence. I think I had a difficult time swallowing this because of the ineffectual, cliche-ridden and cheesy dialogue & plot developments, but apparently that didn't matter to many people since this landed smack in the middle of the Top 250 list and got nominated for so many awards.Ewan McGregor is becoming a sell-out (just look what big bucks did to once-good actors Jeff Goldblum and Nicolas Cage) and Nicole Kidman is asked to do very little than stand around a look ravishing (she's very good at that, but why couldn't Madonna have played this role?). Baz Luhrmann's intentions here are to get across that (I'm quoting him from the 2002 Oscar telecast) 'Love is the big picture!' I respond with a big fat 'No sh*t there, Baz!' OK, so the execution of the worn out plot is different, but if hyperkinetic camerawork, spastic characters bouncing off the walls and overkill special FX is the price I have to pay for originality, then I'll pass.Little rings true in this film. The emotions are forced and fake. The reinterpretations of classic songs are terrible, the singing voices are pretty mediocre...Catherine Martin and others did brilliant work with the art direction and costumes and she was rightfully applauded, so I will give the film that much. A far as this new age of musicals, Lars von Trier's DANCER IN THE DARK is leagues better than this attention-hogging 'musical for a new millenium.' Bjork delivered a haunting performance in DANCER that easily eclipses Kidman's work here (and I don't mean to state the obvious by adding she's a much better singer). Unfortunately for the Icelandic elfen princess, she's not as easy on the eyes as Kidman...and that seems to be what's most important to movie-goers and critics.I recommend DANCER over this any day, but I always applaud originality, even when it doesn't actually work as is the case with MOULIN ROUGE!, so...Score: 4 out of 10.",Null,0,1,19 June 2002
Mulholland Drive," Typical enigmatic puzzle from Lynch.
","You could probably have a direct link into David Lynch's brain and still not figure out some of his films. That's really part of the fun and appeal--the gestation period that follows when viewers want to explore the options and meanings of what they've just seen. It works for me. I'm a big fan. One thing that stood out to me is the strong anti-Hollywood subtext. Take for instance when Betty (Naomi Watts) first arrives in L.A. as a fresh-faced, bright young thing. She's full of naivity and hope even when the troubled amnesiac 'Rita' (Laura Harring) shows up at her pad with a scar on her head and a dark secret. The women set out to explore the mystery, develop a trusting bond and become lovers. It may all be a dream. This all changes when the women flip-flop characters and then we get a look at what life in shallow Hollywood can do to a person. Harring's 'Rita' becomes Camilla, a devious bisexual actress who's taunts her lover Diane (Watts again) by flaunting her infidelities in front of her. The studio setting is painted as creepy and mysterious, yet oddly alluring. The film is full of biting commentary on the Hollywood system which I felt to be the core issue, but what do I know? Only Lynch can know for sure. The strong use of light blue and red all over the place instantly allude to good and evil simultaneously at work within the city. A scary witch-like vagrant pops up from time to time and may be the devil or may just be those cruel, life-crushing, superficial forces at work inside the Hollywood system that have claimed many victims over the years. There's a lot going on in the film, which is great. Movies that make you really think are rare nowadays. I'd also like to say that Naomi Watts is stunning in the dual role that requires her to run the gamut of emotions. Try not to melt during her breathy audition scene and try not to feel the sting of jealousy when she's betrayed by her lover. Wow! Laura Harring and Justin Theroux are also great and I was thrilled to see James Karen in a scene. The music by Angelo Badalamenti is haunting and gorgeous, as is the Del Rio song in Silencio. The photography and editing are also excellent. Don't miss it if you like Lynch or are sick of the brainless crap that dominates Hollywood cinema. Score: 9 out of 10.",10,3,5,11 July 2002
A Beautiful Mind," Good for Hollywood, but no classic.
","Again, I won't recycle the plot of this movie since it's well covered below, just to say that this is a good, although nearly fictional Hollywood biopic. Ron Howard is trying to put a human face on mental illness and prove even the most ostracized, alienated of people still yearn for the basic feelings of love, acceptance and relevance in this world. Akiva Goldsman's script is serviceable, though there are several phony moments, character actions and speeches that don't hit home. In other words, it has that 'Only-in-Hollywood' mentality that stretches credibility to the limit.The most deserving of it's four Oscars was the one that went to Jennifer Connelly, while nearly everyone who stepped up to the podium praised Russell Crowe and said they wouldn't be there without him. Crowe is of course, fine as always, but Ms. Connelly is every bit as responsible for the film's success and critical praise as Crowe. She's the genuine heart of this movie, generates a lot of emotion through simple facial expressions and obviously put a great deal of care and heart into this performance. It shines through and keeps this uneven film grounded most of the time.My score: 7 out of 10.",Null,0,2,27 March 2002
Signs," Wake up! Signs borrows HEAVILY from Night of the Living Dead.
","I just want to point out one thing here that people are too blind to see--It needs to be made perfectly clear that M. Night Shyamalan borrows heavily from low-budget horror classics that never got the attention they deserved in their day. THE SIXTH SENSE, Shyamalan's breakthrough hit, stole it's entire central conceit (lead character really dead for the entirety of film, unbeknownst to us viewers) from the low-budget Kansas-shot classic CARNIVAL OF SOULS, which had, in turn, borrowed the idea from an old TWILIGHT ZONE episode. Everyone praised SENSE'S 'originality' while CARNIVAL got shelved and badly distributed over the years. Now we get SIGNS, which is pushing into religious territory as filtered through Spielbergian fashion Americans love so much.Come on folks, you have seen this film before. Wake up and look at the SIGNS...Pennsylvania farm house, boarded up, being invaded by scary things in the dark while the terrified inhabitants look for answers by watching TV news broadcasts that come and go... That's the same plot as George Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD substituting aliens for zombies, isn't it? Even though Romero was interested in tapping into racism, sexism and human interaction, while Shyamalan is using the crop circles plot to focus on a different kind of interaction (man and God), it still angers me that a high-profile director can do a film like this and get endless applause when they borrow so many ideas from others who got pigeonholed, ignored and ridiculed.Even though I walked away from this film with a bizarre aftertaste, I'm going to be fair by saying it is subtle, focused, sensitive, well-acted and tense in parts. But it's also time to give George Romero credit for his massive impact on fantasy, sci-fi, horror and suspense films and it's time for people to go back to the original horror classics and understand where the so-called 'new and original' ideas present here, and in so many other big-budget blockbusters, stem from.Score: 5 out of 10.",5,1,2,5 August 2002
Identity," Watchable, but overall a disappointing waste of talent.
","Ten or so people become stranded at a vacant hotel on a dark and very rainy night. Emotions are high since a woman has been hit by a car and is seriously injured. The roads are blocked off by flooding. No one can escape. What better time for a psycho killer to start picking them off one by one?That's the basic plot of this TEN LITTLE INDIANS-style suspenser, with all of the expected plot twists and brief gory flashes of violence, and it actually begins surprisingly well. The production values/technical credits are top-notch and the cast is good. John Cusack as a chauffeur escorting obnoxious actress Rebecca De Mornay, Ray Liotta as a cop with insane killer Jake Busey in his custody, Amanda Peet as a reformed hooker with a stash of dough, Clea Duvall and William Lee Scott as a bickering young couple, John C. McGinely as the husband of the wounded woman and (especially) John Hawkes as the sleazy hotel manager round out the cast of suspects. Several interesting things happen along the way in this film before it completely derails in the final third.Despite strong things working in its favor, IDENTITY has several dull stretches and the ending is very poor, a frustrating cop-out to those of us who have seen this same tired ending a million times before. Whatever psychological mishmash the filmmakers want to throw at us is irrelevant; the ending here is no different than the 'it was all a dream' ploy used to bail out after the script becomes an overplotted mess there's no other way out of.",5,18,32,20 May 2003
