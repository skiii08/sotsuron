Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Action packed and a good laugh
","What can i say? Johnny Depp is awesome in this movie as Captain Jack Sparrow, Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa, Penélope Cruz as Angelica Malon, Richard Griffiths as King George (If you don't know who he is he is the actor that played Uncle Vernon in Harry Potter) that's not all there are a lot more good actors in this movie. The story/plot (which i am not going to reveal) is simple and understandable and really well done. Unlike the other movies, POTC has new characters but as i said before you will have to watch and find out. Enough about that POTC is packed full of action, thrills, laughs and all. Please i highly recommend you watch it. 6/10. DID you know? Penélope Cruz was pregnant will acting in POTC and her sister played a role in the long shots. Kind regards, ben-james300. Good viewing.",6,0,2,3 July 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Best Movie Ever 10/10
","One of the greatest movies ever made. I have seen this movie lots of times and i recommend everybody watches it (even Star Wars Fans). Every single actor played a vital role in bringing to life Lord Of The Rings Elijah Wood (Frodo), Sean Astin (Samwise 'Sam' Gamgee),Sean Bean(Boromir), Orlando Bloom (Legolas Greenleaf), Billy Boyd (Peregrin 'Pippin' Took), etc (i could list more of the good actors but i fear it may take to long to list). But its not just the actors that brought it to life, Peter Jackson directed the movie. There are many departments that participated for example: WETA workshop made all the weapons, armor, make up, props, etc, and Howard Shore composed the theme songs. Please watch it i am sure you will enjoy it just as much as i have, but don't forget to read the book first or last. It is really worth your while. The plot is easy to understand and really suspenseful and interesting. I almost forgot if you are going to vist NZ (New Zealand) on your next vacation or if you live in NZ remember to check out WETA workshop in Wellington and Hobbiton in Matamata. Kind regards, ben-james300",10,0,1,3 July 2011
Patton," Long and boring but a worth while movie to see.
","Too long and not as action packed as some long movies i have seen (Lord of the rings). I liked the fact that this war movie was from the point of view of a General. Music was not well done and had a annoying ring that gets stuck in your head long after the movie. But on the other hand i liked the full version of the main theme during the intermission. The main theme had a bold feeling to it, and makes you feel strong. Sound affects were not that well constructed during the days that it was released. The best bit about it was the story, about General Patton a US field commander (I am not sure of all the ranks and roles of the US army but i am sure the facts i presented a true) My comments may not seem all that well so judge it for yourself and see what you think. Kind regards, ben-james300.",1,4,27,13 July 2011
Inception," Good for some
","I have seen many great movies and i have seen this movie, but it was not up to my standards. The plot was a little confusing (when i say a little, i mean a lot) but on the lighter side the fight scenes were good so were the actors that participated like Leonardo DiCaprio (really awesome actor he was in Blood Diamond, and of course Titanic)there was also Pete Postlethwaite (who died recently, you would of seen him in Jurassic Park and The Usual Suspects)that is not all Michael Caine got a role in this movie and i am sure everyone knows of his work. 3/10. (-7/10 because of the plot) I recommend you still watch it no matter what i said, or what other people said because everybody has there own opinions. Kind regards, ben-james300",1,5,11,3 July 2011
