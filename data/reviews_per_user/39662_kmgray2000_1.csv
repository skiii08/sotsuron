Who Framed Roger Rabbit," This is a ground-breaking masterpiece that will never be replicated
","Who Framed Roger Rabbit is an artful picture that enters new territory by interspersing 2D animation with live actors. Seeing the behind-the-scenes and how puppetry was combined with animatronics in order to create practical effects is a mind-boggling experience. The acting here is top-notch, magnificent. It takes real skill to interact with nothing for almost two hours worth of footage. The blending of carton and reality provides an experience like no other. I sincerely believe that no one today would be able to recreate this movie or even this style with as much authenticity as seen in this picture.I am not easily bothered by movies, but the final scene disturbed me and caught me off guard in the best way, just as intended. Most of the effects were flawless, especially considering when this was made and released, but there were a couple moments when the effects were lacking a certain refinement to the point of distraction, which is why I cannot give it a full ten stars, but still, I consider this a fantastic picture.",9,3,3,21 November 2019
