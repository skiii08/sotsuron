Scarface," Best film ever!
","Scarface ,for me is more than a movie! Any film that can be watched 250 odd times and still enthrall has to go down as one of the best. Intense, operatic, melodramatic, overblown and frankly insane! More than any other film, it builds momentum from sceane to sceane, chugging forward from a slow start to climaxe with perhaps the most memorable ending in cinama history. Pacino is my faverout actor, by far, and its a testament to his performance that when I watch it I forget Im watching Pacino - as the tagline goes...'Al Pacino IS Tony Montana'. He becomes Tony. He nails the role in a way no-one else possibley could have.No film has ever had so many memorable quotes - every scene is taut, with such vehement tension - the acting, the script, the music, direction; everything has 11/10 writen all over it.You'll either love it hate it. Nah'm sayin'?",10,1,2,12 September 2002
Taxi Driver," A lonely mans slide.
","First I should say that I really am not a Scorsese fan. I think he over directed to the detriment of stories and his films never feel realistic to me. But this is very different.To set a film in one of the worlds most bustling metropolis's and create the repressive feeling of lonliness and vacuity present in this film is an achievment. I have to say, the more I watch this film the more I appreciate it, the monologues and diary entries are ingenius.I have to give this 9.5/10. I cant think of any other film that got into a characters head so much whilst giving out so many tid-bits of dialogue and info.Dark and very believable, in an unconventional way.",10,0,0,26 September 2002
Back to the Future Part III," 2nd best, minor spoilers
","Nothing beats the original but this film has two of the three most hilarious moments in the trilogy and for that I like it more than the 2nd which I found ill-fittingly dark, for some reason.The first moment of inconceivable mirth features Doc Brown furlong and disconsolate nursing a single shot post sunrise surrounded by slack jawed half-wits.Finally downing the whisky he stiffens like a enthused cock, falling, already unconscious on to the dusty floor knocking over a table in his declension. TIMBER!The second finds the exultant Mad Dog Tannen, after shooting Marty, swaggering forward, redistributing weight from one foot to another in a gleeful fashion as he takes a bow and slurs the words 'thank you, thank you' in a hilariously illusory show of appreciation for the gaping crowd.Coulda been even better if not for minor plot holes which only the ridiculously obsessive fan would pick up on and an overly neat and upbeat ending which comes of aspatronising to the viewer.....a more contemplative ending would have been a far more fitting end to the story. Doc shoulda stayed in the Old West.8.5/10 - recommended!",9,2,3,19 December 2003
Once Upon a Time in America," 4hrs!?
","Firstly it should be clear that Im not knocking this film as such. Its well acted, is visualy stunning, and has the same slow moving, classy feel as the Godfather...probably even more classy feeling. BUT...I never caught on to anything in the story that could constantly justify this being so long. It feelis like a 2hr movie painfully streched to 4hrs. Its trying to be grandious and epic, but after a few hours just becomes boring. I would give this 7, as the sheer beauty of lookig at it makes it worth watching, but essentially its just too slow.In fact strike that and make it a 6 - the extra point being deducted for that abhorent, p***-poor make up job in attempting to make Elizabeth McGovern look old. It was just pittifull.",8,0,3,16 February 2003
Pulp Fiction," Overrated nonsense.
","OK, there are good scenes in this film...mainly the ones Willis or Keitel in them, but overall the following gripes I have with this film make me unable to enjoy it.1) Why does it not just run chronologically? Its clearly just a pointless gimmick that adds nothing to our enjoyment or understanding of the story.2) Pulp Fiction is just a vehicle, like most his other films, for Tarantino to write out his geeky fantasies. And why does he cast himself in his films he's a hideous actor.3) The dialogue. Does everyone always have to be so super cool? Its completely unnatural. The whole style of the film actually irritates me greatly in some sub-conscience was that I cant quite articulate.I write this as I was on Keitels IMDB page and viewed his films as rated by members and almost keeled over in disbelife to see that this geek-fest is rated above Taxi Driver...really, I just dont know anymore. lol. :)",3,3,13,14 July 2003
The Godfather: Part III," Unjustly maligned...
","Having rewatched this film last night I thought I would post my feelings on it after revaluation.I would now rate it as being a better film than its 7.2 rating reflects, but I can see why people are so hard on it because all of this films problems were completely self inflicted.Firstly, skimping on the 2m dollars extra it would have cost to cast Robert Duval as Hagen is just an unforgivable blunder and a horrible example of greed over art. Duval's character would have given the movie a depth and a link to the first two that was sorely missing. Connie and Kay had the emotional family aspectcovered but every scene that involved business was almost sucked into the void left by Hagen.  Secondly the casting. Gee-whiz. I think enough has been said about Sofia's casting as Mary - its essentiallypointless to elaborate other than to say it was horrible. Also the actor playing Vicent just didn't do it for me. He displayed no depth whatsoever...that may have been deliberate but if so it was a mistake.BUT...on the positive side, I thought the writing was again excellent, the story was intricate and bloody in keeping with the Godfather tradition and thedirecting was again visually plush and rich and always moved at the right pace.And then there's Pacino. *moment of speechless awe* One of his last great performances before the 'Scent of a Women' Oscar ruined his career. Lastly, the ending was the best ending of any of the The Godfather films. When Kay and Connie look over at Michael as he screams in anguish they both havean expression of  shocked understanding as if all his actions are finallyexplained - as if after all of the years they are truly seeing him for the very first time. Its a beautiful ending.I'd give it, in IMDB ratings 8.0/10.",8,0,1,5 August 2003
The Deer Hunter," A record for the fewest words of Dialogue per minute?
",There are so only so many scenes of quiet reflective poignancy you can put in one film before the silence bores you to tears.This isn't to my taste. Dull stuff.6/10 (The six being for the excellent acting),6,0,0,20 August 2003
Gangs of New York," Too much
","First 3/5ths of this movie were good, the second seemed to be trying to jam a month long history course into an hour whilst also keeping the, by this time almost forgotten story moving. Scorsese oviously has a massive interest in this period in history and wanted to give a nod to every major occurance of the era, but he forgot that this was meant to be a linear story about characters not a documentary. Mah...Furthermore, its either a sing of the derth of acting talent coming thru or the abject lazziness of the people casting this that for a street gangster we were stuck with Leonardo DiCaprio. Im sorry he emminates as much menace and street wise toughness as Donald Duck. Good enough actor but the leader of a murderous street gang? On the plus side Bill the Butcher was a fantastic character and the action sceanes were V.Good. 3 star.",Null,0,0,3 July 2003
