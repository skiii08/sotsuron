Scarface," This is the best gangster movie ever filmed.
","'Scarface' and 'Goodfellas', are the best gangster movies ever filmed. Let's see why 'Scarface' is an amazing movie.Tony Montana, who came to the United States thrown out by the Castro's regime with his friend Manny alongside in search for the American Dream, has ended up being involved in the drug business, instead of working legitimately. His personality is flawless, because he is very determined to reach his goal and to get what he wants. Still remaining one of the most influential bad guys of all time, Tony had reached the top of his dream, with his criminal empire at its peak and with a few people by his side. Sadly, however, you can't always stay at the top forever. Slowly, Tony starts making so many mistakes that it led to the end of his life.Pacino shows us the violent anger we didn't see in Michael Corleone. Where Michael would say 'Never hate your enemies, it clouds your judgment', Tony Montana would kill everybody. He proves to be the greatest actor ever (along with Robert De Niro). He manages to bring reality to his character by adopting a Puerto-Rican accent for the film-making purposes and leaves a strong impression. Pacino's Montana rips across the screen with the unstoppable force of a runaway train.So like i said, this is definitely my favorite mafia movie of all time, because it shows (although violently), that Tony Montana was a determined man who sets his eyes on his goals and goes through every obstacle that stands in his way.This gangster film is harsh, very violent, loud, gross and must hold the record for uttering the word 'f**k' the most number of times.This is a masterpiece and i strongly recommend it to you.«All I have in this world is my balls and my word and I don't break them for no one.» Tony Montana.",10,1,2,30 April 2005
