The New World," Mallik's Singular Vision
","This film didn't seem to be as much about history as rather his-story. In this case, it's all about Mallik's personal concept of what might have happened. While all of this is diverting, for me it didn't have the ring of factual authenticity.What it does have are very beautiful photographic images. It's been reported that some million feet of film was used to render the finished product. So there was much footage from which to select for the final cut, and this was done with the greatest of care.Unfortnately, I didn't get much involved on an emotional level. The characters seemed set down amidst attractive scenery and revolved around the periphery of a striking production, rather than driving the action forward.There were two very long musical sequences that employed an undulating upper brass atop a lower brass drone that seemed to last forever (brasses used in this manner get old very quickly). Then there was a Mozart piano concerto excerpt that struck me as rather incongruous to early settlers in a new land with military fortresses and Indian villages.In the end, technique seemed to rein over expression, which amounted to a most attractive production without much emotional substance.",5,0,1,3 December 2008
Citizen Kane," Secrecy's the Best Policy . . .
",". . . that is, if you want to enhance chances for creating a great artwork. Chaplin knew this, and he reportedly distracted bankers who came to his set to see for themselves what was going on. Chaplin and his child star Jackie Coogan did flatfoot and shimmy routines that delighted and diffused their uptight backers.So Welles dazzled his inquisitive studio and banking chiefs with displays of magical disappearing acts and levitations. All the while crating a masterpiece behind the closed doors of his set.It was to Welles' good and bad fortune that he convinced Nelson Rockefeller to add additional funding when the original 'Kane' money was running low. While the production was able to be completed, Welles found himself owing Rockefeller. This debt was reportedly paid in the form of being pulled away from the completion of 'The Magnificent Ambersons' to do 'It's All True' at Rockefeller's bequest. The consequence: studio editing of 'Ambersons' without Welles' approval.It's all about art vs. business, and fortunately 'Ambersons' turned out well, despite the studio cutting. The negative side was Welles' being placed on a list of hard-to-work-with personalities in the profession.There's been enough said about the value of 'Kane' among these user reviews, so may these remarks serve as a tiny footnote.",10,1,3,25 August 2012
"I Love You, Man"," Smart Comedy
","This adult script is cleverly written by John Hamburg (who also directs) and Larry Levin. They've come up with a pleasant little film that's very light weight, yet quite diverting.My only previous familiarity with Paul Rudd was 'The Object of My Affection,' and I was very impressed with his work. To me he's a kind of American Hugh Grant, completely natural and most engaging. Here he's called on to stretch himself a bit and become more animated. He rises to the challenge nicely.Jason Segel has a colorful, off-beat role, which he handles like a breeze. He creates a sort of clumsy character who still is no dummy. Segel and Rudd beautifully play off one another in this bouncy romp. The rest of the cast all do well, and viewers who are in a light, frothy mood, can enjoy this bit of fluff.",7,2,6,21 March 2009
Brokeback Mountain," Superb Classic
","Years after seeing this film, I am still haunted by its beauty and perfection. Ang Lee really outdid himself in fashioning a realization of a lovely short story.The cast is uniformly excellent, the photography brilliant, and the score most moving. It ranks as one of the greatest films ever made, and goes down cinematic annals as a masterpiece.Though it may be unfair to make a comparison to the film that won Best Picture that year, 'Brokeback' is a far superior work. I predict that years after the former will be forgotten, 'Brokeback' will be revived again and again and rediscovered by future generations.",10,21,24,8 January 2008
Life of Pi," Good film
","This film is so beautiful to see, and the director's production so enthralling, that it rather grieves me to criticize the work, but that I'm compelled to do.The problem with this is that the adult Pi's interpretation of his adventures both confuses and undermines the narrative. He (and writer) are so committed to making this interpretation as vague and general as possible that it leaves one in limbo.Likewise such things as the 'canivorous island' sequence dips into the fantasy idiom, which conflicts with its realistic content, making for muddled genre.Finally, in an effort to be inclusive regarding Pi's religious background, the writer chose to specify particular religions, thereby muddling the narrative's purity. It would have been better to dramatize the spirituality rather than specify it by naming names. This later limits the story's universality and further complicates the narrative's purpose.By keeping things as vague as possible, I'm sure many viewers think there's something deep here . . . something mystical and of a high plane. Actually I see it as a smoke screen for appearance sake and special effect.Still, the director's production is at such a high technical level that the film must be correctly be called 'good.'",7,4,8,24 November 2012
The Battle of Algiers," Gillo's Best
","'La Battaglia di Algeri' (1966) tells a very sad story. That it is true makes it all the more tragic. Yet out of this strife comes a remarkable film.It's easy to see how Pontecorvo made only a few other notable films, the most famous being 'Queimada!' (1967). His star in the latter, Marlon Brando, undoubtedly was persuaded to work on the basis of Gillo's film of the Algerian-French battle.On reading and viewing the history of the making of 'Battle of Algiers' I can understand how Pontecorvo put a lifetime of energy and commitment into this project. The film is unforgettable for its realistic, documentary look. There have been other films to obtain such an image, but 'Battle' is outstanding in the way so large a cast was employed. Indeed, it's hard to believe so many 'extras' could be recruited, much less give such convincing performances.Two critical quotes of the film are notable: the Washington Post hailed it as being 'just as important for our time as the work of Griffith, Riefenstahl, Dryer and Visconti were for theirs.' And the New Yorker exclaimed, 'Pontocorvo and his team show the capability of convincing the cinema public that revolution, in certain circumstances, is a necessary thing.' While the rebels are given a sympathetic perspective, the French are likewise fairly depicted--all resulting in a kind of observational, reportorial essay on a historical event. The entire viewing experience is quite unforgettable.",9,0,1,20 February 2009
Behind The Candelabra," Fine Film on Lee's Final Years
","It was initially disappointing to hear the difficulty encountered in trying to find a Hollywood studio to take on this project. When HBO finally signed on, thanks to Jerry Weintraub, and to be a made-for-TV movie, expectations for its success dropped a bit.However, as it turned out, this was just the right sponsorship for a candid dramatization of the final decade of a great entertainer's life and career. Steven Soderbergh's direction is sharp and honest. Michael Douglas outdoes himself as Liberace, creating a full blooded character, never a caricature. This is a difficult acting feat, since the subject was such an ostentatious showman.Matt Damon likewise does a fine job as Scorr Thorson, and Debbie Reynolds is virtually unrecognizable as Lee's mother. The production values are excellent, and the film emerges as a genuine success..The film rightly won the Critic Choice TV Award, TCA Award and numerous Emmys, all in keeping with the project's commendable quality production.",8,1,3,20 November 2013
The Graduate," Landmark Late 60s Film
","Dustin Hoffman as Benjamin appears in closeup in the opening shot of the first scene. He continues to be in every scene till the end. It reminded me of Audrey Hepburn's Princess in 'Roman Holiday' and Vivien Leigh as Scarlett in 'GWTW.' The device is, get the viewer involved in the main character and follow him/her through the drama.In this case, it certainly worked. Even though Ben isn't the nice, straight-laced lad we might have thought in the beginning, he's there occupying our attention from start to finish. During the course, he's seen doing some morally dubious things. At one point Mr. Robinson calls him 'filth, scum,' and 'a degenerate.' That's a pretty strong indictment for a hero, and in fact he becomes an instant anti-hero, once his character is given verbal definition.While the film can't quite make up its mind whether it's a drama, satire, social commentary or comedy, it gives the impression it knows what it's about. Ben's sulking matches the wistfulness of the Simon-Garfunkel songs, and the whole enterprise is kept alive by brilliant acting, directing, photography, and editing.Anne Bancroft made Mrs. Robinson her own; Hoffman became an instant star; Katherine Ross was in fine form as well. Mike Nichols' work was constantly inventive and striking.Viewed today after many years, the film remains engaging; still, to me it seems to rather lack a heart and soul. It's neither negative nor positive, just sort of neutral, not amounting to much in the total scheme of things, yet an engrossing diversion of times past. Though 'plastics' are still very much with us.",8,1,3,21 April 2009
The Fly," Engaging Sci-fi Film
","Had David Cronenberg's 1986 re-inventing of the 1958 film of same name remained a sci-fi piece, it would have been better. For two thirds of this film it was on a pretty high level of character development and situation unfolding.I appreciated getting to know these characters, particularly those effectively played by Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis. Their rapport was strong and convincing, as was the general story line.However, as the script got more gross and it entered its third act, the proceedings turned more into a standard horror-shock piece. I would have preferred it remained on a higher, more scientifically astute plane.Even so, the over all project was nicely scripted, designed and acted and thus can be considered an above average sci-fi effort.",7,0,1,13 February 2015
Mr. Holland's Opus," Too Over-Whelming
","The same problem that plagued 'Akeelah and the Bee' is present in 'Mr. Holland's Opus.' The various episodes that occurred through Holland's life are each played with the emotional intensity as appropriate for a climax.Thus, put together, the film is skewed by such a sequence of highly charged emotional 'peaks.' The result is that the drama's form is thrown off, and instead of a general rise to a climactic plateau, the entire conceit is full of too many peaks.By the time the last scene comes, there's no where to go but to pile on the emotion, straining what intensity there is left to the breaking point. If the scenario had been put together with less routinely occurring crises, it would have helped shape the drama more palatably. As it is, by the end I just wanted to say, 'Oh please, no more.'Richard Dryfuss puts his all into this effort, and his work is most commendable. It's the writer and director that let him down by not better shaping the film's broad structure. A pity, for this could have been a really significant piece of work set in the public schools.",5,1,4,14 November 2010
