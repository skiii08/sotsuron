Raiders of the Lost Ark," Best out of all the Indiana Jones movies.
","Sure, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was gory. Sure, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was funny. But Raiders of the Lost Ark is the best out of the three. It blends humor with goriness and, most of all, adventure to provide a heck of a movie.It's great fun, but it's so much more. George Lucas' script is great, and the story itself is simple, but satisfying (Jones is asked bythe United States government to obtain the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis do). Drop what you're doing right now and watch it!***********************(23) stars out of a possible ***********************(23).
