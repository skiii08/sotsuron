Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Worth the Watch But Not Amazing
","I have to say I was really looking forward to Pirates of the Caribbean 4, I really enjoyed Curse of the Black Pearl.Then Dead Man's Chest and At World's End were good, but there was room for improvement.POTC: On Stranger Tides was full of action. The beginning is quite good but I struggled to get to grips with where we were since the last film. I soon got into it and it was good to see familiar faces! Depp and Rush were amazing as always and there's some pretty good new faces too! However - I did feel there were too many action sequences, and there's so many different groups of people going after the Fountain of Youth it becomes very confusing. I also felt it was difficult to understand why each person/group of people were going after the fountain? It also lacked the humour of The Curse of the Black Pearl.On the positive side again - we learn a lot more about Jack's character. But I perhaps feel he wasn't involved enough...But I would advise watching it. I will definitely buy the DVD and am looking forward to POTC 5!",7,22,38,20 May 2011
