Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," You Laugh, Then Feel Dirty
","Some of the scenes within Borat definitely make the movie worth viewing, ... one in particular. However, one should discuss their opinions after the movie. You'll find interesting reactions. Much of the movie is about laughing at negative stereotypes, mixed in with some bathroom/shock humor. After waiting in line for an advanced screening, I was ready to laugh at anything. Some of my reaction might have been subconsciously forced. Nevertheless, the attack on religion was particularly telling. Yes, Cohen made fun of his Jewish heritage, but it was satire that presented Jews as the victims of ignorance - which, unfortunately is the case in much of the world. However, when he directs his camera towards Christians, he doesn't want us to laugh at their persecution, but rather he wants us to laugh at their religion itself. Furthermore, it is interesting that Islam was't mentioned once in a movie partially set in Kazakhstan. In all, there is enough creativity in how Cohen crafted some of the humor, that the movie will make you forget about things for a few hours, which is sometimes, the reason we go.",4,14,55,30 September 2006
