Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Utter crap. (sfx and music aside)
","I can't believe this film comes from the same director who gave us the original magnificent 'star wars' trilogy. The special effects are fantastic, but if Id wanted nice gfx i'd have bought an x-box. There is no characterization. No story. No heart! I mean what is all that nonsense about doing a blood count to measure the force? Where is the mystery, the spiritualism, of the first films! WE DONT WANT EVERYTHING EXPLAINED GEORGE...that was the joy of the mysticism present in the original trilogy. And that Mr.Skywalker and Jar Jar...'WIPE THEM OUT! ALL OF THEM!' On the same evening as i watched this dvd, I watched Star Trek III: The Search for Spock and realised how much of a great film this was compared to the phantom menace...and it's only average trek. 'Empire' is such a magnificent film compared to this tripe....George give us back our religion, and stop trying to explain the unexplainable...give us a story, strong characters, a soul, a film with heart! All in all 2/10 one for John Williams' score and the other for the magnificent effects. Everything else, utter crap.",Null,0,1,28 October 2001
