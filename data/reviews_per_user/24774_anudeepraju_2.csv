Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Guy Ritchie's Holmes ............. a medieval 007!!!!
","Europe in 18th century witnesses a series of bombings..........which Holmes gets down to track with Dr.Watson ....... and all the clues lead him to one man ........Professor Moriarty who is keen to witness the world at war so as to give his arms and ammunition manufacturing an impetus.......which Sherlock Holmes is trying to avert......Downey Jr does seem again to excel in displaying his instincts as an actor.......and so does Jude..........we also have the beautiful Noomi Rapace.......and Jared Harris showing the wickedness of Moriarity. In the area of technical competencies ,the movie does seem to meet expectations........amazing visuals........stunning cinematography..... ecstatic sound design.......brilliant costume design and overwhelming art direction......and breath taking action sequences like setting a train on fire.........jumping off from heights..........and you know..... Hey but wait.....are we talking of a Jason Bourne giving an ultimatum or giving a total account of Ethan Hunt's action adventure as in MI...........Guy Ritchie projects Holmes as a medieval 007...Holmes was an intellectual man....not a thrilling action star!!!!!!!! And I never knew of Holmes trying to avert the possibility of a world war.......OMG!!!! did he really pose a threat to the arms and ammunition race.......come on guys ......any work of fiction should have some relevance to reality........but that is surely missing here........the script lacks authenticity on all grounds.........and holds no adherence to anywhere close to actual event of facts...........this is surely disappointing to anyone who had turned into ardent lovers of Downey's Holmes........ But on a whole the movie seems to score in the area of performances and technical wizardry..........worth once a watch.",6,1,2,27 December 2011
The Artist," The Artist is a tribute to the golden era of silent movies.............
",The Artist takes you decades back to only make you realize why you love movies.The charismatic Jean Dujardin and the effervescent Berenice Bujo are surely the best elements of the movie.The chemistry between Jean and Bujo is another facet which surely adds on to the beauty of the movie. A very mesmerizing screenplay and direction by Michael Hazanavicius only keeps the viewers asking for more.The music and the cinematography has also been effectively brilliant.In short the movie is simple and has that element of humbleness that makes it so very fascinating.The Artist is surely a tribute to that golden era of cinema where movies made in the heart of the filmmaker.,10,5,9,26 February 2012
