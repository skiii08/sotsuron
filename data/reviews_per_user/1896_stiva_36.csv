The Blair Witch Project," Not at all impressive...
","Now that I have finally seen this movie for I have heard great reviews about this movie, let me tell you what I think about this one.I have only two words to say about this movie, but I have to type a minimum of 10 lines to post my review. So, please bear with me about the boring words I going to saw. OK, you might say that this movie is old and me watching it now wouldn't be scary. Well, you are dead wrong. I saw the old Halloween (1& 2) movies recently and found them a little scary. I saw the The Exorcist the old movie and found it a little scary. It doesn't matter how old the scary movie is. It's all about how they present it to you. In that view I just have two words to say,'NOT... SCARY...'",4,1,2,29 September 2010
The Ring," Beware... You have no idea about this...
","Can I just say wow !!!I have watched a lot of horror movies. This is the only movie ever to scare me like hell. The story, awesome. The scary, awesome. The music, awesome. I watched this movie alone at night with lights off. It kept me completely off-the-edge. I felt the chill. I felt something crawling along my spinal cord. I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. The movie made me to jump a lot.I have seen this movie a lot of times. I remember each and every scene. Still, this movie scares the hell out of movie and makes jump a lot.For Story, I give it a 2... For music, I give it a 2... For acting, I give it a 2... For Scary, I give it a 3...Overall, I give it a 9/10...",9,1,2,11 July 2007
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A film nobody can forget...
","Steven Spielberg, you did it man. So far I had cried for three movie. Titanic, The Braveheart and now, E.T.This is not a movie of alien invasion nor human-alien battle. It's a movie about friendship, family and love. E.T. is a stranded alien. Elliot along with his brother, sister and friends takes care of the E.T. Elliot took it, no, took him home and hid him in his room. E.T. learned to talk. E.T. loved everybody. E.T. was also funny and cute. But, they had to send him back home as E.T. wanted to leave for home. When E.T. died, I couldn't breath. After he came back alive, I felt so happy. Finally, E.T. before leaving home, tells Elliot, 'Come'. It was really heartbreaking. I really cried. I didn't want E.T. to leave.Spielberg had really brought the emotions out of us. Kudos to you man. This movie is a complete magical delight. Watch this movie. Don't miss it. It will be impossible to find a person who doesn't like this movie. This is definitely going to my DVD collection.A 10/10 movie",10,0,1,10 January 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," *Alas*, my children! This is the day you shall always remember as the day that you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow - My favorite line...
","This is the best sequel I ever saw. This movie goes much further into the world of special effects. The creators of this movie had done an excellent job. Hats off to them.The story and the plot is good too. Jack Sparrow, awesome and funny as usual. He's definitely one hell off a pirate. In this movie, he creates a lot of confusions and commotions that leads more comedy.Then comes Davy Jones. On hearing his side of story I pity for him. I also felt kinda sad for him. The way Davy Jones played the organ with his tentacles and claws was awesome. I really liked that Davy Jones Theme.Buy this DVD. Watch it. Enjoy it. You won't regret it. This movie has it's moments. The action part of this movie was awesome and awe-inspiring.Aye-aye, mate !!!",8,1,3,21 September 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," That's got to be the best pirate I've ever seen. So it would seem. - A line from the movie...
","My all-time favorites. One of the best. I loved this movie. I enjoyed this movie. Very funny. Very entertaining. Awesome movie. Johnny as Jac Sparrow, Oh! my, can I just say wow. He was incredible. All the characters did very well. The story was awesome. The dialogs suited very well. The introduction of Jack Sparrow was awesome. The life of pirates was shown and explained very well. I won't go further into the story as it would spoil everything. A movie worth watching. A fun-thrilled adventure. Awesome special effects. Awesome music score. Watch this movie. You'll enjoy it. Buy this DVD. It's worth the money. It's worth the time.",10,0,3,21 September 2007
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," A Magical Journey Through Narnia...
","A wonderful movie. The characters are beautifully made from a well chosen characters. The CGI and special effects are top notch. The centaurs, beavers, trees, tigers, bears, fox, all are taking. Oh! yeah, they are talking. The creators have done an excellent job in bringing out the emotions, the lip sync, and the body language of various animal, very well. The White Witch was scary as hell. The final battle sequence was spectacular. I was amazed with the battle sequence.Aslan's character was the best. I love the way the Lion talks, walks and emotes. It's simply amazing. Amazing direction. Amazing music. Excellent make-up. Amazing editing work. A very good adoption of the Narnia series. Very funny movie too. Worth watching.",8,3,3,31 December 2008
Finding Nemo," The Underwater World.
","A breath-taking movie. Pixar had created a wonderful world through animation. A real treat for our eyes. Great story. Great comedy. Great action. Great adventure. Great world. Great characters. Great ride. My favorite, the fish Dora.It's about a father fish trying to get back his son fish who had been kidnapped by humans to Sydney. He travels all over the ocean to get his son back no matter what it cost him. An amazing movie about a father's love for his son.All praise goes to the creators. They have done an amazing job. Capital 'A'mazing. The animation water-world and fishes looks so realistic in nature. One of major plus point for Pixar Studios. They are real artist. Their hard work had really paid off.It's no surprise for this movie to be awarded the Best animated movie of the year.",10,1,2,25 July 2008
The Others," Let me catch my breath...
","phew !!! OK, my breath is back to normal, i guess. This is the second movie next to 'The Ring' to scare the hell out of me. The plot and the script are awesome. The cast is good too. Nicole Kidman did fairly well. Alakina Mann (Anne Stewart) did a wonderful job. Without any special effects, the director has given an excellent movie with creepy scary scenes. Usually, I don't get scared much. So far only 3 movies had scared the hell out of me and among then comes this one. The ending was shocking and it was a really good twist. I watched this movie alone at night around 12 with lights off. I almost screamed and jumped at certain places. I felt the shock and thrill rising in my chest to the top with much rapidity. It kept me completely glued to the movie.Horror fans, if you haven't watched this movie, rent this one and watch it. You won't regret it. It's a movie worth watching. I don't want to reveal anything here. Just watch it. Get scared.And, if you get easily scared don't watch it alone at night and particularly with lights off. But, that's where the fun lies, if you dare. Beware...",8,3,6,17 July 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Nobody move! Dropped me brain. - A line from the movie...
","A perfect end to one of the best trilogies I ever saw.This movie is way beyond anybody's imagination. Excellent plot. Awesome dialogs. Awesome special effects. Awesome music score. A perfect ending. The final fight in the ocean was awe-inspiring.Jack Sparrow as usual was at his best. Excellent performance. Nevertheless, everyone did very well. Jack Sparrow was funny and crazy as usual. His entry in the desert with his ship was awesome again. Even funnier, he fights his inner demons.Here, all the pirates from around the world unite to fight for their freedom. There are lot of awesome scenes. My favorite is the one where Jack Sparrow catapults himself from the enemy ship back into his ship.An awesome movie. Watch it. Buy the DVD. You won't regret it. It's a wonderful fun-filled action packed adventurous movie.Sit back and enjoy it...",9,2,2,21 September 2007
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Mischief Managed!
","I gotta say, this movie is good, but not that good. I liked 1 & 2 both movies as well as books. But, here I prefer the book. There seems to be some plot holes. Like when Peter was discovered, they didn't go much deeper like Rowling did in the book. They made some modifications, but I didn't mind them that much. I feel bad Richard Harris died as he was perfect for the role of Dumbledore. Special effects are good. The whooping Willow's location in this movie is different that of the second movie, I guess. There is no final talk between Dumbledore and Harry where Dumbledore explains about Peter Pettigrew's bond and more into the love of Harry's parent's.I give this movie 6.5 for 10.My order of movie rating in HP Series:- 1. Sorcerer's Stone - 8/10 2. Chamber Of Secrets - 7.8/10 3. Prisoner Of Azkaban - 6.5/10",6,0,0,11 January 2008
Ratatouille," A delicious movie...
","Pixar's best yet. The movie is well directed. The animation part of the movie was very well done. The lighting, the effects, the animations are awesome. Each and every tiny detail had been given importance. The way the rat moves, the fur, the rat getting wet, the texture, the color, the food, the emotions, the expressions, everything tops. The story is about a rat aspiring to become a chef.They have shaped the movie very well. The humor is at the perfect time. The twists are at perfect times. The food looks delicious to the eyes. This movie definitely deserves an Oscar.I am waiting eagerly for the next pixar movie Wall-E.Watch this movie if you haven't seen it. It's worth it.",10,1,3,11 January 2008
District 9," Bloody Brilliant. I have never seen anything spectacular as this since Ridley Scott's Aliens and Steven Spielberg's E.T.
","This is the best Science fiction film I have ever seen in my entire life so far.Basically, the movie starts with the introduction. the spaceship crashed on earth, hovering above the city of Johannesburg. It seems like they have lost a key to the main control. So they settle outside the city. The government provides protection. The District was officially named as 'District 9'. But, the people are scared and they want the aliens to leave the planet. So, the government find a new place far away from the people and the city where the stranded aliens can settle themselves. What happens after this is the entire story and how it goes from here.I assume that you came to watch this movie expecting it to contain lots of visual effects, high end graphics and hard-core Action sequences. If so, then you are in for a shock and a real treat. It is very unique in it's own way. Very less CGI effects are used. Less budget involved here. Not that much action sequences. We see how the aliens are treated and the consequences of our actions and mistakes. We see some similarities between us and them. We learn a lot of things from them. We get to see some high technology devices and weapons but not a lot and definitely not at all times, but only when necessary.The movie is gripping, terrifying, suspenseful, realistic and brilliant. The director has given us something that no other director has done in a very long time. New cast members and they have done an excellent job. Aliens look simple, yet terrifying. The storyline was crafted and written very well. Awesome camera work. This movie will serve as an icon for future movies in the film industry. This movie is a masterpiece. It'll become a legend. It'll be talked about for years.I hope more good movies will come in the future by learning from this. Kudos to the entire team for giving an amazing movie.A movie not to be missed.",10,1,4,14 October 2009
Batman Begins," The best Batman ever created.... A classic...
","Off all the superheroes created, Batman is my favorite. Reason, Batman is human. Just like us. But courageous and brave. He uses technology to fight evil.This is by far the best batman movie ever created. We see how Bruce Wayne became a Batman. We see how he got the costume, the bat mobile and all those technological stuffs to fight evil.Christain Bale fits the role of Batman perfectly. His voice, body language, appearance, everything fits. He studied the art of ninja through Liam Neelson, but, also learned that justice is different from revenge.Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes gives an amazing performance as well. Michael Cain as Alfred fits as a nice fatherly character for Bruce Wayne. Gary Oldman as Jim Gordan was awesome as usual as a honest cop fighting against evil along with Batman. Liam Neelsom as a violent vigilante who doesn't respect the value of the life of the innocents did well, nevertheless.In short, it's one hell of a movie, and, one hell of an adventure.",10,3,4,29 July 2008
2012," It's supposed to be a disaster movie... Well, guess what.... The movie is a disaster...
","------------------------------------------CONTAINS HEAVY SPOILERS------------------------------------------First let me tell the good parts as there is not much of it. Awesome special effects. Roland Emmerich has surpassed well in using special effects... And, that's the only good part about this movie.The script, whoever wrote it is a complete idiot. What's with all the drama? After this movie is over this is what came to my mind about the film.Opening:-1) Sun exploded. 2) 10-15 mins of Joan Cushack with his kids. 3) Then OMG... Earthquake, everybody get in the car. 4) Car almost crashed, we're dead. No, phew! close call. 5) Am flying the plane right into the disaster and destruction. 6) OMG! plane almost crashed. We're dead. No, phew! close call. 7) OMG! Mountain exploded. Fiery ball chunk from the mountain hit the truck I'm driving. My road is sliding upwards. I'm dead. No, phew! close call. 8) OMG! I am in the truck and along with the truck I fell into the abyss. 9) Hey, I am alive and I am seeing daylight. Wait a minute. How did I get off the truck and how did I survive? 10) Plane did not take off right. And, look thick black smoke encircled us along with the plane. We're dead. No, phew! close call.11) I am in a bigger plane now. I am very close to a crashing plane. I can't lift it up. My plane is almost 85 degrees vertical. We escaped it. Phew! But no, look behind the crashing building. Another crashing building. We knocked the Eiffel Tower. And We're dead. No, phew! close call. 12) Let's go to Hawaii. But, hey where is it? And where is there lava pond in the middle of Pacific Ocean. 13) OMG! We are in total chaos and disaster. Car won't start-up. The guy sitting next to the passenger seat then says, 'Car Start'. And car starts (What the hell was that? Was that suppose to be a joke? Am I suppose to laugh at this?). 14) Look, I stopped the plane without crashing it. Phew! close call. But, hey no. Me and the plane fell into the abyss. I am dead. 15) Hey, lookie here. Three gigantic metal shark ships. 16) Hello, there Mt.Everest. Sorry to bump into you. Didn't see you there. Let me just pull back and get on my way. See ya. 17) Africa wasn't destroyed. Yay! me, all the continents are gone except for Africa. That's why it's called Cape Of Good. Let's go there.The End.",1,75,110,20 February 2010
The Incredibles," Incredible...
","Even superheroes have a life to lead.Give them a break guys. Cut them some slack. Awesome simple plot. Awesome characters. A non-stop action filled adventure-comedy movie. What's more, it's a Pixar movie. Has all the elements of a typical Pixar movie. Mind-blowing animation, texture and special effects.I have to tell this guys. I have no idea how Pixar comes up these kinda awesome stuffs. Nothing can top Pixar animation-wise and effects-wise. From Toy Story and with each movie they evoloved so much and are still evolving much higher in animation stuffs. All Pixar movies are going to my DVD collection.They are the best.",10,1,1,31 July 2008
Kick-Ass," Kick-Ass just kicks ass...
","Can I simply just say wow!. Now this is what I call a real superhero comedy movie. The story is simple to its core. It's about a geek who fantasies on becoming a superhero.The character, Dave, a fan of super-hero comic books one days wonders whether anyone would take a stance and fight against crime. And, thus comes Kick-Ass into the picture. The complexity of the character written for Dave is performed excellently by Aaron Johnson. Who doesn't dream of becoming a super-hero in reality. Dream of being special and do something incredible. The character Dave here is a superhero not because he has super powers, but because he brings the inspiration for turning into a superhero. He successfully shows his strength in fighting crime as a normal human.The next best thing is the comedy and the timing. A complete blast. This movie will just blow you away. It's not good. It's not great. It's totally awesome. Character Dave dressed up as Kick-Ass and leaves home to fight crime only to find him looking for a lost cat. And the music is the next best part. In the where they play 'For A Few Dollars More' I just had this feeling like wow. I mean, for that part the music seemed fitting as such the other musical pieces in different parts of the movie. Yes, they seemed to fit well with the movie. Next, Nicholas Cage as the Big Daddy has his share of the movie. His appearance in this movie will be recognized well. This super-hero, he wants to wipe out the entire the criminal organization which took away his loving wife, shows the anger for his need to wipe out the crime as a human. Wouldn't you want to revenge on the person if he/she took the love of your life ? Nicholas Cage succeeds in showing both the human side as well as the superhero side struggling with the pain. The performance in this movie is class A.Next thing, my personal favorite, the amazing awesome Chloe Moretz as the Hit Girl. She completely steals away the entire movie. Every scene she's in is a complete delight to watch. Especially the last 25 minutes of the movie where the action sequences are spell-binding. I have seen lot of bad reviews. I don't care about them as it is impossible to satisfy the entire population of the world. I enjoyed this movie for what it was. A very bold attempt and it served it's purpose excellently well. Extremely funny and little sad filled with some mind blowing adrenaline filled action sequences. In short, this movie just kicks ass...",10,8,17,4 August 2010
Transformers," Wicked, Wild and Awesome...
","This is so far one of the coolest and best action fun-filled movie I ever saw in my life. The humor comes at the right moment. The action sequences are awesome. Animation and special effects, can I just say wow. I was stunned by it. My mouth was basically hanging open. A very fast paced entertaining fun-filled action movie. The music also suites the movie well enough. It's time for Autobots to rule. Autobots, you rock !!!Watch this movie in 3D-iMax theater. You won't regret. I was satisfied for the money I spent for this movie. I had to get this DVD soon.I give this movie a 8.9 for 10Heard there's sequel on it's way. Can't wait to get my hands on it. Can't imagine how awesome that's going to be...",8,6,10,18 September 2007
Paranormal Activity," Well, I going to have nightmares for a month, that's for sure...
","I am 24 years old and I have seen a lot of scary movies in the hope of finding one that would scare me a little. I have to tell you that it takes a lot to scare me. People say 'the Exorcist' is scary. I saw it and I agree that it's good movie. It has it's moments here and there. But not scary enough to shake me out. Then I heard that 'Others' is scary too. I saw that movie and, well, it has an interesting ending which build up the suspense. But, definitely not scary. Then people said 'Drag Me To Hell' was scary. Unfortunately, it was funny and I laughed throughout the movie. Then people said 'The Descent' is good. I would agree that it somehow achieved in scaring me a little but, not too scary.Now, to this movie. I have been waiting to see this movie for sometime since it hit the theaters. I have never heard about this one in the past. I heard this movie came out 2 years ago. Last night I got the chance to see this movie. The movie started, everything was going on fine. After 20-30 minutes the movie really started to dig in. A damn f*****g scary movie. Very creepy and freaky. I'll never forget this movie in my life ever. I can literally hear my heart thumping for scene after scene. Half-way through it, part of my mind was going like this, 'okay man, enough of this movie. Just shut the damn movie off and get to bed. You are frightened enough already. You don't want to have nightmares in your life.' The other part of my mind was going like this, 'You are f****d up, man. You are frightened already. It's too late to get out of it. You are going to have nightmares anyway. No matter whenever you turn off the movie it's gonna make no difference. Just get it over it. Like all other scary movies it has a positive ending, like good vs. evil and good wind.'. But, the shocking ending shook me to the core. After the movie was over i didn't move a muscle for 3 whole minutes. That scary. With those five characters alone and at a very low budget this movie was made.I am impressed. frightened. Very much. I accept I am a chicken. From now onwards, for some days or even weeks I won't be able to stay in total darkness with my mind buzzing not knowing what's in front of me nor behind me. But I am impressed with the movie. The fact that not a lot of background music was used in the movie made it so natural. I felt like I was in that room. I could the tension. Add to that the simple cam-coder made this movie even more eerie and scarier.Just remember, if you are looking for a fun simple horror movie, don't see this. You'll be pissing in your pants. You will be scared. frightened and horrified. Make no mistake about. Those who think they are tough and can't be scared, you need to take look into this. I guarantee you that you'll become a chicken by the end of the movie. Anybody who says that this movie is not scary, don't listen to them. They are either lying or trying to scare the hell out of you.This movie is not for the weak of heart. Try watching this movie alone at night. Better watch it with someone to be safe. I read online that after viewing this movie, Steven Spielberg thought the DVD given to him was haunted and brought it back to the studio in the garbage bag. Just think how scary it would have been.I hear they are going to make a sequel. If you ask me, no sequel is needed for this movie. It would drastically ruin it's reputation. I bet my life that if they go with it they add lots of special effects and background music which is so unoriginal. I don't need them to turn a brilliant movie into a joke by making a sequel.Just leave this movie alone. It's scary, creepy, freaky, horrifying and brilliant this way. We don't need a sequel nor a re-make for that matter nor a prequel.Just let it be.",10,0,2,31 October 2009
A Bug's Life," A classic Pixar...
","A typical Pixar movie...Awesome animation. Awesome comedy. Awesome story. Awesome adventure. Awesome characters. Pixar does it again. One of the most fast-paced movie. Very creative. The creators have created an excellent colony of ants and bugs. I just love it.It's all about a crazy scientist bug ant traveling to the city to look for help to save the colony he's from, from a grasshopper gang. Hilarious all the way through it. The scientist bug screwing up in the start, offers to help and turns up with circus bugs. Hahahahaaa. Just watch it guys.A Pixar animation movie is worth the movie. I'll be definitely buying the DVD.",10,0,0,28 July 2008
The Dark Knight," Ultimately, the true Hero,.,
","Batman returns again as The Dark Knight to us. I saw this movie. It was completely worth the wait. The movie is Capital 'F'-*-*-*-i-n-g Capital 'A'-m-a-z-i-n-g. One of the darkest movie I ever saw. I don't want to disclose much here but, I'll try to give a synopsis without spoiling the movie. First of all, it's a long movie. The action sequences are proportioned very well. It has an amazing plot. Dialogues are crazily awesome. The screenplay, the best. The music, no comparison. The cast, well chosen. Christain Bale is a natural made Batman. Maggie Gynhalle (I dunno the name correctly) as Rachel is much much better than Katie Holmes. Heather Ledger as joker, The best. The director had done really an excellent job. My favorite about this movie is the Joker. Heather Ledger, he dido't act. He was playing himself. I am glad he turned out to be a good guy or else we would be facing the most dangerous evil psychopath in the world ever existed. The ending of the movie was awesome. Harvey Dent as The White Knight and Two-face was remarkable as well. It is one hell of a movie. It is an epic. It is a masterpiece. Don't ever miss this movie guys. Watch it. Just sit tight and watch it. And see how amazed you are. I am really interested to see how the third batman movie is going to come out. I don't know how they are going to manage to top this movie and this plot. I just don't know. I guess we have to wait and see.",10,5,12,12 August 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," An interesting movie so as to speak...
","I saw this movie on 12th. I would say this is the third best Harry Potter movie. The special effects are really awesome. So is the music. This movie much darker like the third one. If compared with the book, honestly, this movie is total crap.Dumbledore character sucked as usual. I didn't find final battle between Dumbledore and Tom as intense and interesting as I found it in the book. I mean, in the book I could visualize the entire battle and compared to that this was nothing. They added a lot of unwanted additional scenes. The script is like the movie is running very fast to reach the end as if the end of the world is nearing. A better choice could have made for Luna Lovegood character. I mean, her character is supposed to be weired and dizzy and carefree. But, Evana Lynch didn' portray these things. Also, her voice was childish. Someone at Emma Watson's age might have been a better choice. Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) was awesome as usual. And, so is Alan Rickman (Snape). The new addition Helena Bonham Carter (Bellatrix Lestrange) was awesome and freaking scary and Imelda Staunton (Dolores Umbridge) was good too. Even Bonnie Wright (Ginny Weasly) was good.I was a bit disappointed. I expected a better movie. I thought at least the last three movies might be 220 minutes like Lord Of The Rings Series. They modified the entire content of the movie and made it totally different from the book. I don't want to divulge any part of the movie here because some people might prefer movies rather than books. But, I prefer books. But it's worth watching for fun and special effects. Just don't expect it to be like the book nor very close to the book and watch. Watch it to enjoy and have fun. It's a 2-hr movie.Out of 10, I would give it a 6.2My order of movie rating in HP Series:-1. Sorcerer's Stone - 8/10 2. Chamber Of Secrets - 7.8/10 3. Goblet Of Fire - 7/10 4. Prisoner Of Azkaban - 6.5/105. Order Of Phoenix - 6.2/10",6,1,3,13 July 2007
Up," Up, Up, and still Pixar goes Up...
","I'm an avid Pixar fan and ever since it's first movie, Toy Story, I await eagerly for Pixar movies every year. I don't worry about what kind of movie it is going to be, but if it is Pixar then it's definitely going to watch-movie-for-sure list. Just look the improvements from the first to the latest. It's all refreshing. Simple stories. So simple, yet powerful. They create memories... no... they become a part of our memories as we experience them. The animation, the dialogs, the plot twists, the texture and the special effects brings life into each character and reality to the background portrayed. And, as I watched Up, I can imagine the hard-work, dedication and love put into this masterpiece. The movies before Up I keep them under the categories of comedies. But, Up is an exception. First, this movie is a drama, then it is a comedy. Yes, my friends. It is a drama first. Though, Wall-E is cute and moving, Up is emotional. The movie is true to its very soul. This movie actually brought tears. At times it lit up a smile on our faces in a way that is very understandable. Add a bit of action, adventure and humor to this drama and the resultant movie is a true masterpiece. Pixar always manages to surprise and amaze us in a way no animation movie ever could. As you can see that I am not mentioning even one scene from movie, it's because it is not a movie to be explained nor said, but truly a movie to be watched and experienced.Pixar has done it again. The magic still exists. As always, Pixar rules the world of animation. I give it a 10. No questions, asked. The movie deserves it totally...",10,1,2,28 June 2010
How to Train Your Dragon," An amazing experience...
","Wow. I never thought there would be a movie that equals the quality of Pixar. This movie is truly a challenge for those great Pixar movies. Dreamworks finest animation movie. Way better than Shrek. The best movie they made. When people animations they mostly make it with lots of comedy with a drama thrown in here and there. The proportion between comedy and drama is a feat achieved by none other than Pixar until now. Yes, I can honestly say that this movie is Dreamworks masterpiece.I would place this movie under the category of adventure/drama rather comedy/drama. From the beginning to the end the movie keeps you hooked up with fantastic landscapes filled with rich beautiful colors and top-notch animation. I can clearly see with how much passion was this movie crafted with. Likable and enjoyable characters. Simple yet top-notch dialogs. Revised concept yet, unique and refreshing in its own way. Even those simple scenes like eye-contact engulf you with emotion. And, of course there is one huge plus for the movie. The background musical score.John Powell is the man. His musical scored is layered and blended beautifully and succeed in bringing out the emotions even more. Also, the music sticks to your heart for days. Just like Pixar Dreamworks had finally made a film worthy of Oscar. I just hope just like the evolution of Pixar in making better and better movies, Dreamwork with start making better and better movies. A high praise for the animators who have done an excellent job on animating the dragons through a mixture of emotions and expressions and for the characters as well. A rounding applause for the voice casting. I don't care about the Scottish and English accent. They did a wonderful job in bringing characters to life.A true masterpiece done with such artistry and passion. I hope this movie get at least one Oscar.Boy, I wish I had a dragon to ride.",10,0,0,14 March 2011
The Descent," Falling into complete darkness..
","The third movie to scare me. A brilliant horror/thriller movie since 'The Ring'. Very simple story. Excellent cast. Beautiful locations. Awesome creepy cave. At one scene I jumped out of my seat. It really shocked the hell out of me. I really didn't expect that. Watch this movie. You won't regret it. From start to end it will keep you on the edge of the seat. This movie is very creepy and has some good gory scenes that would be rather disturbing. The plot and screenplay are very good. The ending was unexpected. Don't expect me to go more into the movie. NO WAY. If you wanna know more, go and watch it. It's worth watching.",8,1,3,17 July 2007
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A Magical delight...
","I saw this movie and I was very much impressed. Chris Columbus had really captured the magic with his amazing creativity. He takes us to a wonderful journey through the magical community. The cast was perfect. The Music was really awesome. The theme song really had the magic in it. Awesome visual effects. The movie was beautifully taken. It had all the elements, the humor, the happiness, the darkness, the sadness and the magic. The movie is as good as the book. My favorite part is the chess under the trapdoor.A movie definitely worth watching. Trust me, you'll enjoy it. Hats off to Chris Columbus and J.K.Rowling for creating this wonderful magical world.I give this movie an 8 for 10.",8,0,1,11 January 2008
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Impressive, yet not to the standard...
","This movie, I saw it on the first day with high expectations after seeing the trailer. But, not up to the mark. They tweaked the story from the book here and there. As usual the trio did well. But, why Michael Gambon behaving like that. He expresses so much anger all times. C'on man. Read the book. Get to know Dumbledore's character first. I still prefer the book. Special effects-wise, this movie is a treat.If you have read the book, probably you won't enjoy the movie that much. Those who haven't would like this movie.Out of 10, I would give this movie a rating of 7. My order of movie rating in HP Series:- 1. Sorcerer's Stone - 8/10 2. Chamber Of Secrets - 7.8/10 3. Goblet Of Fire - 7/10 4. Prisoner Of Azkaban - 6.5/10",7,0,2,11 January 2008
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Hisssssssssss saaa heeyyshaaa hissssaaahissss (Splendid Work in parseltongue)...
","I really enjoyed this movie, but good enough like the first one. Still I enjoyed the movie. Richard was awesome as Dumbledore as usual. The trio did well too. The best part I liked about this movie is Moaning Myrtle. She's awesome.This movie was a bit darker than the first one. The visuals are really good. Awesome music score. A well made sequel. The choices made for Lockhart and Lucius Malfoy was perfect. The day today day incidents happenings in a wizard's house was shown very well in Ron's house. The best thing in the house is the clock.A 7.8 out of 10 rated movie. Watch this and enjoy the movie.My order of movie rating in HP Series:- 1. Sorcerer's Stone - 8/10 2. Chamber Of Secrets - 7.8/10",7,0,1,11 January 2008
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Let's Rock 'N Roll...
","Well, first things first. Plot-wise, movie sucks. The only minor part.Now to the main course. This movie is a clear block buster winner. Much better than the first one. Big Robots. Big Action scenes. Very funny comedy scenes. The acting was much better than the first one. Excellent and amazing special effects and animations. Nice cinematography. Very good music score too. Very well paced. Action, comedy and tragedy was evenly proportioned.This is a movie to be watched on bigger screen. Don't wait till the DVD comes out (though it's definitely coming to my DVD collection). Don't go with expectations like there's a big plot behind it. It's a summer movie. It's a hang with your friends, eat popcorn, drink sodas and have fun kinda movie. I was laughing my a** of in this one and momentarily stunned by the action sequences. I... I in fact enjoyed it a lot. It was fun to watch. That's the whole point of a movie. To have fun and it certainly lives up-to it.In short, it's an awesome, f*****g mind blowing movie.I give it a 8.3/10...",8,18,31,1 July 2009
Love Actually," Heart-warming, Emotional...
",The director had given a wonderful movie to the world. Love is all around. There can be no life without love. The movie tells about the different kinds of love.The cast is good. The humor is good. The open-mindness of Liam with Sam is good. Everyone had done their jobs well.The music score is best. It made me feel throughout the movie. It made me smile. It made me laugh. It made me sad. It made me cry. It made me cry and laugh together.Altogether it's a great experience. I give this movie a 9/10.Learn to Love. Live to Love.,9,0,2,30 October 2007
August Rush," A Musical Delight
","This is probably one of the best musical film I have seen next to the Sound of Music. I loved it. I don't care what others think. This movie is definitely up to my satisfaction. It gave a new perspective towards music. The music really out the feelings from inside of. The plot is very simple. It's about a kid trying to find his parents through music.There are some plot holes, but the music pushed them aside. It was magical, beautiful, powerful and an emotional movie. You could feel the tears in your eyes. Robin Williams was awesome, though others performed well too.If you like musicals, I definitely recommend this. A movie worth watching. I give this movie a 8.4 out of 10.",8,0,2,7 February 2008
Inception," Inception is not a deception...
","The Nolan brothers are at their best.This is a movie not to be missed. This is how one should make an action movie where the plot matters the most. The best movie I saw since The Dark Knight. Yes, best since then. No movie had left me wanting for more. Nolan brothers have done it again. After seeing this wonderful masterpiece I am compelled to review. Ever since I saw Memento, I decided that if a movie by Nolan brothers is coming out, then it's a must watch.This is the next most complicated script I have seen next to Memento (by Nolan brothers). What makes their movie so special and innovative ? It's the script, direction and class-A dialogs. Yes, if you are watching a Nolan brothers movie better pay attention. And this movie needs the highest attention. Miss one bit and you will end up confused wondering how you got there. The movie starts with a layout explaining all the basic elements in the first 1 hr. Once the action part kicks you'll be glued to the screen praising and awing scene after scene. At the end, the movie will leave you to figure the conclusion on your own. In short, it will make you think about the complexity of sub-conscious human mind.Leonardo Di Caprio gives a solid awesome performance in handling the weight and pressure of human emotions. Next best performance is given by Marian Cortilard. Ellen Page does a fair job and so do the other supporting characters. The direction, a complete genius, Christopher Nolan is. Every scene and layer will keep you stunned momentarily. Music, though it sounded like more like Batman, seemed to fit well for this movie, hence I loved it. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie receives an Oscar and so rightly it deserves one and more than one.In short, Inception is not a deception. It goes well beyond all the hype and expectations.Thank you, the Nolan brothers...",10,3,9,6 August 2010
WALL·E," Wow... I... Wow... Simply Wow...
","Wall-E...Well, if you haven't seen this film, it's about time you watch it... Wow, what an artist movie! Just watch the magic of Pixar. I simply adore Wall-E and Eve (and of course the Forger Contaminent). Now, who can top Pixar in making the Best Animated-Films ? A simple story. One Robot falling in Love with another Robot. And, how cute they are and how perfectly they match ? No dialogs in this movie. Pixar has again done an excellent job in emoting the robots. There are some very spectacular scenes. The dance between Eve and Wall-E in space was spell-binding, charming and enchanting. Now, I really want to learn to dance.The best part about this movie is that it's so original and unique in every aspect. Top-notch animation and special effects till to this day. Beautiful music score. Artistic camera work and editing.In short, it's an emotional movie. It's a movie that will touch everybody inside their heart.Hat's off to Pixar and the entire crew who dedicated their hard-work in making one of the best movies in the history of Film Industry. This movie will never be forgotten. It'll definitely stand out. It's an artistic masterpiece. It'll be talked about for years.Hahaha, I just simply love and adore Wall-E and Eve...",10,1,4,6 January 2009
Iron Man," It's so ironic for the evil side...
","Well, I wouldn't say it comes along the lines of the best superheroes movie like the 'The Dark Knight', but, it's worth watching. It's quite entertaining and very good. I would say it's in the league of 'Spider-man' movies.Very good CGI effects and 3D graphics. A simple plot. I guess it's because it's just an intro movie to Iron Man. I hope they have a strong plot for the second one. Robert Dowrney gives an amazing performance. My favorite part of the movie is the ending...Just watch it guys. It's full of clichés. But it's fun-filled action movie...",8,3,6,27 December 2008
Bruce Almighty," A movie for entire family and mankind...
","Honestly, I don't believe in God's existence. But, I believe in the message this trying tell us.This is quite a remarkable movie in a nutshell. The story is simple. A man having bad luck one after the other. He really gets angry on the God. The God (Morgan Freeman) comes to him in human form, hand him his powers to see whether he can do the job better than him. In the end, he understands the true meaning of life.Bruce (Jim Carrey) at his best as usual. The scene where Bruce makes Evan Baxter read the news is the best. I was literally in tears and laughing my ass off. This is a very good comedy movie for an entire family to watch. Morgan Freeman as God also did a splendid job. He was perfect for the role. This movie not just has humor alone. It has a very good message. The people around us in this world were so absorbed into their own things and money and jobs and so on, but forgot to feel their inner nature, humanity. But, it's about humanity. Caring for others. Put the others in front of you. It deals with mankind. Bruce might have a job he doesn't like, but, instead he has something he likes more than his own life, Grace (Jenifer Aniston).I would recommend this movie if you haven't seen it. It's a very good very movie and is going to come into my personal collection.",8,1,2,10 January 2008
A Walk to Remember," So pure... So perfect... So romantic...
","This movie is an excellent blend of Landon Carter's (Shane West) love for Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore) and his issues with his father, Dr.Carter. It is impossible for not to fall in love with Mandy Moore. She gives an excellent performance in this movie. Slow movie, but very romantic. The background score is awesome. Merwyn Warren had wonderfully brought out the emotions through his music. The author Nicholas Sparks has given a wonderful journey to love. I fell in love instantly with the movie when Mandy Moore said this line, 'Do not fall in Love with me'.It was so moving that I cried at some parts. I felt the pain of Jamie and Landon in this movie. I felt the happiness. I felt the love. I felt the miracle. Watch this movie and you'll know what I mean. You'll love it. You won't regret it.",10,2,4,1 August 2007
Slumdog Millionaire," A Wonderful Indian Experience...
","I was waiting to watch this movie for sometime and finally I had a chance to see it.First off all, this movie is not an Indian movie as many of my friends keep asking me whether have I seen this movie. It's a British movie made in India. A wonderfully made film exploring the slums of India. I was momentarily entranced by it. A.R.Rahman as a musician excels in his composing. Cinematography was awesome. A brilliantly, very well written script. Lots of new faces who have performed brilliantly. The movie moves at a wonderful pace. Totally original. The comedy at times were good too. Hahahaaa, destiny is really a funny thing.A touch of the darkness inside India. This movie totally deserves those 8 Oscars. Anyone who sees this film would want to visit the country. If you have not seen this movie yet, well what are you waiting for ? Watch it people. It's worth the money. Definitely going into my DVD collection.I give a 9.3 out of 10.",9,1,8,24 May 2009
