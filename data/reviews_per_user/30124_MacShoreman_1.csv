"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Does not need to be glorious to be splendid!
","I seen this movie 3 times since it was released. First time on the theater, second when I bought the DVD and third just minutes ago when I found it among my other DVD's. I enjoyed it every time I saw it and every time I think I liked it even more and more. Schwimmer found the every day pulse in the lives of the people portrayed in the movie and got it on the camera. The actors seams to have played their parts with such ease that it almost feels under acted. Not said in a negative way, the opposite. The whole production comes out as a genuine warm movie that brings that sweet feel to the audience without becoming Disney ultra sweet. It is nice but not in the negative way. This is a story about ordinary people with ordinary problems, pieces missing from their life puzzle. It is the tale about how small pieces of the puzzle can make things so much brighter even if it is the smallest ones that one by one is fitted in place. It also points out that most of the times it is up to our selves to do what is needed to get the pieces in place. The Marathon race becomes a perfect, easy to relay to, metaphor for that. Brilliant acting, good direction, many well shot scenes and a perfect sense of British humor brings out a movie well worth it. It is a joy to see Pegg work, his interaction with the other actors and the script. He has a complete grip of the personality of Dennis and brings him to life in a balanced way. Despite some scenes that could have been left out that did not bring anything to the movie or the story it is telling, this movie gets 10/10 from me. It is the total experience when seeing it in the right moment and right mood that makes this movie a gem.",10,0,2,6 September 2013
