Ali," Better than average Bio-pic
","While it obviously could be referred to as a boxing picture, this nice Michael Mann biographical effort is more a character study of the one of the most charismatic figures ever to step into the squared circle. Mr. Mann shifts gears appropriately from his heavy action yarns (Thief, Last of the Mohicans, Heat) to provide an insightful look into the life of this legendary boxer as Will Smith pulls off the title role rather well yet regrettably holds back much of the wit, humor and unpredictable antics Ali was known for. As a result, viewer's eyes actually will be more fixated on the dynamite supporting cast including Ron Silver as Ali's longtime trainer Angelo Dundee and Mario Van Peebles playing a formidable Malcolm X. Both of these memorable characters are only to be outdone by an almost unrecognizable Jon Voight as he dons the patented yellow ABC sport jacket and gives an incredible, Oscar nominated performance as the exuberant and controversial Howard Cosell who always seemed to be where Ali roamed the globe. While the film does span 10 years of the famous boxer's life, the major disappointment of the film is the 157 minute which could have been shortened by needles/monotonous training footage sequences.",Null,0,0,9 April 2002
Spider-Man," In the still of the night, at the scene of a crime...
","Anxiously awaited by both comic and cartoon fans alike, Sam Raimi brings the extremely popular 'Spider-man' to life on the big screen which is true-to-form and a very rewarding rendition of this much adored action hero. Tobey Maguire is perfectly cast and admirably pulls off the dual role of shy newsboy by day, crime-fighter extraordinaire by night with style and grace. Kirsten Dunst is equally endearing as Spidey's gal pal as there are more than one Kodak moments shared between the two which no doubt will be archived in cinematic annals if romance fans have their vote. Yet it is the title character's battle with the arch-enemy Green Goblin, effectively played by veteran actor Willem Dafoe, which provides the many suspenseful twists and turns evidenced in their high-flying acrobatic dealings courtesy of STA CGI. While the much welcomed side plot involving Spider-man's subdued alter-ego (the mild mannered newsboy Peter Parker) adds additional intrigue as he entangles with envious friend and rival Robert Franco for the affection of sweetheart Dunst, it is the humorous (borderline silly but still funny) antics provided by J.K. Simmons as Peter Parker's Daily Bugle boss that contributes a huge amount of laughs in this enjoyable adventure that certainly sets the standard for first rate comic book to big screen transitions.",Null,0,0,31 May 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Star-studded romp
",Slick and entertaining film that's packed with energetic players and wonderful direction courtesy of Steven Soderburgh. George Clooney and Brad Pitt lead a very likable and humorous crew on a what's perceived as an impossible heist from a Las Vegas casino have security which on a par with Fort Knox. The team assembled is certainly shady given their tarnished backgrounds (accomplished via impressive flashback clips and clever montage sequences which are informative as they are entertaining) and couldn't have less in common personality-wise yet collectively gel into a well-oiled machine which convince you their mission could actually be attainable. Even with the given skeletons present in their respective pasts you still find yourself rooting for these 'bad' guys. Andy Garcia is great as the stooge and ultimate fall guy who gets a deserved comeupance and the added tension of Clooney's team attempting to pull off the caper with unexpected hurdles makes the confusion and chaos a more than welcomed plot entanglement. Great shots of Vegas throughout - especially the night sequences - and Julia Roberts is very graceful as the independent gal caught in between two demanding men.,Null,0,0,9 April 2002
A Beautiful Mind," Engrossing film
","This is an outstanding motion picture telling the powerful story of the rise & fall, then subsequent triumphant rise again of Dr. John Nash. Russell Crowe is outstanding as the compelling lead. Film is visually stunning throughout as it covers over 40 years of Nash's amazing brilliant and often tragic life; a sincere tribute to a genuinely unique and interesting life struggle. Jennifer Connelly delivers a memorable performance as well giving brave portrayal of Nash's wife, which earned her a well-deserved Oscar in the female lead category. Yet the major credit for this well-crafted motion picture is the inventive collaboration of director Ron Howard's vision with the skilled production talents of Brian Grazer who took home Oscar that same year for Best Director and Best Picture respectively. Through their collective efforts they utilized Akiva Goldsman's Oscar winning screenplay in a clever and imaginative way to transform this sympathetic yet complex story into a delightful, pleasing to the eye treat that will engage all that screen this powerful biography of a brilliant yet flawed professor.",10,0,1,9 April 2002
Vanilla Sky," The 'Vanilla' Sky is the limit
","A film which makes an attempt to pattern itself on the fantasy vs. reality films that had become popular at the turn of the new millennium - David Fichner's 'Fight Club' and M. Night Shamalan's 'Sixth Sense' both from 1999, Christopher Nolan's 'Momento' from 2000, and David Lynch's 'Mulholland Drive' released the following year (all of which don't surpass the reigning king of this genre when Terry Gilliam released his 1985 masterpiece 'Brazil') - by no means fails in this respect since I found it both entertaining and intriguing for the most part, but is noticeably long and certainly may confuse the average '2hr-max-movie-goer'. Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz both stand out playing their respective, 'good gal/bad gal roles and Jason Lee is quite appealing as the best friend of our dashing lead Tom Cruise. Yet Cruise may be viewed as stretching this performance given the physical challenges that are demanded. I hesitate to reveal these challenges to those that have not seen the picture as they are indeed the focal point of the plot. Many good things like the witty Cameron Crowe retrospective soundtrack that is weaved into clever culture references and tributes which are indeed enjoyable and even necessary to solve the riddle presented in 'what's is going on?' scenario of the main character's pressing dilemma which may not be easy to access with a single viewing. But still the ride can be entertaining as Tom runs away and into trouble as he often does in quasi-action films that are laced with mystery and intrigue like Sydney Pollack's 1993 'The Firm', Brian De Palma's 1996 'Mission Impossible' and even the more cerebrally dark, 'Eyes Wide Shut' from Stanley Kubrick. As noted by many educated critics as well as the tasteless tabloids Mr. Cruise may be biting off more than he can chew as he dives into the land of independent production. I applaud Tom for his efforts and are rooting for his 'comeback' yet do believe that his choice for future roles should include a return to comedic territory as a deviation/diversion to selecting elaborate/complicated efforts which could be prove a bit too risky and result in a poor reception at the box office.",Null,0,0,9 April 2002
Hart's War," Worth a view
",Interesting twist to the standard WWII POW fare which instead cleverly showcases the racial card as a ploy to the real objective of the film which is not revealed until the final reel. Willis does play the 'so-called' hero but not how we 'general'ly think.,Null,0,0,9 April 2002
