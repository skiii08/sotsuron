Blade Runner 2049," An artful unapologetic sequel
","The massive scale and audacity of this film cannot be overstated. Blade Runners 2049 is a revolutionary film ahead of it's time. A revolt against making movies approachable to the masses- this film stays true to the franchise with unflinching loyalty. The Blade runner franchise takes an unflinching look into what it means to be human and, rather than make a clumsy attempt at answering questions has the confidence to leave them mysterious. Blade Runner is hardcore science fiction, and 2049 is a brave reach forward that should have been at least considered for a best picture nomination. This film is exactly what it's supposed to be, despite a lukewarm reception from the casual moviegoers. Frankly, this film is not for them. This is a methodical and bleak narrative wrapped in magnificent visuals and excellent performances. 
This is existential art.",10,1,8,7 April 2018
Face_Off," Insane
","Quite possibly the most insane movie ever made. Words cannot describe the chaos that reigns in this movie. It's a movie that's good at what it's doing, but I have no idea what this movie is doing. Action is taken to such a ridiculous level that the opening sequence would easily be the finale of most normal action movies. No brakes. Nothing subtle. The acting is so far over the top it begins to mock itself in it's own twisted reality warping psychosis. Direction? Is some mutant offspring of Japanese anime and American 80's action? I think. So may insane things happen so suddenly and without logic, and you have no time to process any of it. You just yell 'what!?' at the screen over and over again. Story? Plot? Backstory? Logical development? Shut up nerd! No time for that! Here's even more action! Go ahead ask someone to explain what you just saw... too late! This other random thing just happened. This is Face/Off. Deal with it.",8,3,5,31 October 2016
