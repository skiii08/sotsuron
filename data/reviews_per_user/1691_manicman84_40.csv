Walk the Line," an excellent romance, but not so good biopic
","Walk The Line is a generic biopic about a great country star, Johnny Cash. The storyline is really predictable due to the fact that the film follows the same formula as other movies of that type. Thus, at the beginning we have traumatic childhood, then difficulties in the road to big career, development of the career, problems with drugs and numerous breakdowns and finally redemption, coming back to glory. Throughout the movie I had a feeling that I'm dealing with 2nd part of Ray. The flick, like most of the films which attempts to present the whole life of the figure, is very episodic and does not show thoroughly real dilemmas of an artist or creation of his work (songs in this case). In this respect Capote visibly surpasses Walk the Line. However, the film undoubtedly works as a touching love story. Not only do Jaquin Pheonix (Johnny Cash) and Reese Witherspoon (June Carter) play great, but there is also a real chemistry between them on the screen. There are also some marvellous scenes in which they sing together on the scene. Nonetheless, in my opinion Felicity Huffman for her superb performance in Transamerica should won the Oscar instead of Reese to whom I took a liking after this flick. Moreover, Mangold efficiently directs and the pacing is good. To sum up, the reception of Walk The Line depends mainly on your expectations. It's an excellent romance, but not so good biopic.",7,1,2,11 August 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," ingenious crime pic with surprising twists
","Lucky Number Slevin is a crime thriller with well-known actors and hilarious names of characters. Jason Smilovic has provided screenplay with enigmatic, precisely planned plot. The storyline is quite convoluted, but not to such an extent that an average viewer could not understand it. The dialogue is witty and quotable. In addition, to my astonishment Paul McGuigan (director of dull The Wicker Park) directs efficiently and keeps a fast pace throughout the film, which is to my mind crucial in this kind of flicks. The well-casted actors did a great job. In particular, Sir Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman are amazing as leaders of gangs fighting each other. Josh Hartnett also plays surprisingly well and convincingly. Among the minor vices of the film one can rate: an unnecessary love thread and a bit unoriginal (but surprising) plot. All in all, Lucky Number Slevin is an ingenious crime pic with numerous surprising twists.",8,0,2,11 August 2006
The Hangover," delivers more than enough laughs by keeping the comic tension tight all the way through
","The Hangover takes a standard premise and turns it into a hilarious comedy that combines raunchy humor with 'what's going to be next' mystery. After the crazy bachelor party, the three guys can't remember virtually anything about what actually has happened and where the groom can be. This simple concept appears to be very productive and the team of screenwriters squeezes all the juice out of it providing plenty of laugh-out-loud scenes. The humor not only stems from frequently absurd situations the guys come across, but also their mostly hilarious interactions. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis make for a great comedy trio playing characters of totally different personalities. Phil (Cooper) is a party animal; Stu (Helms) is a pragmatist; and Alan (Galifianakis) seems to live in his own bizarre world. They all bring different elements to the film. Galifianakis is especially hilarious delivering totally unhinged, yet perfectly likable performance. Even though The Hangover is not sufficiently heartfelt or powerful to be a classic in my book, it still delivers more than enough laughs by keeping the comic tension tight all the way through.",8,1,2,25 March 2010
United 93," excellent homage to the victims of every terrorist attack
","United 93 is an extremely important movie on highly sensitive subject of terrorist attacks which took place on the 11th of September, 2001. However, important doesn't always mean good. It's relatively easy to shoot a pompous flick using cheap tricks in order to arouse strong emotions among the audience. After the screening, I can say that United 93 isn't and even does not try to be this kind of film. Director/screenwriter Paul Greengrass depicts dramatic events by the application of documentary style through the entire film. The film is shot solely with the use of hand-held cameras. Although at the beginning its chaotic style is hard to swallow, with time it appears to be an ideal solution to portray a tragedy in a credible, thorough way. The fact that the cast comprises of practically unknown actors is also of great importance. Thanks to daring formal measures, we are under the impression that we're really among those people on a plane. Continually vibrating camera gradually triggers off anxiety and almost unbearable tension. Greengrass rises to the occasion and directs with great reverence and restraint all the way to the completely devastating ending which leaves viewers speechless and the picture turns out to be a rewarding experience. To conclude, United 93 is simultaneously an incredibly powerful, intense movie and excellent homage to the victims of every terrorist attack. Therefore, the viewing is essential.",10,1,3,23 September 2006
Star Trek," a sci-fi adventure movie at its peak
","My opinion on the new 'Star Trek' doesn't really differ from the general one. J.J. Abrams succeeded in making a reboot that's both fresh and respectful to its source material. He didn't experiment with the new technologies or complex narrative, but conveyed the dynamic, yet totally comprehensible storyline intersected by numerous allusions to the old series. You don't need to be a trekkie to fully enjoy this movie that can be described as humorous, fast-paced and universally gripping. The action sequences are never less than awe-inspiring. The transformation of James T. Kirk is entirely believable and unforced. Chris Payne is great in this role, just as practically everyone from the distinguishable supporting cast. 'Star Trek' can be considered a sci-fi adventure movie at its peak, still it lacks certain kind of depth and emotion to be truly remarkable for me. Nevertheless, it's without any trace of doubt an essential viewing even for people who have not been particularly interested in this saga before.",8,3,8,25 March 2010
Inglourious Basterds," a bit unsure of what it wants to be, but in the end you can't help enjoying this ridiculous hybrid of a movie
","It's a totally unhinged fantasy on the events of World War II, a provocative film that uses the serious theme of war to tell the story by means of exploitation cinema to the point that I can imagine some people really insulted by it. 'Inglorious Basterds' isn't a one-sided affair though as it can't be classified as a pure action B-movie. It's a more complicated flick than that blending ideological cinema with a suspenseful thriller mostly relying on the clever dialogue. There are moments in the movie when these overall three different aspects don't gel together very well. Largely inconsistent tone of the movie is more than redeemed by gripping, cringe-inducing sequences often involving Christoph Waltz in a star-making turn as contradiction-driven Col. Hans Landa. He even steals the show from supremely over-the-top Brad Pitt. It's a shame that masterly executed single scenes don't result in an equally superb movie. 'Inglorious Basterds' is a bit unsure of what it wants to be, but in the end you can't help enjoying this ridiculous hybrid of a movie.",8,1,6,25 March 2010
Coraline," outshines the competition creating jaw-dropping surreal backgrounds and astonishingly alive figurines
","Coraline has been created as a result of cooperation between animation genius Henry Selick (The Nightmare Before Christmas) and English iconic writer Neil Gaiman (the movie is based on his award-winning novella). The lovechild of these two individuals is a hypnotic stop-motion animated tale that combines old-fashioned storytelling and astonishing visuals. Selick approaches Gaiman's novella in an uncompromising way. While he adds his own elements to the story, he maintains the dark, gloomy atmosphere keeping 'horror' overtones in the right place. As for the plot, this is basically a new version of Alice in Wonderland. It can't be regarded as a shortcoming in this intricate fantasy though: Coraline is simply too engrossing for that. The main point of the movie that can be summarized by the tagline 'be careful what you wish for' realizes itself in a clever script being tight and well-paced with every detail relevant later in the movie. The characters are often freakishly bizarre, which fits the story perfectly and makes for some incredibly inventive scenes. The movie can be described as a triumph of imagination as Selick presents the spectacle enhanced by superb 3D effects. Selick outshines the competition creating jaw-dropping surreal backgrounds and astonishingly alive figurines. His level of precision and overall scope are just admirable. All in all, Coraline is exceptional in its depiction of wonders that traditional stop-motion technique of animation can bring.",9,0,0,22 March 2010
Ice Age: The Meltdown," much more intense and laughable than its predecessor
","'Ice Age: The Meltdown' clearly surpasses its predecessor. The follow-up is much more intense and laughable. This flick seemingly does not really differ from other sequels. It offers more characters, more action, more not always intelligent humor and more scenes with Scrat (funny squirrel which only occurred three times in the first part). However, in contrast to other sequels this film benefits from this 'more' factor as it becomes a movie practically for everybody (its predecessor was mainly meant for children). In this respect it's more similar to 'Shrek' than to the first part. Nevertheless, I'm not convinced as to the plot which is simply limited to one long trek and very typical message about the great power of friendship. In this case the emphasis is rightly placed on the hilarious characters, their adventures during the trip and at least good ideas to embroider the whole story. For instance, a female mammoth who thinks she is an opossum. Every main character practically has his/her own five minutes in the show. To sum up, 'Ice Age: The Meltdown' is another good flick aiming at the whole family.",7,0,0,11 August 2006
The Secret in Their Eyes," Although the film is artfully shot taking advantage of dazzling cinematography and set pieces, the story happens to be very conventional in its outcome
","The Secret In Their Eyes is an Argentinian entry in this year's best foreign picture race at Oscars. Juan Jose Campanella may be an acclaimed director in his country, but his combination of murder mystery, romance and drama just wears thin being nothing more than ordinary. Although the film is artfully shot taking advantage of dazzling cinematography and set pieces, the story happens to be very conventional in its outcome. Besides, the narrative is far from gripping that is the result of subpar writing and unmemorable performances by actors. I was never particularly enthralled with the exception of two subsequent scenes. The first involves a superbly directed chase after a presumed murderer at the stadium, while the second showcases his hilarious interrogation in which his manhood is being questioned by a female investigator. These are the only sequences that really stand out in this overall boring movie that struggles to make any impression on you throughout its running time. Even somewhat surprising ending doesn't help. 5/10 (C)",5,9,51,21 March 2010
"I Love You, Man"," abounds with hilarious social observations and funny, yet authentic dialogue
","'I Love You, Man' is a hilarious comedy composed of all too familiar elements. However, instead of focusing on a conventional inter-gender relationship, it deals with male bonding complete with its challenges and rewards. Paul Rudd stars as Peter Klaven, a real estate agent who is about to marry soon. When he realizes he doesn't have any real friend to be his best man during the wedding, he starts his quest for platonic man-love. After many failed endevours, he meets Sydney Fife (Jason Segel) who happens to have the perfect traits to be his friend for life. This is not a Judd Apatow movie, but on the whole it feels like one. Witer/director John Hamburg and co-writer Larry Levine combine physical humour with hilarious social observations and funny, yet authentic dialogue. They don't forget to spice the flick with some pop-culture references which involve Hulk from the TV series, Lou Ferringo and the adoration of both characters for prog-rock legends Rush (!). Besides, the movie is very well paced delivering just enough laughs that are perfectly grounded in reality and so immensely relatable. 'I Love You, Man' can also be characterized by means of its amazing central performances. Paul Rudd approaches anxiety and social awkwardness with deadpan delivery, while Jason Segel strikes the right mark with his cool, goofy and irresistibly charismatic character without ever being too silly or cartoonish.",9,2,3,25 March 2010
The Prestige," this stylish thriller perfectly works on many levels
","The Prestige is a stylish thriller, story about obsession, magic trick and metaphor of a film art at the same time. Thanks to director Christopher Nolan (Memento, Batman Begins) the movie perfectly works on every level. On the most obvious level - it is a superbly shot thriller keeping in a heart-pounding suspense with numerous twists and turns. As regards psychology, we have a dangerous obsession with searching for something new and an intense rivalry between two different personalities, which is reliable owing to excellent performances by two leads - Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman. Their characters are not only obsessed with personal ambitions, but they also resign from family life by hurting people they love. In the allegorical sense, the flick is an overt metaphor of the magic trick in which creators show more things than actually communicate and viewers' aim is to decipher a riddle. Besides, they often reveal secrets concerning the enchantment. Finally, Nolan focuses on a labourious creation process. Filmmakers, just like illusionists in this movie, do everything within their power in order to amuse viewers and the effect is sometimes incommensurate to their hard work and devoted time. To conclude, The Prestige is a first-rate cinematic experience which both criticizes and glorifies film-making.",9,2,3,31 January 2007
Silent Hill," pointless and poorly developed
","I don't know about what are thinking creators of game adaptations. Let's just say that the best game adaptation in my opinion is Resident Evil and this film, is only a passable, brainless entertainment. It seems that creators of films based on video games have still no clue that a movie is completely different type of medium than video game. As a result, they produce either films so closely related to video games that unbearable or insipid movies which have almost nothing in common with the game (Doom), which probably stems from ignorance of adapted game. Silent Hill belongs to the first category. I have no idea what screenwriter has provided for the film as it has practically no plot. Director Christopher Gans uses only some plot points which are so illogical even for the horror flick about supernatural phenomena. At first, why does Rose DaSilva bring her child to Silent Hill? Why does policeman chase her? ... The film doesn't give any answers and, in addition, 'the story' is so poorly developed that even actors, who plays usually well, do badly here. In consequence, the film becomes a dull and unbearable experience. The facts that Silent Hill town is very atmospheric as well as both set design and special effects are good unfortunately don't save this pointless pic. What also makes bad impression is quite confusing ending which buries the film even more. All in all, you had better play once again the same game instead of watching this trashy movie. Don't trust promising trailer.",3,9,16,25 August 2006
Nacho Libre," moderately enjoyable thanks to Jack Black
","Nacho Libre is a silly comedy about a friar who follows his dreams and wears mask to moonlight as a wrestler, 'luchador'. Most of the ideas and gags in the film are ridiculous and characters are more cartoon-ish than flesh and blood. It's that kind of comedy which you can love or hate as it uses very specific kind of humor. I must admit that I moderately enjoyed it. Director Jared Hess applies mainly slapstick and numerous funny characters appear. It is obvious that Jack Black has a huge comedy talent and he possessed this rare ability to amuse viewers by only one look or gesture. Without him, the film surely wouldn't be so laughable. The supporting actors are well-casted, but they do not make such an impression as Black. Furthermore, the movie isn't dead funny. Obviously, in comparison to other comedies produced nowadays Hess' flick stands comparison and even surpasses most of them. However, the screenplay should be better developed and more complete. There is only a little bond between threads and the movie seems to be a collection of separate episodes at some points. Moreover, the movie is aimed especially at kids who should be pleased by all the undemanding jokes. All in all, Nacho Libre is a bit disappointing flick that is definitely saved by Jack Black's great performance.",6,0,0,11 October 2006
Shutter Island," undone by its lazy, messy and full of its own importance script
","The latest picture from Martin Scorsese ranks among his worst. Shutter Island tries to be an engrossing mystery, but the movie is just undone by its lazy, messy and full of its own importance script. A somewhat reasonable concept gets lost in an abundance of surrealism and nonsense. Both director and leading actor Leonardo DiCaprio aren't really at the top of their game. The latter just wanders around the island trying to reveal the conspiracy and meeting strange characters whose talk is puzzling and fractured. What's even worse, less than half way through it becomes apparent that the film can only resolve in one way enabling its used-to-death twist to enliven and assure viewers that the film makes no sense whatsoever. It's only a shame that the actors involved are respectable. Another reason why this film is a misfire is that it doesn't really try to be grounded in reality of any kind. It resembles an artificial construct, sadly not very exciting to watch.",4,2,6,25 March 2010
The Devil Wears Prada," most likely the best comedy of the year
","The Devil Wears Prada is the biggest surprise and will be most likely the best comedy of the year. It seems that the film has achieved not only financial success (over 120 million bucks only in the US), but also artistic one, which is extremely rare nowadays. Journalism graduate, Andrea has just been hired to be a 2nd assistant in a legendary Runway magazine devoted to fashion. Her psychotic chief, Miranda Priestly seems to do everything within her power to humiliate and fire Andy. The film is not another over-the-top chick flick. In fact, one may even refer to Devil Wears Prada as an intriguing and funny battle of cultures, in which people from different backgrounds and with different priorities participate. The writing always goes in the right directions as choices that screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna makes are never wrong. The movie unfolds smoothly and during the 2nd half, director David Frankel applies, aside from humour, also some moving drama-like scenes as Andy has to take important decision. Besides, the flick contains loads of unforced, mainly verbal and situational humour, which absolutely cannot be classified as stupid. Both humour and drama are superbly combined by director who captures losses and sacrifices of workers. The Oscar-worthy acting is a real highlight of this pic. Spontaneous Anne Hathaway is at the beginning sweet and later transforms into elegant chick who tries to make ends meet in his private life. As always great Meryl Streep is simply perfect as a cold editor barking comments with a sense of superiority. What's more, supportive roles are also outstanding. Stannley Tucci displays his comedic talent by delivering some smart one-liners. Emily Blunt is also great in displaying her fear for loony Priestly. All in all, skipping Devil Wears Prada is very unwise decision.",9,1,2,23 September 2006
Watchmen," a nearly flawless attempt at visualizing an outstanding novel
","The movie is set in 1980s alternate reality when the position of superheroes is decreasing and a serious possibility of atomic war with Russia emerges. This is a fascinating, multi-layered story benefiting from more than stellar Snyder's direction. With the aid of cinematographer Larry Fong, he captures the unique style of the graphic novel. The movie looks mindblowing being perfectly staged and conceived. There are plenty of captivating slo-mo fight sequences that along with graphic violence are Snyder's trademark. The opening montage is especially unforgettable. Snyder also illustrates some crucial scenes with songs that work as brilliant pop-culture references. The performances are often spot-on with Jackie Earle Haley totally nailing the multi-dimensional psyche of Rorschach and Patrick Wilson who's great displaying more confident version of Nite Owl II. Overall, 'Watchmen' is a nearly flawless attempt at visualizing an outstanding novel, it's an appropriately complex, brutal, and dark spectacle.",9,0,3,25 March 2010
Lilo & Stitch," charming and ingenious
","Although the animation is traditional, 'Lilo and Stitch' is quite modern and refreshing movie. It has a charm characteristic to previous Disney productions combined with a really ingeniously-done action (the beginning and the end of the flick). Every single character is lovable - moving and hilarious at the same time. Stitch is a character which matches all the icons from classic animated films and one can utter its name along with Shrek or Duffy Duck. A very typical for such pictures message - the glorification of the family is given in a touching way and does not spoil an enormous fun. The script is full of interesting, a bit surrealistic ideas and funny dialogues. This movie is a worthy addition to the best productions of Walt Disney studio. I definitely recommend it to the whole family.",8,5,6,11 August 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," skillfully constructed gore flick
","After 'High Tension' my expectations regarding Aja's next movie was very high. I feel fully satisfied and I think that followers of extremely brutal gore flicks from the 1970s will be as well. 'The Hills Have Eyes' is a remake of Was Craven's classic slasher. Even though the film is not an exact adaptation, it retains the climate of the original. Alike Aja's previous flick, this one keeps in incessant suspense and daring gory scenes occur, therefore it's not a film aiming at teenagers or people with weak stomach. Furthermore, the plot is well-developed and characters with their well-outlined traits are characteristic and likable. I only would rather they behaved more rationally in some scenes. For instance, the scene when the main hero leaves a gun by his victim is very hackneyed. Nevertheless, the transformation of the main hero who has to radically change his attitude to violence and become 'killing machine' is believable and fully explicable. 'The Hills Have Eyes' is also perfect from the technical side. The film is well-shot on desert location and both mutants' make-up and set design are abominable and great at the same time. All in all, every hardcore horror fan should see this flick.",8,3,4,11 August 2006
American Psycho," suspenseful thriller filled with dark humor
","American Psycho is a suspenseful thriller in which dark humor prevails over probability. The film works thanks to Christian Bale who gives an intriguing, convincing performance being, on a par with that in The Mechanist, the best in his career. His villain is incredibly degenerate due to the sick, aristocratic community in which he lives. His main hobby, apart from murdering of people in various ways, is listening music and talking about it, which leads to many hilarious situations in the film. What was also shrewdly used in the script are seemingly minor obsessions, like owning prettier business cards. The flick tears to shreds wealthy aristocratic environment which is responsible for arising sick atmosphere among people occupying the top positions as well as puts a question about individual's responsibility. Thus, the message is very similar to that in Woody Allen's Match Point. However, in American Psycho black humor is used instead of metaphorical meaning.",7,0,0,11 August 2006
Over the Hedge," shrewdly-made and engaging
","'Over The Hedge' maybe is not a breakthrough in animation, but I enjoyed this flick very much. The film certainly is not revealing as it broaches somehow a worn out subject of the importance of a family as an essential value in life. The plot is simple, but engaging. The creators implemented motives being well-known by average viewers in a rather shrewd way so as to entertain audience and keep them interested all the time. 'Over The Hedge' resembles 'Toy Story' and its sequel in this case. However, toys were replaced by cute little animals. As far as animals are concerned, there are immensely likable characters which make us involve in a story even more. The movie contains also hilarious scenes which, I must admit, do not evoke peals of laughter. For instance, Hammy, a squirrel from this flick is visibly less funny than Twitchy from 'Hoodwinked'. It appears that animated studios compete with each other who will create the most hilarious squirrel (bear in mind also this one from 'Ice Age'). Nevertheles, the jokes are quite graceful and do not embarrass creators in any way. This picture should definitely see both adults and children, but to my mind there are available far better animated films aiming at everyone.",7,0,0,11 August 2006
The White Ribbon," It just fails to be emotionally compelling.
","Widely regarded as the best European film of 2009, Michael Haneke's The White Ribbon centers on the birth of evil in pre-war Germany. A year before the breakout of the World War I a series of sudden accidents interferes with the peaceful life in one of German villages. This concept sounds much better on paper, and with Haneke's methodical approach The White Ribbon tends to be slow and mundane. Haneke cares more about concepts than characters. That's why he mechanically subordinates every event to his fatalistic thesis. To my surprise, it works really well introducing dense atmosphere of dread and tension into the film. While Haneke's examination seems relatively credible due to stark realism throughout the film, he keeps using his old tricks: the lack of climax and unresolved ending. They certainly worked way better in his metaphorical thriller Cache (Hidden) than in The White Ribbon that would benefit from the strong filmmaker's statement in the end. On the top of that, the latest Haneke's offering represents an artistic cinema with impressive cinematography, detailed set pieces and lavish compositions. It's just a major letdown that the film fails to be emotionally compelling. 6.5/10 (B-)",6,11,30,21 March 2010
Jarhead," well-shot, but far from being memorable
","'Jarhead' is a well-shot military drama directed by Sam Mendes far-famed for his superb cinematic debut, 'American Beauty'. Going back to the subject. With lots of funny situations and interesting, well-matched musical score 'Jarhead' provides a wonderful insight into military service. However, I felt that the director has not much to say throughout the movie. What is the biggest problem of the film is the lack of solid punchline at the end. The creators leave viewers practically with no thoughts except these ones indicating that military service involves a series of pointless actions and is dull. It definitely seems too little for a feature film and, therefore, the movie is anything but memorable. What saves 'Jarhead' from being another mediocre flick in which the form towers over substance is top-notch acting.",6,0,1,12 August 2006
Spirited Away," mind-blowing masterpiece
","In my opinion, 'Spirited Away' is certainly the best animated movie ever. The quality of animation is obviously rousing and leaves no doubts who is the greatest master of contemporary animation. Hayao Miyazaki created fantastic, surrealistic world with great reverence. Every shot from this film can be regarded as a work of art as well as every single scene takes my breath away to such an extent that I can't even point out which one made the biggest impression on me. Nevertheless, the beautiful workmanship is not only virtue of this flick as 'Spirited Away' provides also extremely coherent plot. It occurs that Miyazaki's imagination has no limits. The main heroine is entangled in a series of unexpected events having their roots probably in the mythology. The story develops through and extensively uses the main heroine. All characters are incredibly likable, which unceasingly attracts viewer's attention. 'Spirited Away' is a very universal parable which works on many levels and offers, at the same time, a unique experience. Thus, I consider this film an absolute masterpiece and I highly recommend it regardless of age and any other factors.",10,2,3,11 August 2006
District 9," perfectly conceived sci-fi cinema at its most daring and honest
","Part an elusive Apartheid allegory examining sprawling intolerance, part an enthralling transformation story, 'District 9' is perfectly conceived sci-fi cinema at its most daring and honest. It's hard to believe this is Neill Blomkamp's first feature film as he utilizes mock documentary approach in such an instantly relatable fashion that we believe in every revelation he pulls off. By showing us what happens to a derelict spacecraft stranded above South Africa, and its extraterrestrial crew forced to live in squalid camps for the last two decades, the first time filmmaker offers the social commentary that just cannot be diminished. Granted. The film is high-on-concept, intelligent and full of hidden messages like cat food being an equivalent of legalized drugs, yet it doesn't shine away from being a thrilling ride abounding with credible, cringe-worthy twists, dazzling action sequences and inventive low-key special effects. When its tone oscillates between darkly comical to deadly serious, the movie never loses its steam remaining wildly kinetic. It's also to Blomkamp's credit that 'District 9' is so emotionally resonant all the way through to its poignant finale showcasing both physical and moral transformation of the main character, social worker Wikus Van De Merwe. Newcomer Sharlto Copley provides amazingly complex performance here. Although Wikus tends to act like a complete jerk, he is surprisingly sympathetic when faced with almost unbearable circumstances. Clever and bombastic at the same time, 'District 9' is a genuine masterpiece, one of the very best sci-fi movies ever made.",10,1,9,22 March 2010
Cars," involving thanks to likable characters
","Over the decade all full-length Pixar's animated flicks kept incredibly high level and provided wise entertainment for the whole family. In addition, no other studio gained such an acceptance not only from viewers, but also from critics. Alike in case of previous Pixar's movies, I also had a big expectations with regard to 'Cars'. It turned out that 'Cars'is the least enjoyable of all Pixar's productions. The animation is as always breathtaking. The film is obviously visually stunning and a great number of scenes is beautiful. The idea of humanized talking cars was awe-inspiring and provided a room to display screenwriters' talent. However, they missed a chance to make other instant classic. The plot is rather typical and painfully predictable with an obvious message known from the very beginning. What's more, the script is not abound with wonderful ideas (I found only allusion to Road 66 interesting) and humorous situations, which was a trademark of previous Pixar's films. The emphasis is rightly placed on likable characters humanized by the excellent voice cast. Although not so great as 'Monsters, Inc' or 'The Incredibles', this flick is still worth seeing.",7,4,7,11 August 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," not only solidly crafted but also wise
","Since I haven't seen the previous two installments and am not a great buff of a X-men series, I have a lay view on the film and cannot say whether the pic works as a comic adaptation. However, I must admit that it certainly works as a movie. Existential dilemmas this film deals with are very interesting. The main theme is otherness and social reception of otherness. Can this otherness be called disease? Does society need mutants? What to do with them - 'cure' or not? These questions may provoke heated discussions after the screening. Furthermore, the film focuses more on breathtaking action sequences aided by professionally made special effects than on creating atmosphere, which seems to be a good idea as my attention was riveted throughout the flick. Brett Ratner's film is incredibly intense and fast-paced so you really shouldn't be bored. What also appeals to me is ingenuity which mainly covers the use of superpowers. The biggest shortcoming of the film is its episodic character. Director applies too many threads and most of them is underdeveloped and seems only just mentioned. Ratner should have resigned from some of them and developed thoroughly the crucial ones like Pheonix struggle for being herself. Some character's potential also regrettably remains unused. To sum up, I recommend X-Men: The Last Stand because it's a piece of solid, wise entertainment.",7,1,1,16 August 2006
Kick-Ass," a refreshingly funny and wickedly entertaining spectacle that warrants the whole franchise of masked teenagers to come
","Aptly titled Kick-Ass is an excellent comic book adaptation that proves that there is no stagnation in a superhero genre whatsoever. Based on Mark Millar's violent tale Kick-Ass is directed by Matthew Vaughn, the filmmaker who happens to have a real knack for both action movies (Layer Cake) and teen fantasies (Stardust). It's more than evident in Kick-Ass and although the film has some problems with selecting the proper tone: it verges between campy comedy, dramatic piece and action spectacle, this is a gripping ride from start to finish.Vaughn's direction is nothing less than clever and kinetic. By employing video game techniques inspired by Shoot 'Em Up and Crank movies, Vaughn really excels at showing highly-stylized bloody violence on screen. As for the script, the main concept of an ordinary teenager who chooses to become a superhero is downright effective evoking loads of laughs and our sympathy. Aaron Johnson's cool, unrestrained performance also helps a great deal.The film revitalizes the genre by undermining its rules. The characters involved have no special powers, most of them, no necessary backstory and no turning point that resulted in them becoming superheroes, much like in Watchmen. Despite this, the movie establishes its own pantheon of heroes and the director knows that there's nothing more fascinating than the battle between good and evil shown in a vivid, exciting fashion.What's controversial about the film is the extensive use of pitch-black humor including the character of 11-year-old Mindy McReady aka Hit-Girl who has been trained from the early years to become a killing machine by her loving father aka Big Daddy. The whole subplot may be immoral for some who don't understand this kind of cinema, yet it's surprisingly plausible due to a tongue-in-cheek writing and acting talents of Chloe Moretz and Nicolas Cage who are as subversive in their respective parts as you can get. Last but not least, the artist formerly known as McLovin' channels a wannabe villain named Red Mist. You may be actually surprised by how smart he is in his plotting.Overall, Kick-Ass is a refreshingly funny and wickedly entertaining spectacle that warrants the whole franchise of masked teenagers to come. 9/10 (A-)",9,8,23,25 April 2010
The Hurt Locker," a suspenseful war movie riddled with sadness and desperation
","The Hurt Locker is something of a rarity, feature war movie set in Iraq that actually works, even though it doesn't tell anything new. Director Kathryn Beigelow (Strange Days) conters on a highly trained bomb disposal team amidst violent conflict. Scriptwriter Mark Boal was a member of such a team and although the story is said to be entirely fictional, one can't stop wondering if there are any autobiographical elements. Boal's script is unpredictable and challenging offering many unexpected twists and turns. It doesn't try to tell the story, but presents us only with daily routines of the squad entirely doomed with tragic unpredictability. I've always considered Bigelow as a splendid director. In The Hurt Locker her direction is flawlessly detached when she examines the conflicts between the soldiers and effectively polished when she deals with suspense-ridden sequences. The acting is another highlight. Jeremy Renner as indifferent to death, yet vulnerable Staff Sergeant James gives a complex performance, perhaps the best in his career. Anthony Mackie and Brian Garaghty are totally believable as well. The movie quite effectively shows how the relations between these three soldiers change in the course of time. To conclude, The Hurt Locker is a suspenseful war movie riddled with sadness and desperation. It deserves to be seen.",8,2,9,25 March 2010
Green Street Hooligans," a profound insight into the hobby of sport-obsessed England
","'Green Street Hooligans' fortunately isn't a worse version of 'Football Factory'. Even though the subject of films is the same (football hooliganism), both movies visibly differ. In contrast to 'Football Factory', 'Hooligans' doesn't have a humorous bent and has a clear-cut message. Namely, the violence addiction is destructive and does not leave anybody unharmed. The film says that violence is indispensable part of every man's life and every man is, like the main character played by Elijah Wood, susceptible to it if only he has an opportunity. Matts falls deeper and deeper into the firm under Pete's influence. On the other side, the movie has a good pacing and fight scenes shot with a feeling. The acting is exceptionally good. In particular, Charlie Hunnam as an ambiguous Pete Dunham did a good job. His balance acting oscillates between practically two different characters (brutal vs caring). Major vices of this film are its predictability and that some threads are far-fetched, but still it remains a profound insight into the hobby of sport-obsessed England.",8,0,1,12 August 2006
The World's Fastest Indian," has a charm and wonderful message
","The World's Fastest Indian is a slice-of-life biopic with elements of road movie about Burt Munro, a New Zealander who travels to Utah in order to break a speed record on his motorcycle called Indian. I usually disapprove of predictable biopics of which the main purpose is to glorify the main character. However, The World's Fastest Indian achieves a level of which other biopics' creators can only dream (I'm thinking about Ron Howard among others right now). Namely, this movie has a charm and wonderful message that age really doesn't matter when you have a passion for anything you adore. Burt Munro is depicted as a saintly, spotless old man who delights every person he meets with grace. In this respect the film resembles Lynch's The Straight Story. I would lie if I wrote that naivety of Donaldson's movie didn't annoy me at times, but through most of the flick I support Munro in his road to success. The credit for this goes to Sir Anthony Hopkins whose amazing performance in this flick is one of the best in his career and in 2005. The cinematography and dessert scenery are delightful. In addition, thanks to good-natured tone the film has a bit fairylike character and funny moments, which I enjoyed. All in all, not only motorcycle fans will adore this picture. Thumbs up.",8,0,0,11 August 2006
Avatar," reclaims James Cameron as the most visionary director of our generation
","Nearly two decades in the making, $300 millions spend and apt promises it will revolutionize cinema as we know it, Avatar reclaims James Cameron as the most visionary director of our generation. The movie can be described as an amazing 3D experience that uses the sci-fi plot as a platform to present its unique style. Avatar is just that spectacular blending Cameron's inherent ease in telling the story with the use of new astonishing technology on full display. The pro-environmental message of the movie may not be original (among others it was superbly explored in Hayao Miyazaki's epic, Castle In The Sky), yet it doesn't even matter since the movie is so powerfully conducted and ingeniously conceived. Cameron has created the new civilization that is equally potent and galvanizing. With their distinct characteristics and language, Navis feel totally authentic. The computer generated backgrounds are just pleasure to behold with the high level of detail and highly exotic feel. Avatar also wouldn't be the same movie without its tour-de-force action sequences that raise the bar ridiculously high. Nonetheless, I still felt emotionally involved due to a surprisingly moving performance by Zoe Saldana. This kind of emotions cannot be generated with computer. She even overshadows Sam Worthington who happens to be very reliable in the leading role. Overall, Avatar is one hell of a ride worth taking again and again. It has never been more apparent than now that Cameron is the king of the world. 10/10 (A)",10,5,9,21 March 2010
Drag Me to Hell," campy, gruesome, frenetic and most of all supremely entertaining
","'Drag Me To Hell' finds director Sam Raimi coming back to his own roots. The movie is reminiscent of his cult Evil Dead series. Although it is not as amazing as 'Evil Dead II', it still delivers a well-balanced combination of horror and comedy Raimi is famous for. After her unwillingness to help an old gypsy woman, Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) experiences the unusual attack from the angry witch casting a spell on her. The movie oscillates between a supernatural horror and a farce making for an inventive, yet totally amusing thrill ride. Even though the ending happens to be predictable, 'Drag Me To Hell' never fails to capture attention with its tour de force scenes depicting violent attacks of evil forces. The movie is campy, gruesome, frenetic and most of all supremely entertaining.",8,0,1,25 March 2010
Up," unforgettable movie, equally laugh-out-loud funny and wistfully nostalgic
","Pixar are continuing their winning streak with this uplifting (yeah!) masterwork. 'Up' takes an unusual, awkward premise and turns it into an unforgettable movie, equally laugh-out-loud funny and wistfully nostalgic. Let's start from the beginning. The first 10-minute montage depicting elderly Carl Friedrikson's life is mesmerizing to the point that it ranks among the most poignant ones ever created. What's following is more adventure/comedy-oriented material with its blend of electrifying action sequences resembling 'The Incredibes'. Up's own identity is unquestionable though. In a nutshell, the movie is about putting the past in perspective, about gaining the distance to the past events and eventually accepting them. All three central characters deal with a painful loss of some kind. Carl mourns her late wife Ellie, young Russell misses his now distant father and ex-celebrity adventurer turned villain Charles Muntz has lost his credibility chasing supposedly imaginary bird. It's not the climax that matters here that much, but the journey towards this finality. On their journey, Carl and Russell meet a wonderfully goofy bird named Kevin and a sweet talking dog called Dug. Their adventures, albeit exciting, require certain risks and sacrifices. 'Up' blends fantastic with realistic: it's the first Pixar film where blood is visibly shed and death is dealt with so prominently. All these adult themes may seem too much for a kid-friendly movie, but directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson do such a wonderful job of keeping all the aspects of the story balanced and characters easily reliable. 'Up' is a fully accomplished exercise in escapism that soars every time it should fall. Superbly executed and enthralling in its ideas, it raises the bar so immensely high.",10,0,1,22 March 2010
Crazy Heart," an average movie that benefits from an Oscar-caliber turn by Bridges
","Scott Cooper's debut feature film Crazy Heart tells a redemption story about aging booze-addicted country musician Bad Blake (Jeff Bridges) who suddenly falls in love with a much younger woman. Regrettably, the movie isn't even remotely on par with Jeff Bridges' authentic portrayal which truly deserves Oscar-consideration. Aside from it, only the country songs composed by T-Bone Burnett are up to scratch. I admit it although I'm not really keen on country music. Other than that, Crazy Heart suffers from utterly conventional script most of all. One can usually predict the major plot points before they take place, which seldom makes for gripping cinema. Scott Cooper, who also wrote the script, doesn't provide enough material to make a truly demanding film resembling last year's The Wrestler. Instead, Crazy Heart happens to be too light for its own good. We nearly don't care though because Bridges' performance is so captivating and truthful. Other actors fail to a degree because the writing is so unremarkable. Maggie Gyllenhaal just doesn't have enough material to play a juicy dramatic role and her relationship with Bridges seems to be rushed. Although the subplot with Colin Farrell starring as a country star influenced by Bad is quite interesting, the movie just doesn't let it develop properly. Overall, Crazy Heart is an average movie that benefits from an Oscar-caliber turn by Bridges so much that it gets a mild recommendation from me. 6/10 (B-)",6,0,2,21 March 2010
Lord of War," lengthy satire with dry first-person narration
","Gun plays essential role in many movies produced nowadays. However, there's still not enough films which depict gun industry and the involvement of governments in gun trade (apart from Bowling For Columbine I haven't seen any). Lord of War is one of those sparse, enlightening movies. Although the idea of the flick was ultra-original and interesting, the film itself disappoints. I cannot deny this film bravery in attitude towards the subject which has been presented thoroughly. Nevertheless, Lord of War is mercilessly wordy as well as pompous and that makes it almost unbearable. Instead of suspenseful thriller, Andrew Niccol shot a lengthy satire with dry first-person narration. His sense of mission is excessively visible here and, as a result, the message is overstated.",4,1,5,11 August 2006
Mary and Max," lovely oddball and admirably complex
","Coming from Australia, Mary and Max is one of these few films you'll remember all your life. This amazing claymation touches upon an unlikely friendship between two pen pals: a young girl living in Australia and an aging Jew from New York. It's unbelievable what a precisely structured narrative this is. Director-writer Adam Elliot blends odd scatological, yet clever humour with poignant dramatizations to a splendid effect creating one of the best tragicomedies of the past few years. The fact that it's in the form of claymation only helps to enhance uniqueness of the whole experience. The movie was 5 years in the making and this is visible in its every frame. Elliot masterly captures the motion in an endlessly creative manner. Most importantly though, his lovably oddball characters are well developed and admirably complex with all their awkward traits and quirks. Due to its serious themes and dark tone, Mary and Max is an adult movie aiming much higher than its big studio counterparts. It happens to be more contemplative, and intelligent mimicking the real life with all its ups and downs. Calling Elliot's movie an extraordinary piece of art is certainly not an overstatement.",10,81,96,22 March 2010
Fantastic Mr. Fox," a great story abounding with odd comedic touches and a spark of melodrama thrown inbetween
","Don't even try to deny that 2009 was the year of animation. This is another great animated movie that happens to invigorate its director's career. Based on Roald Dahl's classic, Fantastic Mr. Fox infiltrates Wes Anderson's trademark quirky blend of humor into a gripping narrative. While the material might be too snarky and sophisticated for children, adults should enjoy Anderson's refreshing approach. The movie's look is pleasantly off-beat, yet imaginative with superbly designed characters and sweet ingenious action pieces. The truly extraordinary world created on screen is incredibly detailed and resonates with Anderson's style very well. Apart from being a sheer delight to watch, Fantastic Mr. Fox stands as a great story abounding with odd comedic touches and a spark of melodrama thrown inbetween. It's definitely a good combination in a movie that is so unique that just needs to be seen once again.",8,0,1,25 March 2010
Evil Dead II," one of the best and most entertaining horror movies in history
","Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn is a cult classic horror-comedy about which you just cannot forget while picking up your favorite horror movies. Director Sam Raimi evidently is in luck to sequels because Spiderman 2 is also superior to the 1st part. What is the biggest virtue of Evil Dead 2 is undoubtedly its originality in attitude towards seemingly worn out story. Evil finds its way to real world thanks to mysterious book called Necronomicon. Brave Ash (great Bruce Campbell) whose girl has changed into zombie is forced to fight and overcome evil powers. Raimi has really no interest in developing some kind of complicated story here, his film is just a wonderful, daring exercise in horror combined with comedy. It seems that director's inventiveness has no limits and viewers has no option but to cheer and laugh their head out while Ash's attempts to oppose evil. Ash with his chainsaw and sewn rifle is undoubtedly an icon of horror movies. His nonchalant behavior mixed with shrewdness works superbly no matter what bizarre challenges he has to face. The flick contains a wide range of ingenious special effects and first-grade gore scenes in no way disrupting the simple, but convincing plot. Besides, the camera work is often unconventional and many intriguing tricks occur. To sum up, Evil Dead 2 is one of the best and most entertaining horror films in history. Highly recommended if you haven't seen it yet.",10,1,3,23 September 2006
Up in the Air," smarter than your average dramedy
","While it doesn't achieve the status of masterpiece, this is another very solid dramedy from Jason Reitman, a gifted filmmaker who proves not to be overshadowed by his father's persona any more. Up In The Air is far from being hysterically funny, yet its clever script happens to be timely due to the economical crisis. Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is one of the top employees of the agency that dismisses people. Thus, he is always on the run flying to different parts of the US. During the course of time he meets two women who are about to change his viewpoint on becoming involved in the romantic relationship. The story is fluidly told and never ceases to be gripping. Reitman superbly balances the two subplots concerning dismissing people and Ryan's affair building to the climax that involves a surprising, well-calculated twist. George Clooney is graceful, if slightly underwhelming delivering some over-intelectualized lines even through voice-over. Once he gets criticized for it by his new co-worker Natalie Keener played by splendid Anna Kendrick. Both she and Vera Farmiga as Clooney's love interest are both amazing displaying unique characters with totally distinct features. Although Reitman's direction is always compelling, he still overuses sloppy indie music I dislike so much. Overall, Up In The Air lacks the edge and controversy to be classic in my view. It's still way smarter than your average dramedy.",8,1,2,25 March 2010
V for Vendetta," remember remember the 5th of November
","'V for Vendetta' had a great initial material in the form of a great Alan Moore's comic book. To my mind, the flick didn't waste it and, what's more, retained a climate of a comic but not exactly its letter. Wachowscy did a great job transforming a comic book into a movie. Most of the decisions they made seems appropriate to me. The acting also is sensational. The film provides wise entertainment and is emotionally powerful thanks to Natalie Portman. Furthermore, the movie somehow relates to the contemporary political situation and, what is the most important, persuades into thinking. In particular, two scenes are amazing. First one is the TV show a la Benny Hill and the second one is the final scene in which a motif of everyman is used. Highly recommended.",9,0,1,12 August 2006
