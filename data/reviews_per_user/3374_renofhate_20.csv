Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The Bride closing in on the Dead Viper Assassination Squad's Remaining Members
","Kill Bill Vol. 2 is Tarantino at his best! The Bride returns to finish where she left off.. I might be one of those few people who prefers part two to part one. Don't get me wrong, they're both equal for me as is, but I do think I'd choose part two if I had to. Kill Bill Vol. 2 is a lot like the first instalment but also a whole lot different. Tarantino delivers once again with an amazing action/martial arts/crime/thriller extravaganza. I love how these films pay homage to spaghetti westerns and grindhouse. The little elements that add to this film make it all the more better. While Kill Bill Vol. 1 is a bloody showdown, the second Kill Bill instalment feels like a continuation in the form of story more so than anything. The scenes that depict The Bride while doing her training are some of my favourite scenes of the entire Kill Bill double-act. The villain, main antagonist Bill, is actually here in this one. As you could guess. There are some over-the-top scenes of epic sword brutality though, don't think otherwise. The music is a particular highlight for the movie as well, and co-stars Daryl Hannah, Michael Madsen, and David Carradine all give great performances. The choreography is good and the cinematography and set locations and scenery are all good as well. The dialogue is brilliant through and through. I love the character development in this film as well because you find out more about The Bride herself, and more of a backstory is prominent in this one. The fact that this one depicts more scenes from the past is interesting and one of my favourite things about the film. There are some unexpected twists that I really enjoy as well in Vol. 2. I love the scenes with Bill and The Bride as well, and I thought the film's opening act was a good choice given it starts with The Bride and Bill and looks back to when The Bride was gunned down adding to the story before the film is even properly started. Bill's death scene is so well done, especially given it's the shortest fight between The Bridge and anyone. A quick but effective death, full of impact, and the acting from Thurman in particular during the scene is outstanding. It's highly enjoyable from start to finish, I love it, and I can't recommend it enough. Tarantino does it again!",10,0,1,26 January 2020
It," Don't cha want it? Don't Cha Want It? DON'TCHA WANT IT? No, I do not.
","Alright, so I put this off for quite some time. After watching the original 1990 It, which is absolutely fantastic and actually quite eerie, creepy, and dare I say... SCARY, this film is pretty much heavily relied on CGI, jump scares, comedy and over-abundant profanity. There is nothing chilling or intense or terrifying here, and while there isn't anything TOO terrifying or beyond shocking in the 90s one, at least its elements of horror are very much more prominent and are executed so much better. This isn't bad by any means, but 'It' is far from good. I won't even bother with the Part II. I just don't think it's evoking or interesting or even HORROR enough to want to continue and watch more. If they're deluded into believing this 2017 It film is frightening and has some shock factor, they're wrong. There's a few good scenes, maybe one or two that are somewhat creepy and intriguing, but 80% of it is just blatantly nonredeemable in quality replay factor and value. Oh well, I'll stick with the original and the book.",5,0,1,17 November 2019
Superbad," As close to a meaningful AND funny comedy as you're gonna get!
","People really enjoy a well-executed comedy movie; one that has a lot of jokes throughout while keeping you compelled all the same. Superbad does just that. The hilarity of it all is, ironically enough, the outcome and most meaningful factor of the movie itself. Although they're two friends who are trying their best to lose their virginity (well, arguably one of them is more in to the idea than the other), the recurring theme here is friendship. It's done so well and the jokes throughout are balanced coherently and are done right. It doesn't overstay its welcome in any scene, the comedy is there, at all times, but it's never tiresome. The camaraderie is wonderful. The cast themselves do a terrific job at keeping you engaged and laughing. And its support cast do a fantastic job as well - looking at you, Bill Hader and Seth Rogen. If you're a fan of comedies and you have yet to watch Superbad, I highly recommend it. Four times I have seen it now, and it still makes me laugh more than most comedies do. What Superbad has established and solidified here is you don't need over-the-top jokes, toilet humour and stuff, et al, to be funny. Balanced out, fresh comedies like this are the real deal, with this one being a prominent figure in that said topic of film. I laugh when watching it but its closure is somewhat heartfelt and it truly captures the essence of friendship. A funny and meaningful movie and definitely one of the best comedy movies of the past decade for sure. 9/10.",10,1,1,2 July 2019
Creed," It's Good as Its Own Film - But Makes a Fine Addition to the Rocky Legacy
","Creed was the film I was sceptical of for such a long time. I could have watched it thirty times over in the amount of time I spent building up to watch it. Then, I finally did. I thought at first it was going okay. I knew this wasn't going to be my favourite Rocky (related) film, but there was every chance it could be second or third. Course, there was every chance it could have been my least favourite and I ended up giving it a 5/10, but that didn't happen. Halfway through the film, say around the second Act, I remember slouching just a little. I liked what I was seeing but some things were missing. First of all, I still find it hard to watch Rocky on-screen as an old man. I'm just so used to and have always been used to watching the first five, when he was much younger, you know. Obviously there's a five year filmmaking jump between IV and V, but still. The end of the film approached and the credits appeared themselves. What I had just watched wasn't my favourite Rocky movie, but could have been the best-made/most well-made of the Rocky films. And if you're like me you'd say the other was the very first Rocky. The cinematography and fight choreography are fantastic and so is the directing and acting. Stallone does give a fantastic performance, co-star or not. It doesn't feel out of place that Stallone is the second main star of the film, cuz A: Jordan gives a great performance himself and B: even being cast as the movie's co-star, Rocky is in almost every part of the film. Like he isn't seen until around 10-15 minutes in, but still, he's there all the time and it's brilliant. The film's antagonist is decent enough, albeit nowhere near as memorable as the likes of, say, Ivan Drago or Clubber Lang. Or even Apollo Creed. They're just the greatest, you know. Although the two awesome things here are 1) It's so cool knowing it's actually the son of Apollo Creed who's the star, and 2) Well, the antagonist of the second film is Ivan Drago's son, and apparently Drago is in it himself.Some things irk me a lot. Why does Rocky gotta have cancer in the film? It makes me sad cuz I don't want anything to happen to him in the next film. He's one of the best movie characters of all time. And I don't like the fact that Creed loses. They made Rocky lose in the first Rocky, and in Rocky Balboa. I know he lost in Rocky III too but he later won. Why make Creed also lose? He should win in the first two and if they make a third one, let him go out as one who's been defeated but make it a great match. Solid movie either way. 9.5/10edit-07/03/2018: After watching it another time, it's definitely obtaining the 10/10 score, particularly thanks to its cinematography, fight choreography, dialogue, acting and direction. The more I see it, the more I like it, it seems. I also strongly believe this film showcases Michael B. Jordan's best performance. His return is definitely long-awaited. 10/10.",10,1,2,29 June 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Simply epic
","Well for what it's worth, Thor Ragnarok is definitely a satisfying and suitable ending when speaking of this year's MCU movies. Despite enjoying Spider-Man Homecoming a little more overall, partially because there were things I didn't like about Thor Ragnarok but there was very little I disliked about Homecoming, all in all, this film is really, really good. It's explosive and fun and colorful and enjoyable and looks terrific and exquisite all throughout. Is it overdone? You decide whether or not they overdid some things for this one. I see lots of people comparing it to Guardians of the Galaxy and while I don't fully agree, I can definitely say that there are some things that are reminiscent of the Guardians' movies, but certainly not in a bad way.What makes this film so good is its associates. They're not out of place and they're not really forced in; like, it fits perfectly, man. Everything comes together so nicely. Take Hulk for example. I was thinking, 'Hulk may or may not work in this film. Could be great, could be straight out opposite.' Well, overall, I think it's a good idea that they did include Hulk - even more so when they had him appear as Bruce, rather than Hulk himself. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk is by far the best one yet. Well, to me at least. Another thing I have to include is its humor. Some say it's either a little forced or it's just simply not all that funny. Well, the moments that were funny, were funny. Not much more can be said other than the fact that yeah, some stuff had me like, 'Ehh.. okay', but for the most part, there's some solid laughs here and there.Jeff Goldblum's role was unique, to say the least - but did kind of remind me of The Collector from Guardians of the Galaxy. I don't know, he just did. Not a bad thing, but you know. If I were to comment on his character, I would have to say he's pretty good. He's not amazing, but he's an interesting part of the film and makes an okay villain (assuming you would call him that). One thing that really stood out to me and made the film even more enjoyable was its brother scenes, aka, scenes that revolve around Loki and Thor together. That was good in this film. I actually enjoyed Loki in this more than I did The Avengers. And Hemsworth is superb in the film. Not a better guy out there that could have played Thor. He was the correct, undeniable greatest choice.There's also a very good 'cameo' like role, if you will, which does add to the movie. The film also doesn't lose its identity, meaning that even though there are other characters and whatnot, it's first and foremost a Thor film.Here's what I didn't like (or, who I didn't like, for that matter): Hela. My reasons for disliking her character are pretty much simplistic and generic, but they're not invalid by any means- she's annoying. She's boring. That's really all I can say. I mean, there's a scene in which I do love that includes her, but it's spoiler-ish, so maybe another time...Overall, however, a great film. Bright, colorful, funny, loads of action, good character usage, and the third act is damn good! I think this is perhaps my sixth favorite MCU film overall, overtaking Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, but it is still right behind: 5- Spider-Man Homecoming, 4-The Avengers, 3-Captain America The Winter Soldier, 2-Guardians of the Galaxy and 1-Captain America Civil War. Ragnarok is a terrific film though, and it's one of this year's best.8.5/10",10,101,193,29 October 2017
Predator," Kill Me! Do it now! Kill me, I'm here! Kill me! Come on, do it now, kill me!
","Ah, 1987's sci-fi action, Predator, which stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Shane Black, Jesse Ventura and several others as a team of soldiers who one by one become the prey of an alien hunter. Solid from start to finish with some fine performances, a ton of blood and guts, action galore and its theme score really adds to the overall brutal, jungle atmosphere of the movie. It's great because not only is this one of my favourite Arnold Schwarzenegger films (if not my favourite), but it's one of my favourite films of all time.The film sees the elite paramilitary explore somewhere in Central America, they're assigned by the CIA to rescue hostages who are held by guerillas. Little does the team know that someone is watching over them, camouflaged. As the film progresses, it sees the extra-terrestrial warrior kill them off one by one. The first kill is Hawkins, whose death scene comes quick and unexpectedly. Toward the end of the film, there's only one male character remaining, as Anna, a woman who's taken in by the team, ran off to find the 'Chopper', as Dutch (Schwarzenegger) says earlier. It comes down to Dutch vs the alien warrior. Dutch realises that despite its advanced capabilities, the warrior can't see through mud, even with its powerful heat vision. It uses Infrared to see and wears a mask, has a shoulder cannon, a sphere and a double blade attached to its wrist (I'll delve more into the Predator weapon terminology some other time). Dutch, to his advantage whilst covered in mud, sets up traps to slowly but surely defeat or even wound the creature. After a series of wins by Dutch, a major downfall occurs after Dutch lands in a lake which then clears his mud. Before he's able to get up, the hunter captures him. A few seconds pass before it detaches some of its now-obsolete and unusable weaponry and unmasks. This is where the tables completely turn, and the Predator gets the upper-hand, beating Dutch viciously in a man-to-man like fist fight. Just before it seems as if Dutch hasn't got anything left, having crawled into a small space which has a trap with it, he taunts the warrior to come and kill him, knowing if he does he'll die at the hands of his trap. The Predator, unbeknownst to his trap and plan at first, catches on and decides to go the other way. Just when you think Dutch has been outsmarted, he quickly enables another trap which knocks the Predator down. After Dutch gets a good up-close look at the warrior in its most wounded form thus far, asking the creature what it is, he realises that the Predator has enabled a detonation, self-destruction bomb which ultimately kills him, almost catching Dutch in the process. He merely escapes, bloodily and broken.With some of the best score from any movie I've seen, with truly-brilliant delivered performances, laughs, an abundance of action and gore, an amazing antagonist, a strong plot, and with a satisfying ending, plus so much more, it's no wonder as to why this is an all-time favourite. It's amazing all-round. And to this day, it remains the best of the entire series. I love it.10/10.",10,0,0,9 August 2018
Justice League," Mind-blowing? No. Jaw-dropping? No. Mindless entertainment and fun? Sure. Here's Justice League.
","Well if it isn't Zack Snyder once again, people; a director I've had a love-hate relationship with for many years now. Let's get this out of the way: the guy doesn't really know a whole lot about comic books and representation/portrayal, but you can't say the guy doesn't know a thing. He does, albeit not an abundance of. Oh, and let me get one more thing out of the way: I DESPISE the way Wonder Woman says, 'Kal-El, no.' before they face off against Superman. I don't know, it just annoys me so much. But let's talk about the movie itself. How is Justice League? On a scale of 0-100, it's about a 65. Or 6.5/10. Sure, you could arguably round it up to 7, but I'm keeping it at 6. The visual effects, at times, are absolutely fine, then they're god-awful and the film looks cheap, messy, and can come across as both lazy and lousy. The performances aren't incredible but they're pretty good. I kinda like Ben Affleck as Batman, but then I remember I prefer Keaton, Conroy, Bale, etc. Hey, at least he's more entertaining than George Clooney and Val Kilmer when it comes to portraying the character, at least in my opinion. Gal Gadot is okay, but she was so much better in her own film. I'd say she's about the same here as she was in Batman v Superman - so just okay/decent. Jason Mamoa is pretty good as Aquaman, I won't lie. Almost the standout character for me, thus I definitely gotta check out his solo movie. Ezra Miller is pretty good as the Flash I'd say. Some of his lines that are meant to be funny aren't all that funny though. The humour can feel a little forced in general though, or just plain unfunny. And of course Henry Cavil as Superman, for the third (and final?) time was pretty good, but mainly that's because of the battle between him in the others was, for the most part, cool to see. But he overpowers them all and, while he is the most powerful of them for sure, I can't help but wonder what would have happened had they got some attacks in. Superman is meant to be this powerful but I kinda feel that sometimes we see him in an overpowering state with Cavil as if he actually could be somewhat more powerful and a little antagonistic (cheers Zack and the gang), but it's cool. And Steppenwolf and his Parademons seemed a pretty good threat until Supes came in, who basically destroyed Steppenwolf without even trying. The villain was cool, but not enough for me to believe he was a massive threat after Superman basically killed him with a punch, you know, despite being made out to be such a monster and the world was on brink of chaotic collapse. Overall, Justice League is a pretty decent film, there are lots of flaws but it makes up for some of them at times thanks to action, some heartfelt moments, and of course the team itself - the Justice League.
Standouts: Aquaman, Superman, Superman vs Justice League, (and for the most part, not entirely, but most) the final battle.

American Psycho," 'Do you like Huey Lewis and The News?'
","'...their early work was a little too... new wave, for my tastes.. but when sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own - commercially and artistically.' American Psycho is one of the most quotable movies ever made. It's a dark comedy / crime / drama from the year 2000, and of course its main star is Christian Bale. Bale stars as Patrick Bateman, a wealthy investment bank executive from New York who has a bit of an ego. It appears, that Bateman is a psychopath and a serial killer, who has all these sick, twisted fantasies and own gruesome ways.As the film progresses, you're able to see his mind collapse and turn on him, as he goes from killing in control, to being uncontrollable. It's a pretty dark shift, but a very interesting one -- because the movie is, simply put, fantastic. I would have to say, as early as this, that the movie is one of the very best in cinematic history. It's my personal favorite of all time. It's incredible, and Christian Bale is a magnificent actor. He was absolutely brilliant in his role as Bruce Wayne / Batman, among many others... but this was, by far, the performance of his life. Nobody could have portrayed Patrick Bateman other than Bale himself, so it was a perfect casting choice for sure.The movie is dark, funny, violent, and at times can be confusing, but not in a bad way by any means. I would say that American Psycho is one of those movies that, although very, very good, doesn't quite have the total recognition that it so rightfully and so truly deserves. It's got a big large following of fans, though.It's a must-see film and I can't describe it as meaningfully as I would like to. I believe this is just simply, one of those, 'see for yourself, man!' movies. It's a once in a lifetime movie, perhaps. It's that damn good! There are so many reasons as to why it's my all time favorite film. It's the perfect film for sure.Also, its ending? Here's where you may go wrong. You may come off thinking, 'So, it was all in his own head? He was just, like, imagining the whole scenario and stuff?' Nope. Literally all of it happened (maybe excluding the bank statement thing with the cat.) You see, I can say (since it's spoiler-ticked review), that it all happens because: if you watch the movie, you'll see what these people are like. They're corrupted. They're greedy. They're selfish. They only want what's best for them, nothing more, nothing less. They barely know each other's real names, and don't care enough to find out what's true, what's proper. You know how like, Paul Allen thinks Bateman's name is Marcus Halberstram? That's an example. They don't care to find out what's right from wrong, truth from lies. So when the guy at the end of the film says, to Bateman: 'because I had dinner with Paul Allen, in London, (however many) days ago...' what if the guy had dinner with who he thought, was Paul Allen? That's what I mean. Patrick would then continue to slip through and escape any cracks which would enclose him, and keep him with life in prison, or the death penalty.Truly, American Psycho is a remarkable movie. I must-see with so many fantastic moments.10 / 10 5 / 5",10,2,4,17 September 2016
Wanted," A Wicked and Unique Insight into Full-Assassin Mode!
","Man this movie rocks! I've seen this film so many times these past six or seven years, it never gets tiresome! I think I have seen it maybe twenty to thirty times by now, and I love it just as much as I did when I first saw it in 2012. Its visual effects are really good and they're not overdone. The acting is fantastic and I believe this is one of James McAvoy's best roles to date. He's very convincing in the film and portrays lead role of Wesley Gibson, a struggling, anxious office worker whose boss humiliates him big-time, as his co-worker and friend has sex with his girlfriend behind his back -- to which Wesley is aware of, yet shows no desire of stopping it or doing something about it. He just lets people walk all over him. That is, until, he meets 'Fox' - played by the talented Angelina Jolie, and a team of assassins known as 'The Fraternity.' The Fraternity is lead by the wise, hypnotising Morgan Freeman, whose acting is also fantastic here, and in general. There are huge plot twists, and unbeknownst to Wesley, the true antagonist all along was Sloan (Morgan Freeman), as we find that the man who believe to be the villain and antagonist all along, 'Cross' (who we believe has killed Wesley's father at the start of the movie) is actually Wesley's father, and all along he was trying to protect him. Their reason for training Wesley into becoming a masterful assassin and pitting him against Cross? He was the one person Cross would not kill. Superb cinematography and choreography, intelligent techniques (the bullet-bending technique is both shocking and absurd all the same, yet very unique and cool), solid performances, direction and a lot of profanity, violence/action, and sadness all throughout. There are heartfelt moments, mind-bending, jaw dropping action sequences, unpredictability and a lot of strong dialogue as well. Timur Bekmambetov outdid himself here as a director, I feel. It's a well-balanced yet prominently-dark action thriller with thrills, twists, chaos and madness to keep you at the edge of your seat wanting more. A sequel is in no way far-fetched and to this day I'd love to see one. 9/10",9,1,2,8 July 2019
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," This film is hilarious
","This movie is damn funny. Every 10-15 minutes there is something hilarious happening, the unfortunate Andy makes this absolutely ingenious. Tons of comedy, romance, and the story of a lonely virgin in his forties who's into your everyday geek culture. The amount of times I laughed uncontrollably, the first time I saw this, was insane. Must've been 20/30 time's at least, I think I was 16. Now having seen it a good four or five times, I can say this is a top 10 favourite comedy for me. Steve Carell, Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen and more.. Alongside Superbad and Role Models, this very well might be in my top three. The consistency in its comedy throughout, especially the scenes like the poker scene, wax scene, sex talk scene, car scene, bath scene.. so many great, and ridiculously funny moments. I applaud the writer and the actors, this is a solid comedy you should definitely see! I give it a 9.5-10/10
I wish it was a little longer because I could have watched this film for three hours honestly, it's both as interesting as it is funny... Amazing",10,0,0,4 March 2020
Avengers: Endgame," MCU's landmark: Avengers Endgame- Action packed, surpasses expectations and emotionally delivers
","If you're a fan of the MCU obviously you have seen their 22-story entry landmark that is this year's AVENGERS: ENDGAME -- the biggest MCU movie yet, in all of its eleven years of movies. ENDGAME absolutely delivers and pushes so many boundaries and limits. If you set your expectations high you'll still likely be shocked more so than you thought you'd be because of how epic it is. You'd think maybe, just maybe, after three hours you'd get bored but it manages to capture and hold the viewer and provides tons of laughs, action and heartfelt, emotionally-punching scenes throughout its entirety. Act II is great and Act III is by far the best Act of any MCU film to date. The original six Avengers' actors deserve the most praise by all means, and Paul Rudd gives his best and peak performance yet as Scott Lang / Ant-Man. There are so many breathtaking and solid scenes throughout and the movie showcases an abundance of characters, particularly in its closing. You'll see, if by chance you haven't seen it yet.It's as close to a masterpiece as you're gonna get.",10,5,6,19 July 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR -- Thanos Is Coming!
","Major spoilers ahead.Finally, after years of waiting, Infinity War has finally dropped and is gathering more attention than every other movie combined. This is nothing new to the MCU, as their movies typically take over when they arrive; not that this is a bad thing, but it's true.With Infinity War, Earth's mightiest heroes Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and The Hulk, alongside Black Widow, Vision, Scarlet Witch, Black Panther, Spider-Man, the Guardians of the Galaxy (you can see there's an abundance of characters), etc, find themselves on the brink of total wipeout as the powerful mad titan, Thanos, arrives on earth to collect the remaining infinity stone(s) and achieve what he believes will be world peace. This is far from true because in actuality, he could very well destroy half of the Universe. Thanos uses the powerful infinity gauntlet which obtains all of the infinity stones. With this, Thanos is almost immortal, and wields powers that are limitless...It is up to the Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and their allies to try and stop Thanos and help save humanity before it's too late, as it can very well be destroyed with the snap of his fingers. Let me tell you this, after ten years of MCU, this is definitely a fitting forefront and makes for a massive achievement. The thing that astounds me is that this is the first of what would originally be two parts, and I honestly cannot see how they will top this, (and although it was announced it would serve as its own film, I still see it as a part II to an extent, although it will be the fourth Avengers movie overall, of course).The big question, which is of course one of many, is... Do the Avengers stop Thanos? Simply put, no they do not. They do not succeed in stopping him, and many of them perish at the very hands of him. Who are some of the heroes we see die? Well, there's a plethora of dead heroes now, and some of them include Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, Vision, Black Panther, Star-Lord, Gamora, and Loki, among others. Obviously they're not all dead, the likes of Spider-Man, Black Panther, Doctor Strange and some of, if not all the Guardians will come back in the next film - whether it be reversed time or the quantum realm. Or, you know, some other, unpredictable way which throws us off guard like many of the deaths during this film did.The film is fantastic from start to finish, doesn't lose its serious and heartfelt moments to humor (and the humor is balanced out and structured well), has an array of lovable characters and is stuffed and packed full of action, with tremendous visual effects that are at the top of their game. It's funny, thrilling, brutal and bold, all in one. Some characters I feel, of course, stand out more than others, but they're all good. A few of my favorites include Thor, Iron Man, Spidey, Captain America, The Winter Soldier, Black Panther, Star-Lord, Doctor Strange, and of course, Thanos himself - who at times I must admit, I was rooting for, despite rooting for the Avengers overall as a collective whole. There are moments where you feel bad for Thanos (or maybe not, to each their own and so on, so forth lol). I did. But of course, it gets more emotional and heartfelt and mind-boggling as the film progresses. It is truly epic, each and every scene and act.This is definitely going to surpass many a film and I seriously believe that it is the biggest film of all time - even if it doesn't surpass the box office record for the highest-grossing movie of all time, I believe it is the most well-known film because of its status, the fact that it's already breaking records, and it's total, cumulative views regarding its trailers and teasers. And of course, it's Marvel, man, which really speaks for itself...Just go and see it and have fun!But not too much fun, because fun isn't something one considers when balancing the universe, even if it puts a smile on your face..EDIT: 06/07/2019 -- I must admit, despite the fact I enjoy ENDGAME a little more overall, I feel INFINITY WAR will age better of the two of them for some reason. I feel in regards to actual narrative and storytelling, INFINITY WAR gets the upper hand. This movie offers an abundance of fight sequences and action that will take your breath away, and to this day I cannot stop watching the epic battles of Wakanda and Titan. Thanos couldn't have been pulled off any better in this film either, and truly it captures the essence of what an amazing antagonist should be...",10,2,8,30 April 2018
Get Out," Daniel Kaluuya gives an exceptional performance in this chilling horror wrapped in comedic touches
","Horror films are probably my second favourite genre of movie after science fiction. Not a lot of the time in present day do I find myself actually scared though in regards to having just watched some new 'totally horrifying' film. I've watched at least 60-70 horrors over the last 5/6 years, and I'm satisfied after seeing 2017's Get Out - because there were some truly unsettling, disturbing, creepy, strange, and horrifying scenes. It had me going. Jordan Peele did such a wonderful job as did the whole team. Daniel Kaluuya does a superb job, a total confident display of his fine acting skills solidifying himself as a great star in today's world of actors. The fact is, this film could be seen as a comedy horror because there were some honestly funny scenes all throughout, from the phone scenes to Chris's rampage at the end up to being found to the scene with the tell off the cops in their office what's going on.. there's a good slide of comedy in this film. But first and foremost, before thriller, before comedy, this film is a dark psychological horror. The amount of unsettling scenes was fantastic. Here's the scenes that were truly special: the man running towards Chris, the woman staring at the window, the woman crying, saying 'No..no... no..,' the scene with the photographs, the scene with the woman in the car attacking Chris, the scene with the bingo, the scene with the flash on the camera... these are all scenes that are in every sense of the word disturbing or creepy. Yes, this film really did gave me chills, one of only three films to have done so since 2013: Sinister, The Autopsy of Jane Doe, and this make up the three. The writing is fantastic, all three acts are solid and interesting and have their moments. The pacing is good and the plot of the film gets more deeper and intriguing as it goes on, and by act two I was totally, totally captivated by this extraordinary horror. I see some people say it isn't that good, it's overrated, etc.. judge for yourself, and of course you're entitled to your own opinion... but man, I absolutely loved this. Great film. I highly recommend it.
Favourite scene: the photograph scene/Chris's escape
Scariest scene: woman attacking Chris in the car after she wakes up/man running towards Chris outside at night

Kill Bill: Vol. 1," She will get her revenge... And there will be blood
","Just when I thought my top ten films of all time mini list, that had been unchanged for quite sometime, wouldn't actually change for a while, I go and do something I should have done a long time ago -- I watch both the Kill Bill movies. Or both parts, if that makes it easier. I remember I saw parts of the first instalment about ten years ago, but I never actually saw the film in its entirety. Then Netflix added both to its database, and I watched them last June.I have to say, I haven't enjoyed a film (putting both parts together) like this in years. The sheer enjoyment and fun I endured watching both of these martial arts extravaganzas was a moment I wish I could re-capture. I seriously hate myself for putting them off for so long, but first chance I got, when they were there in front of me, I watched. And I simply adore Kill Bill.The Bride is slick, brutal, gorgeous, and she's out for revenge after being gunned down at a wedding rehearsal by her ex-Husband, Bill, and the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. Presumed dead, the Bride wakes up from a four-year-long coma and after teaching herself to walk and the basics again, sets out to seek revenge on those who tried to end her life --- which only deepens as the film's progress. The violence is never unseen. It's such a brutal and gory and bloody movie, absolutely perfect in its theme and setting though. The anime scene is absolutely beautifully done, intriguing, and a definite highlight for the film. The pacing is so good and each act conveys the martial arts, spaghetti western, action brutality to the fullest. The dialogue is less present in this in comparison with part two, but the dialogue is always interesting and the scenes especially between the Bride and O-Ren are wonderful. The brawls and sword fight scenes are standouts again.Uma Thurman does such a brilliant job as The Bride, my favourite performance she's done. I think it's safe to say they're my favourites by Tarantino as well. These are now two of my ten favourite films. I'd put them in joint position though, to make up for them being two parts of one full film. The first part is the more action-based, epic, bloody-based part with the nice pacing, lengthy showdowns and exquisite choreography/cinematography. I think the intensity and energy in some scenes make this alone one of my favourite action-related films. The high adrenaline and exhilarating beatdowns are insanely good and well-executed. The writing and directing are masterful and the acting is at a good high as well. Everything about the Kill Bill films interests me and I love them. 10/10",10,0,0,26 January 2020
The Dark Knight," Disregard the fact it's somewhat overrated (to an extent), and you've got yourself a fantastic film with both a brilliant protagonist and a terrific - very menacing - villain
","The Dark Knight is about as big a movie you'll get. Let's flash back to 2008 for a second; you're telling me it made over a BILLION as far back as then? Before all that Avatar, 2.7 billion crap? I know there are other movies from beforehand that made this amount of money -- and perhaps a lot more -- but are they the same in regards to quality? No. they're not. The Dark Knight is regarded by many as one of the greatest movies of all time. I can kind of agree with this and I definitely understand why somebody would think this. In terms of perfection, however, that's one thing it is not. I believe -- and I know people out there will agree -- that there truly only is one perfect Batman movie, and that's the first instalment in this trilogy, Batman Begins. This movie is fantastic though, and yes, truly we get one of the finest and most astounding acting performances we've seen on the big screen - Heath Ledger's Joker. Is he my favourite portrayal of the character? I think he possibly could be, movie wise. Overall, I'm certain in saying the performance goes to Mark Hamill. But this is a massively noteworthy and genius performance. I just wish Heath Ledger were alive to see it and to see how much fame and love and admiration he got for this stunning portrayal of one of the best antagonists we've seen or known. Christian Bale is fantastic yet again, too. That Batman voice is awful, though. Still awful. But other than that, great acting. He's a good Batman and a brilliant Bruce Wayne if you ask me. The Dark Knight definitely gets a solid 8, perhaps 8.1./10 from me for its fine acting, direction, cinematography, choreography and for the its chemistry between actors/characters and the dialogue -- specifically between The Joker and The Caped Crusader. An amazing film overall.",9,1,1,24 June 2019
Whiplash," Edge-Of-Your-Seat, Incredibly-Well-Acted Masterpiece in Filmmaking
","Very few films are jaw-dropping in the dramatic aspect, but when they're done right they're always fantastic, and this is one of those very few films of the last ten or so more years to capture the word masterpiece in every way. If acting performances and portrayal wasn't enough then there's phenomenal development, structure, narrative, directing, pacing, chemistry, dialogue, music and so much more. At its highest peak possible WHIPLASH succeeds in captivating the viewer while keeping you at the edge of your seat, and I mean this quite literally. The performance of a lifetime is seen by J.K. Simmons as the overly-harsh, frustrating, almost-antagonistic music conductor, Terence Fletcher. I don't think there are many character portrayals of the last decade which can live up to this one. There are very few. Prominent main star Miles Teller portrays first-year jazz student drummer, Andrew Neiman and also gives a very worthy and fantastic performance, pushing the boundaries of all things passionate, aspiring and ambition. The end performance, toward the end of the final act is absolutely soul-perplexing and bedazzles the viewer, I was totally blown away, I cannot stress enough how jaw-dropping and mesmerising this was. Absolutely transcending; definitely one of my favourite ending scenes to any movie. I HIGHLY recommend this to all movie-lovers, movie-goers, jazz enthusiasts, music aficionados and drama fanatics. 10/10, one of the very best movies of the last twenty five years!",10,0,0,6 July 2019
The Silence of the Lambs," Talk about creepy...
","I think I have seen The Silence of the Lambs six times overall, and I can safely say it is by all means one of the absolute creepiest, eeriest and ugliest (in a fantastic way) movies I have seen in my life. It's almost absurd how creepy this film is. The film is absolutely brilliant. I love it, and the acting performances -- particularly Hopkins and Foster -- are simply wonderful. One of the best films of the nineties for sure. And you know.. it's actually one of the best I have seen in general. Love it.",10,0,1,24 June 2019
Creed II," Truly fitting and enjoyable sequel
","I wanna start off by saying that Creed II is nothing short of greatness and that it's a very good and fitting sequel to its predecessor, the first Creed movie from 2015. Although I'd say Creed is the better of the two films, not by much, however, I will still admit that Creed II gets almost a perfect rating from me. I would say its fight choreography, cinematography and acting are all spectacular and wonderfully done. The progression is fantastic and we see Adonis Creed go from underdog and good boxer to heavyweight champion and true fighter.The antagonist, I found, is really good. It's hard to say if he makes for a better villain than that of 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan from Creed, so I would probably say they're equal. Viktor is a conquering, fierce, vicious villain whose input and training from his father knows no bounds nor limits. It was brilliant seeing Drago return and, although this is a spoiler-free review, I will say that he definitely speaks a lot more in this film (but that's a given, really). Ivan Drago is more experienced and wise in this film of course as it's 33 years later, but the change in his character is terrific.Rocky, of course, is great in the film (as are the co-stars; they're all really good). Stallone's portrayal of elder Rocky Balboa is brilliant in both movies and I love that they center around his character most after Adonis. The bond between him and Adonis is one of my favourite things about the Creed films. So awesome.For me, personally, I genuinely couldn't have asked for a better sequel. I enjoyed every minute of it, both times I saw it, and I honestly hope they make this into a trilogy cause I'd love to see at least one more film. Solid acting, direction, choreography/cinematography, and the rivalry throughout the movie is superb. There really isn't anything more I could ask for. Its ending is particularly fantastic, at least I would say so, despite having seen others say it's predictable. Does that really matter? The film is nonetheless a stellar and really enjoyable sequel with a lot of amazing things happening all-round.Creed II - Solid 9.6/10",10,1,2,2 December 2018
The Breakfast Club," The pinnacle of all coming-of-age movies; dramatic, comedy gold
","Oh boy, what can I say? I can't believe I didn't get round to seeing this until 2016. That's absolutely absurd if you ask me. However, I have since made up for that. Since then. I guarantee I have seen this film over 100 times, and it is my joint-favourite film of all time. I could watch it time and time again, (I have, in fact) and I can quote it word for word. Absolutely brilliant, funny, heartfelt, exciting (Huh, who'd have thought a film with absolutely zero effects could be so intriguing and different), and of course, in terms of emotion it's one of the very, very best. There's five main characters, they're all terrific. I don't dislike one character, not even the main stars out of the five students - both the principle and janitor. Do you enjoy films that are so equally balanced in regards to comedy and drama? This is the perfect example of that. The acting, for its time and for what it's worth? Tremendously good. All characters are, as I have said, simply brilliant. They're all so different yet alike it's ridiculous. The music is also fitting and enjoyable. Plus, the dialogue and interactions between the characters is like no other film I've seen. Subjective , yes, but this is personally my number one movie of any year or decade. The chemistry, considering some of their ages, is almost unbelievable. But believe it, and see it.
Wonderful 80s enjoyment to the highest degree, and absolutely original and superb in so many ways.",10,0,1,5 June 2019
V for Vendetta," An intriguing and comprehensive film offering a lot of insight; fuelled by thought-provoking ambiguity and wonder
","As far as I'm concerned, this is one of the greatest films ever made, despite being relatively unknown in comparison with other films of the genre; whether you see it as a film of its own or a film loosely based off DC comics, there's no denying it's a truly remarkable work of art brought to the big screen (again, from whether or not the perspective is standalone or based).Packed full of exquisite dialogue and fantastic, well-written performances, it's clear and simple as to why it's in my top five. The plot is superbly written and has a lot of depth to it. If you're a fan of ambiguous movies, this one counts. I mean, to me there's a lot of ambiguity involved, but not just in terms of personal opinion, but rather I mean there genuinely is a lot of unanswered stuff. Tremendous as it is, I still don't know whether or not this is my favorite Hugo Weaving role. I loved his role as Agent Smith too, from The Matrix. Actually, no. As much as I adore and love The Matrix, this is the pinnacle mark right here. This is his defining role if you ask me. The saddening thing is that V does, in fact, die at the end... but the day he sought all along doesn't die. It merely even starts. It's just the beginning.... The fact of the matter is this - no face, no worries. You don't even get to see his face once in the film (unless the Rockwood scene counts, but it really doesn't), and it matters not one bit. The voice and the movement are enough. A genius portrayal indeed.All side and co-characters are phenomenal in their respective roles. As it is a joint-character film, the other lead is (as most people will know), Natalie Portman - she is very good in the film, and does a terrific job; and this too is perhaps her defining performance... 
A marvellous film.",10,4,6,20 February 2018
