The Rock," Connery invades San Francisco
","Contains spoilersIf you take Michael Bay, Sean Connery and Hans Zimmer, and mix them together in a big bowl, with a little touch of Alcatraz, what do you get? You guessed right: A slam-bang of an action-thriller. In other words: 'The Rock'.What makes 'The Rock' a good movie. Of course, you have Sean Connery. But what would have made this movie great without Connery. I think a very important element is the music. Hans Zimmer`s music is so engaging and so full of feelings that it had to leave traces in your mind after seeing this movie. Another important element is the great characters. Almost every character builds up a strong personality during the film, and you feel with them, either they are good or evil. At the end I actually felt more sorry for Ed Harris than I did for Nicholas Cage.Sean Connery is dangerously good at his work, a good example is when he smash half of the city with a stolen car, with Nicholas Cage chasing him.My opinion is that this is one of the best action movies I have seen, so if you haven`t seen this one, you know what movie to watch next... and what music to listen at.",9,1,1,11 July 2001
Mission: Impossible," The mission has become possible
","Brian De Palma completed the impossible mission in 1996; he made 'Mission:Impossible.'This is one of the best movies I`ve ever seen in my life. The first time I watched it I didn`t understand so much of the plot(the movie was thrilling back then also of course), but now, when I`ve seen it several times, I understood it more and more. And it just got better and better.It`s still getting better and better. I don`t know where it will stop.And just so you know it; this one is much better than John Woo`s sequel.",10,1,3,11 January 2002
Con Air," 'The Rock's little brother
","CONTAINS SPOILERS!If you are looking for a movie with no brain just for the entertainment, Con Air is the one. This movie has everything you need when you are looking for some fun: big explosions, criminal 'cartoon' maniacs and funny dialogues.I think the (many) action scenes gets even better with Trevor Rabin`s score. It really helps in this entertaining and explosive movie, of course from Jerry Bruckheimer. I don`t know when he`s going to stop making these action movies.You have a lot of evil characters in this film. And when I say a lot, I mean a lot. You have John Malkovich as Frank Hummel 2, Steve Buscemi as Hannibal Lecter 2, and Ving Rhames as Rambo 2, and a lots of more.And of course, in almost every Bruckheimer film, the hero of the day; Nicolas Cage, who`s trying to stop the bad guys. Not alone of course, but with a little help from John Cusack on the ground.Of course Cusack smashes the boss`car, and the comedy tops with a male prisoner dressing up like a woman, and entertaining the other prisoners with dancing. And a couple of explosions at the end of course... in Las Vegas, of course... with a fire truck, of course...  (spoiler!) The good guys win... surprise! And the good guy gets the woman, and Hannibal sets to town for gambling... sorry, I got a little out of hand there...Overall: Bruckheimer has given us an entertaining, funny and amusing action flick, with no brain, which you can watch when you are hungry for some very funny action. But if you are really going for the serious action, you should travel one year back in time, to San Francisco, on a little island, where Big Brother lives; 'The Rock'.Good luck.",Null,0,0,27 July 2001
