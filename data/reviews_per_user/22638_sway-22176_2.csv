Sucker Punch," A movie you must watch multiple times
","You can't form an honest opinion of this movie from watching it only once. It deserves to be watched multiple times, like Donnie Darko or inception. The layers of this movie are so deep, that they can't be noticed the first watch. The visuals are stunning and the girls are had a$$es. The soundtrack only adds to the movie. Such a killer soundtrack.",10,7,8,25 February 2020
