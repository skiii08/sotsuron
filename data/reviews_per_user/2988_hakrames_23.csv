The Avengers," One of the best Superhero films to date
","'The Avengers' is the first 'team up' movie for the MCU combining Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor. Alongside with Black Widow, Hawkeye, Nick Fury, and of course, The Hulk. To fight the maniacal and oddly comical in all the best ways, Loki, Brother of Thor and part Frost Giant. And this movie is everything you could ever think you would want in a super hero collaboration film. Joss Whedon wrote and directed this film to perfection. With the team up of everyone being seamless and interesting with various conflicts throughout and the almost certain that they could never work together ever until the end. Each character feels used amazingly with comedy being brought in perfectly, drama at the perfect times, and a whole hell of a lot of action in this 143 minute film. With expanding on a lot of the small quirks of each character and the nail biting tension throughout the film done by the fantastic direction and great feel of this film. Joss Whedon put in all he could ever do in this film and executed it perfectly. The writing by Whedon is also flawless. When I first saw this film in 2012, I honestly thought these actors were real with how fluent and smooth their dialogue was combined with the A+ acting done too by each and every cast member, even the 'one scene' actors shown throughout. Not a single actor had any opinion in the writing of the film and with solely Whedon writing it, you can see how well of a writer he is and how smooth he can make the conversations in this film. Especially my favorite parts of the dialogue are the small on going jokes throughout the film with each character, it brings the light out of some of the darkest scenes and can make each and everyone as memorable as possible. I remember quoting this film like it was a religious text or something with how well written it is. The acting is once again perfect. Robert Downey Jr. plays once again a flawless Tony Stark with either his smooth and slick execution of every line, to him hiding snacks throughout the sets to add to his quirky character that the audience has grown to love and appreciate in the film. New Comer Mark Ruffalo in the MCU also kills it as Bruce Banner/Hulk with his uneasy performance and social awkwardness too. Everyone else, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Samuel L. Jackson also do amazingly with their roles with a smooth balance of comedy and seriousness in each of their scenes. The casting in this series is still flawless and I don't want to change a single cast member with their respective roles. The Avengers is a fantastic movie that will be put down in history as one of the best superhero movies to ever exist and should deserve its popularity and praise for its technical accomplishment and storytelling milestone.

Iron Man 3," A very good end to the trilogy
","Iron Man 3 (Three), follows Tony Stark after the events of The Avengers and the effects that have come from it and the people around him too. With him having borderline PTSD and a new villain that has an odd connection to Tony in more ways than he would ever want.Iron Man 3 is the first film in the trilogy to not be directed by Jon Favreau but still include him as the memorable and lovable Happy. But instead of Favreau, Legendary writer and director Shane Black takes over with being silent for nearly a decade of not working on any films to break out again with the biggest solo film yet. Black directed the hell out of this third installment and yes there is a tone change from two to three but the barebones of the series are still their with a new and original story and a whole hell of a lot of amazing action sequences. And with Black building a lot of the sets and doing a lot of the stunts in real life instead of digitally adding it in makes this film feel real. Writing wise, the film is overall extremely good, one major piece of the film I didn't like too much but the overall film is very enjoyable and fantastically written as well. Robert Downey Jr. hasn't felt more comical or broken, depending on what way you look at him, with the fantastic writing of his character. Each character in the film has a sense of comedy in a lot better ways than they did back in Iron Man 2 and it makes the film feel a lot more light hearted and more fun as well. And with the physical comedy like Mark-42 and his imperfect quirks in the film with him being a prototype suit makes the film feel real showing a fractured Tony that isn't at 100% and is almost caught off guard in every scene. My biggest issue is during the third act the 'villain' comes off very awkwardly and somewhat upsets me with his write off and destruction of the iconic comic book antagonist. The acting is amazing though with Guy Pearce and Sir Ben Kingsley joining the cast and making some memorable performances throughout out. Obviously Downey Jr., kills it with such a different look at his iconic Tony Stark with him being broken and knocked down from The Avengers and his personal ties in this film. Cheadle also is great with his best performance in the series yet in this film with his dialogue feeling more smoothed out than in Iron Man 2. And of course my favorite performance done by Pearce is haunting and definitely makes a huge impact on the series and shows that the MCU can make a good villain in a stand alone film. With one flaw that is pretty big, this film is great in a lot of other ways and makes the perfect end to a great trilogy. Iron Man 3 gets an 8.75/10",9,1,1,23 March 2018
Wind River," Taylor Sheridan Knocks out Another Masterpiece
","'Wind River' Written and Directed by Taylor Sheridan, Starring Elizabeth Olsen, Jeremy Renner, and Graham Greene. About a rookie FBI agent and big game hunter uncovering the mystery of a young woman who was raped and murdered and left in the snow. The synopsis of the movie may sound like it's another 'murder mystery' type movie but this isn't the case with in depth characters and an intriguing yet simple storyline with some twists that no one can even expect to happen makes this movie worth the viewing. Sheridan taking his first steps on becoming one of the greats with writing has come out and done his first directing job and nailed it perfectly. With some of the lingering shots on objects and scenes to the intense fight scenes that break out randomly to the monologues that are given throughout make chills go down just about anybody's spines. Acting wise it was flawless all around. Renner is unrecognizable as Cory with his chilling past and his ice cold straight face he keeps throughout is mesmerizing. Olsen as Banner is also amazing with them both working on Avengers and Civil War together to this, their on screen chemistry pours out with these A list actors. Even minor roles like Jon Bernthal and Kelsey Chow were great and even Gil Birmingham as the father of the murdered girl is incredible with his straight face in some scenes and others of him breaking down to nothing from the incident that has happened. The pacing of this story is amazing with a balance of strong, interesting drama to some brutal scenes of action that end unexpectedly in twists of huge proportions. My favorite had to be the scenes between Renner and Olsen, and Olsen and Greene when they shared them because they were powerful, sometimes comical in the right points, and all around just moving with morals and differences with their different viewpoints and drives they have for this film. With the minor special effects used in it. It shocks you when it does with it seamlessly being brought into these brutal action scenes that were so satisfying on the first viewing of it. With a flawless and simple story powered by great actors and a head strong director with great action and scene building. There isn't a flaw to this film at all.",10,0,3,30 December 2017
Iron Man 2," A drop in the series but an important one
","Iron Man 2 follows the events of the first Iron Man and takes a turn to change the series into what we know now as the MCU. With many cast members coming back for the sequel we are introduced to a lot of new and fun faces to the series as well. With the introduction to many new beloved characters many fans have fell in love with with every installment added to the Marvel series. Story wise with Iron Man 2 has dropped slightly since the first, feeling more like a bridging movie to set up other movies and the future Avengers movie that came out two years after Iron Man 2. With the introduction of many now beloved faces including Black Widow, War Machine, and the Iconic Nick Fury with Agent Phil Coulson too. This film though did give us a more of an understanding with the arc reactor in Tony's chest and the overall negative aspects of him using it and the Iron Man suit too. Alongside with giving us a darker side of Tony's father, Howard Stark and the more darker stuff he did before his mysterious death 1991. Jon Favreau once again directs the hell out of this film. Feeling more updated and bigger than the fantastic first film. With the use of long uncut takes in many beautiful scenes and action packed ones as well. And with Favreau acting in the film with a much bigger part than the first film, he made himself serve very much as the comic relief in some very action packed scenes and very serious scenes as well. That was the one thing with this film is that it felt much more comical than the first film, which had splashes of comedy put throughout mainly done by Tony Stark himself in very awkward scenes to write them off a lot better. Iron Man 2 though, Many characters just come off as comedians like Sam Rockwell's Justin Hammer is just all around comical and is suppose to serve as a driving force for the main antagonist but comes off as mainly a little prod that keeps poking the antagonist until he breaks out yelling. And that is where I come to the script, a hand full of the lines in this film feel very forced and rushed to either rapidly pass the story forward or to get off some supposedly funny joke that will sometimes come off as just awful and unfunny all around. But the other majority of lines and scenes in this film do have a lot of power to them like the interrogation scene between Tony and Ivan and the phone call too later in the film. Very powerful and gives an almost 'cat and mouse' feel to the film on who will outsmart the other in this race to kill one another. And of course the writing for Black Widow was amazing with the different dialogue and tones she has to do for the different personalities she had to pull off in this film to be that 'agent' status throughout. Action and special effects wise definitely grew a lot more since the first film with many more action scenes and drastically improvement on the CGI work and fight choreographing too to it. Feels a lot more natural during the whole film, thanks to Favreau and his brilliant directing too with it. Iron Man 2 is definitely a let down to the near perfect first film but it definitely is a fun one to watch with its unique characters and bigger and badder fights. Iron Man 2 gets a 7.5/10",7,1,1,11 March 2018
BlacKkKlansman," A well worth watch of historical drama-comedy
","BlacKkKlansman stars John David Washington and Adam Driver as it follows the first black police officer in Colorado Springs as he develops an investigation against the KKK and his suspicion on a possible attack they are about to commit. With having Washington coordinating on the phone with the klansmen and Driver meeting them in person to form one person. This movie I actually have been excited for as I am a fan of Spike Lee and his 'based on true story' films. I loved Malcolm X from him, which ironically had John David Washington in it along side his dad Denzel Washington. And this movie lived up to every expectation I had for it. Spike Lee has always had an interesting way of approaching a topic especially one of controversy like this one. I feel like if any other director took on this film it would come off as being very one sided or even racist. But Lee found that perfect balance with it's amazing visuals and tight dialogue. Going to writing, this is one of Lee's best written scripts to date. The dialogue is both funny and meaningful to show the characters extremely well and how these two detectives are having to change their own beliefs and the way they talk to fit best with the people they're undercover as. Especially some of the scenes, I was laughing out loud in the theater and enjoying every bit of it. One scene towards the end in particular had me laughing and in shock all at once. The acting was once again amazing for Lee. Washington did an amazing job for his breakout role on the big screen as Ron Stallworth. He's hilarious and nobel for taking a role that could have been so racist or interpreted as anything but positive. Driver as well gave once again another amazing performance, possible Oscar worthy. And with him coming from an earlier career of R rated comedies, this type of racist jokes and insults almost fit him. Alongside with his quick reactions to his own lines and his pauses and stutters and with him almost fake acting throughout it makes this film feel so real and grounded all at once. Even some of the other cast members like Alec Baldwin, Robert John Burke, Brian Taratina, and Ryan Eggold. Even Topher Grace as David Duke all fit and were both funny and realistic and shockingly portrayed the characters extremely well based on real footage and documents of the real life people. This film won't be for everyone. They will find it useless or racist or another film to show how bad 'whites' are. But I found this film very enjoyable and entertaining and gave a unique history on our country and what negative things that went on during that time and how it wasn't just a one sided story like what they portray in school or even on documentaries. BlacKkKlansman gets a 9.75/10",9,13,24,14 August 2018
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," A sequel that ups its predecessor in every way
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier is the sequel to the first Captain America Movie and follows the events of The Avengers with expanding on the corporate SHIELD and the secrets they've been hiding in it for decades. And this movie is a huge improvement on the first film. The story is one of the freshest stories have come up with to date with its gritty fight sequences and twists no one can expect at all in this film, all thanks to the Russo Brothers. With the strong direction by the Russo brothers this film gets a face lift from the first and brings the film to a modern age that it needed. Getting away from the '40's and showing a more modern Cap that's still trying to adjust to the new world he has missed since being frozen adds a lot of funny sequences and great one lines that are executed perfectly in this film. My favorite part of this film though is the fights, each scene for them feels brand new and not one feels like a copycat or a recreation of the first movie or anywhere else. And that's one of the best things with this film is the originality that the Russo brothers put into this film. And now with them directing Civil War and Infinity War. They have made a mark in Marvel as being one of the best directors yet. The writing done by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely did a fantastic job on this script. The dialogue feels so real and fits each and every cast member perfectly with its fast jokes and memorable lines throughout. Even the minor characters that we've gotten sneak peaks at in The Avengers have made memorable parts in this film playing key points in the overall story telling. Even Chris Evan and Scarlett Johansson writing the dialogue for the scenes between them feels so natural and adds a huge comedy piece as they try to get Steve a date with anyone in his life. The acting is once again amazing by its key cast (Evans, Johansson, Jackson) with the new faces as well killing each and every role. Especially the broken and confused Bucky/Winter Soldier played by Stan and the quick witted and perfect partner to Steve, Sam Wilson played by Anthony Mackie. And of course my favorite new performance in the film is done by the legendary Robert Redford with his offputting look and twisting dialogue that's shown throughout. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a fantastic film with a single plot hole that, yes, was explained in a deleted scene but never put into the final product is why did he go and get his old suit when he had a modern day battle ready one that was perfectly fine? Captain America: The Winter Soldier gets a 9.5/10",9,1,1,26 March 2018
Ant-Man," Marvel's most hilarious film yet
","Ant Man stars Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/ Ant Man with Michael Douglas, Bobby Cannavale, Corey Stoll, and Evangeline Lilly in this hilarious action film by Marvel. Following the previous event in Age of Ultron, Ant Man dives into the other great minds in the world and the possible small dilemmas created by this privately owned tech and corrupt corporations. Peyton Reed directs this movie beautifully with its fantastic cinematography and great direction with the combination of CGI and practical effects making this movie feel as real as possible with its direction. Sadly in my opinion I would've liked to have legendary director and writer, who created this script for Ant Man, Edgar Wright, to direct this film instead. Reed does a good job with what he was handed and balances everything very smoothly. The script is amazingly written with its tight dialogue and hilarious scenes between various characters, and of course Michael Pena being Michael Pena with his amazing execution and flawless acting. The dialogue feels so fluent I compare it to Iron Man and The Winter Soldiers with the feel of them to this. At some points I forget I'm watching a film and feel like I'm on set myself watching magic get made. And sadly with the writing there are some plot holes with the physics of the shrinking and growing and the 'power' behind some things. Acting overall is flawless. Corey Stoll may be my only pick for a possible miscasting. Up until the final act I didn't feel the impact of his character as an antagonist until that part. I felt more of him being a crazy scientist type of approach. He did fantastic with the script he was handed and he is a great actor but his casting for it to me just didn't fit it for me. Bobby Cannavale I thought was more of an antagonist than him with his sternness and hatred towards Rudd's character for his past actions and even future ones too. Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, and Evangeline Lilly though all fit their roles perfectly and give this movie character and dimensions too with their hilarious yet serious tones throughout. And this movie made me forget how great of a comic Douglas is. Overall this film is very enjoyable and entertaining throughout and has some very memorable scenes, Retrieving a thing from a place with a fan favorite character. With some physics issues and a possible miscasting in my opinion, this movie isn't flawless but it'll get you laughing enough to possibly forget about them.Ant Man gets an 8/10",8,0,0,6 April 2018
Captain America: The First Avenger," A great start for the now forming Avengers crew
","Captain America: The First Avenger is the start of the future avenger movies and the big jump into the now known MCU officially. With the biggest budget and most special effects in the MCU when it was released and a strong cast and stronger performances by an A list cast. Man of the performances in this film come off amazingly and establish their roles very fast and strongly as well. Chris Evans starts does an amazing job as Steve Rogers/Captain America with the before and after the serum is injected into him. Giving this warm and comforting performance throughout making the audience feel like he has everything under control and contained. Similar cast members as well give just as good performances like Hayley Atwell as Peggy and Sebastian Stan as Bucky both. Playing important people in Steve's life and giving him different drives for his actions throughout the film. Even the more minor characters like Stanley Tucci, Tommy Lee Jones, and Dominic Cooper give amazing performances with their varying roles. MIne still being Cooper's performance as the ego driven, slightly mad genius Howard Stark. And of course Hugo Weaving surfacing again for yet another A+ Villain performance as Red Skull. Giving this feeling of constant concern and making the audience want to bite their nails throughout like his iconic performance as Mr. Smith in 'The Matrix'. Directing wise this was Joe Johnston's first and last directing job with marvel but I personally think he did a good job overall. The direction in 'The Winter Soldier' and 'Civil War' though fixed any directing issues I had with this film amazingly though. I did feel that the overuse of fast cuts in many fight scenes got boring and repetitive especially towards the third act minus the final fight of course. And some of the shots of the shield anyone with basics in physics could look at it and question 'how is that shield bouncing particularly in that direction out of nowhere?' type of situation. But many shots were done beautifully by Johnston like the first act I thought was beautiful especially the motion capture work done on Evans to make him so small and weak. Writing wise the script is overall very strong. Some lines of dialogue could've been a little smoother and not so exposition like. An example would be the first scene in the 40's with Red Skull retrieving the Tesseract. But the other scenes play very well with either providing lines of comedy to excellent storytelling provided with great visuals to tell it better. The special effects look the best in The First Avenger by far in the MCU movies coming out over time. A few scenes with small Steve though shows wear and some lacking points of the special effects crew but the rest of the film looks beautiful especially the explosions and various hits done by Cap's shield. Captain America: The First Avenger is a great film and a positive start to the now trilogy for Steve Rogers/Captain America.Captain America: The First Avenger gets an 8.25/10",8,1,1,14 March 2018
Captain America: Civil War," Another Flawless Film Under Marvel's Belt
","Captain America: Civil War, stars Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan and a bunch of other Avengers and new faces in this emotionally driven action, drama, mystery, with a split of the team too for a very good purpose. The Russo brothers from The Winter Soldier come back to direct this masterpiece of a film and they have established themselves as one of the greatest directors in history from this film. With it's slower scenes feeling emotionally impactful and having a proper role to drive the story further and line up some of the best action sequences to date in marvel is one of the infinite things that makes this film perfect. With having the biggest cast out of any movie and the longest run time, this movie feels just like the others and that two hours and twenty-six minutes run time goes by in no time and makes you wanting more after that end credit sequence comes up. The writing by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely makes this movie the most grounded and realistic feeling film to date with it's fluent dialogue and great scene construction on paper. I honestly forgot that these were actors while watching this film because of how real they felt and the emotion in each scene. There isn't a single line of dialogue out of place in this film and making it by far the best script to date for marvel. Even the jokes that came into the film and some of the more comic relief characters made some of the most nail biting scenes funny and joyful at the most perfect times. And with it having such a big cast. It still feels like a Captain America film with the primary focus on Cap and Bucky and them finding the truth about some things. The acting is perfect, more perfect than any other film I believe in the MCU and that's thanks to Marvel casting the most perfect actors for their films and making them some of the most talked about names in history because of them. The biggest highlight for me is the sternness between Rogers and Stark in this film with some hints throughout the previous films on their possible blow up and this film uncorks that tension beautifully. And by the end I was in tears for the overall outcomes and finishing scenes showing the immediate aftermath of the events that have happened in the film. Captain America: Civil War is a flawless film with not a single problem to it between everything it has done and what is has lined up as well for future movies. Captain America: Civil War gets a 10/10",10,0,1,6 April 2018
A Quiet Place," A quiet movie that says a lot
","A Quiet Place was written and directed and stars John Krasinski alongside his real life wife, Emily Blunt with Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe in this fantastically written and directed horror/thriller about not making a single sound. And trust me this movie is making plenty of sounds with how popular and talked about it is for how amazing it is. Krasinski makes extremely bold decisions with this film. Between it's extreme lack of dialogue, I counted only two scenes of dialogue scenes and the rest is from visuals or signing to one another. The direction to this film is amazing and feels like Krasinski has been doing directing his whole life in this film. And the extremely smart choice of Blunt being his on screen wife makes this film one of the most memorable performances by her ever. The writing of this film I can only imagine on script is a lot of parentheses explaining in detail what each character does with their movements and looks and of course the main dialogue is just signing and explaining what they sign throughout it. But the attention to detail with how they explain just about every question I had in this film through visuals and how they have survived so long. And of course some questions they didn't explain but I'm happy they kept them out for pacing and for the chance of ruining the whole story with it possibly becoming an exposition scene from it. The acting is some of the finest acting all year, Every second Blunt or Krasinski was on screen I was mesmerized by their performances and cared so deeply for their characters alongside with the child actors from the first second to final I was worried and wanting to bite my nails for how great they were on this film for nothing to happen to them at all. With this film being so quiet and having very little dialogue I don't really have much to say about it besides see it and get your own opinion on it. But my only complaint with this film is the electrical issues with some places having electricity and others have nothing but candles and lanterns. But besides that this film is fantastic and definitely a film worth seeing multiple times.A Quiet Place gets a 9.5/10",9,2,3,15 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A Proper Turn in the Industry
","May the force be with you. As it is in this film it's full of force and power as this movie is a beast. A non stop action packed movie with one of the strongest narrative pieces since 'Empire Strikes Back'. This multi part story keep anyone who's slightly paying attention intriguing and wanting more. And for the die hard fans it delivers with such 'force' it moves you emotionally. Character and actor wise it gives us exactly what we want. MARK SPEAKS! Carrie, rest her heart, plays an even more powerful and impactful than in 'The Force Awakens'. Daisy and John both are excellent in their respected roles. And even Oscar Isaac having a bigger and more 'comic relief' role. Of course the special effects and action killed. Having more lightsaber scenes and more space fights. And even the scenes of just the force being used is beautiful. 
With the 2 hour and 32 minute runtime it is the longest star wars to date but a well deserved one. And a perfect set up for episode IX.

Guardians of the Galaxy," Another Great movie by Marvel following a unique gang of characters and a fantastic story
","Guardians of the Galaxy stars Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradly Cooper, and Vin Diesel as they form together to defeat the terrible Ronan who is trying to destroy the universe with an infinity stone. And this movie is nearly flawless and stands up to even The Avengers with its team forming comic book mashup. Now legendary writer and director James Gunn wrote this fantastic script that fits every actor perfectly. With Quill being so sarcastic yet heroic in this film in all the wrong ways. Drax with his lack of understanding metaphors and is great comedy of stating everything as bluntly as possible. Rocket with his hilarious sarcasm and big mouth with his amazing jokes about his height and species. And of course groot being the most lovable character in the MCU to date with his small vocabulary and big heart. And even with the writing the smaller characters and with its perfect balance of comedy to story telling makes the script a very enjoyable part of the film. Directing wise Gunn did an amazing job with the direction making this film feel so far away from the MCU but so relevant and relatable and familiar at the same time. Having some fantastic scenes like the final battle scene and the jail scene makes this film so memorable and fun and makes you guessing till the end on what will happen. The acting all around is amazing as well. Pratt as star Lord is one of the best casting since Robert Downing Jr. As iron man. And with the equally great voice acting by Cooper and Diesel makes it almost forgettable that they voiced them. And with the amazing make up on Rooker, Baitista, and Saldana makes them recognisable and makes them as characters fun and fills the screen with joy.

Avengers: Age of Ultron," A slightly weaker sequel to one of the best action movies of all time
","Avengers: Age of Ultron stars Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, and James Spader with the rest of the avengers crew as they make and have to defeat the robot, Ultron, before he tries to destroy the world. Writing wise this movie has some of the most memorable lines and scenes of the series. Including the famous party scene and the intro fight scene as well. But sadly this film lacks with it altering the overall story of the comics and it feeling like a rip off of the first Avengers film and even though it decides to take more of a risk with introducing three new characters and giving an explanation of what exactly the infinity stones are and how many exactly there are too. It doesn't stand up to the first one. With Joss Whedon directing this film again like the first one he still kills it. With a bigger budget and the crew ready to go and kick ass is everything that a comic or movie fan wants. With the beautiful use of CGI to make Ultron feel real and relatable with his roboticness makes the directing of this film top notch. The cast once again is amazing. With Spader killing it as Ultron and his soothing yet uneasy voice he uses in it to give life to this robot makes the film memorable in those senses. And Aaron Taylor Johnson and Elisabeth Olson as the twins, they add a new layer to Stark and show that there are a lot more unique people out there than just the 6 we love. And with Renner having more than roughly 26 minutes of screen time like in the first one. We get more depth of him as a person and as an avenger that makes us as an audience love him more. With the script being not as strong as the previous film. This movie still stands up to being a great MCU film and holding some of my personal favorite scenes in the series. Avengers: Age of Ultron gets a 7.25/10",7,0,0,6 April 2018
Thor," A strong set up movie for the Avengers
","Thor is the introduction of the god of thunder with an introduction and expansion for a lot of other big name characters and plot elements featured later in the MCU. With major characters like Stellan Skarsgard as Professor Erik Selvig, Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson, and Samuel L. Jackson as Agent Nick Fury with the small part by Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye as well with various teasers throughout hinting at more to come possibly years later in the MCU too. Story wise this is my least favorite origin film in the MCU including second stage characters like Ant Man, Dr. Strange, and Guardians of the Galaxy. When I first felt this film I didn't get the same impact I did from watching Iron Man or Captain America in their first movies in the series. And honestly this movie is very much a bridge movie. This was the last film in the series of origin stories until Avengers came out and this movie just exploded with setting up that film. With Tom Hiddleston's Loki being the main villain and the after credit scene setting up Avengers with showing more of Shield too, a lot more than any other film yet. It feels that the story is almost put on the back burner to get what is considered today to be 'the best team up movie of all time'. Even the romance story between Thor and Jane feels weak and hollow during it compared to Pepper and Tony, and Steve and Peggy. Directing wise, Kenneth Branagh, who's famous for 'The Murder on the Orient Express', 'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit', and 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'. Directed this film instead of producing and acting like he typically does in cinema's. Overall this film is probably my least favorite film he's directed because of the over use of dutch angles. I don't mind them when their used sparingly but when every other scene or every third scene is on a very dramatic dutch angle it bugs me and honestly gives me a headache. They also feel misused during production of this film. They worked very well in the interrogation scenes and some of the fight scenes early on but when it's just normal dialogue scenes, it gets sickening. Writing wise done by Ashley Miller, Zack Stentz, and Don Payne. They did a good job defining the dialogue and making each character feel unique with their sentence choices and feel special and not so generic. The small scenes of comedy comes very strongly too like the Stark jokes throughout and Thor adjusting to Earth are very funny and makes some boring scenes enjoyable and almost memorable. The best performance on the whole movie that was written perfectly for Hiddleston is Loki. He comes off so relatable but so hateable as well and it makes the film so much more enjoyable. And especially with his mixed emotion during various scenes makes the audience really puzzled on what his next moves will be.Acting wise and special effects all look good. It bugs me that they bleached Hemsworth's eyebrows though to stick to the blond while in Avengers and every Thor movie after that they stick to his dirty blonde brows instead. But the costume designs and set designs look amazing, by far the biggest production of the MCU so far and the special effects have a big jump in it too compared to even Captain America which came out roughly 3 months before Thor. This film had a lot of potential and sadly fell short on a few things but gave us a strong bridging movie for the upcoming Avengers that premiered a year after this. It is still a fun movie that has some great characters in it and expands the universe for the MCU.Thor gets a 7/10",7,0,0,16 March 2018
The Disaster Artist," The Proper Way to Tell How the Worst Movie Ever Was Made
","The movie based on the best selling book of the same name. Follows Dave Franco (Greg) And James Franco (Tommy) in their journey of becoming friends and making the movie 'The Room'. This movie is brilliant and came out in possibly the most perfect time. With politics high and tension in our country even higher this movie did what it needed, make us laugh. Acting wise it's practically flawless across the board. Give it up for James Franco though for him to act as another person, with an accent, and then have to act as a bad actor while keeping the accent. That's one of the hardest things to do in acting. For directing, James Franco as well knocks it out with his first debut in it. With the use of shacky, long single takes and the switch use of the 'filming' cameras used during the production of the movie and the actual cameras used for the typical filming is brilliant. With an off beat style pace and great pieces of comedy pulled in with a strong narrative and meaningful scenes of heart. This movie is much needed and will be looked at as a testament to films and film making. I'd give it a 9.25/10
For what it accomplished. Just wished it didn't end and kept going!",9,1,3,10 March 2018
12 Strong," Another 9/11 History Movie that Stands out to the Rest
","With countless movies about the tragedy that left America in shock and anger, 12 Strong follows a different story than most with the first attacking line against Osama Bin Laden. The A list cast consisting of Chris Hemsworth, Michael Shannon, And Michael Pena along with others add a good and familiar face to this gritty war drama. Everyone giving good performances across the board even the minor characters and generic soldiers shown throughout the movie as well. The overall story is clear cut and set up within the first 20 minutes and holds strongly throughout. With some Cliches scattered throughout the film that could be clouded over since it is based off of true events. Some of the scenes did feel discriminating with its depictions of americans and the towns and locations throughout. Shockingly there weren't that many action/war as shown in the trailers and promotions for the film but the biggest battle is definitely the most intense with it's feeling of threat and danger most for our cast. But the big battle did have continuity errors throughout with recycled shots of headshots, missile firing and people coming in and out of cover shooting. Overall the movie did well with it's first time director and seeing Hemsworth get back into the uniform and Pena to be himself with his comical side that gave the audience a breath of fresh air in between tense scenes. The movie did pull of tension a lot better than most war movies especially ones that have come out in the past decade possibly and it's non-complicated story made it fun and interesting to allow the story to be driven mainly by the characters after the introduction.",7,2,10,27 January 2018
The Shawshank Redemption," One of the greatest book to movie adaptation to ever exist
","'The Shawshank Redemption' Directed by and written by the fantastic Frank Darabont and this is his first of two adaptation of Stephen King novels he has done. Shawshank follows Tim Robbins, Andy Dufresne as he is wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to serve a double life in prison where he meets Red, played by Morgan Freeman and the movie follows Andy as he makes a big change on Shawshank prison through the years he is staying there and the impact of the various characters make on him and his different viewpoint and symbolic changes he has on his life. In my perspective Shawshank is perfect. It's beautiful narration done by Freeman brings warmth and some great lines of comedy to the screen with the unbelievable performances done by this A list cast and crew. There is not a single scene in this film that I would want to remove, alter, or change to make it better than it is now. And that's from the unbelievable directing power of Darabont. With the attention to detail and this movie being an improvement of King's short he wrote for it. It proves that on a rare case that a movie can be better than the book or in this case the story. There honestly isn't much to say about the writing of this film minus it's flawless. Every line, every word, every sound that is made by the cast is perfect and plays into the finishing act of the film with the huge reveal given. The acting is suburb with even the minor characters being some of the most memorable ones as well. One of the best supporting characters is the library caretaker, Brooks Hatlen who is an older man who doesn't want no harm and wants to just tend to his library and bring education and fun to this dark and depressing prison. And then of course Bob Gunton as Warden and William Sadler as Heywood are some of the greatest antagonists to ever exist in a King adaptation. The Shawshank Redemption is a perfect film and one that is still talked about decades later and will never be forgotten as well.The Shawshank Redemption gets a 10/10",10,0,0,16 March 2018
Black Panther," Black Panter Review
","Black Panther may not be the first leading African American star in a superhero movie but it by far one of the most impactful and memorable ones to ever come out and exist. Black Panther picks up right after the events of Captain America: Civil War following Chadwick Boseman (T'Challa/Black Panther) and the rise of a new king and the struggles that come from the responsibilities of it. Performance wise everyone did a flawless job, between the accents of the Wakanda people to the beautiful, Blade Runner like city designed to the artistic fight scenes and tightly written dialogue creates a movie worth watching. Every character, even Stan Lee with his famous cameo, just come off with such power and leaves the viewers with such impact and lots to think about from each line of dialogue delivered. Both Boseman and Jordan make the ranks of fans and critics favorite characters in the MCU to date along side with the array of supporting actors (Freeman, Gurira, Nyong'o, Whitaker, Kaluuya, and Serkis). Action wise this movie is visually stunning. With Coogler transferring his use of beautiful follow cams from Creed and using the same Cinematographers from Creed and Kingsman: The Secret Service and Kingsman: The Golden Circle to choreograph the fights and film them so flawlessly and beautifully makes Black Panther one of the best action movies of the year by far. Special Effects look beautiful with the Kinetic Suits and the Vibranium infused weapons used by the Wakanda warriors and Boseman. Each site of the city gets more and more beautiful with its subtle yet so appealing to the eyes. By far my favorite was the kinetic energy used when the Black Panther suit was charged up. Ryan Coogler gave it his all with Black Panther and didn't hold back a single bit with is beautifully written film that was directed so perfectly. I was a fan when I saw his work with Jordan on Fruitvale Station back in 2014 and loved his work even more with yet again Jordan in Creed and how Coogler has cemented himself in with the MCU as being one of the best directors working to date. My overall Score for the film has to be a 9.5/10",9,1,4,24 February 2018
Iron Man," A flawless Start to the MCU
","With the start of what we know now as the MCU, Marvel's Iron Man makes a huge impact and starts up a beloved series perfectly in this first installment. With now legendary director Jon Favreau as the director of epic. It proves that superhero movies can be so much more than just corny action flicks that leave the audience with more than just a sour taste in their mouths. Breaking off of the Sam Raimi Spider-Man series to a more serious and more unique story of the billionaire weapons dealer turned superhero after having his chest filled with lead and nearly killing him from it. Every shot in this movie is beautiful and drives the movie and characters further with its great storytelling and various homages to the comics and even the various setups for the future movies to be released in the series. For this now lower budget movie in the MCU at just under $140 Million, it has become a huge influence on the rest of the series and for any future directors as well. Talking about directors, Jon Favreau, he directs the hell out of this film. Every shot like I said is beautiful and each and every angle adds to the whole franchise as well. And with the balance of tones from light hearted comedy to deep metaphoric drama and action sprinkled throughout makes this movie feel real and puts the audience right in the front row to enjoy every second of this two hour film. Acting wise, Robert Downey Jr. does his best acting ever, he is flawless in this film as the Iconic Tony Stark with his oversized ego to his scenes of groundedness too. And with Jon Favreau making a cameo throughout the series as the beloved Happy in it, he proves that he is just fantastic as an actor, writer, and director. Jeff Bridges returns as another beloved antagonist in this film looking extremely different spotting a bald head and thick beard. And of course the various middle-eastern soldiers also do amazing jobs with their comedy and sternness depending on what side has more power. And of course Gwyneth Paltrow kills it as Pepper Potts and sets up one of the best love stories in the MCU to date. The action in this film is flawless, between the comedy bits and one liners used in the film to the overall rustiness of Tony using the suit and not knowing exactly how to control everything in it and what it's full strength is makes every action scene a nail biter for sure. And with the choice to remove any type of music in the major fight scenes makes the whole movie feel more grounded and gritty at the same time. With the start of the MCU going as strong as it physically can, Iron Man is one of the best films in the industry and will stay like this for many many years.Iron Man gets a 9.25/10",10,1,1,10 March 2018
The Greatest Showman," 'The Greatest Showman' Non-Spoiler Review
","'The Greatest Showman' is definitely great in most parts with it's flashy and fast paced-fun musical scenes to it's deep and heart pouring drama scenes with just a great A-List cast and crew in this spectacular production. With Michael Gracey directorial debut, he definitely knew how to open up a show. Visually this movie is stunning with multiple incredible shots of the circus in action with various musical scenes scattered throughout in various locations and it's very witty and fun cast to backup this colorful movie making it stand out from the rest of these serious and deep 'oscar bait' movies coming out before the end of the year. Casting wise everything was amazing. Hugh Jackman put in another perfect performance as the legendary P.T. Barnum with his golden musical voice and cheering smile. With both him looking ragged and practically homeless to being practically prince material he pulls it off to the tee. Alongside with Michelle Williams giving a great performance as his push and support throughout the film and his guide to what he really needs in the world. Even the other cast; Zac Efron coming back into singing where he started with disney amung with Zendaya from the same network, Rebecca Ferguson and Keala Settle both giving full heart and even one spotting one hell of a beard for this film. Singing wise everyone did their own voices and it fit perfectly, my biggest worry going into any musical is the production dubbing in another person's voice and it just not fitting at all. The sets were beautiful between it's homeless side of the story in the first act to the gorgeous ballrooms and fancy mansions shown throughout the rest of the film as well. The sets also played great places for the cast to sing and dance to. My personal favorite being the first bar scene in the film with the song choice and the choreographed dance scene was just beautiful. Even the dance scenes with every act on the stage was amazing with the long single takes and the amount of objects moving was beautiful. With the use of CGI to build some of the bigger views of the city and some of the landscape, it seems seamless with the match of practical built sets and real props. The story was great overall, the songs came in at the best parts to drive the raw emotion into the film. The pacing was overall really well done with some small parts that felt dragged out. But immediately followed by an amazing dance sequence or another singing piece. And even when the singing isn't going on they have a beautiful score to keep the pace and drive of the film rolling just as fast as the trapeze performers in the film. With multiple romances of all different degrees and the build of what has sadly closed recently, the circus is something everyone should (or should have) experienced in their lives one time or another and with it gone 'The Greatest Showman' is a great substitute to that void that many people will have. My biggest problem with the film has to be that a few sequences of time passing could've been stretched out with possibly another dance number or something to show the struggle of it being built instead of it just being there out of nowhere. And then there were a few scenes that were dragged out a bit that were attempted to be corrected by a musical number. But for a first time director he did a brilliant job with this warm-hearted circus filled musical.",8,2,6,24 December 2017
Thor: The Dark World," A let down to a improved sequel
","Thor: The Dark World follows Thor, Son of Odin, after the events of The Avengers with the tension between his brother and him still tense and a new issue caused by family a long time ago affecting his current life with his love and the world he has grown to love too. Alan Taylor does a very good job directing. Improving on the first film with its overuse of dutch angles and keeping the filmmaking more simplistic and stylistic. The best part of the film is the action scenes are very well filmed and beautifully designed with special effects, great direction, and fantastic acting. This is though not Taylor's best film in his career and it sadly is the weakest Thor film in the now trilogy with a lot of issues from the script and some questionable acting choices as well that could come from Taylor or the casting director. Getting to the writing, it feels like each act in the film is written by a completely different person and has a few times that I felt like I was watching a different film completely with each act change. The script portrays the main antagonist as this one sided generic villain that has just one job and it is to destroy the universe, heard of that one before?, yeah me too. And especially with Iron Man 3 having a very rich villain, it falls short on the writing. Besides that the characters written are all good. But I do feel like they were trying to cram in as much as they can into this film which was completely unnecessary for this aftermath film. Then the tone change, with it going from extremely dark and serious scenes to awkward comedy doesn't transfer well at all in this film and honestly doesn't feel like a Marvel film when rewatching it. The acting is overall amazing. Hemsworth drastically improved in this stand alone film compared to the first in his acting. Hiddleston is once again amazing as the god of tricks and his manipulation and use of great plan developing to get what he needs. Even minor characters like Thor's warriors and his mom and dad all are so much stronger than the first film and have a lot more useful parts and more defining roles than the first film which is nice. But the main villain once again comes off bad compared to the rest of the film. It could've been from the prosthetics but his acting comes off so bland and feels like his voice is one of those computer text-to-speech things. But one character compared to an ensemble of amazing actors can be forgotten. With a huge issue of storytelling and a single character that could've been better written and acted. It falls short on its potential as the sequel. Thor: The Dark World gets a 6/10",6,0,0,23 March 2018
Annihilation," The Best Sleeper Film of the Year
","From writer and director Alex Garland, Annihilation is about a team of researchers who go into this unknown zone that has appeared called 'The Shimmer' to investigate what it is, why it's here, and how it's growing and changing its surroundings so rapidly. I was a fan of Garland's last film he wrote and directed, Ex Machina, for his tightly written dialogue and mesmerizing scene development with great acting and a surprising amount of action as well. His work on that film transfers over beautifully to Annihilation with a substantially bigger budget and a wider variety of acting as well. Even though this script has substantially less dialogue than his last film, each and every line is executed beautifully and the audience feels the impact of every one as well. His direction in this movie is flawless with the proper use of slow motion and the mix of special effects and practical makes it mesmerizing every second the cast is in the shimmer. Like I said the dialogue is practically flawless with it's variety of characters and unique builds in this film. The twists written come across very well and are fleshed out beautifully with its amazing cast and great direction. Rob Hardy's work on cinematography is amazing with his offsetting shots and beautifully crafted scenes. With him working on Ex Machina with Garland they have now developed a system that is just pumping out more and more beautiful movies every few years now. Acting wise everyone did a flawless job in this film. Natalie Portman I believe has never done a bad or even a decent performance, when she hits the screen she's impeccable with every role, every character, every scene, every line of dialogue that she executes in every film she's in. Jennifer Jason Leigh did an amazing job once again as Dr. Ventress in this film, I grew a very big liking for her from her performance in The Hateful Eight. Even Gina Rodriguez and Tessa Thompson did amazing jobs for their polar-opposite characters in this film. One of the biggest parts of this film is the make p done on the cast and it's by far the best looking makeup of the year. The scars on characters and tattoos being strategically placed on the characters makes this films story just more and more impactful with every watch. The blood and gore used is beautiful combined with great prosthetics and for gore and creatures as well. Annihilation I believe will be one of the best sleeper movies of the year with it's highly original sci-fi story and great direction and acting with a flawless blend of CGI and practical effects used. My only complaint has to be a subplot that attempts to flesh out Portman's character a bit more, I felt it's not necessary and drags the runtime out a little bit too long. Minus that it's a near perfect sci-fi movie. I have to give this film a 9.25/10",9,2,5,28 February 2018
