Hereditary," Amazing!!
","It's been a long time since i saw a decent new film. I've heard about Ari Aster, so i wanted to check why all this hype surrounding him. Amazing scenes, incredible horror atmosphere, unbelievable acting. I reckon that his perspective of horror might change the term in general. A total masterpiece. It manages to scare you, even after you finish it. Blast!",9,2,7,9 September 2019
