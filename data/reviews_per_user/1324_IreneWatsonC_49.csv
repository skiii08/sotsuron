Black Swan," Black or White
","In today's society, too much pursuit of perfection is actually against yourelf. We must not only reconcile us to this world, but also learn to reconcile us to ourselves. We have to accept imperfect selves. I am not perfect, but part of me are awesome. At the same time, there is no absolute boundary between black and white in human nature. It is difficult to choose when facing temptation. Maybe the movie wants to tell us: always searching for human black and white, restraining inner desires, suppressing the crazy black swan deep in the soul, and where the light comes, there are pure and beautiful white swans.",9,0,0,2 April 2020
Your Name.," Dream
","All encounters in the world are repeated for a long time, even if there is no real met each other, but may be in a dream. After all, dreams are the kind of things that disappear when you wake up. Enjoy the dream, or cherish every person you meet, or tell me your name.",10,0,0,19 March 2020
Catch Me If You Can," Story continues
","Frank treats the world with a game attitude and the secular rules become the tools in his hands. However, we live in the rules. There are no shortcuts in the world, because people who take shortcuts will pay a terrible price. So Frank was finally caught by Carl. But the true story of a real fake continues.",10,0,0,18 April 2020
Se7en," The world is worth fighting for.
","In the movie, Kevin Spacey dedicated a great performance, and the shame he radiated was chilling. John Doe did have a kind of crazy thrill and be full of pride. But for this kind of enthusiasm and philosophy, we have to tell genius like Doe: You are a lunatic. Because, if we allow such a unique genius to let it go, many people in our human society will die. In this movie, we can appreciate the beauty of the perfect mode of noir. By appreciating the glorious movement of formalism, we determine the power of human confidence and common ethics : we dare to face evil and absurdity.",9,0,0,1 April 2020
Zootopia," Utopian story
","Among the many metaphors created by literature and art for human beings, animal is undoubtedly the most appropriate one. The film built up the first impression of Judy rabbit and Nick fox in the audience's mind: the former lively and kind, the latter cunning and sophisticated. In fact, the film begins by playing on, or perhaps playing along with, this stereotype and portraying them exactly as the audience expects them to be. But when you get to the end of the film, you find yourself in the trap of the creators' thinking: zootopia is about an anti-bigoted utopian story.",9,0,0,18 March 2020
The Notebook," Perfect love
","The success of this movie is that it adds a perfect ending to a seemingly falling into a stereotypical love story. And this ending is unexpected and reasonable. It is warm and will continue to appear in your mind because everything looks beautiful. Youth will die, and we will grow old. Perfect love and a happy marriage are the best gifts of fate for ordinary life.",8,1,1,9 April 2020
Knives Out," Restore facts
","If we look at this movie with a murderous purpose, it is not very difficult. However, finding the murder is not the main purpose of this movie, it is to restore the facts. It took two hours to determine that there was no very large space for so many characters to play more completely, which naturally cut off the difficulty for the audience to find the murder. But fortunately, the overall storytelling rhythm is very stable, and it can handle well in the face of so many characters. Moreover, the connection of many details and the final conversion and transmission can be said to be a very complete reasoning movie. No matter what the truth is, whether it is good or evil, as long as the knives out, what is pierced is human nature. Generally speaking, it is a breakthrough movie. Besides, I think that other characters can be more plump. With so many characters, most of them are marginal characters, which is a bit regretful.",8,1,2,5 April 2020
Dead Poets Society," Poetic life
","In educational movies, this movie has always been the top. The teacher in this story is using literature and poetry to inspire students and awaken their imagination and poetry. Life is just a stage for us. It is not important what it is. What is important is what kind of roles and content we want to choose and act on the stage. But there is a principle that you choose and are willing to pursue it with your life. Each of us always thinks about how to look forward and live a fresh life.",10,1,2,13 April 2020
The Prestige," Pursuit
","Magic is the art that not allowed to be debunked. But Borden and Angier kept trying to debunk each other. Angier and Borden, one chose the inhuman technology and since then kept wondering whether he is real or a substitute, and the other chose the inhuman life, living two people into one person. In the values of this movie, the greatest sacrifice should be to endure the life, not to die. Once people get caught in the excessive obsession, it is equivalent to the active exposure of their weaknesses. Borden made use of Angier's obsession with magic to send him to the US. Angier made use of Borden's obsession to trick him into the background and completed his murder. In my opinion, when one's pursuit of art completely overrides one's love for life, the art is no longer art, and one's dedication is not worthy of praise.",9,2,3,31 March 2020
Interstellar," Eternal love
","Interstellar is a movie of a complex debate about relativity, gravity and the meaning of time. It discusses how to strike a balance between the emotional exchanges of love, hope and salvation. The background of the film lies in a distant but recognizable future. The planet almost ran out of resources and the nations disbanded. The movie switches between unexplored and disturbing planetary worlds that exist outside the earth. There are many moments of tears between humans.",9,0,0,20 March 2020
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," The most authentic and multifaceted people
","This movie shows the audience the most authentic and multifaceted people. There is no one or the other in this world, especially when we are talking about a person. To understand a person's many aspects is precisely to understand the possibility of life. Only by understanding the versatility and possibilities of yourself and others can you create such more diverse possibilities.",8,0,0,24 April 2020
The Lost City of Z," The brave
","The film uses three adventures to show the audience Percy Fawcett's unremitting efforts and persistent pursuit of exploring new worlds. The image of this movie is beautiful. Color selection, contrast between light and dark and picture settings are impeccable. I think that the movie is also telling people that the soul is not necessarily imprisoned forever, and may also soar in accordance with the dream. The movie shows the detachment of the brave but the story is normal.",8,0,0,25 April 2020
LÃ©on: The Professional," Loneliness and Love
","Mathilda asked Leon, ' Is life always this hard, or is it just when you're a kid? ' Leon's answer was 'Always like this.' Life seems to be like this, with a bit of lingering bitterness. So everyone who accepts and faces life optimistically deserves to be respected, they are all heroes. Love can make people overcome loneliness and separation, and love recognizes one's own value. Love will accompany Mathilda to continue, and at the same time, Leon has realized the value of his life in love. When they started to change, their human nature gradually moved from incomplete to full.",9,1,2,1 April 2020
Dunkirk," Survival is enough
","There are not many lines in this movie. There are only the desire of characters and the choice of characters under desire. The movie retains enough suspense from beginning to end. Everyone is struggling to survive and wants to go home. When defeat is inevitable, survival is the biggest victory. Nolan did not capture the greatness and magnificence of war, only fear, death and despair. So from Nolan's perspective, all a director can do is bring the audience back to the battlefield at that time, feel what characters feel, and fear what characters fear. But in the end, people still have hope for human nature.",9,2,2,9 April 2020
The Intouchables," Respect
","Throughout the movie, there is no grand theme of life and death, and no final cry for help from a dying man, just one theme that is respect. Too many people in this world are hurting others with their self-righteous good will. Their sympathy and compassion seemingly is a good will, but actually become a harm. In the world, there are many people that may have physical defects, strange ideas and so on. But in any case, everyone is a free human being with an independent personality. Ordinary treatment and accepting different should be the best relationship between people.",9,0,1,31 March 2020
The Exorcist," Devil
","This movie is one of the most classic horror movies in my mind. I can see that some later horror movies were inspired by this. True fear is by no means the imagination from outside the world. On the contrary, it must be based on the deformation of reality. The devil is a distortion of human nature or an amplification of human weakness.",9,0,0,11 April 2020
Spirited Away," Who are you?
","This movie is very touching. Everyone can find their own shadow in every character. People are a complex combination of kindness, greed, loneliness and so on.",10,0,0,16 March 2020
No Country for Old Men," Old
","Old life experience and common sense has been unable to rely on. In the world where the pace of life is getting faster and faster, where rules are constantly being updated, everyone's experience is no longer reliable, including impermanence itself.",8,0,1,24 March 2020
The Fault in Our Stars," Life
","The two protagonists in the movie have overcome their own fears after getting along with each other, falling in love, and experiencing death. Augustus already understood that one should seek a deep-loving admirer, not the admiration of the whole world. Hazel, perhaps when he suffered Augustus 'love and death, also understood his parents' feelings about himself. We all came to this world in order to bear love. Our death also bring pain to those around us. But pain should be felt and can be tolerated too. This is life. Perhaps, when we discuss cancer, the most we think about is probably life itself. There is luck and happiness in life, as well as pain and misfortune.",8,0,0,6 April 2020
Saving Private Ryan," WAR
","In addition to the war scenes and the adventure scenes, the core of the movie is to convey the theme of human nature and the exploration of life. Does life have weight? Ryan was human, and so were the two teammates who died on the team. The Americans are people, and so are captured German soldiers. No matter who dies or who lives, war is a massacre. Once war and life are placed on both sides of the same balance, the word 'destruction' is destined to weigh heavily. Real war movies never shy away from the trauma that human left for their own. However, behind the haze of war, they also reflect the brilliant light of human nature.",10,0,0,23 March 2020
The Chorus," Love and courage in education
","Mr. Mathieu communicated with the students like this: Mathieu asked the children to write their names, ages, and ideal careers on a small piece of paper. The student PÃ©pinot did not know what to write. Only a big warm hand rested lightly on the boy's shoulder, and he patiently and gently asked ... What is teacher-student equality? What is the children's position? That's it. One shot and one picture is enough. I think Mathieu is a teacher of all teachers. What he brings is not only educational skills, techniques and strategies. The most important thing he teaches us is courage: the courage to love, the courage to education and the courage to change.",9,0,0,20 March 2020
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Humanity in times
","The film is a reminder of those bygone times. Those naive yet ignorant, prosperous yet shallow, but rich human times. Like Europe before world war ii, like France and the United States in the 1960s, like Japan during the taisho period, like our brief republic of China and the 1980s. It is the spectacle of a culture in transition from old to new, the fever and dream of history. Although ludicrous and unrealistic, but always see all better than the later era of harsh and cold - in revolution, or creed, or national, or development, or democracy, or consumer, or personality, or liberation of all kinds of banner, pretend or frustrated, or passionate, or serious, or center, or understanding, but his bones was traced to sophisticated and calculating.",9,0,0,16 March 2020
Room," Love
","The little boy is the real leading role. The whole movie story stands on the victim's point of view and pursue psychological help. The stolen years, wounded lives, and the imprisoned soul will be saved by hope and goodwill. Live a good life. Because only living will have new hope. Try to feel good, but also try to see a bigger world. Love will save the all.",9,0,0,24 March 2020
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Just to feel alive again
","We always yearn to do something, but we dare not show our voices. We are afraid of outside speculation, we care about the thoughts of others, we are unable to bear the burden of life, and we often ignore the demands from our hearts. In the movie, the director has added some comedic elements. But there is no lack of sincere and enthusiastic healing power. From the perspective of ordinary workers, the movie has revealed the true meaning of life and life. Maybe everyone can find their own on the role: hesitant and cowardly, in the face of what he wants, he is not willing to give up everything that he is fighting for. The transformation of Walter has given us great courage: Whether facing life or work, we should lead our lives and dare to try and face it.",8,1,2,3 April 2020
A Quiet Place," No sound
","In traditional horror movies, sound is one of the most important elements, but this movie is different: once the sound is emitted, it means that danger and death are coming. Such anti-routine affection films with creative sci-fi thriller and horror coats can indeed achieve great success. But the line setting in this movie is indeed very contradictory. And after the birth of the newborn, why under the floor, the couple can use words instead of sign language to talk about their minds? Just because a mattress is placed at the entrance to produce excellent sound insulation? The logical thinking here is inevitably somewhat whimsical.",6,0,0,5 April 2020
Call Me by Your Name," Love is love
","We will eventually say goodbye to our youth. But regardless of whether the loved one is away or not, we should all thank those who have appeared in our lives. The movie tells us that the same-sex love is no different from our usual love. There are sensitive temptations in the beginning, sweet time in the middle, and regretful differences in the end. As the director said: 'I think in love, when you call the other by your name, that means complete surrender.'",8,2,4,4 April 2020
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Thickness of Life
","A person's life is long enough and short enough. Everyone has their own life trajectory. It is the intersection of different trajectories and different times that make up this complex and changing world. But there is love in everyone's life. Life is only once and cannot be repeated. The length of life cannot be determined, but the thickness of life is determined by ourselves. It's enough to love the person you love and live well until the end, calm and brave.",8,0,1,3 April 2020
Coco," Family affection
","Although I saw the film at home without the atmosphere in the cinema, I was moved to tears. There are always people who think that you can't have a dream and a family. But the truth is, your loving family will support your dreams unconditionally, and you will always have love for them along the way. Perhaps the family is the eternal power to support the dream.",10,0,0,16 March 2020
The Imitation Game," Lonely
","Benedict's interpretation of Turing as a genius character is the highlight of this movie. An unexplained genius image is brilliant under the interpretation of Benedict. Turing, the film presented to the audience, is a lonely person, and there are no more intimate people around him. Others can only see the results, but not the creative process. But the process that ultimately led to this creation is destined to be extremely lonely.",9,1,1,20 April 2020
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Always love
","Love is well illustrated in this movie. Love is accidental collision in the river of time. Life is like a long stream of daily necessities. We search for love in the crowd, attracted by the commonality of our lovers. But the ending is always unsatisfactory. So we have the pain of lovelorn, for the trouble of pursuing but not getting. Life is only a pause in time, all meaning in the moment it happens. No matter how many times you repeat, when you meet love again, you will still feel that the world is beautiful.",9,0,0,31 March 2020
La La Land," Loving you is like loving part of my life
","This movie is infinitely close to when we were young: arrogant, romantic, dreamy, longing for love, but lack of money. Then when we have tasted the hardships and pains of society and finally achieved something, is the person around you still the one you love the most? Only when you have thoroughly pained and loved, can you understand how difficult it is to be innocent love. Only when you let go can you support your dream and fulfill your pursuit. In the end, Mia's fantasy surprised all the audience. This is the fantasy of all sweet love, and it is the most exciting meaning of this movie. I dare say that if there is no final fantasy, or the hero and heroine are together again, this movie will eventually become a second-rate love song and dance drama. Only if you can't get it, can you fully understand the bitterness and sweetness of youth. After all, the most beautiful love is just a flash in the pan. I love you, but I can only wish you happiness. This is the supreme love. This love becomes a part of life and a belief. LA LA LAND, loving you is like loving part of my life.",8,5,6,4 April 2020
Beauty and the Beast," Amazing
","Surprisingly high input, high implied quality, high public posture, among other things, high returns are steady. Women dominate the world's consumption, so to speak. Whether intentional or not, using feminism to lead women's consumerism is a brilliant move in the right time.Last but not least, Emma is sooooo beautiful.",8,0,0,16 March 2020
Whiplash," Beyond limits
","This movie is full of bloody sweat and tears in life, full of irritability and anger. But I have to admit that Fletcher's methods are effective and also very terrible, because it is difficult for everyone to guarantee that they will not be abandoned halfway. Fletcher didn't believe in the warm encouragement, he said: There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job. What he pursues is to force the musicians beyond their own limits with absolutely necessary brutal means, and they will never be discouraged by pressure. All the wonderful and amazing appearances come from long-term preparation and unremitting efforts. Therefore, without paying hard work and persevering with perspiration, tears, or even blood, how can you achieve a remarkable life?",10,0,0,10 April 2020
Jaws," A classic
","The movie is a classic that has been around for 30 years. In this movie, Spielberg also shows his outstanding directorial talent. Whether the structure of the arrangement or the release of freely is always in a smooth way of narration. In fact, everyone comes with a story, in the end, they have to give themselves an account.",9,2,4,25 March 2020
The Lion King," You are your own king.
","Just like the classic saying, what is in front of you is the right way and the easy way, which one do you choose? Do you choose to bury the trauma and live a simple life, or do you choose to face it and overcome it and live a glorious life? When Rafiki says 'It's time', it means that Simba has completed his baptism of life. At the end of the movie, Simba steps heavily on the stone of glory in the rain in the tragic music. When he inherits the country, what he is about to face is not the smooth and glorious life, but the real and cruel life. But this is the real world. When you step out, you are your own king!",9,1,1,21 March 2020
Inception," Dream
","A dreamer never cowardice to hide in their own imaginary dreams and is always brave to face the cold and cruel reality and dare to ask himself - 'who am I? This is the great man and the life everyone wants. If this life is a dream, let me sleep until the natural wake up. I will accept all the reality and love the dream, also will not refuse the reality.",9,2,3,23 March 2020
WALLÂ·E," Future of Earth
","The movie highlights a love story and creates an emotional character. In addition to being moving, this movie also gives a lesson of environmental protection to human beings, and causes the audience to think about their own behavior and the future of the earth. How will human beings deal with the deteriorating ecology of the earth? Is the growing sophistication and development of artificial intelligence a curse or a blessing? A more meaningful question is 'what is love'? I think love is longing for love even if the world is going to end.",9,0,0,22 March 2020
Arrival," Cognitive game
","Between people, because of the different growth environment and culture, there are actually cognitive differences. This difference will lead to cognitive contradictions. If two people must face each other, a cognitive game will be formed. Once entering the game link, it is likely to produce emotional conflict. Just like the misunderstanding of communication caused by different languages and cultures, both sides are right, but they have different perceptions and conflict. If one party's cognition is too stubborn, and the other party's communication skills are not very strong, it will not be able to effectively communicate and collaborate, and even lead to a cold war or a real war. The main storytelling behind the movie is unknown. What I want to see most is how to crack the text but it does not seem to be very clear.",7,0,0,4 April 2020
Despicable Me," The world is always a good place.
","Movie plot fairy tale. In the eyes of children also just so, no matter how big conspiracy is not a crazy game. The film careful depict every role. Gru covers his fragile with badness. Victor mentality malformation by father's contempt. Three little different queer, a simple and naive, a novel imagination, a mature. What more magical is each minion also have its own ideas and it's own personality. Each minion is like the soul of every living. They are not background is not a group of play and they are also good for movies doing their part.Gru is a bad guy, but we can see that he's vulnerable inside, and that he's bad and strong in disguise. He stole the moon because his mother killed his space dream when he was a child.",8,0,1,17 March 2020
Son of Saul," Freedom
","The movie deliberately obscures the bloody and cruel violent acts in the immediate vicinity, but conveys invisible events through his voice. The shaking picture is like a personal experience of entering hell. This real feeling makes the audience more deeply impressed with the cruelty. Although there are some coincident plots in this story, it is more humane from the perspective of reflective war. We experience the painful, desperate, and oppressive days in history from the long and cumbersome character life scenes. The little boy who fled at the end of the movie seems to be pinning Thor's spirit. He represents love, hope and freedom.",8,0,1,26 April 2020
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Good memories

Every character is so powerful. I will always be a crazy fan of Harry Potter. Especially, I love Emma. She is super brilliant and beautiful.",9,2,2,24 March 2020
Rear Window," WINDOW: Observe the beauty and ugliness of human nature
","This is a great movie with profound and moral paradoxes. The premise of the film is the existence of a criminal act. So the movie seems to tell viewers that voyeurism is immoral, but it is precisely because of this immoral behavior that it prevents the crime itself and thus creates a sense of justice. Hitchcock used his films to explain this human natural desire. He used his movie to make us understand: peeping is universal in everyone's heart. However, excessive peeping goes beyond the boundaries of morality and even law. From this perspective, the restraint of civilization has caused the depression of humanity to a certain extent. We need to comply with both constraints and instincts, and there is a certain conflict between the two. As an external window, it also plays a media role for the observer to observe the inner heart of the person. Interestingly, the observer's peeping behavior is also a manifestation of human nature.",10,2,2,23 March 2020
The Truman Show," Break
","Although the show is fake, Truman is real. What Truman wants is a free life, not just a show on the screen. When Truman ties himself to the ship and sails through the waves, the whole world weeps for him. It's like the person who broke through obstacles and found his life is like himself. Because Truman dares to fight for fate, which most people can't do. The fear of life comes from ourselves. Life is either sinking or rising. We believe that one day, you and I will break free from the shackles like Truman. Even if we move forward with a heavy load, we must live our lives. In this world, there are always people who want you to be yourself, because everyone is eager to be self.",9,1,1,2 April 2020

Me Before You," Love and Life
","There are many kinds of love in this world. Love cannot be precisely defined. Probably the best love is not to let the other person sacrifice and bond, but to make the loved one realize his true self. This movie only feels the meaning of love through the details, and the meaning of love for the existence and passing of life.",8,1,1,3 April 2020

","The world belongs to young people. Young people don't need to follow the rules. They just need to create the rules. Young people can gain a foothold by stretching their personality. It also inadvertently tells everyone that the information age is an era of robbers, and everything must be fast. Not to mention any delays, everything should be resolved in the fastest and decisive way.

Jurassic Park," SCIENCE
","Due to the high development of technology, the movie used a lot of computer special effects. But Spielberg even used the genetic engineering of dinosaurs to raise questions about modern science: can science make human beings think they are the masters of the world and can dominate and surpass nature? The director's answer, of course, is no. It can be seen that this reflects the modern western understanding of the limitations of science after the reflection on science since the 20th century. Science cannot be an excuse for human hubris. However, this does not affect the greatness of science. After all, because of the development of science, we can see the dinosaurs in the movie.",9,0,0,22 March 2020
