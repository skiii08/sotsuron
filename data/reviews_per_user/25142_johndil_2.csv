The Blair Witch Project," More thriller than horror.
","As you don't actually see, what/who was terrorising the film makers & there is no gore, I can see why some mainstream horror fans dislike this movie, its not a 'Friday the 13'th' slashfest or 'Scream' teenybop type of film (both of which I also like!), its much more basic,thought-provoking & realistic. The aforementioned films are full of false jumpy bits & periodic killings to entertain while you munch your popcorn, which is great but BWP takes a different approach,...realism, most of us have camped out in tents & dens & can actually imagine how the film makers feel & how the tempers fray when they cannot find their way out of the forest. Its a relatively short film, the decline of their enthusiasm, friendship & to some degree their sanity is well paced, eventually desperation sets in & we are given a decent if different 'conclusion' to the film. Forget the hype & just watch it with an open mind. *****if you have the DVD be sure to watch the excellent spoof mockumentary first,..sets the film up a treat***** 9-10. Minor downers:-BWP2! Basic plot, camera angles, camera shots & the much seen torch under the chin shot, were all 'borrowed' from 'The last broadcast.'",9,0,1,4 March 2003
The Shining," A classic,....seriously...
","& the star of the show is,......................the hotel,....Jack is superb but the casting directors or whoever thought of the location deserve an oscar, its a film of minimal cast & little sfx but is as scary as hell,..the size of the place,...retro carpets & curtains, the isolation, the atmosphere the Hotel generates, its just so simple yet so brilliant,...goes to show you dont need massive budgets & a cast of A lists to make a superb film. BRILLIANT!!!! ( My mistake Jack is A+++ ;-) )",10,0,1,30 January 2003
