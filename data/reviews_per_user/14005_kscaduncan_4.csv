Alien 3," Not a disappointment!
","I feel it is a shame that Alien 3 is so underrated. It is nowhere near as bad as people say it is. While it certainly isn't better then the first two, it is a very good sequel. David Fincher ( who would later direct Seven and Fight Club ) was not afraid to make his own unique contribution to the Alien saga and there is more material that exists that was cut out of the film. If the film was issued as a director's cut, then I think people would like it more. The concepts of a prison planet which has a handful of remaining prisoners who have turned to religion to pass the time and that there are no heavy weapons on the planet are very interesting. The Alien effects are very good when done by traditional methods but CGI is not a godsend! These scenes look terrible as it is easy to see that it is just a Computer Image. However, the cast give excellent performances especially Ms. Weaver as Ripley and the prison planet looks stunning. It's very impressive for a 9 year old film but the CGI is absolute crap! Overall, it is a film worth seeing and is not a mess like everyone says it is.",Null,0,3,26 February 2001
Alien," A True classic.
","After seeing James Cameron's Aliens, I decided to check out Alien. So I rented the DVD from my local Blockbuster. I must say that I was not disappointed. Even though the film is 21 years old, it is still as great and fresh as it was back in 1979. Watching the DVD, it makes it look so fresh that it could have only been released last week! Nearly everyone knows what this is about so I won't say anything. What I will say is that it is a well made, suspense filled and occasionly gory film. The effects are great ( especially the alien ) and are not dated in any way. The small cast are excellent and the set design is wonderful. If you get the DVD version, there are about a dozen scenes not included in the original such as a full view of the Alien in one attack shot and a much talked about scene which would have made the ending to James Cameron's Aliens impossible.Overall, an excellent example of Science Fiction that is well worth seeing.",Null,0,1,25 February 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Absoluetly Fantastic!!!
","When I saw Lord of the Rings, it was the first time I had been to the cinema since November 2000 when I saw Little Nicky. Although I enjoyed it and thought it didn't deserve the treatment it had received, it does not even compare to this wonderful epic! I haven't read the book so I don't know how different it is from that.There is no point of me explaining the plot so I'll just say how good it is. I've noticed this film is even similiar to Star Wars! Gandalf's demise and extreme emotion from Frodo echoes Obi-Wan's demise and Luke's unhappiness from Star Wars. Also, both Alec Guiness and Ian McKellen have received oscar nominations. LOTR has received 13 nominations. I hope it wins them all.The only negative point is the ending. Although I know it is a long saga split into 3 films, I was hoping for a better ending. I'm not saying the ending was bad or anything but it was a bit of a dull way to end it. Throughout it's 3 hour length, the film has enough endings for 6 films!!
If you have not seen this film, then I advise to see it at once! This is one of the best films I've seen in a long time and is a promising start to what looks like being one of the best movie trilogys of all time.",Null,0,0,18 February 2002
Aliens," One of the best Sci-Fi sequels ever!
","I bought a copy of this on DVD recently as I had wanted to see it for some time and I thought that this was the best way to. My purchase was not a waste of money. Some people say sequels are nowhere near as good as the original and they are right. The Alien saga does not fit in this category although I have yet to see Alien 3 and I have seen the 4th but not all of it and I thought that was okay. Aliens is one of the best sequels I have ever seen. It may be longer than the first ( my version is the Special Edition which lasts 148 minutes ) but it is just as good if not better. Ripley wakes up after 57 years of hypersleep and finds that the planet where she found the alien has now been colonised. But they have lost contact with the colonists and Ripley goes along with a bunch of marines to see what has happened. All they find is a little girl and a whole load of Aliens! While the first had only one alien and was rarely seen in full, this one is an alien overload! No matter how many bullets are used, they just keep on coming. And later, we are introduced to the Alien Queen who has a fight with a power-suited Ripley at the climax. This film is now 15 years old but like the first it has not dated. The Alien effects are so cool especially the Queen. Just goes to show that you don't always need CGI effects! Although this is more of an action film, there is quite a bit of gore and there are also some tense moments. The acting is on par with the first and James Cameron does a great job in continuing the saga. And of course there is the great score by James Horner. Overall, a classic sequel to a classic film.",Null,0,0,25 February 2001
