The Avengers," Great character development
",I appreciate how they made sure to introduce each character before bringing them together for an epic fight to defend the Earth. It gives much more depth to each superhero.,9,0,0,9 December 2019
Spider-Man 2," Still as good as the first one

Spider-Man 3," Entertaining but not the best

Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Amazing animation and visuals!
",Sony really nails making character movement look detailed and pronounced.,10,0,1,9 December 2019

Avengers: Age of Ultron," Still good superhero fun
","I see a lot of negative reviews directed at the humor in this movie. All I can say is that Marvel, since the beginning, has used this same format for their movies so I don't understand why 'fans' are now criticizing the banter.",9,0,0,9 December 2019
