Howl's Moving Castle," Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli fail to live up to their otherwise well deserved reputation.
","Nausicaä, Laputa, My Neighbour Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, Princess Mononoké, Spirited Away... each of these films raised the bar for both the quality of art and story telling we expect when Studio Ghibli produces an animé directed by Hayao Miyazaki. Unfortunately, Howl's Moving Castle is not the shining example of Ghibli's/Miyazaki's best work.The art, often reminiscent of Nausicaä, might have been considered stunning several years ago, but having been spoiled by visual masterpieces like Princess Mononoké and Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle simply fails to impress and often seems dated, both in terms of character drawing and background art. True, there are moments of artistic brilliance; however, the competent but ultimately uninspired body of this picture's artwork overshadows these moments. Perhaps Howl's worst failing is the unacceptably unrealistic rendering of the 'old' main character.As is often the case in movies originating in Japan, character motivation tends not to be explored and may seem confusingly unclear at times. Studio Ghibli/Miyazaki have consistently overcome this stereotype with well-defined scripts and superior direction in their previous films; yet in Howl's they take a step backwards and often leave the audience scratching our heads wondering why the characters are behaving the way they do.The sound effects, music, and voice acting are all well done -- with one glaring exception: Billy Crystal's performance as the fire demon Calcifer. Try to imagine Billy Crystal's brilliant performance as Miracle Max in The Princess Bride. Now take away the sarcasm and anger, and what you are left with is the almost emotionally dead portrayal of what otherwise could have been a very entertaining character. Why either Rick Dempsey or Peter Docter, who are both experienced voice directors, chose to allow this is truly puzzling.Overall, Howl's Moving Castle is an enjoyable enough movie, particularly for children who may not notice it's many flaws. However, animé fans have come to expect much more from Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki and are bound to be disappointed.",8,3,11,29 September 2005
Green Room," Well worth watching despite typical suspense-flim plot holes and blunders.
","I'd never heard of this movie before, I don't generally care for this genre, and nothing about the description made me think I would enjoy Green Room, but it was well rated when I looked it up so I decided to watch it anyway and I was very pleasantly surprised by how good it was.This sort of movie is usually full of plot holes so big they ruin they completely ruin the movie, and though there are two glaringly obvious ones as well as some moments of very questionable reasoning, nothing in the Green Room had me giving the finger to the screen. In fact, not only was I able to get past these scenes and continue enjoying the movie, my biggest criticism turns out to be trying to end the movie with a joke that just doesn't land instead of with 'the orchard' scene just a moment earlier that almost screams 'fade to black and roll the credits now'.If you can tolerate some very poor medical knowledge, a repeated 'try using that thing right there' blunder, and magic dogs, Green Room is one of the better suspense films and worth watching.",8,0,1,1 June 2020
Elizabeth," All the right elements but yet fails to become a compelling drama.
","Nothing about Elizabeth is particularly memorable. That is not to say it is a bad film, it's just not a particularly good one. I generally enjoy historical dramas, and Elizabeth had a good cast of quality actors, good costume design, good sets, and good filmography; yet, though never boring, it somehow fell short of the mark and failed to captivate my interest.",6,0,0,1 June 2020
Juno," Product placements and an emotionless teenager: Simply terrible.
","'Juno' had a decent cast and could have been a good movie. Rather than go for the more traditional honest look at teen pregnancy they tried to create something 'unique', but they strayed too far from reality to be believable and simultaneously lacked the comedy to create a farce, resulting in a very disappointing movie with no identity.The premise the audience is supposed to accept is that this pregnant teenager has absolutely no concerns or angst throughout the entire duration of her pregnancy. Unfortunately this is very unconvincingly portrayed, and being as this the pivotal plot device this is also the reason this movie fails so miserably.To add insult to injury were the longest and most blatant product placements I've ever been subjected to. I'm not against product placements per se, but this movie is riddled with ads from start to finish including the entire opening being a several minute long ad for Sunny D and Tic-Tacs that weren't just eaten throughout the movie, they were talked about.Clearly I'm in the minority considering the average rating for 'Juno' on IMDb, but the two or three good scenes were not enough to redeem this otherwise misguided production.",3,5,12,19 July 2010
Get Out," Perfect near-to-last line of the movie makes up for every flaw.
","Contrary to how this movie was marketed, the closest this film gets to being a horror is the horribly dumb, obvious, and impossible moments in the final act; however, if you keep watching after you find yourself repeatedly flipping the bird at the screen your patience will be rewarded with the perfect near-to-last line of the movie which more than makes up for every shortcoming in pure entertainment value.",8,0,1,8 May 2020
