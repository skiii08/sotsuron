","Today i had the very unfortunate pleasure of watch this extremely slow paced movie, every thing was good except the paceI went in with high expectation but ended up napping half way through the movie, the movie did every thing what i was not expecting from it,I was hoping it to be the movie of the year a cinematic symphony but unfortunately it was a cinematic catastrophe. maybe i am being too mean, but on the other hand I am trying to figure out what happened to the high budget which was set aside for this sequel lets hope the get the last one rite",6,8,12,2 January 2015
