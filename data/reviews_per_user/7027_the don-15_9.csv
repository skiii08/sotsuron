Vertigo," did he train you? did he rehearse you?
","my 3rd favorite movie of all time is without a doubt Vertigo, i mean Alfred Hitchcock the greatese director of all time in  i think is ONE of his greatest films. James Stewart gives a dynamic performances as a retired police detective who has vertigo who falls for a woman he was hired to follow. Kim Novak in a spectacular performance as 2 amazing characters...and thats where i stop  all i can tell you is the end is brethtaking...10 out of 10",10,2,4,9 July 2001
Scarface," to all my home boys and home girls ur all great
","I HATED THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!  BLAAHHHHHHHH i cant stand this movie, it is nothing but a violent mix of guns and violence. okay Al Pacino, my fvorite actor of all time in a nothing movie. Scarface is a horrible movie, it has no point, woopie another shootem up action movie. this movie was a waste of my time, and i bought it without seeing it, bad move. um 6/10",5,0,8,8 July 2001
The Godfather: Part II," a terrific film
","The Godfather part II is a terrific film by itself. Only Francis Ford Coppola could create an excellent sequel. The film is full of great performances including Pacino, Deniro, Duvall and Cazale. The film isnt better than the orignal but its just as good as the orignal. what more can i say about this film..its terrific! 10 out of 10",10,0,3,1 June 2001
American Beauty," DEFINITELY NOT THE BEST FILM OF 99'
","im sorry but, i dont like this film, yes i get the message at the end of the film, but i dont know why people think it is so spectacular or whatever, its a tolerable movie, Kevin Spacey is a great actor probably one of my favs but he gives an average performance in this film, i feel Russell Crowe should have won best actor for sure for the insider. The movie isnt even that good, the ending has a good message but the plot and the story is fussy and not well written, sam mendes is an average director and could have made a better film than this,...not totally bad, but overrated..7.2 outta 10",7,0,0,14 August 2001
Reservoir Dogs," I LOVE IT!!!!!!! but.....
","When i first saw this movie  i didnt know what to expect but to tell you the truth i loved the whole thing. The writing was great-Tarrantino is the best screenwriter in cinema history. i mean the cast is superb, Buschemi, Roth, Tierney, Madison and Penn are great in this heist gone wrong picture. I love the conversations like the beginging when there talking about tipping. wonderful but the violence in it is strong  and some parts are violent  but the end is great. superb. 10 out of 10",Null,0,1,8 July 2001
Pulp Fiction," i buy the gourmet expensive stuff cause when i drink it i wanna taste it
","WOW... another example of Tarrantino's brilliance.  Travolta, Jackson, Thurman , KEITEL, Walken, Willis, Rhames, Roth and whoever i may have left out are brilliant in this very original picture about a LA gang. Travolta, in his comeback role, gives one of his best pictures sicne the 70's. The film is very original and deserved an oscar. This is one of my favorite films and NO DOUBT TARRATINOS BEST FILM. this is a brilliant piece of filmmaking.. 10 out of 10.",9,0,1,9 July 2001
The Godfather: Part III," eh not bad
","this movie is underrated cause well if you think about it is a good movie as its own  it doesnt live up to the first two but it has some good points in it. i like how michael is depicted in this one he is nearing death and he wants to clean his sins with holy water, and andy garcia has the qualitys of sonny and sometimes as an early michael.the plot is good but..here comes the but..there are flaws ..first  robert duvall should have been in it.. he should have..second  sofia coppola...god bless her should have been replaced by wynonna rider.and  second the movie is missing one thing all of the movies or the first two have been father to son and in this one  it is father to daughter?  i mean she shouldnt have been givin that much screen time in it...but overall this movie is pretty good in its own ways. but it is a wonderfull ending to the corleone saga. 8/10",8,1,2,8 July 2001
Raging Bull," so for the second time...
","this movie was a great movie. i loved this movie on many terms, robert deniro  gives an excellent performance as middle weight champion Jake La Motta. La motta isnt the hero he is a monster and you should not like him in the movie. Martin Scorsese's best movie and ONE of Deniros best. 10 out of 10",10,1,1,9 July 2001
The Godfather," Bravo, This is a cinematic masterpiece
","The Godfather is the greatest movie ever made and it is one of the few movies that doesn't have a single flaw in it. The direction in the Godfather is superb and he acting in the movie is excellent, Marlon Brando gives us one of his best performances. Frances Ford Coppola makes the movie focus more on the family than on anything else and is much more than a gangster movie, it is more about family. The Movie is a film noir perfect in every way. 10 OUT OF 10.",10,0,2,12 November 2000
