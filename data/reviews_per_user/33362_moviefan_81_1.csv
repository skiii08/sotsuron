Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," decent by itself, and nice setup to next.
","A lot of people didn't like this movie, and their reasons are valid.  The dialogue was bad, which in turned made the actors seem not that great.  Jar Jar was definitely annoying.  But the movie as a whole was still entertaining.  I loved the Jedi fights, and the pod race.  The CGI robots and other creatures i thought were well done visually, and the story did have a point and a plot.  Unfortunately, its mostly a set up movie for the next one, which also hurts it.  But overall, it was enjoyable and fun, and definitely worth seeing.I also want to address the age difference between Padme and Anakin.  I've read a few posts that think that the age difference is just plain wrong. The thing is, those people had the ages of the characters wrong to begin with.  I read somewhere that Anakin is supposed to be 9, and the young queen is supposed to be 14.  So for this next movie, they will be 19 and 24, which i don't think is that bad.  Certainly not as bad as the 10, 15 year difference that some people thought was between them.",8,0,1,22 April 2002
