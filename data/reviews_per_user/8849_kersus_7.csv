The Blair Witch Project," They were the ones who did it!
","This was a brand new unique movie. Many people were left with, 'I could have made this movie myself!' Y'know, it is absolutely true. Many people could have made this movie in their back yard with a few acres of woods.The fact is that those who did this movie were simply the first to put it on big screen. They deserve kudos for that, not jealousy. This movie makes it because it's so different than other movies. It's nifty and enjoyable. It can even be watched a few times, but isn't really one you'll watch over and over as the years go by.The camera shots can be hard on the eyes, and the whole movie can give you a headache, but this is a movie most people should see.",9,0,2,16 March 2005
The Ring," Scary but not rewatcheable.
","I gave this a 9 only because the movie isn't one to buy for watching over and over. Otherwise, I thought the first time through it was a 10. Everyone I know who watched it were just 'WOWed' by it.It's scary, has a good storyline and decent acting. While not action packed, it keeps you glued. The ideas presented in it can certainly give you a jump when your phone rings. Definitely watch it, at night, alone (or with a member of the opposite sex), and you will enjoy it. It might also be enjoyable for groups of young friends. As with most serious scary movies - you don't want people who lighten the mood. Stay in the right ambiance and you will be frightened.Not a recommended purchase (DVD/VHS) for most.",9,1,4,16 March 2005
Captain Marvel," Djimon Hounsou is Good
","The acting itself is good (except maybe Ronan - but that's a tough role).Everything else is hogwash. After 90 minutes you think a movie is going to start but it only lasts for a couple minutes and then back to hogwash. There is nothing redeemable about the final product except that the original story had potential.It could be remade into something worth watching but as this stands it's not only missable, Captain Marvel will steal a couple precious hours of life you'll want back.",1,32,53,31 May 2019
Alexander," The film that will never end.
","One could argue that this is a two star film only on the acting, which wasn't bad at all. The writing and directing was horrible, and I can't believe Oliver Stone made this movie. What could have been the movie of the year was a waste of time.It presents itself more as a history documentary than an action/drama movie. Thus you have very little in the way of character development or plot. Yet it doesn't even give one a good grasp of the history. The script was just terrible. There is no clear view of what is going on at all times. None of the secondary characters were developed at all.The battle scenes were jumpy and not exciting. There was no overview of the battles so you can't really see what's going on. The action sequences were poorly made. Only the horse vs. the elephant had any presence and it's a long movie to watch if you're waiting for that.While one cannot blame the actor's for this movie, it was indeed a long terrible slow painful waste of time. Even Angelina Jolie actually put up a decent performance (although casting her as Colin Farrell's mother who doesn't age in 25 years is a little iffy), yet none of the acting in the world could have saved this movie.It's hard to offer a real analysis of this film because it had no real good points to work with. Just do not see this expecting well made battle scenes, or words that hit the heart, or moving drama, or anything good that can come from a movie. All is lost here.All in all, I knew it was a movie I had to see anyway. I have deep interest in history and Alexander and the mythology of the time. For me it was worth the risk, but this movie will never be owned by me or watched again. It doesn't even contain anything of little interest. It isn't what I would expect from Oliver Stone. It isn't a new interesting angle. It isn't the truth no one wants to hear. It isn't really accurate.ALSO The 2 Disc Director's Cut DVD features - VERY SPARSE! There are a couple trailers (which are well made and are not representative of the movie) for the movie and a documentary. The two discs is a marketing gimmick only. It could easily have fit on one disc and you'd still be disappointed in the lack of extras.",1,14,25,3 August 2005
Troy," Legends of the Fall Part 2
","Well, this movie had a lot of hype, and in some ways really delivered. The battle scenes were well done and exciting. There wasn't too much fast moving camera so you could at least follow the fight scenes a bit. The overall feel of the movie was enjoyable and the movie did what it set out to do. It made you love the characters they want you to love, feel sorry for the appropriate ones and hate others. All well directed.For the most part the cast was excellent. Eric Bana and Brian Cox really steal the show as Hector and Agamamnon respectively. Brendan Gleeson was also superb as Menelaus. Orlando Bloom, Diane Kruger, Garrett Hedlund, and Peter O'Toole put up respectable performances. Another borderline scene stealer was Sean Bean as Odysseus. Brad Pitt however was utterly unpleasant. While I'm sure some ladies liked how he looked, he was the only misfit in the movie and was totally out of place in his role. Unfortunately this really wasn't so much a movie about Troy as it was about Achilles, which meant a lot of unpleasant scenes with an actor who wasn't holding his own. This alone almost ruined the movie, but the shoulders of Bana, Gleeson, Cox, and Bean were able to make this a movie worth watching.Now, while this doesn't detract directly from the movie, it isn't a very exact representation of the Illiad. People die at the wrong times, the wrong people live, and basically it's simply a movie inspired by the Illiad. I won't go into specifics as I don't want to spoil the movie for those who haven't viewed it, but be prepared that this isn't the Illiad by Homer.Overall, if you're interested, you should see it. You won't regret viewing it, but I doubt it'll be on too many people's top ten lists. It certainly could have been with a better actor for Achilles and following Homer's thoughts a little closer.",6,2,12,10 May 2005
The Mummy Returns," Fluff Sequel
","The Mummy Returns is a quick fluff action piece with some poor slapstick comedy. It uses numerous Deus Ex Machina for the sake of using them. One might feel there's the use of retconning here too, but again, even those were completely out of place.It is pretty much a family movie (far more so than the first one) but some young children could be scared by the mummies. For the most part it is upbeat and doesn't ever give you the feeling that anything will go wrong.Synopsis: Bad guy comes back to beat another bad guy to rule the world and the good guys try to stop them all. Most of the characters do a lot of traveling and then have a showdown. Mixed in is some chumming of the good guys that leads no where. Plus they add fate/destiny stuff just to make sure we don't get any more sequels.It assumes the audience has attachment to the characters and assumes you feel the good guys are a tight group but never really builds that up. It's hard to tell if the movie was just poorly made, or if there was really a much grander and broader story that had to be cut down to a couple hours.The acting is okay except for Patricia Velasquez who seemed wooden, but that might have been the directing and not her. She was quite sexy, so it balances out. Rachel Weisz was far sexier in this movie than the first, and the rest of the cast does okay; certainly Brendan Fraser is very comfortable in his role as Richard 'Rick' O'Connell.If you watch it right after the first movie, you'll notice clearly that the CGI is a lot worse in returns. This adds to the idea that it was just a poorly written movie to cash in on the first movie's success. Besides the poor CGI, the action sequences really are quite well done. They're easy to follow, are fast paced, and include more dynamics than the rest of the movie.This is a different movie than the first one. It's less Indiana Jones and more.... well think of a bad kids movie that's supposed to be an adventure but seems silly.It really doesn't feel like it meshes with the first movie (especially the love between Anck Su Namun and Imhotep), and while it introduces the Scorpion King idea, it again doesn't mesh with that movie at all. Unfortunately I think it ended this franchise when it really should have spring-boarded a series of movies had it been done with more thought.With all of that said, ultimately it is a fun movie if you don't care about verisimilitude and as I said, most people would see it as fun for the whole family. It just lacks depth, solid writing, directing, and decent CGI. If you can snag it cheap, you'll feel like you got your money's worth. It isn't one of those movies where you just feel cheated for your time. It's okay, fluffy fun; just turn off your brain first.",4,3,7,15 January 2008
Moon," Outer Limits
","What should have been an episode of The Outer Limits (even then it would take some work to flesh out enough plot) has been fluffed to a feature length movie. Remove an hour in the middle and you won't miss a beat.The script does not realize any of the potential the suitable acting and solid concept contributed. It's worth seeing late one sleepy night but there's nothing thought provoking or even mildly interesting served to the viewer.One scoop of vanilla coming up with a few flakes of absurdity. It may not feel like a waste of your time, but it also won't feel like you spent your time on worthy entertainment.",3,1,6,1 December 2015
