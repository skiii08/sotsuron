Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Post Sequels Perspective
","Went back and watched this after watching the Sequel trilogy to see how they compare. Conclusion? This is not a good movie. If it weren't for Qui-Gon, Darth Maul, and pod racing this would be an atrocious movie.But it stands out against the sequels because it is actually *trying* to be something new and tell a new story. It actually has a vision. It expands on the universe by showing an entirely different world than the original trilogy. It adds the Republic, the Jedi Council, Midi-chlorians, pod racing, new star fighters, gungans (for better or for worse). What did the sequels add? TFA was largely just a remake of A New Hope. The First Order is no different from The Empire. X/A/Y Wings look almost exactly like X/A/Y Wings. Disney tacked a new shape on the side of TIE fighters every couple of movies and called it a dayThis is a not good movie, but Rise of Skywalker was a pointless movie. At this point I don't know which is worse.",5,5,6,6 January 2020
The Prestige," After like the 8th viewing I still love it
","If I watched this for the first time today I may feel differently. But I've loved this movie for a while and after seeing it again I went back and updated from 9 to 10 stars. There are a handful of movies that do not live up to the hype I placed on them when I was younger and when I rewatch a movie I usually expect to come away less excited about it than I was before. But I didn't get that with The Prestige. It has a couple of small imperfections and if you don't buy the Tesla mysticism I can see it being a dud. But I feel it's masterful. The exposition is well executed, the twist isn't cheap, I think the story is both engaging and well told. The story does jump back and forth but I've seen the movie enough to know what's going on.Anyway, I'm still impressed with this movie. Although I do have to turn subtitles on a couple of times to understand what's being said.",10,1,1,4 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," 'I don't know how it happened but it did'
","So begins the movie. Entirely new plot with not much connection to the previous movies, retcon-ing to make it work and fill in missing pieces from TLJ, hamfisted exposition and cringey humor, predictable characters, plenty of things to strain your suspension of disbelief.But it's still Star Wars and that carries much of it, despite basically no character development. They just seem shallow. There are lots of things that made me say 'wait, what' or 'are you serious' but at this point it's really not worth applying even light scrutiny.",6,0,2,22 December 2019
Bird Box," Bad storytelling
","This movie had a lot of potential with such a stacked cast and an interesting premise. But it's just not a well told story. The characters were not well developed and I couldn't bring myself to really care about them. The story jumps around constantly. There's some bad horror-movie-logic with no explaination - I really thought this movie wouldve been better than that.All in all, was hard to care about this movie and it didn't take long before I gave up on it.",5,2,5,15 January 2019
Joker," Loner Murder Fantasy
","When I heard about the fears about the possibility of violence at the opening of this movie, I thought 'there's no way it's actually as much as a wet dream as people think it is.' Welp, it is.Arthur has no redeeming qualities. Taking care of your mom and weirdly bathing her does not a relatable character make. His 'descent in to madness' is shallow because he was there the whole time - his psychosis/hallucinations were not new given that he had already been institutionalized before the events of the movie. Arthur's pain is used to justify his atrocities and with no redeeming qualities it is kind of gross at how many people see him as a 'relatable' character.Turns out the guy who thinks PC culture is ruining comedy still thinks it's funny to make fun of little people. Shocking.If you want better depictions of mental illness then watch Netflix's Maniac or Amazon's Undone.",5,1,1,10 October 2019
