Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," For someone who never liked StarWars...
","I honestly don't think I ever saw any one of the first three StarWars movies all the way through, and if I did I don't remember it...so I guess I am not one of those people who went to see the movie at 12:01am on opening day just because it was StarWars. I had heard that JarJar Binks was somewhat annoying...I didn't find this to be the case.  I had also heard that the little boy who played Anikin Skywalker was a bad act actor and I think he did a very good job. Ewan was wonderful as always, and Liam did a great job.  Everyone did very well. From a non StarWars fanatic, I really think it is worth seeing...especially on the big screen.",9,1,1,19 May 1999
