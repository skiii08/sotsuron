Frost_Nixon," Forces collided
","An enjoyable film that featured two dynamic actors and performances. The slow build-up to the interviews and the retrospectives from different parties make us as an audience eager for the initial showdown. How the interviews finally play out are nothing short of engaging, riveting, and calculating. Langella secured his Oscar nod with a performance ranging from electric and crackling to subdued and humbled. Sheen plays off him when needed and does show a wide range of emotion over the course of the film as you can see how the interviews take their toll on him mentally. Overall, two great performances in a film that I hope gets it's deserved recognition come Award time.",8,0,0,7 August 2010
Iron Man 2," More action, but the script lacked the fun of the original
","A great ride, more heavy on the action and off-color jokes than it's predecessor, but when it's summer sequel time, bigger is always better. Downey is again on the mark with his one-liners, and Rockwell was hilarious as a brown-nosing corporate pig. One main villain (who's not as comparable as recent comic book movie villains) fits his role nicely (Rourke is good at being cocky). However, I will say I though Howard brought more to the character of Rodhes' than Cheadle did, but it hardly matters when the War Machine armor is strapped on. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed the film and all the amazing action sequences it had to offer.",Null,0,1,7 August 2010
Public Enemies," Well-made, with Depp at his subdued best
","A worthwhile tale of a notorious, but charming killer. Depp plays this role as smoothly and care-free as most of his performances, while Bale is comfortable in his role as the straight-and-narrow lawman trying to take down his target. The movie, albeit a bit long, goes at a smooth pace until the careful direction of Mann, who rarely misses a step in his films. A robust cast of characters play their respective roles effectively, but the highlight is Depp who commands the screen whenever he's on it. Although it's light on development of the actual robberies, it's deep with regards to the planning of capturing Depp's character, which shows you how serious the police were with regards to this Public Enemy.",7,0,0,7 August 2010
Orphan," Esther's unique problem makes for a great film.
","There was something wrong with Esther, and that something is pretty interesting as far as plot twists go. Pretty effective psycho kid flick, with a young lady (Isabelle Fuhrman) giving an exceptional performance as a little girl with a big secret. The only blemishes is the standard plot clich√©s that sometimes make you pull your hair out (certain people don't believe the kid is evil, put their heads in the sand, don't want to see the obvious etc....) It's sometimes silly that most movies of this genre have to follow this predictable line, but I guess it's a necessary evil. Regardless, the movie rests on the shoulders of girl power (Farmiga and Fuhrman) who are, again, both very strong in their roles.",8,1,2,7 August 2010
Shutter Island," Another one of Leo's psychedelic journeys
","Will definitely be in most people's top 10 list when the year is up, I know it's in mine. Mesmerizing from start to finish, with the brilliant Scorsese sprinkling in false truths and red herrings along the way. DiCaprio is once again solid as a U.S Marshal who's seemingly losing his mind. The supporting cast is subdue, but effective. What really got me was the way Scorsese is able to keep you on edge even when you're seemingly unaware, with lingering and extended shots, quick camera cuts, and freeze frames.It keeps you on your toes from the get-go and you are eager to see the plot unravel itself, and it does so in outstanding fashion. Revelations are made, and more importantly, it will have you questioning it as soon as it's concluded. In a nutshell, a brilliant film.",9,0,2,7 August 2010
Salt," Angelica's star vehicle
","Angelina proves once again she can kick ass and looking great doing it. The plot kicks off almost immediately and leaves little to the imagination, save for the word of a Russian outcast and the subsequent knee-jerk reaction from Salt and the US government.After that, we're led on some really defy-defying chases through highways and rooftops. Jolie's character is so complex it does truly live up to the tagline floating around for months. The twists and re-twists are interesting to say the least, along there is sometimes a case of one too many, but the cast makes it work. The two supporting members, Ejofor and Schreiber, are very good at playing the eccentric and the straight and narrow, respectively. The direction is fine, as it moves at a brisk pace while sprinkling more facts and secrets while unraveling Salt's past. Overall, this is a good vehicle for Jolie and she makes the most of it.BTW, what's up with giving the (mostly good) Andre Braugher like 2 lines? He must've really need a paycheck.",7,9,18,7 August 2010
Kick-Ass," Pulls no punches. A worthy adaptation
","A truly daring comic-book movie, with great action sequences and dialogue that's sure to shock and leave you in awe. It's customary to hear profanities from adults in films, but hearing it from children always throws you for a loop. Nothing wrong with it in my view, and the constant use of it by Hit-Girl was a funny story in itself. She and Big Daddy definitely made for a great team, and provided some of the film's best moments. No doubt she's the star of the film, as her scenes are pretty much brilliant. Not familiar with the comic book, but as a stand-alone film, it's great. So, as far as an adaptation goes, I'm pretty sure it lives up to the source material.",9,3,8,7 August 2010
The Dark Knight," The benchmark for comic book films
","The superhero film by which all should be measured from now until another one beats it. As close to 'perfect' a film as you will see this year. Drama, action, romance, brutality, emotion, sacrifice. Every element comes together with such cohesiveness it's staggering. Nolan has brought us a crime and superhero epic, with Ledger's Joker no doubt going down in villain film history. An Oscar Nod and hopefully a win for Heath are not far off. Bale's Batman is conflicted, torn, and cautious, with almost scene being directly or indirectly about him, while Eckhart's Dent gives the film it's core by having him metamorphosed before our eyes after a city and it's people don't step up.Ledger's Joker is obviously a menacing presence, and Heath brings such a frightening aura to him that every time he's on screen, you have to sit up and take notice. Overall, a fantastic film I can't recommend enough. Well worthy of the box-office records.",10,2,6,7 August 2010
Avatar," A visual feast, but the script lacks neutrality
","Fantastic for what it truly is, a visual spectacle. I give Cameron credit for showing us wonderful imagery and lifelike humanoid beings. What I don't give him credit for is the lousy and heavy-handed script and dialogue that seems to pound you over the head repeatedly with it's 'evil big-wig' message. We get it, we're bad, they're good. This is all punctuated by one annoying character so I had to cringe whenever they talked. Regardless, it's simply a masterpiece for imagery in terms of the scope and grandeur. But I hope Cameron tones down his 'message' for the sequel and just focus on the internal Pandora conflict, which will make for fantastic story-telling.",8,1,2,7 August 2010
Zombieland," More fun than you'd think
","Funny tongue-in-cheek comedy about a world overrun by zombies. The 'rules' alone are enough to make you smile and realize you're in for an interesting ride. The cast (as small as they were) are good and the fact that it's a movie with few characters, it allows the story to move at a brisk pace all while allowing for just enough character development to make you care for them. Woody was particular funny with his zany, eccentric, and pretty much crazy character. Over-the-top gore will derail some, but those who stick with it (and it's pretty much over before you know it) will enjoy the time they spent with 4 very interesting characters.",7,0,1,7 August 2010
The Wrestler," Rourke's tour-de-force.
","Even though I don't believe Rourke is the best actor of the year, this is certainly a great performance as a battered, bruised, and conflicted pro wrestler. Wrestling fans will like all the little touches that lend to it's authenticity. As for the character of Robinson, he goes through the gauntlet of emotions ranging from rejection, revival, slight redemption, then ultimately acceptance. Kudos go out to Tomei and Wood, who bring in powerful performances when it counts. Also, kudos to Aronofsky (robbed of an Oscar nod) for his intimate and very personal form of directing, which brings us up close and personal almost throughout. The camera is usually zoned in on the back, giving us an over-the-shoulder view that I believe keeps the audience involved. Overall, a very good film that unfortunately has to be somber throughout.",Null,0,0,7 August 2010
Inception," Pure Brilliance
","Make no mistake: this is the best film of 2010. Notice I don't say 'so far', because it will be extremely tough to top everything this movie does right. Nolan is a good story-teller, dating way back to his 'Memento' days. However, with this film, he cements his status as a superb writer. What could've been a Lynch-esquire blob of confusion about dreams and alternate realities, Nolan effortlessly weaves his time line and narrative so that most viewers can understand it with a first viewing. The cast is superb (Leo is subdue when he has to be and raging when it's needed) as our protagonist and the Extractor and Tom Hardy is a real standout as the Forger. It was also great to see Cotillard have a part unlike her past roles, that of an intruder and overall gnat for this 'Dream Team'. The plot is high-concept and high-class, but it never plays down to you or make you feel inferior. It's really centered on entering the mind of one man to force him to make a unique decision. But within that mind, there lies dreamscapes and locales weaved from the collective minds of our team, and they delve layer by layer into the unknown. It's ambitious, it's risky, and it's brilliant.With dream movies, the limit is your imagination so you need spectacular set pieces and effects to help it come to life. Inception was no exception. Fantastic visuals and gorgeous locales lit up the screen. Of course, with great visuals, you need great music to complement it. Hans Zimmer has outdone himself, providing a pounding and haunting score which is, again, probably the best soundtrack of the year. And, finally, there's the ending.After the brilliance we're exposed to, we're given with an ending that left my theater with a collective 'sigh', 'awww!', and 'Come On!' When you can illicit a response like that, you know you've made either a really good or really bad movie. Fortunately for Inception, it's the former. Maybe the ending's what you make it. Nolan may have just left it up to you, or maybe a second viewing will uncover something that was missed. Regardless, it's a great way to end a great movie.",10,3,8,7 August 2010
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," The best chapter in the 'Saga'
","This saga of vampire movies finally realizes it's potential in the hands of Slade as Eclipse is truly good in it's own right. It's still got the love triangle, it still has some groan inducing dialogue (sprinkled in with some light hearted moments), but what's gone is the doom, gloom, and downright depression that plagued all of 'New Moon'. We've got a marriage on the way, but a group of new-bloods threaten to take over a city. However, we've got alliances that are forged and pacts that are made.I really can't single out any actor or actress since they are all average at best, but collectively, the ensemble cast works fine. I actually did enjoy Dakota Fanning and her legion, who basically looked on ominously in the distance, waiting for their a reason to strike. This bodes well for Breaking Dawn, which I hope puts the series out with a bang, because Eclipse sure set the stage for it.",6,0,6,7 August 2010
Up in the Air," Fresh, not Stale
","Clooney tones it down for this exceptionally well-made film geared towards an issue many of us have experienced or soon will. Putting to the side the nature of the main character's work, he's taken on a whirlwind ride with a equally vivacious female (the wonderful Vera Farmiga). What matures from that is a slew of emotions, revelations, and finally head-on heartache. The film flows effortlessly, and with something interesting on screen at all times, it's never dull. I'll also give kudos to Ashley Greene playing a rookie exec who's quite confident, but she soons learns that work-life balance takes it's toll. Interesting characters and a modern plot spearhead one of the best movies of last year.",9,0,2,7 August 2010
