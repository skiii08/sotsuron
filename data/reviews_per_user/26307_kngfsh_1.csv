Catch Me If You Can," I enjoyed my 2+ hours in my top row seat.
",My husband and I just returned from watching 'Catch Me If You Can' and we enjoyed it very much. We go at least once a week to the Movies to escape our everyday lives. This was another great adventure. It did start a bit slow but was well worth the time we spent on our New Years' Day 'date'. The mixture of humor and seriousness was enjoyed by all in the theater. It was good to see Leo back after the last (The Beach) disapointment. Can't wait to catch 'Gangs' this weekend.,9,1,2,1 January 2003
