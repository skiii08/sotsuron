3:10 to Yuma," Passable entertainment riddled with problems
","The assumption seems to be made too often nowadays that the western was 'killed', if not by the Spaghetti western boom, and if not by expensive 1980s failures such as 'Heaven's Gate', by Clint Eastwood's 'Unforgiven' in 1994, with its grimy town, unpleasant/flawed/complex characters, and relentlessly downbeat myth-busting. Not only this, but it needs to be 'reborn', and critics seem to arguing that '3:10 to Yuma' is the film to do that. At first glance, a strange movie to fulfil this mission - it's yet another Hollywood remake, though thankfully not of an absolute standout like 'High Noon'; instead, Delmer Dave's minor classic from 1957, a tense, taut little film focusing as much on characterisation and psychological drama as on gun play, which ratchets up the suspense in a way clearly influenced by 'High Noon'. At second glance, how this film could rebirth anything is a mystery. Everyone's praising the performances, from Russel Crowe as the murderous/thoughtful/charming/witty gang leader to Christian Bale as the fallen-on-hard-times/war veteran/family man/rancher who has to put him on the train to Yuma prison to Ben Foster as Crowe's psychotic, blue-eyed lieutenant (interestingly, one review I've read elsewhere suggests that Foster tries to suggest a homo-erotic edge to his character's relationship with Crowe, but Crowe's interpretation of his own role shuts this avenue off). True enough, they're good, as would be expected - but nowadays, I'm beginning to feel that a lot of 'good performances' are given not so much in service to the story and the film as to ensure an Oscar nod - cynical, I know, but it's a feeling I just can't shake off.A major flaw is apparent in the inconsistencies that riddle the film, inconsistencies that, in a movie which is attempting to be a psychological drama as well as an action movie, strike a particularly jarring note. For instance, why does Crowe's apparently cold-blooded, ruthlessly efficient killer return to the posse, including an injured Bale, an incompetent doctor and a 14-year old boy, having just killed 3 Indians, when he could have easily got away? Why does he help Bale in the final shoot-out, when he could easily push him into the line of fire or slip round a corner and leave Bale at the gang's mercy? And finally, why does he shoot 6 gang members (in a feat of gunsmanship far more unbelievable than Clint Eastwood's in the Dollars films, or the climax to Unforgiven) when they've rescued him? Then put himself back on the prison train to Yuma...then whistle for his horse? Dude, where's the logic? And I'm not even going to start on Peter Fonda's impossibly leathery, tough old bounty hunter, who seems to be impervious to close-range stomach wounds...What's more, as well as these serious motivational and plot inaccuracies and anomalies, there are wildly over-the-top action sequences which jar with an attempt in other parts of the film to present a more 'realistic' version of the 'Wild West,' the climactic gunfight being the worst offender, closely followed by a horseback chase through a mine.Anyway, let's go back to the assumption that the western is dead. I don't see why: of all genres, it has always seemed to me to be particularly rich, offering numerous opportunities for explorations of themes relating to masculinity, civilisation, violence, crime, the relationship of individual to community, the imposition of values in a lawless country, the development of a problematic, rough-and-ready approach to justice and morality arising out of physical necessity...etc. What's more, many of these ideas are relevant to today, as 'The Proposition' (which I think we can characterise as a western, despite the Australian setting) showed, with its exploration of colonialism. To be sure, '3:10' touches on some of these ideas. The trouble is, it touches on them in a very obvious, crude, non-naturalistic way, through dialogue that is almost psychobabble; the film-makers don't seem to have learned the lessons of old westerns which would have for blunter, less well-expressed, more homespun philosophies. I can think of two examples from Peckinpah: Joel McRea's 'all I want is to enter my house justified' from 'Ride the High Country' (one line expressing so much of the motivation behind the heroes in both Peckinpah's, and other's, westerns), and William Holden's 'let's go' from 'The Wild Bunch' - just two words and a glance before striding out to certain death (which could be walked away from) - the 'a man's gotta do' cliché taken to its furthest extent so that's it's maybe not even a moral decision, more of an existential act of defiance.My main criticism is that this is a conflicted film, striving at once to take the western back to something more traditional, as Kevin Costner's 'Open Range' did, and to accommodate the more excessive touches introduced by the Spaghettis and the more downbeat, 'realistic' touches which were developed to perhaps their fullest extent in 'Unforgiven' (this attempt at 'realism' is quickly subverted by the numerous far-fetched, inconsistent, nonsensical elements). Not sure whether he wants to deliver action-packed box-office Hollywood product with big stars, or a showcase for these two stars to flex their acting muscles and earn some Oscar nominations, or a serious western, Mangold in the end creates a compromise which doesn't fully realise any of these options, despite the critics' almost unanimous praise.",6,1,3,24 September 2007
Lost in Translation," Little more than a 'mood' piece
","It's hard, at first, to fathom why this film is so successful - perhaps it's because people think they've seen a 'meaningful' film - it lacks violence, sex (apart from a brief, off-screen reference and another brief scene in a strip club), swearing, and a clearly delineated plot, unfolding in a leisurely, low-key, melancholy, soporific fashion. So sure, it's not M:I3, but that doesn't automatically make it high art, or even a particularly good film, either. Too often Coppola seems content to let the camera sweep smoothly over night-life shots of Tokyo, or linger over Johanssen and Murray's serious faces, with perhaps some music sweeping over to make one think one's watching something 'meaningful.' (In fact, surprisingly for a woman director, Coppola seems to exploit the (admittedly beautiful) Johanssen somewhat - a long amount of time is spent in which the camera gazes on her, often partially clothed (though not nude or bare-breasted), and I was particularly troubled by the opening shot of her behind, which seems to have very little to do with the rest of the film apart from offering titillation for the audience.) The dialogue, which could have saved the movie, often fails to live up to expectations - the central scene, mentioned by another reviewer, where Murray and Johanssen are lying next to each other on the bed, and he gives her his thoughts on life, is quite touching, but he doesn't end up saying anything of much significance, just some bland generalisations about life/experience, and we never really get too many character insights. It's too elusive, too much concerned with surface, despite the fact that so many of its fans praise it for going deeper than most blockbusters. At times I felt I was watching an extended commercial, of the kind that seem prevalent nowadays - seductive visual images with meditative music transposed over the top, calming in a new age meditation kind of a way, but ultimately not saying much.Here's a brief summary of the movie: Johanssen is bored and lonely in Tokyo because her husband (a photographer) is away all the time and thinks she is a snob. She's not sure what to do with her life after completing her philosophy degree at Yale, and wanders around the city, aimlessly searching for meaning. Murray is a washed-up film star doing whiskey commercials in Japan for a week. His phone conversations with his wife reveal a seemingly warm relationship, though as the film continues it becomes clear that he's going through something of a mid-life crisis; she's wrapped up in the kids and the trappings of domesticity (seen in the faxes she sends through about shelves and carpets), he's almost not needed, and life has lost some of its spark. Fairly predictably, he tries to rekindle with Johanssen, though - thank God - platonically. (In fact, this was one of the best aspects of the film - it resisted the temptation to become a romantic drama and instead enabled a slightly more perceptive look at human relationships in general. Probably the falsest part of the film was when Murray slept with another woman - it felt contrived and added little to plot or atmosphere.) In the end, though, he has to return to his family, Johanssen has to continue her search for meaning alone, and Murray's biggest act of rebellion is telling his wife he wants to start eating Japanese food. The problem is, they feel so aimless anyway that it's hard to feel too much sympathy for them - they're rich, with access to facilities which millions across the world could only dream of, and both have loving (if perhaps distanced) spouses - it could be argued that Coppola's analysing the emptiness at the heart of modern society, despite its wealth and power, but because the film is so elusive, it never really manages to summon itself up to SAY something - though it gives the impression that the viewer has been through something meaningful. Another problem is the treatment of the Japanese, which, as several other reviewers have noted, rarely rises beyond fairly cheap comical stereotyping - a far more potent analysis of the lack of understanding between cultures and the barriers constructed by language and custom could have been undertaken which would have added a whole layer of meaning to the film that, as it is, is only hinted at (as much by the title as anything).There were many ideas, themes and threads only hinted at in the film, which, if developed further, could have ensured the experience that so many seem to think this already is. As with much contemporary artistic product, I feel that people are quick to praise LIT as wonderful because it so much as touches on deeper themes, whether or not it fully realises them or develops them in a convincing way. What should really be the benchmark should be art that actually succeeds in not just suggesting ideas beyond the vapidity of the mainstream, but carries them through and causes us, for example, to take a fresh look at the familiar (as opposed to us just leaving the cinema and saying 'how beautiful, how thought-provoking, how ARTISTIC, it must be a masterpiece').",6,80,120,16 April 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," Whoosh! Bang! Crash! Wallop!
","What's become a spy-film franchise big enough to be compared to the Bond series (there's a link on the Orange homepage asking 'who's better: Bourne or Bond'?) is now onto its third film. For those who, like me, found 'The Bourne Supremacy' an inferior film to 'The Bourne Identity' (mangled and meandering plot; the lack of surprise and sense of mystery that the first film had; Paul Greengrass' frantic direction, suited to gritty documentaries like 'Bloody Sunday', but maybe not to a Hollywood action film), the good news is that 'Ultimatum' is a better film, though still not as good as the first. Greengrass' zingy, constantly-moving camera-work, deployed to add a 'gritty' edge to the fight scenes in 'Supremacy', is again present, though here it seems to be used often as not to cover up improbabilities such as Bourne jumping, superhero-style, improbably long distances from roof to roof. Damon remains tight-lipped and pretty much expressionless throughout, playing the role of assassin to perfection but skimping on the softer, vulnerable side that would allow us some emotional engagement with him which is rather lacking in the film (something brought out more in his relationship with Franka Potente's character in the first film and the beginning of the second). It's pretty much action all the way - one long adrenaline trip, frequently driven by John Powell's insistent repeated theme in the orchestral score. To accommodate this, the plot is stripped down and simple (basically: Bourne goes after baddies; Bourne fights baddies; Bourne goes after more baddies in search of who he really/originally was, and how he became the assassin Jason Bourne). There are numerous set-pieces: dodging a shooter in Waterloo station; scooter and roof-top chase in Tangier (the most extended, and perhaps the best, of all of them); and finally, climactic action in New York. Also, you got appearances by good, respected actors: David Strathairn, the mellifluous voice intact from 'Good Night and Good Luck', but the role very different; Scott Glenn; Joan Allen; Julia Stiles (thankfully not turning into the love interest here, though playing a fairly major role); and, to trump them all, Albert Finney, who really doesn't have that much to do but provides a suitably serious cameo. In the end, you may wonder whether it adds up to more than the sum of parts - the answer is probably no, but it's an entertaining enough summer blockbuster and it'll keep you suitably occupied for a couple of hours in the cinema.",7,3,6,18 August 2007
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Interesting but flawed
","It's hard to imagine this film being much of a success, despite starring Brad Pitt. It's a long-haul: slow-moving, intensely melancholic and sombre, dealing in grey-paletted landscapes and skyscapes, pauses, silences, things unsaid as much as things said. Still, it's been critically successful, and it address questions pertinent to today's society. Fame. Hero worship. The desire to be someone else, as an escape from the drudgery of your own life ('do you want to be like me, or do you want to be me?'). The realisation that that someone else is 'just a man,' just like you, and that he perhaps struggles with the same sense of drudgery and hopelessness, as you do. Notably, the film conveys a sense of the drudgery and sheer hardship of life in the west that many films miss, and, unlike most other westerns (with the exception of 'True Grit'), the dialogue often feels authentic  slightly grandiose, perhaps stilted to our ears  almost Elizabethan; slow, deliberate, unusual, and just right. Roger Ebert comments on the bleak emptiness of the landscape (like McCabe and Mrs Miller, it was shot in Canada- all huge grey skies, desolate waving wheat-fields, snow, ice, and mud), and how, because of this, because 'the land is so empty, it creates a vacuum demanding men to become legends.' As in the Russian drama 'The Return', the landscape becomes almost a character, or at least a driving force which partially dictates why the characters behave how they do and what courses of action they take.I say this partly because no explanation is sought, or offered, by anyone in the film, for the gang's actions. This is simply what they do - perhaps to avoid the drudgery of working in a grocery store, like Bob, or making shoes, as Frank suggests he will do; perhaps for the money, to give themselves a chance of a fuller life. Perhaps simply because, in this environment, doing anything feels almost like a random act. The film is detached from the characters, and the characters are detached from themselves. At one point, Jesse speaks about watching himself from outside: 'I look at my red hands and my mean face... and I wonder 'bout that man that's gone so wrong.' The state governor comments that, while some say Jesse's crimes are revenge on Republicans and people who wronged his family, his victims didn't seem to be chosen on account of their political persuasion. In other words, he's no political rebel. He's just an outlaw, who does what he does - who knows why? That's not important to the governor. He wants the man captured, not to understand his motivation. The film should go beyond his concerns though, and examine the latter..shouldn't't it? Doesn't it?I'm not convinced that it does, and more context of the sort hinted at in the governor's two or three lines might have helped. For all the film's desire for historical accuracy in detail, in the bigger picture it's rather sketchy. I'll return to these criticisms later. But, still, it's a film easy to admire, for several reasons: the use of space, and silence, building tension in long, drawn-out dinner-table conversations. The inexorable build toward death, like Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in the West', a dance of death - or a slow, deliberately paced walk towards it. It feels like something winding down: everyone is aware of impending confrontation, but unable to escape from it. People face their deaths with stoicism, as if this is what fate has dictated for them, as if it is their role to play: the gang member Pitt shoots in the back for real, or imagined betrayal; James himself, who glimpses his assassin in a mirror but makes no attempt to dodge the bullet's path.It will probably be admired most for its performances: Casey Affleck's insinuating, awkward hero-worshipper, at once understandable and pitiable - bullied, insecure, unloved - and at once somewhat contemptible, annoying and disturbing. Pitt's James - aloof, detached: melancholy, for no clear reason, at one point he hints at his desire for death, for suicide. 'Once you've looked over the other side, you'll never want to go back into your body,' he says. Or something of the sort. Then shoots holes into the ice.Ultimately however, despite this admiration, it's hard to like, much less love. It is characterised by the same aloofness I've just discussed in its protagonist. Jesse's occasional mentions of the soul raise the possibility of a deeper philosophical strain (which might be somewhat out of place, given the dour 'factual', 'realistic' nature of the film, such as the vomit that smears Bob Ford's suit when he falls over on a saloon floor)- but it remains merely a suggestion, adding to a vague impression of some sort of inexplicable sadness. Of course, James is not simple: a psychotic family man. But there's a lack of insight into his character, and the other characters in the film. They seem to remain ciphers who simply exist, rather than fully fledged human beings who act. James' family seems barely to exist, except for occasional shots to show that he has one. The film observes dislikeable characters doing dislikable things; the audience is left to judge, but are not given that much to base their judgements on, despite the slow pace. The film's attitude to its legendary titular character is unclear: do we admire him? He's a cold-blooded murderer - surely just as much of a coward as Bob Ford. Or is he let off the hook because he's Brad Pitt, because he's brooding and handsome and has a family? Ultimately, the film is indifferent - neither tragic nor exciting, just generally glum, it gives the impression of saying more than it actually does. It had the potential to be more than it is, and is thus an interesting, perhaps necessary, but flawed movie.",6,31,47,5 January 2008
The Departed," Good film, lacks a certain something though...
","A remake of the 2002 Hong-Kong film 'Infernal Affairs', this will inevitably be remembered as 'the film that got Scorsese his Oscar', rather than on its own merits. Nevertheless, it's still a good movie, entertaining and with an excellent plot. Jack Nicholson overacts with his familiar anarchic streak, a mad glint in his eyes, mixed in with an occasional hint of cold-blooded menace. Hardly a believable turn, but good fun nonetheless. Leonardo da Caprio is all tortured angst, and very good at it too (the beard helps, making him look about 10 years older). Matt Damon is less convincing - he's made more sympathetic the 'Infernal Affairs' character, and, well, he's just too much of a 'good guy'...Maybe I only say that because I saw the 'Bourne Ultimatum' recently. Mark Whalberg's smaller role is well done; Martin Sheen doesn't really have much to do.Having seen 'Infernal Affairs' first, I was inevitably going to compare this to it this 'remake'. The plot is pretty similar, but it's been 'Scorsese-fied' - you could argue that it's as much down to the screenplay as the direction, but perhaps the screenplay was influenced by a perception of Scorsese as 'auteur', so tailored towards his preoccupations and styles. Who knows, I'm ignorant of the collaborative (or otherwise) process that went into the making of this film, I'm just speculating. Let me clarify what I mean by 'Scorsese-fied': stuffed full of language (c word, f word liberally splashed through it), sexual references, references to the church, lashings of bloody violence (everytime someone's killed - a major character, anyway - they invariably end up lying on the floor in a big pool of blood. What is it with Scorsese and pools of blood? End of Taxi Driver, the bounty hunter character in Cape Fear, blah blah.) Although Infernal Affairs was unsubtle in several respects (it had a big streak of sentimentality running through it which, from my limited experience, seems to be a characteristic of some of Oriental films), it in a way made something more interesting, 'deeper' out of the story. THere it was connected to Buddhist notions of the cyclical nature of life - there was a quote from a Buddhist text at the beginning of the film, and this cyclical thing was pretty obvious throughout (and even more so if you watch the IA sequels). So we were left in no doubt that the cycle would go on - even if the protagonists died, others would take their place, and the game between cop and criminal would continue, as would the killings. That wasn't stressed nearly as much in 'Departed', particularly with the ending, where Damon's character pops it (rather a ham-fisted touch, I felt, particularly when the camera swept up from his body to a shot of a rat in the window, in front of the view that we saw Damon looking at several times in the film, the view that represented his conflicted desires to be both cop and criminal, or whatever it symbolised).Another thing 'Departed' lacked was the fascinating relationship between head cop and head criminal, a mixture of friendliness and hatred. Sheen was a peripheral figure, and it's hard to imagine Costello, as played by Nicholson, having a particularly complex relationship with any other character: too cartoonish and OTT for that. His death at the hands of Damon (a cold-blooded murder in the original) becomes an emotional reaction to Nicholson's desire for him to be a son-figure, which comes out of the blue and, well, just doesn't convince.What is Scorsese's intention with this remake, then? Is he trying to simplify it into just another cops and robbers/gangster movie? Is he trying to do a 'Heat' and show that there's little difference between those on the right and those on the wrong side of the law? (There is a line somewhere which makes this point - Costello: 'When you decide to be something, you can be it. That's what they don't tell you in the church. When I was your age they would say we can become cops, or criminals. Today, what I'm saying to you is this: when you're facing a loaded gun, what's the difference?'). Maybe he's just addressing his familiar preoccupations with male violence, repressed Catholic guilt, sexuality (not such a big part of this film, though there is a scene in a porn theatre), hints of racism ('Twenty years after an Irishman couldn't get a f*cking job, we had the presidency. May he rest in peace. That's what the n*ggers don't realize. If I got one thing against the black chappies, it's this - no one gives it to you. You have to take it') - though to be fair, for once, there is a black character in the film who does more than get shot or appear on a street. The opening voice-over raises the familiar church/criminal options, the desire to amount to something rather than be just another poor person in the city, mixed in with the desire to belong to a close-knit community, to feel like you belong: i.e. the criminal fraternity (a big part of 'Goodfellas') - 'I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me. Years ago we had the church. That was only a way of saying - we had each other. The Knights of Columbus were real head-breakers; true guineas. They took over their piece of the city.' But these themes aren't really addressed or expanded on as the movie continues, as we instead get to see Nicholson chomp on the scenery, often in a way that's played for gruesome laughs. There's just a feeling that something's missing - fine though this film is, it's not Oscar-worthy: my theory is that it only won at the Academy Awards because the academy feel guilty for short-changing Scorsese back in the years when he made acclaimed, ground-breaking movies. But it's not bad; not bad at all.",7,0,1,21 September 2007
