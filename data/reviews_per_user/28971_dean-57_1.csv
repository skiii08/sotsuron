The Blair Witch Project," P.T. Barnum presents the Emperor's New Clothes
","Don't believe the hype.  Even if you allow that the film makers and actors are a talented group, their 'film' is a failure. Their goal was to create an amateurish looking student film and that is exactly what they did. Unfortunately the successful creation of 'found' footage does not make for compelling viewing. No suspense. No fear. No nausea. Only boredom. The last shot, not scene, just shot, is great. But not worth the wait. Save your money.",1,0,2,24 August 1999
