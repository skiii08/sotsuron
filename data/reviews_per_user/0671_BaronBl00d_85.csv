Gremlins," Home for the Holidays Gremlin-Style
","This movie made a big impact on me as a younger man for I really had not seen anything like it beforehand. Hoyt Axton plays a father who is an inventor cruising through Chinatown in search of just that special gift for his son. He is taken to a small, out-of-the-way 'junk' shop where Axton sees this adorable creature who sings, smiles, and is just damned cute. The proprietor, an elderly Chinese man, tells Axton that this creature is not for sale, but the young boy who brought him there sells Axton the creature unbeknownst to Grandpa. Axton is given three rules that must be observed with the creature: 1). No bright light 2). no water 3). never feed the creature after midnight(okay, this rule is loopy). This takes place in the first five minutes or so of the film. The rest of the film is the son getting what he will call Gizmo and what happens when these rules are inevitably broken. The scenic backdrops to the small town are quaint, surrealistic, and nostalgic. Director Joe Dante always infuses his pictures with nostalgic qualities whether it is a scene we may have seen over and over again, character types, and my favorite are the actors of older films that older(or more rehearsed audience members) will quickly identify which will undoubtedly be lost on younger viewers and certainly viewers of today by large part. We get Key Luke as the Chinese shop owner. He was most famous for his roles as Number 1 Son in the old Charlie Chan films. How about Dick Miller as Mr. Futterman - a staple in Roger Corman films. Miller's costar in Little Shop of Horrors Jackie Joseph plays his wife in this. Edward Andrews - the old, reliable character actor - plays a bank manager. William Schallert plays a minister. You can also see Polly Holliday(Flo from Alice) play a devilishly wicked Mr. Potter-type. Kenneth Tobey has a cameo as does Chuck Jones and several others. The lead actors are young but entertaining. Zach Galligan was 19 when he made this - his first feature. He does a decent job. Phoebe Cates is also rather good and very lovely. The real star though is the puppet Gizmo and the gremlins themselves. Dante did all this in an old-school manner. No CGI here - thankfully. This is real filmmaking the way real filmmaking used be done. It was labor and time intensive and rather costly but Dante does a lot here with a spartan budget. Produced by Steven Spielberg Gremlins shows what some intelligent-minded people can put together with creativity and vision. There are so many scenes that stick out with me: the movie theater, the battle with the Christmas tree, the microwave scene, and many others including Mrs. Deagle's spiraling exit. All are outstanding. In the end, however; it is the little moments that I like best like the small character parts, Dick Miller going on about foreign products, and Gizmo playing a small piano-like instrument. Gremlins is now 20 years old - I saw it in the movie theater when it came out - and it has withstood the test of time rather well. I believe in another 20 years it will still be able to say the same thing. By the way who doesn't love that music?",9,1,2,26 December 2010
The Incredible Hulk," Undeniably Better than the Hulk from 2003 BUT...
","...it wasn't great either. Sure it is well-made, competently directed, even well-cast. Edward Norton, in my opinion, makes a very credible Bruce Banner. Liv Tyler is gorgeous and CAN act. William Hurt and Tim Roth are slices of ham so thick that I thought the film's waist would explode from indigestion! Yet, both retain one's interest. The movie is much more faster paced than the Ang lee film. The CGI effects are much better as well. Look, this was a pretty decent film overall. Despite the new cast and director, the movie was a lot like the Ang Lee film. Some of the scenes were almost the same which when you look at this film director's work - we are now talking about Louis LeTerrier - he seems to do cinematic do-overs more often than not(he also directed the new Clash of the Titans!). That being said - the new film offers what the audiences wanted - an updated version to replace what many saw as a travesty. Now, we have it. This was a necessary step in getting us to The Avengers.",6,0,0,27 October 2012
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Well-Done Prequel
","Star Wars: The Phantom Menace is a flawed, fun film that begins the trilogy leading up to the story found in the 1977 blockbuster film Star Wars. George Lucas once again writes and directs and produces and his talent in all three areas is evident. Without re-hashing the plot(for which the volumes of previous reviews can do), Lucas uses some of the elements from his earlier three films and expands on them in this film. The tie-in for me seemed seamless and a perfect fit, at least in the story. We get a young Anikhan Skywalker(Darth Vader) here, Obi-Ben, C-3PO, R2D2, Yoda, and even Jabba the Hut. And also the man who will become the evil, insidious Emperor. We get new characters as well. Some work very nicely(the queen and Quagon(?)), while others are not quite as effective. Jar-Jar Binks is the film's comic relief, and though he has moments of amusement - he also takes some credibility away from the serious nature and believability of the story. Lucas also relies way too heavily on CGI effects. It seems virtually everything is computer generated. But these for me are small criticisms. Overall, I really enjoyed The Phantom Menace. It has a pretty good story, some solid acting performances(Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor doing a nice Alec Guiness, Ian McDiarmind, Natalie Portman, and the young boy playing little boy Darth), some exciting, visually stunning special effects, and just lots of entertainment bang for your entertainment buck.",6,0,3,27 May 2005
Ghost," I Liked It!
","I waited a LONG time to finally see this. I was expecting a schmaltzy love story - and got it BUT got a good deal more too. Just about everyone knows the story of Sam and Molly. I also knew I would have to sit through the pottery scene - fortunately it was early on. I also knew Whoopi Goldberg was in it and won her Oscar. Let's start with her. She deserved it. She was very funny, energetic, and breathed comedic life into some pretty pedestrian material at times. She is gorgeous too! The film is definitely a love story, a story of love conquering all, and love transcending death. It is also a story of redemption, good and evil, a murder mystery of sorts, and a comedy of situation at times as well. Add in some not-so-great special effects and we get spirits being asked to rise. Dark spirits whisking people to Hell. A variety of ghosts who seem content to sit around and be funny. At the core of the film, however; is a triangle of acting chemistry. No doubt at all that Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore have it. Their love looks real. Whoopi and Demi have some chemistry as well, but I think the chemistry between Whoopi and Patrick is what really carries the film. They have great timing together. They are funny together. The best parts of the film for me are the scenes where they are together. Swayze has this innocent naivete about him that really is convincing. The writing is wonderful and the direction crisp. The final scene is a tear-jerker that even I could not fail to succumb to in the end. I recommend Ghost heartily.",7,4,6,12 July 2016
The Ring," Modern Horror With Classic Scary Roots
","Don't expect gobs of gore and buckets of blood with The Ring.  Director Gore Verbinski manages to drum up barrels of suspense and creepy moments without all that.  The Ring is a remake of a Japanese horror thriller called Ringu. The story in short details a videocassette that when seen causes one's death within a week.  Although shot almost scene for scene like Ringu for almost the first two-thirds, The Ring combines an innovative story, some solid acting, and some creepy special effects and mysterious music all to great effect.  Naomi Watts stars and does a credible acting job as a mother trying to save herself and her son amidst this terrible REAL urban legend of sorts. The rest of the acting is uniformly good with Brian Cox standing out in a small yet pivotal role(and a role not in Ringu).  Though you won't understand everything at the end, The Ring will provide a whale of a good time giving you some real, honest goose bumps.  It's nice to see a film like this get a lot of support and yet not be trashy in any way.",Null,1,2,15 December 2003
Se7en," Gritty, Disturbing Thriller - One of its Kind
","Incredibly gritty, very fluid, and most disturbing are all ways that one might describe David Fincher's Seven, a film, as all of these reviews on here will attest to, is about a serial killer-maniac killing people based on the seven deadly sins. There is little need to rehash the plot here then but what makes Seven such a good film and one of the best thrillers of the last few decades? 1). Two strong, key performances by Brad Pitt and, in particular, Morgan Freeman as New York police detectives just united as one, Pitt is coming, and the other is about to retire. Freeman and Pitt have some chemistry between them and let's face it - Freeman is just plain good at just about any role he assays. Add to this strong supporting work from Paltrow and R. Lee Ermey and especially Kevein Spacey as the killer. Spacey's voice and looks sent chills down my spine each time he was on screen. 2)David Fincher knows how to direct. This film is gross and really is selling a very seedy product as something more. Fincher makes that happen with the crisp dialog between Freeman and Pitt, the very low lighting effects throughout, the quick pacing of the film, and the depth of characterization that he allows his characters to have. 3) The story is well-conceived, well-written, and just crazy enough to be believable. The film has many scenes which are shocking and designed to be so - they succeed. But behind all that blood and seedy atmosphere lies a chess game between two police detectives - each good at what he does in a different manner - and one crazy but brilliant sociopath killer. The journey they take us on is one scary ride.",9,4,5,2 March 2008
Dawn of the Dead," A Worthy Remake
","Though geared toward action far more than its predecessor, this version of Dawn of the Dead packs a wallop. It is fast-paced, has interesting characters(though far more could have been done in 'fleshing' them out), retains the spirit of the first film, and keeps the tone very serious throughout. Ving Rhames plays a policeman guiding a small group of people into a nearby mall not far from Milwaukee after the NIGHT when the living dead rise. Once there various other people find their way there as well, and much of the film deals with characters having conflicts in the face of adversity, reinforcing the mall, finding life boring after awhile as death waits for them outside the mall, and slowly discovering through trial and error what the new 'disease' is and how it spreads. The group is a pretty eclectic lot: a cop, a jack of all trades guy who was working at Best Buy, three security guards, a punk thief and his pregnant Russian girl, assorted other people that arrive later, and a nurse who is really the film's lead. Much of what we see is through her perspective to a degree. Though the film has a great deal of gore, I didn't find it as bad as the original, nor was the film going for sick laughs as much either as in Romero's film. What it does have that makes it VERY different from Romero's film is the zombies run like Jesse Owens and the disease spreads quickly. Only seconds are needed for a dead corpse to become animated once infected. The fast zombies are nothing new to film having first been done quite successfully in 28 days Later. This film is directed with flair, has more than competent acting(Rhames really excels as a cop coping with loss), and a pace that just doesn't stop. In many ways it is a better film than Romero's, but Romero's film explored the depths of human nature and needs in his film amidst hyperbolic splatter and undead guffaws. His film was in many ways a character study. The original is ultimately the better film, but it has some welcomed competition here. Besides, what greater homage could be bestowed to a film like Romero's Dawn of the Dead than having a remake that is as well-crafted and scary as this film. Personal Preference: I like the slow-moving zombies more. If something like that should ever happen I might see it to another day - for what purpose only God would know!",Null,0,2,6 November 2004
Iron Man 2," Acceptable
","I really enjoyed the first Iron Man. I thought it had a lot of riveting action. Robert Downey Jr. was in top form quipping all about, and the source material seemed to be given a great deal of respect. The sequel is not bad by no means. It has the action, a haggard Robert Downey quipping(but with a lot less zing), beautiful Scarlett Johannson, and a mega-lode of special effects. Perhaps too much in that area for me. What was supposed to be presented on the screen as reality - at least for me - was detracted by the over-use of CGI, explosions, and a throw-it-all-at-you ending. The movie picks up sort of where the first one left off, and, yes, it is laying the groundwork for The Avengers release. Like I said, I didn't dislike the movie but left viewing it somewhat disappointed. Sorry, I cannot help how I feel when watching a film sometimes. Maybe I need to see it again. For now, I liked Johansson(a lot!), Downey at times, and thought Mickey Rourke was okay - liked the Monte Carlo scene best. Kate Mara is aboard and so is Samuel Jackson. Nice to see Gary Shandling has a role. He was humorous - at times.John Slattery does a nice job playing Howard stark in some flashback scenes.",6,1,3,3 November 2012
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Leave it to Beaver(s)
","A truly inventive, oft times breathtaking journey into the fertile mind of C. S. Lewis. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is refreshing; it tells a 'simple' story in a simple manner yet is anything but simple. Four siblings need to be placed in a home during the blitz in WWII and come to the huge manse of one Professor Kirke. There they find a huge wardrobe which sometimes acts as a portal to another world. I never read these books as a child but will go back and read them now. The story is allegorical and symbolic to be sure, but for those of you that do not want to be bogged down with that - have no fear it isn't needed at all to enjoy this. The rest of the story takes on a Lord of the Rings scope as good vs. evil in the form of the four youngsters(now in a mythical world called Narnia) and aided by Aslan a giant of a lion fight the wicked White Witch and her evil minions for supremacy. Director Andrew Adamson, also from New Zealand(like Peter Jackson), is able to pull off much in this his first full-scale non-animation film. Previously he directed both Shrek films. Adamson hits a couple of slow patches early on but his world that he created comes bursting to life on the screen with vibrant colors and weird, fairly believable characters. There are many weird creatures such as a centaur, a pair of cockney-speaking beavers, and a pack of deadly wolves. The film ends with a typical battle scene but that is done rather well at any rate. What makes this film work besides the energetic direction and the imaginative script is the acting. The four children all do a reasonably good job: a must when having youngsters perform as protagonists. None of them is particularly detrimental. The young girl playing Lucy is particularly good. Liam Neeson lends his mighty voice to the Lion - a feat of filming. The two digitally created beavers are also most impressive and bring lots of subtle laughs to the proceedings. But the real star if you will is Tilda Swinton giving lessons on how to be wicked and look as pale as ever. Swinton plays evil almost too well. Jim Broadbent plays the professor and even though his role is minor, his presence is necessary. A very good film.",8,6,9,29 December 2005
Spider-Man 2," Raimi Weaves a Great Web!
","This sequel to the first Spiderman, a film I thought was imaginative and wonderful, is at the very least that film's equal and in all probability a better film. The story picks up with Peter Parker resuming his career as the webbed crusader while going to school and trying to make ends meet as a pizza delivery guy. He also pines for Mary Jane, must hear the relentless diatribes of his friend Harry on what he will do if he catches Spiderman, and stand idly by as his Aunt loses her home. Well, Peter must realize who he is and what he wants in life - of course, while he does this a well-meaning scientist turns into a four mechanical armed menace and threat to the city of New York. Dr. Octopus becomes Spidey's number one nemesis and director Sam Raimi once again dazzles with his flair as a director in creating suspenseful action scenes, poignant, touching scenes, and some scenes with real humour. This again is not Citizen Kane but is a fine film with a great story, solid characterizations, exciting action-packed tension, some great CGI effects, and some good ole' fashioned fun. All of the performers return for a second bow and do equally well again. I particularly thought Rosemary Harris's performance and McGuire's were the most well-rounded. Alfred Molina is Doc Oc, and he is excellent. I wish he had had more time as the sane doctor, because he was very credible. As a villain, he was able to throw off one-liners very nicely as well. Look for Bruce Campbell in a great cameo as a snooty usher. The end leaves door open for an obvious sequel concerning a Green Goblin. He made me laugh sooo hard! One great roller coaster of a film ride!",8,1,2,30 March 2005
The Mummy," Great Adventurous Fun!
","Certainly this Universal remake is more in the vain of Indiana Jones rather than the original Mummy.  It is high on adventure and comedy, and wins because of it.  The sets, scenery, special effects are all first-rate.  The film is fast-paced from beginning to end and is very suspenseful.  Stephen Sommers again shows his talent as a director for creating action-packed adventure with a high level of comedic overtones.  The cast are all very good in their roles, yet none of them seem really to be taking themselves or the film too serious.  Brendan Fraser is an affable hero, and Rachel Weisz makes a good heroine.  Good support comes from John Hannah, Kevin J. O'Connor, and the mummy, Arnold Vosloo.  Also a real treat was seeing Bernard Fox in a small role as an aging British pilot.  Don't expect the old mummy of lore in this one, but sit down and have one heck of a ride...a rollercoaster of hijinks in the sands of Egypt.",Null,90,96,23 July 2000
Constantine," Blow , Gabriel, Blow
","Having no awareness of the comic book, Constantine for me was...alright I guess. It starts out very feebly with Keanu Reeves performing an exorcism. If you want to see some miscasting, then look no farther than here. Now, I am not going to say Reeves is horrible. He isn't nor is he good. He is Keanu Reeves playing John Constantine, a man that helps God by killing demons(half-demons I think they were called)that try to cross over into our world. He does not help God because of goodness but rather for a hopeful gain to be admitted to Heaven for services rendered. I believe this is the basic background. Reeves is then paired with a police detective whose sister mysteriously committed suicide and who possesses psychic powers, etc... Constantine certainly has a very complex and developed story and I, for the most part, found much of it intriguing if nothing else. The idea that two forces combat daily over souls and keep a tally sheet for deeds performed was done in an interesting fashion. There is an over-propensity by director Francis Lawrence to use special effects here, there, and everywhere. Some of them are quite dazzling; some of them look like the frosting on top of the frosting on top of the cake. Lawrence does do some scenes very stylishly. I was confused a bit with the storyline here and there, but nothing multiple viewings should be able to correct - should one be so inclined. I confess I am not. For all its interesting plot contrivances, thematic battle of good and bad with Angel Gabriel and Satan as well in tow as characters, and sense of style, the film is just not coherent enough to make any real sense nor do the actors at hand have the depth to carry off any true believability. Reeves is barely adequate for this kind of role and it shows. He quips one-liners ala James Bond with a stone-faced incredulity that makes him almost seem clownish. You must have a lead that can lead. The other performers are not bad. Tilda Swinton as Gabriel, a complex character that I had particular trouble understanding, gives a very unique interpretation of what an angel would be like in human form. I guess my review is lukewarm at best: I liked the concept but not fully the execution.",5,1,5,19 December 2005
Ed Wood," Brilliant, funny, and a homage to the past!
","Ed Wood is one of those rare films that grows on you with each respective viewing, and since I fell in love with it the first time I saw it...it still gets better and better.  Who would have thought the career of one Edward D. Wood Jr. would become a household word practically?  I never would have believed it...but its true.  The director of such films as Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster, and his infamous Plan Nine From Outer Space is big business and world famous.  If you don't believe me, just look in any horror magazine or cult publication.  Why?  Give the credit to this film, Tim Burton, Johnny Depp and other actors, one oscar winner named Martin Landau, and one fantastically funny, sensitive and nostalgic script.  This movie has it all and it is a non-stop look at the movie business for the independent film-maker in the fifties who just happened to like dressing up as a woman and befriended interesting individuals like a man who wanted a sex change operation, a wrestler-turned-actor, a phony larger-than-life psychic, and of course one man named Bela Lugosi, forgotten by Hollywood but not gone.  Tim Burton wisely chose to do this film in glorious black and white, and the photography, lighting, and shading are first-rate.  The script bends the truth quite often about Wood and his cast of irregulars, but then again this is a film meant to entertain not instruct.  Bela, as far as horror icon Forry Ackerman knows...and who alive would know better...never swore so much as even saying a damn.  But Landau is so convincing as the aged Bela...rejected by Holloywood and lost to poverty and obscurity..that his performance has resurrected interest in Lugosi and his films, and for one time brought him more popularity than his horror crony Karloff.  This film is an experience and if you haven't see it...do so.  It is really as good as every one says.",Null,1,1,19 September 1999
The Day After Tomorrow," Oh! The Weather Outside Is Frightful...
","I really enjoyed this film by director Roland Emmerich a great deal. It is a fast-paced, exciting, suspenseful film filled with wonderful images, great CGI effects, plausible acting, and even a coherent script. How realistic is it? I hope not at all, but the director made the film so that it seems very real and like something that MIGHT happen. The story revolves around some major climatic shifts that cause the entire Northern hemisphere to become Artic tundra. New York City is devastated as are other major cities all over Europe. Dennis Quaid gives a good performance as a climatologist that predicted some of these events. We see things through his perspective and that of his son for much of the movie. The acting in general is good in this film. I particularly liked Ian Holm's role as the British meteorologist stuck in the middle of nowhere while these changes advanced. Much of the credit for the film's success must go to Emmerich. This is easily one of his best films. He keeps his viewer on the edge of his/her seat through the entire film. Action is the film's primary objective, but Emmerich also uses a lot of humanity in what his character's motivations are, and I for one, enjoyed seeing that side of humanity rather than what I probably would see under similar circumstances. As a previous viewer noted, this is a great popcorn movie!",8,201,322,24 December 2004
X-Men," Entertaining Comic Caper
","X-Men is a fun, fantastic, and futuristic look at what life might be like if human beings were surrounded with mutants(people that possess special powers).  Created from the famous Marvel Comics, Bryan Singer directs this material with a golden hand, turning what many might consider comic fodder into screen magic.  The special effects are wonderful and play a large part in the film, but what really sets this film off from others of its like is its very humanistic approach to different philosophical viewpoints with regard to evil and good.  Lots of grey here as the primary villain is a man that has seen evil in his own life and has grown to be distrustful of mankind in general. Ian McKellen plays the complex Magneto with a rich aplomb for finesse.  His scenes are probably the most entertaining, yet he is ably assisted by all the actors concerned.  Patrick Stewart does an equally good job as Professor Xavier.  Stewart and McKellen are two reasons why this film rises above the material.  Class acts.  Wolverine is played by relative unknown Hugh Jackman, who has a kinetic screen presence.  He does a wonderful job with his role as do Anna Paquin, and all others concerned. This is a great way to spend ninety minutes!",Null,0,1,19 September 2001
The Terminator," No! No ! No ! No ! No ! Mr. Roboto!
","Highly enjoyable, well-directed, and evenly scripted foray into the nature of time and what could happen if earlier events were tampered with in the future.  The movie opens...you know all that stuff I am sure.  I find the whole idea of changing spatial realities fascinating.  Arnold comes to Earth to kill a woman that will bear a child that causes a future controlled by machines much grief.  Another being - a man - also comes through time to see if he can save the woman.  The story really is the strength of this film. Cameron does a quality job with the direction giving us more than enough special effects, car collisions, shootings, and a tireless parade of swan songs for the Robot, yet the script is able to promote a sense of humanity through all this with its interesting plot and characterizations.  Linda Hamilton does a fine job as a beautiful woman just trying to make a living who is all of a sudden sucked into a 21st century plot that desires her death and will stop at no means to acquire it.  Michael Biehn is good too, as is the rest of the cast.  I really enjoyed the by-play between Paul Winfield and Lance Henrickson as policemen.  Arnold is Arnold.  He is the Terminator.  It is one of his better performances, because he has such little dialogue and has an odd ability to look menacing and void of any great thought.",Null,0,0,6 April 2003
Sleepy Hollow," Gothic Gore
","Wow!  What an experience viewing this film was!  Tim Burton has done it again, and has created a marvelous, gothic modern horror classic.  Sleepy Hollow is undoubtedly one of the most atmospheric horror films to be made of late.  It has gobs of gory blood, splendid acting(most notably from the ever-impressive Johhny Depp), a caravan full of suspense, and the typical Burton touches of witty dialogue, creative secondary characters/casting, and some most bizarre and impressive special effects.  The film is as fraught full of laughs as it is fright.  And the advertisement does not lie when it says...Heads will roll...and indeed they do...again and again. My only major complaint is that veteran horror star Christopher Lee is basically an ornament in one scene and only one scene.  Pity his greatness was wasted. Nonetheless....A must-see!",Null,0,0,19 November 1999
Blade II," Vampires Make Horrible Parents!
","Blade and his alter ego Wesley Snipes are back yet again to battle the vampiric scourge terrifying the world of the humans.  But this time he helps...that's right, you heard me...helps the vampires fight a mutant vampire that prefers feeding on vampires over humans.  Well, to spin a long (actually not that long or terribly complicated) story, Blade is...Sorry I cannot say anymore or I might give away too much of the plot - and you know movies like this are plot-driven.  This film is exactly what you would expect.  Gobs of blood, tons(maybe even more!) of CGI's kicking heads in, bashing heads in, splitting bodies, turning into sparkling dust, and so on and so on and so on, cute one liners with Wesley twisting his neck a lot, and lots of techo-weapons designed to do everything and anything to the body.  Is it a great film?  Get real.  Is it entertaining?  Yes, somewhat of a guilty pleasure for me I must confess.  Snipes never seems to take his role or what is going on too seriously with his low-key, stoic acting.  Kris Kristofferson is back as Whistler.  You might remember he died in the first Blade movie, but through some plot contrivance that was designed for us not to really understand - he is back and much older and somewhat wiser for wear.  The rest of the cast is acceptable EXCEPT for Reedus who is annoying. Ron Pearlman seems to be having the most fun hamming it up as a villainous vampire out to get Snipes.  All in all not a bad way to spend an hour or two.",Null,17,26,6 April 2003
Alien," Ground-breaking Sci-fi/Horror Masterpiece
","Alien...a masterpiece?  Yes, I think it has stood the test of time very well.  It has had three QUALITY(if not even) sequels.  It has more than amply influenced all science fiction films to come after it.  It made the female macho heroine stock rather than exceptional.  It has so immersed us in its design, sets, and situations as to even be used of late in some kind of snack food commercial and be lampooned by Mel Brooks.  The story of the Nostromo and crew going to a dead planet after hearing some kind of distress signal is all too recognizable.  While there, one of their party has a baby alien attatch itself to his face, later his belly opens up and a small alien rips its way out.  The alien grows with great speed and soon is a giant of a stowaway on this small, 7-manned crew commercial ship.  Predator and prey meet.  While the basic story is fairly simple, some of the overlying themes used in Dan O'Bannon's script reek with thought-provoking insights into the division of science and humanity(or humanism if you prefer).  What lengths should science go to acquire new knowledge?  What are necessary sacrifices? The script also details the greedy exploits of business with the Mother company being all too concerned with possible military profits rather than the lives of its crew.  Ridley Scott directs with definite style, if not a bit plodding through much of the first half of the film.  The sets used are breath-taking, and the scientific mumbo jumbo presented is given its full due in explanation and observable merit.  The special effects department really does a great job with the alien creature as it is truly one of the most menacing monsters to grace the screen in some time.  Acting honors go to Sigourney Weaver in her penultimate role as Ripley, the head-strong, no-nonsense, by the book navigator that manages to elude the alien for some time.  Her wits and its hostility lock horns in some great film sequences. Scott's use of bleak metal exteriors really enhances the mood of doom, despair, and futility that pervades the film.  The rest of the cast is very good with Ian Holm standing out as an android of sorts whose only goal is securing knowledge at any price.  While not as gritty or energized as its sequel Aliens, Alien is one of the finest horror/sci-fi films made in the last twenty-five years.  It will go on being an inspiration to future genre films for some time.",Null,0,1,9 February 2002
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Overall Satisfying Though Not Quite Full
","I love the Sondheim musical and the performances of the great Angela Lansbury, Len Cariou, George Hearn, and company. The music was breathtaking and every note had a purpose - not such the case in virtually every musical before and since. Tim Burton took on quite a task of bringing the three-hour epic musical to the screen. It was with trepidation and enthusiasm that I went and was overall pleased yet not quite satisfied. On the plus side I have always admired Burton and his vision in film. It is about as pure as it can get for this medium. He tackles what interests him for the most part just as his popular star Johnny Depp does as well. Depp always gives a good performance and here is no different. He even sings much better than I thought. The film is gorgeous with lush colour dripping in every scene, attentive detail given to set design and costume, and some wonderful lighting. Burton's London is almost surreal and yet breathtaking all the time. The blood flows generously - as it would in this film. Burton is not shy in showing the dark side of life. The performances are all pretty good. Depp was better than expected and manages to embody the skulking silence of Todd torn by thoughts of revenge and personal tragedy very nicely. Helena Bonham Carter looks th part of Mrs. Lovett(except for the plunging neckline I cannot quite remember seeing Miss Lansbury proffer) though the singing aspect of the role is quite honestly a bit much for her abilities; nonetheless, she is acceptable. Alan Rickman makes a formidable judge(though he cannot sing a lick), Timothy Spall makes a convincing Beadle(not asked to sing for the most part), and Sacha Baron Cohen really shines in a scene-stealing role as Pirelli. The rest of the major roles, Johanna, Tobias, and Anthony, are all played by newcomers who all out-perform the stars in terms of real singing talent however. It is important to remember that Sweeney Todd is 80% or more sung not spoken. The lack of singing ability from the stars does have to detract somewhat from the film especially for a fan of the original Broadway hit. But Burton's direction and the cast rise above these small problems and create a film that is highly enjoyable and entertaining. For me the biggest problem wasn't the lack of singing talent but the material that was cut from the original play. Whether for budgetary or time constraints or both, Burton shaved about an hour off the original musical composition: whole songs(at least four that I could count), bastardized lyrics(some songs edited heavily), and a frame story of storytellers telling us to attend the tale of Sweeney Todd MIA. I wish that Burton could have included these in the film and missed them sorely. But for the individual that is not familiar with the original at all or only briefly, this won't even be a minor consideration. So all in all I really enjoyed this production just wished I had more to taste.",8,3,5,13 January 2008
The Polar Express," Fasten Your Seatbelts, It's Going to be a Bumpy Ride
","Robert Zemeckis teams up with Tom Hanks once again in this children's fantasy film about children being taken to the North Pole to see Santa and his world via a magical train called the Polar Express. This is definitely geared more toward the adolescents than the adults. The film has some outstanding animation process which creates a reality out of animation if you will. I personally found the process quite fascinating, but I must confess that I must have looked at my watch at least six or seven times during the course of the film. Never a good sign. At a running length of 99 minutes, The Polar Express seemed more like the Pony Express than Amtrak. There is nothing individually that I can pinpoint as a major, upsetting problem with the film. The animation was terrific, the voices(with exception of Eddie Deezen's which really got on my nerves as it was undoubtedly suppose to)were well-matched to their graphic counterpoints, the song and spirit of the film were nice, and the action scenes leading to the North Pole were exciting and suspenseful - yet, the film for me was rather boring. It really didn't do anything for me . It didn't cause me to hate it, but I said right after seeing it that I had no desire to see it again. Not much really happens in terms of concrete plot. Tom Hanks does some nice engineering as several different 'roles' if you will. I think I liked his conductor best. I found Santa to be rather bland - as much of the film chronicling the adventures of the three 'lost' children in the village at the North Pole.",5,1,4,29 December 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Two is Better than One
","A fine sequel - and a much better film - then The Phantom Menace, Star Wars: Attack of the Clones is a visual treat and non-stop action. The story weaves the threads given to us by Lucas in The Phantom Menace and makes all possible in the third installment. This film has the suspense and credibility that the first lacks at places. McGregor is back as Obi Ben. He does a fine job as do Star War stalwarts Samuel Jackson, Frank Oz(as Yoda), the droid actors, Ian McDiarmind, and Natalie Portman. The great horror icon Christopher Lee appears as the nemesis Count Dooku(not crazy about the name either) and is wonderful. The man is in his eighties and still exudes poise and commanding presence. My biggest problem acting-wise is Hayden Christiansen as the soon-to-be-Darth Vadar. I just didn't 'buy' him nor found him convincing at all. Fortunately, Lucas's direction, the story, and the awesome CGI effects make that a small quibble rather than a large one. An exhilarating, exciting ride toward explanation and closure to the first three installments of this great space opera.",7,0,3,16 June 2005
Corpse Bride," Enchanting, Magical, and the Very Essence of Burtonesque
","Tim Burton has done it again with Corpse Bride. He has created something imaginative, innovative, unique, and full of heart. Much has been written about the plot, which I find to be very streamlined and cohesive for an animation project such as this. Burton's characters are much more dimensional than those you find in most other animation films. Victor Van Glot must marry Victoria(yes, I love the Victor/Victoria thing)so his parents can become part of the old rich and her parents can remain in that club as they are broke. Victor has some issues; however, which make him run into the woods and accidentally propose to a branch that happens to have a corpse bride underneath that accepts his hand in marriage. What follows is a dark, beautiful trip to another world where the dead live after they have lived out their 'fleshy' existences. Lots of eccentric characters abound with Burton having fun with the idea of how some died. We have a gentleman that splits in two, a 'head' waiter which is nothing more than a head, a little Bonaparte-looking soldier, a cast of skeletons that sing and dance no less, and the corpse bride herself - a character that is so beautiful despite her outward appearance. Burton gives these characters more heart and life than any of the 'living' characters. In fact I find it very interesting that the living are presented in cold, austere surroundings devoid of any real emotion while the dead are happy and content with what fate has befallen them, The animation process is amazing as figures are used rather than cells. Kudos to directors Burton and Mike Johnson for bringing both worlds alive. At the very heart of this film is a love story between a frightened young boy and an unhappy girl who have both come into contact with a soul full of longing and desire for something she was cheated out of in life. Johnny Depp does Victor's voice superbly and Emily Watson is Victoria. Helena Bonham Carter does an extremely good job 'breathing' life into the vanquished bride. As with many of Burton's films, a host of older stars of generations past are given jobs. Christopher Lee, Joanna Lumley, Albert Finney, and Michael Gough all have prominent roles - all doing very good jobs. The music of Danny Elfman is right on the mark in this one creating another fantasy world as well through sound. Buron uses lots of humour in dialog and makes the viewer think about much of it. I thought the maggot with the Peter Lorre accent was so funny and many of his jokes were darkly humorous. The film runs a little over an hour but doesn't cheat the story in any way. Fantastical subjects, dark yet inviting, compassionate visions, lyrical music all help make this film fan the very essence of what a Burton fantasy is all about. If you know what that entails, than you will undoubtedly find the Corpse Bride very Burtonesque!",8,0,1,16 April 2006
"Monsters, Inc."," Coming Out of the Closet
","Great Pixar animated film about two monsters living in Monstropolis - a land outside human land where monsters of all sorts live. Power is generated by the screams of children from Monsters, Inc. - a factory where doors of small children are presented in assembly-line fashion for monsters to walk through and scare children. I was overwhelmed with the concept of the film for its incredible imagination, innovation, and creativity. The folks at Pixar always seem to be able to pull films like this off with ease. At the heart of this film is the friendship of one huge, all-time(almost) scare monster and his assistant - voiced by John Goodman and Billy Crystal respectively. The characters are penned to fit the voices like hands to gloves. The puns and funny wordplay, particularly by Crystal, are an added bonus and raises much of this as just being another kid's movie. It isn't. What happens? Well, a child manages to come in to the monster world and chaos and fun ensue, but also an emotional quality is created with the depth of characterization of Sully(Goodman). The additional voices by Bob Peterson, James Coburn, and oily Steve Buschemi - not to mention Pixar stalwart John Ratzenberger as the Abominable Snowman(monsters like these had been banished - love the concept again!) greatly enhance the film. But it is the magical animation which seems real more often than not that really propels the engine of this film. This is impressive entertainment from a company that knows what entertainment is all about. In one scene, if you look closely, you will see the child in her room and have a small toy of a clown fish - a couple years before Pixar released Finding Nemo. Love the clever nature of these folks. Any film that can explain to my satisfaction, covering all bases, why monsters come out of closets has to be pretty good.",8,0,1,24 July 2006
Captain America: The First Avenger," I Rather Enjoyed It - a LOT!
","For the recent rash of Marvel Comics oriented films from the last few years, I found this one to be the most enjoyable for me. Why? I am sure it has to do with the primary setting of the film as war-torn America in the 1940s, Nazis(they ALWAYS make the best villains), a story with loads of heart, not too over-done special effects, and how about Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter(va-voom!) Anyway, this film starts off with a wonderful patriotic tune with some montages of the 2nd world war done credibly and with inspiration. The settings, the mood, the atmospheres mirror much of what we think of during that time - and yes, it is bent toward patriotism. Hey, the guy is called Captain America! I enjoyed the unfolding of the story. Director Joe Johnston, while not a premier director by any means, does what I think might be his best film. This was a popcorn roller-coaster ride, a Saturday morning serial, just good-old-fashioned movie entertainment - the stuff that good comics are made of. The CGI effects are done well for the most part, the set pieces are very credible for their time period, and the acting is pretty good. Chris Evans makes a very affable hero. Tommy Lee Jones is perfect as a craggy, no-nonsense army general, Hugo weaving is a good Red Skull slash Nazi pain-in-the-ass. Hayley Arwell is an adequate actress and breathtaking to behold. A buffet for the eyes to be sure. Two character actors stand out for me though: Toby Jones as Dr. Arnim Zola(he looks like the perfect Nazi scientist) and, most especially, Stanley Tucci as Dr. Abraham Erskine. His portrayal gives the jump-start for this film in terms of how it evolves. he does a very good job with a fairly small role. Of course we eventually get to Captain America being around today so that he can join The Avengers...okay, but I really liked the background story.",8,2,4,3 November 2012
Predator," Rambo Meets Alien...Sort of
","Arnold Swarzenegger, the master of the one-liner, action sequences requiring huge budgets, and the acting skill of a dead snake, brings a rag-tag commando group into the South(or Central) American jungle to find a cabinet member.  At least that is the story told to him by superior officer(and another 'great' actor) Carl Weathers.  The first half of the film(actually 40 some odd minutes) shows Arnold, Carl, and this crack commando group, which by the way is populated with the various stereotypical kind of guys like the nerdy guy with glasses making sexual jokes, the Indian that can smell danger before it happens, the rugged outdoors type(Jesse Ventura) with guts for brains, and so on)walking through the jungle, finding a group of men earlier sent in stripped to the skin, and then firing and capturing an enemy camp.  Okay...pretty boring up to here, but then things get interesting as the group plus one hostage girl are preyed upon by an alien hunter ala The Most Dangerous Game.  It seems the alien enjoys hunting for sport.  He is an impressive alien, and mucho credit goes to the genius of Stan Winston for its creation.  The alien has green, phospherescent blood, a surgical kit imbedded in its arm, and an ability to cloak itself and blend in with the jungle.  You know what is going to happen every step of the way, but the film is fun and entertaining if not taken too seriously.  Just don't look for great acting or some rich subtext here.  You won't find it.  Just some good old-fashioned man versus alien, good versus bad stuff here.",Null,3,3,2 September 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Tolkien Comes Alive!
","Director Peter Jackson remains pretty faithful to the text, feel, and character of the novel of the struggle for Middle Earth.  Amazing detail and state of the art special effects make a world like none other seem to magically come alive before our very eyes.  Filmed in New Zealand, the film boasts some incredible cinematography.  The acting is good all around with Ian McKellan really standing out as Gandalf.  The film also gives the great Christopher Lee a good-sized role as Sauramon letting him showcase his obvious talents and still impressive voice.  The film hovers round the three hour mark, but it goes by fairly quickly.  A truly creative look at the work of Tolkien.  The anticipation for the next two installments surely should be great if they are made with the same amount of care, cost, and consideration employed in this gargantuan film undertaking.  Most Impressive!!!",Null,1,1,4 March 2002
The Thing," Who Can You Trust?
","In 1951 Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby made a wonderful science fiction film called The Thing From Another World(known to many simply as The Thing.) This film served as the impetus for horror director John Carpenter to make a remake.  Carpenter makes the film his own, however, and rather than a remake we really have a completely different film with like elements. Whereas the first film focusses its main attentions to the division between science and military, Carpenter's film is more of a gory mystery to see who is the alien being inside.  There are plenty of reviews here going into great detail about the story, etc...  All I will add is that Carpenter's film is stylish, scary, well-acted by a veritable who's who of character actors like Richard Dysart, Wilfred Brimley, and many others, aided by a nice performance by Kurt Russell, and has state of the art special effects. I was mesmerized from beginning to end, and found watching the film a thoroughly entertaining time.  I am always grateful to people like John Carpenter for sharing their joy and enthusiasm for the horror and science fiction genre and paying tribute to it in their own special way.  A first-rate scare!",Null,0,1,21 May 2001
Armageddon," Get a Piece of the Rock
","Bruce Willis leads his men, a group of eccentric guys that have drilled for him all over the world, into space when NASA calls for help when news of a giant meteor coming toward the Earth hits. Director Micahel Bay does a decent job with this disaster/end of the world flick, but let's be honest here. This is no great film. It has lots of action, weird, one-dimensional characters quipping humourless one-liners, and a plot with little gravity toward any kind of reality. It is a very entertaining film yet does not compel like something like Independence Day or The Day After Tomorrow. I even enjoyed The Core more(no pun intended). Willis gives his action hero performance of little depth and Ben Affleck - well, the less said the better. Liv Tyler is nothing more than scenery, and the rest of the cast is pretty much one stereotypical character after another: the guy on the bike, the annoying man who talks all the time, etc... The guys playing these roles are fun to a degree. I enjoyed seeing Owen Wilson, Michael Clarke Duncan, Steve Buschemi, and all the rest. But none of them are real at all. The only performer I actually thought brought a little credibility to his role was Billy Bob Thornton as a head at Nasa who had a leg infirmity not allowing him to go on the mission. Bay does have some wonderful special effects of cities being destroyed and the meteor itself is quite impressive. And the ending - though coming right at you straight on does have some poignancy to it and at the same time a bit of ridiculousness as well. I am not giving Armageddon a bad review but it is an average, action film at best.",5,1,2,11 July 2005
The Village," No Spoilers...Just Spoiled!
","The Village was immensely disappointing on many levels for me. Shamalayan does a decent job with the camera. I can't fault his work with the camera too much, but the story he used for this film is anything BUT mysterious. I mean the ending is wildly predictable if you have a brain. Think about it...could there have been any other resolution. No. And so...I knew the 'big' secret way too early. The film had no punch for me at all. But that aside, the pacing for this film was real slow. Virtually nothing happens in this village. I know the village people(no cop or construction worker here) were meant to seem Amish-like, but something a little more 'meaty' could have happened. The music gave you a warning that something interesting was going to happen with a thunderous boom...only to see something like a shadow in the grass. The acting isn't bad. It is pretty decent with Ron Howard's daughter Bryce doing a pretty good job in the lead. Sigourney Weaver, Brendan Gleason, and William Hurt all do workmanlike jobs. Joaquin Phoenix was unimpressive and Adrian Brody as the village idiot was not terribly believable. But like the film...their performances really go nowhere. I will not discuss the plot in any great detail, because the slightest detail given and the 'gig' is up. All I remember saying after the film was something to the effect that I was very glad I did not pay $7.50 to see this film. The idea the film has, if it had been handled differently, might have been the catalyst for a real good story about...well, I cannot say. But it could have been better. you must take my word.",4,0,2,29 January 2005
The Hills Have Eyes," Deep in the Heart of New Mexico
","I saw the original The Hills Have Eyes - a compelling, stunning, morally bereft film by a then Wes Craven dedicated to showing the baser side of humanity on film. A chore he did surprisingly well. I knew what to expect from a remake from his 1977 film about a family of cannibals living in the New Mexico desert preying on any interlopers that might make their way through their territory. I was surprised; however, that the remake was done with so much care and attention to detail as to not just make a hasty remake but a homage to Craven's film as well. The Hills Have Eyes through its first 2/3rds is as compelling, tense, taut, relentless as the original but with greater character development. The acting in this movie was really quite good with Ted Levine standing out as the patriarch of a family going west in a huge camper with two dogs(and a couple of lovebirds). Levine is one of those actors that just has a presence about him and a believability to any character he creates. The rest of the cast does well in their roles despite being asked to undergo some major character transformations. Director Alexandre Aja shows he knows how to use a camera and I loved the location shots in Morrocco so convincingly used as the Sout-West American desert. As I earlier stated, the first 2/3rds of the film are gold(gold, Jerry!) The last 3rd, at least for me, lacks that same kind of tension as we start to get a reason WHY the cannibals are in the desert to begin with - and though I think it is a nice attempt at some kind of explanation, I just did not find it very credible. That being said, the way it was set and the look were nonetheless impressive. The remake of Craven's original film is a gory, at times very unpleasant film which has the ability to do what so few sequels do today - stand on its own feet to some extent as a movie worth seeing in its own right.",6,0,0,21 July 2007
The Orphanage," Stark and Fantastical Horror from Spain
","As a young girl Laura lived at an orphanage with a handful of other kids only to come back to that orphanage years later as a new owner and desiring to provide comfort and a place of being for some new kids. But Laura, along with her doctor husband and their seven year old adopted son Simon soon discover the orphanage has some dark secrets within. That is, in a proverbial nutshell, the basic premise behind this film, and director Juan Antonio Bayona and producer Guillermo del Toro take that basic premise and weave a haunting, fantastical, beautifully filmed vision to the screen that is at moments breathtaking to the eye and chest-grabbing to the heart. Eeerie images abound, strange noises can be overheard throughout as Laura soon loses her son Simon to the secrets within and must find some way to fill the void of Simon's absence. We get a paranormal investigation, ghostly games, and a hideous secret that has been figuratively(and literally) buried in the orphanage for years. This film has more style than many other films in its genre and is for all purposes one of the best and most stylish horror films I have seen made within the last ten or fifteen years. You can definitely see del Toro's hands involved. The acting by a primarily Spanish cast is first-rate with beautiful Belen Rueda as Laura giving a fine compassionate and chilling performance as Laura - a woman obsessed with finding her lost son at all costs. Geraldine Chaplin, speaking Spanish in a 'perfecto' manner has a nice small role as a medium. Every time I see her I see her father's doleful eyes and that beautifully simple face. The real star of this film; however, it the director's artistic vision. The film shows virtually no blood or bloodletting, yet it delivers scare after scare with sights and sounds. The mask of the child and the doll are just two of those sights which conjure a myriad of emotions. The Orphange is not a straight and traditional horror film as you will discover by film's end, but it packs a wallop of a punch and has quite a bite in it. It is thankfully subtitled and not dubbed. I forgot after ten minutes or so the film was in a foreign language(to me it is foreign at least)and was mesmerized with what was on screen. If you have never tried a foreign subtitled film, this one might be a good introduction to you.",9,2,5,5 September 2010
The Shining," Rocky Mountain High
","So much diversity in opinion here.  Well, I really cannot add much one way or the other.  I never read the book(will and want to someday), and I enjoyed the film for what it is in itself.   The compromise from bringing novel and film together is often dissatisfying for many.  Sometimes I like to read the book first, and other times I like to see the film and then read the book.  As far as horror films go, this film is chilling, haunting, and suspenseful.  It is a Stanley Kubrick film all the way, from the opening shot of a vehicle driving on the highway in mountainous terrain to the final shot of a picture on a wall.  Kubrick uses his camera to perfection in many scenes, and it's his use of the camera that makes this film stand out.  It certainly isn't the acting.  Both the leads are quite horrible.  Jack Nicholson overacts wildly and says one-liners like he is trying to impress the boys in the bar.  I found his performance to have very little credibility or depth.  Shelley Duvall isn't much better as his whimpering wife.  Scatman Crothers gives a nice performance and Daniel Lloyd is outstanding as the young boy with powers, however.  But as I stated earlier, it is Kubrick and his arrangement of scenes and his power to almost transcend the ordinary with his lens that makes the film a classic of sorts. Too many great scenes to list. The hotel that serves as the central setting is marvelous as well.",Null,0,0,11 May 2001
"I, Robot"," Things to Come
","I, Robot has a nice blend of thought-provoking story, dazzling CGI effects, credible acting, and riveting action scenes to make it a thoroughly enjoyable movie. Will Smith plays a policeman in 2035 fearing man's dependency on robots in everyday life. A mystery arises when a leading robot creator is found dead and a new shipment of state-of-the-art robots are about to hit the market place. The film has all the big budget things one would expect: Will Smith finding ample opportunity to take his shirt off, Bridget Moynahan taking a shower, repeated use of commercial tie-ins(I was SO tired of the Converse crap!), highly charged action sequences, and epic-like special effects. Much of this worked; however, for I, Robot is really a story-driven vehicle. Based on Issac Asimov's classic sci-fi novel, the film ultimately addresses concerns that may indeed become very real in the future regarding man's relationship with machine. The film is definitely well-crafted and much of the credit goes to director Alex Proyas for giving his audience a little credit for being intelligent. Will Smith makes, if nothing else, an affable hero. James Cromwell has a brief yet vital role in the film. The robots are center stage and Sonny, a wayward robot, steals all of his scenes. I really like I, Robot for its entertainment value.",Null,0,0,7 August 2004
Edward Scissorhands," Hauntingly Poetic
","I really cannot add too much more to the wealth of praise directed toward this film...much of it very deserved.  Tim Burton really shows us his ability to transcend mere comedic situations(Pee Wee and Beetlejuice) and tell a story of humour love, pity, conformity, and so on in an eerie and entertaining way.  The way this film is constructed is amazing...the sets are wonderful as they depict something so real and yet so far away.  Burton takes us into a kind of fairy land of Suburbia...with a haunting, empty castle at the end of the block that just happens to house a man with scissors for hands.  The music in this film helps create a great deal of atmosphere and really lends to character development;  I particularly enjoyed his use of the music of Tom Jones.  The acting in the film is superb on all accounts.  Burton got a subtle and effective performance from Johhny Depp, whose talents cease to amaze me.  A nice Burton touch was the use of Vincent Price in one of his final roles.  Although only in three scenes, seeing Vincent again was a real joy.",Null,78,97,25 July 2000
Van Helsing," Dracula Isn't the Only Thing That Sucks!
","I'm a classic horror/monster fan. I grew up with Frankenstein's monster, Dracula, the wolfman, the mummy, and all those fondly remembered others. I have learned through the years that film makers cannot cater to an older crowd and their nostalgic images of what some particular thing should be like. That's fine. I can live with that. But when something is as perverted as this and tries to seem like it is something from the past. That bothers me. Supposedly Van Helsing in the late 1800's has weapons we have not dreamed of here. He has super human skills such as great agility and strength. Those are explained later in the film for the few that still might care after the mindless barrage of CGI effects and one-liners. This isn't a horror film. This is another action film like what Stephen Sommers did in The Mummy films only done with less integrity to the source material and with lesser talents working toward greater expectations. I remember distinctly saying after seeing the Mr. Hyde segment early in the film that'This movie sucks big time!' That said after less than ten to fifteen minutes into the film. From there things only got worse. Sure I could go on and on about the ridiculous script, the one dimensional acting, Kate Beckinsdale's accent(at least she is a treat to look at!), the over-used CGI effects for action scenes and settings, the Van Helsing poor man Indiana Jones mixed with supernatural powers creation, and so much more. What could be said for the film? Like all of Sommers work, it is watchable if nothing else. Most of the dialogue is inane but never seems to take itself too seriously. Of all the creatures, the Frankenstein's monster(here unbelievably called Frankenstein!)had the truest sense of what the character was suppose to be. David Wendham shined as a monk with technology that would make James Bond's Q pale in comparison. And Sommers obviously tries to pay homage to the great Universal movie monsters - rather unsuccessfully I think - but tries nonetheless. He also pays homage to Roman Polanski's The Fearless Vampire Killers with a nice ballroom scene reminiscent of that film. When all is said and done; however, I really felt bad having seen the film. Not because it wasn't entertaining. It was to a degree, but more because of what it could have been, what it should have been, and what it would have been if Sommers and Universal had had the guts and backbone to not cater to 15 year-olds exclusively.",Null,2,4,7 November 2004
Spider-Man," Masterfully Woven
","Sam Raimi does a more than capable job bringing the webbed super hero Spiderman to the screen in this big budget film. Spiderman has it all: great action scenes, decent plot, good, solid acting, a sense of humour, and heart. Young Peter Parker is bitten by a spider...oh, hey, you know the rest. Tobey MacGuire does a very good job bringing Parker's character some dimension as does Kirsten Dunst. Those two have some apparent chemistry. William Dafoe is as always very good as the villain. His Green Goblin is quite menacing. Oscar winner Cliff Roberston gets the oft-repeated tagline that' with great power comes great responsibility.' Seems hokey, but it worked for me. J.K. Simmons and Rosemary Harris excel as what you think Jonah Jameson and Aunt May should be. Raimi really works his magic with the special effects. He uses just enough live action in the film to not make the film look like nothing more than a CGI film(see the abyss-mal Hulk if you are not sure what I am talking about). The scenes with Spidey flying through the streets throwing one web over another was just mesmerizing to me. Most of all in the film I liked the message it gave. Good can defeat evil. Spidey, Peter Parker, is a young hero with scruples and morals. You rarely see the likes of him on screen today.",Null,0,2,7 November 2004
Dark City," Where Strangers Aren't Strange
","I saw Dark City and was mesmerized from the beginning to the end.  It is a very complex science fiction film in that much is going on and you must really pay attention to try...and I use that word because there are a few things I am still not sure of....to understand all that is happening.  I am pretty sure though that I got the basic points of the film down and I am just bowled over by the creativity and innovation used in the film.  The story deals with this group of strangers, a dying alien race, who manipulate the lives of human beings in a Dark City...a sort of hamster cage if you will...to try and find what composes the human spirit and soul.  The sets used in the film immediately reminded me of the ones used in Brazil.  They have that kind of nostalgia/modernization combination going.  The special effects are very effective and the writing and direction are first-rate. For me, however, the acting was the thing that put this film in the better than average category.  Forget what a couple reviewers said about Keifer Sutherland,William Hurt, and Rufus Sewell and their inability to act. All three do a rousing job in this film.  Sewell is perfect as the man caught in a dream so to speak.  Hurt is also very effective as a policeman.  His low profile acting compliments the film's pace and other actors very nicely. But for me, the real treat was Keifer Sutherland's role as a doctor who is not all too nice.  He affects a limp and a sort of Germanic lisp, and I must say he performs wonderfully.  It is his best role to date..and he has performed very nicely in several other films(A Few Good Men comes to mind very quickly).  The female lead is the weakest link(unfortunately we could not say Goodbye and see her exit the screen.  Jennifer Connely acts with little savvy, yet she is a real treat to look at.  I am just not sure THAT is enough to be billed as an actress in a film. Alex Proyos, the director and creator of the conceptual background of the film, should be praised for this thoroughly enjoyable,entertaining,thoughtprovoking adventure into science fiction.  It is definitely the type of film one can see many times and find new things over and over again in.  Also, as a note of interest, that is British stage and screen veteran Ian Richardson as Mr. Book....he does a nice job too.",Null,1,4,2 July 2001
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," The Least of Potter Films So Far
","Maybe I am too jaded today, or maybe I don't like a lot of change, but change came plenty in this third installment of the Harry Potter films. I have never read one printed word of the series, but I did see and enjoy the first two films immensely. They were gorgeous, splendid, exciting films laced with suspenseful action scenes, quirky, genuine acting performances, and likable heroes. Not so for this film. As Harry, Ron, and Hermione age and become teens, I found that I liked them a good deal less as rebellious teenagers(another viewer touched on this earlier). Don't get me wrong. I know it is the natural progression of events. But I see too much of this in real life(and am not fond of it at all), I just didn't seem to care or appreciate Harry's problems in this one. Point number two: the acting in this film was not up to snuff with the other two. There are I think two reasons for this. One, the 'bad' guy Gary Oldman has virtually nothing to do or say. When he is on screen he gives one of his most boring, humdrum performances I ever seen from someone with his talent. Emma Thompson is wasted in her role as an instructor, and Michael Gambon has none of the charm Richard Harris gave to the Dummbledorf(?) role. There was no Jon Cleese cameo. Richard Griffiths has a very small role as Harry's bad uncle. Maggie Smith has maybe two lines. Why bother having her in the film? At least Alan Rickman and David Thewlis add some meat to this otherwise lean offering in terms of acting. The second reason is that the actors were not nearly as developed as they had been in the previous two films. Where was the tenderness between Harry and Dumbledorf? Daniel Radcliffe's angst over his parent's series of unfortunate events was not realistic nor was it even passably believable. Another thing that happens with child actors as they age is that much that they could get away with as younger children they cannot as they age. The cute factor or the believability factor decreases or in this disappears. What the film does have going for it are some well-shot action sequences with some impressive CGI effects. The game scene in the rain was especially breath-taking and the hippogryph was amazing. The movie is not bad, but, for me at least, it just doesn't conjure the same kind of magic the first Potter films did. Of course much of that change came with a new director with few legitimate screen credits to take on a project of this size. It is a bit darker in some ways, but the plot doesn't seem to be nearly as cohesive as the first two. I guess as its cast will not get any younger - I probably will never feel the same way about future Potter installments. Mouthy teenagers just don't seem to engage me at all but rather enrage me.",5,6,13,26 December 2004
Aliens," Superior Sequel
","Vastly more entertaining and exciting than the original, Aliens takes the central character of Ellen Ripley and brings her back to a colonized planet with an alien presence amidst doubts by crew going with her of her sanity. All that changes of course once arrived on the planet and having met the alien presence.  Director James Cameron does everything right in this film. The acting is very good, with Weaver giving a compelling performance filled with depth.  Lance Henriksen does an equally impressive job as a robot of sorts.  Paul Reiser plays a low-life scum with amazing conviction.  The rest of the cast works very well.  Bill Paxton plays an annoying marine-type fighter cracking under stress. I was annoyed with him in short time...to put it shortly.  Cameron steps the pace of this film up ten times what it was in Ridley Scott's ground-breaking original.  There is no lack of suspense.  The alien(s) is/are impressive as our the climatic scenes in the end of the film.  Like the first film, Aliens has a message about science versus life, corporate greed, military goals, and much more.  The band of gung-ho marines revel in their jobs of fighting prior to reaching the planet, yet once they land change their minds quickly, an interesting footnote to the reality of violence for those that believe they are indestructable.  A great science fiction film!",Null,0,0,4 May 2002
The Exorcist," Quite Chilling....Quite Effective
","Known more for its more lurid aspects such as a young Linda Blair vomiting green pea soup, spinning her head completely around, committing various acts of sacrilege and blasphemy, and spouting forth an incredible amount of graphic verbal vulgarity, The Exorcist is so much more than just those trademarks.  It is a disturbing psychological essay on human nature when confronted with a crisis.  It is a philosophical debate between evil and Religion.  It is an indictment on the world of science and what it supposedly knows, and a supporter of the supernatural, not only in the world of demons but also in the world of Religion.  It is above all a thinking picture fraught with visually nightmarish visions, strident and disturbing sounds, words and phrases, and ghastly contexts in which we the audience can examine our own beliefs both in the realm of the logical and the spiritual.The film boasts so many strong points such as a well-developed script that allows us to know each of the characters with some degree of intimacy.  We share in the pain of Ellen Burstyn and Jason Miller.  The acting is first-rate.  Blair is very effective as the demonic child.  Mercedes McCambridge does an outstanding and incredibly eerie job voicing the demon. The real stars of the film are the two priests, played with dedication by both Max Von Sydow and Jason Miller.  Miller is the real catalyst in the film. The music is superb; the sets and shooting of Georgetown add both class and familiarity to the film.  Lee J. Cobb also does a  real nice job playing a movie-loving cop.  Despite the thinking elements in the film, the film is a shocker in many ways....bear that in mind as you sit down to watch.",Null,2,3,13 June 2000
Resident Evil," Unimpressive
","A virus is purposely leaked in a subterranean complex known as the 'Hive.' A computer, called the Red Queen, shuts off the complex and kills everyone in it. The virus brings the dead back to life as flesh-eating zombies lying in wait as a group of military police and one other break in to shut the computer down and restore order if possible. The plot of this film is very complex and muddled. Throw in some unrealistic action scenes, bad dialog, and some poor actors and you have the heart of Resident Evil. I have totally no familiarity with the video game, and I think this movie travels very little from the mindset of that venue. The film definitely has a nice look to it. The special effects are good as well, but the action driven plot moves way too quickly for the viewer to internalize the story and get to know the characters. The most interesting characters die very quickly and soon we are left with cliché-drawn actors that flip up walls and use leg kicks to the zombie's heads. The 'witty' reparte between characters is so hackneyed and ridiculous that we get lines like 'when I get out of here I am going to get laid.' The line is said by a woman having had her hand bitten into and just hearing that anyone that even had a scratch from the dead would turn into the same. Michelle Rodriguez played this role with NO conviction at all. Milla Jovovitch gives her typically blank face performance as the female lead bouncing up walls and performing one 'kick-ass' stunt after another. Ho...Hum. Director Paul Anderson does have some flair for directing and some scenes are particularly well choreographed (the scene with the laser I thought was quite innovative). If you are out looking for a film with lots of action, lots of blood, and lots of special effects like giant mutated dogs and some creature with a big tongue, not to mention the hordes of dead, and have little need of a coherent plot, decent acting, and sparkling, crisp dialog - not to mention some good old-fashioned common sense - then I recommend Resident Evil.",Null,0,1,4 December 2004
Independence Day," Suspenseful Feel Good Fun!
","I am just shocked at all the negative reviews by pseudo-intellectuals saying the film was heavily flawed, incomprehensible, devoid of any merit, and 'lame', to quote a few.  What were they expecting?  A remake of 2001:  A Space Odyssey.  Sure, I am not going to pretend the film does not has many glaring weaknesses.  The plot is hardly original; its execution is even less inspiring.  Roland Emmerich goes out of his way to use every cliche in the book, over-sentimentality, weak, flat characterizations, incredible jumps in logic and reasoning made on the viewer, and the use of special effects to overcome these shortcomings.  But what some of the reviewers seemed to have missed, and its there as substantiated by the huge popularity of the film, is heart. The film has a lot of heart.  It makes you feel good after watching it.  And although that quality does not make it a great film, it certainly makes it a good film in my book.  The film is vastly entertaining, very suspenseful, a delight for the eyes with dazzling special effects, and even has some dialogue that does just rise above its hackneyed origins.  The acting is adequate all around with no one pulling off a great performance, but a few doing marvelous jobs with what they have to work with.  Judd Hirsch easily out acts his fellow colleagues as a Jewish father with a gift for common sense and lack of tact.  Jeff Goldblum also gives a pretty good performance as his son.  Yeah, Will Smith is just Will Smith..lots of one liners and little meat so to speak.  But he is bearable.  Watch for Brent Spiner in an outrageous role as a hippie scientist.  His performance is a real hoot!  If you are looking for philosophical science fiction, this is not it.  See Starship Troopers(a great film).  This is just good old Americans against the universe stuff, lots of action but little substance. But whatever it may have as its faults, it is a fun, happy, sad, charming, engrossing film to watch...time and time again.",Null,285,444,26 May 2001
Alien vs. Predator," Do Vs. Movies Ever Really Work?
","I saw Alien Vs. Predator and had ambivalent feelings about it. It definitely could have been a lot better, had better actors, better script, better reason and logic, and better atmosphere. It also could have been much worse than it was as well. What is does have going for it to some small degree is that the film was directed by Paul W. S. Anderson,a competent suspense, science fiction director accustomed to working with this kind of material. Anderson gives the audience what he thinks they want to see, and going by the money his movies make he doesn't fall far off the mark most of the time. For me(being someone I gratefully acknowledge as being outside the majority of the movie-going population) he disappoints with his cliché-ridden dialog, tissue-thin, stereotypical characters and plot threads, his over-used CGI effects, and his general arrogance to presume how little the movie-going population knows. Notwithstanding all of that, Alien Vs. Predator has some special moments. What did I like: some of the sets were impressive, a couple of the fights were well-executed, Lance Henriksen(being the only 'real' actor in the film, and the Artic setting surrounding this hidden pyramid. I haven't gone into any detail of the plot for two reasons: (1)many other reviewers have already done so and (2)the plot is so ridiculous that any real scrutiny would be more enlightening than anything that happened in the film. Is ALien Vs. Predator entertaining? Yes, it is - like many accidents are. It has just enough going for it to keep the viewer engaged but never really satisfied.",4,3,6,16 May 2005
Batman Begins," Delightfully Dark
","Director Christopher Nolan pulls out all the stops as he embarks on solidifying Batman lore with his retelling of how one Bruce Wayne became the capped crusader Batman. Nolan dazzles in many scenes and is always rock solid, never resorting to cheap humor or unnecessary special effects. This Batman is a dark tale that explains why Batman is the person he is, why he became the person he was to be, and what lies ahead. Christian Bales does a credible job in the lead. He is surrounded by first-rate performers lending their experience and acting savvy: Michael Caine as Alfred(very, very good), Morgan Freeman as Luscious(very, very good), Gary Oldman as policeman Gordon(very good) and villains Liam Neeson(very good), the ever impressive Tom Wilkinson(excellent), and Cillian Murphy(very good). Rutger Hauer is also along as is Katie Holmes(big deal huh?) I really enjoyed this film and was impressed with its cohesiveness and strong script. The script, the direction, the acting, the sets, and the special effects all blend together and make a fine film and probably the definitive Batman film to date. I know many people will compare this to the two Burton films - both good films in their own way. But this Batman is not that Batman. There are no one-liners here and there mixed in with an occasional over-blown scene. This film is a very serious take on a very serious man that has devoted his life to stopping crime in Gotham.",7,5,7,29 October 2005
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," My Vote for Best Film of 2012!
","Lots of division here - actually I am very surprised. I am not going into some long review. MANY on here have done so. I loved the movie and, after seeing most of the films nominated for an Oscar in 2012, was very perplexed why this one had not even been nominated. To me, it clearly was the best. Yes, I have read The Hobbit many times. Yes, Peter Jackson changed and heavily 'added' but in the end he crafted a masterpiece - and I for one longingly await the second installment. Could this have been done in two movies? Sure. But it was not. At least you are getting your money's worth with these films. The action, story, acting, special effects, music, etc.. are all top-notch. That is all I have to say now - I told you I would be brief.",Null,1,4,20 July 2013
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Entertaining Sequel If Nothing Else
","Certainly The Lost World is worlds behind Jurassic Park in terms of film-making.  Yet, it is an entertaining film.  That is, however, really all it has going for it though.  Steven Spielberg again directs humans and computer-enhanced dinos not just on a dinosaur island but also through the streets of San Diego.  The biggest problem with this film is the script which is very shallow.  Whereas in the first film, the viewer could relate a bit to some of the characters and the characters had some depth(albeit not a lot granted), the characters in this film have no depth at all.  We are merely given one-sided stereotypes of certain types of characters.  Jeff Goldblum is back as Ian Malcolm, but his character was one-sided in the first film.  Goldblum does, however, add some much needed humour to the film, but his character just isn't the strong lead type.  Nor is his girlfriend played by Julianne Moore as a determined paleontologist.  She has zero depth. The list goes on:  Arliss Howard as the greedy tycoon, Richard Attenbourough as the befuddled old man with a heart of good intentions, and so on and so on.  The best character for me easily was the great hunter played by Pete Posthlethwaite as Roland Tembo.  Just when you think he is nothing but a cardboard character, he shows some signs of having a personality.  A nice performance too by a very under-rated Posthlethwaite. The most ridiculous character is Vanessa Lee Chester as Ian Malcom's pint-sized daughter who wows dinos with her gymnastics.  Whew!  What a stinker of a scene!  But acting and writing aside, the film does have the same kind of wonderful special effects and held my attention for two hours. That means, if nothing else, it was entertaining.",Null,0,1,26 July 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," First-Rate Fare
","A splendid continuation of Tolkien's magical trilogy is again brought to the screen by Peter Jackson.  Jackson, certainly deserving an oscar either this year or next, once again displays his directorial adeptness by faithfully following the text, bringing difficult characters and subject matter to life, and producing wonderful screen images of beauty and terror.  This second installment, generally what I have always considered the weakest of the books, is brought to life with more gusto and life than the first one, which had the onerous yet necessary chore of exposition and characterization on its shoulders.  I briefly glanced through the reviews and saw some people post negative reviews because they are not intelligent enough - or only functionally literate - having trouble understanding the story.  It is complicated and certainly having read the books prior to seeing the film is a huge bonus.  Nonetheless, if one watches the Fellowship a few times, the plot should become very apparent.  The acting in this film is first-rate, and John Rys-Davies as the dwarf Gimli really shines with his humourous interpretation.  Mckellan is again in this film, yet his role is small in comparison to the first outing.  He DESERVED the oscar for that performance. What's not to like about this film?  It has incredible special effects, great character acting, beautiful cinematography, and one heck of a story!",Null,0,0,28 December 2002
The Incredibles," That's Incredible...Sure It Must Have Been Used...But I'm Feeling Lazy!
","What could I possibly add to any discussion of The Incredibles? Its popularity is worldwide, and its critical success sewed up with an Oscar. It is an incredible movie in many ways. It has some crazy, innovative animation that will leave your jaw dropping at times. It has some humorous looks at humanity that few films explore. It is in every sense a family film when so many pretend to be just that. But is it THAT incredible? Don't get me wrong. I loved the film. I thought how clever this was and all that, but I wasn't bowled over like I had been when I saw Finding Nemo...or Shrek...or even Shrek 2 or Shark Tale. It must be me. I thought the film was very good...even excellent...but not the best. The story was just not strong enough for me nor were the characters as to give them that kind of attention. The family members...and I am not going to give a general overview of plot when so many have done so...were interesting characters but when separated had little of the specialness of other animated characters when standing alone. I guess if you wanted Dora in Nemo or the Donkey in Shrek to do a film as the focal characters - they might be able to carry a film on their narrow shoulders (or fins) if possible. Would any of these characters be able to do that? Let's face it the most interesting character was the crazy, short costume designer(an obvious and funny homage to the late, great Edith Head). I thought the villain in particular was very weak. I'm not panning the film. It is a great animated film and is very funny and so on. I just don't know if it has earned all the praise lavished on it. Anyway, I want to recommend this film as a fun film and definitely as a fun FAMILY film. Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunetr, especially Samuel Jackson as Frozone, and all the rest do a great job suiting their voices to characters and breathing life into this animated classic. (Yes, I did like the film.)",8,1,3,30 March 2005
Stardust," This Star Shines Brightly
","Highly enjoyable, very imaginative, and filmic fairytale all rolled into one, Stardust tells the story of a young man living outside a fantasy world going inside it to retrieve a bit of a fallen star only to find the star is alive, young, and beautiful. A kingdom whose king is about to die has said king unleash a competition on his several sons to see who can retrieve a ruby first to be king whilst a trio of witches want the star to carve up and use to keep them young. These three plot threads weave intricately together throughout the entire picture blended with good acting, dazzling special effects, and some solid sentiment and humour as well. Stardust is a fun film and has some fun performances from the likes of Claire Danes as the star(I could gaze at her for quite some time) to Michelle Pfeiffer(I could gaze at her at full magical powers even longer) playing the horrible witch to Robert Deniro playing a nancy-boy air pirate to perfection. Charlie Cox as the lead Tristan is affable and credible and we get some very good work from a group of guys playing the sons out to be king who are constantly and consistently trying to kill off each other. Mark Strong, Jason Flemyng, and Ruppert Everett plays their roles well in both life and death(loved this whole thread as well). Peter O'Toole plays the dying killer daddy and watch for funny man Ricky Gervais who made me laugh more than anything in the entire film in his brief five minutes(nice feet). But the real power in the film is the novel by Neil Gaiman and the script made from his creative and fertile mind. Stardust creates its own mythology and its own world and it works.",9,2,3,22 July 2009
The Elephant Man," Cinematic Verse
","The trials and tribulations of the elephant man, John Merrick, are ably exploited in this Mel Brook's produced film directed with style, insight into character, and humanity by David Lynch.  The film is a masterpiece of scenes that are woven together to display the polarization of humanity from the brute carnival 'owner' of Merrick, the night porter that brings drunken friends to see the 'hideous' nature of this sideshow sight, and all the other uncaring, unfeeling people in the world that show nothing but contempt for someone that is markedly different to the other side of a doctor that genuinely cares for Merrick, a hospital administrator and staff that work to make life easier for their patient, and an actress and her society friends that show compassion and friendliness towrd this physical deformity.  The Elephant Man is made in black and white, and this move is a stroke of genius as it is exactly the right medium to show the seediness of like in Victorian London.   No colorful streets laden with shopkeepers and the like as you might find in an adaptation of a Dickens work or a Sherlock Holmes film. Here we see the brutality of existence.  The drunken jobless people who delight in watching physical perversity.  The soot-covered streets lined with thieves and other denizens of law-breakers.  Lynch creates a film that can terrify you by showing us a side of humanity that we know is there.  He makes us not very proud to be a human being i his portrayal of the harsh, cruel treatment of David Merrick.  But humanity prevails in the end.....and Merrick's situation is resolved with dignity if nothing else.  I loved this film.  The acting is superb.  John Hurt gives easily his best performance as a man fraught with physical degredation and societal humiliation.  Hurt brings so much heart to his role that only the most cold-hearted will not be affected.  Anthony Hopkins gives another restrained yet brilliant performance as the doctor responsible for bringing Merrick to the hospital. Other notable performances come from Freddie Jones as a brutish master of Merrick, Wendy Hiller as a hospital matron, and a real nice performance from John Geilgud as the head of the hospital.  Each of his scenes is a showcase for his incredible acting ability.  The Elephant Man was very deserved of winning an oscar for best picture.  It's that good!",Null,2,2,27 January 2002
I Am Legend," Not the Stuff That Legends Are Made Of
","I wholeheartedly agree with many other reviewers that as pure entertainment goes, I Am Legend is fine - just fine to be more accurate. It is compelling enough to keep you on the edge of your seat, the CGI and visuals are impressive, Will Smith is Will Smith, and the story generates just enough of a comparison with the great apocalyptic novel I Am Legend by Richard Matheson to be engaging. It is very short for a movie that could have been much more in depth. Character depth is missing. Story depth is missing. Thematic depth is missing. Yes, we get the action scenes. Yes, we get Smith being charming and glib. Yes, we get high tech gadgetry and big box office sensibilities. Yawn. This film could COULD have been so much more than what it is. As it is it is marginal entertainment, but had it really taken Matheson's novel and based its screenplay in a more committed manner to it - the film could have been entertaining and profound. Why so short? Why the dog in the beginning of the film? Why the high-tech crap - to cover up the glaring weaknesses in plot and character depth no doubt. Don't get me wrong - I enjoyed the film enough so that I would definitely see it again. But having read the book and knowing what could have been done is the most supreme disappointment. The book could be easily transformed to film page by page. Of course you would forfeit action chase sequences and big budget gloss. But the book had a theme of one man against the undying void of loneliness that comes with being the very last man on Earth. That never happens here as we have a dog with Robert Neville immediately and soon...well, you'll see. The story was done twice before with Vincent Price in The Last Man on Earth and Charlton Heston in The Omega Man. This one is about as good as those two - though as far as story integrity goes - I'll take The Last Man on Earth as a better realization of what Matheson achieved in prose.",6,1,3,6 April 2008
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Night Time in the City
","Milla Jovovich is back as Alice in this pedestrian sequel to a pedestrian original. Alice breaks from her hibernation to walk into Raccoon City amidst all the turmoil going on in a city ravaged by a disease turning the dead into fighting machines. The Umbrella Corporation manages to close the city gates and has plans to test its newest creation/invention/experiment Nemesis. What takes place? You know the drill: lots of killing, outlandish, excessive special effects, lots of high kicks and stand offs between Nemesis and Alice, Diogenes holding a lantern looking for a real actor and coming up short, and the thinnest, most threadbare plot imaginable. I didn't like Resident Evil uno, and I found dos to be void of any of the few merits the first one was able to extol. At least in the first one, director Paul Anderson was able to create some menace and mood - as if a real threat was going on. This director, Alexander Witt, fails to achieve that. This film is loaded with clichés from the opening scene to the very end. I again will say that it has a nice look to it but is void of any, and I mean any, real substance whatsoever. Not letting Anderson off to lightly, he wrote this vacuum of thought.",2,2,6,30 March 2005
The Evil Dead," Fair...Not My Cup of Tea
","I cannot add anything new to the critique of this film.  I can praise the inventive camera work by Sam Raimi.  It is outstanding.  I can commend the production for its ability to use what little financial resources were available to their fullest.  The film is effective in that it does create some good, honest scares.  It utilizes some interesting special effects hitherto not seen in film.  Bruce Campbell is very good in his role, and the other actors are not too terrible till make-up gets hold of them.  Some of the night sequences are very chilling and atmospheric as well.  But(and you probably knew this was coming)the film is wildly overrated as some kind of cinematic masterpiece.  It is NO masterpiece.  It is your basic take some teenagers out into the woods, let them play with black magic, and finally kill them off in crude ways.  This is one gory, unrealistic film.  That's fine if that is what you like.  But I found myself yawning in some stretches through the repeated, pointless, senseless, brutal gore.  And let's talk logic...at one point one demon-faced girl is knocking wildly on the door to get to Mr. Campbell...while only several feet down is a window that had its glass smashed in.  She got something against windows?  Evil Dead is not a bad picture.  For its type, it is very good, but when you get right down to it...it's not my cup of tea to see so much violence with almost no exposition.  I need a story with a little meat, not a lot of butchered meat and little story.",4,3,8,28 June 2001
From Dusk Till Dawn," Not Your Average Mexican Hay-ride
","Although I am not AS lovestruck with this film as many other reviewers are, I did find it an entertaining albeit conscience-churning experience.  From Dusk Till Dawn really is two films in one.  The first part tells the story of the Gecko boys(Not Geico) played by George Clooney and Quentin Tarentino. They are escapees from the law and have killed over a dozen people brutally already by the time the film opens.  For me, this tale of how they kill a gas station guy and finally abduct a preacher and his two children for their RV is the most chilling part of the film.  Clooney plays a guy with little moral conscience well.  Tarentino does a good job too and you can see his wit throughout the script.  I found both men very despicable, so I guess the acting was good.  The film falls into parody/farce, however, once the the whole gang(the two Geckos and the preacher and his daughter and son)reach a strip club/bar out in the middle of nowhere in Mexico.  What happens here, to the uninformed viewer, will be totally unexpected.  Does it work?  To a degree, however, the film really loses momentum and credibility it might have had.  The acting in general is all acceptable.  Harvey Keitel once again shows us why he is such a good actor.  Juliette Lewis is also very good in her role as his daughter.  Nice to see guys like Tom Savini and Fred Williamson too.  Oh, and Salma Hayek IS the highlight of the film.",Null,34,38,31 July 2001
The Dark Knight," Truly NoJoke - This Is a Very Good Movie!
","The Dark Knight, the follow-up to Christopher Nolan's first Batman movie Batman Begins, is a very satisfying sequel and in many ways a much better film. Christain Bale again returns as the caped crusader Batman/Bruce Wayne and so do all the regulars like Michael Caine as Alfred, Morgan Freeman as Luscious, and Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon. Katie Holmes is replaced by Maggie Gyllenhaal as the 'love interest' so to speak. New are Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent - a new DA out to rid Gotham of its scum and a new villain - the Joker this time round. The late Heath Ledger plays the Joker with an incredible range and he is evil, twisted, psychotic, and even at times subtle. Ledger plays the arch-enemy strictly seriously rather than for any cheap, easy laughs such as Jack Nicholson did in Tim Burton's Batman. Though Nicholson did a great job, he is vastly over-powered by Ledger's work in this film with the same role. The Dark Knight has it all: good, solid if not inspired acting, some fantastic chase scenes, new technological gadget wizardry, dark, foreboding atmosphere, and, for extra measure, a few morals and lessons thrown somewhere into the pot(though not as easy to discern as many would like to believe). The story gets a bit long-winded in the final third of the film, but the loose ends are tied well and Episode Three is given its introduction briefly. It looks like Nolan surely has a winner with this franchise and I look forward to more of the same with eager anticipation.",9,3,8,26 December 2008
The Mummy Returns," Lost Magic
","I awaited the sequel to the smash hit The Mummy with great anticipation.  I thought the first movie was action-packed and possessed a great deal of charisma.  It was one of the films that I found hard not to like.  What happened in the sequel?  Where was that same magic?  Gone.  I sat through this film of contrived plot sequences, almost non-existent character development, and machine gun special effects and wished it would end soon. Literally, I could not wait till the ending.  The film was nothing but one special effect after another.  It had no real plot.  But worst of all, it lacked likable characters that populated the first film and gave it its charm.  Brandon Fraser was still here, but he just seemed too rushed to be funny.  The effects were crowding his comic style.  Rachel Weisz, who had an undeniable likability in the first film because of her awkwardness and shy demeanor, is transformed into a supermodel-archaeologist.  She looks like she just got out of a hair salon as she journeys through the Egyptian desert.  The background story is weak, and obviously an excuse to bring back characters from the first film(too bad they could not bring back Bernard Fox or Kevin O'Connor from the first film!).  Director Stephen Sommers really plays and panders to a far-less intelligent crowd in this one.  And that's too bad.  Instead of building on to something interesting and unique, he creates one cliche of a film with everything from the little boy who is smarter than his parents to the resorting to two scantily clad females in a cat-fight like sequence.  A big disappointment!",Null,1,3,19 November 2001
Drag Me to Hell," Old-Fashioned Horror Returns
","It was a pleasant surprise to see this film go back to some of the earlier methods of scaring an audience: the use of the power of suggestion, imagination over visualization, leads that have acting talent, and a story(though cliché-riddled) offered more than a one punch game plan. Drag Me to Hell is not great but highly enjoyable for those reasons plus it is stylish as well. The opening scene in the film grabs you initially and then we enter into the life of a female banker who makes a mistake with an old gypsy woman who is being thrown out of her house. Events turn far worse as a curse reeks its arsenal of evil on this girl. The acting in this film really is pretty good. Alison Lohman does a fine job as the protagonist. She is able to show a range of emotions believably. Justin Long is also pretty good as her boyfriend. The character actors are all solid with Dillep Rao as an Indian palm reader shining(and adding a subtle dose of humour), Adriana Barazza as a mystic, and in a stellar part of disgusting special effects and over-acting Lorna Raver as Sylvia Ganush the gypsy woman. The tension stays taut throughout. We see little but imagine lots. The film does have some obvious flaws. The end can be seen miles away. i knew how it was going to end and what the 'trick' ending was going to be. I thought it might throw out a trickier trick ending - but it did not. The fight scene in the car was also way over-the-top - more so than anything els in the film. That notwithstanding, Drag Me to Hellw was a pleasant diversion and a throwback to a more intelligent type of horror made.",7,1,3,15 November 2009
The Fly," It Sure Isn't Your Grandfather's Fly
","David Cronenberg makes a somewhat faithful, yet completely stirring remake of the ultimate insect movie - The Fly. I really enjoyed this movie because of its suspenseful storytelling, ability to make you care about the characters, wonderful if not over-the-top special effects, and Cronenberg's obvious touches dealing with nature and man's interference with it. Jeff Goldblum does a very workmanlike job playing a scientist trying to work out the bugs(OK, an obvious pun) with his work in teleportation - very much like the protagonist in the original Fly. Apart from the work and the mix up with the fly when sending himself, there are very few comparisons between this film and the original. I like both versions as entities unto themselves and do not think that any grand comparison between the two is necessary or even warranted because of the completely different natures of the plot. Goldblum, having won the affections of Amazon beauty intensified in Geena Davis, sends himself when inebriated. He soon starts to exhibit characteristics that ultimately make him discover he has fly DNA mixed with his own. He starts to have fibrous hairs grow from his back, an insatiable appetite for sweets, and soon can climb walls. Davis watches by as her lover slowly decays. At the heart of all this terrible affair dealing with Goldblum transforming into a human fly is a love story between Goldblum and Davis. It is touchingly done considering its backdrop and Cronenberg behind the camera. Don't expect the fly to look anything like the classic fly of the fifties - this one is completely different. David Cronenberg once again shows us why he is one of the best in the genre. He wrote this creative script and directs with style that is undeniably David Cronenberg. Certainly this is one of the greatest horror remakes of all time and one of the best horror films of that otherwise barren decade - the 1980s.",9,2,3,2 April 2005
Thor," This Time Frosty Reception Is Good
","Visually striking, generally well-directed, competently performed super-hero epic made with state of the art CGI effects. Norse mythology via Marvel comics and Stan Lee are brought to life here. While not your typical Marvel comic 'epic' - Thor spends most of its time in the world of Thor, Odin, Loke, and Frost Giants - a banished race. The story was inventive and conceived imaginatively. Anthony Hopkins does a great job playing Odin and relative newcomer Chris Hemsworth makes an appealing Thor, even an affable one for guys as well as girls. The rest of the cast was judiciously cast. As Loki, the villain of the film, Tom Hiddleston stands out. Beautiful Natalie Portman plays the female love-interest. Veteran, and a good character actor, Stellan Skarsgard plays a pivotal role as well. i liked really most of what I saw. Director Kenneth Branagh does a serviceable job with the material - and adds some class to this Marvel addition. you are given clues throughout that The Avengers is on its way.",7,3,6,27 October 2012
Zombieland," 'Any Regrets...Garfield, Maybe'
","Fast-paced from beginning to end, Zombieland defies what has been done with zombies beforehand and goes for the laughs in the same way if not the same manner as films like Shaun of the Dead. Jesse Eisenberg plays the narrator and lead as a young man ripped from his humdrum life to follow a code of rules he has developed in order to survive the zombie holocaust. Throughout the film we are reminded of his rules, his fears, his phobias, and his thoughts in a most humorous way. He ends up teaming with wild and crazy guy Woody Harrelson(who is always good with these kinds of roles)and later with hot Emma Stone and her sister(in film) Abagail Breslin. Thefour shoot, hack, bludgeon, etc... zombies along the way to California as the young girl wants to see the Pacific Play Park(something like that) from her youth. The characters are known from the cities they are from and I found the film's script to be rather witty and disgustingly funny throughout even though there really, on the surface, is not a lot to work with in terms of plot structure. About halfway in the film a cameo of a major star comes up and it IS the highlight of the film. It is incredibly humorous and the guest star does his level best to be self-deprecating as well as amusing. Director Ruben Fleisher shows he has a future with his directorial flair and ability to care for characters even in a funny film like this. There are so many good, solid laughs that come from all kinds of sources and types of humor that this one does not just rely on the 'beat' a dead zombie up to a pulp mentality. I thoroughly enjoyed Zombieland - especially the climatic end. Despite the comedic intent the film obviously has, there are some truly scary moments as well, and I found myself jumping out of the seat a time or two. Even regular horror films today don't often do that for me. I guess part of it deals withe the ability to create suspense, the care we have invested in the characters, and, perhaps most importantly, there is more here than just death and killing and none of them over the death bloody(the beginning credits being the exception).",7,1,3,10 October 2010
Psycho," Very Deserved of Such High Praise
","The story of the motel owner with a split personality is part of our American culture.  Everyone is familiar with the famous shower scene. Bernard Herrmann's score evokes memories and moods instantly.  Psycho is a film masterpiece.  It is a wonderfully chilly tale of sexual repression, of madness, of the effects that living alone can have on an individual, and finally on the rural aspects of horror in the life of rural America.  It is a cheaply made film, but accomplishes so much with so little.  The credit goes to a handful of people.  First and foremost in this group stands the master of suspense himself, Alfred Hitchcock.  It is Hitchcock's best film in terms of utilizing the minimal for the most shocking scenes ever filmed. His shower scene is forever etched into the mindset of people all over the world.  When the film came out, people were afraid to take showers afterward for quite awhile.  The camera lens sets the pace for the film, and my favourite scene is Janet Leigh driving in the car.  Extremely well-shot scenes with a steady current of tension.  Hitchcock was ably assisted by all concerned.  Herrmann's score is awesome.  Joseph Stefano did a wonderful job adapting the wonderful novel by horror legend Robert Bloch.  The acting is first-rate.  Anthony Perkins did such a good job that he never could escape the role of Norman Bates.  Martin Balsam, Vera Miles, even John Gavin do credible jobs.  Janet Leigh is very good, and looks quite fetching and provocative in a black brassiere.  Watch for cameos by Simon Oakland(from The Night Stalker fame) and Ted Knight as a guard.  An incredible film in many ways - not least of which is the incredible legacy the film has acheived in our cultural panorama.",10,0,0,6 September 2001
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Desperately Needs a Diet Pill
","Bloated. That is the one word I think accurately describes this cinematic experience. Michael Bay, a director of some talent and a filmmaker with credits like The Rock, Bad Boys, and the first Transformers film, goes out of control here with the special effects and opens one big can of cheese as story, logic, acting, and character development take the back seat - in a bus! The story is so convoluted and so ludicrous that I defy anyone to tell me that he/she really understood all that was going on, because it is clear the director and the actors haven't a clue. There is no way a child sitting through this maze of machines forming, transforming, and uttering ridiculous dialog would be able at any point to tell you what was going on AND why it was going on. That is how little time is devoted to exposition. Odd you might think considering the film is two and a half hours long! I am not one of those people that hates long movies - I only am bothered by them when they feel like long movies. This one felt like three or four hours long. I kept thinking to myself when will this mess end. Look, for those of you wanting to see the special effects. There is no way you will be disappointed. I need more of that. If you want sophomoric dialog, juvenile situations, and Megan Fox in huggingly tight shorts and white jeans - you are in luck too. If you want character acting devoid of logic with Kevein Dunn and Julie White playing Shia's parents like they were in an over-acting concert or Ramon Rodriguez hamming it up with a butt roast rather than slices - then you are in luck. I found few bright spots in this film for me. I need something more than one scene after another of mindless transforming and one-liners meant to be funny to a quasi-literate adolescent. The first film, also directed by Bay, was more of that. It was by no means a great film, but it was entertaining and did spend oodles more time in development of plot and characters. This film tries to feed off that development but fails miserably because those plot elements and characters were not wholly formed. Maybe I am getting all bent out of shape for nothing more than what this film was supposed to be - but I have seen it done better - even by this director who excels in that kind of film. The brightest spots for me were Rainn Wilson in a cameo as a professor with a great opening in a class and John Turturro reprising his role with much less dignity but nevertheless some acting skill.",4,0,4,8 November 2009
Rosemary's Baby," One of the Best!
","Undoubtedly, this film is certainly one of the best horror/suspense films ever made.  It is a chilling psycho-drama, a social commentary, and a good old-fashioned horror yarn all at once.  The story, of course, concerns a young Rosemary Woodhouse and her husband's journey in becoming tenants of a huge Brownstone called the Bram, where many evil, mysterious things have happened to/with its tenants over its long history.  The story unfolds, and we are caught up in what Rosemary sees, hears, and even thinks.  We feel her pain, anxiety, paranoia, and even fear.  We sense conspiracy all around us and want nothing more than security for her and her child to come.  This is due in large part to the masterful direction of one of the greatest directors of the screen...Roman Polanski.  Polanski shows us just enough and lets are imaginations kick in and conceive the horrors around us as only are minds can conjure.  The acting is extremely good in this film and it is in many ways a character actor's dream.  Ruth Gordon deservedly won an oscar for her portrayal of the nosy, loquacious Minnie Castavet.  Sidney Blackmer, playing her husband, also is equally good as an elderly man seemingly polite and good-natured but seething with hatred, evil, and delight in the pain of others.  Ralph Bellamy, Patsy Kelly, and Maurice Evans are also memorable in their roles.  Mia Farrow is very convincing as is her husband John Cassavetes.  William Castle, the great showman of the movies, produced this gem, and unquestionably it was his greatest collaborative effort. First-rate direction, top-notch acting, one heck of a good script based on Ira Levin's masterpiece of simplicity in story-telling all lead to one heck of a good film!",10,3,4,19 September 1999
War of the Worlds," Closer to the Book
","I have a very fond place in my heart for George Pal's The War of the Worlds made during the golden age of science fiction. I was somewhat apprehensive upon hearing a remake was in the works, but many of my fears were allayed hearing the film would be directed by none other than Stevin Spielberg. Well, overall, this remake was a quality film yet I have some ambivalent feelings toward it. Spielberg does what he does best: lots of great suspense and solid storytelling, awesome, state-of-the-art special effects, wonderful music by John Williams, and an outwardly satisfying film...for the most part. Actually, this film was somewhat of a letdown for me. Now before you misunderstand, I did think it was a decent film. It was definitely much closer to the spirit of the book. The special effects...WOW! When you see the spaceships and the Martians, they look stunning and horrifying. I also like the way that Spielberg stays in touch with the common man rather than, say the president ala Independence Day(a film I ultimately enjoyed more). What I didn't take to was the kids as protagonists again...a typical Spielberg device but one that really doesn't work nearly as well in this film. Dakota Fanning as Rachel does a serviceable job in a rather stereotypical role as the frightened out of her wits pre-adolescent. Justin Chatwin; however, as the obnoxious, rebellious teen at odds with a father he feels antipathy for is far less satisfying. I didn't like the kid at all. Tom Cruise is acceptable at best...and really that is rather generous. Spielberg might have added a bit more depth to these characters. And I really am puzzled at Spielberg's use of the two stars from the original Pal film: Gene Barry and Ann Robinson. If you blink, you will miss them. They are not even on screen three seconds. C'mon Steve. Couldn't you give them just a bit more screen time? With what they have, you might have well not used them at all.But these acting concerns aside for a film effects oriented, this remake is a quality film but definitely not one of its director's best.",6,0,1,11 August 2005
30 Days of Night," Don't Give It the Cold Shoulder
","Okay, yes, this is a seemingly big-budgeted horror film(this distinction makes it greatly differ from another big-budgeted film)with loads of blood, guts, unsavory acts of violence toward women and children, and an incomprehensible script if one is looking for any dose of realism at all. Look but in vain for ye shall not find it. What we do know is that Barrow, Alaska, a town in the northernmost part of North America, has a period of one month where it is blanketed in total darkness - 30 days of darkness with no sunlight(just in case the concept was too complex I explained it at its most fundamental level here - kidding of course!). For some unexplained and not-so-inexplicable reason, a horde of foreign-sounding vampires descend on the town as soon as the first day of darkness ensues. What we get then is a period of non-stop hunting - vampires are the hunters and a rag-tag group of Alaskans who chose not to go somewhere else for this period become the prey. We get your usual suspects here. The town sheriff and the girl he broke up with thrust together under bad circumstances. Josh Hartnett and Melissa George play the couple with some conviction. But let's make no mistake, this is not a character driven piece by any standard. We get the crazed loner who rides a bulldozer and several other weird townsfolk we have seen prototypes of for years in film. The vampires look less than impressive and speak some alien language, and the film is decidedly grim with regard to violence and how it is shown. Though I would not recommend this film to the casual horror enthusiast for that specific reason, I did enjoy the film - flaws and all - for its fast-paced action and use of setting as a means of creating mood, theme, and plot in such a refreshing way. The story is wildly inconsistent and the acting mediocre at best, but director David Slade has just enough juice in other ways to make the film work for me in many ways. This is not a real good film nor is it a good film like more mainstream horror pictures you might see - but it is a reminder of the trend of horror today of being graphic, cold, dispassionate, and dehumanizing. It also shows how action and horror - like in Aliens for example - can be fused and work on some level.",6,1,2,1 June 2008
Army of Darkness," Bones, Books, and Campbell
","Highly enjoyable, fairly mindless, funny addition to Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series - the third and last installment and easily the best and most engaging of the three as well. Bruce Campbell is back with a slightly different character motivation and past, but Campbell relies on his quick reflexes, both physical and mental, that made him famous in the first two Evil Dead movies as Ash and kicks it up not just a notch but three or four. Here he is obviously parodizing his character and those of adventure/horror films of the era. He is a walking one-liner amidst hokey plot contrivances, imaginative special effects(for its time bear in mind), and some pretty mediocre acting talents. But none of that really matters because Campbell and Raimi are out to make you laugh and Army of Darkness is no more a horror film than Fatal Attraction is a romantic comedy. Raimi is agile and adroit with the camera and innovative. I really liked the walking skeletons in the battle scenes, and Raimi gives them ludicrous lines to say to make sure no one confuses this with anything more than what it is intended to be. Campbell shines as he always does as a bigger-than-life persona with lots of comedic ability. The scene with the books was a real hoot as were his multiple fights with various demons. Though part of the Evil Dead series, this really has virtually nothing to do with the other two except for some names that are the same and some plot elements that allow Campbell to run, shout, contort himself in most amusing ways.",6,0,3,2 March 2008
Scream 2," Film Planted Firmly in Cheek
","Wes Craven is back again at the helm of Scream 2, his followup to the mega-successful Scream. As sequels go, one could do a lot worse than this film. Sure, it has a pretty silly story trying desperately to cling to the original source material, but it never ever takes the story too terribly serious. How does Craven do this? He laces the film with all kinds of film references and humour directly tied to the film industry and actors involved. Several mentions of 'Friends' cast members abound whilst having Courtney Cox return in her signature role as Gail Weathers. Craven also brings back the rules to horror films - now horror sequels; these rules are right on mark too(wish we had heard the most important!). In fact my favourite scene in the whole movie is in a classroom where students debate the inferior sequel to the superior original. Excellent examples are given to support one argument that sequels are better: Aliens and Terminator 2, and of course, The Godfather 2. Naturally this small cross section seems great when none of the hundreds of truly bad sequels are mentioned. Purposely I am sure! Is Scream 2 better than Scream? No way. It doesn't have nearly as much punch to it. The opening scene this time takes place in a movie theater, but it is not as powerful as the opening scene with Drew Barrymore in the original. The story is really something unto itself as well...but any kind of examination of plot other than a cursory one would give too much away. Not that that would be any great pity. I did like the acting in this one more. Arquette returns as Dewey affecting some kind of limp and pinched nerve in hand. He does a fairly nice job. Cox is lovely as ever and also is good in her role. Campbell is OK, as is the rest of the cast with Jamie Kennedy again standing out as nerdy movie maven Randy Weeks and, in particular, Liev Screiber doing a wonderful job as Cotton Weary(the man who had been accused of killing Sidney's mama). This sequel has more blood, more deaths, and more jokes. Like the original, I too enjoyed this film for its entertainment value if nothing else.",6,18,32,15 January 2005
The Green Mile," The Mouse That Lived...and Lived...and Lived
","Don't take the naysayers of this film too seriously.  Their general lack of movie knowledge is apparent when they say this film is cliched, paper-thin, etc...   This is an incredible film on so many levels.  I know much has been written, expressed, and analyzed about this film here, and so with that I will add my own brief observations.  The directing is top-notch.  Three hours slips by like half that time because of the suspense and general aura created in the film.  The performances are all wonderful  Sure, Tom Hanks does a great job, but how bout guys like David Morse, Michael Jeter(an incredible performance), Sam Rockwell, Doug Hutchinson(a guy you will just love to hate), and the rock solid acting of Michael Clarke Duncan.  The period pieces are extensive, yet they are able to make this very realistic setting become something magical at the same time.  I really cannot say much more except that at the core of this film is the notion of people helping people.  A good core if ever there was one.  If you have not seen The Green Mile...do so...I think you will be pleasantly pleased.",Null,1,2,22 July 2001
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A Rousing Good Film!
","George Lucas saved his best for last - at least that can be said with no doubt for the second trilogy he put together. Revenge of the Sixth expertly weaves together a story that brings closure to the first three sagas of Star Wars and leaves a window open for the next three(those previously made decades ago). The line binding the two - save for obvious technological differences - is almost seamless. Everything of pertinent nature is explained, characters are set up to correspond with future actions, and the theme of the force vs. the dark side is as strong as ever. The dazzling CGI special effects of this film dominate a large portion of this film's success. They are most impressive(as they have been throughout the entire trilogy). Lucas directs with his usual abilities to 'tell' a good story visually. The acting is generally very good with some very worthy performances. Ian McDiarmind, one of a handful of actors to appear in ALL six films, steals each of his scenes and gives his best performance on screen. Definitely an Oscar-worthy nod! McGregor and Portman do very credible jobs again. Hayden Christiansen, though no great thespian, does better this time round. But acting aside, the film is carried by story and special effects and by one's memories of what is to take place in Staw Wars(1977). For me, Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith is a very rewarding experience in that regard. One scene in particular summed up all those feelings...seeing Wayne Pygram - not even uttering a word and having less screen time than 30 seconds - standing there looking out in space with his sallow, sunken cheekbones as the young Moff Tarkin. He is the spitting image of the late, great Peter Cushing. Christopher Lee has a short reprisal as Count Dooku in the beginning of the film, and, in a way - if one really stretches things, it is like Lee and Cushing had one more film to share their names in the credits. But nostalgia notwithstanding, see Revenge of the Sith for the story, the special effects, McDiarmind's performance, and for closure of a kind.",8,2,5,4 July 2005
Scream," A Classic?
","Director Wes Craven almost singlehandedly resurrected the horror genre in the mid 90's with this film. Prior to Scream the 90's and the entire 80's had been decades with tireless and tiresome retreads of once popular horror films. These films adhered to the same formula, had little or no innovative or imaginative ideas, and were filled with empty-headed teens big on looks and almost totally void of any real talent. Craven adheres to many of these notions as well in Scream, but he is always using them in a self-mocking way. Scream has much going for it as a horror film: one of the best opening sequences of any horror film with the subtraction of star Drew Barrymore very quickly, some genuine thrills and chills as well as some genuine laughs, and a constant homage to the genre with references such as Wes Carpenter as a popular director of the day and the rules that one should learn having watched horror films. Craven even manages to insert a clip of Whale's Frankenstein for good measure. BUT...and you might have guessed this was coming...I get real disheartened when so many people say this is a classic, one of the greatest horror films ever made(if not the greatest itself), or even Craven's finest film. It just isn't so. I would not even imagine any scenario where I would put Scream on my top ten...top twenty...top thirty... greatest horror film list. Great horror films have great scripts. Scream does not. Aside from the roller coaster introduction with Barrymore, the film never manages to reach those same heights. There are a lot of good plot twists, but let's face it - the story is pretty preposterous. Great horror films usually have great actors giving great performances. Scream does not have any great performances. The cast does a nice job smiling through much of the film - even in the face of impending death. As an audience we are never asked to take anyone seriously. And as an audience we don't. Great horror films have great, memorable scenes that linger with the viewer. Scream DOES have some of these. the opening is very effective. Craven deserves a lot of credit for it, but it is never rivaled again in the film. Don't get me wrong - I liked Scream. It was a fun movie. It gave me a few reasons to jump from my seat. It made me laugh here and there. But it never left any long-lasting impression on me that I had just sat through a masterpiece like when I first saw Psycho, Rosemary's Baby, or Carpenter's Halloween. Craven is a good director and has made many good films. I like his 70's work best: Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes(films that may well repulse many viewers but left a lasting impression on me, though most of it was pure shock!). Those films are really better than this film. Craven plays up to a modern audience whom he is making fun of indirectly in the film. He laces the film with all kinds of genre references that most of his younger, hip audience will have no understanding of at all. He tells us that those people in horror films that have sex or drink or take drugs will die. He shows his audience exactly what they want to see and then pokes fun at it. Surely this hip approach has a lot to do with the wide accolades the film has received from its loyal audience over the years. I think Scream, though not a great film, deservedly is due recognition for making horror popular again and mainstream. This mainstream approach has led to many new, innovative horror films since its release and has made the horror genre certainly one of the more profitable genres to produce a film for. Yes, we still have the umpteenth sequels and unnecessary remakes, but there have also been some new films that I believe are direct descendants of the legacy of Scream.",7,1,2,23 December 2004
Halloween," A Modern Classic - Really
","Whilst always hesitant to label anything under 25 years old a classic, Halloween is now over 25 years of age, has withstood the test of time, spawned so many numerous sequels directly and indirectly, and made John Carpenter, Donald Pleasance, Debra Hill, and Jamie Lee Curtis rich and famous - not to mention brought Michael Myers into the collective consciousness of our culture. Series like Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street owe their existence to Carpenter and this low-budget horror film centered around the most fitting of all holidays for murder - Halloween. We all the the story. We all know the great direction and musical score Carpenter contributed. We all know that Jamie Lee Curtis started out here on her way to becoming a competent actress(as well as lovely one). What some of us sometimes forget(especially those that label this film as trash and have never seen it) is how bloodless it really is. Carpenter gets far more out of what he doesn't show than what he does show. His knack for creating suspenseful, jump-out-of-your seat scenes is legendary in this film and his subsequent ones. Carpenter pieced this one together just right at just the right time. He picked good actors. Curtis is good as the heroine Laurie Strode. Credibility is brought by English stalwart Donald Pleasance as Dr. Sam Loomis - a role turned down first by Peter Cushing and then by Christopher Lee. I am sure both would have been great(I particularly would have love to have seen Cushing in that role), but fortunately for all involved Pleasance was cast and makes the most out of the role. He is in many ways the backbone of the movie - a center of reality to be brought back to again and again. Anyway, I could...and should...gush on and on about the importance of this film to all horror after 1978. It is undoubtedly the most influential horror film of the last 30 years in terms of its long-lasting staying power, and its has been used as the model for many, many, many horror films since that year. Carpenter has since gone on to direct many fine features; some of them are even better films than Halloween. But if his legacy is to be remembered for one film, I can think of no finer film than Halloween to be remembered for. Halloween and John Carpenter are forever linked.",9,7,9,19 December 2005
1408," Room Service Please!
","Director Mikael Hafstrom creates an eerie, fast-paced, tense thriller here about a cynical writer of haunted homes and hotels that goes to the Dolphin Hotel in New York City to investigate the paranormal attributes of a specific room - 1408. Based on a short story by Stephen King, 1408 delivers in terms of genuine scares, psychological horror, and first-rate special effects. John Cusak plays the writer who has been jaded by what the hand life has dealt him with charisma, wit, and and great skill. Cusak's Mr. Enslin is very believable and that is so necessary for a film that is relies so heavily on one performance - for you see, Cusak is acting against the room throughout the bulk of the film. An evil room that has been responsible for 56 deaths. Supporting performers are very good as well with Samuel Jackson giving a high-octane performance as the manager of the hotel pleading Cusak to not stay in this room. The film is shot with breathtaking attention to detail. The hotel itself has a life of its own as does the dreaded room. The script keeps you guessing what will happen and many might object to what they might perceive as a lack of real explanation by the film's close. This ending was just right I thought for a thriller based on so many psychological elements. 1408 is a rare horror treat these days with its innovative story, solid acting, and reliance on the viewer's imagination(to some degree at least).",7,3,4,21 October 2007
The Iron Giant," Heavy Metal
","It is encouraging...and surprising that a film like this was ever made.  It is obviously very family-oriented.  It focusses on a bygone era.  It has no mass destruction, no death, no profanity, no sex.  It tells the simple story of a boy with an imagination and kind heart who befriends an Iron Giant from outer space.  The story is simple, yet says so much about people and fear of those things that are different.  The film, however, is just not for children, it is for adults as well.  It breathes nostalgia of a time when the life of a child was full of science fiction films of the fifties, great comic books like Superman, and the seeming impending doom of the atomic bomb.  This film is exquisitely animated in an animation we seldom see anymore.  The characters are richly drawn and the voice-overs are perfect in both timing and choice of artists.  There is also a gentle, sometime low-brow humour throughout the film that helps bring back the memory of what is was like to be a child.  The friendship between the metal man and the young boy is poignant, funny, and tearful.  Chris MacDonald does an exceptional job as the voice of the government man more afraid of the inexplicable and the unknown than of his own personal corruption.  A funny, very moving film!",Null,0,0,19 September 2001
The Silence of the Lambs," Class Act
","With Silence of the Lambs comes some much needed recognition for the horror genre.  It is a first-rate production all around.  It boasts a witty and suspenseful script based on the Thomas Harris novel, full of great lines. It has marvelous direction from Demme.  Demme creates suspense very well throughout and uses some great directorial shots such as the twin frames of Clarice ringing a doorbell and the FBI men breaking into a home.  The two lead actors won oscars for their performances...each deserved.  Foster is very good in her role, but it is Anthony Hopkins that literally lights up the screen with his complex portrayal of a complex serial killer.  Hopkins does the seemingly impossible. He frightens you with his outrageousness and yet illicts some pity/compassion(albeit not a lot) for his situation.  He says his lines with reservedness when needed and brashness when needed.  The rest of the cast is also quite good with Anthony Heald a standout as a unethical, petty doctor in charge of Hopkins.  Of course the story of the other killer is very very chilling as well.  A quality film in all aspects!",Null,89,142,19 June 2000
Signs," Much Ado About Nothing
","As I watched this film, it became apparent that I was watching some form of H. G. Wells's The War of the Worlds.  That novel is a skeletal frame for the alien part of the film.  Aliens come to Earth.  The farmhouse is very much like the one seen in the 50's picture of that name.  There are many other similar things.  But the alien aspect of the movie, while very integral to the plot, is but one facet of the story, the major thrust of the story deals with a man having recently lost his wife lose his faith in God.  Now, having seen The Sixth Sense a few times and loving it for its ending, I went into Signs expecting something of the same.  In that regard I was disappointed. The ending can be seen almost at the beginning of the film.  So, I had to put that aside and think about the story.  The story is pretty good if you look at its philosophical roots about how you look at what you are given in life.  The movie is really about perception and how each of us is to perceive what we are given in life.  We can always focus on what we don't have and have not accomplished, OR we can look at what we do have and have accomplished.  Do we see the glass as half empty or half full?  This aspect of the film makes Signs a compelling picture.  Mel Gibson does a very good job playing a man torn by his feelings.  The rest of the acting is good as well (with the exception of M. Night Shymalan in a fairly big role).  The story is laden down with too many contrivances and for that reason Signs will not appeal to many.  It has a silly ending if you don't see the man struggling with his faith as the major focus of the film.  The director does infuse many taught, suspenseful scenes, and although I believe this film lacks the the power of The Sixth Sense, it does pack a few punches.",Null,1,4,26 January 2003
The Sixth Sense," Death is in the air
","A wonderful, suspenseful, frightening film about a relationship with a young boy and a child psychologist.  The young boy lives a life of solitude and fear as he has this special sense or power to see dead people as well as the living.  M. Night Shyalmalan does an outstanding job with the direction and script of this now-classic chiller.  The acting is superb as both Bruce Willis and especially Haley Joel Osment give performances...excuse the pun...to die for.  The film has a power in itself and it gets a grip on the viewer and does not let go till the very end..and although the ending is somewhat known for its twist...I did not know what was coming the first time I saw the film.  I was totally floored when I saw it and spent the second viewing making sure it was at all plausible...and it was.  I recommend this film heartily and strongly recommend everyone seeing it at least twice.",Null,0,0,5 August 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Masterpiece for Ages to Come
","The final installment of the trilogy has been put in place, and Peter Jackson and company have given us a set of films that will be required viewing to new generations.  The third film - The Return of the King - is as good as the first two films.  It ties up most of the loose strings very nicely and puts an end finally to the epic battle of good and evil that has beset Middle Earth.  Although these films are separate, they really are to me one long film with much needed rest breaks.  I can already envision sitting down year after year spending a day watching the whole film from the opening scene of The Fellowship of the Ring(extended DVD version of course) to the final closing scene of The Return of the King(Boy, I cannot wait till that extended version comes out!).  Jackson's masterful direction and ability to tell a story with suspense and grandeur are not to be under-estimated.  I hope that the members of the Academy of Arts and Sciences realize their duty and award him the Best Director Oscar and this film the Best Picture Oscar.  Both are very deserved.  Besides the rich story, the eye-popping cinematography, the compelling special effects, the haunting music, The Return of the King has some very solid performances by the entire cast.  Elijah Wood gets little credit but his Frodo is well-conceived.  Sean Astin is very strong as Samwise.  Sir Ian McKellan should have won the Academy Award for his turn as Gandalf in the first film. Still good, he has little screen time comparatively in this film. Mortensom, Bloom, and in particular Bernard Hill all shine again.  John Rhys Davies as Gimli sparkles with the little screen time he has.  I was very disappointed to see Mr. Christopher Lee's scenes cut, but anxiously await them in the extended version.  His contributions to the first two films are indeed very strong.  Bottom Line:  three movies had never been made at the same time in the history of film.  These three were and they are cinematic gems!  They have dazzled Tolkien fans the world over, but more importantly, they have turned thousands into viewers and even readers of fantasy.  That is the positive power of film!",10,0,1,29 December 2003
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A Classic? Maybe.
","Well, I am simply stunned by all the favorable....actually beyond that...praise bestowed upon this film.  So many people call it a classic...and indeed for a new generation...it is along with the likes of Halloween and Friday the 13th.  I liked the film.  I thought its concept was original, well-directed, adequately acted, and had gobs of great atmosphere. There are some truly frightening scenes in the film.  But...and I guess you knew that was coming...but I felt the film was just too incomprehensible to make it a true classic. The plot is riddled with holes.  We get a little expository information on this Freddy Krueger, but then nothing is done with it.  Also, the status of what is a dream and what is reality is never clear, and certainly adds to Wes Craven's ability to get you jumping out of your seat - with no accountability on his part to be anything but ambiguous. That said, this is a fine film.  For those of you that like lots of blood and special effects, this is like a motherlode.  I thought they were inventive, but the best scenes are the ones that use our imagination a bit. Look for the scene where the female lead boobytraps the house.  This is a trademark of Craven's.  You can see similar scenes in The Hills Have Eyes and more notably in Last House on the Left.",Null,0,1,27 August 2000
Fantastic Four," Giving a Piece of the Rock
","Taking its place in the parade of comic book super heroes turned big budget movie, The Fantastic Four was a comic book waiting to be filmed. It had all the right ingredients: interesting characters that had undergone some kind of change giving them super powers, an evil associate that turns completely on those once considered his friends, romance between characters, dazzling, perhaps over-used CGI effects, lots of destruction, humorous super hero when more than one super hero is used at one time, and the list goes on. While it just doesn't have the heart and tenacity of either of the two Spiderman movies or the visual splendor or acting range of the other super hero ensemble X-Men series, The Fantastic Four is a pretty good film that delivers entertainment if nothing else. It should appease the die-hard Fantastic Four fans with its characterizations being very closely done with the comics in mind and the story following much of the comics as well. Ioan Gruffudd plays Reed Richards and brings stability, believability, and presence to what many think is a somewhat thankless role as Mr. Fantastic 'Stretch.' Gruffudd's stable force helps counteract some of the other acting ranges. Jessica Alba plays Sue Storm. She is pretty to be sure - and probably the weakest of the quartet in terms of acting ability. It seems to be really hurting her huh? Yeah, right! She's blonde, she's curvy, and she can really fill out a skin-tight super hero outfit. Johnny Storm is played by the youthful and enthusiastic Chris Evans. His performance is the lighter side of the four and funny. The scene where is is playing with a doll of the Thing was amusing. And that brings us to the best of the four, Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm, the heart and soul of this film. Chiklis gives a lot to this performance and his characterization makes this movie more than just a super hero movie loaded with special effects - which it is but has a bit more to it as well. I really liked the special effects they used with the Thing where director Tim Story(what a great last name for a director!)decided to go with a costume for Grimm rather than make him totally CGI like used in The Hulk. In that film, the Hulk was impersonal and not believable; here, the Thing is very believable and Chiklis is able to act in the suit and show a whole range of emotions. If this process had been used in Ang Lee's mega-disaster, maybe it would have been somewhat decent. OK, I know I am STRETCHING things now. Anyway, The Fantastic Four is a formula super hero movie but an enjoyable one and should spawn many a sequel. And once again, let's give the most credit for this film, Spiderman, the X-Men, and so on where it is due - Thank You so very much Stan Lee!",6,0,1,19 December 2005
Saboteur," Under-appreciated Hitchcock Classic!
","The scene is World War II, and a man at an aircraft factory is mistakenly accused of killing his buddy in an act of sabotage.  He must find the man who framed him in order to prove his innocence.  This is the story behind one of Alfred Hitchcock's lesser known films, and certainly one of his better suspense thrillers.  The story is really nothing unique to Hitchcock as it is the basic premise behind films like The Man Who Knew Too Much, North By Northwest, The 39 Steps, The Lady Vanishes, etc...  It is, however, as with most of Hitch's film, the execution of the plot that makes the film so good.  The acting is first-rate, and Bob Cummings probably gives his best performance.  Norman Lloyd excels as the villain Frye, and Otto Krueger is magnificent as an evil traitor bent on ruining the framework of America so as to allow a Fascist regime to take over.  Yes, the movie is very patriotic, and it does have some very sentimental dialogue, etc....but this film must be looked at in the context with which it was made.  Beside having some very thrilling and climactic scenes, the best revolve around the good of people and the spirit of man to help his fellow man, as with the encounter with the blind man and with the traveling circus. Enjoy!",Null,3,5,16 January 2000
The Birds," Birds of a Feather...Flock Together
","Hitchcock does it again...he takes the seemingly ordinary and mundane in life like a simple act of taking a shower in Psycho, the familial relationship of Niece and Uncle in Shadow of a Doubt, and, in this picture, the natural, friendly relationship of commonplace birds with mankind - and turns them into nightmarish scenes.  In the Birds, Hitchcock displays his gargantuan talent for creating and sustaining suspense.  On the Californian coast, for some inexplicable reason, birds begin attacking people.  Hitchcok uses this backdrop to showcase the story of a family and a visitor, Tippie Hedren, in the midst of this unnatural phenomenon,  This film is a pleasure to watch because it is so well-done.  Hitchcock's direction is superb.  The work with the birds themselves is amazing as thousands of real ones were used with mechanical ones.  Quite impressive.  The acting is first-rate with Rod Taylor, Suzanne Pleshette, and Jessica Tandy in attendance.  Easily my favourite scene is the one when the townfolk are in the diner....talking about the rumours of the birds...and an elderly woman begins to expound on the genial nature of our feathered friends...only to have her words simplicity shattered in moments. A great film based on a story by Daphne Du Maurier.",Null,1,1,20 August 2000
Jurassic Park," Dinosaur Heaven
","So many reviews.  So much praise.  What could I possibly add?  Well, not a whole lot really.  This film is the best dinosaur movie ever made without question.  It is above the scope of the normal film of this nature, it transcends the ordinary to become the extraordinary.  Director Steven Spielberg has created a timeless gem here that entertains on many levels, but ultimately is a scary, horrifying look into what would happen if dinos and man mixed.  The special effects are what keep this film going and they are spectacular.  The dinosaurs look so real and animated with life.  Their ability to move, eat, and even think is a sight to behold.  The acting in this film is also very good.  Most of the characters have very definable personalities and you care for them throughout their struggles to survive. Sam Neil is excellent and Jeff Goldblum easily has the best lines in the film.  The musical score is wonderful.  For me, some of the best scenes in the picture are when Sam Neil is watching the dinosaurs that he has only theorized about his whole life.  He looks on like I imagine I would...with almost a child-like fascination.  The scene with all the little dinos running in a herd in the middle of a field in particular stands out as the enchanting musical score plays in the background.  This movie is one of the all-time money makers.  It is obvious to see why.  I cannot imagine that there is still someone that hasn't seen this, but if you are out there and have not - make sure you watch it lest you become a dinosaur in your own right.",Null,2,4,17 April 2001
The Wizard of Oz," Greatest Fantasy Film Ever?
","The magic that this film creates cannot be denied by the few humbugs that find it boring or only for kids.  This is a film masterpiece THAT has stood the test of time.  Its magic has not decreased but increased.  I will not go into everything which has already been gone over.  Obviously the music, the sets, Judy Garland, the rest of the cast, and everything else is something special.  I grew up with this film;  I waited eagerly every Easter for it to come on TV.  What particularly works for me?  The film has the MGM musical tradition behind it and dancers and singers in roles, but the story and creativity and diversity of the musical score attract me.  Margaret Hamilton makes an outstanding witch too!  The film has some remarkable scenes: the field laden with poppy flowers, the flying monkeys carrying Dorothy away, the guards ho-he-hoing at the castle, and of course Munchkintown and its citizens.  Though the years have passed by rather quickly, I still have an enormous respect for this film and a great desire to still watch it for the fiftieth plus time. The Wizard of Oz is movie magic at its zenith and has enthralled young and old alike for every generation after 1939.",Null,3,5,3 July 2004
Evil Dead II," To Have and Hand Not
","Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is a splashier, dare I say, more sophisticated re-make/sequel of the original Evil Dead. It is not a true sequel as it revisits basically much of what happened in the original but only changing things around. Things are changed around enough; however, to clearly make this a different film and not a true remake. At any rate, this aspect of the film was interesting to me. Now, confessedly I was not a huge fan of the original Evil Dead. I didn't think it was a bad movie nor a real good one either. I do understand why so many people love it, but I admitted then - and now - that this type of material is just not my cinematic cup of tea. Bruce Campbell(again playing Ash) and his girlfriend wend their way over the river and through the woods to some cabin in the remotest part of nowhere - where only weeks before an Archaeologist(something like that) and his wife were staying decoding the book of the dead(Necrominicon(?)). I did like the obvious homage to Lovecraft. Anyway, Campbell arrives, plays a tape revealing the words that wake the evil dead, and his girlfriend quickly dies, only to come back and lose her head, be chainsawed, and dance(through a type of clay-mation) naked in the woods with her headless torso and head in hand. All of this happens in the first ten minutes or so into the film. From there, Campbell begins his one man comedy/horror show. He is about as big a slice of ham you will find. Obviously, more people come - and die - and there is a neat ending to the film which opens for another sequel(Army of Darkness). Campbell breathes some life into this movie creating a frenetically eerie, over-the-top performance of Ash, a man having lost his hand by cutting it off himself still having a sense of humour and seeming to fear nothing(including in his performance). Director Sam Raimi shows us why he became a big league director. He has talent. He still is using a small budget in comparison to what an A-list film would take. You can't tell watching this. Raimi gets the most out of everything(and even more with Campbell). He also creates some innovative camera shots - uses a lot of the same shots from the first Evil Dead - and paces his film with a high energy that will make you jump a lot. That all notwithstanding, I like a little more meat to my story. I like a bit more logic - not just fun. That is why again I will say that Evil Dead 2 is not a bad film, not a great one, but just not my kind of film. I am ecstatic that so many people enjoy mindless violence in rural areas with chainsaws, cleavers, etc...but it's just not me. For me, I just didn't find Evil Dead 2...all that Groovy! I did prefer it though to the original. This one is a bit more fun and doesn't have nearly as much screaming. The best part - hands down - was when Campbell, after having taken his hand off, places a bucket over it to restrain it and then puts a bunch of books on top. The top book was Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms. Now that was clever!",4,7,15,30 March 2005
