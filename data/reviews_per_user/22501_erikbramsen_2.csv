Whip It," Meh!
","I'm a fairly recent convert to roller derby having found it an excellent spectator sport: simple rules, fast pace, exciting showdowns and a good balance between grace and power. So I was really looking forward to this movie and it took me some effort to get my mitts on a copy.And it's not actually bad as such; Ellen Page is cuter than a thousand Ewoks, the score is good and Barrymore is always a treat. I don't even mind the utter predictability, that's just how some movies roll, no pun intended.But it never really gripped me. The comparison to a masterpiece like Bend It Like Beckham may be a bit unfair but it's inevitable as Whip It is an almost 1:1 rip-off. But where Jess is a plausible footballer, Bliss ('Bliss'? Really?) is just not believable. She never makes us understand why she's attracted to roller derby, except as an escape from her over-the-top horrible parents and she never really manages to make the transition from meek mommy's girl to bad-ass rollergirl, not even when she pulls the ultimate empowerment trick and takes off her glasses. Her nick, Babe Ruthless remains a joke.It also remains a mystery how she suddenly becomes the fastest thing on eight wheels. There's no Rocky theme, no real struggle, it just happens. One moment she Bambi on roller skates, the next she's flying like the wind. Same thing with her team. One moment they are losers, the next moment they are kicking ass. How did that come about? Oh yeah, they suddenly decide to listen to the weirdo posing as a coach.So, at least this movie has some smoking derby action? Well, not really. I've seen more exiting footage on my local team's website and without the fistfights and the gutter moves too. And I'm from Copenhagen, for heavens sake!",Null,0,3,21 November 2011
The Hurt Locker," 97% Rotten Tomatoes? You must be kidding!
","I saw this one because it got raving reviews. Jeremy Renner did an excellent job, and he'd deserved to have had a better script. Hell, he deserved to have had a script at all. All he had was a bunch of clich√©s stacked two hours high and a hand-held camera.New NCO initially welcomed with hostility because he replaces dead comrade? Check! NCO wins over squad despite his unconventional, hard-charging methods? Check! NCO befriends 12-year old boy from the enemy camp? Check! 12-year old boy killed? Check! The squad nerd kills a hostile and grows a pair? Check! And after dutifully plodding through the motions it ends with a big, big surprise: James is an adrenaline addict! And just to make sure nobody is caught off guard by this startling conclusion, the movie opens with the quote: 'War is a drug.'James Coburn did this whole movie in a two-minute sequence of 'Cross of Iron' where he leaves the hospital and a hot nurse - Peckinpah having his priorities straight - and he didn't utter a single word.",Null,2,3,3 September 2011
