The King's Speech," Not a big enough story
","Colin Firth gives a flawless performance as George VI in this very British tale all about the unlikeliest King in British history. There's a distinct historical atmosphere set very early in the movie and it does manage to keep you interested right up until the movie's slightly sickly sweet ending. I am sorry to say though that terrific talents like Helena Bonham-Carter and Geoffrey Rush are a bit wasted here. The story just isn't big enough to justify having heavy weight actors like Bonham-Carter and Rush in supporting roles. There's also a cameo role for Michael Gambon as George's father George V. The period is very well created in the movie and if Oscars are being handed out there may well be one for the costume designers. Guy Pearce gives a believable enough performance as George's abdicating brother, Edward VIII and there's lots of familiar faces from British TV and film popping up. No doubt it will be a huge hit with American audiences who can't seem to get enough of 'British Posh' these days. Good luck explaining the 'constitutional crisis', to them by the way. For this reviewer though, there's just too much incongruity between the very simple story and the heavy dramatic production. A more light hearted production might have been more appropriate. But none of my criticisms should detract from a beautiful performance by Colin Firth.",7,1,3,20 January 2011
The Blind Side," how did this win an award?
","I think the Acadamy is being very kind to Sandra Bullock by giving her the best actress award for this movie. Rarely have I seen a more irritating, feel good fetish. It is so predictable that it would be almost impossible to include spoilers in the review, but for the benefit of the mentally deficient I'll try not to give away too much. Basically, its the story of a gentle giant who gets adopted by the most nauseatingly nice family since the Brady Bunch. Our hero, 'Big Mike' is a misfit kid from the projects who gets accepted into a high performing high school. One night, as he's making his way to the gym, were he sleeps, the Touhey family take pity on him and take him into their perfect family home. This is were Sandra Bullock takes control of the plot and of the whole movie. There's no doubt in my mind that Director John Lee Hancock molded this movie to make Sandra Bullock look like the award winning actress she isn't. Her husband, Sean, played by Tim McGraw, is the most pointless character in movie history. Even a henpecked husband would be more humorous than the impotent piece of passivity this man represents. Son, S.J., played by Jae Head, is one of those annoying child characters who gets way too much screen time and daughter, Collins, played by Lily Collins has to be the most understanding teenage girl ever to feature in a Hollywood movie. Quinton Aaron, who plays 'Big Mike' does as good a job as he's let, given that he dare not steal attention from Sandra Bullock's dominance. There's one good scene when he returns to the bad guys in the projects were he grew up. It's the only good scene actually, probably because Sandra Bullock is not in it. I won't bore you with the details of the whole football plot, you'll guess were its going very early on; especially when Sandra Bullock's character starts telling the coach what to do. Apart from the 'Boys in the Hood' in Mike's old neighborhood, there's just one other bad guy, but he's just a loud mouth racist at a football game who Sandra Bullock deals with predictably. There's shades of 'Mr. Holland's Opus' 'Good Will Hunting' and even 'Shine' in this movie. Sadly though, those shades are quickly obliterated by Miss Bullocks ego.",3,16,31,8 March 2010
