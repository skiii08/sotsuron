Hereditary," Headscratcher with an Amazing Performance
","Without Toni Collette on board, this would never stand a chance. The casting, plot unveiling, and ability for audiences to follow along we're all lacking. There were some neat scenes in the movie that entertainin and chill you. Overall, this is worth renting on a rainy night. I saw this in theaters specifically because I am a fan of Toni Collette's work and I knew she would deliver. Critics will love it because audiences will struggle to understand it. It scares a little, confuses a lot, and for the most part, entertains.",7,0,6,12 June 2018
Captain Marvel," Tried Too Hard and Fell Short
",An attempt to empower Brie Larson made her come off as sassy. This film felt underwelming and too lighthearted considering this character is supposed to beat Thanos. I don't blame Brie. I just wished it had been a little darker and more serious. Girls between the age of six and 14 might like it and that's who's buying all the merchandise anyway.,5,3,9,9 March 2019
Toy Story 4," Does Not Dissappoint
","They could've mailed this one in and made millions and millions at the box office; however, it was delightfully entertaining throughout with something for everyone. There are some slightly intense scenes that I would not recommend for children under the age of five years old.",8,1,4,22 June 2019
