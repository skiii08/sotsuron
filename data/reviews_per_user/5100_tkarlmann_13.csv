Ford v Ferrari," Forget the 'title' this film is way more important than it.
","This film is ALL about Ken Miles, who tragically passed away, shown briefly near the end of the film.
It is an injustice to name this film 'Ford vs Ferrari'. The film depicts Ken Miles, without whom, perhaps, none of the wins would ever have been made by Ford.
Now, I'm not an avid car enthusiast. That said, I do recall, from my relatively advanced age, that cars from that era, from Ford and other US car-makers, were not that well made. Because of this, later, the Japanese imports had much better fit & finish than US cars did. This is hilariously brought out in this film -- where the Ken Miles character cannot get his race car door to close! Then, one of the pit crew comes over with a Big Hammer (almost like Thor's) and Closes the door!
Yes, OK, there is some in the film about Ford vs Ferrari; but there is more about the Big Shots at Ford wanting to do things 'Their Way', rather than the Correct Way -- purported by Miles & Shelby.This is what big corporations always do. Then when there is a success, based on the skills of others, they cannot pat themselves on the back enough!The fact that I really don't see myself as a race car or even a sports car enthusiast, and that I've rated the movie a '10', should tell you something. This life is NOT about corporations; it IS about People! For this film, that Person is Ken Miles. OK, certainly Carol Shelby too. Kind of like an Earp&Holiday-esque sort of thing with heavy emphasis on Ken Miles.
Oh, you want some description of the acting, do you? Well, I'll just say that the acting was so good, it never got in the way of telling the Ken Miles story. That should be enough praise for the actors. Look Ken Miles up on Wiki.",10,1,2,13 April 2020
Hereditary," All the great ratings for THIS? Are you serious?
","This film has it's horror aspect, assuredly. However the ending warps into something no one needs. All the devil-worship nonsense that is creeping into our society is disconcerting. The film progresses creepily until the last 15 minutes or so. Then it turns into someone's idea that devil worship is going to lead to something good. This is not true -- we decidedly have enough Demoncrats!",2,3,6,26 August 2018
Inglourious Basterds," I have NEVER seen such a performance ... ever!
","No, I'm not speaking of Brad Pitt; I'm speaking of German actor Christoph Waltz! He has won just about every award for his performance in this film, and he deserves every single one of them.
Take my Challenge: Watch this film and see if you don't get the chills whenever Christoph Waltz's character is 'interrogating' his suspects! Ooooo!
He is ULTRA polite with each one; and has supreme confidence in his scary, chilling, bold mannerisms.
All I can say is: 'You see this movie for Christoph Waltz's performance; all the rest is secondary'!",10,2,3,27 February 2020
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," B O R I N G
","I got about half-way through the film and was so bored, I had to stop watching. I think the acting was good and the visuals were OK, but the story just plain sucked. I know this film earned lots of money and accolades; but who would sit through this film if it was not 'Star Wars'? I think folks just wanted more Star Wars. It was soooo good to see Peter Cushing again as well as the original Princess Leia -- even though both are dead.",2,1,6,21 September 2018
Captain Marvel," Well, nice fireworks display
","Nice acting, what there was of it. Mostly, I got the impression that these fine actors & actresses just stood there while someone just paints on all the digital effects. I was, as others have said, bored with this movie. The entire last 1/4 of the film was a nice fireworks display but that's about it.
If you are looking for an equivalent of Avengers 1 where all the Avengers stand in a circle -- ready to fight the unknown armies from space, after just barely getting over fighting among themselves -- forget it in this movie.
If all you need is to see how Nick Fury loses his eye -- then by all means see this film.
I found the Heroine confusing. It's like linear time isn't good enough anymore -- we've got to have past, present & future timelines. Yes, it can be boring & confusing at the same time.
Spoiler alert -- Good guys become bad guys for no apparent reason. Remember those old 60's films where everyone is chasing after the latest missile plans on microfilm -- well just replace the microfilm with some unexplained energy thing, and you've got it ... plus more fireworks than 100 July 4th's
Why did I see it, you might ask? Well, as precursor to the upcoming NEW Avengers film, of course. I STILL want to see Thor &/or a non-pansy Hulk pound that stupid Thanos into pulp! Stupid Gems or not!",3,27,44,21 April 2019
Cloverfield," Pathetic!
","21 minutes of utter nonsense until the Monster shows up. Seriously, can you watch 21 minutes of this millennial-spawned crap? Cannot stomach anymore.",2,1,4,31 October 2018
The Bodyguard," The Critics got this wrong!
",This is a fine film -- perhaps Critics were waiting for Aliens to land or something. This is a fine film -- with fine performances by all and Great Sounds from Whitney! Enjoy!!!,8,1,1,12 April 2019
Suicide Squad," Is it Possible NOT to fall for Margot Robbie?
","I watched an animated version of this film, but still, kinda knowing what was going to happen, I still was completely taken in with the entire movie! I think Magrot Robbies' 'Harley Quinn' character absolutely makes this movie! In the midst of all these really tough bad guys & soldiers, here trots lovable, curvy, scantily-clad Harley Quinn snapping, quibbling and flirting about everything while still managing to be The Joker's girlfriend, definitely does her share of the fighting, NEVER losing her femininity, and cute as all get-out the entire time; while also managing to be the one who gets the ultimate villain in the end! Oh, did I mention, all while strutting around in a completely outlandishly skimpy costume, and bending over constantly? The ONLY compromise made for her was she carried a baseball bat in this movie instead of her typical large wooden hammer. I really had a crush her for the entire movie -- and I'm an older guy!!!",9,0,0,2 December 2019
Justice League," Who did I miss?
","Comic book reader from the 1950's through the 1970's here. I missed Green Lantern and Green Arrow from this film. 
Fantastic job by Wonder Woman and Superman, and all the rest.
I also miss The Flash as an Adult!",8,3,4,7 June 2018
Alien vs. Predator," Great film!
","I think this film aligns itself well with what we know about the Alien and Predator 'Cultures', and then adds to it! Too much anti-gun sentiment, and lack of preparedness kind of spoiled a perfect score. Wow, those sets! If this stuff was real, people could spend lifetimes trying to figure it all out -- that's the spell-binding aspect of this film. Lance Henrickson is one of my favorite actors.",9,0,0,22 September 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Really poor implementation of The Avengers' Characters
","I thought this movie was pathetic. Thor has no Hammer, and forges an axe? Are you serious? The Hulk grapples with Thanos and is overpowered to the point where he is afraid to come out through Banner? Are you serious? Where is CA? He lost his razor AND his shield? Are you serious? Most of the things I expect from the Avengers were absent in this film. There was very little working together to defeat a Foe; and way too much about the Bad Guy -- Thanos. Like, why do I care? Thanos is the Bad Guy, so defeat him and move on! Then the Ending --- utterly pathetic!",2,274,670,1 May 2018
Gran Torino," It's a Clint Eastwood film, what else do you need to know?
","I'm not going into a sophisticated review of this film, there are plenty of those already here. I'd rather just talk about what I felt. This film moved me. I have seen this movie before, and I think it is a movie where you don't really 'get it' the first time you see it. Sure, I wanted another installment of Harry Callahan, just as we all did. This film is different. 
I think that many of Eastwood's films are too sophisticated for the reviewers. There, I said it. I've seen this in Pale Rider, and many of his films. I think we all need to grow up a little when seeing an Eastwood film. In so doing, I think we wake up a little bit, and learn something from them.
I'm going to re-watch some of his other films now; enough of me blabbing here.",10,1,1,22 April 2018
The Wolf of Wall Street," Rang true for me ...
","I admit, that have been the victim of these scum. Did I enjoy this movie? Well, no. It did however help me to understand the scale on which these types of scumbags are victimizing others. Both over the phone and as on-line get-rich-quick scam artists. I spit on them now! I Learned my lessons years ago, but I hope that my review here and this film, will help others to keep their guard up and avoid the ridiculous lure to 'Get Rich Quick'. Learn a skill, be inventive, work hard, and use your time wisely.",9,0,1,12 June 2018
