The New World," Stylish piece of work, but lacked punch and passion.
","I didn't realize before watching this film that Terence Mallick had directed the Thin Red Line and The New World but it didn't take time to spot the style straight off. I like his approach generally, nature shots conveying meaning, depth and beauty, reminding us of a virgin world that is somewhat gone forever. At times however it felt a bit like a nature lesson. Although beautifully shot, the movie I felt lacked real depth of emotion and tension. I feel that the script, scene sequence and score could have got a lot more out of this film, especially given the locations chosen, it practically sold itself. For instance, in Lawrence of Arabia you have spectacular vistas but also an amazing script, great character development, the scenic shots support the project they are not the project, which was how I felt a little watching this movie.I don't think it is sufficient to rely on 'dreamy' scenes of the principal characters rolling around in the grass, almost touching, lingering looks, shots of sunsets and the wind blowing the grass. I can see what the Director is trying to achieve but I think it would be more effective to carve the relationship of the two principal characters out of a strong script, tension scenes and fraught film score, all of which focuses our attention just a bit more on the tension surrounding the characters, the clash of civilizations, the potential problems they will encounter when they connect and so on.There is no doubt that Terrence Malick is a talented individual, however, the New World felt like a string of beautiful shots that just didn't gel together effectively, a lot of jumping around from scene to scene but didn't quite convey what was taking place between the two principal characters, their love for each other set against the backdrop of one of the most important moments in human history. There was too much of Pochaontas prancing around fields, shots of high green grass blowing in the wind, and Indians to stepping out only to disappear (Thin Red Line-esquire).What was needed alongside the beauty was real punch, drama, tension, passion. I thought generally speaking the actors delivered but I found it hard to understand some of the dialogue, especially the children (Irish I believe) in the settlement, and I am Irish.In saying that the final few minutes of the New World moved me greatly. The music, the cutting of scenes, and the final moment when the music stopped, were inspiring. Incidentally, I found the conclusion of the Thin Red Line moving in a similar way. Unfortunately what preceded seemed a bit light on its feet, I never got a sense of the depth of emotion involved and I couldn't help feeling it was a opportunity lost.",7,0,3,12 July 2006
