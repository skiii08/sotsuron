The Avengers," Totally Worth It...
","When it came to Super Hero movies before this, I thought that'd I'd only watch super hero movies just for fun with my family. Not even The Dark Knight, as great a movie as it is, got me so excited after seeing it. But after watching just a couple of the Avenger movies leading up before this, I had one thing to say going into this movie, 'Totally Worth It!' The special effects were Awesome, the action was the best I've seen, and the cast really did a great job. But I think what really made the movie, were the jokes. Don't worry I won't spoil anything. The only reason I'm giving this 9/10 is because I feel the story could of gone a little deeper. But that's just my opinion, I'm just the type of guy that likes long and deep story lines I guess. And if you haven't seen this movie yet because you're afraid you'll be disappointed for some reason, don't be. Just remember 'Totally Worth It!'",9,2,5,18 August 2012
