Blade Runner 2049," A modern masterpiece
","Ignore all the other reviews and comments.This is a movie that will be celebrated more with time, will age like fine wine. Cinematography is breathtaking, Villanueva's best which is saying something, acting is phenomenal. Absolutely must watch after you've seen the final cut of Blade Runner. This movie will stay with you, for a long long time.",10,3,10,19 September 2018
Dunkirk," A visual,immersive and emotional experience not to be missed
","Don't listen to the people who are kinda overwhelmed by the huge wave of positive response and feel the need to nitpick this movie.This movie is like Radiohead's Kid A,where we finally see Nolan come into his own.A war movie with a concept that is mostly original which is absolutely rare in this modern day and age of movies.Every one is saying how this movie lacks emotion,when i was in the theater, a lot of people were in tears including me.Even if you do not like this movie,this is a visual experience like no other.But i agree,if you do a little bit of research about the battle and the importance of it beforehand,this movie will make you think about it for days and days.This movie puts you in the soldier's places,immerses you and horrifies you.This movie also shows you what sacrifice the soldiers made for you and me.This movie also reflects life itself kinda.This is a must see,no questions asked.",10,9,18,29 July 2017
