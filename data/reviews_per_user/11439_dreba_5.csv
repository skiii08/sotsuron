Walk the Line," Excellent Movie!!!
","I've seen them all; 'Sweet Dreams,' 'Coal Miner's Daughter,' 'Elvis,' 'The Doors,' 'Great Balls of Fire,' 'The Buddy Holly Story.' This movie, by far, is one of the best yet. I rank it right up there with 'Coal Miner's Daughter' as far as the talent involved and the preparation the actors made to play these roles. I have not been a big Joaquin Phoenix fan, but the way he sings is phenomenal. He starts off tentatively and you can see his talent grows as he becomes more confident. Reese Witherspoon is an absolute doll in the role of June Carter. Her mixture of strength and vulnerability mimic the real June Carter so well that, while the physical resemblance is not there, the emotions certainly are. I HIGHLY recommend this movie to everyone. I think I'm going to have to go see it again.",10,1,3,3 December 2005
Brokeback Mountain," Heath Ledger was robbed!
","I'm sure Phillip Seymour Hoffman did a fine job in 'Capote.' I haven't seen it yet. But it is much easier to portray your impression of a real person than it is to create a character from scratch. Heath Ledger, as Ennis Del Mar, is one of the deepest, complex, most memorable characters that I have ever seen portrayed, on the screen or on the stage. I don't think he said 50 words throughout the whole movie but the way he carried himself, the LACK of movement that he used, really made this character come to life. I had to put the subtitles on so I could see what he was saying because the manner in which he spoke made it nearly impossible to understand what he was saying. That made Ennis all the more real.The relationship between Ennis and Jack was so.......God, I don't have the words to describe it. I have never been so moved in my entire life. This was an amazing film, an amazing story, and even now, an hour after I've watched it, I'm still stunned.",9,14,28,6 April 2006
The Devil Wears Prada," Stanley Tucci stole the show!!!
","My daughter read the book and wanted me to go see the movie with her. I was truly entertained by all of the back-biting and bitching that went on at 'Runway' magazine, which is helmed by the inimitable Meryl Streep. She puts the 'itch' in bitch. You wait on tenterhooks for her to devour demure, clueless little Anne Hathaway. Keep waiting. All the while their little dance of death is going on, there is Stanley Tucci in the background, chewing up the scenery. He plays Fairy Godmother to Anne's Cinderella and it is a scene that would make any girl's heart go pitter-pat. All those designer close being thrown about, and the JIMMY CHOOS!!!! If you're going to see the clothes, you will be happy. If you are going to see Meryl act like a bitch, you will be happy. But go to see Stanley Tucci; he is poetry in motion, dressed to the nines (especially in his plaid suit), and as bitchy and gossipy as any old queen!! Plus seeing New York in all of its glory is always a treat. This was a great movie. I highly recommend it to: 20-30something women, gay men, anyone who loves anything Meryl Streep does, and those Stanley Tucci fans out there (and you know who you are!!).Enjoy!!",7,12,23,30 June 2006
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Sucked!!!!
","I don't even know where to begin with how disappointed I was with this movie. Having grown up with the incredibly talented Gene Wilder as 'Willy Wonka,' I expected my view to be tainted, but I tried to watch this film with an open mind. Nice try. Johnny Depp, who has made some wonderful movies in his own right, cannot hold a candle to Gene Wilder in this role. Whereas Wilder played Wonka as mysterious, a bit mischievous, but good-hearted, Depp played him like he had just done a serious amount of cocaine. His dislike for the children was overplayed and I was waiting for him to beat the crap out of them at any moment. Wilder's performance was more subtle and sarcastic. Depp's June Allyson hairstyle did nothing for me either. Whereas 'Willy Wonka...' was made years before all this computer graphics crap, it seemed more real. 'Charlie...' seemed like a film student's graduate project. Bottom line: 'Willy Wonka...' is for adults. 'Charlie...' is for children with a low I.Q. Some movies just don't need to be remade; in fact most don't. Look at 'Cheaper by the Dozen' and 'Yours, Mine, and Ours.' The people who made these movies took classic comedy and turned them into fart jokes and basic toilet humor. Doesn't anyone in Hollywood have an original idea? Or has America lost its integrity when it comes to movies? The best movies being made these days are independent films. What does that tell you?",1,18,34,3 December 2005
Beetlejuice," 'come on down, i'll....chew on a dog!!'
","the first time my daughter and i saw this movie, we had rented it from the video store.  when it was over, we immediately rewound it and watched it again.  we were laughing so hard, we could barely breathe.  this is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen.  at times dark and brooding, at other times downright slapstick, 'beetlejuice' is one of tim burton's best movies.",Null,0,2,14 August 2002
