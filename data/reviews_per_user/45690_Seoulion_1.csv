Sucker Punch," Terrible (shout)
","This film takes the title of the worst film I have ever seen.1. Actors couldn't act. Simple. 2. Blatant contrived attempt at being deep, failed completely unless you're a Twilight fan. 3. Tarnished the name of a respectable director. 4. Obvious effort was given towards giving the dragged-along-boyfriend an erection by the sexual exploitation of the cast. 5. Severe lack of plot. 6. The cheesy narrator mentioning that 'everyone has a guardian angel', thats not even relevant to anything within the film. What this film has done is ruined its target market. If you are going for the teenage girl with no brain, take out the guns and fight scenes where you can see the crotch of the main character. If you are going for the teenage male then cut out the 'guardian angel' because he won't ever be able to admit he has seen the film afterwards. No adults in their right mind would view this film willingly. And there is too much sex for children to view it too.",1,6,13,29 November 2012
