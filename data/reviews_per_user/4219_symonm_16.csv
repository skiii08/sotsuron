Alien 3," Worthy of a second viewing, but make it the Directors cut!
","Alien 3 is a much better film than many seem to think IMO.It seems that a mainly US audience didn't like it initially but the European audience apparently did. I can't figure out why that should be, but if it's just that the US saw only the theatrical release which was re-edited by the studio before release and not the original Assembly (or Directors) cut version which shows us what Fincher's and Weaver's vision actually were, maybe that's more understandable. It can't hold a candle to the first two movies but overall it's not bad at all. Moody, atmospheric and with fantastic settings and camera-work. I liked the story and the sub plots, most of which were lost or watered down in the theatrical release including Golic releasing the creature from captivity (an entire section which bizarrely disappears in the theatrical release) and the subtle clean ending of the extended version where the Queen does not emerge from the suicidal Ripley at the last moment. Alien 3 in retrospect works well in the series and if you take the version the Director intended you to see and watch it again you may see it in a different light.",6,0,0,15 August 2011
I'm Not There," Beautiful inventive biopic, but you probably need to be a fan already
","I guess this is another one of those films that does require the viewer (for the most part) to actually like the subject matter. For me, being Dylan's biggest fan, this was never an issue but it still needed, as a 'project' film, to be well cast and well scripted. It was.Personally I thought everyone worked well but particular kudos to Cate Blanchett who is extraordinary as the young Dylan. So convincing in every way that for a moment I forgot who was playing the role. Marcus Carl Franklin as 'little Woody' was also incredible, Julianne Moore is always superb and carried the 'Joan Baez' role with uncanny beauty and even Richard Gere shone in his brief 'Billy the Kid' role.These sort of multi faceted 'people' films (think Crash, Magnolia, Bobby etc) work if the story is good. Maybe they don't always have to stay 100% true to the base storyline, although those who know enough about Dylan's life and music will certainly feel that his many facets were very well represented here, but they do have to be entertaining. I loved this movie as I thought I would, because above all else it was entertaining. Could've been a disaster but if you love Dylan's philosophy as well as his music, you'll love this.",8,0,0,24 July 2009
Citizen Kane," The best film ever?...Hard to argue against that accolade.
","It's perhaps pointless to eulogise too much more about a film widely and eternally regarded as the best ever made because it's hard to add anything original to what has already been said.What I would say is that although it's not really possible to quantify what makes anything 'the best ever', this comes as close as it's possible to imagine. Particularly given the technical and cultural restrictions and modus operandi at the time it was made. Citizen Kane is a masterpiece of cinema in every way. A wonderful story told in a non-linear way (itself very unusual for it's time), yet the viewer never loses the plot or the power of the unfolding tale. Fantastic central and supporting performances and such majestic cinematography that it truly does deserve it's Everest like billing.Citizen Kane, while a product of its time is still absolutely genius filmmaking.",10,0,3,3 February 2012
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino always polarises opinion but...
","...his films are damn entertaining. At their best (Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, both Kill Bill's) they are without comparison as no one else makes films like he does. Personally I am a huge fan, I love the character development, the fantastically clever use of dialogue, the perfectly balanced music score and the story lines themselves. The lack of accuracy or attention to historical detail doesn't bother me either as I leave his films thoroughly entertained every time. However I do understand that in respect to this film particularly, QT is taking huge liberties with his historical interpretation and that will no doubt bother some people. On this occasion, it doesn't me! So we have a film about a group of Nazi hunting Jew soldiers led by the wonderfully OTT Lt Aldo Raine and a lovely interwoven secondary plot featuring the escape of a Jewish girl and her eventual revenge on the vicious Nazi that murdered her family. It's told with humour, pathos and a devil-may-care approach to the morals of what both sides are doing and it's all the better for that. Perhaps more than any other QT movie, (OK, maybe Jackie Brown's in the same category here) the inspired choice of musical score particularly when Shosanna is getting made up ready for her big final show (David Bowie's Cat People)is beautiful, powerful and moving and a fitting finale to her part of the plot.Yes it's true to say that the Fuhrer, his key henchmen and a large chunk of the ruling Nazi party probably wouldn't have all attended a small provincial theatre in an occupied land for a propaganda screening during wartime and certainly not with what amounted to just a handful of footsoldiers for protection and it's possibly fair to say that Shosanna's justification as to how she was now running that theatre may have been more deeply researched by the party sent out to scope the place out before the big day. I'm sure there were many other 'oversights' if one was critiquing a serious factual war film, however...Great film. Loved it.",9,2,5,9 November 2011
Lilo & Stitch," A beautiful animated understanding of the human condition
","I deliberately saw this film again recently having read some of the comments in a quiet moment. I was amazed how some people saw this movie: Most specifically the negative comments. While I appreciate that we're all different, I am at a loss to understand how anyone could not have loved this film? Did some people really think it was too violent, not suitable for children and most bizarrely of all that Lilo was nasty and aggressive? This is a young girl who is poor, teased at school for being 'different' and who has recently lost both her parents in a car crash and she is a therefore a terrible role model for kids??? Lilo was gorgeous, in every way. Disney captured with stunning beauty and accuracy the mannerisms of a troubled child, a little lost, scared and angry, but also sweet, (wanting to pay for her pet herself) loving, (the home made doll she returns to) clear thinking (not feeding Pudge the fish, tuna sandwiches) and hopeful (the constant photo taking of 'family' people that she so yearns for).It's my favourite ever Disney film and in my top 10 of all time because of the way it makes me feel when I watch it. Wonderful characters, laugh out loud funny in places, great soundtrack, strong storyline, good over evil, redemption and ultimately the sort of family values that we all crave. If some people couldn't get over the fact that initially Lilo is a troubled child and Stitch is a character without morals and guidelines (which Lilo teaches him throughout) when that is so obviously the point, I feel sorry for them.A beautiful film in every way 10/10",10,10,13,12 October 2009
Wanted," Unmitigated garbage
","This film stank from the first to the last minute. Where to start: The bad language was totally unnecessary. It's not swearing per se that's the problem, that has it's place when used well as do any other words, it's that this just isn't necessary and it spoils the dialogue when used so liberally and by everyone all the time. My wife described it (before she gave up on it and went to bed) as 'Jason Statham does the Matrix' which I think sums it up nicely.Sure the action was interesting, but so totally unbelievable in every way that it just looked silly. Even allowing for the fact that it was a comic book script, it was so OTT in this respect that I found it impossible to lose myself in it the way I can in films like 'V for Vendetta' or 'Watchmen' The total disregard for human life is often an issue in these sort of films although it can often be excused given the context of the film, but here the gratuitous scene where the fraternity take out a train full of passengers presumably sending everyone (except our 'heroes' of course) plunging to a horrible death is deeply, deeply flawed filmaking.Lastly, just how much do you want to flag up an ending? In fact the many twists and turns were so obvious so far in advance that only the laziest of viewers would fail to see them coming a mile off. Lazy and flawed filmaking again.Had I paid for this, I'd have demanded a refund. One of the worst big budget movies I've ever seen. Hated it and deeply disappointed in Morgam Freeman particularly.",1,2,6,1 July 2009
The Machinist," Above and beyond the call Mr Bale!
","Throughout film history, there are several well documented cases of actors taking their preparation to the max. De Niro's Jake La Motta springs immediately to mind as one prepared to physically alter his body to fit the role but what Christian Bale does here is way above and beyond the call of duty. It's genuinely disturbing and yet crucial to the film to see 'Batman' looking like an Auschwitz survivor.That said, it doesn't define the film. Sure it's a key part of it but the plot is excellent, the way the film unravels (literally in the case of the reveal-all carpet scene we return to at the end) and the way Reznik's reality and his fantasy world blend so seamlessly that it takes real concentration to keep up at times, make this a really, really good psychological thriller. It's possible to work out the ending, in the same way that some guessed Sixth Sense and Usual Suspects perhaps, but it doesn't matter. Brad Andersons 'The Machinist' is an excellent study of how a bad decision that a good man makes, can lead to unbearable guilt and life changing mental frailty and it's a real tick on Christian Bale's acting CV.Congrats to all concerned. Great movie.",9,2,2,30 June 2011
Insidious," Scary at first but then turns into a remake of Poltergeist
","Insidious is a strange movie. I can't remember being initially so unsettled by a horror movie for a long time (maybe White Noise all those years ago, the first viewing of Paranormal Activity perhaps) but it soon descends into a rip-off of more than one 'classic' horror and ends up being almost a word for word re-write of Poltergeist. The eerie moving furniture, the parent having to enter the netherworld to retrieve the child, the ageing female medium that can see the dead and her two buffoon like cohorts that walk around with their Ghostbuster wands. 'Walk to my voice', 'Only you can save him' and so on. At the end, if skeletons had risen from an underground graveyard I'd have laughed out loud, but thankfully there was some saving grace in the ending. Even there though, it's well enough done but it's not a shock. In fact I'd suggest that anyone who didn't see it coming, is at best, very new to Horror.So why the 6 rating? Because it's a product of it's time. It's not original, in fact it's so unoriginal with regard to one particular film that it will be viewed as almost a joke movie to some, but as a standalone scary film (and especially if you're young or new to Horror) it's quite creepy at first and a reasonable stab at the genre. I do wish it had lived up to it's start, not been so predictable and not been so overtly a remake of Poltergeist but I guess it's hard to be truly original in Horror nowadays.",6,2,3,30 April 2012
Paranormal Activity," Lives up to the hype. Very surprising!
","I tend to avoid traditional Horror films and certainly the American ones partly because everything has to be explained to the audience and wrapped up in a little bow at the end, but mainly because they're never horrific or scary at all. As an adult, there are only so many times you can put up with impossibly beautiful teens running around a remote cabin half dressed while the college kid with a grudge (and usually superhuman strength and the power of invisibility) picks them all off one at a time, but 'Blair Witch' was different, so was 'Rec' and most Asian horror is too, so for me there is occasionally still hope with the genre. It was therefore with some trepidation that I went expecting it mostly not to live up to the hype. Another Blair Witch knock off that won't come close I assumed. Jeez was I wrong! It's tense, genuinely scary, with some stand out moments particularly when the bed-cam scenes that aren't shown on the trailer are revealed and is so well acted from two complete unknowns who carry 99% of the film themselves that it's hard to imagine how known actors could've carried this film any better. Each to their own I guess, but I don't scare easily and this film made me jump.I hope they don't go down the sequel route as there's just no need. Blair Witch 2 showed us why that's not always a good idea. So for me it's a huge and very unexpected thumbs up.",9,0,2,11 December 2009
The Dark Knight," Great film, deserves the praise, but 7th best of all time???
","I cannot possibly see how this is the 7th best film of all time on IMDb's list (What, behind Seven Samurai, Wonderful Life and the peerless Donnie Darko to name just a few??) but it is a superb film nevertheless with a stunning performance from Heath Ledger. Simultaneously scary, funny, over the top yet subtle (maybe even to De Niro proportions). Heath's Joker achieves the very difficult task of creating both a likable and a hateful character in one. Nothing short of a brilliant piece of acting which could have won him the Oscar without the undoubted wave of grief following his untimely death.There are I suppose, some nit picking flaws; Dent's Face is so badly damaged, it couldn't possibly function as it does and although it's comic book, a little more realism would have enhanced the experience, the whole premise of good overcoming evil ultimately hinged on every single person on the two boats not wanting to commit murder, even though it would almost certainly mean their own death. Nice idea and it probably worked in the context of the moral meaning of the film but someone would have flipped the switch or tried harder than they did to do so. Minor points, that IMO could have been better portrayed. Still a great movie in every sense. Just not the 7th best of all time!",8,1,4,17 July 2009
The Artist," A wonderful feel good movie for every taste
","It's easy to be disappointed when you so want to like something and I so wanted to like this, because I loved the idea of something so different, so out of the norm, yet made in the modern era. It not only didn't disappoint, it far exceeded my hopes and I and everyone with me left the cinema with huge smiles on our faces.What a wonderful simple tale, beautifully told and acted by both newcomer leads. Moving, funny, enthralling and so genuinely uplifting that I cannot imagine what sort of person wouldn't love this film.The fact that many won't bother to see it because it's B&W or silent or retro or whatever prejudicial reason some people have in their heads is impossible to comment upon without a certain amount of pity for those that think that way.Is it the best movie of the year? Maybe, maybe not but it deserves it's awards and every piece of positive praise it gets. Don't even get me started on the dog (and I'm not a 'pet person' in the slightest) but he deserves an Oscar too.Fabulous all round old fashioned feel good movie. I loved it-You will too.",9,4,10,27 February 2012
The Green Mile," Another period prison based Darabont masterpiece!
","In every way, this is a wonderful film and IMO deserves a rare 10/10 because it's hard personally for me to see how it could have been made any better. Hugely touching, emotive on every human level, a brilliant storyline, by all accounts a faithful screenplay and wonderfully cast. It's long, but the time flies.Hanks is superb here as is the inspired choice of Michael Clarke Duncan and in fact all of the cast. Even the mouse was brilliant!SPOILERS:It's the story of a simple man wrongly convicted of the worst type of crime. Set in a time where there is no real recourse to justice for such men and with a subplot that becomes the main focus of the film. Is John Coffey a gift from God and if so why are we allowing him to be legally murdered? That he ultimately doesn't mind, doesn't ease Paul's pain or the viewers pain at what we are watchingBoth Bitterbuck and Delacroix will make you question the death penaltyPercy's grossly offensive behaviour will make you question your humanity Paul Edgecomb will make you realise what a fantastically emotive actor Tom Hanks is and Duncan's John Coffey will make you weepHats off to you Mr Darabont once again and thank you for a truly beautiful film.",10,16,20,14 June 2011
Jackie Brown," Quality from QT
","Although not one of QT's most talked about works, Jackie Brown is Tarantino at his best. Everything about this movie works. From the start, with it's long following shot of Pam Grier walking along in her Flight Attendants uniform, Jackie Brown is primarily character driven. It doesn't seek to be action or fantasy orientated, it's not gung-ho or overly clever and there are no mystery sub plots where the viewer has to wait for the end for the pieces to be tied together, (although there is some beautifully crafted surprises along the way). It's just a great character driven 'book' brought to life by the master of dialogue rich films. Sure it's violent in places, it's an homage to the blaxploitation films of American urban 70's low life after all, but throughout, it's theme is simply what happens to Jackie. A hard working but lonely, although still beautiful middle aged woman who's life has inexplicably passed her by and her attempt to augment her low wage and raise her low self esteem with some easy ill-gotten gains, the police investigation into what happens after and an unlikely but very believable mixed race pseudo-romance with a white bail bondsman. What intricacies there are to the plot, features incredible supporting roles from Robert De Niro, Brigit Fonda and Samuel Jackson amongst others. All of whom are exceptional here.The musical score throughout is perfect (as always with QT) and in the end, the ultimate pay off being that although Jackie Brown gets away with it and the bad guys are gone, her crime means that she has to walk away (well drive away) from her chance of happiness.Great film, great cast, great score and great fun. More like a 10/10 than a 9/10",9,0,0,11 November 2011
Donnie Darko," Incredible mind trip-A must see (again and again!)
","It's taken me 5 years to finally 'get' this movie and now I don't know how (although I always liked it), I never really fully appreciated it before. Talk about waiting for the penny to drop! It has to be watched in it's entirety with a completely open mind. If you are one of those people that makes up their mind about a film after a few minutes, Donnie Darko is not for you, but then you'd also be missing out on Mulholland Drive, Twelve Monkeys and other genius mind bending work of celluloid art that will pass you by. Your loss. Where this is unique (amongst those other greats) is in it's sheer complexity and that is also where it will lose viewers, but if any film ever deserves to be repeatedly viewed, analysed and savoured, all for the ultimate goal of simply understanding it, this is it.It may take repeated viewings, much debate and many years (as in my case) to understand it all, but Donnie Darko is an absolute work of art that should be seen by everyone who loves clever and thought provoking film.Utterly phenomenal.",10,1,3,1 July 2009
V for Vendetta," One of the coolest movies I've ever seen
","Other than everything Kurosawa's ever done, I am rarely amazed by how much a film can impact me nowadays, but every time this is on the film channels I find myself watching it (and I own the DVD anyway). It's such an inspirational, entertaining and damn cool movie that any plot holes it may have (Portman's voice perhaps) just don't matter.I've read as many of the reviews as I can manage and thankfully most people get it too, but for those that don't, I can't offer any words of comfort. It's simply a hugely uplifting movie carried by the coolest character you will ever see on film and if you don't enjoy it, all I can think of is that you are either one of those people that hates film transfers of your beloved graphic novels or you are trying to read too much into the politics or the symbolism of the film. If you just sit back and watch the movie, I fail to see how you wouldn't just love it.A wonderful masterpiece of a film",10,3,9,14 February 2008
The Godfather," The film is the star
","Often cited as the greatest film ever made, I can't 100% agree with that but along with it's immense sequel, it is certainly 'one' of the greatest ever made. Like all celluloid masterpieces, it doesn't date. Sure some cinematic techniques alter, sound, lighting, colour and camera-work vary over the years, perhaps they're improved in general but these are transitional and often just fashionable points, not a reflection on the quality of a film.The Godfather is a ground breaking film. Slow, complex and often with no attempt to educate the audience into the 'whys' of what is happening, you're simply invited to draw your own conclusions into the right and wrongs of this world and the characters within it. But the story itself is pure genius. Vicious yet measured, vengeful yet honourable, people centred yet set in a world where self appointed royalty are all powerful. It's a ride, rarely if ever bettered.Sometimes a star makes a film, other times a film makes the star (and actually that might be true for Al Pacino here) but in The Godfather we have a film that is the star itself. It's not really possible to pick out stand-out performances without citing them all. That is what makes it one of the very best of all time and a must see for anyone with the slightest interest in the history of Cinema.",Null,1,3,16 November 2011
