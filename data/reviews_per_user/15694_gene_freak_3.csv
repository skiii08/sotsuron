Requiem for a Dream," R-Rated Afterschool Special
","Hollywood's gratuitous attempt at an anti-drug message showcases an array of characters (you're bound to relate to one of them) in a this-is-your-brain, this-is-your-brain-on-drugs kind of way. You watch it and think, hey if I was and so-and-so, my-brain-not-on-drugs was the way to go!However, if you have any remote sense of logic, then you don't actually have to endure the film to figure that out.There's a gritty, depersonalizing element to the film which adds style and extreme worst-case-scenario scares, but overall, it's got that afterschool special obviousness - drugs are bad!When it's over, you expect the guy with the eggs and frying pan to lurch out and say, 'Any questions?'",1,28,58,13 April 2006
Jerry Maguire," Crowe's descent
","Man's mid-life crisis with a LifeTime made-for-TV agenda.Men - don't you realize that football is just an angle to get you to watch this pitiful soap opera, complete with the peskiest most-corny-made-for TV kid ever, a divorced womens' support group (does this tell you ANYTHING?) A hockey player's kid gives him a dirty look, so he promptly abandons his successful life for sensitivity. Realizes he's been living...gasp!...a lie! Duh! You're an agent! Propaganda bothers you NOW? From here on, Jerry's life is like a bad makeover show.Women - did you actually fall for this 'romance?' Renee Zellweger on a plane trying to catch an eyeful of Tom Cruise while (I daresay BECAUSE) she has to get a barfbag for her 'scene-stealing' cheeseball version of a son. Yeah, who wouldn't want a way out of THAT LIFE. She pathetically fawns over him, he inexplicably likes the kid, therefore her. By PROXIMITY. You should be offended.Sadly, I actually like Cameron Crowe; he's a capable filmmaker who unfortunately decided to do what everyone else is doing - go mainstream with big names, clich√©s, and dumbed-down big-budget fluff.",1,42,82,3 July 2005
A Walk to Remember," Manipulative LifeTime Quality
","Half generic teen movie, half manipulative wanna-be tear-jerker, this piece of crap and fluff tries to showcase whitebread Mandy Moore's average singing abilities.As recommended by her image consultant, Moore plays a dull goody-two-shoes character so puritanically over the top that God Himself has to resist the persistent urge to just snatch her up to Heaven at any given time.To further cement her ridiculously caricaturish nature, she dresses just like your grandmother.When Shane West needs her help with his lines for the dumb play he's forced to star in, of course she'll help! She spends all her free time helping everybody! 'Just don't fall in love with me...' AWWW! Guess what happens?(Insert token scene of him blowing her off in the hallway, because all his friends make fun of her)Her supreme goodness predictably makes him a better person. Awww!I did cry at the part where the holy prude stayed out late with good-for-nothing Landon (don't worry, she's saving herself for marriage, duh!) and her preacher dad actually says 'Your behavior is sinful!' I was laughing THAT hard!What a joke! At this point, I knew there were only 2 ways the movie could go - either she gets accepted and made-over, or she dies all young and pure.I was expecting a Vatican conference and canonization ceremony at the end, but had to settle for the lame voice-over about their short time together, etc. Yawn. But you can always buy Mandy Moore CDs and know just what an angel from the Lord sounds like!",1,41,80,13 April 2006
