Sucker Punch," Enjoyable if not strange and slightly confusing...
","***This review contains spoilers***Sucker Punch. The main reason I was waiting for this film to release was that one of my favourite bands was supposed to have a song on its soundtrack...which it didn't in the end. From the start, I went into this with high hopes, the trailer looked great. Not your usual film. Charlies Angels meets One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest. It is strange and if you miss the beginning, you will get lost and confused. Emily Browning played the main role of Babydoll. A girl who accidentally killed her own sister while trying to kill her abusive father. Placed in a sanitarium, she overhears that she is to be lobotomized. This is where it gets...confusing and strange. In her head, there are 3 worlds. Reality, a private strip club and a fantasy war zone. In order to escape the hospital, she retreats into these alternate realities in her mind to help. She is helped by 4 friends, also inmates in the sanitarium. Abbie Cornish(Sweat Pea), Jena Malone(Rocket), Vanessa Hudgens(Blondie) and Jamie Chung(Amber). All 4 fairly well established in TV and film. The acting of all 5 of these actors was good. Especially that of Emily Browning.The Fight scenes are great. Special Effects also great. I have never seen a film like this before, and that is a good thing. Many films these days are simply rebooting or remaking old films because they can't think of anything that has not already been done. This film is New. Original. Unique. Took some guts to spend so much money on a project like this, so well done to them.To end it, although for some this film may be just too strange and confusing, it is still well worth a watch.",7,3,5,15 January 2012
Ender's Game," Enders end game a surprise.
","Will admit from the start that I never read the book. So, I won't be one of those 'Oh I read the book, here are all the differences that ruined the film'. Instead this will be about the film itself. No spoilers.When I first heard of this film I thought it would be another one of those 'Underdog' films. And it was. They don't always work, but this one got it right. Enders (Asa Butterfield) was a great choice. His acting will surly give him a decent future. The main reason for me watching this was of course, Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford). An uptight, ridged 'bleep' whose only thought is of his planet. No possibly or maybe. Black and white do or die attitude. Ball Breaker. Different role that I am used to seeing him in, but great none the less. Even the short role by Ben Kingsley was good. Most of the other cast was young and relatively unknown, but every one of them added to the movie is a good way.The training scenes were brilliant, just like you would imagine a military school to be like, except in space. The battle scenes, although few, were great. I can't actually fault the film. The end was surprising, not how I expected it to go. The very end though...not sure if it was left open for a sequel or a bit of a let down. Which is why it didn't get a 10. Overall though, very good film.",9,2,3,17 July 2014
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," A LOT better than I expected!
","Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Must admit, There are not many remakes or reboots that I like. BUT, this is one of those exceptions. The 2001 film 'Planet of the Apes' was an okay remake of the original 1968 film staring Charlton Heston. This movie is a reboot of the 1983 film, 'Conquest of the Planet of the Apes. Fourth film in the series line. Although it does has similarities to 'Conquest', it is NOT a remake, which is good. I can honestly say I don't know what I expected from this film. Disappointed by recent reboots/remakes, I in part expected not to like it. I could not have been more wrong. James Franco, best known for his staring role in 127 Hours. He plays Will Rodman, Genetic Engineer looking for a cure for Alzheimer's disease. A good part and well acted. Freida Pinto, known mainly for her lead female role in Slumdog Millionaire. She plays a primatologist who bonds with Will Rodman and Caesar. The voice of Caesar is played by Andy Serkis who has done many voice overs, including Gollum from Lord of the Rings.The Special Effects of the film were just great. The acting and storyline are superb. I don't want to give spoilers in this review because I think it is a brilliant film and I suggest people watch the film instead of reading all the spoilers.Now, According to reports, this film will be the first in the line of a new series of Planet of the Apes films. :D So, we can hope that the future has some very good films to come. One last comment. Roddy McDowall was brilliant in his roles in all the original films as Cornelius in films 1&3 and Caesar in 4&5.",9,1,2,15 January 2012
The Lives of Others," Sat with a smile on my face!
","Just finished watching this film and I have to say it was fantastic. I'm a man that watches all sorts of films. Sci-fi, comedy, fantasy, action etc. But I rarely watch European cinema or subtitled films. But this...it blew me away at how good it was.The acting by all the cast was great, Martina Gedeck, Sebastian Koch...just brilliant, but Ulrich MÃ¼he, top performance as the Stasi officer. I don't want to add spoilers, but I I will say this, Out of the thousands of films I've seen, this is one of the best! A must watch for anyone, even if you don't usually watch subtitled films!",9,5,7,30 April 2014
Super 8," Super Great!!
","Super 8. If like me you loved the movies of the 80s, this will be one for you. If not, you will still love it. It's like a cross between The Goonies and Cloverfield. One of the best Sci-fi films released in while. If you are not into sci-fi, I still think you will enjoy it. Set in the summer of '79, in and around the small fictional town of Lillian, Ohio. The films focus is on a group of kids are making a school film. During which something happens that changes everything for them and their town for ever. Now, I have looked at what some on here have said and I can not believe the overall rating is just 7.6! If you want constant sci-fi action, stick to Star Wars. The is a brilliantly written and made film and has no need to rush through it.Fun, dramatic, special effects...This film has one of, if not THE best Special Effect moments in many years. The Train Crash. I was actually sat there, open mouthed going 'wow' while watching it. Most of the acting in this film is done by young teenagers such Joel Courtney and Riley Griffiths, their first ever big screen roles and were great as they all were. The most known, to me, adult actor was Kyle Chandler who plays Deputy Sheriff Jackson Lamb. He is probably best know for his staring role in the series 'Early Edition'. His acting, as always, was spot on.To end, if I have to suggest a film to watch made in 2011, it will be this one.",9,2,5,10 January 2012
Thor," Odin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","Thor. Really liked the first 30 minutes. Brilliant. As in most Marvel films, Stan Lee, who created the characters, has a cameo roles. Of course he didn't create the character Thor, but he did create the comic book version. I like this film as it keeps in line with Norse mythology. No fiddling with it. Anthony Hopkins played a great role of the God Odin, Ruler of Asgard. Chris Hemsworth, a relative newcomer to Hollywood. I, for one, had never seen or heard of him and only just found out he played Captain George Kirk in the 2009 Star Trek film. Of course, you can not have Thor and Odin without the mischievous Loki, played brilliantly by Tom Hiddleston also a relative newcomer to Hollywood films. Also, all three of these top roles were played by an Englishmen, a Welshman and an Australian. Sounds like the beginning of a joke. But this film was far from it. The Special Effects are just amazing. Could not ask for more. Acting, including those previously mentioned...superb. Also could not ask for more. This is truly one of the best films of 2011 and I can not wait for Thor to return in The Avengers and Thor 2. To be released in 2012 and 2013. Amazing film, a definite watch.",10,1,3,11 January 2012
