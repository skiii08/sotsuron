The Blair Witch Project," Spare me
","First of all, this is not an innovative film - nor is it the ultimate in film making as my best friend tried to claim.  There was no art to it - no creativity.  This nothing more than a gimmick flick that directs itself (a novelty if you will), and would have bombed if not for hype and gullible people.  Anybody and their brother can hand a few kids some cameras, give them a sketch of a script, and scare the you-know-what out of them. Where's the art in that?  To me, it's no different than tossing paint at a canvas and calling it a stroke of genius.  And as far as defying horror conventions, it's still just a bunch of dumb kids running around the forest making bad decisions.  The only thing missing is the guy in the hockey mask...",Null,0,0,30 September 1999
Mulan," Wretched Music and Plot
","Two of the key ingredients of a good Disney movie are a good musical score and villain.  Both are completely lacking here.  Most songs are painful to listen to and don't work together to create a cohesive sound for the film (ie. the tribal beats of Lion King or the more tropical feel of The Little Mermaid).  Only Reflection lives up to the Disney standard.  In fact, the only song that has a distinctly Asian flavor is the worst of the bunch. And then we have our villain - who does nothing but glare and grunt.  Not quite as appealing as Scar or Ursula or Maleficent or any of the wonderful Disney villains.  Sure the film has a great message but I've seen better films with the very same one.  It certainly isn't better than The Lion King.  Maybe if they played it straight without the cheesy songs it may have been better or at least better-written ones with a more exotic sound befitting the locale.",Null,0,3,30 September 1999
American Beauty," This deserves an Oscar?!
","There were so many things that were wrong with this movie I can't understand why it's been so massively embraced.  For one, film makers kept switching back and forth between satire and realism so often it made my head spin, and hurt the realism of the film overall.  It didn't help that only half of the characters were at all developed.  The mom in particular barely seemed human except for a few brief moments that left me unconvinced.  In addition, some scenes were so contrived they could have come straight from be grade B sitcom, only with grim consequences.  Not only that but I felt that certain plot devises insulted my intelligence.  In the beginning, they make you think that things are going to be one way but then they present two other possibilities.  Only one of the three makes enough sense to be what's going to happen so I found it greatly irritating every time they tried to lead me in the wrong direction.  I saw certain things coming a mile away so I was in awe when other people were so surprised.  Not to mention that the re-occurring motif with all the red was hardly inspired.  It's been done. I didn't feel uplifted when I left the film either, only disgusted.  But Oscar does love pretension so I'm sure this movie will sweep and annoy the you-know-what out of me again.",Null,0,1,2 October 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," An over-rated audio-visual assault
","Yeah I know, it's one of the best movies and by one of the most important directors of all time.  And I also know that as a film student, it's my duty to like it.  Well sorry, I didn't.  (No disrespect to the dearly departed Kubrick; this is just my humble opinion.)Lucky me, I got to see 2001 in its entirety within a theatrical setting (ie. seated in a hard, uncomfortable chair with the sound at full blast but only one chance to take a bathroom break) for a film course I took last semester.Now had I seen it in the comfort of my own home with the ability to turn down the sound or move about as I pleased, then maybe I would have been able to appreciate the film.  Instead, I spent most of the 3 or so hours with my hands over my ears or my eyes squeezed shut wishing that someone would be kind enough to put me out of my misery.  By the time I left the auditorium, I was nauseous and suffering from a splitting headache.In addition, I can't imagine why past critics were so puzzled about the film's theme since its just about visually beaten into the audience within the first 20 minutes, which could have easily been reduced to five.  Okay, okay.  Technology bad.  Tree pretty (inside joke).  I get it already.  Now can someone pass me an aspirin?",Null,2,3,6 September 1999
The Sixth Sense," Double wow
","Who knew Bruce Willis could act?  I had 0 interest in seeing this film, and it is now right up there with Contact as one of my all-time favorites.  I can't understand why this movie gets compared with Blair Witch all the time. For one, I wouldn't classify it as horror.  What it really is is a supernatural thriller that touches upon drama and endearing comic moments, all-the-while employing all that is wonderful and good about film making to create a touching and memorable movie, whereas Blair Witch is nothing than an over-rated novelty.The filming, the acting, the script - everything is virtually flawless here. While it does have a startling plot twist, the strong story and well-developed characters prevent this from becoming just another gimmick-flick.  And Haley isn't just good for a little boy - he's just plain GOOD.  You don't often find that much charisma in someone so young.  To me, this movie is the perfect blend of art an entertainment.  It's also another one of the few films to actually make me cry - three times no less.We can only hope that Bruce Willis will keep up the good work.  I have my fingers crossed.",10,0,0,29 September 1999
Contact," Beautiful and thought-provoking
","Towards the climactic ending, Contact was this close to alienating me but then it turned out that what I thought I was seeing really wasn't what I thought at all.  That very same scene then makes me cry.  Sorry to be so vague but I'm being careful not to ruin it.  Contact isn't just some boring sci-fi flick like most similar movies.  Instead it tackles the issues of religion and science in an inspired plot that reaches an ambiguous conclusion which will satisfy any train of thought, religious, scientific, or if you're like me - indifferent.  I found it to be one of the most moving and breathtaking films I've ever seen, putting it right up there with The Sixth Sense in my eyes.  It may not be for everyone but it spoke to me on a deeper level.  I'm not one to cry easily.  Jody Foster is truly one of the most talented women in Hollywood.",10,0,1,29 September 1999
