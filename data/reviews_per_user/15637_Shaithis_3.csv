The Blair Witch Project," Hyped To No End.
","I am afraid the Blair Witch Project has become a victim of it's own hype. 
This film is in my opinion a refreshing burst of energy injected into the horror film.  Something I haven't seen since 'The Evil Dead' came out.Original and mysterious, this film pulled me along for the ride quite easily.  Unfortunately I started to expect a little too much from this film because of all the talk about this film.  I wanted and expected more.It is a great film, but I am afraid it is not something I will be able to watch over and over again.  It has been marketed to death and the hype surrounding it has annoyed me to the point where I would rather ignore this film for a while.",7,0,1,13 January 2000
Army of Darkness," A Classic Movie, Give Us Some More Sugar Baby.
","I hope director Sam Raimi is not finished with the Evil Dead series. Sure his Hercules and Xena Warrior Princess shows are doing great, but nothing is quite like his Evil Dead Series.Army of Darkness takes us to medieval times (a continuation of where Evil Dead 2 left off) where Ash has become known as the promised one who will rid the people of this time of all the dead that have risen from the grave.This film was called 'Army Of Darkness' because this was the first Evil Dead movie that had a wide theatrical release. They didn't want movie goers skipping it because they hadn't seen the previous two. It does stand by itself, but I would recommend following the whole series. They changed the beginning of this film a bit from the ending of the Evil Dead 2. Where in Evil Dead 2 Ash falls through the rip in time, and is instantly saluted as the promised one, he is now thought to be an enemy. He has to prove himself to the population first.  Unfortunate, but I'm sure it made a better storyline. The rest of the movie is a classic horror/comedy. Sam Raimi has invented an entire new genre with the Evil Dead series. It's a fun movie that has clever little things inside. For instance the chant 'Klaatu Verada Nicto' taken from The Day The Earth Stood Still. H. P. Lovecraft's Necronomicon, and copies of Fangoria magazine are all little things that made this movie fun for me.This is the American version however, and was altered. The main difference was the ending. The ending was too depressing for U.S. audiences according to the movie studios, so they changed it. That is unfortunate. Hopefully they will release the international version.",10,2,3,13 January 2000
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Great Chemistry Between Actors In Nightmare.
","The film that started it all...and this was no comic Freddy either. Freddy's introduction to the world was as dark as his past.  He didn't crack a joke in every appearance...he killed!
The first Nightmare film was original.  Others will copy this format over and over again...including Mr. Craven himself (Shocker).  Heather Langenkamp, Amanda Wyss and Johnny Depp were  great unknown actors in this film.  You can't really cast any better for this type of film.  It was also great to see horror great John Saxon reappear on the screen.The chemistry flows nicely throughout the film.  At times, Langenkamp seems to be talking to herself and not the actor she is supposed to, but overall it's one great scare.  Wyss played a great sexy little friend of Langenkamp's and her scene-stealing death scene is one of the greatest of all time.  The fact that when you were hurt in your dreams, you were hurt in real life has opened the imagination for many.  While it may not be totally original (H.P. Lovecraft's dreamland's novels used this to a limited degree), it did introduce it to a wide audience.On such a limited budget, Craven and his group did a wonderful job keeping the effects realistic and the story great!",9,0,0,11 January 2000
