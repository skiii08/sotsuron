Ford v Ferrari," Lost opportunity
","Disappointed ! Matt Damon might be a good actor but the script he was given is a dud. Childish arguments repeating throughout remind me of the 1968 Elvis movie Speedway more than a story depicting greats like Carol Shelby and Henry Ford 2. Having said that is is structured so that once you are sitting there watching you want to see the outcome, even though you know how it ends. There must have been 20 minutes wasted looking at the side of Christian Bales head while driving, with a competitor in the background moving back and forward in an unrealistic manner. The Butterworth boys would have done well to actually go to a race track and watch at least one car race. How many minutes watching a foot on a brake pedal and accelarator do we need to waste ? Surprisingly one of my friends has been to this movie 4 times, but he is a car guy, not a movie buff. It will appeal to Donald Trump voters I suspect.",3,6,17,3 December 2019
