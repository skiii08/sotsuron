Walk the Line," 'We surrender! We surrender! - Y'all can't walk no line!'
","It doesn't matter how much you enjoy country music or particularly, Johnny Cash as a singer, you won't regret about your popcorn and time.
I put 10 out of 10 to this film with no doubt. I started to watch Walk the Line with some hesitation; I was sure that this film would be a failure for me. I do not like country music, I do not like biographical films and I do not like the cast. I watched it in deep night and after watching I couldn't fall asleep, I was really shocked by this film, there were so many thoughts in my head. It is the rare movie that succeeds on every level, where each character, scene, costume firing on all cylinders to make a film worth repeated viewings. I can say with 100% sureness that this film is on the first place in my own list of favorites. 
Walk the Line is a 2005 American biographical drama film directed by James Mangold. The film follows Cash's early life, his romance with June Carter, and his ascent to the country music scene.
This film was nominated for five Oscars at the 78th Academy Awards, including Best Actor (Phoenix), Best Actress (Witherspoon, which she won) and Best Costume Design (Arianna Phillips).
Walk the Line is full of wonderful characters like Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon, Ginnifer Goodwin, Robert Patrick and Dallas Roberts. Frankly speaking, I have known nothing about background of Joaquin Phoenix, I don't remember any film with his acting and that's why only after this film, I opened him as an actor. As for Reese Witherspoon, I consider her as a average actress who is good at silly American comedies and I absolutely failed. I couldn't pull my eyes from her during the whole story. Phoenix and Witherspoon were very convincing. Their acting was well acted and they managed to add a lot to the film itself, they did a very good job.
Speaking about the plot, it was amusing and in some way even unbelievable. When I was watching the film, I felt empathy to the main characters. This film is a biographical drama that means it is a real story about real people and their experience and it shocks me a lot. The plot is full of tension and unexpected plot twists. As this film is about the important part in developing of country music, the music itself supports the plot. The music underlines a mood, evokes feelings and of course shows characters' emotions. 
I strongly recommend this film to everybody, it is a worthwhile watch. If you like emotionally strong film, be sure, you will like it!",10,0,0,4 March 2018
