Skyfall," Skyfall in IMAX
","Skyfall in IMAX was a blast. You should all know, however, that this movie was not originally shot with IMAX cameras, it was converted after the fact. The result was still amazing though. While not as crystal clear as movies actually shot on IMAX, we still get to see 26% more of the original captured footage. The IMAX experience of Skyfall was definitely worth it, with the huge picture and extremely loud and immersive surround sound. From all the reviews out there already, I was expecting this Bond to go a little deeper emotionally, psychologically, and historically into Bond and M's back-stories. You do get a little new material as far as the characters are concerned though. Instead, we get a really good action movie. I appreciated that Skyfall had a slower, more in-control pace unlike Quantum of Solace which, while enjoyable, was just action scene after action scene. The action in Skyfall ranges from fast and chaotic to slow and jazzy like an old school spy movie. I did notice that there was a serious lack of shaky camera movement. For several of the fights you can actually tell who is hitting who and what kind of moves they are doing. It was refreshing. The cinematography was beautiful and took advantage of all the filming locations. The surround sound was exciting. And the music had its own touch while throwing in deliciously generous bouts of the original Bond music. There are several nods to older Bond movies that were fun to discover and at the same time the movie fits in perfect with Craig's other two outings as 007 with his same character continuing to grow and learn. The main bad guy wasn't too scary in my opinion. His quirks almost make you like him. He is definitely evil, but I was never really afraid of him. He did an amazing job and was a different take, so that was nice. Last but not least, how is this movie content/parental concern-wise? It deserved the PG-13 rating it received. Going into Skyfall I was a bit nervous about all the sex scenes and opening music sequence that Bond movies always have. The sex scenes were basically what you see in the trailers with just a few more seconds of footage. The opening musical credit sequence also was not that bad, you definitely don't see as much as in other Bond movies. There were a few outlines of obviously naked women, but they were brief and not that detailed. As Far as violence is concerned, it was PG-13 spy violence with lots of gunshots and punching and explosions etc. Nothing too graphic here. (No naked torture scenes like in Casino Royale). And there was one 'F-word' which was actually not that clearly uttered. Other than that, the rest of the swearing was far below normal PG-13 par. Thanks for reading, now go enjoy another awesome Bond movie!",8,3,14,8 November 2012
