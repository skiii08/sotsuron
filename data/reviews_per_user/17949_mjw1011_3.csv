The Avengers," Avengers review
","I'm not going to try to win everyone over by giving my review a cheesy over-done headline. I'm not also going to try to persuade you by comparing this movie to Christopher Nolan's Batman movies. I am a fan of both DC and Marvel Comics. when people do so, it drives me nuts. So I'm not going to give a review bashing the other like a lot of 'fans' on here. so that being said; The Avengers is a great movie. All the movies that lead up to this film made this one a fantastic start to what could be an even better new saga. From the get-go, this movie starts out with what the rest of it will bring. I for one think sometimes 2 1/2 hours for a movie is a little drawn out, and very few times i have sat through a movie that long and felt I was short changed. It is very entertaining, very funny, and full of action. Joss Whedon truly lifted these characters from the pages of the comic into real life. Go see the movie, I saw it in 3-D IMAX, but to be honest any form of this movie is going to be just as great. If you enjoyed the last (actual) Marvel movies that lead us to this point, you definitely wont be disappointed.Stay for at least the first after credit footage, If you're an Avenger comic fan like I am, you will grin from ear to ear.",10,1,4,6 May 2012
Evil Dead," Totally uninspired, falls flat on all aspects.
","Before I begin my review, I just want to say that I was one of the few who is a fan of the originals, who looked forward too/had an open mind about this remake/reboot/re-visioning (whatever the hell you perceive it to be). Let me also add that I did not let it affect me to bash this movie simply because there was no Bruce Campbell in the starring role or Sam Raimi to direct it. With the title of this review being said, This movie was HORRIBLE. When I say it fell flat on all aspects I truly mean it. 1. Story. The good part is its a story of 5 friends that go to a cabin in the woods. Not for the partying and fun like the original. The main character, David, goes to this retreat in the hopes of helping his sister become clean of drugs. it is then you find out it this cabin is a place where a lot of their childhood took place, but when their mother died, the less and less they visited and became a place where locals came to perform an exorcism on a local girl who was possessed by demons that surrounded the forest.That is where David along with friend Eric, discover under the storage cellar, where ritual took place because of constantly smelling an odor. That is where they discover a room where Carcasses of cats were hanging. They come across a book that is wrapped up in a trash bag, and tightly wound Barbed wire. eager to find out what it is Eric discovers it is the book of the dead. He reads a summon out loud (Even though the book clearly states that no one should even acknowledge it.) which wakens the demon. which (of course) possesses Mia (the recovering drug addict.) so when weird things start happening to her of course everyone makes it out to be her withdrawal that are making her neurotic. OK that's enough. I don't really have to go any further for you to guess what happens. that being said that is pretty much the same premise as the original. Although there is similarities, over all it falls short of inspiring. the movie moves at a pace where you watch about 40 minutes of it and you still don't know any of the characters names, or even want to care about them. There was absolutely no substance to the story telling. maybe that's because you focus so much on the original, or because this writer/director just butchered the hell out of this remake to make it his own, you just stop caring and you just want to get to the good stuff2. Special effects ('the good stuff') The great thing about the original was the low budget and the on screen effects that Raimi used. Well obviously the bigger the budget, the more fun you can have right? I read other reviews, where people said what makes this movie great is the on screen effects and the minimal use of CGI. Whoever said this is a joke all in its own. The on screen effects were just as bad if not worse the actual good abundance of CGI used. The CGI used looked so fake and cheesy, I cant believe other viewers looked at it as if they couldn't notice. The overuse of fake blood made this movie go from bad to worse. 3. What they did right Believe me when I say this. There was very, and I mean very little that they did right. there was minor homage to the original, like the random appearances of the 'boom stick,' Ash's chainsaw hand, the cameraman running though forest representing the presence of the demon. But honestly that is all I can think of. My conclusion? Skip it. I literally asked myself: What the hell did I just watch? You would think if you were pay any homage to the original by making a remake or reboot, you do it the right way. But in a sense, is there really a right way to do a reboot? rarely anyone walks out of the theater satisfied. They just get mad that someone tried to fix something that did not need fixing. I know the reason for remakes, but i laughed at all the teenagers that walked out of the theater saying how horrifying the movie was. Some of which never knew this was a remake of an old movie. like I did through out this movie all I did was laugh and shake my head. Skip it save your money. Pop in the original and appreciate it.",1,65,131,15 April 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Temper your hopes, The dark knight barely rises to the occasion.
","While there was some good to the movie, there was just too many things that i feel were wrong. And it makes me wonder did I see the same movie as everyone else? as i said the bad outweighed the good. and although i did like many things, I came out of the movie somewhat disappointed. First what i liked. A lot of Bane's characteristics were kept in. Nolan took it in a way that it should. Although he has the strength, it's his intelligence that makes him a threat. Hs voice is a little off putting at first but as time goes on it really fits the character. Anne Hathaway was a great catwoman. Everyone had their doubts but she pulled it off. she really pulled away from her previous work to really show what talent she's capable of. Now what is bad, is this movie takes place 8 yrs after the dark knight. Nolan puts too much origin this movie, he tries to develop a character we are all to familiar with. and Being Bruce Wayne called it quits after two years of being batman there really wasn't a whole lot to tell in this origin. 'The breaking the bat scene' seemed to go under the radar and should have been more cinematic then it was. It was really disappointing and happened way to early in the movie. Christopher Nolan also uses elements of Bane's origin for Talia's character in the movie, and hardly goes into Bane's origin at all. Lastly STOP READING NOW IF YOU Don't WANT THE ULTIMATE SPOILER! The Robin reveal was the most unnecessary and most anti-climatic ending that they could have done away with. There was absolutely no reason to add it, especially when Nolan said no more bat movies will be made and Christian Bale told us he would not do a bat movie if robin was in any part of it. Im giving this movie a very low 7, i would give a 6.5 but since you cant i rounded up.",7,1,8,23 July 2012
