Vertigo," Fascinating, personal, but not Hitchcock's finest
","This is without question one of Hollywood's most beautiful and original films of the 1950s, but its thin story leads to some unevenness.The first half consists mainly of Stewart following Novak around San Francisco -- as another poster comments, 'I hope you like shots of people driving.' It's fairly mysterious and beautifully shot, but awfully leisurely. For once in Hitchcock (as sometimes in the work of younger directors like Scorsese and DePalma, who idolize this film) one feels there's more style here than substance.Hitchcock had a perverse love for process shots; luckily in this film they are first-rate. If the automobile process shots had been as bad here as in some of his pictures, the first hour of VERTIGO would have been hard to take.(Spoilers begin here.) Then there's the abrupt revelation to the audience of what's really been going on, handled a bit awkwardly by Novak having a sort of vision. There's Stewart's nightmare, which looks dated now. Then the film speeds through the Judy section to the exciting ending -- here the pace seems too fast, as it seemed too slow in the first half of the story.These quibbles aside, much of the film is truly brilliant. I don't understand why anyone complains about Novak's superb, tense, even profound performance. It may be the deepest female character, and performance, in any Hitchcock film. Every moment of it feels right and rings true in the film's dream-like context.James Stewart, one of Hollywood's finest leading men, outdoes himself here, taking his beloved 'everyman' persona into dangerous new areas: naked anguish, self-torture, sadism. I can't think of a single Hollywood leading man today who could pull off such a risky, emotionally-exposed performance. The unexpected depth and perfection of Novak's and Stewart's performances are major reasons for this film's high rating.Overall VERTIGO is brilliant, a masterpiece, so it's easy to forgive Hitchcook for a few sequences that drag. Maybe the draggy pace even contributes to one's sense that the film is a vivid dream -- or a nightmare.",8,2,5,1 August 2004
The Aviator," Episodic bio-pic never really adds up
","Over 2000 years ago Aristotle observed that a selection of true incidents from someone's life doesn't necessarily add up to an effective story. THE AVIATOR proves Aristotle's point.Here's a movie that takes a lot of really interesting people and makes them -- not very interesting. The weakness is mainly the superficial script, which covers Hughes the aviation pioneer (much of this is quite exciting), Hughes the Hollywood producer (this is sketchy and disjointed), Hughes the womanizer (sketchy and uninvolving), and Hughes the obsessive-compulsive eccentric -- but never quite succeeds in pulling all these elements into a persuasive whole.At the end of this very, very long film, I didn't really *feel* anything about Hughes, either positive or negative. He seems as cold and remote at the end as at the beginning and the last hour drags.What Scorcese needed was a screenplay that would make us care about Hughes -- either love him or hate him -- the way CITIZEN KANE does. But THE AVIATOR is no KANE. It tries to cover too much, and you never really know why some things were included and others omitted; the result is the incidents covered seem shallow, obvious, and quickly glossed-over.Still, there are a number of excellent scenes in the film. My favorite is Hughes' visit to Katherine Hepburn's family, where her relations -- as headstrong and self-involved as she is -- treat him with hilarious rudeness.I should confess I have a problem with DiCaprio: I have trouble accepting him as a grown-up. He always seems to me like a 14 year-old boy playing an adult in a junior High School play. He's a pretty good actor; he applies himself and he's quite talented. I don't know why that boyish thing bothers me, just as it did in TITANIC, where Kate Winslett seemed more like his aunt than his lover.Even Scorcese's period mise en scene fails to persuade. The sets and costumes are all so colorful, so squeaky-clean, they seem made for a musical comedy rather than a serious period drama. And Scorcese makes too many obvious choices, such as the movie Hughes watches that convinces him the public now wants sound films. Of course it's THE JAZZ SINGER.As in NEW YORK, NEW YORK, there's a ton of painstaking period detail, but it doesn't ring true. You don't feel you're really in the 1930s and 40s, any more than you believe Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow. Cate Blanchett tries a little too hard as Katherine Hepburn, though it's basically an intelligent and effective performance. Her strenuous efforts to imitate Hepburn's well-known vocal mannerisms are distracting at times.So I can see why THE AVIATOR lit no fires either at the box office or at the Oscars. A huge amount of work and money went into a film that is frequently interesting, but finally not all that compelling.",5,5,10,1 August 2005
Downfall," The best World War 2 epic ever?
","Let me echo others in saying I know no greater film about World War 2. DOWNFALL is so brilliantly conceived, so perfectly written and acted, and so uncompromisingly probing and honest, it makes SAVING PRIVATE RYAN look adolescent by comparison.It's miraculous how DOWNFALL avoids the easy answers and typical agendas one finds in books and films about this period, opting to show all sides of one of history's most dramatic and troubling episodes. The bloodiest war in human history is grinding to a close, and YOU ARE THERE. Modern parallels abound ... something very much like this probably happened in Iraq, as Saddam held on till the bitter end.The film's use of violence is truly commendable -- there is exactly enough to grip and shock us, where appropriate, but never the gratuitous gore-for-its-own sake that one finds even in Spielberg's battle scenes.DOWNFALL recalls Woodrow Wilson's reaction to Griffith's BIRTH OF A NATION: 'it's like writing history with lightning.' The writing and the acting, especially Bruno Ganz's towering, fully-dimensional portrait of Hitler, should win every award there is. Previous film Hitlers have been paper tigers, melodramatic villains, but Ganz gives us a complex, living, breathing human being -- which makes him all the more frightening.Bravo to everyone who had a hand in producing this masterpiece!",10,4,9,28 March 2005
