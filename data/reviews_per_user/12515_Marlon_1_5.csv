Iron Man 3," Iron man 3: A Disappointment.
","Iron man 1: Great movieIron man 2: Great movieI couldn't wait for the sequel.but after seeing Iron man 3, it felt like a huge disaster. If they where going to end the series, they shouldve done it at Iron man.The first2/3 of the movie was exciting, after that it became a generic super-hero movie, the enemies were too easy defeat and there wasn't any depth into their backgrounds.It did not feel like RBJ was at risk here, his 'anxiety attacks' seemed to be the only problem, and beside that it was a walk in the park for him.They didn't make him seem vincible and that added greatly to the decrease in tension.5/10. Could've done better.",5,0,3,27 August 2013
Fight Club," Fight Club - Where is my soap?
","It's a great movie, I cannot doubt that. But it has it flaws, flaws that could've been avoided if about 45 minutes would've been spend on research about certain aspects, Such as that guys 'Illness' he gets, they shouldve made it more realistic and certainly tie up the lose ends so it would make all sense in the end, they did that in the end..but not enough.Nonetheless, It's a great a movie and I've been on the edge on my chair since the beginning, my jaw has dropped to the ground several times in Pu e amazement, I certainly recommend watching this without any pauses, because your life WILL be affected!I've certainly learned not to judge a film by it's genre, because this isn't what i thought it would be, i've sat there the entire time glued to the screen hoping to uncover all the mysteries.Even if Mystery or Sport is not your genre, go watch this. Fight sport isn't my genre at all, and i would've regretted this decision if i never watched 'Fight Club'I doubted at first.But after 15 minutes into the movie i was sold.It doesn't matter what you like, go watch this movie right now.It'll be worth it.1999, Why did you keep this gem from the public?Dirge.",7,0,1,27 August 2013
The Pianist," The Dark side of Humanity
","This is the dark side of Humanity, You'll see the death when the life is gone.All hope slowly disappears. But what if you did not know such painful truth?You'll be constantly hoping for better times, sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't.You'll never know for sure, this movie will drag you down into utter despair, anger, fear, and anxiety.But i can promise you, You'll feel the the same emotions he, Wladyslaw Szpilman, wouldve felt, and it's intense, saddening, and a sad reminder to some of our past, but also: Thrilling.The acting is superb and i can only give the decor a 10/10 because it was so realistic looking.Be prepared.",9,0,0,27 August 2013
Inception," Inception Captious
","Did this movie stir many minds?Yes it did.Have i or you watched it twice? I did, did you?The ending is so beautiful yet so incomplete.It makes us all wonder, what are our dreams? How do i know i am dreaming? Why do i keep forgetting my dreams?Even though Inception did not provide answers to these questions, it did provide insight, saddenly not many of us use it.After reading the next sentence see if you can answer the next question, to see if you know the question they intended to bring.Question below here (Dont read further until you think you know the answer). . . . . . . . . . . . . Is this Reality we're living in real? If it is, how do we know it is not a dream or a simulation?(We can feel pain and distress in dreams, We can shape up anything in our dream, so why aren't we doing that now?) . . That's the question they want us to think and philosophy about 'Is this a dream?",9,0,1,27 August 2013
Slumdog Millionaire," Children abuse horror
","Such a sad reality, even though the government over there said they have solved the problem, it is still going.I see this movie as a wake-up call, i hope someone wake's up.Because i cannot sleep with this.After watching this movie i did my research.All of it was shockingly true.The Government there said they stopped it; It still goes on today.Im lucky I'm born in Europe.Humanity? What's that?The most shocking is that some of them where children from the dumps, some ended up well, most did not.",8,0,2,27 August 2013
