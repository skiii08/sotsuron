50 First Dates," Entertaining but not Excellent
","I have to say first of all that Drew Barrymore is my favourite actress, she is not only very very pretty, but extremely charismatic and talented. And her wonderful essence shined through as always in this film. I also adore Adam Sandler- he is very very funny and charmingly silly and all his great characteristics donned the screen. However, this movie was a bit of a disappointment for me. I do admit that it was entertaining and the story line kept my interest from beginning to end, but if it wasn't for the two amazing stars in it -Barrymore & Sandler- this movie would've totally sucked. I guess I was offended by the way the story made fun of amnesia and short-term memory loss. I kept thinking throughout the whole movie that if someone really had this disorder, it would be completely and utterly awful! I know that comedy is meant to make light of certain negative things and I did laugh often, but I would immediately feel guilty... so I constantly had mixed feelings about everything that was going on in the film. The setting is in Hawaii and therefore the movie brings you to a warm and welcoming place. There is also a great collection of '80's & '70's songs scattered throughout the film that is also very comforting and nice to hear. There are many good qualities about this flick, but if you are very sensitive like I am, the issue of making fun of a mental disorder/physical disability may offend you- so be prepared. However if you can look past that, you can find yourself having a good time.",6,5,12,13 February 2005
The Evil Dead," This is the most over-rated Stupid movie ever!
","Yes, I know it was done on a low budget. But I still hate it! I think it is a lame excuse to brutally and violently bash women around. I don't remember seeing any male demons or any of the men getting thrown around and having their heads bashed open... no... not at all... for some reason only the women turn into these crazed lunatic demons and in turn are disgustingly and violently beaten to death by the non-possessed male characters. I am not a femme-Nazi, nor am I sensitive to violence and gore... but when it is so obvious that this movie was just an excuse to lash out in such an extremely negative way towards women and try to disguise it as a horror movie... I just had to say something. I've always thought that this movie was over-rated. I've seen a lot better independent films that were made with even lesser budgets than this one... who were able to created a lot better than this trash. Whose ever idea it was to have only female demons killed in this manner- shame on you! You suck!",1,25,56,14 February 2005
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Oldman is the Best Dracula Ever!
","This is the best rendition of Dracula ever captured on film. Gary Oldman's dark and sensual personae outshines any other vampire who ever dare put on a cape. To me Gary Oldman is the most talented and underrated actor ever. He becomes who he is playing, however in this role... Dracula became him... Oldman set the bar so high it is untouchable even to Bela Lugosi. Winona Ryder's delicateness suited the role of Mina/Elisabeta nicely and Keanu Reeves played the unsuspecting and naive Jonathan with satisfaction. However the whole movie comes together because of Gary Oldman's intoxicating essence. He draws the viewers into his darkness and passion and guides them through until the end. This film is drastically romantic and hauntingly captivating- just like a real Dracula movie should be. The cinematography deserved Oldman's phenomenal performance and perfectly created a true vampire realm. Francis Ford Coppola is brilliant. This is the spirit of the vampire.",10,362,482,14 February 2005
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Favourite Vampire Movie!
","I am a vampire lover and this is the ultimate vampire movie (second only to 'Bram Stoker's Dracula') consisting of the two sexiest male vampires ever created- Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. I must admit at first I thought Tom Cruise was a touch too 'apple pie' for this role, but he ultimately knocked my socks off! In fact, he is my second favourite vampire ever, second only to the incredible Gary Oldman in 'Bram Stoker's Dracula'. And Brad Pitt - oooh Brad Pitt - is hands down the most gorgeous vampire ever. And he played the role of Louis convincingly... but in my eyes would've suited the role of Lestat as well. If you love vampire movies, violence and gore, with a touch of romance and sadness then you will also love this film.",10,97,158,13 February 2005
The Wedding Singer," Funny Singer!
","This quirky film has everything- lots and lots of comedy, a nice touch of romance, some violence and a hint of sadness now and again. Oh and it also stars 2 of the most charming actors- Drew Barrymore, as Julia and Adam Sandler, as Robbie. Their on-screen chemistry is very remarkable to watch and their individual charm is most appealing. The movie is set in the 80's and is a great nostalgic piece for that time period- in all is cheesiness and glory! Sandler as the Wedding Singer will surprise you with his musical talents. And musicians who have run the gamut of various music-related jobs will have extra giggles. And of course Barrymore will dazzle you with her cuteness and poise. This movie will leave you in stitches! And a must see!!!",10,19,25,4 August 2005
