Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A Fitting End
","Remaining true to the tone and style of this new trilogy, the story comes to a conclusion very well.DON'T listen to the angry 'fans.' They await perfection and at the slightest sign of imperfection they explode in anger and dissatisfaction.Go see this film, fans and non-fans, alike will laugh, cry, and hang on the edge of their seat. Fans of the originals will leave feeling satisfied, as there is plenty of fan-service.The movie ends with some questions unanswered, however, leaving some wanting more.",8,2,5,21 December 2019
