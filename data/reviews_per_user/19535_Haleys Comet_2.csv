The Blair Witch Project," Save this one for video/DVD to watch during your Halloween party.
","The good, the bad and The Blair Witch... The fact that I saw Blair in a small theater did not help my perception that it really belonged somewhere in the realm of a college film production class and the annual showing of The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  Yes, I realize that the rawness is part of the reason so many thought that it was an incredible experience.  I can not begin to agree.The good: incredible acting on the part of all of the characters in this film, especially Heather Donahue as herself.  They truly convince me that this was film from an amateur's escapade (unfortunately part of the bad.)  I could see their emotional decline and feel their hopelessness and frustration.  The bad: Almost all character development was diminished by the monotony of the plot (see bottom for generalization  WARNING:  POSSIBLE SPOILER).  I was at no time scared by anything in the film, and toward the end was wishing something, anything, would really happen.  The Blair Witch: Where is she?  Who is she?  What the h*ll is she doing? 
All in all, Blair seems like a reoccurring nightmare.  When it's over, you're really relieved and hope you don't have to go through it again.  The Blair Witch Project proves that you can have almost flawless acting, but if you don't have a direction, a plot or some sort of clarification, you can't have a truly great story.  I can't tell you that Blair Witch is the worst movie I have seen.  In fact it wasn't bad at all, but it definitely has a sense of not belonging in theaters and a lot of filler. Even for a film that lasted only 83 minutes, it seemed to be incredibly long.  Save this one for video/DVD to watch during your Halloween party.  * * ½  or 5 out of possible 10.
***WARNING  POSSIBLE SPOILER*** If you're reading this, you must want to save your hard earned money. Seriously this is the jist of the whole movie`Here we are, we know where we are.

Listen, there it was again!  Oh, yeah we're definitely lost.  OH GOD, RUN!!!!  We're still lost but we will find our way.  I hate you!!  We need each other!! What the h*ll are these things?! We're doomed, where gonna die in this place.  Where's Josh?  Where's Josh?!!  Oh look, something bloody wrapped up in some twigs!  Oh look a house!  I can hear Josh!

The Sixth Sense," Hollywood, this is what movie watchers want to see.
","The Sixth Sense takes an emotional trip into the world of a little boy full of fear and desperation.   Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), a renowned child psychologist sees a chance at redemption and validation in Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a quite, compassionate child that has symptoms uncannily similar to those of Dr. Crowe's previous failed patient. Sixth shows a very human foundation, pulling viewers through an emotional roller coaster of suspense, glimmers of hope, and a corkscrew of a plot twist at the end that will have you doing double takes.  Bruce Willis shows his talent by playing an unusually passive role and allowing focus to fall on Haley Osment's projection of despair.  Haley's brilliance seems to outshine his age and reach to the level of ability far beyond that of a stereotypical child actor.  Sixth doesn't fall into a specific genre, which only helps to increase its believability factor.  Because the camera puts there with Cole through his most personal experiences, you feel his suffering, and understand his despair.  Hollywood, this is what movie watchers want to see. No more mindless psychobabble, outrageously and unbelievably monotonous plot lines and stiff, corpse-like performances (no pun intended).  Let The Sixth Sense stand as a pinnacle for others in the movie industry to admire.Final Rating:Acting: * * * * *, Plot: * * * *, Dialogue: * * * *, Believability: * * * * *, Suspense Factor: * * *, Drama Factor: * * * * *27/30 = 4.5 stars or 9.0 out possible 10.Predictions for Oscar Nominations:Best Film - The Sixth Sense, Best Actor - Bruce Willis, Best Supporting Actor - Haley Joel Osment, Best Screenplay - M.
