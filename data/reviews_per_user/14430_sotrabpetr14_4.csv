It," The lack of tension and spookiness.
","I agree with the overwhelming majority of positive reviews. Whether the story, individual characters, that appear in the movie, soundtrack and visual effects. It was all perfect, but with one thing I do not agree. With someone, who calls this movie horror or even the best horror movie of the year. There is no tension and fear, I wasn't afraid for any moment at all, literally, every exaggerated scene was expected. At least for a person who has some experience with this kind of genre. I was disappointed, mainly because someone was expecting something from the movie and when his expectations are not provided, he cannot be satisfied.",6,0,1,1 January 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," The jewel of all the movies.
","An imaginative movie liked by most people, who have seen it. Mainly due to the elaboration of the whole work. The creators thought to literally everything, it is true that some facts were not quite true here, but it does not matter. It was all perfect and breathtaking for me. I did not expect, to be so excited. And maybe intelligently processed movies come up, so that would be pretty nice I would say.",10,2,2,30 December 2018
A Quiet Place," Breathtaking experience.
","Interesting and original ambiance, sympathetic characters and greatly graduating atmosphere from beginning to end. Although I miss the explanation of how it all happened and where these monsters came from, I like that a lot. Because of the fear of any sound, the viewer is literally attached to the screen and expects what happens next. Filmmaking is an insanely difficult process, and I admire the creators for how well they did.",8,1,2,2 January 2019
Ice Age: Continental Drift," It's still the same, but in this case, it's worse.
","In comparison with the first parts, that was somehow entertaining and original. I was much disappointed with this one. Sometimes there were funny moments, that's true, but the rest of the movie was embarrassing and uninteresting. It all seems to me like it is the rewind of one and the same disc over and over. In time, it gets tired.",4,1,1,29 December 2018
