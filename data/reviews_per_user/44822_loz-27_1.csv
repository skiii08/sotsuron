Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The funniest and most non-p.c. film of all time. Superb.
","This film will have you crying with laughter, cringing with disbelief and then crying with laughter again and again and again. I literally didn't stop laughing all the way through and I'm sure it will be a classic comedy of our time in years to come. A truly original and genius piece of work.Some will call say bits of this film are vile and call for it to be censored or banned etc, etc, ....but just ignore them, it wasn't aimed at them. If you are really easily offended and can't take a joke this film is probably best avoided but for everyone else who understands the superb ironic humour of Sacha Baron Cohen, this will be the funniest film you've seen in many years!!!!For those that have seen Sacha's very funny 'Ali G In Da House' film, this is a much more mature and better produced piece of work altogether.",10,5,18,10 October 2006
