It," Modern Horror, Not Enough Creepiness
","I was excited to watch this newer version of It, hoping that with a good cast and a great story to build upon, I would get a glimpse back into my childhood nostalgia of deep fear and a sense of being really, really scared...but boy was I wrong.While the cast was great, the main creepy of the movie was ruined by an exaggeration of scenes, mostly with jump scares, and Pennywise being almost a joke with all of his CGI effects. My expectations for Pennywise were to sink in a level of fear, instead I got a dose of modern film CGI. It almost felt like crossing a modern Transformers movie with the old version of It. The kids were great, everything else wasn't.The movie couldn't pull off the 'Horror' expectations and the film score didn't help much either. The score was really bad and exaggerated just like the so called scary scenes. The director and producers of this version would have done well to study older horror films to try and reproduce the sense of scare and fear vs the exaggerated scenes and jump scares it had.",4,0,1,23 November 2017
