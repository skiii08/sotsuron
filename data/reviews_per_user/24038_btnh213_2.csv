The Incredible Hulk," Incredible! No spoilers..
","I've seen my fair share of bad movies and big letdowns and this one is definitely not it. Despite their lower-than-ironman budget, they delivered and did a better job than Ironman. Unlike Ironman, it had a longer fighting scene and was not anti-climatic. I'm not exactly sure how a casual viewer would find this movie but as a fan, i gave it plenty of 'nods of approval'. They did change the story abit here and there, but i personally feel that the changes are for the better, and certainly better than Stan Lee's version.Also, if you're a big fan of Bruce Jones work on The Incredible Hulk comics, you'd love this. It's almost identical in atmosphere and style; which makes sense since the director studied Bruce Jones' work prior to making this movie.Unlike other movies, although there was some romance, it didn't ruin the movie at all (unlike the love triangle in X-men). Instead, this movie brought out great depth of character for both Bruce Banner and Betty Ross. Even the Hulk himself...The only possible flaw would be at the climax, where it didn't last as long as desired. The other flaw (only the fans would understand this) is that hulk's anger level seems to be at a 8/10. His 'sanity barrier' did not break, which was such a waste..Overall, i gave this movie a 9 out of 10. If the climax was fixed, it would easily be a legendary 9.5, up there with the Godfather.Enjoy Hulk fans!",9,1,6,12 June 2008
Iron Man," It was good, but not great (contains some spoilers)
","Iron Man starts with the playful Tony Stark; wealthy, cocky and one of immense reputation and power. After being kidnapped and forced to make weapons for terrorists, he sneakily builds his first prototype suit and blasts his way out of there.Then he has a change of heart and feels that only he has the responsibility to harness weapons and decides to be a superhero. So far so good.It all goes downhill once his colleague gets a hold of the secretive prototype suit and makes his own adjustments.As you might imagine, this should make for some juicy fight scenes. But unfortunately, it does not. The fighting scenes lacked excitement and was not creative at all. There was no sense of urgency and seemed like a spar instead of an actual fight.Humor is peppered throughout the movie and they weren't too bad. For the first 3/4 of the film, it seemed like it would be a really good movie. But the ending seemed rushed and incomplete. Robert Downey however, captured the essence of Tony Stark very well. The antagonist was simply too cheesy and clich√©. It was like just another issue of Ironman, instead of one to remember.",7,1,2,13 June 2008
