The Legend of Bagger Vance," Five stars despite itself
","Great acting, great direction, great cinematography... absolutely lame story. I found myself thinking about Charlize Theron's cool looking hats more than the plot. Nothing anyone could've done to make it an interesting movie. And I think the book was a best seller...go figure. I'll bet if I liked golf I'd have a different opinion.",5,3,5,9 November 2000
