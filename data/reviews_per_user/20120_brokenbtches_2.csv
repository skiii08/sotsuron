The Perks of Being a Wallflower," coolio
","I really liked this movie, i LOVE ezra miller, especially in this movie, and i think it deals with issues people are struggling with. it is a great movie, and a great story, the only thing why it hasnt got 10 stars is because i hate when the dad says 'your cruisin for a bruisin' because i think this is so CRINGE like i wanted to cry when i heard this, maybe it was because i was hit a lot when i was younger, maybe i just hate this sentence because it cringe. anyways, it is a blast. u should check it out.",9,0,0,30 March 2020
