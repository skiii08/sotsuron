Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," So it wasn't so good.. What did you expect??
","I just saw The Phantom Menace, and I'm gonna have to go with the flow: this movie wasn't so good..  It had potential, but blew it with lines such as 'Yahoo!' and... 'Yahoo!'  When this movie comes out on tape I think I'll re-record it, but with all of Anakin and Jar-Jar's lines Muted out, that just might change my mind about the movie.  Now anyhow, coming to my point: This movie sucked, What's the big surprise??  Didn't you people see the other Star Wars??  I know, I had 'fond' memories of them, too, but when I actually went back and WATCHED the old Star Wars movies, they weren't so great either.  The acting was just as bad in the old SW movies as in the new one.  The only thing I really liked about Episodes 4,5, & 6 was Harrison Ford.  Now, I would've said the same for Liam Neeson, but they already killed him off.  Who's left to support the next two Star Wars movies?? Now, I'll admit Empire Strikes Back was a good movie, but it was a 'mid-way' movie, with no real beginning or end.  And the two supporting links (A New Hope and Return of the Jedi) were weak. And one additional question for you to ponder:  How did George Lucas manage to make Yoda look even faker than in the original movies and how did he manage to create a race (Jar-jar & co) MORE annoying than the Ewoks:?? Now in conclusion, I'm not in any way saying 'Don't see this movie', but when you see it, let your opinions be heard, and maybe George Lucas will hire REAL writers for the next movies..",1,3,6,2 June 1999
Fight Club," Worst ending ever..
","Two great movies, in my opinion, are `The Game' and `Seven'-- Both directed by David Fincher.  So, obviously, I went into `Fight Club' wanting to love it.  And I did.  Well, the first half, anyway.  From there on, it went straight downhill into just another Hollywood-produced uncreative clone-movie.  I could go in and pin-point the exact frame where the film turns from an intriguing, smart drama into an unimaginitive hybrid of two of the worst movies that I've seen:  `The Matrix' and `Dark City'.All three of these movies seem to have a common  `new-age' theme.  They all convey the message, `The individual can do anything, and as long as they don 't seek aid  from an outside source, their power is limitless.'  Maybe these Anti-Establishment / Anti-Religion ideals are just a faze in modern media, but it could also be the direction the industry will be heading in the future.As for `Fight Club' on its own, Brad Pitt and Edward Norton play their parts well, and the movie does have some redeeming elements, but overall I can't recommend it.  But, don't let that dissuade you from seeing the movie-- I'd never say, `Don't see this movie'.  You should always see the movie to have an opinion of your own.  Just watch this one with your eyes open.",1,14,44,7 November 1999
