Skyfall," where has James bond gone?
","I just came back from watching the movie with my brother and i must say that we were both very disappointed with it. Although i am pleased to say that this is not the worst of them. i need to declare that for me this movie was the last nail in the bond Coffin. I think that putting Daniel Craig in bonds shoes Symbolizes the downhill slope that the movies were going to take from that moment on. The James bond we all grew to love and admire, the one who used his wits and charms before going for his fists or guns is gone,and all is left is just a thug with a gun and no charm at all. All the suspense is now completely gone from the movies and in every plot you just know his going to go for his gun or kick someone when he runs out of ammo. Where is the mystery the swagger the old bond which i grew up wanting to be,charming the ladies and his enemies with a smile and some Witty line, not just a hail of Bullets and blood up to his ears. sorry, i won't be seeing any more bond movies because clearly the magic is gone, it's just a plain bad old action movie with good stunts and effects, marvelous scenery and nothing more.",6,4,12,8 November 2012
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," B rated version
","Just went to seem the movie with high expectation and let me just say how disappointed i was. Peter Jackson who i dearly admire and love, took a 15 minute bit out of the book and made it into a two hour film which you could sleep through and awaken from time to time just to see the special effects. The movie in this part continues by the book as we join our merry companions on there way to the lonely mountain, but from there about 90% is just made up and has no connection to the book what so ever,what are all the extra characters for? why do we need more plot lines that amount to nothing at the end? let me add that the 'HOBBIT' as you know is a children book and has many parables about: Friendship,camaraderie, being brave, being possessive, good and bad and so on, but it pains me to see how all of this impotent parables are quickly cast aside just to make time for more special effects, whats the point of the story if not for that. I was very disappointed and i think that its a shame because the first one was so lovely and this one really ruined it for me",7,3,10,14 December 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," What a great experience
","Just saw the movie yesterday in 3D and i think it was AMAZING, me and my brother set for the full 170 min and the only thing that i was sorry about was the 5 minute break that interrupted the flow of the movie. First of all let me say that i came as everybody did, with the expectation to see a great movie but an overstretched one that might spoil my fun. but to my and my brothers amazement it was a great movie, when the break came after half the movie was gone i thought that only 10 min have passed,the movie was so reverting and exciting i HAVE to say that i felt like there were no dead moments every thing was just like i hoped, and they even managed to spice it up with a lot of hummer and fun. All the actress do a Great job of acting and from the first moment you fill like you're being socked up into the plot, like being the 15 member of the gang. I must say that peter Jackson embellished some parts and added all kinds of scenes that aren't even in the book, but every thing looks welcomed and adds the appropriate tension and excitement to the plot. Most of all i must say the 3D effects look amazing, its even better then avatar. everything has a great depth to it and the computer graphics just overwhelms you at every corner of the movie. Its a must see movie. better then the lord of the rings and i know i'll go to see it again.",9,7,16,16 December 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," BAD BAD version of twilight
","Hi Just went yesterday to see the new spider man movie and let me just say it is really not amazing. The dialogs are boring and it feels that they are taken from a very bad intimation of twilight. the Two main Characters Emma Stone is a great actress but it seems that since the start of this movies her acting level has really gone down and that is coming from a fan.Her partner in life and crime which is this movie Andrew Garfield who is our hero should really take some acting classes because he is single handedly destroying spider man's charter for everyone, why doe's his spider man charter always cries but always, Tobias Maguire spider man never cried what's with the sissy attitude,the amazing spider man is the crying spider man and he needs some spine and fast, not against his enemy's but against the lady in his life. with out the special effect's and Jammie fox and sealy field to save this movie, all of us at the theater would have walked out and demanded our money back. I hope the studious will save face and stop this remaking of spider man because if a third installment goes out, there will be no hope for our friendly spider at all.",5,7,15,9 May 2014
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," loved It
","really loved the movie everything really takes you in to the atmosphere of the times the agony of lost of friends, the 'romance' between the main characters. The arena in which the plot takes place,amazing work with all the special effects. Love Jennifer Lawrence looks amazing and great acting, woody harlson really nails his character. They play there characters exactly as i imagined them to be. Of course All the major key components of the book are not shown here, and again content fly's through the window for more 'Reality' time (the pledges killing each other), it seems that everybody forget that this is a love story not an action movie, but hey what ever works. Loved it go see it",8,1,16,14 December 2013
