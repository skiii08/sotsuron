Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Better when you see both
","Possible spoilers.The Kill Bills really need to be watched one after the other for the best effect. I saw #1 a while back and was less favorable to it than after seeing them together.I knew there were tributes to Asian martial arts movies in #1, but I'm not a big follower of those, so it wasn't until I saw #2 that I realized that there must have been quite a lot of references, because #2 is filled with Western tributes, mostly Spaghetti Western tributes. #2 has Leone written all over it, with even a dash of Peckinpah and Eastwood in the way scenes are staged, and you can hear Morricone's haunting epic music a mile away. I love catching on to references like that and Tarantino has gotten real good at it. #2 is probably the better half. There's much more dialog, the sort of dialog that Tarantino does so well. and enough action to keep things going, including another Battle of the Bad*ss *itches with Thurman vs. Hannah, as well as a claustrophobic segment that I didn't know about that also worked as a good tie-in to Uma's martial arts training. #1 has some classic scenes besides just fights, though, that entertained me. The whole big scene leading up to the Crazy 88s battle has all kinds of things going on that you don't see the 1st time. 9/10 for both when seen together.Both DVDs have extras, but #2 has the best with a Making Of and some premiere night music. I'm tempted to buy a movie just because it has a DTS soundtrack so the fact that both of these do is icing on the cake. Thus the DVDs also get a 9/10 but perhaps a bit weaker 9. You can see a combined Ultimate Special Edition coming with this duo as there must be more stuff they're holding back on, milking the DVD buyers with multiple releases I'm happy with these so it would have to be really something to tempt me.I read some of the comments so-called professional critics made panning these movies. They just don't get it. Most of the discouraging words are about the blood and guts, but I thought segments like the Crazy 88s were cartoonish, just like the wirework in that segment, and was deliberate overkill to keep it from looking real. How can you take those blood sprays seriously? At least I think thats what Tarantino was up to, but I didn't ask him. Maybe he just likes to gross out wimpy movie critics. I mean so what if Lucy Liu gets a real deep buzzcut Some dissed him for lifting characters from old movies which is really a dumb*ss comment since he did it on purpose.",9,0,1,14 November 2004
Training Day," Great start, stretches for an end
","There are spoilers/plot clues in this review.The good things about this movie are: Great/good acting from all the major characters. Excellent first hour. Its really LA on the film; some of the bit actors are claimed to be actual gang members, and I cringed imagining myself having to navigate through such hostile territory.The parts that aren't so good are: Crooked cops would not try to set up a first-day-in-narcotics rookie. It would smell bad to everyone. A loose cannon like the Washington character would not have made it for 13 years on the force. The ending was predictable but they should've at least given it a little more time playing up to it. The short story is that the plot gets more and more out there as the movie goes on. By the end of the movie I didn't believe it anymore.",7,0,11,18 November 2002
Elizabeth," A great looking film, an excellent lead, but history?
","I watched this movie on DVD. The costuming and other period work are great. Cate Blanchett's performance is spectacular. It is a truly enjoyable film to watch. Just don't expect to learn any real history from it. Many of the historical characters have been altered in their relative ages and arrival on the scene. Walsingham was not around in her early reign, Cecil was in his thirties at the time of coronation and counseled Elizabeth for most of her reign. If she had gotten pregnant by Dudley in her early reign, when she had very little support, do you think she would have survived? Would she be so foolish to risk it? There was never any 'Godfather' quality to her reign, where on a given day numerous enemies were executed Don Corleone style. That is ridiculous. The Scottish French queen resembles her historical figure in name only. On the other hand, the film captures the brutal power-grabbing nature of European politics of the day, the degenerate state of religion. Her early years were treacherous and she almost lost her head. Her rise to power and real control surprised the hell out of a lot of people. Since that is the focus of the movie I can buy off the revisionist stuff and enjoy the movie!",8,0,0,6 March 2000
The Terminator," One of the great Sci Fi movies
","The first time I saw this was on VHS and my eyes were riveted to the screen from the opening scene to the end credits. Some of the best films I've ever seen have been directed by unproven newbies on small budgets but with big ideas. This was John Cameron's big idea and of course the whole movie production was tense and always pressed for money, but the end result was one the best ever Sci Fi movies. 20 years later and its still fun to watch. I still say 'I'll be back' sometimes in my deepest voice when I'm leaving the office.Today I just saw it in glorious commercial-free HD from HDNet. It looked exquisite of course but I've been reading about remastering, compression and digitizing movies so I always wonder just what it is I'm seeing. Was it a digital transfer like the new Star Wars remasters? Probably not. It looked pretty good but I'm betting that Dish does some compression on HD signals, especially when they're on the Basic HD package list like HDNet is. Even so, it'd be hard to watch that smeary old VHS Terminator tape after seeing Ahnuld etal in High Definition!",10,0,1,2 November 2004
We Were Soldiers," Sure looks right to me
","Many Viet vets laud this film for an accurate portrayal of what fighting in Vietnam was like. It also shows the impact that the war had on the wives waiting back home. The movie had an emotional impact on me which was unexpected; in that way it is the rare war movie that shows both sides; the Vietnamese were/are just people, with the same fears and motivations that we have. I remember the shoddy reception that the typical soldier got returning home from this awful war. It had become so politicized that very little appreciation was shown to them. Whether the war is just or not, soldiers that fight it bleed and die, supposedly for their country. The battle screenplay, effects and intensity are among the best I've seen. You'll be glued to the screen during the last half, so take your break and get whatever you need to watch it without interruption. Its' worth it.",9,8,14,8 February 2003
Fargo," Ya, you must watch this movie
","I realize that there's a bunch of nasty things happening on the screen and there are a couple of scenes that were chilling/sad, but I just couldn't help but laugh at some of the gawky exchanges that took place between some of the characters. I began watching this movie with some uneasiness as a friend expressed revulsion over it. That friend must've been in a funk to derate this flick. Despite the content and the overlay of a peculiar accent that I didn't even know existed, this is a good movie. It would be a good movie without the language accent, but it wouldn't be as funny. The actors could take their characters on the road and make a good living.",9,0,0,13 December 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The Platinum DVD version
","I originally commented on the theatrical release and original DVD. This is an update to those comments. The Platinum DVD is the version to own, period. It does not fix a couple of things that bothered me about the original version. One added scene has a color palette so different that it should've been left out if not correctable. But, but this version fleshes out the characters and the story in a pleasing way that I can give it a 10 without hesitation. I guess it was just too long for the theaters.",10,1,1,25 November 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Great adaptation of epic!
","I gave this movie a 9 on the IMDB survey. That's excellent, since hardly any movies are rated by me that high and 10s are a scant few. I first saw this movie in a theater and was ready for the Two Towers right then! I was entranced. Also I hadn't read the trilogy in about 25 years. I read the Fellowship right before watching the DVD this time and of course saw the compromises made to get the movie down to about 3 hours. Personally I'd be happy to see a 6 hour Fellowship movie since it would've certainly been more intelligent. How can you 2nd guess which parts to cut/edit/shorten? For me the whole story was more than just parts. Gandalf was always going to go with Frodo when he left the Shire and sure as hell would not have rode off to get advice, leaving him on the road with just Sam. The fact that the journey started out 17 years after the party, and not a few days later, when Frodo was about 50 gives the impression that the Hobbits are just big kids. The Tom Bombadill episode wasn't essential, but it is the first instance of getting help along the way, a running thread throughout the trilogy. It also showed that not all things were swayed by the power of the Ring. I suppose it is nice to have Arwen rescue Frodo from the Nazgul (it was great on camera) but Glorfindel did just fine in the book, and Frodo was alone on the horse at the river which I think makes him a stronger character. As movies can only do, you notice that the fellowship was on foot and I just don't get why Tolkien didn't give them horses to ride once the Fellowship set off from Rivendell. Who the heck would want to walk? Things unseen and unspoken go on in the Lothlorien that would've added to the magical nature of the quest. Mostly though, it is the shortening of the story that grates, because what is shown is a work of art and an act of love. Starting at Bilbo's party and right down to the breaking of the fellowship I felt taken in and in awe that the movie could capture the spirit of the book so well, if not the letter. The Balrog is a great DVD replay item! I'm no Tolkien fanboy with bookmarks on every page but this is the grandaddy of all modern fantasy stories and a great movie was finally made to do it justice.",10,1,1,18 August 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," I thought it would stink but it doesn't
","Possible spoilersAfter all the negative comments about Revolutions, I didn't have much hope for it when I popped the DVD in the player. I was pleasantly surprised.Most people don't understand what's going on in the Matrix movies. They liked the dynamics, 'bullet time' slomo and cool style of the first one, more or less grounded in our world, then were disappointed greatly by Reloaded, and ignored Revolutions in droves.I didn't like Reloaded much either, but thats another movie. Revolutions, on the other hand, is more my cup of java. They had a difficult casting problem with the death of the Oracle (Gloria Foster), and they managed an adequate 'patch' to their program. The Matrix is quite a bit like a computer program all the way through. In Revolutions, the final battle pits Neo against Smith (again) in the ultimate superhero-style battle. Any comic book fan should enjoy the fight sequence between them, but most people miss that that particular Agent Smith was really the Smith/Oracle, who at the critical moment does an interrupt of Smith's program and gives Neo the way in, so that main computer can delete the Agent Smith program (at the end of the fight in the crater). That is why Neo had to go to the machine city, so he could get plugged into the matrix at its mainframe core, or bus as it were, so the mainframe would get hooked directly into Agent Smith. Some of that stuff reminds me of the old movie Tron.I'm a pretty crappy Mech game player but I really like the whole Mech thing, so the huge Siege battle with the Mech 'APU's lined up and fighting the losing fight against the hordes of Sentinels warmed my Target Lock and HUD display. A truly awesome display of combining multiple technologies to get something believable and lots of it on the screen.I don't quite get the meaning of the 'Den of BDSM' and why the Merovingian hangs out there, unless the old file server just likes all his porn and it was an excuse to get Bellucci in a revealing red leather/latex outfit, and local BDSM shops had sales that week so it was an economical thing to do. Or it could be that being French says it all about the Merovingian and that was really decadent digital hell, as the mythical Persephone/Bellucci would indeed spend half her time there. Her only line was on perceiving Trinity's love for Neo, and thus underlined her own deal with the devil.Of course there's lots of wirework in this movie. All the actors clearly worked hard, as it is a very physical movie. The acting is so-so. Hugo Weaving aka Elrond as Agent Smith is my favorite. The Matrix trilogy is deeper than most give it credit for.The DVD presents the movie very well. You can see the actors pits, pores and goobles in great detail, and the audio works out all the speakers. There's a Making Of that I would've liked a lot more if the crew didn't spend so much time pimping their work. The DVD gets a high 8/10",9,0,1,14 November 2004
The Patriot," Mel's played this role before, but its good anyway
","I haven't read any other IMDB reviews on The Patriot, but there's probably references to Braveheart and Last of the Mohicans. It's not quite up to the level of either of those films, but that just means it is merely very good. A couple of the film ideas look like direct lifts from Last of the Mohicans, and Mel Gibson as Benjamin Martin is only slightly less bent on vengeance than William Wallace, while still greatly desiring to kick British butt. I also thought a couple of the combat sequences were too contrived, like big time wrestling and very formula. Still this film has is moments that make it worth watching, and it is beautifully filmed. If the greens were any greener it would be on another planet. The battle scene sound effects play well on a surround system. The acting is generally solid and the film pacing only threatens to flitter away the emotional involvement a time or two, so from beginning to end a film watcher with just a little tolerance will be engaged.",8,0,1,9 November 2003
Resident Evil," It's got a beat you can dance to
","The soundtrack is the most attractive element of the movie. It fits the screenplay very well. Jovovich is easy on the eyes and she has an expressive face that keeps you interested in her. The rest of the cast is fair to good; no crummy acting at least. Some settings are appropriately creepy. It does run down into a 'kill all zombies' movie, the plot could've used a few more minutes developing the mostly fictional science, and there were some lack of continuity in the scene transitions. Still Resident Evil worth watching if you don't mind blood and guts. I learned, for instance, never to stick my head out of a stuck elevator. I'd give it a 7.5 here at IMDb if I could but I can't quite go to an 8 so it is a 7/10.",7,0,0,31 August 2003
Blue Crush," Hi marks for the audio presentation
","I won't dispute the weakness in the story and some so-so acting. In this particular case I rate this movie highly for its video and especially audio quality. For any home theater fanatic looking for top notch sound this is one of the best. When they're out in the water laying pipe, etc... its about as good a sound track as I've heard. You can almost feel the water getting in your ears. The video isn't far behind but that was easier for the filmmakers since the Hawaiian coast is so beautiful. I found the story to be passable, but there are a couple of segments that are dumb and I skip over on repeat viewings. Some of the extra features on the DVD are also good. If you have a good HT audio setup this needs to be in your collection!",8,18,28,12 July 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," No Entmoot needed to love this film!
","Now that 2 of the 3 movies have been released, it is clear that the movie-going public is witnessing a unique addition to the art. Years from now, when the LOTR cast and crew are old or gone, these films will still be on any movie lover's short list. There are old favorites now, single films or a series, but I cannot think of any that I would mention in the same sentence. If the various awards' groups don't come up with some special honors for these movies then they don't know jack about their own art or what pleases the public.Anyone who nitpicked the first movie about wandering from Tolkien's story will have even more to chew on this time. It all made sense in the end, though it was sometimes diquieting. There's also a couple of additions to the movie that you won't find in the books, all to the good. The pacing is frenetic, with 3 storylines going on at once. They could be called The Three Musketeers, Lost in the Wilderness, and the Magic Forest. There's much more action in the Two Towers, with the battle at Helm's Deep an awe-inspiring spectacle that must last about 30 minutes. I don't think I've ever seen anything like the Ents' assault on Isengard! The film-makers did such a good job with Gollum that he is possibly the most engaging character in the film, his twisted mind notwithstanding. I can't wait to see the DVD extended version!!",10,0,0,25 December 2002
Schindler's List," You must see it at least once
","It gets a rare 10/10 from me although it is not on my Top 10 List, mostly because it isn't a movie that anyone really enjoys watching as much as one that needs to be watched. In any case I sure can't be in a laid back mindset ready to watch an action flick and substitute Schindler's List at the last second; I gotta be ready for it.I've watched it 3-4 times, the first time in a theater with my sister who was dying of cancer and wanted to see it. I remember one of her sons theorized that the Holocaust never happened and it was a way to justify the destruction of the Nazi regime, or some other BS, that I've heard variations of before. They just don't have any grounding in history. Even the Nazis who were hung for it didn't deny it; they were just following orders.Its quite a movie with all the talent both on and off the screen doing some of their best work ever. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes really should've won Oscars, but it won so many others I suppose they wanted to spread them around a little.The fairly recently released DVD package is a bit of a throwback with an odd case and a single double-sided DVD. If there's some special reason for it I don't know what it is. It has a DTS soundtrack but the B&W video was quite harsh on my screen with very bright interior lighting sometimes bombing details to smithereens. I had to adjust my screen to watch it. I don't recall that on the old laserdisc or anywhere else. It gets quite a bit lower 7/10 rating.",10,9,13,12 October 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," This should be aka Buckets of Blood, Part 1
","There could be something here that amounts to a SPOILER, but there's not much mystery about or in Kill Bill to spoil.Somebody in special effects decided that humans have enough blood and pressure to spray like a broken fire hydrant if a body part gets hacked off. It is so unreal it is in a way less disturbing than a realistic depiction. The best example is the accountant that loses an arm; if you think about what ensues, she lost enough blood for 10 people.The massive sword fights make it clear that the heroine is invincible, executing perfect multiple dismemberments, leaps and bounds that Peter Pan would be proud of while barely breaking a sweat. Except for just a few of the top evildoers, armies of swordspeople have no chance against her. There must've been some Criminals Only Get Swords rule in effect because hardly any guns were used at all.The best fights are the one-on-one duels. Kill Bill starts off with a kickass fight sequence that would be the grand finale for lesser movies.The fights are the only reason to watch Kill Bill. There was one scene though that reminded me of 'Samurai Submarine Sandwich Shop' or whatever that comedy skit was called. They didn't quite go through with chopping up the food with a sword, but I thought they might and it would've been hilarious. Tarentino has such a sick sense of humor it probably wouldn't have fit in, but if you can get past the bloodsprays there's more ultradark comedy here than it may first appear.I gave Kill Bill an 8/10, or 87%, a brick or two shy of excellent, but it might go up if Kill Bill 2 delivers.",8,0,2,10 May 2004
Toy Story," It's a Happy Movie! Ya there's spoilers
","I put this computer animated movie just on the cusp of being great. You can ignore the breakthrough aspect of the graphics and it remains a fun story with some very witty dialog. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen do great voice work as the lead toys, with Cowboy Bob's jealousy of new toy Buzz Lightyear providing the fuel for most of the story. They're both hilarious as Bob plays the brains, and hatches schemes for this and that, including spooking the evil kid next door who tortures and blows up toys for fun. Buzz is mostly on the job thinking he really is a Space Ranger, loses his self identity when he finds out he is just a toy, winding up as a tea time doll for a little girl. In the end, though, they come together and save the day and themselves just in time...8.7/10 This DVD is part of the Toy Story 2 Pack, but I believe the actual movie transfers are the same in all the retail packages. Quality animation always looks good on the big screen and this looks wonderful. This is a Buy and Hold to flesh out your collection to include 'Happy Movies' as my daughter puts it. The DVD is a solid 9/10",9,0,0,20 August 2004
Once Upon a Time in America," Good but not great
","I wanted to like this movie. I love some of Sergio Leone's other movies and kind of expected to enjoy this, his last movie, at least as much. For some reason I had never seen more than clips of it.  Leone's movies always have great atmosphere and interesting minor characters. It was a treat to see Jennifer Connelly in her 1st role, and of course it had to be her eyes that got her the part, since Leone tells at least part of his stories with the eyes. This brings up the movie's weakness, the story. I didn't think it was a compelling story, not one to spend 3+ hours on. There weren't many tense moments, unsympathetic main characters that all deserved to die if only for not cracking any good jokes or one liners, and there was none of the sweeping scope that you might expect from a Leone movie. The end was a muddy puddle that didn't make a lot of sense. I'm glad I watched this highly regarded movie, but I doubt that I will again.",8,5,11,18 April 2004
Stalingrad," Russia 1,400,000, Germany 600,000
","That's roughly the fatality score in the nastiest battle of WWII. Russia won and cracked the Wehrmacht in more ways than one at this turning point. Russia always had a higher body count, at least until near war's end, because they used their infantry as cannon fodder, and civilians added to the count. Russia could keep throwing bodies at the Germans, but the Germans couldn't sustain such a loss as the Russians finally pulled off a pincer movement of their own.Although the battle includes entire armies, it is small unit action that is on the screen. Platoons and companies, sometimes a battalion. Except for a few recurring characters, largely anonymous actors come and go on the screen. This has been criticized but that is what large scale war is; an anonymous action of brutal firepower where combatants are routinely blown up, ripped apart and smashed. Survivors keep their sanity by a crude apathy about their fate, only occasionally breaking down when a foxhole buddy, a long-lived survivor finally gets eliminated. Such a loss is hard for them to take.Stalingrad is not the goriest war movie I've ever seen but there's enough. The segment through the sewers was more disturbing for me to watch. Gah! I also think the horrible winter conditions were done well. All in all I'm very glad I've never had to suffer all the extreme hardships almost everyone there had to.Almost everyone except the elite, of course. The movie just dances around that fact a bit, but the truth is even under the worst conditions the leadership managed to keep themselves relatively well cared for. General Paulus did not have to walk to Siberia; he became a showpiece for Stalin, and to his dying day cursed Hitler for not allowing him to retreat and save his men. Its a big What-if in history as how that might have changed the course of the war. As it was, only about 6,000 of the German POWs made it back alive after the war from this battle.The movie has a detached feel to it which I think is deliberate, to give the sense of what war is like. But as a result, you don't feel engaged with the actors on the screen. I don't think Stalingrad has a high replay value. You get a taste of what such a bitter battle might be like, but who wants such a bitter experience more than once? It's a good movie to see once.The DVD has both original German and English dub audio. I watched the subtitles because I wanted to hear the actors on the screen even if I didn't know what they actually all said. My subwoofer was silent and if anything came out of the surrounds I didn't notice. Almost no extras. The DVD is 7/10",8,0,0,6 September 2004
The Red Violin," Engrossing story, good acting
","I enjoyed this movie a lot. The lives of the people that used or were associated with the violin were fascinating, along with its near destruction on more than one occasion. Acting was solid all through. I thought the very end was an unnecessary twist that didn't really make a lot of sense. They could've figured out something better. But all in all a good show, worth watching again sometime.",9,0,0,13 August 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," No one said it had to make sense...
","Reloaded is more fun than its given credit for. In fact, I just about busted out laughing a couple of times. For one thing, the dancing scene was so off the wall it was funny. BTW, why is it that men always have hairless chests in movies these days? Is that some kind of rule now? The dialog was so full of technobabble I wondered if refugees from Star Trek had infiltrated the screenwriters. All you can do is chuckle at some of that stuff.Once you get past those things, and the fact that the actors spent more time on floating on wires than any other 10 movies, its not so bad, even fun. The action sequences play out well, good music, and the movie has a great style, even allowing for the carefully dirtied clothes that they wore in between the forays onto the surface. They had some very cool sunglasses. Monica Bellucci makes any movie worth watching, even if she's in Reloaded for only a few minutes.Watch this movie just for fun and style statements and its not bad at all. If you try to take it too seriously you'll be disappointed. 8/10.",8,0,0,6 March 2004
The Silence of the Lambs," Sure its psychological, but is that a good thing?
","A possible spoiler in the text.I'm more skeptical of this movie than some, although I do give an 8/10. Its sequel Hannibal reveals what interested Hollywood to begin with; a story about profoundly disturbed mind(s) that was a vehicle to unload nasty psycho segments onto a public thats been so desensitized it takes just that kind of imagery to get a horrified response. There's nothing new about that, and depending on the content I'm sometimes a willing victim. I'll give SotL credit for good acting and a good mystery that needs a solution, but they lost me when Claire most unprofessionally blunders into Bill's lair with no backup. Its a totally rookie move made to appear necessary by the fiction of the story. The peculiar relationship between Lechter and Starling is the most interesting part of the movie.",8,0,0,1 December 2004
Ben-Hur," Still good after 40+ years, but made for a different audience.
","Ben Hur, a Tale of the Christ, was hugely popular as a novel, a play and two movies. It was written in a less vulgar time about a very spiritual event. Seen today by moviegoers addicted to constant action and low frequency effects, it will seem ponderous, slow and pretentious. Well, it is a little. You have to pay attention to the dialogue or you won't get it at all. Some of the intimate scenes aren't all that great. Anyone that really pays attention can tell the sea battle is done with miniatures. It's still worth watching. As everyone ought to know by now, the chariot race is one-of-a-kind; nothing else comes close to that real live race where the main actors actually raced  most of the time. I just watched this movie after lapse of about 10 years. I still enjoyed it. The sea battle is still fun even if you know the boats are about as big as a man. The few moments which have Christ on the screen are still moving. Just about all of the acting is good with only a few forgettable moments. Just be ready to spend about 4 hours in front of the screen listening to occasionally flowery dialog.",9,130,252,4 September 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," They could make one a year ad infinitum
","I had trouble with ROTK in the theatrical release, and once again the DVD Extended Edition soothes my irritation with additional footage. In this case about 50 minutes of added footage, so you're looking at 250 minute commitment of time just for the movie, and if you want to see significant chunks of the extras, you'd better call in sick or forget the ball game, and order pizza. Its worth it, and if you pay attention you'll see Peter Jackson take an arrow from Legolas. It may play longer but a smoother flowing movie seems like a faster movie. Just don't pay attention to the clock.The EE doesn't fix the problem with the big battle at Pelennor Fields aka Siege of Gondor. As soon as the ghost army arrives everyone else may as well take up making mayonnaise, because the ghosts spank the bad guys' collective ass. They should've figured out something else to keep the battle edgy. Up to that point it was exciting to see the Riders of Rohan charge and a realistically terrified Eowyn stick it to the Witch King.The Frodo/Sam/Gollum segment is the strongest half of ROTK. If Frodo had any Spidey Sense it would've been tingling around about Chapter 38, but he was not himself anymore. Lugging The One Ring around has taken its toll. Sam is the hero and Middle Earth's Last Best Hope is saved by a gardener, which is better odds than being saved by a politician. Sam would've dived into a dragon's throat to rescue Frodo, and he does something just as hard and much ickier. The film doesn't quite get it across that Shelob is sentient, but it scores high on making her big, smelly and icky, although I was slightly disappointed that she didn't bleed very much green or yellow goo.There's also a lot of finality in the 2 extra discs from the ROTK extended edition. End of Principle Photography, End of Pickup shooting, Last Oscar party, etc... They finished the movies almost 4 years ago and did some touchup pickup shots for it in the summer of 2003. There's more CGI in ROTK than in the previous 2 films combined. The WETA workshop must've wound up with a helluva server farm for all that rendering. It was nice that some of the actors bought the horses they rode on in the films, and there were some other touching 'end of' things happening.This is the best group of movies ever made IMHO. If they never do anything else, the cast and crew have already done enough. Years from now, when they're old or gone, The Lord of the Rings will remain on the short list of serious movie fans, a point of reference to what great movies are. I've imagined lots of stories they could tell with the remaining Hobbits, and Legolas and Gimli were supposedly inseparable so they could've gone on to more adventures, like leading a bunch of dwarfs into Moria. One movie a year would be good.",10,4,9,24 December 2004
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," A powerful followup to the original Star Wars
","This is rated a scoutch lower than the 1st Star Wars flick, although it is right behind Aliens and slightly ahead of T2 as the best sequel ever. It loses 0.3 because of the disjointed forced emotions of Han and Leia, who have great repartee but romance is just not there. I didn't buy it anyway.Other than that the movie is great. It still has some of the best action sequences around and numerous video games have lifted elements of it for combat and light saber duels. The CGI enhancements added in the 90's are less obvious and less intrusive than those in Star Wars, and really add or subtract little if anything. The epic scope of the power of the empire and the considerable abilities of the resistance are shown to great effect in ultra large scale space panoramas, and are breathtaking if you allow yourself to be taken in by it all.The large scale gets a big help with a large screen. I think a lot would be lost watching this on a 27' TV. The DVD is part of the the Star Wars trilogy pack. The audio is even better than Star Wars, with even more LFE and surround action. This has to be the best remastering of film audio I've ever heard. The video is no less impressive, with nary a blotch or smear to be seen anywhere. Darth Vader looks like he's been cleaned and pressed just for this DVD release! This is as good as it gets 10/10.",10,0,1,12 October 2004
Gladiator," You will either love or hate this movie. I loved it!
","That being said, I can honestly say to forget the 'reviews' from those who didn't even sit through the whole movie. That's just whack. But it really is the sort of show that some people just won't like. If you're a history purist, the story and characters just won't add up. But mostly I don't think the negative reviewers see the depth and get annoyed with the violence. The movie does have plenty of violence. But gore? I don't know what Mary Poppins spinoffs they've been feeding on, but there's a whole buncha movies out there that have more gore. Gladiator flashes the 'chop off the arm' or the 'split the skull' scene very quickly. You know it happened but barely see it.There is much more to this movie than action or gore. All the main actors are good or better. I saw a touching scene here, a real feeling there. And hell, no movie and I mean no movie has ever before given viewers so much of ancient Rome to look at. What a great job of computer rendering!For those who haven't been watching movies for 40 years, this is the same basic story that was the basis for the 'Fall of the Roman Empire', made in the 60's. Sophia Loren was Lucilla, Stephen Boyd as Maximus, Christopher Plummer as Commodus and Obi Wan Kenobi as Marcus Aurelius. Similar but different, I prefer Gladiator.",9,0,0,16 May 2000
Donnie Darko," I laughed, I cried...
","I did laugh a little, but didn't cry. Just being different doesn't make a movie good, but this one is a good movie that is definitely different. My own interpretation is that the way it turned out at the end is the way it really happened in the beginning, but we just saw how bad things would've turned out if hadn't happened that way. In other words, if the sky is falling it'll just makes things worse if you try to get out of the way, . That's about as clear as I can get about Donnie Darko. Along the way of making this important point, there was lots of good acting, situation comedy of the darker kind and shameless hypocrisy . The DVD was not the best ever pressed as the video was often grainy and smeary but there are a few interesting extras that you'd never see on a cable/satellite broadcast.",8,0,2,20 June 2004
