Sucker Punch," its brilliant
","the movie starts out cool, gets weird, gets really good and goes back and fourth a lot, your sorta lost and then towards the end it all makes sense., its written very well, they have a lot of great scenes. the cast is very well placed, the scripts totally fine and it has very good production as well as directing and all that other stuff. i hope they make more like this film and its been a lot of fun and i will defiantly watch it again in the future. the only bad thing is at first your totally lost but thats how they want it to be. also i would of preferred someone else besides Emily Browning to play the main character. all in all have fun, it has plenty of brilliant action scenes. if your someone older then you might not like it at all.",8,6,11,29 June 2011
Just Go with It," not what i expected, it turned out good
","i thought i was going to watch a mediocre movie with Adam Sandler. you know what i mean his last few have not been all that. i also thought Jennifer Aniston going to play the same character she always plays who is the loser in a bad relationship on the rebound. you know what i mean as well. well actually she does play the same character slightly better. this movie is fresh, bunch of good laughs and fun to watch. its one of those movies that you might add to your collection. on a side note Brooklyn Decker is a babe. i hope she does more films. one of the better movies out right now. watch this movie i actually recommend it and have fun.",8,2,5,12 June 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," not bad at all
","its a love story type movie and the flick starts slow, gets really really good and not just good its interesting, fun and has your attention, and then towards the end it all gets stupid predictable and boring. Emily Blunt is awesome as always and i wonder if she did her own dance scenes cause its dam impressive. this is a good film to watch and its not a wast of time. Matt Damon is the same guy he always is so don't expect much. Emily Blunt carries the entire movie and it would of been much better if Matt Damon was not in it. not to thrilled that the movie was set in NYC i live here so a few of the scenes were odd then again its a movie so big deal. watch the film have fun",7,0,1,21 June 2011
Elysium," it could of been good
","all right this is the future and our staring character is a hoodlum who does bad things and and works with other villains to over throw the government. it could of been good if it had a few small things like better acting, a better script, better director, producer, soundtrack and just about everything else. the big problem with this movie is that you seen it all before in other movies. so its similar and you felt like you seen it before because you have. the all to familiar soundtrack does nothing but to reconfirm my views of this movie. also whats with all the south African accents and flags in the film and that brings me to another point, this flick has holes in it the size of Texas. i notice things and that's the problem most people will not and will enjoy the film.",2,0,2,20 November 2013
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," this movie is something else
","Michael Bay has more holes in his movies then you can possible imagine, i like detail, thats the way i am i just like stuff that makes sense as it follows its story line. every Michael Bay movie has big holes and the holes just get bigger. enough of that this is a FUN movie, lots of action, some drama and laughs. that girl who replaced Megan Fox is nice but i would of kept fox or gotten someone who could act. Megan would of been so much better for this film. over all its a good movie it surprised me and i think i want to see it again really soon. its actually one of the better films i seen this year. watch it, enjoy it and have fun. i hope they make a lot more of these",7,0,4,9 July 2011
