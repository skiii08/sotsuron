Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," a bit slow at times, but you have to keep in mind something...
","The film is a bit slow at times, but you have to keep in mind that it also sets up 5 other films.  This is only Episode One, and it must run slow in order to set up great action down the road.If you recall Episode Four was slow in points too... and look what happened with it!The lightsaber duel at the end between Darth Maul, Qui-Jinn and Obi-wan was beautifully choreographed, even though the end was a bit anticlimatic.",6,0,1,20 May 1999
