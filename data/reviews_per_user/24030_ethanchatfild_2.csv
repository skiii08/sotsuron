Hereditary," A slow burning yet incredibly gripping horror drama for the ages
","Ari Aster. remember that name. I've always had a fondness of horror with that fondness slowly disappearing over recent years due to some awful horror flicks, but Aster manages to create a vert nuanced yet progressive family drama that turns into a nightmarish horror with one of the best ensemble casts in recent years",9,23,42,16 June 2018
Avengers: Endgame," More than a comic book movie
","Endgame is the pinnacle of what is possible for the comic book genre, the 10 year infinity saga comes to a emotionally satisfying end. And is easily one of the greatest films of all time, it's an experience you will never forget and a film that will never be forgotten.",10,2,3,26 June 2019
