Requiem for a Dream," Wow.. Intense.. Jaw Dropper
","I went and saw this just last night. There were about 40 people in the theater.. Most of them were younger and were high.  Before the movie started everyone was laughing and giggling, however, when the movie ended, it was a completely different scene.  Those same people who were in festive moods were staring at the screen with their jaws dropped.. others were sitting with their face in the hands in disbelief.  What a movie.. the last 30 minutes are about as intense as you can find in a movie.  You will either love this movie or not. Only certain types of people will get it.  If you have experience with drug use in your past you will really understand and comprehend this movie.  wow.. 9 out of 10 stars for me.. my only complaint is the start was a little slow, and I wish it was more intense throughought the whole movie, but I can't complain. What a flick! Go see it on the big screen if possible!",9,0,0,6 December 2000
United 93," surreal
","i normally don't write reviews on movies here, but i felt compelled to write about this one. i was living in Boston when 9/11 went down so all of this was a horrific reminder of those days.i hate to call this a movie because it didn't put me in the movie mood of drinking coke and eating popcorn. i actually felt nauseous after it was over.i felt like i was in the plane and in the command centers with all of those people. as the end was happening, people all around me were crying. personally, i had water in my eyes and could only think what all of those people must have been going through. i can recall at least 5 times when i got the chills and felt the hair stand up on the back of a neck.it was quite an emotional experience for me and the friend i was with.",10,1,4,30 April 2006
Memento," Wow.. What a thinker
","This was a great movie.. But its not a movie for everyone.  You will spend most of the time trying to figure out what the hell is going on and wondering if you are the only one not putting the puzzle together. However, on the way home, me and 4 of my freinds were talking and debating as to what we think actually happened.  This is a great movie for those people who like movies that make you think.",9,0,1,22 May 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Best movie ive seen in a while..
","Unreal fighting scenes... Great dialouge, etc.. My only complaint if I had one is the last 30 minutes or so could have been shrunk to maybe 10 minutes. Other than that you don't feel like you are in a movie for 3 1/2 hours..
Now I need to watch the first 2 again.. :)9.5 of 10 stars..",10,0,0,20 December 2003
