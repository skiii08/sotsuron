Ford v Ferrari," Goes well past 7000 rpm.
","I'll start by saying that I am more of a casual fan of racing (Love rally racing though) , I do adore cars however. ( I adored seeing the Chevy racing team with their Corvettes early on in the movie)
Even if you have no love or interest in either of these, it should still not dissuade you from seeing this movie.The acting is top notch, as you would expect with Bale and Damon at the helm, but the whole cast is stunning. The story is based on the 1966 '24 Hours of Le Mans', and the resounding duel between the all-American, yet struggling Ford racing team and the already legendary Italian Ferrari team.I won't go to much into the plot but, I left the cinema for the first time in awhile feeling fulfilled by a movie, the visuals are excellent the cars and settings accurate and there was clearly oodles of love and adoration poured into this movie.
The racing scenes are the highlight, they are incredibly tense and gripping,making the rivalry between the 2 companies come to a very satisfying boil and conclusion.If you don't understand the love many of us have for cars and racing, this movie will make you understand. It makes me truly happy seeing the passion and love for motor-sports and cars in general being shown by the characters and clearly present in the writers. Bale's performance in particular, almost makes you want to pick up wrench and head for the garage yourself. These characters live and breathe cars and you can feel it.Highly recommended to all audiences.Please Hollywood, more passionate film making like this.",9,1,2,1 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Genuinely Bad.
","Felt like I had to make a review for how bad this was.How did this happen? Disney had unlimited access to money and resources and certainly made the special effects and production LOOK good. This, however has done nothing to dampen the horrifically chaotic story-line.
It feels like fan fiction, the fan service is obvious and cringy, the dialogue is unbearably bad, and the cut and paste mcguffin-based plot all come together to make one of the worst movies of the last few years and BY FAR the worst Star Wars movie ... YES it's worse than the prequels and YES it it worse than the other Disney Star Wars movie.No I am not 'Jumping on the hate-wagon', No I am not leaving a negative review because it is the popular thing to do. I am leaving a negative review because I am a Star Wars fan and Disney need to start making some serious changes if they ever want to make any thing Star Wars that is ever good again.",4,10,17,21 December 2019
