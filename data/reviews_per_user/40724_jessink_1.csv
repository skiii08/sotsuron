Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Not bad!
","People are getting so worked up about how 'racist' and 'rude' this film is! What is it this film, that stuff like Family Guy hasn't done? And that stuff is crude as hell. If you look beneath the crazy get up and accent, the film is actually pretty smart - Cohen comes to America like breath of fresh air, enhancing America's populace with his own equally exaggerated character. I don't think I laughed so much when Cohen wrestled his producer naked, running through a hotel or when he bought a BEAR for god-sake in the back of his ice-cream van (making the kids scream and runaway ... classic.) Yup, the only thing people need these days is a sense of humour.Great film.",8,0,0,16 June 2009
