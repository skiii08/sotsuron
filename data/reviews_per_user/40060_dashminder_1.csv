National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Who uses books in the digital age, anyways?
","Disney seems adept at creating blockbusters, but the trend continues with lack-luster sequels.After the first NT movie, I was hungry for a second... it was original, indulgent (and I suppose liberal) with history to the point that it created primordial stew for mythology. With movies like Sahara and DaVinci Code in between, things could only go up, right? The sequel? Well, they were just plain making stuff up, and reaching to make things more exotic than they needed to be. Details were explained to the point of insulting anyone with the intelligence above an 8 year old, and for all the action, the means couldn't justify the end.Disappointed... glad I didn't see it in the theatre.",4,3,6,1 May 2008
