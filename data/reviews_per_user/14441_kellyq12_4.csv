First Man," Hmm... okay
","What a fascinating topic told in such an uninteresting way. Yes, I get it - Neil Armstrong apparently wasn't very in touch with his emotions (based on the writing/directing and Gosling's performance). But I don't know... I like to FEEL something when I watch a story. Should have been powerful and it felt just okay.",4,3,5,21 October 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Give the Oscar to Rami
",This movie was SO MUCH fun but also full of tons of heart. It's amazing to see in the theater because the music is of course one of the highlights. The recreation of some of the iconic moments were huge. Rami Malek deserves the Oscar!,10,3,4,7 February 2019
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Well-done but Devastating
","Wow. This movie had been on a radar for years, and I finally saw it... This movie was incredibly well-done with an intense ending that brings the story full circle but for a movie that has a young protagonist and is rated PG-13, the story is VERY heavy and devastating. Not the kind of movie I could watch a second time but it was incredibly moving.",8,0,0,7 February 2019
Annihilation," Interesting concept - doesn't totally pay off
","I was really intrigued by this concept and Natalie Portman doesn't ever disappoint as an actress. The story follows a group of female scientists who enter The Shimmer, a mysterious quarantined zone of mutating landscapes and creatures. I loved the tough and brave military women, and it was a fascinating movie where you didn't really know what to expect. The ending, however, (without giving too much away) was a bit murky and not totally satisfying to me. For a concept that was built upon mystery, I would have liked some more answers than were provided. Still, I recommend it though.",7,0,0,15 October 2018
