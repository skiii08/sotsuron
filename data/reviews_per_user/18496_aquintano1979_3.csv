Requiem for a Dream," Wow! That's all that could be said
","I was very shocked by this film. The tone and overall feel of this film is spooky and quite real. I cannot believe the great camera work this movie entails.I really like how the characters develop, especially mom. I cannot put into words how real this problem n America really is. The Director really hit the nail on the head with this one.The acting in this film was also great, from all characters included. I liked how they depicted the withdraw episodes. Although, just the getting high scenes were not as real as I'd like. For the mother though, wow. I think she was my favorite of them all.I do not know how anyone that saw this film did not like it. If not for it's raw content, for the way it was done.",9,0,1,22 December 2004
"I, Robot"," Probably the best Will Smith yet
","I felt the film was certainly Will's best film to date. He actually portrayed a serious character for once. The film's continuity was really good.The overall plot and theme of the film was excellent. I hope when these things really start to come up for real (buying smart robots), they will remember this movie.You know what's funny though? If you watch movies enough you can definitely figure out what is going on, what had happened and what is going to happen. But do not let this concern you. The film flows nicely. Another thing that's funny. As the film goes on one kind of feels sorry for those machines, especially Sonny.This is certainly one of the cooler futuristic films to date, I was very impressed.",8,0,1,22 December 2004
Batman Begins," Why did the story change???
","I have been a Batman fan my whole life. I was shocked and utterly appalled at the fact that they totally changed the story of his parents' death. Why would they do that??? I don't know why, but sure would like to know. For me, it somewhat ruined the film along with the too tight fighting scenes that I couldn't even see what was going on.Another thing that was totally unbelievable was the Assistant D.A.. she looked like she was ten years old and I think they could have found someone a little older to portray such a character.I looked forward to this film and was rather disappointed. Frankly, I do not recommend this film to someone that has any clue about the history of Batman. To someone that does not know him, the movie should be fine.",5,0,3,1 November 2005
