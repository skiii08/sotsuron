First Man," No thanks
","It's my opinion that there is certain stories you shouldn't mess with. This is one. Don't try to be creative and throw in exaggerations or misleading facts about a true event. I haven't seen the movie, never will. They screwed up with the choice to remove the planting of the flag. That was a monumentally important moment and they cut it. Idiots. Another thing that was a semi big deal... Ryan Gosling... I like him as a actor but he was the wrong choice. I would have been happier for a inferior actor so long as they were U.S. born. That's just me.",3,0,2,12 January 2019
Transformers," Only reason is gets 3stars is because of the mom
","I will keep this short. Just about everyone who grew up in the 80s with the cartoon will NOT like this movie. Just about everyone who grew up later will likely think this was great. I did not like this movie, but I will admit there was a couple moments where I forgot what I was watching and enjoyed. Specifically when the mother said something. I believe this movie could have been great if they didn't try to cater to just the new generation of kids. The vehicles obviously couldn't stay the same, but not all of them needed to be GM. Someone who grew up watching the cartoons as a kid would have been a better choice as a director.",3,0,1,2 January 2019
Annihilation," Weird story
","So it was an alien invasion. I'm not sure this movie did anything for me. I wasn't entertained, thrilled, excited or in awe. I don't feel like I wasted my time watching this movie...just wondering what was the point. Don't know what to feel about this weird story. I am glad I didn't spend money besides my prime membership fee to watch this.. this movie is just weird. Whoever wrote the story must have been on drugs...just weird.",3,3,6,18 January 2019
Happy Feet," I read a lot of reviews
",I had read reviews before and after. Pretty much agreed with a lot of the more negative reviews about the story. I liked the music... but don't think this is a great movie for younger children. The penguins only think about sex.,4,0,0,2 February 2019
