The King's Speech," Made for the Oscars
","This is a great movie. The idea of dealing with the year of the three kings (1936) is an original and a good idea, because lots of people ignore that part of British history. But I have mixed feelings, and I can't only praise that film. First, the strength of the movie. I can say that there are top notch actors. Colin Firth is gorgeous as Bertie, and I really think that he deserved an Oscar for his role. And the other actors are good too. Moreover, it is a sentimental movie, you can cry an laugh watching it (the British wit sometimes is awesome). But in spite of an original idea, the film is not original at all. The screenplay is a bit classic (It is expected to win lots of Oscars). Even if the film director has done a solid job, he has not taken any risk, so some moments can be boring. I can speak about one great moment (a little risky), when Bertie loosens up, and has a weird conversation with Logue. But I don't want to tell you the story, because that movie deserves a viewing, and even if it is short of some original shots and conversations, you leave the place full OK joy.",7,2,3,14 May 2011
