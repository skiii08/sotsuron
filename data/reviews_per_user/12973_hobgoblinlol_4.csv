The Expendables 2," Well
","I didn't like the first one that much despite having a kick-ass cast it kinda had a weak story-line. The main thing in Expendables were the actors. And I mean of course it is great to see our favorite action stars come together including retro ones, but the movie didn't have much. It hardly had any villains to stand up to those people besides, Austin who had a decent fight scene and did kick Barney's ass, but then got killed in a very dumb way. Like i said not much of a story line, BUT the sequel changes and improves that as far as i can see.In expendables 2 the story-line is improved, bigger cast is assembled and it has a lot better action including retro stars like Arnold and Willis and Chuck Norris shooting the hell out of everything. In expendables 2 we all so get better villains. Jean Claude Van Damme is a perfect villain and he plays a guy called ''Jean Villain'' which is a cool name, but kinda unoriginal if you get my point. For me, he stole the show, but sadly he wasn't in it much which is a let down. Also, Scott Adkins did a great job too. I really liked Boyka looks he had playing Hector. So, yes, the Villains were pretty cool in this movie. Also, there are so much good cameos and references made in the movie that it cracks me up time to time. Like the part where Dolph calls Arnold ''Terminator'' or when Arnold says his famous line. The thing is that expendables needs work on the story-line and character development. Also, it'll be nice to see them reload more often and of course cliché of 7-8 dudes killing hundreds is in there which enjoyable of course along with rest. Cheesy, but great. And that's what i like about the movie. It's not trying to be God father or Pulp Fiction. It knows that it's just trying to be a kick-ass action film to entertain fans and it is self-aware and yes, i think it does a fine job at it despite some clichés and stuff and it is an awesome movie. But now it has 7.3 and who knows? maybe even lower in other sites sadly. The thing with expendables is that: take ALL of those actors away and replace them with some random dudes. The movie won't be great, because stand-alone story-line and stuff aren't that good. Expendables 2 is a a great, especially for all retro action fans out there. But it needs to work on story-line, suspense, less-clichés and other stuff. If they improve even better for the next Expendables ( i heard Van Damme is coming back as twin brother of Villain which is cool) and give it a much better story instead of mind less shooting it will have a score of 8.0.Now, some cons: Jet Li disappears after the intro scene, Van Damme and Adkins aren't in it much, is little bit cliché, Willis, Norris and Arny aren't in it much too and the fight scene in the and was a let down and was egotistic for Stallone. Van Damme should have got more offense instead of getting punched 50 times by Stallone, he should of kicked Stallone's ass! same thing with Adkins vs Statham. Adkins should of beat Statham's ass. And that's also cliché, because good guys go through everything with ease. There are only few scenes when they take cover. Stallone does get kinda beat up by Van damme, but not enough. Same thing with Statham vs Adkins.Still, a good movie. 6/10 check it out.",6,3,4,11 October 2012
John Wick," Best movie of 2014
","Now, I saw this movie couple of months ago and finally decided to review it. Going in, I thought this was going to be another average, forgetful, one-time film just like most modern movies are, but boy, was I wrong. This movie restored my hope in action movies and broke the monotony that film industry has become for the last 3 - 4 years. I haven't watched a recent movie more than one time for the last three years at least, I watched John Wick 3 times on the other hand which really says something. The thing is that, now days, movies have become business, they have become overabundant and unmemorable, as soon as the movie is released hype dies away and the movie is forgotten, but John Wick finally did something different that reminded of good old times of early 2000's. This movie will be remembered like Collateral and other modern classics. The action is perfect, not to mention, the thing I loved the most is that the world John Wick created, the underworld/syndicate of John Wick is just so intriguing and interesting. Makes you want more, and it definitely made me want a sequel or a prequel. Keanu Reeves did an amazing job depicting the character. The background characters in this movie were also very well written in my opinion and I just love the fact about how revered John Wick is in the movie. The soundtrack is also really good. The movie itself may not be a masterpiece of the decade, but it is a great action flick with a lot of work and thought put into it. It's a hope for the movie industry. 9/10 because this really made me happy and filled me with hope. I rather watch 20 minutes of John Wick than watch another typical Marvel or a superhero brainwashing. Thank you, John Wick for restoring my hope in movies.",9,3,7,13 August 2015
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Did we all watch the same film here???
","Didn't really care for the film when it was first announced mostly because of the odd looking animation and the character Miles Morales, who I'm not a fan of, in this case screamed 'Look! black Spider-Man gets his own movie now!' all over. But after the overwhelming praise this film got, it's every detail from animation to story-telling receiving colossal praise, I had to see it.With all the hype, I thought I was gonna watch a masterpiece that would blow me away and boy, was I wrong. The only thing I enjoyed about this film were some dialogues from classic Spider-Man and noir, Miles felt extremely generic, another story of how someone who isn't talented or capable at first BUT gets better because he 'believes in himself.' of course. The villains in this are just so bad. We have one villain for a simple emotional twist, throw away villains like the FEMALE Doc Ock, Tombstone and Scorpion. And Kingpin another attempt with the overused 'sympathetic villain' trope who's design is absolutely horrendous, it literally looks like his head is attached to his chest, they could have at least given him his classic white suit which they of course didn't. The plot is extremely generic and predictable, it has some decent moments but overall nothing memorable. Don't get me started on the god awful soundtrack.My main problem with this film is the PC, SJW, diversity angle. It's just extremely conspicuous how there's such a HUGE amount of colored people even at a prestigious school that according to liberals are filled with the white privileged elite, it's just so ironic at this point. Even the villains. Either my standards are too high or everyone else's have lowered drastically. I love being proven wrong, I had low expectations when seeing Logan and John Wick 2 and I ended up loving those films. Either this movie is for a certain demographic of specific age or I'm one of the few insane people that think it's extremely overrated. Spider-Man 3 was at least entertaining, this is above everything is just boring.",5,4,7,2 May 2019
Sinister," Terrible
","Simply awful. I waited for this movie expecting it to be good and scary, but it was just stupid. In the first 80 minutes, yes, I guess I'll say first 80 freaking minutes, because 80 minutes fly away like 20 minutes in this crap. So, first 80 minutes the guy is exploring and investigating the tapes to write his book, but I didn't even see him write anything so, it was just waste of time I guess. The murders that he is writing his book about are just stupid and unrealistic as crap. It's just stupid. The movie is like one hour and 40 minutes long and more than half of it feels like an intro! nothing happens. They could have done the the 80 minutes in 20-30 minutes and made the rest of the movie longer and more entertaining, but guess not. So, in the end something ''weird'' happens like the dude gets scared a bit and decides to get away from the house and then guess what? we expect something cool to happen, but no. In the end the writer drinks something and gets knocked out and when he wakes up he sees his little daughter with an axe, possessed...........it was just funny to see that little girl in pajamas was supposed to be ''scary'' this is what's happening to horror movies now days. No more John Carpenters and Hitchcocks. Only dumb people who think that little girls are scary......well, guess what? they're not. It could have been a puppy holding an axe and it would be the same. Even Uwe Boll could have made a better movie. Seriously, it had potential, but this is what directors do now days. they give promises and then throw them into trash.DON'T watch this movie. You think Paranormal activity is bad and stupid? well, it is, but this one is no different. What's with the dumb cliché of trying to make females look scary or badass which they are not. they could have gotten some dude with a knife and mask in the end and turned the movie into average slasher and even that would have been 10 times better than what this crappy movie is. Even the title is kinda stupid. Sinister? it's Sinister how dumb this movie is. Watch Grave Encounters 2 ! it's at least waaaay better than this fail.So, do yourself a favor and skip this. It's just a boring fail. Not scary, not interesting or entertaining. Just a boring, average fail with few jump scares and weird scene with naked ghost kids running around. Also, the characters talk about how people in the town are mean to them, but we don't even see that, because they are in the house the entire movie!!! not only the story line of this movie is a waste of time,but so is this movie.3/10",3,3,7,6 November 2012
