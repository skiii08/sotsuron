It," Beautiful horror Movie
","In my opinion 'It' is visualy one the best and most beautiful horror movies I have seen so far. 
The movie creates a scary atmosphere with some humor.It has charming characters with a good development during the story.
Also Bill Skarsg√•rd shows incredible acting skills and makes Pennywise's appearances so creepy.",8,0,2,29 April 2018
