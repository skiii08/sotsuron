The Hangover," A film which will put a smile on your face.
","When I first came into contact with this film, I wasn't too sure what to expect. Not being a film expert the names in the film meant nothing to me. Well, put it this way, they do now. The best actor without a doubt is Zach Galifianakis, through the entire film his untamed wit and extemporaneous humour will always, at least, give you a giggle. Even though it has been a while since I have seen this film, the memories of first seeing it five years ago still seem fresh, which to me is the mark of a good movie.There is just the right balance of each character and their individual persona so you like & hate them all equally. Firstly there is Phil (Bradley Cooper) who is an average guy with a wild side and a certain likable nonchalant attitude towards situations of peril. Then Stu (Ed Helms), who is the most nervous and least willing to be outgoing: termed the sensible one. Then, Alan (Zach Galifianakis), who is the child of the bunch. one cannot say he is outgoing, as he doesn't intend to be. This can also be applied to his humorous comments. Here, I feel, to illustrate this, it is obligatory for me to make reference to a scene where the three protagonists are shot with tasers (police). In which he laughs and claps when a young child shots Phil with said taser.To end, I can easily say I would happily watch this movie again now, despite the fact that I've seen it twice already.",9,1,3,3 February 2015
