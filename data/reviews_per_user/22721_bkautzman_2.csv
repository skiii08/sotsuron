Lucky Number Slevin," Not perfect, but a refreshing change
","Kudos to Paul McGuigan for directing one of the finest slight-of-hand movies of the year. A second viewing of this flick made me realize how painstakingly obvious the major plot elements were, but my initial viewing had me constantly scratching my head.McGuigan includes a couple of scenes early in the movie that would ordinarily not be missed if they were omitted. However, their inclusion leaves the viewer wondering what importance they have. After a viewing of the movie, one realizes that these scenes' only importance was to make one wonder what their importance was.Add to this outstanding slight of hand the terrific acting by an ensemble of truly outstanding performers. Morgan Freeman gives a riveting performance, as does Josh Hartnett. Bruce Willis, a man who I thought was a great actor mired in a myriad of terrible films, finally finds a film that gives his acting prowess justice. Lucy Liu and Ben Kingsley round out a cast that leaves little to be desired.The movies one weakness is simply the fact that when we add up all of the elements, it is simply a theme that has been done over and over again. So, with a poor score given to originality, the rest of the aspects of this film really round it out. Not a must see, but any devout movie goer will not be disappointed.",8,1,4,17 July 2006
American History X," Perhaps the most powerful film of the 20th Century.
","I won't recommend this movie to the faint at heart. I won't recommend it to anyone who is easily swayed by propaganda. I will, however, recommend this move to anyone who is open minded enough to understand that the material portrayed in this movie is real.Perhaps the most disturbing part about this movie is the fact that the actions and events contained within are the actions and events in every day America. Filled with powerful imagery and outstanding acting, American History X conveys emotion so vivid and so powerful, the meek will have a hard time stomaching it.Norton's character is so powerful, he could sway even the most devote civil right's leaders with his rhetoric. That is what makes modern day leaders in this regard so scary. When a person such as Norton can spew forth such crap with such conviction, he is a person to be feared. I do not know of another actor who could portray Derek Vinyard as effectively as Norton did.While Furlong's performance isn't quite as convincing as Norton's, he does portray a corrupted innocence that made me actually care for him. By then end of the movie, I felt like he was my little brother.This is one of the most powerful movies I have ever watched. It gets a perfect 10 on a 10 scale, and I'm pretty conservative when handing out 10's. This one goes on my top 10 list of 'all time greats'.",10,1,2,11 April 2006
