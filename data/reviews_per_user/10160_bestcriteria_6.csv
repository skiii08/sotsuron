The Monuments Men," Extremely boring
","I was not expecting combat action, or a whodunit type thriller, but I was totally disappointed with the slow pace and the total lack of suspense.The dialog was not witty or even interesting. The actors are first class, but are wasted. Other reviewers have said that Kate Blanchett steals the show, but there is nothing to steal, and she hardly is in the movie, and when she does appear, we are left with a 'is that all?' feeling. Other characters play their parts as though they were visitors in the set.There were two or three instances where I was tricked into thinking that something exciting was going to happen, but the subject ended abruptly and the boring and easily anticipated theme was back.I wanted to like the movie so badly that I was successful in staying awake for about 45 minutes, but then was in and out until the last 20 minutes, where the pace picked up from snail to turtle pace.",Null,22,36,14 February 2014
Mission: Impossible III," Simply put: I wish I had not seen it
","I was a big fan of the TV series, I liked MI-1, and I liked MI-2 even better, so I was really looking forward to MI-3.Unfortunately, I was thoroughly disappointed. The plot was typical MI, which is OK with me, and the acting was as would be expected from the experienced and known cast. Nothing notable on either count.The special effects... well, what can be said anymore of what the movie gurus are able to do to get our attention and impress us with their skills and application of technology.What really got to me, though, was the actual presentation, filming, and editing. It seems that every action shot; i.e., scenes involving car chases, crashes, shoot-outs, and fights, lasted a second or two, and the camera was within a few inches of the action. Most of the time I couldn't tell what was really happening as from an observer's point of view - everything was right up to my face and the segments too short lasting.Perhaps this is done in purpose - since it is almost impossible to detect continuity, attention to these details (continuity) is not necessary. MI-3 is just another of the movies I have seen recently that suffers from these maladies, and I hope that Hollywood steps back a bit, slows down, and allows us to enjoy (and actually be able to watch) what transpires instead of blasting away close up after close up.",2,2,6,6 May 2006
United 93," Excellent and hard hitting even though we know the outcome
","Of course, the outcome is predictable; but the movie does well in its portrayal (or speculation) of what happened. Based on the documented telephone calls from many of the passengers to their loved ones on terra-firma, the movie does lend authenticity to the events as they unfold.As most people also will say, I remember exactly what I was doing when 9/11 took place. And having two sons in the military; one a pilot who was scrambled, albeit not in that specific area, and the other working in The Pentagon that very day, I have a very vivid recollection of the precise sequence of events. Nevertheless, I still found the movie to be gripping, and even suspenseful, considering the premise.",10,9,18,28 April 2006
The Maze Runner," Too contradictory and illogical
","The movie is watchable and perhaps entertaining, but my wife did not like it at all. We both like thrillers, but this one was questionable at best as such.Problems: A large group of teenage boys, on their own with no adult direction or counseling, and they all seem to get along well? Ha! I was in an orphanage where we were over 20 boys about the same age as in the movie, and I can tell you that the movie's portrayal is not realistic. These boys are at the prime age when sex is practically the most important thing in their lives, there are no girls around, and everything is OK? Finally, when a girl shows up, none of the boys has any desire for her? Ha!And in spite of all this, some of the boys in the beginning appear to be fine with the notion of not trying to escape?The filming of the boys fighting with the monster is poorly done and the audience cannot tell what is happening. All the scenes are very up close, short duration, and definitely nothing but confusing. Contradictions (maybe mild spoilers?) The boys have managed to create a detailed model of the maze. Yet, at the beginning of the movie we are told that the maze changes daily, and based on the changes we see happen, there is no way that a model could be made. If the designated boys would be capable of 'mapping' a portion of the maze each day, by the time they mapped another portion the following day, the previous day's rendition would likely already be obsolete.The monster evidently is man-made, and its legs, stingers, and so on appear to be made of steel. Yet, the boys can hurt and even defeat the monsters with crude wooden spears.",4,133,213,21 September 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Disappointed
","According to the comments I had read, I was expecting this movie to be somewhat of a serious attempt to portray real pirates via some sort of mystery and perhaps romantic plot. I certainly had no idea that it was going to be more like Sinbad fighting skeletons. And speaking of skeletons, why would anyone engage an adversary in any kind of a fight with swords, muskets, or whatever if it is known that the enemy cannot be killed or harmed under the existing circumstances? Why bother to do so under the moonlight?Contrary to other's views, I had to struggle to keep my attention focused. The movie is too long. Depp does a good job, he is a fine actor. But the truth is that the character he portrays is not the type that I like to see as a lead role at all. There were other fine performances as well, but overall, I would rather be entertained by Geena Davis in Cutthroat Island any day. Ditto my wife.",Null,0,1,13 July 2003
Van Helsing," Too much too fast - was it any good? I didn't like it.
","The effects were well done, but what's new about that anymore? There was so much going on, and the sequences cames and went to fast that I felt as though I was missing a lot of the story. I liked Kate, as in 'Underworld', but she was wasted here. Besides, even for a 'fiction' movie, there was a lot of nonsense.Both my wife and I, who are fans of the 'Matrix' (only the first one, though), 'X-Men' (first one was better), 'Underworld', and many other actions flicks, could not wait for 'Van Helsing' to be over! I believe I would rent it when it comes out so I can see what I may have missed. (4/10 stars at best)",Null,0,0,10 May 2004
