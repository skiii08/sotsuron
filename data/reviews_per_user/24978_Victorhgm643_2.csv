First Man," Perfect synchronized Directing, Sound and Cinematography makes First Man one of the best biopics of this decade
","For me, Chazelle's First Man could have gone anywhere in the drama spectrum and yet the young director surprised me with his choices. To be honest, choice (maybe sacrifice) is a very important word in this movie. Like I said, It could have gone for some sort of easy emotional drama, just using Neil's life as a background for cheap feelings and/or unnecessary heavy scenes. As the movie progresses, we can easily notice that is not what happens. The tone in every scene is dictated by Chazelle's choices of how this story should be told with his crew and by the choice to deconstruct and humanize the legend, even if it means a slower pace, instead of just showing what he did. The movie succeeds in making us try to feel like he felt.Let's begin with Cinematography. It's the second time Damien Chazelle and Sandgren are working together and I can presume they are already pretty comfortable with each other's job (as if they didn't won an oscar for La La Land). The shaky documental camera style might be the reason for some nausea problems for some people, but it wasn't for me. It just added more depth to the mystery of Neil's personality and his special moments, also highlighted by the vintage/homemade look the film acquired by shooting in film. There is only one time in the movie that this type of camera is not used, for a specific good reason, with great response from the choice.When it comes to Chazelle, Justin Hurwitz is a veteran: four movies Damien directed, four of them Justin scored. Ah, also won an Oscar for La La Land too, but who didn't right? First Man is scored with 3 or 4 motifs, some wich combined during the scenes to create more depth to each look and thought. I think maybe there is one of them out of tone (not tune) with the movie, but I could understand why that moment required a different piece of music, that's ok. Some eerie sounds used in the right time to punctuate the strangeness of the unkonw, the elevation of the orchestra to increase the tension/emotion of the scenes and voil√†. See you in february Mr. Hurwitz, I hope.However, if a movie about Neil Armstrong didn't have a good convincing Neil Armstrong..Know what? Nevermind. Ryan Gosling was an absolute monster as the main protagonist. Reserved, quiet, determined and mysterious just as the real astronaut, Gosling delivers maybe the best performance of his career, aware of every little detail of the scene and very sensitive to the eyes of the camera. Claire Foy does not stay behind and evens the game in every scene she could. She is persistent through the movie and a more attentive moviegoer should be able to decode her looks and personal arc by the end of the movie. And that look, God that look.First Man is a lesson of how good (conscious) teamwork can bring great rewards, and I'm not just talking about the space race. Directing, Cinematography, Score and Cast were in perfect harmony in every frame. Expect to see this film to win some technical Oscars, like Sound Mixing, Sound Editing, Editing itself and be nominated to many other: Actor, Supporting Actress, Director, Original Score, Cinematography and Best Picture. Really, they deserve it. I can't tell if they will win or not, like Neil couldn't say if he was going to come back. But if a movie could make me really feel the extraordinary beautiful oddness (really, I've never felt something like this) of being the first to step on the moon, even for a fraction of a second, God they deserve a chance to try.",9,1,4,27 October 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Poorly written, Bohemian Rhapsody is a disappointment
","Sometimes there's a movie that really divides critics and audience. Sure a movie about one of the most iconic person of Rock (and music in general) should make Bohemian Rhapsody one of them, and it does. Honestly, the movie it's not bad -not totally- but it is messy. The structure is messy, the timeline is wrong and the characters are more selfaware than they need to be, but more on that later. It felt like they wanted to make a love letter to Queen, but the structure wasn't even nearly satisfactory as it should be, resulting in a Russian Roulette of cheap emotions and an unclear message by the end.Rami Malek is good as Freddie Mercury, reproducing several peculiarities of the original artist, but for me his acting was more of a series of impressions (a caricature) then a true representation. Don't get me wrong, it's still very good and very unique, but I've seen another Biopic this year (First Man) and by comparing the protagonists, I feel that Gosling's Armstrong is more of a 'character' then Malek's Freddie and I don't know whose fault it is. Anyway, great casting too, I honestly want to know how they rejuvenated Brian May and taught him to act so fast. But even with a cast almost identical to the original band, the movie restricted everyone so they could make Freddie the absolute main character.This and other things are totally the screenplay's (and the people who wrote it) fault. And there's some Bryan Singer there too. The movie paints Freddie as a legend, a god from the first to the last frame, never letting us empathize with his character, his struggles or his wins. We're humans, the movie needs to humanize its protagonist so we can sympathize with him. The film even has a 'bad influence' character so we could put all of Freddie's faults on him, what a shame. It seems like every single person involved with the band (except that one producer) was aware of what Queen means today. They're always convicted
that they would be successful, talking and acting this way, at least it's how the story shows us. The screenplay also manipulates time and events to fit the narrative created to the movie. Rock in Rio was in 1985 with a very well know Queen, not in '79. Freddie discovered he had AIDS in 1987 and definetely did not use it as 'plot point' to empower the Live Aid performance, and he didn't was the first to go solo too, making an entire scene insincere. Propably one of the most poorly written scripts of the year.I honestly don't know where it's totally Bryan Singer's fault or some kind of Studio's censorship, but this movie is flat in emotions. Everytime the band argues about something there is a miraculous riff that saves the scene and in the next one everything is alright, they have a new song to perform. Unfortunately, not even an inspired Rami Malek and the Live Aid performance reproduction (which was cool) could save the picture. Makes me wonder how Sacha Baron Cohen wanted to make it. Probably he wanted to make a true Biopic of Freddie's life, not just a stack of exposition scenes.Probably he wanted to make it right.",1,69,111,11 November 2018
