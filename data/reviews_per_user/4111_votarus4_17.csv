Marie Antoinette," Among the Worst Films of All Time
","Complete insanity to focus on Marie Antoinette at the center of one of modern history's most defining events, yet at the exclusion of history itself. That kind of solipsism is historical denial, and we do not applaud untruth. The real M.A. was not so enigmatic after all. Quite self-aware, never that powerful, certainly not the semi-impaired cupcake of Ms. Coppola's vision. Nothing, nothing! of three concurrent wars bankrupting a nation, the corruption of the Estates General, the Affair of the Necklace. And most importantly -- nothing of the rancid Duc d'Orleans, royal court cousin, chiefly responsible for M.A.'s rise in society, the overshadowing of Pompadour, duBarry, etc. It was Orlean who undermined the throne, spread pornographic images of the real M.A., fostered revolution and then hoped to inherit from a disgraced Louis a grateful nation returning to his version of monarchy. And So Much More. Coppola erases history and gives us instead a costume show. Frankly, that particular costume show was on display in 1975's Oscar-winner for costumes (also M. Canonero 'Barry Lyndon'), and no surprises here.",1,11,18,15 April 2007
Alexander," Alexander  an Instant Camp Classic
","Oliver Stone has imagined a vigorous, opulent homage to the Sword and Sandal genre, and like the best of those films of a generation ago, sheer visual style, over-the-top acting, and showmanship win the day. The best of those films-Lawrence of Arabia, Ben-Hur and Spartacus-also had brilliant scripts, pitting their protagonists in the center of conflicts where superhuman will and wit overcome immense odds. But as history's first and most insatiable conqueror, Alexander seems unchallenged. Mighty ancient cities fall beneath his sword like so much marshmallow, and his one true enemy-Darius, King of Persia-has no words in Stone's film at all!-he's just a face. Thus, without a central conflict to dramatize, Stone's film lowers itself to the Sword and Sandal genre's middle road, where writing takes a back seat, and characters make portentous pronouncements before going off to fulfill their destinies. Angelina Jolie, as Olympias, Alexander's mother, comes off best and worst in Stone's decadent stew. Her unnatural devotion to Alexander seems to inspire the 'You-Must-Conquer-the-Known World' flame, but she's quickly side-lined by the script and is left screaming in the wilderness, having no real effect on the ensuing action. But she looks magnificent, and her face at the moment of Philip of Macedonia's death, is alone worth the price admission. Her Transylvanian accent, however, is a distraction, as are the Irish, English and Scottish dialects of other actors. Stone's script also avoids Alexander's more elaborate military strategies-studied and duplicated for thousands of years-and makes short shrift of the ongoing power struggles he had with his generals. Colin Farrell, as Alexander, works hard and holds the screen for 3 hours with a strange mix of petulance, arrogance and good old fashioned Hollywood charm. He and Jared Leto, as Hephaistion, have a long and tender love scene (fully-clothed) on a Babylonian balcony, looking down on what has to be the most opulent scenery ever devised for a feature film. This is a clear, if telescopic homage to D.W. Griffith's 1916 Masterpiece, 'Intolerance.' All in all, Stone's Alexander is never boring, never brilliant, but always visually exciting. Probably the most gorgeous film made in years. Terrific showmanship. 7/10",7,8,13,28 November 2004
The Others," Nicole Kidman Channels the Dead; Grace Kelly Lives (Possible spoilers...)
","'The Others' is full to the brim of wondrous and surprising things -- First and foremost, a script that opens like a Venus Flytrap -- exotic, seductive, deadly -- It dares us to look away, tantalizes, takes its time, invites us in, then closes like a vise on a simple, terrifying conceit:  Do the dead haunt the living, or do the living haunt the dead?  Amenabar's graceful, powerful writing and directing deserve our praise.  The cinematography of The Others is breathtaking --every shot seems composed from a nightmare, but one just out of the reach of true memory.  Fans of Christopher Eccleston (I am) will be delighted with his astonishing, almost wordless appearance. Fionnula Flanagan (Mrs. Mills), and the two children give performances that can only be described as delicious.  NICOLE KIDMAN accomplishes something very rare here.  Not only does she serve the story, fitting the character like a glove, she conjures forth the bewitching image of GRACE KELLY in her prime.  This coincidence is not lost on Mr. Amenabar, whose camera captures Kidman in that rapturous, Hitchcockian way:  swirling down staircases, hovering at waist level, gliding like a predator, circling upward to the precise moment of profile.  Indeed, Ms. Kidman's embodiment of the late Grace Kelly is so startling, so uncanny, I was convinced there were two ghost stories unfolding simultaneously:  one in a haunted house; the other being a legendary actress reaching across decades to possess the soul of another.",Null,0,0,19 August 2001
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Sweeney Todd: A Big Bloody Mistake
","Fans of the Tim Burton-Johnny Depp franchise can rejoice, and as usual, leave their critical faculties at the door. Their heroes have come through, spraying the screen with ketchup, acting the gamut from A to B, yelling their way toward Oscar noms. Or not. For the rest of usaware that Sondheim's great score is also the high point of late-20th Century music theatrethe movie Sweeney Todd is a noisy, thudding, completely unsatisfying bore. Depp starts out angry and goes nowhere. The voice is thin, reedy, and often overpowered by Jonathan Tunick's aggressive orchestrations. Depp barely manages to even look at Helena Bonham-Carter, and she, as Mrs. Lovett, connects only to little Ed Sanders--who as Toby, steals every single scene he's in. In other words, the chemistry is off, off, OFF. Alan Rickman is the sexiest Judge Turpin on record, but must make due without singing the great 'mea culpa.' Anthony and Johanna are sung by pretty actors who have little to no impact whatsoever, and Burton leaves their story unresolved. I enjoyed Sacha Baron Cohen as Pirelli, but don't think he was right for his role either. Again, Ed Sanders as Toby was amazing, but that's not the reason we go to see Sweeney Todd. In the words of the real fright master, Bela Lugosi, 'Beware, beware, beware.'",1,17,45,26 December 2007
Lost in Translation," Lost in translation and Instantly Forgettable
","`Lost in Translation' can be summarized as `Italian-American Girl Makes Bittersweet French Film in the Style of Godard in Far Away Japanese Metropolis'.  And, WOW, does it NOT WORK.  Unfortunately Ms. Coppola neglected to write a script.  Instead, she fixes her camera on a pensive, depressed Bill Murray and a pensive, depressed Scarlett Johanson, failing to put a single compelling thought in either of their heads.  In a plastic/electric version of Japan these two lock retina, and virtually no one in their orbit seems more real than an animated stereotype  all the Japanese entertainment industry folks yell, whimper, simper or just plain freak out.  But no one talks or says anything meaningful, because there is no plot and no script to indicate a plot.  Same with the Americans, who arbitrarily wander in front of the camera.  Giovanni Ribisi, Scarlett's photographer husband, seems to be in another film, not even aware of his wife's needy, private world of self-indulgence and vague personal crisis. There are some spectacular shots of Mount Fiji.  Other than that, there's no movie here at all.  Ms. Coppola obviously has a fine directorial eye, but her ear for dialogue and instinct for story are immature at best.",2,5,10,3 October 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," What new devilry is this???
","If you can see past the non-stop special effects, beautiful fantasy landscapes and wonderfully committed performances, you'll realize that the script for this elephant is turgid to the point of fossilization. Unspeakable dialogue beneath swooping camera moves can't hide the fact that there is not a single interesting idea in three hours of exposition.  Quest, quest, quest.  The ring is evil.  Quest, quest, quest.  The folks who voted this film up there in the company of Godfather and ABOVE Citizen Kane in the IMDB list -- well, all I have to say is -- you need to take a crash course on 10 decades of film history.",1,4,11,14 August 2002
Pitch Black," THAT GOSH-DARNED ECLIPSE!
","After arriving at the unpersuasive theory that a tri-solar system can mechanically morph to an eclipse formation (HUH???!), the writers of 'Pitch Black' run out of all plot ideas and subject us to yet another sci-fi, sit-com, bug hunt.  ('They mostly come out at night . . . .  Mostly' -- Newt, Aliens)  A word to hard-core SF thrill seekers:  AVOID THIS FILM. There's nothing here except a witty muscleBorg and the usual coterie of empty-headed space muffins sitting around in the dark, wringing their hands, posing among the wreckage.

Apocalypse Now," REDUX: The Law of the Jungle; the God of War
","APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX has grown exponentially in substance and theme from its prior incarnation.  (Possible spoilers....)  If films like Platoon, Deerhunter and Full Metal Jacket appear a bit shallow in the wake of Redux, perhaps it's because Coppola's vision now transcends the Viet Nam debacle entirely, and is more concerned with the very meaning of War, like Homer's Illiad/Odyssey; and the tangible pathway to Hell, like Dante's Inferno.  The Apocalypse difference being that the river Styx IS the journey (where Dante merely crosses over; where Homer crosses an ocean into battle, then strands the homeward Odysseus for 10 years).  The presence of women and sex in Redux is a dramatic literary shift from Apocalypse's prior version.  Where the primary mission had a near-perfect trajectory to the Kurtz malignancy, Playboy Bunnies, once a sideshow, now become mainstage Sirens.  The lure of Sex becomes a palpable reminder of mortality, and the constant presence of Death.  As the Frenchwoman (Aurore Clement) says, men have split themselves in two--living life paradoxically, as both warrior and lover.  This is not without consequences.  Unlike Homer's Odysseus, Martin Sheen's Willard is completely in control, not swayed by temptations of the journey.  Or is he? Circe and the Sirens may be momentary distractions, but what exactly is waiting for him upriver?  The new French Plantation scene offers an important demonstration of just how far 20th Century imperialism, colonialism and political/military misadventuring can go.  It also adds an explicit, intellectual indictment, missing from version one, that can be summed up in a single line:  'There was no such thing as the Viet Cong before Americans were here!'  But back to the River...  The journey now is longer, and Brando-Kurtz's presence looms larger than ever.  So large in fact, once we get there, Kurtz's meticulous animal logic threatens to swallow Willard's mission whole.  But Kurtz, having found the Law of the Jungle, having become the God of War, realizes he must pay the price of realizing such an elemental ambition.  He toys with Willard; a fatal, intentional mistake.  Willard completes the mission, stands on the temple's platform and wavers (feels much longer in Redux(?)).  Time stops as a thousand people bow to their knees; and herein lies the dark heart of the film.  Does Willard drop the machete, walk down the steps, go on playing soldier, or does he turn around, walk inside, and play God?",Null,0,0,5 September 2001
Gone with the Wind," GWTW -- The Hollywood Sex Magic History Machine
","The creators of WIND did not envision a 65-year life to their work.  Indeed, David O. Selznick sold his interest in the film within years; Margaret Mitchell remarked on publication that she hoped the book would sell a few thousand copies(!).  So it's a huge mistake to judge WIND on any terms but its own -- what it 'was', and then, what it 'is'.  Today we see a colorful, vividly realized costume epic.  But in 1939, it seemed like the Sistine Chapel had come to life and was appearing at the downtown Rialto.  Forgive the silly metaphor, but you get what I'm after -- the size and scope of WIND on film had no precedent.  Released in the shadow of the Great Depression, WIND in hindsight is less about the Civil War than a nation's slow crawl out of recent poverty.  When Scarlett said `I'll never be hungry again,' the nation rose and said `Damn Right!'  The moment was set to fiery, defiant music, and the illusion of America, as she wanted to see herself, was set. History, right or wrong, was suddenly embodied by a sexy young girl who wants, not just to survive, but to prosper.  Powerful stuff.  But is that enough to hold our attention, year after year, decade after decade?  WIND is still visually persuasive and always will be.  Max Steiner's score beneath those images cannot be underestimated -- there had never been so much music outside the realm of grand opera.  Music completes the illusion.  The script however, full of momentum, has little substance.  It weakens as years go by. Mitchell was no Tolstoy, but her brilliant novel is condensed to a long, shallow, sentimental melodrama.  The writing is redeemed only by two key performances:  Hattie McDaniel, as Mammy, is the first African American allowed to create a real human being on screen (for that we thank David O. Selznick); and of course, Vivien Leigh's complex, amazingly sexual Scarlett. In a strange mix of glamour and guts, the vortex of her acting seems to create the film around her; she wills it to happen.  After 35 years of watching, I've come to regard her as, not merely the leading actress, but the real director of Gone With the Wind -- and the reason to keep watching.",10,2,3,23 February 2003
Moulin Rouge!," A Visionary Masterpiece... And the Best Picture of 2001
","Not a question in my mind that Moulin Rouge should have won the 2001 Best Picture Oscar.  This film took guts to make.  To mix the Dumas 'Camille' story into the La Boheme Paris of Lautrec and Puccini, then to toss in pop hits spanning the past several decades is, well, a stroke of interpretive (if anachronistic) genius.  As for Kidman's performance -- WOW!  Couldn't take my eyes off of her.  Think of the great actresses and singers coming before her in prior tellings of that story:  Bernhardt, Duse, Garbo, Callas, Stratas.  Kidman stands and delivers in the midst of a thumping phantasmagoria that somehow does recall the excitement, danger and romance of a long-gone era -- and, like the story requires, does it like a diva. All the men are excellent, of course, Ewan MacGregor, Jim Broadbent. Brilliant cinematography, rightfully quoting the great paintings of the era. Baz Lurhman resurrects an old chesnut of a story with the eye of an impressionist master and the ear of a rock and roller -- how'd he do that? Yes, indeed -- Moulin Rouge is a great film.",Null,1,2,5 October 2002
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Pseudo-intellectual claptrap of the Charlie Kaufman Kind
","(Spoiled...) Like the rest of Kaufman's self-absorbed hallucinations, Eternal Sunshine fails to jump the 'who cares' hurdle. What an overwrought mess of a movie. As far as that mind-surgery-memory-deleting helmet goes, why in tarnation was Jim Carrey's character--a self-described uninteresting bore--so very talented at resisting the program? No mental giant, he would have succumbed immediately. End of movie. But no! We replay this deja vu game of meeting forgotten lovers into infinity, while every character gets thrown into stylistic outer space: Comedy for some, tragedy for others, sex farce when Mr. Kaufman runs out of ideas. Actually, apart from Sunshine's tangled structure, there are no ideas. Not once are we given useful, relevant information about anyone who inhabits the film. Carrey and Winslet's megawatt dual-presence is wasted inside of a situation that resembles a hamster cage, not a story. Only Tom Wilkinson, as the memory-deleting helmet inventor, seems to grasp the danger of what's happening. Kaufman, however, surrounds him with a gang of assistants who are giggling morons. What a sad, confused, irrelevant film. I was reminded more than once of the forgotten French mind-game films of the sixties. Marienbad, anyone?",1,95,200,21 November 2004
Life Is Beautiful," this is what I wrote a friend about 'life is beautiful'...
","astonishing.  thanks so much for the recommendation.  i suspended my identity in favor of his and when he loosened his grip at the end i pretty much fell apart -- couldn't remember who i was.  from the faces of the other audience members, they were going through the same thing.  Not to exaggerate, but i don't think anyone has gone to the heart of masculine/feminine comedy/tragedy with that big a presence since Garbo in the 1930s.  If i'm right, this is causing an earthquake in hollywood, because he'll be altering the landscape of acting (like brando did in the 50s with 'streetcar' and 'on the waterfront').  Perhaps ACTING will once again be at the center of the cinema industry, where it currently is not.  all hail roberto benigni.",10,1,2,31 May 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," An incontrovertible masterpiece -- 'Caviare to the General'
","Kubrick's enigmatic final film stands beyond criticism and far, far above the perceptions and misperceptions of his audience.  I remember the controversies caused by 'Clockwork Orange' and 'Barry Lyndon'.  Does Kubrick really owe us the linear-narrative, tidily resolved plots we chew up like popcorn from other filmmakers?  The answer is emphatically 'NO!'. Shakespeare's Hamlet said it best:  'for the play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas caviare to the general:  but it was--as I received it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine--an excellent play'.  Apologies (or not) to those who find Kubrick 'slow' and 'boring' -- you must take another look.  But hey!  If all I filled my head with was MTV pop-candy, a Mozart opera might prove a bit daunting, even slow and boring.  EYES WIDE SHUT takes a rare journey into REAL terror -- a soul-shaking nightmare of modern life with all the attendant paranoias, delusions and temptations.  Bravos to Cruise-Kidman who easily surpass their earlier work.  To Kubrick: I am on my knees in awe and admiration.  You've delivered a masterpiece.  Thank you.",Null,0,0,12 March 2000
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A meaningless experience
","There's no story here at all.  Harry P. and company move from one disconnected episode to another with little regard for what's come before. The game of quidditch (whatever) seems thrown in for gee wiz; it certainly has nothing to do with plot.  By the time we move through the maze of Hogwart's gigantic cavernous structure (how many wizards are pupils here -- 25,000???) I forgot all about (and didn't care about) that silly red stone. Wonderfully talented cast (Rickman, especially, doing a dead-on imitation of Olivier's Richard III).  Pedestrian, paceless, unimaginative direction.  But when a film makes a billion dollars, that hardly matters.  Actually, the DVD extra features are more imaginative and fun than the film itself.  I understand that kids all over the world are racing towards reading, just to get into the Harry Potter phenom.  That's cool.",Null,0,0,22 June 2002

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I grooved on the Morpheus-speak, and I expect the redundant loop (of which Oracle slyly spoke; and Architect totally spewed truth) will be interrupted and the foretold Revolution will happen.

A Beautiful Mind," The Hollywood Stamp of Excellence?
","(SPOILERS) To Russell Crowe's credit, he resists the temptation to wallow in Akiva Goldman's overwrought, pseudo-Greek tragedy of a script to deliver a fairly compelling performance.  Nash's story IS compelling; however, Ron Howard (director) misses every opportunity to tell it or interpret it. Again and again, he resorts to safe, traditional, manipulative, Hollywood direction and refuses to enter Nash's mind and relay his experience in a visual or metaphorical way (refer to Aronofsky's brilliant 'Pi').  We are instead given car chases, conspiracy theories, imaginary friends, sentimental scenes with fountain pens, but alas, no interesting camera work. That's a pity.  Roger Deakins' cinematography (with the Coen Brothers, for instance) is usually astonishing. Here, it's merely serviceable.  Howard reigned Deakins in for all the wrong reasons.  Lastly, the Academy of Blah, Blah, Blah is just as predictable, misty-eyed and conservative as it has always been.  A Beautiful Mind was certainly not the best picture of last year.",4,0,1,8 July 2002
The Bridge on the River Kwai," KWAI -- NOW
","Without belittling `Kwai,' it does seem, looking backwards at David Lean's career, to be a dress rehearsal for the more operatic, tightly controlled (and better written) `Lawrence of Arabia.'  Alec Guiness's passionate, detailed performance as Colonel Nicholson, above all other factors, makes Kwai a still watchable and important experience.  The screenplay, however, divides unevenly between those who must build the Bridge and those who must destroy it.  Ebert, in his Great Movies article, correctly identifies William Holden's character in Kwai as undergoing an implausible transition from escaped POW to martini-guzzling playboy to selfless war hero. Verbatim:  `Holden's character, up until the time their guerrilla mission begins, seems fabricated; he's unconvincing playing a shirker, and his heroism at the end seems more plausible.'  That, I believe, is also Kwai's greatest weakness.  Holden's relationship with Jack Hawkins (playing a parallel role to his General Allenby in Lawrence) seems pallid next to the mighty Guiness/Hayakawa standoff  in fact, it seems to be in another movie altogether.  Also, Malcolm Arnold's score, which I loved when I was a kid, seems now jarringly inappropriate from start to finish.  I am too much influenced, I suppose, by the rock and roll jungle menace of Coppola's `Apocalypse Now.'  Lastly, it is many decades past 1957.  Images of whistling soldiers, marching proudly after months of captivity, then putting on an `entertainment' more expected in the world of Rodgers and Hammerstein, may ring very false to today's viewer.  But keep your eyes fastened tight to Alec Guiness.  Kwai is the Everest of his career, and very few actors climb that high.",Null,36,64,3 September 2002
