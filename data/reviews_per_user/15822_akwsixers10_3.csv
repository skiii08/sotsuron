Hereditary," A new horror classic, tense and terrifying
","I rarely write reviews for films on here with the exception of two cases: when a movie is really bad or when a movie needs defending from a vocal minority that trash it. First, I'll review the film like I would any other and then I'm going to try and reason why audiences are reacting negatively to the film. I'm not sure if Hereditary is the greatest horror film ever but I certainly felt like I was watching my generation's Exorcist or Rosemary's Baby. The movie borrows heavily from those two films right down to the final scene. Despite this, it feels new and dangerous. I had no idea how the movie was going to play out which is a criticism I have with a lot modern horror/thriller movies. This in large part has to do with the marketing campaign but more on that later. I feel the term slow burn has a negative connotation associated with it and prefer to call this movie tense. It doesn't really on jump scares that plague a lot of modern horror and chooses tension and imagery to scare the audience with slow camera panning and fantastic cinematography, a nervous score, and great performances. Toni Collette gives and incredible performance as a manic mother who is mourning the loss of a parent. The supporting cast is fantastic as well and they all have a time to shine at some point in the movie. The movie is also challenging in its themes with relationships between parents and their children always in the forefront. The human drama of this movie far exceeded my expectations and is worthy viewing in its own right. To try and explain why audiences are trashing the film through some mediums (not as much on IMDb, see CinemaScore, Rotten Tomatoes for example) I think it is important to understand that we live in an impatient culture. Many horror classics of the past like the two I mention earlier weren't fast paced and instead lingered on images and favored slow paced horror. I think the modern horror audience can get restless when presented with a movie like this. I don't think Rosemary's Baby or the Exorcist would review very well with broad audiences if they were released today. Secondly, I think the film has succeeded in making people uncomfortable by questioning parent's feelings for their children and how they are displayed. This movie is complex and has a lot to say. Comparing this film to another fantastic horror movie from this year, A Quiet Place, offers a great juxtaposition of this idea. One is very simple in it's premise that quickly gets to the scares while the other takes it's time to build to a climax that may or may not be worth the wait depending on the viewer. Overall, Hereditary offers plenty of horrific imagery and supernatural scares that work as a deeper examination of familial relationships rather than being a string a horror movie cliches.9/10 - excellent",9,352,606,10 June 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Arguably Marvel's best yet, a fun, hilarious, colorful feature that delivers the years best twist
","I didn't think I would come out of the theater from Homecoming with the thought in my mind that this movie features the most effective plot twist of any movie this year. I certainly won't spoil it because it makes the movie and is so perfectly done that it was enough to bump this movie up to a 10/10. Tom Holland does amazing work as Peter Parker/Spiderman and is most certainly the most believable and effective actor to portray the actor on the big screen to date. We knew he was good from Civil War but a standalone feature of his own really allows him to embody the geeky and reckless side of the character. This Spiderman isn't very good at his job initially, but develops into an effective Avenger with the hilarious guidance of Tony Stark/Iron Man. Michael Giachinno's score is excellent as always and the action sequences are your typical web-slinger fair. Michael Keaton is probably the stand-out newcomer in the movie who delivers the most effective portrayal of a comic villain since Heath Ledger's legendary performance as joker, seriously, Keaton is that good. I could not recommend this movie enough to anyone looking for a good time at the theater and eagerly await Holland's return to the character in the upcoming Avengers: Infinity War.",9,3,11,16 September 2017
The Conjuring 2," A satisfyingly frightful film
","I have to admit, I wasn't The Conjuring's (2013) biggest fan. The film felt like yet another possession story that has been told in a very similar way since The Exorcist (1973). The jump scares were there and provided everyone in the theater a good spook, but the clich√© nature of the film prevented from rating it anything other than O.K. James Wan's The Conjuring 2 is very much a story told in the same way as the previous film. Ed and Lorraine Warren are once again sent on task to aid a family being haunted by a truly terrifying demon. There are far more twists and turns to this iteration in The Conjuring series than its previous entry., but the most amusing part of this film is Wan's wonderful recreation of 1970's England. The Hodgson family is in great distress by the time the Warren's arrive, and sure enough, this films demonic presence doesn't like it. What transpires is a jumpy and at times horrific demon tale that is far from original. The movie progresses very much like the first entry and the acting throughout the film is serviceable if not mediocre at times. Thankfully, Wan pulls us into the horror immediately, leaving us on pins and needles for the films surprisingly lengthy run time (2+ hours). You are definitely getting a lot of scare for your buck, which is arguably the films greatest accomplishment. Many modern horror films run under 90 minutes, so a lengthy ghost tail is a treat. While the demon possession story has been told many times, the consistently ominous tone of the film is no joke. Wan's camera-work is wonderfully traditional for a horror film, full of close ups and some well planned continuous shots. The film ends abruptly and without much resolution, its hard not to wish there was a bit more put into the concluding moments. I don't how many more of these films in The Conjuring series can be made before they are cast aside a repetitive, but as long as Wan is behind the camera, its worth giving it a try 7/10 - Good",7,0,0,30 October 2016
