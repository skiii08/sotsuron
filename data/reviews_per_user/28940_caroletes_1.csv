Catch Me If You Can," much ado about nothing
","The movie itself is ok... no big deal though.... I mean if it wasnt with hanks, dicaprio, walken, sheen and directed by spielberg, would it really be this successful?! In my opinion walken was the best actor in this movie. hanks is almost perfect in most of his movie, and dicaprio isn't that bad, but christopher walken totally steals the public's attention (at least my own). If you want something to do on a rainy day and your brain is not working very well, go check it out; otherwise go watch a classic!",6,0,2,26 February 2003
