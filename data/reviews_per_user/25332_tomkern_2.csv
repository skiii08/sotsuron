Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great scenery and story; only detraction is minor parts directed to kids and humor.
","George Lucas has created a believable galaxy of planets, cultures, and characters - at least the real human ones.  The computer generated races and characters are a bit difficult to believe though, and are obviously there somewhat to appeal to kids and sell toys.  The technology in the movie does somehow seem to be a generation behind the Star Wars trilogy, which is really amazing.  Not like going from the 90's to the 50's here when we know what that is like. Darth Maul was excellently played, though his appearance was childish. Too many horns and a lousy black and red face that could never appear naturally (colors had sharp edges, not a blending).  The light saber fights were full of energy, best yet! My only other story complaints involved Anakin Skywalker.  Who would let a little kid who had never shown any exceptional talent up to that time be a pod racer, in a big betting event.  Also how does the fighter he's in at the end have autopilot set to the battleship when the Naboos just broke into the hangar?  And who hires the engineers who design those ships that you can fly into them and blow up a critical component with a small weapon, thus destroying a giant ship.  George Lucas should have used that trick only once in Star Wars.  But we saw it again (very easy destruction of the Death Star) in Return of the Jedi, and here again in Episode 1. Also could the characters occasionally show fear in a battle.  I can see the Jedi remaining calm, but an untrained small boy who is not in touch with the Force?!",9,0,0,23 June 1999
Aliens," Great action, tense scenes, but some logic missing
","I could tell you all the great things I like about this movie, which there are many.  The one main thing that always troubles me is that the end of the movie is written illogically just to keep it going.  My point: Ripley goes back to rescue the lone survivor - a little girl.  She kills a few aliens and then frees the girl.  As Ripley's about to leave she notices she's right next to the alien nursery and that a giant queen alien is suspended from the ceiling.  Meanwhile the damaged nuclear reactor is to explode in a few minutes and destroy everything in miles.  Instead of just leaving or killing the main threat - the queen - Ripley fires all her ammo and grenades at the eggs.  The queen then chases her and the battle resumes on the ship - duh, duh, duh ...",Null,0,0,18 June 1999
