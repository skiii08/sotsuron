Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Root of Dark Side
","In this episode, we can see both the growth and the root of dark side of Anakin. He takes part with his mother to training under Kwai Gan Jin. Through the adventure with Jedies, he grows, but the parting with his mother and the encounter of Padme become the root of his dark side. And it becomes his weakness. Also, Obi Wan is supposed to grow because of the death of his master. He cannot relies on master, ant the time comes when he has to becomes independent.By the way, this movie (Star Wars series) always brings unique villains. Their appearances, the ways of fighting, and characters are differ from each one. I think this is because not only attract audience, but also make the hardships for Jedies. This time, the villain's appearance is scary and his fighting strength is also powerful. I watched this movie when I was a child, but I like it so I watch it still now.",7,3,3,25 July 2016
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The Double Meaning of robots
","I think this movie reflects the future of modern society. Computer technology grows more and more these days, and this is improvement of society. However, if we keep on evolving technology, what is going to be happen is described in this film. So this movie is a kind of SF, but it is not just a SF. It includes real future, and therefore we have much to learn. One thing I learned from this movie is, we cannot change the past but can change the future. In the movie, the robot comes from future to save the boy. This cannot be happened in the real world, but this action based on thought that do everything to change the future. The first time I watched this movie was my childhood, so I could have not understand those past-future changes. However, the more older I become, I come to consider this idea. By the way,this film focuses on the bond of human and robot, too. The boy grows with robot, undergoing many troubles. And I see the good point and bad point from this. If we keep on developing robot, it will take charge. But if we contact with robot with heart, they reply. So this movie describes double meaning of the robot.",8,1,2,16 June 2016
Enchanted," Different from other princess true love
","This film is different from other Disney's princess movies in many points. First of all, it is constructed from animation and real picture. What is more interesting is that at the end of the movie, some characters live in different world. The animation character lives in real life, and the real world's character lives in animation world. Second, the characters in this film fins out what is their true love. The important point is, not only the lead character but also the others around her finally realize their true loves. It is not romantic like other princess's stories, a kind of the love of princess and prince. However, it brings sympathy to audience. Third, the princess's character is typical of a princess in the beginning,(for example, she can talk with animals, and she likes t sing) but she learns many things in the real life and grows gradually. And this growth lets her realize her true love. One of the elements I like in this movie is it includes many songs. It is like a musical somehow, and music gives us a great impact. This movie's main theme is love, but is concludes humor and family love, so everyone can enjoy this film.",8,1,1,15 June 2016
Mamma Mia!," Good music and Views
","The first reason that I like this movie is I like ABBA. We can enjoy not only watching the screen but also hearing the songs. The song's themes are match to every scene, and we can see the actor's operations along the songs. Also, the view of this movie is very beautiful. And the scene 'Slipping to my Fingers' is the most moving, because we can see the relationship of mother and daughter. And we are supposed to consider the relationship of father and daughter. However, the content of this film is conventional. I could imagine what will happen next. There is no surprise. So I think this is the only weak point of this movie. But I like the music of this movie, so I can watch it again and again.",7,0,1,25 July 2016
Toy Story," Approving each other
","I watched this movie when I was an elementary student for the first time. That time, I only thought that toys are cute, or something like that. However, this film contains moral meaning, and I have not realize it until I become an adult. This film tells us the importance of things. These days, people have many things. It means we are rich. However, it's only the abundance of objective things. In toy story, a boy with many toys but does not have heart to treat toys dearly is suppose to be punished. This suggests the situation of modern society, and reminds us the importance to treat things carefully. Another point that I like in this film is, the growth of the cowboy. When he meets Buzz for the first time, he did not accept Buzz, because he couldn't understand everything about Buzz. Moreover, his position was taken over because of Buzz's appearance. However, he learns the importance of understanding other people, through the adventure to return to home. Also, Buzz finally comes to understand Woody. This means that we can understand each other even if the existence is in contrast.",9,0,1,4 July 2016
Alice in Wonderland," Fantastic characters, images, and world view
","First of all, I like the beautiful images of this movie. It makes audience think as if we are in the wonderland with Alice. And unique characters are described real, especially the mad hatter. He is always mad, but he has dark past and therefore sometimes looks like another person. And the lead character, Alice, is going to bother about her identity. At first, she becomes cowardly because everyone says she is not a real Alice. However, she comes to try overcoming it and becomes strong and brave gradually. The figure braves me. Finally, she returns to real world, and decides to live her way. The will is made through the adventure in the wonderland. It is strange because she fight at the wonderland, not real world, however when she returns, she overcome the weakness. Anyway, I like the world view of this film.",6,0,0,23 July 2016
Toy Story 2," Woody chooses friendship
","In Toy Story 2, Woody's conflict is described centrally. It means go back to home, or become the exhibit. Both ways include the way that he lives as toy. Such cross board sometimes occurs in our real life, though the world ( toy's imaginary world, or our real world) is different. Therefore, we can watch this film as if we were in Woody's situation. Moreover, he meets new friends and the friend's existence assists him to bother more, which way to take. Finally he decides to return to home, and this suggests the importance of friends. Going back to home means that Woody will live along Andy. And someday this life is going to end, because Andy will not play with toys forever. On the contrary, if Woody had gone to a museum, he can live as toy forever. But he chooses to live with Andy. One reason is of course he loves Andy, but there is another reason. He has friends at home, and if he did not have such friends, his choose might different from this film.",9,0,1,4 July 2016
Toy Story 3," Cannot see without crying
","When I watched this movie for the first time, I cried because the ending is so moving. In Toy Story 3, we can see the conflict of Andy, though till now toys are in the center of this series. This time(in 3) I made to consider , what is toy? And this film reminds me of the past toys that I used to play with in my childhood. Some were abandoned, and some are still exist as toy. But abandoned toys still live in my heart, and it is the true meaning of toys. In this film, toys are passed to another child, so Andy takes part with them. But Andy must remember them somewhere in his heart, like me. And this means toys live along our life. When we become adult, almost all toys are abandoned, but it does not mean that we don not like them. It just means toy's place shifts to our heart from real existence. Moreover, the bad bear character has impressed me a lot, because the reason he becomes evil suggests the problem of modern society. It has much to consider for me.",9,0,1,20 July 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Love Star Wars
","First of all, I love Star Wars series because it is not SF, but it describes the family relation and the problem of virtue and evil. The background is imaginary, but we have the same problem as its core theme. In Star Wars episode VII , many people discuss mainly 'who is Ray? ' And I think she describes the figure of every girls live this modern society. She is asked ' Who are you?'by everyone, and also ask herself the same way. She cannot sure her identity, but she has strong mental power to live through life. This implies the way girls live their life . Moreover, Kylo Ren's inner weakness suggests human's weakness. His appearance seems to be very strong and evil, however, his true figure is very fragile. He cannot establish his existence and seems to have bemusement about which he belongs, 'virtue or evil?'. Such conflict often occurs when we live life. Anyway, I cannot wait the sequel.",8,0,14,20 July 2016
