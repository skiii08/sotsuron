Who Framed Roger Rabbit," The dip is terrible
","I morally hated how Judge Doom subjected a cute little toon shoe to that liquid! If it made an ugly noise, fine. Eddie was sure a tough, but decent hero who saved Roger from this fate and Toontown from Armageddon. I can't stand to see Woody Woodpecker, Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny, Daffy and Donald Duck, Betty Bo, Goofy, Pinnochio, Tinker Bell, Yosemite Sam, Elmer, Porky Pig, Pluto, Pooh, Baby Herman, Jessica or especially Roger get destroyed by the dip. I am sure glad Doom was destroyed by that dip. He was the worst villain to conceal his identity as a toon. If toons in our world came to life and attacked everyone for no reason, I'd unleash my secret weapon: iron, a special armor that toons can use to protect themselves against the dip!",8,0,2,22 November 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," This is a deadly drama!
","This one is UNLIKE any of the Star Wars movies I've ever seen in my entire life! I mean it was HORRIFYING to watch Anakin (or Darth Vader) getting scorched and badly screaming for mercy! And the way he shouted 'I HATE YOU!' was extremely gross! This left me shaking and wimpering in shock because I learned that Palpatine was the sickest and most elusive villain in the universe! I like Episode VI better than Episode III because here, Anakin turns from the dark side and saves his son from his former master and former ally! Palpatine's plot to rid the galaxy of the Jedi and treat innocent citizens like garbage was the worst in the world! BEWARE! This film might make you throw up!! However, congratulations to George Lucas for completing the Star Wars saga for us! 2 thumbs up!",4,1,3,23 October 2006
Toy Story 3," Nobody expect a Toy Story 4!
","This is the best of the 3 in the Toy Story trilogy. It has plenty of laughs and, as destined, Andy is leaving for college. The beginning was nostalgic with the old wallpaper at Andy's old room. In the movie, there are plenty of new toys to meet. Too bad Bo Peep, Mr. Spell and Mike are omitted from the movie. I always loved Bo Peep, but Jesse or Bo for Woody is your pick. Of the antagonists in Toy Story, Sid, I hope, is no longer into torturing toys just for fun. Prospector Stinky Pete was charming at first, but was really stinky in his soul and Lotso I would only like as a cuddly toy, as he is tyrannical in the toy life.Heartwarming conclusion to a heartwarming trilogy.",9,1,1,26 December 2010
