10 Cloverfield Lane," Excellent thriller
","I really enjoyed this movie. My friend was disappointed that it wasn't a monster movie like the first. I understand that. I tried to point out that despite this, it was an excellent thriller. I do agree that the ending should have been different. Try to watch with an open mind.",7,1,2,26 May 2019
Cloverfield," Pretty good
","This movie isn't as bad as a lot of the reviews say it is. The acting is good. There weren't many big names which is fine. I am torn between the decision of going to save Beth and leaving her. Rob still loves her, so I get that. But you aren't sure that she is still alive, so why not just leave the city. The visuals are excellent. I love the fact that we don't know what the creature actually is. It reminds me of some zombie movies. We don't need an explanation. Overall it is a pretty good movie.",7,1,1,26 May 2019
Alien vs. Predator," Not terrible
","I can still remember the first time I saw this in the theater and thought it was great. That mostly holds true. The story is mediocre, but the action is awesome. The Aliens and Predators look fantastic. (Plus the fact that they were still mostly portrayed by actors in suits earns brownie points.) Not as great as the other movies, but still worth watching.",7,0,0,11 May 2019
Prometheus," Very Good
","I loved this movie. It's my third favorite Alien movie after the first two. I'm glad that Ridley Scott returned to the franchise. Although they focused more on the Engineers, I wasn't disappointed in that fact. The goal was to do something different. That's probably why some didn't like it. But it's definitely worth watching.",8,1,2,11 May 2019
Alien: Covenant," Pretty Good
","This movie may have similarities to Alien, but is still a worthy addition to the franchise. Although it would have been interesting to see where Ridley originally wanted to go after Prometheus, doesn't mean this movie should be missed. I hope that he decides to finish his prequel trilogy. Looking forward to how he ties it into Alien.",7,1,1,11 May 2019
