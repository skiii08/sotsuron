First Man," Very Disappointed
",This movie is tedious and melodramatic. The audio quality of the radio chatter is unintelligible. The human relationships are one dimensional. The special effects feel like they were shot inside of a 1950s vintage tilt-a-whirl amusement park ride. And what's with all the dirt and grime on the knobs and bulkheads inside what were supposed to be brand new (at the time) space capsules? The memory of Neil Armstrong deserves better -- way better.,1,84,148,18 October 2018
