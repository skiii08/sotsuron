Blade Runner 2049," PAH !! (to the naysayers)
","Pah! To the naysayers. I didn't know what to feel coming out of this film the other day. All I do know is I want to see it again and soon. I think if you love the original BR then its going to take a little time for this to sink into the old noggin. It has definitely taken me a few days for this to sink in. There is A LOT going on in this sequel, its posing some very big questions about 'The Singularity' (its coming people), and being human. These are two different films with an overlapping narrative. The art direction and sets are mind blowing in the sequel, I still cant get many of those overhead shots out of my head. We will have replicants, they are coming so films of this nature, (Ex Machina, The Machine, Humans are almost needed. We need to get used to the idea.... Everyone needs to use their minds eyes and reimagine the film and the more stunning sequences. This is exceptional filmaking.Personally I think we will travel the stars in lab pods in the form of reconstitutional DNA strands. Manning those pods will be 'replicants' who will find the Goldilocks planets and then reconstitute us. The replicants will look after us on the new planets until we can fend for ourselves. This is how we will galactically travel.",9,1,7,17 October 2017
The King," STELLAR, Please watch this
","Fabulous film making It can be said its not Shakespeare or correct history, but from my research the history isnt far off.
What is outstanding are the production values THE ACTING ! , lighting, direction, script , locations - its all excellent.
The reason this film was made is Joel Edgerton realized that this part of European history is about as important as any in history, and defines the English.
Its a great story.
The English crown was anyone's for nearly 400 years starting with William 1st (1066).
When Henrys' new wife Catherine says 'we are all usurpers' it was true. The crown was up for grabs particularly in England.
Please see this, it doesnt drag, it is more like a slow burn.",10,6,11,3 November 2019
