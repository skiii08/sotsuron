The Ring," Not as good as the original
","if you're thinking of seeing this because you like scary movies, my advice is see the japanese original first.  having said that, once you see the original, chances are you wont like this one. I've seen the original trilogy so kind of knew what to expect so the creepiness wasnt there for me.  thankfully though this wasnt ruined by many OTT special fx like other Hollywood remakes have been.I wouldnt say this was a bad movie, I just wouldnt recommend it if you've seen the original.",Null,0,0,31 December 2002
