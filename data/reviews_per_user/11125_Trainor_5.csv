The Blair Witch Project," An instant classic
","If you are looking for eye-popping special effects, million dollar car chases, or oscar worthy performances then this is not the movie for you.  If you are looking for originality, realism, or a truly gripping story line then go see 'The Blair Witch Project.'  This movie is completely different then any movie I have seen that was made in the past three decades.  The way that the movie allowed me to understand the characters, and understand that they were not very unlike myself allowed myself to pulled deep into the story as it developed in front of me.  I didn't realize how much I was into the movie until it started to build so much that I found my heart pounding even when nothing was currently happening.  It was like being on a train that was speeding up and there was nowhere I could go.  Years from now people will be talking about this movie for it is truly an instant classic",10,2,4,2 August 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Hilarious if you can see past the offensiveness
","I must start off by warning parents and anyone who is offended easily that this movie earns it's R rating and then some.  There were a few times during the movie where I think that they may have gone a little too far, even for a die hard fan like myself.  However, no matter how offensive the movie got it was able to only have me rolling in the floors but also made some very valid points.  It was also refreshing to see a short animated show taken to a full length feature film without loosing any of the shows charm.  Overall, it was a very entertaining film that truly shows the creators wit and style.",7,2,2,6 July 1999
The Mummy," Great special effects, average movie
","I went in to this movie expecting a blockbuster, and that may have been what caused its downfall from my view.  The special effects were exactly what I was expecting if not more, keeping me enthralled and allowing me to ignore the gaps in the plot. It was obvious to me that more time was spent on the special effects then on any other aspect of this film.  Even with it's downfalls this film was an average movie without the special effects which makes it above average for the total package. I would recomend this as a movie to see, if only for the effects.",6,0,0,9 June 1999
The Patriot," Finally, A summer blockbuster worth the hype
","I went to see The Patriot this weekend with mixed emotions.  I am a fan of Mel Gibson and his work in the past and was intrigued by the previews but at the same time I was conflicted by some of the negative comments regarding this movie.  After seeing the movie I feel that I can address the comments as well as assure you that this is one of the top 50 movies of all time. The imagery was amazing, the acting was wonderful, and the story was moving. I fully enjoyed every minute of the movie and did not feel any effects of sitting down for such a long time.I want to address some of the criticisms of this movie.  1. It is an inaccurate portrayal of history.  Answer:  This is a movie not a documentary, it is meant for entertainment purposes only and if you go to the movies to learn the facts about history then that is a whole different problem.  2.  It portrays a disgusting and violent man as a hero.  Answer: Benjamin Martin is based on several characters and despite being the hero of the movie they do make a point of showing that several of his deeds are very morbid and appalling, even to his own family.  3.  This movie is too similar to Braveheart.  Answer:  Yes, this movie is an amazing epic, Mel Gibson is the star, and there are some similar generic plot aspects (revolting against tyranny, revenge for loved ones) but I didn't see any one running around in kilts and I'm pretty sure it took place in a different time and place.The bottom line here is that if you worry too much about the silly criticisms trying to make this movie into something more then you are going to miss out on one of the best movies of all time.  This is a must see and I for one will be seeing it again.",10,0,2,5 July 2000
Gladiator," Lions, and Romans, and Gladiators, Oh my!
","I have to admit that I was one of the few who were not totally anticipating this release.  I am a die-hard Braveheart fan and have been disappointed by all epics since it's release.  Although this movie is still no Braveheart in my opinion, it is definitely a movie to see.  The beginning fight scene along with some of the shots of Rome shows why this movie is truly an epic. The total grandeur of the picture along with some excellent acting help make this movie one of the top 100 of all time despite some obvious slow points in the plot.  This movie clearly could have been 3+ hours had they fully developed the main characters and the plot.  The special effects are blended in nicely without taking away from the movie and it's realism.  One of Russell Crowe's best works if not the best of his career.  I highly suggest viewing this movie on the big screen.",8,0,0,8 May 2000
