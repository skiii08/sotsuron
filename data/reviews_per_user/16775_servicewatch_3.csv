The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," I found an interesting take on The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1
","I found an interesting take on The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 here:http://4thdimensionfilms.wordpress.com/Once upon a time, Hollywood made movies intended to be seen in one sitting usually lasting 90 minutes or so.You told a story with a beginning, a middle and an end—voilà, there's your movie.But toward the end of the 20th century when executives decided to establish the sequel as the preferred business model in the American film industry—and theoretically ensure a stream of income lasting years if not decades—brevity no longer equaled bankroll and all bets were off.So it comes as no surprise that the fourth release from the Twilight machine, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1, should once again prove to be a huge maybe even record-breaking commercial success.By some estimates, the Twilight film franchise has already earned nearly $2 billion to date—equal to the entire GDP of some foreign countries.But just why do films like The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 reap huge box office receipts over and over again?",Null,8,33,17 November 2011
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Swedish version is much better
",I came across an interesting review of the Swedish version of 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' here: http://4thdimensionfilms.wordpress.com/ The Swedish version is less annoying than the American version which unfortunately is formulaic. The review I read is spot on in reviewing character analysis and other artistic aspects. The American Dragon will undoubtedly appeal to newbies to the trilogy or those who don't like the pacing of foreign films. Still the Swedish original is usually the best place to start and the review that I suggest could get many more people interested in bothering to see the American version or even get people to take another look at European and other foreign films which are currently experiencing a renaissance. This will provide a good synopsis: http://4thdimensionfilms.wordpress.com/,5,11,25,25 December 2011
The Artist," Artists satisfies but it's still overrated
","I read an interesting take on The Artist here: http://4thdimensionfilms.wordpress.com/When I first saw 'The Artist,' I couldn't quite make out whether this film was a gimmicky effort made to appeal to a niche segment of cinephiles or a finely crafted homage to the silent era.Directed by the relatively unknown Michel Hazanavicius, 'Artist' (2011) has garnered glowing critical review including three Oscar nominations for Hazanavicius: best director, best original screenplay and best editing.Despite that, 'Artist' is still not in the same league as its cinematic ancestors: 'The Passion of Joan of Arc' (Carl Theodor Dreyer, 1928), 'The Battleship Potemkin' (Sergei M. Eisenstein, 1925), 'Greed' (Erich Von Stroheim, 1924), 'The General' (Buster Keaton, 1926) and 'Metropolis' (Fritz Lang, 1927) are just a handful of films from that era that should, at the very least, receive a special screening by the academy prior to handing out any statuette for 'Artist.'",8,0,5,25 February 2012
