The Blair Witch Project," Haven't you ever been to camp?
","This movie scared me in a way that no other has done before.  I remember going to camp as a child, and hearing things outside at night.  That was scary enough.  This movie recreated that entire scenario and then added some to it.  The fact that those things that go bump in the night outside your campsite were REAL in this movie makes it more nerve-inducing and frightening.  As anyone, the first time I set foot in the ocean after seeing JAWS for the first time, I was nervous.  Let me tell you in order to get from the movie theater to my house, I have to drive through the woods. After seeing this movie, that drive got SIGNIFICANTLY longer, more eerie, and scared the heck out of me.  I went about 90 mph all the way home in order to get out of the woods!  This is one SCARY movie.",Null,122,206,2 February 2000
