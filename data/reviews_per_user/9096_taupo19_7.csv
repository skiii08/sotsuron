The Double Life of Véronique," It's rare I walk away
","I hated this movie from the get go. The artificiality of the characters the silly dream like atmosphere. The production design immediately irritated me.From the very first scene!The fake singing voice - the green/red lighting - the shallow characterisation - I'm so sick of unbelievably beautiful woman, perfect faces, perfect bodies, perfect make up. They wake up looking beautiful - never fail to have a beautiful mutual orgasm with a gorgeous lover. Yuk, yuk,yuk, yuk YUK!Last night we watched 'A separation' (Iranian) which was astounding<ul><li>watch that, bin this</li></ul>",2,8,17,18 January 2012
The Hangover," Probably the 3rd worse movie I've ever seen
",Considering the hype and 4 star reviews I went to this movie hoping for something more then a remake of Swingers and more adult then the endless juvenile 'we're going to swear and talk about gay things to shock the audience' movies that seem to be prolific at the moment - I can honestly say I didn't smile once during the whole movie - and I loved Swingers! Getting embarrassed over a breast feeding Mother and an elderly patients butt - Oh please! Hollywood needs to grow up - they were making movies like this when I was in my teens (Porky's) - get your noses out of your school boy fantasies and try and make a decent movie next time will you? Something with a little wit and intelligence if you don't mind.,1,32,64,19 June 2009
Star Trek Into Darkness," Nothing new - cliché, cliché, cliché
","to begin with I enjoyed the previous movie - it was fresh, well done and the characters played perfectly. Fine, I sat with anticipation hoping the latest instalment would leave me as thrilled as the last one. Having watched the promos I was expecting ruin to be rained down upon the earth by a vengeful Cumberbatch with Kirk and his crew saving the world after a terrible battle. What we got instead was a clichéd mix of set pieces seen a thousand times before dressed up in some very impressive special effects. First Cumberbatch is evil incarnate, then he a good guy who saves Kirk and Co. from the Klingons - then he's on the good guy's side, no wait! It's a clever trick, then he's a baddie again. Hanging by one hand from falling platform? check, being rescued from said situation by a one handed grab, check and in fact check again. Big punch up on moving platform, check and check again. Baddies who always miss and goodies who never miss, check. This movie was one of the few where my score dropped the longer I watched. the first quarter? Hmmmm, not bad 7/10. The middle part - whoops maybe not so great - 6/10. The 3rd quarter - not really enjoying this any more - 5/10... The last quarter, with the Spock fist fight and Jim being revived - should have ended up on the editing room floor.. 4/10 I can't believe this movie scored so highly on IMDb.

Horrible Bosses," terrible movie - thank God I didn't pay to see it.
","Got to see this as a free preview - had no expectations - for some reason thought it might be good. From the get go it was terrible. The characters were empty stereotypes - the plot ridiculous - the humour vacuous - for god sake, can they really not produce some better? All the stereotypes were out in force. There was the executives - all white. Their beautiful wives/babes/babe-courier, all white - the token black in the roughest bar in town - all black. The car auto pilot (taxi driver) Asian.The only humour was slapstick and bad slapstick - sticking someone's toothbrush up your arse to reek revenge typical. The 'shock' elements were women saying dirty words out loud - wow. Ground breaking.Don't waste your money, tooth enamel on this movie - go outside dig a hole, and then fill it in. A far better use of your time.",1,128,279,12 July 2011
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Indiana Hobbit
","I am a Tolkien fan having read LOTRs and The Hobbit many times (over 20). I loved Peter Jackson's LOTRs trilogy despite his skateboarding Legolas and slapstick version of Gimli. Gollum was one of the greatest characterisations I have ever seen.So full marks for The Hobbit then? No - not at all.The pre-release posters gave a strong hint of what was to come. The Hobbit is a childs book but the lighting on the posters was like something out of Gone With The Wind. Uh-oh, I thought. Jackson's gone epic.To begin with think Martin Freeman was a mistake. He does a great job at being Martin Freeman the Hobbit - but he just isn't Bilbo. The dwarfs a pretty good but they don't really come over as grim tough fighting types. More like comic stuntmen. Was it really necessary to 'personality' them up to that extent? Thank God that Del Toro didn't get his steam punk way so I will forgive Jackson for things like axes sticking out of heads and Thorin's 'I just come from the hairdressers' look. The Hobbit book is funny but for me the humour in Jackson's version just doesn't match the tone of the movie. A bit like all the Gimli jokes in the LOTR. It's just out of place. The special effects are terrific with Gollum the star again. - but there's too many of them necessitated by Jacksons need to 'big' everything up. Hollywood pressure? The dishwashing scene could have been done with clever camera work and loads of unbreakable dishes instead Jackson felt the need to turn it into a football trick session with the CGI obvious. There was no tension to the scene as we all knew the dishes weren't real. Small effects also seemed hamfisted. Bilbo running to catch the dwarfs seemed to be wearing swimming flippers instead of Hobbit feet. I don't ever remember thinking that in LOTR. Why oh why must there always be sliding scenes ala Spielberg. There have been three already. And the done to death ' grab on by one hand and amazingly pull someone to safety' stunt. I'm not sure Jackson has an original bone in his directing body. Everything in the movie I've seen a thousand times before. I guess my biggest complaint against the movie is the starring of characters that have almost no part in the book. Talking Radagast the Brown and the Pale Ork here. Ridiculously overplayed and turned me from a Jackson fan to a Jackson doubter. Was it really necessary to have completely new characters in the film? Only if there's a need to increase the drama - a need to add special effects to appeal to an audience used to seeing explosions and chases and baddies. And why oh why did the head goblin have a posh accent? For God sake. I could go on - the Troll who was feminine - Galadriel turning on some kind of potters wheel and almost falling over her spiralling dress. The sledge race - and so on and so on. When you think about it Jackson hasn't made a great movie since LOTRs. King Kong was awful, Lovely Bones a flop - The critics don't like the Hobbit - look at the Meta score and I agree. I'm not so sure he's anything more then a average director carried along by his success with LOTR. Which is disappointing, 'cause he's a Kiwi - like me. Final verdict? Could do so much better (I hope)",6,3,6,12 July 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy," Anyone who gave this over 5 stars is wrong
","I went into this movie'with high hopes. I'd seen positive reviews and heard it favourably compared with Serenity - a particularly favourite of mine. I left the cinema bored and irritated. This film was so derivative, frankly I'm surprised that anyone gave it more than 5 stars. Opening scene? Indiana Jones and the lost Ark. Badies? A leather clad Darth Vader with runny mascara. Emperor? Check. Secret about the father? Check.People have said that they felt the characters were fleshed out.. Are you out of your minds? 'I lost my mother'. 'Really? I lost my wife and child' 'That's nothing. I was cut up and put back together so many times AND I was bullied'. 'Well I used to be a shrub and was transplanted without permission'. The special affects were massive and continuous and - in the end dulled the senses. There was the inevitable Ninja babe and cutesy furry character. No one meaningful died apart from Darth who got fried in blue fire.. why he didn't just grab on and share the magic I don't know. Lastly there was no sense of tension. We all knew that the goodies were going to survive. There's a sequel to make right? I could go on and on but I won't. I went to see this in hope. I won't be seeing the next one unless Joss Whedon is put in charge. Sigh another wasted two hours of my life.",3,61,123,14 September 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," Poor, poor, Mr Nolan
","I went into the cinema with heightened expectations. I'd enjoyed the previous two Nolan efforts and was impressed with the Knight rises trailer. Here we go, I thought, more of the same but even better. How wrong I was. First hour - lots of talking, nothing wrong with that - setting the scene - sit tight, wait for the fun to start. Little things started to niggle. The fight scenes seemed artificial - badly choreographed. Nolan seemed to want to bring Batman out into the daylight and turn him into a brawler with the baddies running up one at a time to be hit.I thought Bane was an excellent Baddie, ruthless, strong, intelligent. The Plot was fine - the other characters sufficient - the devil for me was in the detail.Gotham was in lock-down for how long? The cops were trapped underground for - months was it? Weeks anyway. They came out of there hole looking shiny and new. Blake's partner emerges with his shaven head perfectly razor-ed - Did anyone else notice the hair? Everybody had a perfect haircut the entire length length of the movie.I think the biggest disappointment for me was the lack of tension. Batman was going to survive, Catwoman was going to save Batman, the bomb was going to be made safe - Bruce Wayne would see another film made etc. etc. With comic book film franchises I suppose this inevitable but the way Nolan went about it was arse numbingly tedious.Nolan - go and stand in the corner with Lucas and Cameron - Damn it! Another £15 wasted.",5,3,10,25 July 2012
