Hereditary," Too sober to watch
","If you already bought tickets for this then bring alcohol with you belive me you'll need it for those last 7 minutes. 
Basically not much happens in those 2hrs sometimes it gets more jumpy with a hint of that horror movie you came to watch (I hate horror movies so if you love them you'll be bored) sometimes it's quite disgusting like when Charlie gets beheaded but it sort of builds up leading to those last 7 minutes and you're starting to think like 'oh my god it's coming finally the moment I'll pee my pants from sheer horror' and then suddenly there is a overweight naked man standing in the closet happily smiling with this slight little wave, that was the moment when the whole cinema went off with horrendous laugh it was just plain stupid and from then on it gets just worse and worse until you are just sitting in your seat and staring at the end titles passing by and thinking what the hell was that, what on earth I've just seen and after that you'll start to question your intelligence...
I mean actors are playing really well for what they were given the music is good too it's the script that is 'shajt' 
I really wish I could get those 2+ hours refunded I want them back!!!",1,0,4,28 August 2018
