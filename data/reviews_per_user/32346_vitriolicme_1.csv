Requiem for a Dream," My favorite film!
","This film has been my favorite film since I first viewed it, what seems like many years ago now. It's one I have sat my friends through and made them watch and it's one that doesn't fail to impress them. Requiem For A Dream is hard to dissect because it's the whole work that is faultless for me. I couldn't imagine it without the music it has, or without the cast it has, as all of these elements make it the stand up film it is. It's a real, gritty, moving, haunting film. And if purchased I would fully recommend watching the extras the DVD contains as it will make you notice the subtle details more and appreciate it even more, knowing the thought that went into how it looked. The lighting changes with the seasons to mirror the characters live's. I since tried to view Pi many a time but unfortunately never enjoyed it and struggled to watch it. Requiem is a piece of art and though perhaps I shouldn't feel this way, I feel having read the book, that the book has no impact compared to Darren's portrayal. It's a hard watch because it can be incredibly depressing at times, but I think that it almost makes it more worth watching as it is a movie that will make you think. After I watched it the first thing I did was choose to write an essay about it. It makes you want to get people to watch it and gauge their reactions.",10,1,2,21 January 2008
