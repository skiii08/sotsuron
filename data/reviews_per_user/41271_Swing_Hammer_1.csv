Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Worst piece of tripe I've ever seen
","Can't say enough bad things about this movie. I came out of the cinema after yawning all the way thru bored and angry that I got sucked into forking out $2.50. Never before have I seen so many weak elements combined into one movie. I have talked to apparently intelligent people about this movie and the only common factor I can find is they were all hooked on the original Star Wars thing. Which only proves the old biblical proverb, 'get em while they're young'...",1,21,41,15 March 2002
