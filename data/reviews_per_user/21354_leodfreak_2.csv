Catch Me If You Can," Was Great!!
","Okay...Leonardo DiCaprio (Frank Abagnale Jr.) did great - so was Tom Hanks. They both did a good job even though it's a true story.But wow! It does not seem real at all. I mean, the real Frank Abagnale Jr. had been going through all that lying and faking checks. And then got caught and had been sentenced in prison for 25 years. I thought it was going to be for life. But let's get onto the movie. Well, the movie was great. The plot was good and everything else. I'd have to rate this movie a 9 out of 10. Great job!! :)",Null,0,1,17 June 2003
Titanic," I like it!!
","Ever since I heard the movie, Titanic out in theaters, I thought that the movie was boring. So I searched it up on the computer and it was based on a real-life story. I haven't had the time to see Titanic in theaters, so I waited for it to come out on video. I heard that it came out in near mid-September so I put the Titanic movie in my wishlist for Christmas and I got it!! I watched it and I felt so into it. I'm romantic so anything with kissing will do. Don't call me nasty but that's how I am. I have watched that movie more than 50 times, I'm sure. Also..Leonardo DiCaprio is my favorite actor so he was really good in that movie. I loved that movie till now and I have searched up Titanic to learn the old times of what 'really happened.' The special effects were really fantastic. I really enjoyed that. Also, the music was the best thing out of the movie!! I love the Titanic music. It's so soft and relaxing, in my point of view! Right now since I have been watching it...a 2 or 2Â½ hours long..I know the words to the movie!I admire that movie a lot. I feel like I am in that event that happened and the Titanic sank when I was on it! It was so olden days!!!I still love that movie even though it came out in 1997. It is still the top best-most-expensive movie ever made!",Null,2,3,12 November 2002
