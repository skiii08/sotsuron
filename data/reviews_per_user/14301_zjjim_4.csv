Captain Phillips," Only a 50% good movie
","Actually the first 40mins of this movie is fantastic,which talks about the captain,the crew and the pirates.It is tense and Tom Hanks's performances are brilliant.Also the score is another shining part of it.However,after Captain Phillips got into the boat,everything changed and the screenplay has almost lost the basic logical sense.For example,how could the rescuers not distinguish the two persons who jumped off the boat after the pirates gave several shots at them?It was so apparent that Captain Phillips was among them and if they took actions immediately,the story would have been over much sooner.As a result,Tom Hanks didn't have any chances to show his acting skills after getting into the boat.On the contrary,the pirates were just screaming and acting foolish which just led to the situation that the last 50% of this movie has turned to a long wasting-time show which makes no sense and in my opinion,the two actors don't deserve the SAG+GG nominations at all.Hope that Leo DiCaprio can be on the list.",7,0,1,19 December 2013
Prisoners," A little disappointed
","The whole 'Crime:In the name of Love' story is not that attractive due to the mass editing problems,some scenes seem to be a little strange without any logic senses.The director has tried so hard to show the story with two parts including the Dovers and the Detective,but also failed to dig the real meaning from it,about crime,about faith,about love and belief.The whole frame of the story is so vacuous that everything seems to be unreal,so are the performances.To be frank,Hugh Jackman has given us a convincing father who has suffered a lot,but some of his behaviors still remain incomprehensible.Jake is awesome as a police detective,but I'm not sure if he can get another Supporting Actor nomination.Oscar winner Melissa Leo has shocked me indeed.",7,6,9,16 November 2013
Saving Mr. Banks," Emma Thompson is AMAZING！！！
","Having seen so many roles which Emma Thompson has played in Horwards End,Sense and Sensibility,In the Name Of the Father,but this one is quite shocking and brilliant.We may really see the annoying role Miss P.L.Travers in Emma Thompson who is so mean and unaccessible but in the other hand,has a miserable childhood.The movie starts with an amusing atmosphere but ends up with crying emotions which really touches the audiences--seeing Travers sitting in the cinema crying will remind us of our own parents.The two lines of this movies concern the current life and the past one which sometimes will make the whole movie fall apart,but thanks to the great connections between them and the marvelous performances by Emma Thompson,Saving Mr.Banks is still a great movie which will make us laugh and cry at the same time.Looking forward to seeing Emma's appearance in the Awards Season.Let's welcome the two-time former Oscar winner back after so many years with such an incredible performance.",8,1,3,29 December 2013
Thor: The Dark World," Very Funny but not a perfect one
","Seems that Loki is so popular these days that each girl will be screaming about him when watching the movie,which makes Natalie Portman invisible and unimportant. The lines in it are very funny with great humor,visual effect is also fantastic. However,it remains a big problem that the descriptions of each role are not convincing enough for us to understand what they are thinking about or planning to do.Supporting roles show us great performances which are way better than Thor and Jane,especially for Darcy and Erik. Anyway,some incredible surprises still turn up now and then.And it is way better than the first one.You shouldn't miss those excellent moments.",7,1,3,8 November 2013
