Vertigo," Good!!!
","Finally, a movie highly ranked that isn't overrated. Vertigo is a superbly suspenseful movie and entertaining movie from the master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock. It also features the timeless James Stewart, one of my all-time favorite actors. This movie is classic. Everyone should see it. bye.",8,0,1,10 August 2002
Raiders of the Lost Ark," overrated
","Indiana Jones is another good but grossly overrated movie. It's good, don't get me wrong - full of action and all that jazz, but I don't see how anyone could see it as one of the best movies ever. People probably just like it so much because it's a classic movie from when they were growing up. But i don't think it quite stands the test of time. bye.",8,1,3,10 August 2002
Casablanca," classic
","Casablanca is a real classic unlike most of those other overrated old movies. Casablanca is witty, romantic, funny, charming, suspenseful, and everything you could possibly ask for in a movie. The acting, directing, cinematography, etc. are superb. And the movie has line after line of classic dialogue, e.g. 'I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.' This is a movie for everyone to enjoy. bye.",9,0,0,10 August 2002
Minority Report," great
","Minority Report is a great futuristic sci-fi suspense action movie in the tradition of Blade Runner. The movie has an excellent plot that grabs a hold of you and won't let go until the credits roll. The acting in the movie is exquisite, the directing superb, and the cinematography extraordinary. A great movie. Everyone should see it. bye.",9,0,0,9 August 2002
Chinatown," good but not great
","Chinatown is a good movie, but it is not great. It is not one of the better film-noir movies I have seen. It is surpassed in that category by movies such L.A. Confidential, The Maltese Falcon, & Double Indemnity. All in all, a good movie, but not nearly as good as everyone makes out to be. And the ending sucks real bad. bye.",6,1,8,15 August 2002
Akira," this is one mind-blowing movie
","When I saw this movie a couple weeks ago, it absolutely blew my mind. The animation was really amazing. Seriously, Japanese people can make some damn good cartoons. The action in this movie is more exciting than in many live-action movies, such as the crappy Men In Black II. But the story is what I liked best about the movie. I thought it was a completely original, thought-provoking story and that's something I love in a movie. I love a movie that makes you think, and this particular film had my mind racing the entire time. I don't really want to ruin any of the story or anything, so I'll just say if you get the opportunity to see this movie, then see it.",9,0,1,10 July 2002
Memento," original
","This is one hella original movie. I mean, i could never make up something like this. This Nolan guy, he must be pretty smart. But anyway this movie tells the story of this guy whose wife was murdered and he's out to get her killer, but it's kinda hard since he basically has no short-term memory. Oh and the movie is told backward. You gotta see this movie just to see it. bye.",9,1,2,10 August 2002
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Okay movie
",This is an all right movie but it's not as good as people would have you believe. Sometimes I think people just like Kubrick's movies because they're just that - Kubrick's. But anyway this movie isn't all that funny or anything. But it's still not bad. It's pretty entertaining. Maybe I don't quite get it since I'm not exactly from the Cold War era and it's a big Cold War satire. oh well. bye.,8,0,2,10 August 2002
Alien," Okay
","Alien is a decent movie. It's pretty entertaining but not as scary as people would have you believe it is. If you want to see a scary movie go see the Exorcist. Or if you want to see a really good Ridley Scott movie, watch Gladiator or Black Hawk Down. bye.",6,0,5,16 August 2002
Taxi Driver," cool movie
","This is a cool movie. I think that whether we'd like to admit or not, everyone can relate to Travis Bickle. Everyone can relate to feeling isolated, angry, disillusioned. I think Travis is sweet. He did what he thought to be the right thing and that's sweet yo. bye.",7,0,3,15 August 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," is it just me or does Episode II suck worse than Episode I?
","Being a fan of the original Star Wars trilogy, when I first saw The Phantom Menace, I was disappointed, like most Star Wars fans were. Then Episode II came out and I read about it and started hearing how it's so much better than The Phantom Menace, and how Star Wars has been saved. Puh-leez! Episode II is by far the worst Star Wars movie to date. It just disgusts me. It's missing all the mysticism and the comedy, excitement, action, magic of the original trilogy, not to mention it's ten times more boring than Episode I. This has to be one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. It just drags on and on and on. It's a shame that a talented guy like George Lucas makes such crappy movies this days. He's let all these special effects capabilities he has go to his head. Episode II is all special effects and that's enough to ruin the movie right there. The original trilogy did not rely too heavily on special effects and it didn't need to because it had such a great story. The script for Episode II is a joke. George Lucas needs to start letting other people write the Star Wars scripts. The love story is so cheesy and completely lacking in the romance. The romance between Han Solo and Leia in the original trilogy was well acted and well written. But the dialogue between Padme and Anakin in this movie sounds like something out of a crappy Hallmark card. But I guess Lucas tries to make up for the crappy script by overloading the movie with special effects which just makes it seem superficial. The last 45 minutes of the movie that were supposed to be so dazzling and exciting were about as fun as watching paint try. And that Yoda fight that everyone was talking about it? It's ridiculous. Seeing a little digital Yoda running around doing flips and stuff made me laugh. In conclusion this movie sucks. bye.",3,1,2,9 August 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," the best movie ever
","The Fellowship of the Ring is the greatest movie i have ever seen. The story is really enthralling and the characters are enchanting. The movie is exquisitely directed and the cinematography is beautiful. The acting is superb. This movie delivers it all - drama, laughs, action, suspense, terror, fantasy. Hands down the best movie ever. Everyone in the universe should see this movie. bye.",10,1,1,9 August 2002
North by Northwest," underrated
","North by Northwest is a great motion picture, paving the way for future pictures such as 1993's The Fugitive. Even though it is highly ranked on IMDb (currently number 20), I still think it is underrated. It's better than most of the movies ranked ahead of it. This is a truly suspenseful action/adventure classic. Hitchcock as his best. bye.",9,0,1,10 August 2002
American Beauty," great
","American Beauty is also underrated on IMDb. It's much better than most of the movies ranked ahead of it. This movie is funny and dramatic, acted and directed exquisitely. It really makes you think too. It makes you want to be like Lester. It makes you want to just do whatever you want and not take and bullsh-t from anyone. To stand up for yourself. This is one of my most favorite movies of all time. This is great. bye.",10,0,0,10 August 2002
Being John Malkovich," Good Flick
","SPOILER Being John Malkovich is a thought-provoking, strikingly original motion picture. You gotta be on drugs or a genius to come up this stuff. It really is something else. John Cusack is a funny cat as the dorky guy. Catherine Keener is a real bitch in this movie. And Cameron Diaz is a closet lesbian. If they couldn't get John Malkovich to play himself in this movie, they would have been screwed. Oh and it's funny how John Malkovich just decides to be a puppeteer one day and then everyone in the world just loves John Malkovich and his puppeteering crap. Bye",8,0,1,10 July 2002
The Usual Suspects," overrated
","The Usual Suspects is a good movie, but in no way shape or form is it one of the greatest movies of all times. It's an interesting crime movie for pretty the entire movie. And then they throw in a cheap gimmick surprise ending, which is probably why everybody thinks it's so great. But it's not. It's good, but not great. bye.",8,1,2,10 August 2002
Saving Private Ryan," great
","Saving Private Ryan is a great movie, and in my opinion, the quintessential war movie. This is a gripping motion picture with superb acting and exquisite direction. That D-Day scene will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the greatest movie scenes ever. See this movie. bye.",9,0,0,15 August 2002
Lawrence of Arabia," overrated
",This movie is overrated too. It's long and at times pretty boring. But it's still for the most part entertaining and well acted especially by Alec Guinness. He's sweet. And the score is good. But I don't really recommend this to anyone except movie buffs. bye.,Null,3,10,10 August 2002
Schindler's List," great
","This movie is great. The acting is great, especially by Liam Neeson. Spielbeg does a great job at bringing to life the story of Oskar Schindler who went from using Jews in his factory to saving them! It's a great story. bye.",9,9,14,10 August 2002
The Elephant Man," good and underrated movie
","I thought the Elephant Man was a very good movie and I also feel that it is very underrated. It should be on more lists of great movies. This movie is a real heartbreaker. It's amazing how despite his gross deformity and the inhuman treatment he suffers, he still remains  hopeful, kind, honest, sincere, and just a great person. I think this movie is a real moral lesson to everyone out there. bye.",9,1,1,7 August 2002
Mulholland Drive," uh this movie blows
",this movie is a stupid piece of sh-t. at first it's decent when it makes some sense but in the last quarter of the film it just turns to crap and becomes a piece of incoherent filth. people probably think this is such a great movie because they dont understand it and since they dont understand it must be above and beyond them. it must be some sort of genius masterpiece. nahhh it's just some f--ked up sh-t.,Null,0,1,26 July 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," a trip
",2001: A Space Odyssey is a very boring movie. I don't think there's a single word spoken for the first 45 minutes. But this movie is visually stunning and it really makes you think. These may be its only redeeming values but that's good enough for me. bye.,8,0,6,15 August 2002
To Kill a Mockingbird," Great
","Ahhh!!! Another movie on here that actually isn't overrated. This is a superb adaptation of Harper Lee's timeless novel. It is magnificently acted, particularly by Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch, but also by the kids who play Scout and Jem. This is a really great movie and any fan of the book would appreciate it as well. Everyone should see this movie. bye.",9,0,1,10 August 2002
The Bridge on the River Kwai," good but long
","The Bridge on the River Kwai is a good movie but it's too damn long for it's own good. They could have cut a half hour out of this and it still would have been good enough. The acting in this movie is good too. Alec Guinness is my dawg and William Holden is a cool cat, daddy-o.",7,0,1,15 August 2002
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," good
","This is a good movie, but like most other movies on here, it's pretty overrated. I still liked it enough to buy it though. I think the movie is more comedic than it is dramatic. I like this whole movie except for the end, which i won't ruin. bye.",8,1,3,10 August 2002
Jaws," good for it's time
","This movie might have been a great movie back in 1975 but it just doesn't stand the test of time. It's a decently entertaining and well acted movie, but it just doesn't provide much thrills or scares, which is exactly what it's supposed to do. Therefore it's a failure. Still not a bad movie though. bye.",Null,0,1,16 August 2002
The Shawshank Redemption," superb (possible spoilers?)
","The Shawshank Redemption is a superb motion picture. The story is great. I love movies like this where you root for the underdog, in this case wrongfully convicted Andy Dufresne, skillfully played by Tim Robbins. The cunning of Dufresne is amazing, and the movie throws in a nice moral lesson on the importance of friendship. Also the directing and cinematography are great.  Everyone should see this. bye.",9,0,0,9 August 2002
The Silence of the Lambs," overrated
","Yet another overrated movie. That seems to be the theme of IMDb. Loads and loads of overrated movies filling the top 250 and great movies like The Truman Show and Dead Poets Society near the bottom. Anyway this, like most overrated movies, isn't bad. It's just overrated. It's not too suspenseful, exciting, thrilling or anything. It doesn't accomplish what it sets out to, so it's basically a failure, although it's still entertaining and well acted by Anthony Hopkins. But Jodie Foster sucks in everything she does except Taxi Driver. bye.",7,0,3,10 August 2002
The Sixth Sense," great
",The Sixth Sense is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen in my entire life. This film is absolutely magnificent. The story is great. The acting is great especially by the 11-year old Haley Joel Osment and also by Bruce Willis in a rare non-action movie role. The direction in this movie is also great. Not a single second of screen time is wasted. Everyone should see this movie. bye.,9,0,0,16 August 2002
Rear Window," another good but overrated movie
","Yes here is another good but overrated movie. I liked this movie, it was suspenseful and what not as you would expect from Hitchcock but I don't think it's one of the best movies ever, nor it is even Hitchcock's best. I'd still recommend it though. bye.",8,0,1,10 August 2002
The Matrix," Fantastic
","The Matrix is a superb motion picture on many different levels. The thing that I like most about, which is probably unlike most people, is the plot. Sure the special effects are great, and were especially spellbinding when the movie originally came out, it is the plot that I like best. It makes you think. Although it's highly unlikely, the movie could very well be true. What we perceive as the real world might not be really real after all. It's very intriguing. Also I like how the movie deals with Neo's destiny. I love when character's have a great chosen destiny for them. This is a good movie and everyone should see it. bye.",10,0,1,9 August 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Magnificent
","Star Wars is everything a science fiction movie should be and then some. This movie has got it all - action, adventure, comedy, suspense, romance. And this movie set the standard for special effects way back in 1977. But the best thing about the movie is its story. The story of an orphan loser who finds out he is destined to become a Jedi! That's sweet. Everyone should see this movie. bye.",9,0,0,10 August 2002
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," great
","The Empire Strikes Back has everything great about Star Wars and then some. It's the best Star Wars movie ever, not to mention one of the greatest movies of all time. It has all the good points of the first movie - action, suspense, comedy, romance, drama - and improves upon them with slightly better effects and a deeper and darker plotlines. Perfection attained. Everyone should see this movie. bye.",10,0,0,10 August 2002
Braveheart," GREAT
",Braveheart is a great movie. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Mel Gibson should definitely direct again. He did a great job. And this movie tells a great story of the oppressed Scots who fight for something everyone should have - freedom. Great performances across the board. Just a spectacular movie. Four stars. bye.,9,2,4,16 August 2002
Goodfellas," overrated ganster movie
","Goodfellas is an overrated gangster movie, kind of like the Godfather except it's better. The movie might be overrated but I still like it. The story is interesting, especially since it's true although I'm sure it's been quite fictionalized to make a good movie. The acting in the movie is good especially by Joe Pesci. He's a funny guy. So see this movie. bye.",7,2,6,10 August 2002
The Birds," the worst movie ever!!!!!
","This is not only the worst movie Hitchcock ever made but it is also the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life, which I think is saying a pretty lot considering I've seen over hundred movies in the last two months alone. The whole premise of the movie is not a bad idea, I don't think. But it's ruined by the terrible acting, and the complete and utter lack of any suspense or scares whatsoever. This movie is so bad that it's actually funny. Plus, it has some of the dumbest and most annoying characters in the history of motion pictures. This movie is an atrocious monstrosity, one of the most overrated movies ever, and it should never be seen again by anyone for the rest of eternity! bye.",1,34,69,7 August 2002
Princess Mononoke," quality motion picture
","Once again, I gotta hand to the Japanese. They sure know how to make a great animated movie. This movie reminded me of Akira in that the animation is absolutely amazing. This is truly a beautiful movie. And it's got great characters and a great story to boot. Everybody should see this movie. bye.",9,0,1,7 August 2002
The Wizard of Oz," magical
","The Wizard of Oz is absolutely classic. This is far and away one of the greatest motion pictures of ever made. It is a truly magical motion picture experience with so many memorable moments, characters, lines, songs, etc. I grew up watching this movie. I loved it when I was 4, and I still love it now. Fantastic. bye.",9,1,3,15 August 2002
The Godfather," not bad not great
","The Godfather is not a bad movie. But no way in hell is it one of the Greatest movies of all time. It's not great at all. It's a decent movie, but it is absolutely overrated. It didn't even set any precedents or break new ground or anything. It's just a 3-hour long gangster movie with not interesting stuff happening. OVERRATED!!!!!!!",6,3,9,26 July 2002
