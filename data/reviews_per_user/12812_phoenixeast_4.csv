Requiem for a Dream," I've been there and I loved how it was portrayed.
","This movie speaks out against excess and false dreams. It shows how people can be deluded into following something that they think is right just to find out that it is wrong. Or worse, they end up never knowing they were doing the wrong thing. Allow me to explain. I was once involved in a multi-level type marketing company called ds-max. Tappy's continual use of the word juice brought back a lot of bad memories about this experience. Ds-max affiliated companies have their own jargon which uses the word 'juice' a lot. They will say 'juice by (insert name)' to express praise, or 'juice by that' to express approval or just 'juice!' to stir up excitement. People will get caught up in the fake materialistic hype of dsmax and then spin there wheels and then get nothing for it in the end - just like the characters in the movie.The son wanted to make money and make his mom proud. The mother wanted to follow an unrealistic dream and make her son proud. But they really should have just acted responsibly and been realistic and done the best they could to help each other. But they were too a like. There were many scenes that showed how the deceased father was the one that was able to keep the family going and set these two error prone souls straight. With him gone, the mother and son failed to use discipline and wisdom to correct themselves. And that is how people are when they are caught up in multi-level marketing company that uses cult like techniques to keep their corp of recruits faithful. I would recommend this movie to anyone that has problems with any kind of addiction or multilevel marketing companies or unrealistic materialistic goals. It is a great tool to ground oneself.",8,0,1,2 December 2004
Alexander," Big name actors, but unrealistic
","The lure of the this movie was seeing the actors. Colin Farrel steals your heart away with his good looks and charisma, Angelina Jolie is a great evil woman and Anthony Hopkins does some great speeches.But the idea that Alexander the Great was out there unifying the planet so that everyone could live free is just too insane for me to believe that they put in the movie. They keep throwing the word freedom around so much that it makes the movie seem like an extension of the Bush administration in the same way that it wants to name french fries - freedom fries. In addition, there were some scenes that just went on far too long with graphics and solemn music. Come to the point already! Glad I waited for video.",5,0,1,13 September 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," I liked it!
",I liked this film! It had many funny situations and dealt with real problems that people face. I would have voted higher but for the dance routine of Olive at the end. I thought it was highly inappropriate for a girl of her age to move and dress like that. If they would just take that routine out I would have given the movie a 10.The film touched on many parts of life. A gay Uncle that is very smart and almost commits suicide because his life all but goes down the drain. And then you see him in many scenes with his straight nephew that is a classic goth type yet is in to Nietzche.The fathers self help step spiel was a riot. Yet one more person with a method to achieve anything that no one will listen to.It was touching how the whole family was willing to back this little girl.,7,7,11,28 September 2006
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The special effects are pretty good, but the movie does not do the book justice
","I read the Hobbit many times as a boy and I honestly wanted this to be a good film. There were a lot of special effects that were pretty good. The shire village was constructed pretty well, the orcs all looked fierce and the wargs were scary. But I was disappointed with the way the story was changed. He had Thorin Oakenshield being a hater of Elves! This just was not true and it is far too much poetic license. And then the movie was prolonged another 45 minutes by putting in a new quarrel between Thorin and the pale skinned Orc. The movie was too drawn out, it should have come to the point quicker. The Hobbit is already a good story and it is not necessary to add or subtract from it. 100 years from now people will still be reading the hobbit but I doubt they will be seeing this movie.",3,2,14,22 December 2012
