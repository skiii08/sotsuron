Requiem for a Dream," What are you people thinking, an 8.5?
","Those of you that rate this movie so high must have thought Refer Madness was Oscar material.  I appreciate what the movie tries and succeeds in doing which is to scare people away from drugs.  Great, but the people that need this sort of movie aren't the people that are going to sit all the way through it.  The idea of the movie is transparent.  There are no surprises. It would be great to show your teenagers to shock them but the content often walks the border of being XXX pornographic so it loses even that appeal. The movie doesn't have any real entertainment value.  There isn't anything to learn, and the moral is lost on only a small few. The movie is done well but, again, so was Refer Madness in its day. I only recommend this movie to people who think High Time is great reading.",4,1,4,3 September 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," TERRIBLE.
","This movie was absolutely horrible.  I want that 2 hours of my life back. It is extremely predictable and written by a formula.  Depp did his usual strong performance, but I wonder if he actually read the script before agreeing to do the movie.  My guess is that he was looking for a money maker and the Disney logo spelled cash.  It must be expensive living in France. Even though Depp performed well, the persistent intentional head bobbing was annoying.  It could have been understandable if there was anything resembling a story.",1,10,30,27 August 2003
Concussion," Nazi Propaganda Machine would have been envious!
","In my 50 years on the planet, I've never seen such a piece of lopsided idealistic garbage. I'm a big fan of Will Smith. I'm also a fan of the NFL and Science. I not a big fan of propaganda. If I'm to believe this movie, the NFL forced the FBI to indite an innocent doctor and, just for fun, give Will Smith's character's wife a miscarriage. This is not an exaggeration. The implication was not subtle in the movie it was beaten into your skull much like a head on collision in the NFL. The NFL's omnipotence is mostly focused on it's ability to trick everyone into believing that getting hit in the head couldn't possibly be bad for you, but those little extras are thrown in just to remind you that God works for the NFL too. That must be why the movie says the NFL took over God's day.The NFL certainly could have taken steps long ago, which they now have, to make the game safer. Some say too safe. Taking the decision to allow players with possible concussions back into the game out of the players and coaches hands is an obvious addition that few could disagree with. This movie movie doesn't address any of that. The movie simply should have been call the Saints vs The Devil (aka the NFL). This picture is that simplistic in it's portrayal of characters.Now I've been a soldier for nearly 30 years. The military has never once told me that getting shot could be bad for my health. Should I sue?",2,5,11,23 May 2016
X-Men," Mutated humans battle evil mutants.
","Comic book  fan or not, you will enjoy this movie.  The film is plot driven with twists and subtle turns not often found in an action movie.  And of course there is the action and special effects we have come to expect in our age.  There are differences that will disappoint the Marvel Comics readers but also some that are engaging which can't be said for all screen adaptations.  The movie is well cast (excepting Cyclops) and focuses on Wolverine who is well played by Hugh Jackman even if he is taller than the 5'4 character.  The movie is not an ensemble, but relegates even Patrick Stewart (Professor X, Jean Luc Picard for you trekkies) to a supporting cast role despite his strong performance.  The movie certainly was a hit for my 13 and 11 year old kids and was appropriate viewing for children their age without excessive violence or adult content.  There is some minor swearing. There is obvious sex appeal for the adults in addition to the story and action.  While, Famke Janssen (strong resemblance Elizabeth Hurley) as Jean Grey, Halle Berry as Storm, and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos - Mystique will keep the men entertained, my wife couldn't stop talking about Wolverine on the way home.  There's not much that I can say about the plot without giving too much away other than, as expected, bad guys try to take over the world and good guys try to stop them.  Certainly an old premise but done with flair. Ian McKellen does a masterful job of portraying the villain Magneto without being over the top and maintaining a believable quality.  In the end, the movie left several openings for a sequel and the audience wanting more.  As a fan of the X-men comics, etc., I expected an ending with a little bit more flourish, but was more than happy with the overall film. 8",8,0,0,16 July 2000
The Matrix Reloaded," Perfect example of a little is good so a lot must be great, WRONG!
","Perfect example of a little is good so a lot must be great, WRONG!  A lot is overkill.  The mix of ridiculous and long fight scenes with preaching diatribes is enough to make even teenagers to question this movie.  The movie is suppose to end on a cliffhanger for the upcoming sequel in the fall.  I could care less and have no intention of going to see it.  I loved the original.  Some movies shouldn't have sequels.",4,0,0,16 May 2003
