Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," EXCELLENT! EXCELLENT! EXCELLENT!
","What in the heck is the media's problem? Personally, I think so many people in the media are liberals and this movie has a definite morality inconsistent with their politics and sensibilities. It talks of honor, honesty, responsibility, love, duty, right and wrong, good and evil, truth, and it hits hard on corruption in the government, politicians in general -- you get the idea.This movie is excellent. I've actually seen it three times (in the first three days) to study why it has received so much criticism. And basically, it is a perfectly-executed movie. There's not a part you could take out without damaging some of the message or story/character development.Bravo, George Lucas! This is what we need. Thank heaven he is not a pawn of Hollywood or this would have been a GRAVE disappointment!",10,0,0,26 May 1999
