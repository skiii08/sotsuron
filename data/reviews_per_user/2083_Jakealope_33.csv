The Rock," Complete Dreck
","This is a typical Bay-Bruckheimer over the top action movie crapfest with a cheesy plot and colorful but utterly phony characters. It has no basis in reality, that we are to presuppose that some military men would not only pull such a traitorous mutinous maneuver, but do it in such a muddled way. It is pure formula ala Die-hard or some other meaningless Willis or WWF star sort of movie. Don't get me wrong, even Die-hard, at least the first one, was way better than this one.To it's credit, it makes no pretensions of class but serves up violence, military machismo and explosive special effects to satiate the knuckledraggers it is aimed at in a professional high budget way",2,1,6,5 February 2010
3:10 to Yuma," Pathetic Post Modern Plot and Theme
","I am no great fan of westerns, but I do like them occasionally. Maybe I am a traditionalist, but sometimes you have to have some sort of line between average folks, lawmen and ruthless killers and thieves. This movie makes the good into bad and the bad into good, not all the way, but close to it. The hero is Christian Bale as down on his luck family man rancher Dan Evans. He was the only bright light in the movie and played a decent man trying to make the best out of dangerous job. But he is supposed to be missing a leg which really doesn't slow him down a whit. Russel Crow is Ben Wade, our charismatic bad guy, charming anti-hero, that is the charmer almost everyone wants to love, it seems. The lawmen seem to be all crooked or almost as bad as the criminals so when they get killed by our charming anti-hero, we are on the anti-hero's side. Chief example of this is the bounty hunter Byron McElroy, played well by Peter Fonda. He is full of Bible quotes and is brave, but our charming anti-hero knows him well and lets him live after the initial hold up. But later, as the motley crew is leading our charming anti-hero to Contention, where the train in the title was to be boarded, he informs us that Byron McElroy killed a bunch of renegade Apache women and children in some mop up campaign. Then when Byron McElroy went and insulted Wade's parents, this after Wade killed one of the crew earlier, Wade jumps Byron McElroy, grabs his guns, and turns the table on his escorts, who he lets live after taking the horses but throws Byron McElroy off a cliff for insulting his parents. Great, a rude Apache civilian killer is killed off by the charismatic bad guy yet no one is appalled by another killing cause being a cool bad guy, he only kills people who deserve it somehow. To throw another detail in, Byron McElroy only reads the Bible and is a believer. Not that I am some right wing commentator, but why throw that detail in too in a time when many people were like that. Of course, our real hero and our charming anti-hero bond together as they respect each other's manhood. Time after time, our charismatic anti-hero is in control and simply lets his escorts bring him to the train. Meanwhile, his murderous wraith of a second, Charlie Prince, leads the rest of his band on vicious ride to liberate our charismatic anti-hero. He actually played that part well as a totally dedicated psycho, a Hollywood staple. But once again, the good guys seemed incapable of killing him or the gang off and he just kills and kills. For instance, in the end he offers the citizens of Contention $200 a piece for every lawman they kill, but as the locals join in to help, he goes and kills them off, why? When the movie ends, it is because our charismatic anti-hero decides it's time to go to prison, what? In that way it is better than the 'Unforgiven' where a killer bad guy Clint Eastwood 'hero' gets 'redeemed' by going on a hit-man job and killing off half a town full of vigilantes, who lack the moral purity of the criminal who somehow atoned for his crimes by living ten years murder and alcohol free and had a couple of kids. I know, we are all supposed to be so hip that we know the good guys are all crooked and the bad guys are charming, but this movie just rubs that into our face so much I wish for the simple days when bad meant bad.",3,1,3,3 May 2008
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Nothing Too Amazing But You Get Your Money in 3D
","Okay, you all probably know the scenario now as Alice battles the undead and the Umbrella Corporation on a wasted post apocalypse earth. It starts out with a massive amount of CGI as Alice and clones storm the Tokyo HQ of U.C. The gals cut down swarms of Japanese guards with throwing stars, samurai swords, machine guns, bombs etc, all in state of the art CGI and 3 D with lot's of Matrix ripoff thrown in.Then the head honcho of U.C., Albert Wexler, all T-virused out with red eyes, shoots Alice up with the cure with a hypo in her neck, so Alice becomes human again in his VTOL escape plane. She thanks him for that, just before the plane crashes into the side of a mountain, you'd think they would have a better autopilot than that. That crash was frozen in space as everything inside the fuselage continued forward ala Newton's Law, but since Alice is now human, one would think she would have been crushed and burned, along with super Wexler.But in the next scene she is piloting a single engine plane over Alaska, no mean feat crossing the Pacific non stop, looking for Arcadia, the promised land from the last movie. No dice, instead of the promised land, she finds a runway full of empty planes and some doped up crazed Claire Redfield, almost a zombie due to some creepy mechanical spider full of some drug attached to her chest. So after Claire is subdued, they are back in that little plane, which seems to have unlimited range. and flying south to good old LA, which anyone would guess is the nexus of disaster as in every end of the world movie ever made. They land on top of an urban high rise prison full of various survivors in a daring rooftop, gravity & reality defying landing where they meet some fellow survivors.Okay, Arcadia is not a town, it is a ship, some huge cargo one, which happens to be in L.A. harbor but there is a horde of zombies separating the 'prisoners' from 'safety' I won't go on too much more except to say there is the usual stunts and laws of Physics defying tricks by Alice & Claire. Even though supposedly Alice lost all her super abilities, you'd never guess by her endless super stunts. Or her matched sawed off double barrel shotguns that she loads coins, bigger than the bore, to make them super guns.You get pretty much a bunch of cool special effects, the usual twists and characters you'd expect as well as an ending left open for the sequel. No one is expecting a masterpiece or great acting and dialog, but if gives you what you expect and more if you are familiar with the last 3.",6,3,12,19 September 2010
Star Trek," Takes the History, Gadgets & Characters of the OId But Leaves out the Theme
","While this 'reboot' is certainly a lot better than the last 3 odd 'The Next Generation' themed features, it is more of a muscular amped up sci fi action adventure movie than a true Trek storyline. In that the plot is simple: Surviving Romulans get all bent out of shape because their star went supernova, while Spock the Vulcan was on the way to help them, that they go back into time to get revenge on the Federation and Spock for failing to get their in time. Of course, it is rather sour grapes since the Romulans were antagonistic to the Federation long after the Klingons made peace. Time travel is a weak plot device most of the time, so that is one strike. Two, the whole plot is built around revenge and destruction, which is hardly an inspiring, open, looking into the unknown type of theme that made Star Trek so popular.Also, it made Kirk and all the TOS regulars of the same age and class, sans Spock. So it was more like a Dawsons Creek teen adventure motif. Kirk is some bad ass tearaway, since his dad died fighting our time traveling revenge seeking Romulan, that he steals his uncle's 1967 Corvette Stingray and drives it off a cliff, jumping to safety at the last moment, to the sounds of the Beastie Boy's 'Sabotage' on the car's radio. While even I laughed at such a crowd pleasing scene, it was definitely simple minded juvenile defiance and larceny, hardly auguring future greatness. From then on, it is one hijink after another, with some interesting action scenes, some downright silly like being chased by some ice monster after being stranded by Spock for defying Spock's commands. Why they couldn't just lock Kirk in the brig was never explained. But the ice monster did lead him to the future old Leonard Nimoy Spock, also stranded on the same ice planet by the bad Romulan Nero. Than that silly set of coincidences leads them to find Scotty, who is by himself with a robot helper on the same remote ice world working on a fancy transporter system. I mean is this supposed to be taken seriously? They aren't obligated to follow Star Trek 'history' to the letter, but please be a little real, not one silly coincidence after another.There is no sense of finding and dealing with the unknown and man or the future, just the obligatory showdown where blah blah all is put right in the end, bad guys poof! So if you are looking for a decent action adventure movie and know nothing about Star Trek, you'll like it. But if you are looking for a newer and better Trek, no way!",4,4,6,12 December 2011
Dawn of the Dead," Nothing Tops the Original, But in an Age of Lame Remakes
","This one is 1000x as good as the current spate of remakes of classics like the 'Hills Have Eyes' or the 'Omen' which is so derivative, why bother. Face it, Romero's original DotD was the greatest movie ever made, no debate. This movie can't reach that mark, of course. But Zach wisely recycled old zombie motifs, characters and settings but came up with something good and original.Don't worry, there are tons of great zombie head shots, and I ain't referring to cameras. There is the coward, Steve, who screws the rest. There is the big black guy, Ken, who is tough, but isn't good at organizing. Mike is the main character: one of life's losers who has a good way with people and can foresee danger and new approaches, besides having a conscience. Ana, Sara Polley is cute and tough, but not like one of today's psycho woman Rambos. She is emotional and sensitive but understands that this ugly new reality requires extreme measures, which she learns to take. Besides, she brightens up the screen a bit. There is the bad-ass security guard CJ, who after his little tyranny is overthrown, becomes a tough fighter. By far, CJ has the best lines and pretty funny in his tough guy way;'You can take your ass over to the Quality Inn if it's still there, Shaq! '. Throw Andre, some black hustler, his pregnant Russian wife Luda, and a scrappy working class pair, a few girls and a Matt Frewer cameo, and you have a basic Canadian ensemble type of casting. Of course, the usual references to the original: 'tv spots' by Scott Reninger, Ken Foree and Tom Savini(who recreates the sheriff from Night), Qualpeco truck, and Gaylen Ross boutique and you can see that Zach acknowledges his master. It is more serious than the original, without the zombie as consumer theme. The action scenes are great, but I could live without the slow motion shots of spent shell casings hitting the floor. Also, his zombies are speed freaks, not the lumbering, kinda harmless looking ones you'd expect. His one great scene of horror, the shootout with the crazy hustler and the truck driving woman which leads to the discovery of the newly born zombie baby. That was true horror with a minimum of gore. But Romero's low budget classic used a real mall and got real firemen, soldiers and cops to help out for free. His little crew worked for next to nothing. Though it is crude by today's cgi, it's semi guerrilla movie look is endearing. While this one, hardly a huge budget, has all the gloss the old one lacked, as well as having some good B level actors like Mekhi Phifer, Ving Rhames and Sarah Polley. a must for any horror buff, an absolute necessity for a zombie fan and a remake that won't hurt or upset any fans of the original.",9,0,1,18 October 2006
Star Trek Into Darkness," It is not a bad movie, but it sucks anyways
","Star Trek spawned many feature films starring the crews from the original series, Kirk, Spock, etc and Next Generation, Picard, Worf, etc TV series & one with a mix of the two. Honestly, most of those movies were schlock, far worse than this one many levels. But they were the real ST deal, since they had the real actors and Roddenberry's guidance behind them.The three following TV series, while having their faults, continued the ST tradition. Even the retro last one, Enterprise, did okay until it degenerated into mindless alien fights like the one with time traveling alien baddies where they all went back to alt reality Earth 1944 to fight Nazis & aliens. Any sci fi that needs a Nazi plot should pack it up!This movie, while very competently made, is a fake. Abrahms is good at characters, but the characters from the Original Series have been etched into our collective consciousness for decades so imitating them is no big deal, I am sorry. They did a good job of trying, but it just flopped. Pine is not Shatner, and lacked the level of genial pomposity and arrogance that Shatner used to make Kirk. Not can Quinto hold a candle to Nimoy. And bringing Nimoy on board as Old Spock, a double Spock trick, via time travel was really grasping at plot straws. The Khan character substitute just sucked & redoing an old TV show then movie plot line reeked of desperation. Star Trek is supposed to explore new planets, new civilizations, new life forms. Okay, some of that was corny like the Chicago Roaring 20s gangster world, but even that was fun. But all Abrahm's two reboots did was recycle the same old characters, planets & species. For instance the opening scene where they saved the stone age inhabitants of the red planet while visusally arresting, missed the mark. Kirk & McCoy were obviously observing, possibly interacting with the aliens before it started with them being chased. But did Abrahms 'bore' us with the previous interactions with the primitives or why were the duo walking on the surface near them to begin with? Nope, they were just there to be chased then the two jump off a cliff into the water, yadda yaddaIt is an epoch failure since it missed the whole ethos of Star Trek in favor of Bondian Star Wars action and slapstick",3,3,7,9 October 2013
Crash," Tough Racial and Psychodrama Picture
","It had all the modern premier film touches: great shooting, good acting, but a flawed, cheesy script and theme with that annoying ethereal emo music. I was not impressed with the same old racial stereotypes, but they did change them up a bit. Even the black punks in the beginning, who babble on about imaginary racial conspiracies while proving the black negative stereotype correct, felt flat. For instance, the bigoted gun store owner, not a far out stereotype from my experience, would probably put business ahead of bigotry and not tick off his Iranian customers. Though to it's credit it showed everyone being racist to everyone else. There was even a subplot where two undercover cops crash into each other then shoot it out, a dead black the surviving white. The LAPD wants to hang the white survivor out as a scapegoat to the black power mob while the black investigator assigned to the case has serious doubts.One of the saddest scenes was when the black investigator's junkie mother was ranting about how 'his people' killed her other criminal carjacking son. Well, technically it was true. But if anyone led to her dead criminal son turning out how he did, it was his worthless junkie mom. In a sad way that is so real, the people who do the most complaining cause the most damage.Basically, this was a B level melodrama that would have been dynamite in the 60's but in the 2000's, it sounds worn out, exploitative and tinny. But it did try to tackle a serious issue and is probably one of the best of its type. I went back to this because of all the racial tensions created by the media and the black power race baiting mob in these days. The latest racial nonsense like the Oscars are too white really grind my gears, not to mention such rubbish as making a total punk lowlife like Michael Brown into an innocent victim, replete with lies about how he was holding his hands up when he was shot. Compared to all the garbage like I mentioned, this movie was almost documentary and objective. AND IT WON THE Oscars, yet the race baiters like Jada Pinkett seem to forget that. As well as having some good twists.",6,13,20,24 February 2006
The Expendables," Pure Rubbish, Juvenile Greaser Trash as Mainstream
","Stallone, like his Rambo character, has come full circle in his life and showed himself to be at heart an ignorant greaser punk still in junior high. Here is a great example: his gang of mercenaries, when they aren't flying around the world killing for fun & profit, they hang around some grungy tattoo parlor/garage where they sport their Harleys and old 50s & 60s hot rods while getting more moronic body graffiti etched onto their bulked out torsos. There they get a chance to spout their grade school locker room wisdom & bond. Not that Rambo was a work of art, but at least that character had some wounded noble savage quality to him that made him more bearable than the total cardboard murder machine he played in this one. Also, the latest Rambo movie, while offering up the extreme violence & usual gory savagery that Stallone helped make mainstream years ago, at least helped expose the world to the plight of the Kachins in Burma, as opposed to this excuse for gore and violence.I still can't figure out the plot of this movie, something about being set up in some Latin America banana republic, shot in Brazil for 'authenticity'. How or why seems unimportant but there is this not so bad stereotyped banana republic dictator who is a pawn of a stereotyped CIA/mercenary type played by Eric Roberts. The poor script tried to show that the bad stereotyped banana republic dictator wasn't so bad, just a tool of the always bad CIA man. But in the end that wasn't very apparent either.But here is a revealing scene. When Rocky and Jason go there to do some re-con and meet some femme fatale contact, the stereotyped banana republic dictator's daughter, they are taken prisoner then do some very savage knife and gun fighting to get free. There is an obligatory chase scene through the stereotype Latin American town to the pier where their seaplane is tied up. The femme fatale refuses to board the plane to escape but our two boys do. When they fly off there are about 50 soldiers on the pier shooting at the plane taking off, I guess in revenge for the duo savaging about 20 of them earlier. The plane gets aloft, then Jason climbs into the nose of the plane while Rambo pilots it and he comes out halfway out this little hatch in the top of the nose exposed to the air blast. Then we see that there is 4 machine guns in the plane's nose so Rocky banks the plane so Jason can fire the guns & mow the soldiers on the pier down, almost winging Rambo's new love, the femme fatale. Duh, like wouldn't it make more sense to hook those guns up to a remote trigger and have a sight inboard so the pilot can aim & fire while flying, just like they have been doing since late World War 1? They finish that scene off by spraying the dock with the plane's fuel and burning up the survivors when they fire the all purpose flare gun at the dock.it just goes on and on, mass violence where none of his team even gets winged. Oh one more scene, one of his team, played by equally brain dead Lundgren is a rebel and goes over to the other side. He tries to off Rambo in Rambo's 50's hot rod pick up truck but his 9mm bullets from his submachine gun won't penetrate the armored windows or body. You'd think Dolph, since he hung out there in the tattoo parlor/garage too, would know that his boss's truck was armored plated, so use a better gun.There is no redeeming value at all to this flick, even the cameo by Willis & Arnold is all talk in a church. It is just a lot of ultra violent gore and mayhem for overgrown boys with nothing intelligible in between. It is an utterly comic book movie because the source material is, guess, a comic book!",1,14,30,7 September 2010
The Devil Wears Prada," Great Movie for Even the Fashion Haters
","First off, it has the classic 'small town, good hearted (and looking) working girl trying to make it in the greedy City' plot, which is nothing new but a good frame. Anne Hathaway, as Andrea Sachs, does a good job as a recent journalism school grad taking a vicious gopher job for a the uber fashion Nazi of all times: Miranda Priestly! Andrea is unfashionable and doesn't even recognize that this miserable job, that fashion clones would kill for, means working for the Queen of that industry. Miranda Priestly is Meryl Streep to the nines and she plays it without any camp or ham. SHe was wonderful as the cold hearted ruthless King Lear, someone who berates poor Andrea Sachs for failing to book a Miami to NYC flight for her in the middle of a hurricane. Poor ANdrea puts up with her fascist nonsense and all the superficial fashion clones as a year of apprenticeship to the Devil herself. This will open doors for the kind of journalism that she really wants to do, she hopes.Stanly Tucci plays Nigel, the kind of stereotypical career art layout man, devoted to Runway and Miranda, but with a heart of gold, in a totally forgettable part. Best in the support department, was Emily Blount, a newcomer, playing Emily, the devil's first apprentice. She is a towheaded English prig, who became a bitch by breaking her butt trying to satiate the Devil. She is miserable and calculating but you can't really hate her as she watches Andrea rise at her expense. One of the plot points revolve around the annual Paris fashion revue. Emily would normally go with the devil, she spent weeks dieting and learning French and the names of all the nabobs. But Emily gets a cold, and the germaphobic Devil discards her in favor of perky Andrea. Andrea feels really guilty taking Emily's place in Paris, which she didn't ask for and if the tables were turned, Emily would almost stab her a shot at Paris. Then there is the plot point where she alienates her scruffy boyfriend and clique as she turns into a ambitious fashion clone. Or success is spoiling her!The biggest attraction is the glimpse of the fashion industry. Even someone like me who hates all that overpriced couture 'stuff' and vacuous super model arrogance can find it interesting. It is an industry were superficiality and appearances are everything and good character and personality are an impediment. I admire the industry's ruthless approach to the new 'LOOK'. Here Streep's genius shines in her role as the chief 'Priest' of this underworld. It isn't just sex that makes it attractive, it is their Venusian standard of beauty and style that makes it attractive to me. After all, all the sex appeal of the industry is there to sell to the women, not men like a Bud commercial. Hollywood might get superficial, but there are a lot of interesting souls like Woody Allen, Martin Scorcese, Jack Nicholson, Robert Altman or Winona Rider. But they wouldn't flourish to well in this industry; an industry where looking good is not only everything, but a 60 hour/week job too! But the movie is nothing too heavy and is quite suitable for teenagers, but that isn't bad because it is about something that one can't take too seriously.",5,0,0,14 September 2006
Forrest Gump," Surest Way to Win an Oscar
","Make a movie about a retard, or play one. Look at Hoffman in 'Rainman' or Miles in 'Ryan's Daughter', they won Oscars for playing retards too. You can't go wrong with a stupid person as the focus, sort of like the chimp lead. Better yet, endow him with all sorts of savant-like talents like superhuman strength and sports agility. What silly, contrived hokum. This is a sentimental piece of schlock that is always simple and forced. 'Life is like a box of chocolates', yeah, right! The only one who deserved the Oscar lost, Gary Sinise. Finally, use cgi to work the retard into all the key TV/pop culture moments, guaranteed to melt a boomer's heart. Have him influence the whole world with his simple homespun Gomer Pyle platitudes. If the director had another 10 minutes to fill, Gump would have redesigned the Apollo space ship program and got the astronauts to the Moon. Enough sugar here to rot our whole country's teeth. It proves that pop culture really sucks. 'Pulp Fiction' was it's dark Oscar nominated rival in 1994. It was a better movie with a sicker message so it lost to this treacle,",2,23,53,30 June 2002
The Killing Fields," Great Movie, Even with it's NY Times Slant
","This was one of the all time great movies. My main peeve however, was the typical NY Times slant on the whole thing. Schanberg's leftist ranting made no sense in the long run. The domino theory was proved by these events, not disproved. If the US had stayed and supported South Vietnam and Cambodia, those tragedies would be avoided, ideas foreign to a leftist ranter like Schanberg. Bombing doesn't cause normal folks to turn into blood thirsty Communist tyrants. Did the people of London, Berlin, Tokyo or Malta massacre each other after WWll? The Khmer Rouge were merely following the well worn path of Communist tyranny and totalitarianism ala Stalin, Mao and Sung, but without the PR job that Ho and Fidel had! It was a real sad movie that did show the depth of evil that the Communists are capable of, the turning of the kids into Communist murderbots who had people killed because they wore glasses or had soft hands. The starvation and impoverishment of everyone except the ruling cadres should be a powerful antidote to the parasites who whine about the inequalities of capitalism. Unfortunately, the Khmer Rouge still persists today in a muted form, thanks to the mindless UN fools.",Null,5,9,18 August 2004
Armageddon," Great Escapism, Hollywood at it's best
","It had all the classic new Hollywood schtick: a collection of irascible psychopaths, nerds and ruff neck drillers and oil explorers, under the lead of Die Hard himself. Willis sets the tone in the beginning when he tees off a golf ball from his drilling platform at a Greenpeace boat. The plot is simple and compelling: Earth will be destroyed by an asteroid unless Willis and his crew, with some interesting astro & cosmonauts flying the ultra useful and dependable space shuttle(Peter Storer as a whacked out Russian cosmonaut, great), to drill a hole in the asteroid and blast it in two with a hydrogen bomb.Real basic stuff, good action and special effects and it's unpredictable. Eliminate the Ben Affleck - Liv Tyler love angle, she plays the boss's daughter, and the drecky song by Aerosmith, replace it with more action, and the movie would be 2x as good. If you ae looking for heavy themes and deep meaning, you will be disappointed, but if you want something entertaining and colorful, this is your ticket",6,1,2,9 May 2006
Salt," Well Made Junk, It's a Mindless Hollywood Action 'Spy' Movie
","This movie has about as much relation to spy craft as watching a Star Trek TV program would help you understand the Apollo space program, but without even the occasional social moral theme that Trek throws in . Nothing in in made any sense. Spies aren't killer cyborgs who can burst into a building and disable trained guards and agents with bare hands or improvise Rube Goldberg devices then deactivate complicated electro-mechanical systems as if they designed and built them themselves. She made Rambo look like a drunk college baseball player fighting in a local college bar on Friday night. She seemed to have the same mythical warrior invincibility as Alice the Enhanced One has in all those Resident Evil movies & video games. I realize that James Bond commando kung fu trained warriors are the norm in movies these days, but at least James Bond used to be novel and humorous, unlike our Terminatrix here.The climax involved a couple of Russian deep plant agents taking over the Whitehouse and president so they can launch nuclear weapons, natch. 'Whitehouse Down' and 'Olympus Has Fallen' had similar plot lines but there at least there was a whole bunch of bad guys, and lots of them were killed fighting the various security forces stationed there. But here one of the agents runs interference for our female cyborg by detonating a suicide bomb vest all of 10' from her, in an underground corridor. But our female terminator was barely fazed by the enormous blast. Or in an earlier scene, she stages this elaborate kill operation on the president of Russia in a cathedral in NYC where she sets up all sorts of stunts and booby traps in a place she was utterly unfamiliar with & had all of five minutes to set up the stunts that worked perfectly. Then she takes out 3 NYC cops in an SUV while in cuffs. Not just that but she used a stun gun to get the driver to shift gears, apply the gas or steer the wheel as if she tapped right into to his neural pathways with the zapper. That was so silly it even one upped the rest of the stunts; and it was pretty sadistic thing to do to some schmoe cop who was just doing his job.I watched it because the highway scene was filmed nearby and I borrowed the DVD gratis. If you like a lot of action but don't care about plot or even a glimmer of reality to the script, then you might like it.That being said, Jolie did well with her limited female kill-bot role. The black CIA Guy, Chiwetel Ejiofor, did well too. The rest of the cast, including wooden Liev Schreiber, were adequate at best. There is nothing I took out of this movie worth remembering save some well done but a load of 'impossible in real life' stunts. Even the paper thin veneer of humanity and ambiguity most of the fawning reviews spoke of are flat. We knew she was some fancy Russian Manchurian double agent type, something about being conditioned in Russia when she was young by the same guy who ratted her out later. That had been established early in the movie. It was easy to predict that she was a good bad guy character who in the end wouldn't do anything very heinous, She'll just kill lots of bad bad guys but only seriously disable the good ones.",2,1,5,28 March 2014
Silver Linings Playbook," A trainload of corn syrup and chicken schmaltz derailed
","I just don't see what was so great about this film, except it was A list budget so it could hire good actors & other stuff to make it a polished work. Don't get me wrong, I like romantic comedies, chick flicks and predictable happy endings. Not every movie has to be some apocalyptic epic full of extreme violence, gore, the undead and mass explosions. But this movie was so full of sugar, it could rot your teeth out. Don't get me wrong, mental illness doesn't have to be treated reverently in some melodramatic fashion, but this movie had about as much relation to real mental illness and sufferers as 'Hogan's Heroes' had to WW 2 POWs.Apparently everyone around Pat Jr, the Bradley Cooper character, seemed to be pulling for him, ready to bend over backwards to help him out. The whole upper working class neighborhood milieu, were Philadelphia Eagles football fans. His father, Pat Sr. my fave De Niro, was the only saving grace in the movie. Dad was an uber superstitious football fan & bookie too. The Sunday game was the center of family life. Even the local cop, who showed up every time he was almost going to violate the restraining order of his ex wife or the frequent heated arguments he got into with parents and locals, was on his side, pulling for him. The multicultural crew included his Indian shrink, who was also a Philly Eagle fan like everyone else, and Chris Tucker, a black fellow inmate from the mental institute who was around for PC comic relief as a semi permanent guest at the Solitano residence. No racism here. The only one who wasn't a foot ball van was Tiffany, played by Jennifer Lawrence, the widowed bipolar nympho. I like her a lot too, but I simply don't see her work as Oscar material just because the movie sucked so bad.The whole plot seemed to be, if you fall in love with the other mentally disturbed woman who wants you, and give up trying to win back your cheating ex wife. all will be well. There was no sense that the two were working on their mental health issues at all. No breakthroughs, no growing up, no revealing group therapy scenes. Compare that to dated-due-to-the-breakdown of the family 'Ordinary People' I watched recently. While that was a drama, it won an Oscar by having some realism and recovery, not by pretending that romantic love is the mental health panacea. Here, the families will all love you and dad will win his bet and get enough money to buy the restaurant and the two losers will live happily ever after at their parent's house, doing an occasional dance contest. The two beautiful mental patients will finally declare their love for each other on a Holiday Season decorated city street at night right out of an old MGM musical.Even the whole dance contest, the crux of the budding Pat & Tiffany relationship, was given short shrift. The DVD had tons of deleted scenes of the two practicing but that was all cut out in the theatrical version. There was simply too much schmaltz for me to take seriously! And what were the plays in that lined play book anyways?",3,5,10,18 May 2013
The White Ribbon," Another 'Why we became Nazis' Story?
","Sometimes you have to ask yourself, is it fair to pass that burden onto a person was 3 when Hitler died? From a sociological POV, I don't think it was that on the mark. Nazism was largely a product of the 20th Century mass, democratic urban society, of largely Catholic roots(Hitler, Austria, Bavaria all Catholic). The Nazis were ex servicemen, mainly mainstream urban working and lower middle class people. It was also a product of a society that was almost totally militarized up to 1919.In contrast, the was set in an agrarian Protestant village. It had the timeless feudal pattern where the baron called the shots from his estate and everyone fell in line. The pastor was the right hand of authority, flanking the baron on the sky front. Even thought military service was compulsory for almost all males, and after active duty, they became reservists. There was none of that in the movie even though almost every village, like the fictional Eichwald, had a drill hall and armory so the Army could easily train & mobilize their men. Yet none of that was discussed even though the movie was just before WW l. Also, at that time, this village pattern was dying as huge industries, opportunities, cities, schools, railways and other institutions sucked the villagers away from their stagnant, poverty ridden villages.This movie might have been better at displaying the roots of Prussian militarism, but Nazism, no. As unpleasant as some of the people were and unjust and authoritarian the way of life was, there were limits to the depths that a traditional society like that would sink. It took a modern, mass movement exploiting mass democratic choices & fears and shorn of any inhibitions from religion or tradition, to perpetrate the horrors of Nazism. It also took a similar society of Communist fanatics to the East to instill fear & to emulate. In defense, this type of traditional society simply fell in line and went along like the rest of the more 'enlightened' urbanized German masses. Also, in defense, one could say the movie was a parable, not to be taken on the literal level as I have done. And as a parable of evil in innocence, it is okay. But I am still waiting for a movie that realistic depicts why they became Nazis.",7,4,12,21 July 2010
Cross of Iron," Great East Front Realism but a Flawed Movie
","Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie. By using Yugoslavia and the local army, who used vintage Russian weapons, it gave it realism that no Hollywood production could match, where Combat! or the Battle of the Bulge used American tanks painted with German crosses. The acting and stars performed well too: Schell, Coburn, Mason and Warner pulled their weight. What I hated was the plot itself: the enemy in this case was the career minded Prussian officer Hauptmann Stransky played by Maximillian Schell. For instance, he wanted to kill the Russian boy soldier prisoner but Steiner stopped him. A little background is in order, the Germans killed millions of Russian pow's, often shooting them right after they surrendered, then the Soviets threw the survivors of the German camps into their own camps after the war. Adding the million of others murdered by the Nazis, including machine gunning 2 million Jews, Stransly would be a saint. Why the filmmaker left out any references to the massive atrocities of the Germans and Russians and focused on one phony glory seeker is beyond me. Peckinpah was famous for his artistic slow mo approach to violence, like in the 'Wild Bunch', but this film lacked the excitement and novelty of that one.Obviously the German writer must have it in for officers and had a class warfare angle to the plot, the plebes versus the Prussian aristocrats. But the Nazis had that same attitude too, so hating aristocratic career Junker officers is hardly some badge of goodness. Once again, it's hard to make a movie about the East Front and ignore all the mass atrocities; that is an atrocity itself, except for the closing credits. It is a good action movie and interesting, and has a good European look so I do recommend it in spite of what I said above. Some of the action scenes are well done and have a better feel than the usual contrived Rambo-Terminator Kung Fu super hyped combat scenes we are dosed with these days.",8,1,5,6 August 2005
Resident Evil," best of it's genre and sub genre and a darn good flick in general
","I never play video games, so I have no attachment to the theme. I saw the sequel a year ago and thought it was lame and derivative, though I liked Milla. I also thought she was the best part of 'The Fifth Element', acting against one of the worst movie killers of all time, Bruce Willis. (OK, he put in a few good roles here and there.) So, I got the DVD of RE and it blew me away. The production value was far superior to almost any of those techno-cyber-man-vs-computer flicks, along with it being better than most zombie and action movies in general. It had the same sort of set and theme as the original 70's techno-science thriller, 'The Andromeda Strain'. The acting and characters were spartan but right on cue. Though most of the team members tended to look alike, they all had some personality and acted more like real people than some soul-less, Ahnuld type killing machines. Milla's body language was excellent, and she was sexy without hamming it up an ounce. She deserved an Oscar and is a pleasure to watch. THough the one scene where she kicks out the mutant dog was lame. Her character suffered from amnesia due to a nerve agent in the beginning and there was a dream like sequence when she awakes on the floor of her shower and is utterly blank. That scene was filmed in a huge German mansion that the Nazis and Communist used for a retreat, done in red, as her skimpy dress she wears. She has to reconstruct her past while battling zombies, genetically engineered killing animals and the Red Queen, or the AI program that runs the hive. But she always maintained her humanity and femininity throughout the horrors she faced and fought. She was paired with Michelle Rodriguez, doing her macha latina schtick as one of the security team members. But the two of them actually complemented each other and it worked well. Michelle Rodriguez as Rain Ocampo offered up some pretty decent comic relief and lines too!The sets and mechanical efx are great, but the cgi beasts were weaker. The cinematography and editing were first rate. The soundtrack was pulsing techno that drove the already good plot along, it was great too.In short this movie set a benchmark for all those cyber-mutant-techno-action-zombie movies that few will beat. Throw us the action, but at least have real people and great but spare efx. It's sequel, of course, was a turkey compared to this. It was made in Europe, which explained it's good techno style, Funny, but my man George A. Romero was supposed to direct it, but gave up. I don't think it would have been as good. Basically, this movie first rate period.",8,0,2,24 February 2006
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Likeable but Ultimately Trivial
","I liked the movie since it covered a time and actors I am familiar with.. It was pleasant fun, especially to see Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate and Damian Lewis as Steve McQueen. Part of the reason this movie came out now was that it dovetailed on the 50 years of the Manson Murder 'Anniversary' which yielded a horrid crop of movies last year. But the main character, Rick Dalton, played by Di Caprio , a fading alcoholic B movie cowboy actor, was unlikable and his travails were boring. But he lived next door to the Tate-Polanski house in LA. But his stunt double side kick and friend-gofer Cliff Booth, played by Brad Pitt, was great as he honed his laid-back tough-guy persona again.
But it had that Inglorious B***erds vibe where real history was altered to make our stars seem cool. Of course, Quentin showed he was great at nailing cowboy movie genre and inserting his actors in classic movies, like putting Rick in a real scene from 'The Great Escape' in McQueen's place.
But ultimately, I felt ho-hum so-what at the end. It was all frosting,albeit good, but no cake.",6,1,3,5 February 2020
2012," You Get Your Money's Worth
","I've seen all the other Emmerich movies about doomsday-in-America scenarios so I am well acquainted with his methods. This movie gives you plenty of destruction as well as interesting sets and locations. There is the usual plethora of characters from all walks of life and continents, but it is mainly centered around John Cusack's Jackson Curtis, a failed sci fi disaster writer (unlike Emmerich & crew) and his estranged wife, prissy Amanda Peet and two (Hollywood only) kids. There is the requisite rainbow set of scientists, big movers and shakers and a squeaky clean magical Negro White House and President, Danny Glover, who else, who sweats out saccharine, and the rest of the blacks who are uniformly heroic, intelligent and noble. Contrast them to his oily chief of staff Anheuser(Get it Busch?), played by Oliver Platt. Then toss in Woody Harrelsonas some low budget Art Bell dj who is on to the end of the world conspiracy-scenario. See the heads of all the world's governments & the elite know a few years in advance about this, so in Tibet, they build all these escape vessels, arks, for a select group, mainly people with money, 1,000,0000,000 Euros a seat. While the rest of the world is ignorant of this seismic event, caused normally benign neutrinos, emitted by the sun, melting the inside of the planet and crust, that until the crevasses swallow them up or volcanoes bury them in ash or lava, they are ignorant. But Jackson and family find out at the last minute and due to him meeting both the DJ and working for a fat Russian billionaire who has tickets, rushes to get to Tibet with his family in utterly Hollywood only escapes in various planes and vehicles only meters ahead of the collapsing earth surface or falling fireballs. The characters are not totally cardboard, but they are predictable and corny as well as they keep the story moving. There are lots of them including the Russian billionaire, who along with his beautiful Russian model and pilot, die just before safety, leaving only his two fat obnoxious kids to survive. But good old Jackson and his family pull through unscathed to an ending where at least the chosen survive to settle in the one last remaining chunk of land, South Africa. Okay, its corny, over the top, implausible but it follows the mold of hundreds of similar movies and does it better. The best thing is that it hardly touched on the Mayan thing but kept it pseudo Scientific.",7,1,2,11 March 2010
Kick-Ass," Very Intreesting and Layed Film
","To be honest, at first I hated this film b4 I saw it. How did some super hero flick just released make it into the Top 250 here with some bratty pre-teen murderous girl as the breakout star. It seemed so contrived. But the best part of it is that it is a layered film. We have some nerdy teen and friends in a semi rough high school and their travails. A raft of brutal street thugs who are reality based and not too over the top. Then you have two almost super heroes, a discredited cop and his daughter, the Macreadys Big Daddy & Hit Girl who are totally over the top in their single minded desire to rid the world of Frank D'Amico and his equally over the top violent mobsters who ruined Macready;s career by getting him framed. With Nick Cage as Big Daddy, a Batman knockoff, be prepared for his trademark role immersion, except this Batman uses guns and likes to kill and trained his 11 year old daughter into a whirling dervish of death, Hit Girl, in a plaid skirt, foul mouth and purple wig. Then throw in the mobster's son, a would be faux super hero, Red Mist, and you have one heck of a movie.There is the awkward teen coming of age aspect as Dave goes would be superhero to compensate for his drab, colorless existence in a trio of comic book fan outcasts. His first attempt at superherodom resulted in getting quite the beating then getting run down accidentally which required extensive orthopedic rebuild ala 6 Million Dollar Man. No one was on to him but now a rumor circulated that he was a fruit, which ironically got the attention of the beautiful girl who ignored him and who was a would be fag hag. His next attempt was a bit more successful and got him publicity as he beat off three hoods bent on stomping another one. That got a lot of attention by the media through a You Tube video.But it started to get dicey when he tried to help his doting fag hag teen beauty Katie Deauxma, who was being harassed by some scumbag street level dealer she met when she volunteered at the drug needle exchange clinic. She doted on that scum who used and abused her so Dave told her to write to Kick Ass's Facebook page for some help. He gets the balls to go into the scum Rasul's apartment full of lowlifes to deliver a message and he almost gets his ass kicked when Hit Girl and Big Daddy arrived to do in the whole lot of them, take their money and save Kick Ass's skin too. The father daughter duo take a liking to him but advised him to stay out of the action. Then it got even more deeper and over the top culminating in a sky scraper storming scene that made the Boondock Saints version look like the lame crap that it was. So you had three layers, the teen coming of age, finding himself and getting laid, some run ins with brutal local lowlifes, then even more violent and brutal mobsters up to the totally over the top Hit Girl, Big Daddy duo leading to the grand finale.",8,1,5,2 October 2010
Gran Torino," Solid Eastwood Work
","This movie was a good solid piece of Eastwood Americana. But it is a stretch to call it a masterpiece, as well intentioned and original as it is. Retired old Walt Kowalski is just a senior citizen version of the same old Clint. He's rude, obnoxious, bigoted, tough but deep inside a real heart of gold, right down to the spitting. His racial cracks, as crude as they are, are meant to show that he is someone who thinks little of every group of people starting with his kids, the Church to the rest of his dissolving blue collar community. ANd he is the tough, brave guy, the blue collar knight, just like Harry. So that gives him the authority to insult and talk down to everyone. The named car, a classic 72 Gran Torino GT muscle car, is like him, loud, tough but out of date. It is also a bit of a second lead given the average American guy's (& gal's) obsession with cars. If you watch the two behind the scenes takes on the DVD you see the makers were well aware of this and weren't shy about exploiting it. Okay, I won't go too far into the plot. The Hmong family next door has a teenager who is being bullied into joining a Hmong gang, led by his cousin. You can see that the surrounding blacks and Mexicans make life hot for the Asians so they adopt the gang mentality right down to the hopped up Hondas, rap and UZIs. Walt's wife dies, and he brushes off his sons and grandkids, who are all greedy and shallow we see. Then later the Hmong kid is pressured into stealing his prize Torino, is sopped by a gun wielding Clint but this leads to him getting closer to the Hmongs next door and being a dad to the would be fatherless thief, Trou. He initiates him into all sorts of manly stuff like fixing household items and how to talk trashy to the local Italian American barber. Then there is the young well meaning priest, who following his dead wife's last wishes, keeps an eye on him, giving Clint one more willing target of his withering abuse. Okay, without revealing more he has to confront the gang who won't let up on Trou and his adopted family next door. But there is always Harry Callahan, except with his trusty Korean War vintage .45 Colt and M1 rather than the .44 S&W. He does a lot of Clint stuff like whipping out his gun and punching out some bad guys and being the roughneck hero. The racial cursing are not over the top but they wear on me after a while, sometimes you wish for not political correctness but a little class and politeness. But it is always Callahan not Kowalski and you know him well from almost 50 years on screen. What redeemed the movie was the not predictable ending and the amateurish but cool pick up cast of real Hmongs. It had a good plot but in the end, it was Harry once again saving the day for us all weaker, PC, good for nothing pussies.",7,1,8,10 July 2009
Garden State," HIgh Minded But Fails
","I must confess that I really despise New Jersey as a whole, so any film named 'Garden State' has two strikes before it comes to bat. I'm sure you readers here already understand the plot, so I won't bore you with rehashing the details. Baiscally, he seeks forgiveness and finds that and love in a trip back home for his mother's funeral; leaving his little failed actor world in LA. Some people have compared it to the 'Graduate' as a generation defining movie. It does have that potential: over medicated on psychotropic drugs, isolated from reality, his old buddies are stay at home wastrels. But the triteness of it all, capped off on the 'it only happens in the movies' love relation with Natalie Portman and the effortless psyche healing via love and banal psycho-babble clichés, makes me wonder what all the sophistos at Sundance saw in this film, where it cleaned up at that festival. I won't trash this film and Braff does have potential, but it is an easily forgettable film that aims high but belly flops.",5,0,1,11 June 2006
Mission: Impossible II," Aside from the High Tech & Kung Foo Stunts
","It was cheesy Bond-like forgettable junk. Jon Woo might be Mr High Speed Action and you get that in spades in this flick, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the original series's concept. The original series involved convoluted plots, deceptions, rubber masks and high tech gadgets executed by a team of experts, emphasis on the team. The original series wasn't John LeCarre or Hitchcock with all those rubber mask switcheroos, but it was plot driven and had no flash. Also, it had almost no violence, sex or chase scenes. The new one is just the opposite: Its all violence, cheesy Bond type lovers, chase scenes, and just Tom. It has nothing at all to do with the spirit of the original series, it's just an action packed, mindless Cruise fest.",1,10,20,23 September 2002
Jack Reacher," Soul-less Throwaway Seen This a 100 Times Before
","Well, of course any A list movie with such a cast and director will have all the basics down pat, except it's a soul-less, unoriginal product that doesn't elevate the audience, at least the thinking ones who appreciate something more than a macho violence fest. It is designed to appeal to the action movie crowd, you know the skinhead tattooed types at the gym or on loud motorcycles who haven't read a book since school stamped their parchment.We have Cruise being Mr. Badass Bullet Chewing Ex Army West Point MP lifer Jack Reacher, who resigned from the Army and lives off the grid with just the clothes on his back. You'd think a lifer like him would at least have a duffel bag with a change of clothes and a toilet kit, but he shows up in Pittsburgh empty handed on a bus. At first he's there to help convict some Army killer he pursued in the past for some mass shooting that happened in Iraq. His character is such macho bs, and so worn out, but that doesn't matter to the audience who apparently need a really smart guy, who can figure all the angles everyone else missed and who can also kill 10 armed men barehanded. It is like Cruise got into character in some BS pseudo-artsy Jap gore fest like 'The Last Samurai' and never got back to reality. Since Mr Perfect is also the producer of this as well as the man who turned Mission Impossible into another generic ultra violent chase scene thriller, I think Cruise really imagines himself as a Reacher cloneSo of course, we know the shooter, or the guy we thought was the shooter, wasn't the bad guy. And we knew that one of the stuffed shirts we met in the beginning was prolly in the pay of the bad guys. And we knew that there was going to be tons of sophisticated weapons and fancy shooting, along with a chase scene involving every bad ass guy's wet dream, a 1968 Chevy Malibu SS 396 4 speed, driven by the master at everything who is, I guess, a good driver in reality. The common iconic 60s muscle car is a stand in for the lameness and unoriginality of the character and the rest of the plot.There is a really bad guy, a Russian, natch, called the Zek, played by a German, Werner Herzog. He is really bad, like he chewed his fingers off to save himself in a Soviet gulag. Then I find out that the real target of this mass shooting, and the subsequent mayhem and expense to cover it up. was someone these ultra evil, ultra well financed guys could have dealt with in their sleep. It reminds me of using a shotgun to kill a fly.I mean these evil guys are so bad, that when they paid some local not-so-evil hood to drive Reacher off by stomping him, which failed of course, the really evil people not only killed their local contact guy, but the five hapless petty criminals their local guy hired for a $100/piece. Heck, once they killed their local contact, there would have been no way for Terminator Reacher to trace it back. But the plots of movies like this are there mainly to provide the set up for the next set of homicides.Then the movie had this old Marine - 'young' Army guy bonding scene at a shooting range. The old guy was Duvall, wdf. Natch, once we got over his crustiness, you knew they would bond so well that after one meeting the old man would drive 200 miles to help the Terminator shoot all the bad guys dead in some night quarry construction site shoot out scene.I hate using the term fascist, because it is so overworked and misused, as well as the two big heroes in the end were operating alone, not part of some storm battalion. But it was fascist, in that it espoused these ultra conservative, ultra macho military trained militaristic guys are the key to help us clean up society. For sure, we do need these types sometime, but in movies & TV today it seems the message we get is that this is the way to deal with all the bad parts of life. IT is all some Manichean struggle where soul-less, rootless good guys can waste all sorts of ultra heinous, well equipped and almost as competent bad guys then walk away for a good breakfast as Dennys. I know, this is just supposed to be escapist fare, but maybe we should ask ourselves if trash like this from A listers is causing so many people to be alienated and go over the edge. Yeah, yeah, 99.99% of the people who watched this won't do anything sadistic or insane, but what about that .01%?PS: I just made the connection between this movie and some similar stinker set in Pittsburgh, 'Striking Distance'. That cheesy Bruce Willis, over the top macho action flick got more than its share of razzies from the fans & critics. If you take that movie as parody of its genre which it is, it is more palatable than this macho militaristic cowboy sadistic nonsense.",2,0,4,5 June 2014
War of the Worlds," Good, True to Novel but Flawed Adaptation
","I always had a special place for 'War of the Worlds' from when I read the novel in 5th grade and stayed up late to watch 1953 'The War of the Worlds'. Recently, I re-read the novel, set in Edwardian pre-WWl England. The 1953 movie had it's flaws and tried to be upbeat in that noxious 1950's way where the novel was pessimistic about England and man in general. The 1953 film even had words of praise for the doomed British and their fighting spirit when the book had them melt into mass panic and selfishness after the first string of disasters.What tripped up the movie was not Spielberg's pretensions or Tom Cruise's eternal pretty boy act but the actual plot and characters. Spielberg was trying to work a modern split family-stupid dad theme to it. You just couldn't respect the hero, Ray Ferrier crane operator(like a modern Fred Flintstone) He wouldn't even use some force to knock his two bratty, smart ass kids in line during the flight from NJ or intelligently stock up on necessities in flight. He was too common to admire; he was rebuilding his 69 Mustang's V-8 in his kitchen and his kids were like 30 points higher IQ and years ahead in sophistication. He was almost a serious Homer Simpson. Then, his great plan for the attack onm earthj, go from NJ across from Manhattan to BOSTON, MASSACHUSSETS! Why Boston, why would anyone want to get boxed in in Boston, as well as travelling a dangerous corridor to get there? Well, there is the plot line. His only concern, besides running to Boston, was to protect his daughter from any ugly sites by blindfolding her. His one heroic scene was accidental. What about the rest of humanity, Ray? Like your friends and the people you saved? Why not team up for survival and resistance like a man, instead of running like a mouse? The efx and the Martians were good and it was truer to the novel than the 1953 version. Obviously, Ebert never read the novel, with his ignorant comment on tripods. But the character in the novel was an intellectual who had no real plans, fled alone and was no great hero. In this flick, he was a blue collar scheisskopf. That is what really hurt it. Dakota Fanning needs to be phased out, her precocious little brat routine is getting stale, as she carried quite a bit of the movie. His son, Justin Chatwin, did better but he was another modern brat, but didn't suck up space like his stage sister. I gave it a seven due to good concept, efx, camera work, great scenes of the destruction of the Pulaski Skyway and I love WotW.",4,1,1,24 November 2005
Downfall," Best Hitler Movie Ever
","I saw this movie on DVD, forgetting all the hoopla over the premier of a movie that 'humanized' Hitler. It did precisely that: it humanized a monster because he was really human and it showed him for the ugly, little cruel man he was. That he was kind to his help and his dog weighs light in his balance against his mass murder and all out war. Bruno Ganz blew away all those pompous Brits who normally star in those Hitler-in-the-Berlin-bunker sort of movie. He was awesome, almost real. The scenes above ground in bomb/shell/bullet ravaged Berlin are like Dutch master portraits of hell. Here, we see Berlin in her death agony at the end of the greatest war. Now it's the Zero Hour, Stunde Null, in Berlin in all the horror and absurdity. Ironically, they used the ultimate WW ll victim city as for location, St. Petersburg or Leningrad. It captures the feeling of one of the most horrific battles in modern history, in small, block by block scenes of small scale horror. The most horrible scene however, occurred in the bunker, as ugly Frau and Herr Goebbels poison their five children to death, before doing the world a favor by killing each other.The movie is based on Traudl Junge's story, a pretty young steno/secretary of Hitler, and what she saw in those horrible last days. She was a teenager from Bavaria who was hired to be Hitler's steno in 1942, when the war seemed distant and going well, and lived in his court from then on. She adored Hitler like a teeny bopper going nuts over some rock star. But in the end, with the horror swirling around her and her idol ranting about killing even the German people and all his entourage off as the climax to his 1000 Year Reich, she reconsiders him a bit. Eva Braun was portrayed as some sort of party animal, drinking and dancing in a house as the Russians shelled it. and telling Traudl how much she hated Hitler's German shepherd Biondi. It is all fact based so anyone familiar with history knows the plot. Bravo for making such an ugly and real movie!",10,1,2,24 March 2006
The Wrestler," Great Movie, Great Character Study. Mickey Rourke at his Best
","Normally I despise stuff like professional wrestling and hate anything to do with New Jersey. But this movie and script is so powerful it made me respect both. Pro wrestling is a nothing more than crude slapstick pretending to be a sport. But the wrestlers have to have some athletic ability and physique, but they are more like stunt men than trapeze artists. They take a beating in those stunts as well as many have hurt themselves abusing steroids and other drugs they used to bulk up, as well as sundry recreational drug use. Also, while the cream of the WWF are quite well off, the bottom rung of the 'sport' is like Babe Ruth Baseball, they earn a couple hundred for a match in a VFW Hall on Friday then back to some miserable grind of a job next Monday.Mickey Rourke was a natural for this role. His life paralleled the Randy the Ram. The Ram is an over the hill pro wrestler who is one step away from homelessness. He lives in a trailer park, works during the week in a supermarket and does bush league local 'fights' in small venues like Legion Halls or church gyms. He has a heart attack after one gig and is warned not to continue in his trade less he may die the next time. But the time in the ring and the camaraderie with the other 'fighters' (actors) is the only thing that makes his life worth living. His social life is based on courting a stripper, Cassidy played by Marisa Tomei but he does seem to be a favorite uncle type to the kids in his trailer park.Facing his mortality, the Ram tries to mend bridges with his estranged daughter Stephanie, played by Evan Rachel Wood, fails. Even though he and the stripper seem to be soul mates, she has to spurn him out of professional etiquette of not messing with customers. They both have similar trades, providing an exaggerated act based on their masculinity/femininity to crowds of low brow gawkers, where some of them don't see it as an act and them as actors.What is beautiful about it is the three principles carry it off so well. It's an overworked charade to say that a movie is so 'real', especially in these days of 'reality' TV, but it felt that way in everything from the sets, costumes, the use of real wrestling matches and other location shots. Even the pay phones the Ram uses, since he can't even afford cell service, are located on a real deserted, abandoned railway passenger platform by an abandoned railroad tunnel and line. I had no trouble identifying and liking the characters even though they chose a life that was essentially a charade. They tried for the dream their way and failed. It was a beautiful elegy to a decent common man, no hero, without one shred of hype or Hollywood glitz.",Null,0,0,10 February 2011
Sherlock Holmes," Not Really Sherlock Holmes, More Like Norris as Bond
","This is a Guy Ritchie movie first off. If you liked 'Snatch' or 'Lock, Stock.. ', you'd probably like this one. As just a movie, it is par for a modern detective buddy kick ass movie like Lethal Weapon, dressed in Victorian garb. He is supposed to be Sherlock Holmes but he's more like Mel Gibson's Lethal Weapon's Riggs, an unstable violence dealing character, than the staid, calm, thoughtful Holmes most of us are familiar with. That part is what bothers me in all these re-imaginings ala Star Trek, where some icon is turned into a ass kicking machine full of non stop stunts & special effects. Ironically, the main saving grace is Robert Downey Jr. who did a good job bringing his dissolute but ass kicking Holmes character to life. For instance, Holmes engages in bare fisted underground boxing matches, like Pitt in 'Snatch', to raise money & stay fit. Okay, the old Holmes was no wimp, but he was not into large amounts of hacking, kicking & blasting that modern blubber heads demand from their heroes. Rachel McAdam was okay as some sort of Catwoman nemesis, accomplice and love aspect Irene Adler to Holmes. But even she was more like Alice from 'Resident Evil' than what an upper class Victorian woman would be, with her fighting skills almost on par with our dynamic duo. Jude Law played the dandified but equally bad ass Dr. Watson, with a Felix-Oscar like tension between the two heroes over Holmes-Downey's obnoxious, dissolute ways, which was funny and added some humor.Okay, there is some plot about some evil Lord Blackwood, played by the same guy who was the evil don from 'Kick-Ass', Mark Strong. He and his upper class pals are into some black magic Egyptian like Satanic cult. He mysteriously comes back from the dead, after a well deserved hanging, to terrorize London and bring his black magic cabal into power. Well the Black Lord is scaring the bejeesus out of everyone except Holmes who is dogging him and his crew through London with the seemingly unwilling help of Watson & Adler.In this, the movie reminds me of the far better 'From Hell' which featured a dissolute but far less lethal detective, played by Johnny Depp, dogging some mumbo jumbo star chamber cult that was butchering whores ala Jack the Ripper. That movie spent some time exploring the bad part of town and more intangible magical aspects, as opposed to the detailed but utterly phony CGI London in this movie, a set that never stopped crying 'High Price FAKE'.Okay, in brief, the acting made it bearable, but the perversion of such an icon, as well as the cheesy Victorian CGI set & EFX extravaganza made it lose what ever class and charm that one would expect from Sherlock Holmes.",5,1,2,31 October 2010
Prometheus," Very Big Letdown
","Okay, I expected more out of Ridley Scott and this latest installment of Aliens. So expectations lead to disappointments. If this was some low budget film by a second string director, I might have been slightly more charitable, but not much more. The movie could have been so much better with a better plot and characters.For positives, it had great sets, visuals and location shots. They also had a pretty good set of actors. Michael Fassbender as David the Android was by far the best actor role set. It also had a decent but no original pansperia, life originating from another planet, plot element. It was certainly a far better film than the execrable 'Mission to Mars' by the execrable Brian De Palma. It also floated out some intelligent ideas and concepts that weren't directly answeredBut these are the parts that made the film bite. First two men get stranded in the dig when the rest of the crew had to high tail it back to the ship when a big storm blew in. These are supposed to be a couple of wimps who got scared when they found the dead aliens' bodies. So they end up taking refuge in the creepiest chamber they found, the temple room full of black goo and those creepy vases that are supposed to contain baby aliens. So one of them sees this ugly heinous looking creature swimming in the black goo on the floor. So they start cooing at it like it was a cute golden retriever puppy, trying to pet it. Even if looked like a cute puppy, any alien life form has to be treated with the utmost care and suspicion; if for nothing else contamination. Naturally bad things happen to them. It reminds me of a cheap horror movies where the next set of victims decide to take a stroll in some dark creepy place so the slasher or monster can have an easier time killing them off.The worst part was when after David the android got one of the aliens implanted into our lead Scientist, Elizabeth Shaw. She gets away and gets in some auto surgery medical pod to get this terrible thing removed. So the machine gets it out of her. And she immediately gets dressed and goes to confront the mission leader, Meredith Vickers. She doesn't tell anyone about this horrible incident and horrible creature, which she left partially neutralized inside the medical pod. I mean after such a horrific event, if some one wasn't struck down by shock, they would at least tell some one, especially the mission leader and ship's captain. Okay, part of the plot was that the people involved were not unified and many had their own agenda. But Shaw was the de facto leader of the expedition. Later on, that monster, without eating anything, managed to grow in size about a 100 fold in less than a day.I don't mind a movie recycling past elements, but from other movies, like the Fifield into the man-spider thing like from the Carpenter's 'The Thing'. There were just too many dumb characters, dumb moves, like trying to run from a ring shaped ship that is rolling on its side like a wheel by running down the track it is bound to roll on instead of cutting to one side or the other. We deserved better and Sir Scott let us down",4,3,6,20 November 2012
Signs," Has It's Faults and Plot Holes But Still Worthwhile
","The alien invasion movie is the oldest but best draw in basic sci fi movies, so MNS's take on this shopworn plot gets some pluses for originality. He is the type of guy who is so earnest and such a good filmmaker that you can enjoy this movie even though parts of it are just plain dumb like schmaltzy sentimental fatherly monologues about his children's' birth during the scariest part of the movie. There were enough and incessant Christian and spiritual references to fill 2 months of sermons with near idolatry of the preacher's dead wife thrown in for a Mary hail. But the lamest part of the movie were the aliens: the weakest, most incompetent bunch of losers to ever build interstellar ships and invade earth. The Boy Scouts could have driven them off. But it was scary in parts, as well as thoughtful, almost too thoughtful. It was fun seeing Mel play a introverted, non heroic sort of family guy, not the demented kill them all father he played in 'The Patriot' or 'Braveheart' or a 100 other ones. The best actor was Rory Culkin playing his young son, who is much better than his more famous but obnoxious brother, The daughter, precocious 6 year old Boo, was played well by a wee actress named Abigail Breslin. While young actresses & actors are natural scene stealers, she was precious and enjoyable. Certainly better than that screechy obnoxious pre-teen monster Dakota Fanning played in the latest version of 'War of the World'. In that movie the main disappointment was not having both kids killed off for their general useless bratty behavior in a time of extreme danger and emergency. One more note, if you are looking for special effects there are next to none. There are no fancy ships, death rays or mass death and destruction.",5,3,6,12 November 2009
Sin City," Style over Substance, Gore, Violence, Corruption & Cynicism for Their Own Sake
","First off, I am no fan of Frank Miller, but I imagine most of the ravers for this film are. Okay, I can understand when a 'writer' gets his 'book' made into a film, his fans cheer regardless. 2nd, I like Rodriguez, he is a technically good fun director of clever action films. But Rodriguez is an acolyte of the king of cult gore, cynicism, pop culture exploitation and excess himself, he who must not be named.But this film can't be a great, or even a good film in my estimation. There was nothing beautiful about it, in it's ugly setting of a worn out industrial city. Someone rendering comic book panels to story board drawings into film via green screen is not art, but mere technical work. It was ugly scenery, ugly people, ugly plots, tons of gratuitous violence, dialog that can only be described as a parody of noir genre. The actors were good, since they had the money & influence to get talent, but all for naught. There were no interesting lessons, exotic locations, fascinating plots or even a hint of moral lesson beyond it is up to damaged but good people to mercilessly exterminate evil ones. Revenge 101.Watching documentary movie reels of Nazi and other totalitarian atrocities may have a guiginol appeal to people, but they are not entertainment, but they serve as a moral lesson about following evil political/religious faiths to their final horrible ends. Or even atomic bomb and firestorm damage to Axis cities serve as an example of better countries who resorted to horrible means to destroy worse ones. But this had none of that. We don't get just pedophile priests here, but cannibal ones. The corruption, nihilism & evil here were almost childishly displayed as the cynicism was dime store; whores of the heart of gold variety are as cliché as they get.There is no scene, plot point or character here that I haven't seen before in a more real & human setting. It is just pure sleaze & violence to the point of just being vile.",3,1,2,18 December 2011
Goodfellas," Utterly Guilty Pleasure, Like Cheesecake, Keep Away from Kids
","First off, this is really a well made movie, with Martin Scorcese's bringing to life all the hoodlum midlifes and lowlifes he knows so well. The cast is A1, and includes all the usually suspects like Sorvino, Liotta, DENIRO, Pesci, and future Soprano's luminaries like Lorraine Bracco, Mike Imperioli, Tony Sirico, Vincent Pastore, as well as Eugene Levy and Sam Jackson. I mention SOPRANOS boldly cause this movie definitely is the template for the Sopranos and other revisionist mob comedy/dramas.It chronicles the real life exploits of Henry Hill, a mobster who ratted out his pals in Queens and became a notorious witness protection screw up, then cashed on on his criminal/mob past with his books and this movie, So in all the murder, racketeering and mayhem he was an accomplice, though it is tempered by Liotta, with a great 'nice bad guy' act. Paul Sorvino, as Pauli, is the template for all mob boss types, who shuffles around grilling sausages while commanding his little crime fief.Here is the problem. Unlike the 'Godfather' series, which almost canonizing the mobsters with old world grandeur, this movie is upfront that these mobsters are greedy bullies, just out to have a good time. They are fun loving party animals who threaten to kill the club owner they suck off of as he tries to collect the tab from Tommy DeVito, the fun loving murderous little psychopath that made Joe Pesci a household name, and his character niche. That's the problem, the movie glorifies gangster life and is a media 'pimp ride' for a killer hood like real life Henry Hill. It's more than a morally dubious movie. Even 'Clockwork Orange' which was banned in England with the help of Stanley Kubrick, was more of a morality play than this. Without belaboring the point, since Scorcese is such a good film maker, he puts a glam spin on these real life people who should be swinging from the gallows, not serving as role models for a growing psychopath. That is why I only gave it a 6, it deserves a 9.5 by most 'normal' movie scales. It is funny, dramatic and always interesting. The music, the good hits of the time mirroring Hill's career from the late 40's to the late 70'sis a great melding of pop culture. It is almost uproariously funny. I only recommend this to mature adults, which excludes about half the country.",6,2,9,12 December 2006
V for Vendetta," Pulp Political Posturing, Just an Overgrown Comic Book
","OK, with the budget, crew and actors, it was well made, no doubt top shelf UK production on a technical side. But as a political parable it just sucked. It mixed modern left leaning tropes about 9/11 Truther nonsense about the government staging false terrorist attacks to gain power with some straw man right wing Xtians as the all around bad guys. It had John Hurt as the erstwhile dictator, just like those other movies where he played some 30s style dictator or subject of one. I am no fan of the Xtain right here in the US, and while this film was made in the age of Bush, I also found the insinuation that those backwards moralizing phonies, fundamentalists & geeks are really blood thirsty tyrants to be too much of a stretch, considering NONE of those 30s style dictators were vary religious, with the exception of Franco, who was the least insidious of that crew.Also, the typical one man army concept, our V, who can kick ass and slash 100s of armed opponents is so freaking stupid & stale, it deserves to be knocked flat on that count alone. He also seems to have unlimited resources, like the money and cut outs needed to mail 8 million Guy Fawkes masks to random people, and access to all sorts of explosives & public buildings etc. that any totalitarian police state worth its salt would detect in less than a month. There is no subtlety. A gay TV personality played by Stephen Fry, a friend of our put upon heroine, makes some lame TV satire of the terrorist and exalted leader. For this you'd expect him to be maybe fired and exiled unless he recants, but the evil leader has him killed in front of the cowering heroine, who was hiding in his house.Finally, as proof of stupidity masking as the profound, Guy Fawkes, the 17th Century Catholic who tried to blow up Parliament with barrels of gunpowder, is the proto hero and the inspiration for our un-named V, who wears a Guy Fawkes mask throughout the movie as more than a disguise. To English people this is known as the Gunpowder Plot and its thwarting is celebrated as Guy Fawkes Day. Well, weren't the Catholics back then the religious zealots who were trying to get England back in the Roman Catholic Church fold? For a movie that pans Christian fascism and exalts freedom, it would be like having whores and strippers march for chastity. So much for comic book politics!",4,14,28,8 October 2010
