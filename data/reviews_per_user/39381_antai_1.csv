Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Determined to make justice to this movie!
","I do love this movie. This movie actually confirmed my starwarsfanism, I love the old ones too, and I think that this one is very very good , although many people disagree. Of course is not like the old trilogy!...it is not supposed to be. This movie is made for this generation, it would have been silly to repeat the same format the other movies had 20 years later. Concerning the movie itself, I think the acting is very good FOR A STARWARS MOVIE, we have to realize that acting direction is not one of G. Lucas'es strongest points, but it doesn't suck at all (just check the quality of actors),although I do think there are  quite a lot of corny moments in this trilogy that are not necessary. About the story, we have to realize it's part of a saga and being the first sequel, it exposes the main players and situations. The special, visual effects and look are just amazing, revolutionary and very well done. That's concerning the movie,...and about what people don't like, for example Jar-Jar, we adult fans have to realize that this movie is for kids too, and kids need a funny, silly character to like. I mean,really, how different is Jar-Jar from 3PO of Ep IV? I just think that older fans that grew up with the classic trilogy feel too overprotective and do not realize that they were young impressionable kids , when they first watched star wars. I recommend trying to watch the new prequels with a little bit of kid mentality, understanding that they're not intended to be the same as the old ones and always remembering it is a Starwars movie after all.",9,1,2,20 August 2003
