Ford v Ferrari," Le Mans 66 fantastic for a 24hr fan
","Having just stepped out of an advanced screening of le Mans 66 or Ford vs Ferrari if you prefer, I was really looking forward to this film and I wasn't disappointed. As a fan of the 24hr race I found the racing scenes to be heart pounding, adrenalin pumping and visually breathtaking. The core performances from Bale as Ken Miles and Damon as Carroll Shelby really sold the film to me as a couple of die hard car fanatics with a complicated friendship put together beautifully by James Mangold in the big chair. It's not just thrills either. There are genuinely touching moments in this film with a great supporting cast and a great villain in Enzo Ferrari. I loved it and if you have an interest in the source material you won't find a better petrol fuelled film this year. SA",8,15,40,4 November 2019
Knives Out," I suspect foul play
","Really enjoyed the film. great cast, great characters. Nice plot twists novel approach. Masterfully directed, well edited giving all the ensemble characters they can get their teeth into. What starts as a simple murder mystery soon turns when us as viewers get all the information we need right at the start of the film.
Spoilers bit, sorry;üôè
I did think it was a bit heavy handed the way none of the family knew the country Marta was from leading us to the fact although they keep telling her she is part of the family very few know even the most basic details about her life.
Over all I thought it was a fantastic ride, go see it, enjoy it and avoid the haters. Cheers.",8,4,14,25 November 2019
