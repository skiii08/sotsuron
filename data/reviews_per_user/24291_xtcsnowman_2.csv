Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," A brilliant all-action Victorian adventure !
","Having enjoyed the first Guy Ritchie Sherlock Holmes adventure and having read all the Conan Doyle stories in the past, I was of course looking forward to the next Ritchie instalment with bated breath. And I'm glad to say that I wasn't disappointed.From the first scenes, the game was afoot. And with not a spare second to dip into your popcorn tub, you're taken on a roller-coaster ride through the darkest depths of Victorian London and pre WW1 Europe, where you get to marvel in some superb set pieces, eye catching special effects and deliciously quirky characterisations.On the downside, the plot is a little slight in substance, and the rather irritating fashion to cram in as many 'dark' scenes as possible (ie night shots, or rooms with no lights etc), can be a little annoying at times. I also thought Jude Laws Watson was a little bland and a let-down in comparison to Downey Jrs all out, take no prisoners characterisation of Holmes. These are only small gripes however, as the film overall is a thoroughly enjoyable romp that will earn a few repeat views in the fullness of time.In addition to the spectacular sets, special effects and performance by Downey Jnr as mentioned above, Stephen Fry was excellent and a good choice for Mycroft, and I thought Jared Harris' performance as Professor Moriaty had a nice underlying evilness about it. I also thought the Holmes' fun 'interior' chameleon disguises were great fun and very original.All in all then, an excellent period adventure film and well worth two hours of anyone's time. Roll on the next instalment.",8,1,2,17 April 2012
Hugo," An OK film that could have been so much better !
","I waited a while before i watched Hugo and I must say overall I was disappointed. I had seen all the written plaudits beforehand, the Oscar and BAFTA nominations etc and the premise seemed to be a good one. However, when it came to the film itself, I had to wonder at times if I was watching the same film as everybody else. Throwing together a great director, some good special effects and a good story, does not a great movie make ! OK so the story was OK, the effects were pretty good, but thats where the plus points really have to end. Some incredibly poor 'stage school' children 'acting' and an incredibly annoying, hammy and over the top 'performance' from Sasha Baron Cohen left me feeling that the chance to make a really great film here had been wasted.Brilliant acting talent like Richard Griffiths, Ray Winstone and Frances De La Tour seem to have been given nondescript parts simply to try and make the film play more credible to the British movie going public. The one acting highlight being Ben Kingsley, as always and in a way the better subject and focus for the movie. What a pity his character wasn't the focal point, with a few tweaks of the story the children could easily have been dispensed with.Having said all of that, there were some nice moments, some clever little touches and some nice inter meshing of truth and fairy tale. And with that all important 'feel good' factor at the end, I can sort of see why some people thought this was a 10 out of 10 film. Sadly however, not me.",5,2,4,14 April 2012
