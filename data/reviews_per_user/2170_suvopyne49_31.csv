The King's Speech," King's speech will leave you speechless
","The movie deserves all the accolades and plaudits that it's getting right now. The way Tom Hooper have depicted the royal saga, is very enchanting. The Duke of York, Prince Albert (Colin Firth) stammers whenever he speaks, and the stammering gets worse when he addresses his subjects. After trying every bit of means he tells his wife, the Duchess (Helena Bonham Carter) to stop consulting people for the cure of his stammering. As a last resort Duchess tries a speech therapist, Lionel Logue(Geoffrey Rush), whose methods are quite unorthodox. The movie shows both the complications, that Duke of York faces with hindrance in his speaking and the family problem involving his elder brother.Absolutely speechless is the performance of Colin Firth. He shows all the aspects of the character with a touch of genius. He portrays both the helplessness and the royal steeliness in the character with equal brilliance. Geoffrey rush literally complements Firth's acting. All of the above which is said about Firth can be said about him too. The same goes for Helena Bonham Carter. Michael Gambon, Timothy Spall, Derek Jacobi and Guy Pearce all do justice to their parts.Tom Hooper's direction is flawless. It takes one to the Royal family, where one feel pretty royal themselves. The cinematography(Danny Cohen) has a part to play there.The music is according and soothing",10,0,0,14 April 2011
Finding Neverland," Excellent Movie - Broadened Imagination
","Marc Forster deserves all the credits and plaudits for making such a beautiful movie. It could have won the academy award for best film which it lost to Million Dollar baby.Set upon nineteenth century, the movie is about a married playwriter who struggles to impress the critics and when he meets a widow and her four sons he took a liking to the boys and started playing with them by broadening their imagination. And gradually he finds a great plot for his play.Johnny Depp could have easily won the Oscar too ( which he lost to Jamie Foxx for 'Ray'). Kate Winslet is also at her best. Dustin Hoffman and Julie Christie plays their respective roles brilliantly.The movie is unimaginatively wonderful.",10,2,2,19 January 2011
127 Hours," Inspirational one by Danny Boyle .. better than 'Slumdog'
","After that over-hyped (at least to me) Slumdog Millionaire , Danny Boyle's latest movie on climber Aron Ralston's autobiography 'Between a Rock and Hard Place' is a far more superior and great movie. The movie is about an adventure of mountain climber Aron Ralston(James Franco), which badly goes wrong. He gets trapped in crack of great canyon under a boulder which badly pinches his right hand to the rock wall and the situation became nigh impossible to free that hand out. Then Aron has to spent almost 5 days in that hole with very limited resource, the movie travels through Aron's various emotions and futile attempt to get rescued.The movie is all about Aron and thus the performance belongs to James Franco. He is brilliant through-out the movie and specially in the scene where he records a mock talk show featuring himself in his video camera.A.R.Rahman's music is also quite good ( though not one of his greatest).Overall it's an inspirational movie and definitely a well deserved Oscar nomination for this movie.",10,3,6,16 February 2011
Midnight in Paris," Beautiful Paris
","Paris never looked more beautiful and colourful to me (As if I have been there). Still, one has to appreciate the way Woody Allen captured the city and by doing so enraptured the viewers. The opening montage was so beautiful that one cannot help but agree with Gil Pender's (Owen Wilson) decision of moving there. At the start of the movie, we see our protagonist in a dilemma. The dilemma, then, seemed to be between choosing two cities, hence two lifestyles. But it was eventually between doing what one want to do, to create something which they strive for, and to accept other's opinions and have a relatively simpler life. Woody Allen created this perspective of Gil Pender, along with the romantic angle of course. This, I believe, is what Allen is master at. The blending of romance and fantasy is fantastic. The story is simple. Pender, after a disappointed evening with his wife and her pseudo-intellectual friends, wanders in the street of Paris and at midnight gets picked up by a couple of people who turns out to be from the 1920s, the Golden Age where Pender always wanted to be and live life. There he meets his literature and art idols. The story gets unfolded in an engaging way.The performances are appropriate and good, as one expects from an ensemble like this. I really liked Owen Wilson's performance here. He managed to reflect the innocence of his character quite well. Rachel McAdams depicted her character's superficiality well; Michael Sheen, always a fine actor, portrayed his character with finesse. All the cameos in different timezone by various actors were great, especially Adrien Brody's, Kathy Bates' and Corey Stoll's ones. But it was Marion Cotillard who gorgeously shone in her character.The cinematography and Art Direction deserves all the accolades and plaudits too, especially the way it helped to create the golden age of literature.",9,1,2,9 January 2012
Zodiac," Nice Thriller - A bit long though
","Another David Fincher suspense Thriller, almost like se7en. But it's based on Robert Graysmith's book 'Zodiac' which in turn is based on true events and came files in police reports and also some facts which Mr. Graysmith himself investigated.the movie's story is about a serial killer who killed many people in California region in late 60's. and how the detectives trying to track down zodiac amidst a lot of confusion.The performances are good. Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards is really good as two detectives. Robert Downey jr. is really in his charming best. Sad he doesn't really appear in the later half of the movie . Jake Gyllenhall, as the main protagonist 'Graysmith', is good. And the main who played 'Leigh Allen', the main suspect to be the 'zodiac', is really good in the scene where he is interrogated.The movie is a bit long, and as it based on true events, the ending isn't exact. That is to be said that it wasn't shown who is the 'Zodiac' exactly.",9,0,0,26 January 2011
The Prestige," No Spoiler
","This was the only movie of Christopher Nolan which was yet to watch for me.. It's a wonderful movie.. Though it's rated below Nolan's some other works, but i find it really good, as good as the likes of dark knight and inception if not better .The movie revolves around the rivalry between two magician , set upon nineteenth century, Nolan shown that era quite wonderfully ..And like almost all Nolan movies, it has an mind jolting ending. and so many twists and turns :)Performance is eqaully good from both hugh jackman and Christian bale as the two rival magician. And the ladies haven't got much to do but rebecca hall and scarlett johansson does well .. and o'course michael caine , as always in all the Nolan movies (batman series and inception) excelled in his small but significant role. lastly i just wanna say 'Are u watching Closely? ' ;)",10,0,1,11 January 2011
The Town," The Town - Heist movie at their best and one o'the finest Ensemble
","Ben Affleck's The Town is a superb crime thriller. The movie is directed and also co-written by Ben Affleck, and it has a lot of good actors in the ensemble cast.With a great opening scene of bank robbing, the movie starts well. The movie is about the people of the town of a boston suberbs called Charlestown, which is shown as the breeding ground for bank robbers and drug dealers. Doug Macray and Jem Coughlin and their gang pull off a bank heist and also take the manager, Claire as hostage, and also release her later. Later they finds that Claire lives in their own Charlestown and Doug decides to follow her when she was already contacted by FBI. The story revolves as it shows Doug's life and his feelings towards Claire and also their other tasks( robbing o'course).Ben Affleck, himself, as Doug Macray manages to pull off an excellent performance, so does Rebecca Hall as Claire. But the movie's stand-out performance belongs to Jeremy Renner and Jon Hamm as Jem Coughlin and FBI officer Frawley respectively. Jeremy Renner, ( after a superb performance in 'The Hurt Locker') as the brutal and a little eccentric criminal, is fantastic. Very well deserved Best supporting Actor Academy Award nomination. Blake Lively as Jem's sister is sexy just as well as brilliant, and one have to mention Chris Cooper as Doug's father in only one scene, just great to watch.Thumbs up for this one and highly recommended.",9,0,1,19 February 2011
Gone Baby Gone," Wonderful movie, one of the bests.
","I watched Ben Affleck's 'The Town' last year, and I was quite moved. Ben Affleck's directorial capabilities had me enthralled. His directorial debut is equally good if not better. The thing which I love about Ben Affleck's direction is how he manages to bring the best out of a city. I mean, after watching 'Gone Baby Gone' and 'The Town', Boston no longer seems an unfamiliar city to me. Such is the impact of Affleck's direction. The movie is of the crime/thriller genre. But it grew out of 'being just a suspense thriller'. It handles a very sensitive issue in a complete and justified manner. The movie is about two private investigators, hired to investigate the case of a missing child. As the story progresses, the turn of event slowly occurs in an intriguing and surprising manner. The movie has every element which a thriller should have. But certainly the main feature of the movie is the blend between all those twists and turns and lives of quite a few people, especially those who live at this city. Ben Affleck cast his brother Casey to play the role of the main protagonist. Casey, as Patrick Kenzie, is superb. His character is pretty much reserved but also has a certain steeliness about him too. He showed this steeliness, especially at the climax. He said those dialogues in such a manner that audiences would get convinced that he was doing the right thing. Michelle Monaghan, as his partner and girlfriend, did justice to her role. Amy Ryan, as the missing girl's grieving mother who is also drug addicted, was a class act. She handled the transient nature of her character beautifully. Morgan Freeman had little scope and he did well with that little screen-time. But one, sure, needs to mention Ed Harris as Remy Bressant, the police detective. His performance, especially in the scene where he was drunk and talked about 'planting evidence', was remarkable. In the end, the movie stands tall because, it shows that a man should do what he feels right, no matter what everyone thinks. Patrick lives with his decision, even though that might be a wrong decision. This sort of movies always remains vivid in memory, even after the credits gets rolled. Another thing about the movie is the music. I can hardly remember a background score which was not good or not suitable. Harry- William Gregson, surely, is a genius. From the opening score to the end, the background scores played their parts to keep the charm of the movie in tact.",10,0,1,3 October 2011
Incendies," Emotionally Exhausting Experience
","Incendies belongs to that rare breed of films that induce a tumultuous surge of emotions in its spectators while engaging them through the narrative. Jerry Seinfeld once said in his show Seinfeld, to add to the humor of that show undoubtedly, that Leo Tolstoy wanted to name his novel 'War: What Is It Good For' instead of 'War and Peace'. Maybe that rhetorical question of a book title would have been an apt tagline for what was portrayed in this film.What sets Dennis Villeneuve's 'Incendies' apart from other films with post-war trauma as their underlying theme, is the spectrum of human relationship he constructed on the screen. The film starts with twin brother and sister, Jeanne and Simon, receiving their recently deceased mother, Nawal's funeral wishes; wishes that need to be fulfilled, before the children can proceed with the burial. In two different letters, the twins were asked to locate their father and half-brother, who we would later find was called Nihad. With initial reluctance and refusal from her foreboding brother, Jeanne finally set upon the journey that would uncover the truth through several different realisations, taking the audience with it.In Incendies, Villeneuve never loses the grip that he gets to hold from the very first few minutes. The narrative had the mother and daughter tracing the same path in a Middle-Eastern country, only with different perspectives and scenarios. The civil war, that was shown here to have its inflictions on the protagonists, can be compared with the Lebanese Civil War. The places that had horrific memories for the mother are visited by the daughter. Thus, blending the two timelines in the narrative, a sense of déjà vu is channeled in the film. At one point, viewers along with Jeanne would be forced to ponder whether being oblivious to the truth was a blessing or not.If the screenplay is the heart of the film, then the oxygen was provided by the cast to keep it pumping. Lubina Azabal's Nawal Marwan is tremendous feat in acting. It was important for her performance to be in accordance with the story, with she being the protagonist in this tempestuous journey of a film. Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin as Jeanne, was not far behind either. Apart from these stand-out performances, the film is bolstered with performances from the rest of the cast akin to that of a neo-realist film.Incendies is as intense and brutal as one can get. Nothing hits harder than the truth that comes out of nowhere and you do not want to hear. Incendies is quite an achievement at that. It becomes incessantly difficult to revisit the first scene where Nihad, a child, would leave you with self-judgment and introspection. Radiohead's 'You and Whose Army' adds to the cause.",9,2,5,5 September 2014
In the Name of the Father," No less great than 'The Shawshank Redemption'
","Some times you watch a movie and tell yourself 'Why I haven't seen this movie before?'. This is exactly that kind of a movie. The movie is said to be a bit blurred in historical accuracies. Probably, that is the reason the movie is a bit underrated. The things that make this movie a winner is its simple yet strong story and immeasurably powerful performances. The movie is about Gerry Conlon and his three friends, the team of whom was later christened as the 'Guildford Four'. They were falsely accused of bombing and killing. This was followed by multiple arrests, including those of Gerry's Aunt and Father, Giuseppe. Full credit to Jim Sheridan for handling the plot in an appropriate way by following a linear narrative. It is the credit of the director for showing the unique bond between Gerry and Giuseppe, which I am quite sure can be related by any father-son pair. About performances; when there is Daniel Day Lewis, as Gerry, there will be impeccable and majestic acting. I always fall short of adjectives when I talk about Day-Lewis' acting. Be that when he got the news of his father's death or in the climax or any other single scene featuring him, he excelled. Pete Poslethwaithe was also brilliant as Giuseppe and got matched Day-Lewis' acting. Emma Thompson, always a fantastic actress, didn't disappoint and was excellent especially in the last climax courtroom scene. Special mention to Don Baker as Joe McAndrew.As a final note this is a movie which, as its fantastic soundtrack 'In the Name of the Father' by U2 indicates, tells a story about love,humanity and fighting for truth and those make this movie no less great than The Shawshank Redemption.",10,2,4,17 December 2011
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," A great watch - visual treat and also a nice cinematic experience
","Well, the first thing of this movie which will capture your fascination is the cinematography of this movie (Thanks to Roger Deakins). The landscapes, set upon Eighteenth Century are shown brilliantly in the movie. The movie depicts the life of legendary American gang-leader and robber Jesse James(Brad Pitt) . It also tells the story of Jesse James' killer Robert Ford (Casey Affleck) parallelly. More than showing the robberies, that had been pulled off by James gang, the movie shows more of the life of Jesse James and his gang members too which includes Robert Ford too.Brad Pitt is great as Jesse James. As I have started to watch more of his movies, I am finding the versatility in his acting. At first, he doesn't speak much but he says all with his eyes. He portrayed Jesse James to the character's fullest aspects, so that sometimes one really hates the character, and sometimes feels for Jesse and loves him. Now, Casey Affleck is the one to watch out for, in this movie. He was in one word 'Superb' as the 'Coward' Robert Ford. One cannot help but appreciate and applause the way he portryed the 'Cowardice'. Sam Rockwell, Jeremy Renner and Paul Schneider does justice to their respective characters too.Nick Cave's music is great. Specially the main theme, 'Ballad for Jesse James' is really soulful and melancholic at the same time.",9,0,0,3 April 2011
The Pianist," Brillian portrayal of the brutality of the Nazis
","Roman Polanski's take on the infamous Nazi Torture on the Jews is fascinating and enthralling. It is based on the autobiography of the same name by Wladyslaw Szpilman. The movie is based on the survival journey of a Jew Pianist, Szpilman, during the horrible times of World War-II.Credit has to be given to the director for portraying the brutality of the Nazi Germans with impeccable perfection. If anyone requires any justification of the Basterds' cruel works against Nazis in Quentin Tarantino's 'Inglourious Basterds' , then this is the movie which provides it. Basically this movie is shown from the eyes of a common Jew whose life drastically changed due to the Germans' invasion in Poland.Though there are many side-characters, but there is only main character; and that is Szpilman. Adrien Brody does full justification to my expectation from him in this movie. I expected him to be better than Daniel-Day-Lewis in 'Gangs of New-York' and Jack Nicholson in 'About Schmidt' as he have beaten both of them to win the Oscar of best actor. So if I say he fulfills my expectation - that says a lot.Roman Polanski's direction is brilliant, so is the musical notes of the piano used in the movie. Thomas Kretschmann did a good cameo sort of performance too.",10,0,0,25 June 2011
Room," Evocative Filmmaking
","Lenny Abrahamson's Room is poignant. Room is evocative. Room is devastatingly beautiful. There is a magic in creating a world in a child's perspective. To capture and display the innocence, the purity, the sheer amount of confusing vastness of the world is no mean feat. Writer Emma Donoghue, who is also the writer of the book that the film is based upon, and director Lenny Abrahamson manage to do just that.The film starts with the pair of mother and son, Joy and Jack, played by Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay living their lives while scrapping for resources yet finding solace in each other's company, in a room. That is right. In a single room (which later revealed to be a garden shed with a skylight as the only source of sun). The reason behind this ordeal revealed to be that Joy had been abducted by person referred only as 'Old Nick'. Old Nick kept Joy and Jack, who is his biological son, sans any means of communication with the outside world and had them live a life devoid of any hope to go back to the world.Without revealing much about what happens next in the film, it can be said that what follows is one of the heart-wrenching and heart-warming story about love, innocence and those little joys of the world that we often overlook. There is a slight tonal shift in the second half as the tension of escape and sweetness of the love between mother and son gets replaced with Joy facing the reality of the world. But the change is in coherence with the story and that helped in underlining the difficulty both protagonists, especially Joy, is facing in their new world. Even without reading the book, I must say that the screenplay immensely helped in establishing the dichotomy of the emotions that the protagonists went through. Lenny Abrahamson's direction complemented that aforementioned dichotomy. The first act was shot quite meticulously in the closed room, thus providing a sense of foreboding and an urge for escape.Although bolstered by a good support cast the film largely centers around the mother, played by Brie Larson and the son, played by Jacob Tremblay. Brie Larson, whose hitherto best performance perhaps had been in the largely underrated 2013 film Short Term 12, churned out a superlative and breathtaking performance as the mother. The role was a delight for an actor of her capability and she made the character her own. Restrained and gritty while being captive in the room and yet lovingly playing with her son; Vulnerable and fragile, being captive of her own thoughts and insecurities, while trying to get her son attuned to the big world; Brie Larson shines throughout her role.But, the film would not have been so pure, so emotional, so magical without the brilliant performance of Jacob Tremblay, as the 5 year old. It is one of the finest performances from a child I have ever seen. The fear of the task her mother asked, then the taste of freedom, then again the intimidation of the vast world that had hitherto been unknown to him. We feel everything through the wondrous performance of Jacob Tremblay and he genuinely smiled in the film when seeing a 'real' dog for the first time, it becomes difficult to hold tears back.At this point, it would not be fair if Stephen Rennick's score is not mentioned. The music, with the appropriate usage, bolstered the scenes and helped the film in taking the audience for the ride.Room is a film that would provide its audiences a perspective that we often ignore; and for this very reason it is a film that should not be missed.",9,0,3,3 March 2016
The Game," Expected end in an unexpected way
","It is another David Fincher thriller. There is one thing about all these David Fincher thrillers; they all hit the bulls-eye to give the viewers a roller-coaster ride in terms of thrill and suspense. Nicholas Van Orton is an investment banker, who is super successful when it comes to making money. But he is alone, and he does not mind himself getting alienated from most of the people including his wife and brother, Conrad. His luxurious, routine and also boring life took a drastic turn when he enrolled himself in a 'game',which was given to him by Conrad as a Birthday gift.From that moment, the movie revolves to show erroneous events occurring. Even though one can expect or predict the end, but they certainly can't expect or predict the 'way' it comes to that expected end. Michael Douglas as Nicholas is great and delivers a good performance. Sean Penn, as Conrad is also according and just. Credits to David Fincher for keeping the suspense unaltered throughout the movie. Watch this one, and you will have a great time.",8,1,2,2 July 2011
The Illusionist," Entertaining Stuff
","This one, Directed by Neil Burger, is a real good thriller movie, with really high class Art-Direction and packed with well crafted performances.Though it's a thriller, the plot is based on a typical 'poor-boy-and-rich-girl-falling-for-each-other' love story. The Story moves on, with the boy leaving the country and then emerging again with an alias name (Eisenheim The Illusionist) and wonderful skill of creating illusion. There he finds his old love (Duchess von Teschen), and also finds that she is going to marry the current Crown Prince.The movie shows some of the greatest magic tricks in a stylish manner. As I mentioned earlier , the art direction and the way ,city Vienna is shown , is really some enchanting stuff.Edward Norton has always been one of my favourite actors, and he don't disappoint, along with Jessica Biel. Paul Giamatti is also a class of his own as the chief police inspector, but it's Rufus Sewell, as Prince Leopold, who mesmerizes the most.Only at the end one may find the movie a little predictable , so some of the twists in the story may be a little less fascinating. Also, as not every trick's mechanism is shown , somehow some of the Illusion seems to be unreal.But it's still a good watch.",8,2,2,17 March 2011
Children of Men," Great story shown in a crafty camera-work.
","I first watched Alfonso Cuaron's direction in the third movie of Harry Potter, Prisoner of Azkaban. I was deeply impressed by his direction skills. This movie reflects the brilliance in him. Set upon a futuristic world of 2027, where the fertility of human is under question and no human baby had born for the past decades or some, the movie shows a person's grit to escort the last hope of mankind, a pregnant teenager to a safe place known as 'Human Project'. The movie and the events portrayed in it revolves around a futuristic England where fascism has cropped up and expanding it's roots. Clive Owen is very good as a former activist, having trouble in his personal life and then bestowed with the job of saving the pregnant girl from people who would have used her as some political bait; and Michael Caine can never cease to amaze us.Another aspect of the movie is its cinematography and the camera work. Not for once one can dare to look elsewhere, such is the quality of the cinematography in this movie. The bewilderment of why they chose David Yates to direct HP series over Cuaron keeps increasing.",Null,1,6,14 July 2011
Donnie Brasco," Two great actors - Complementing each other
","Well, when two of the greatest actors come together , it has to be something worth remembering. Donnie Brasco is a story about a FBI undercover agent Joe Pistone , who infiltrated the mafia family under the alias name 'Donnie Brasco' , and steadily he realises that Donnie Brasco is what he wants to be , in order to keep his best friend 'Lefty' alive .As i have mentioned earlier that the movie shows the great chemistry between 2 great actors, Al Pacino and Johnny Depp, so we see superlative performances from Johnny Depp as 'Donnie' and Al Pacino as 'Lefty' . It was one of those rare occasion when, two great actors appear together and they stood out with complementing each other's performance. Al Pacino's scene in the car in the climax with he pointing a gun in his own head and at the end of the movie, where Joe(Depp) receives medal for his work, the expression on Johnny Depp's face, those were some examples. Though the movie belongs to these 2 actors, but one couldn't help but praise highly the performance of Michael Madsen as Sonny Black. Mike Newell's Direction is just about brilliant and according. Sometime it becomes hard to maintain the pace of a movie, especially if it's mafia one, but Newell does a good job.Thumbs up for this one.",9,2,3,27 February 2011
The Hangover Part II," A reminiscent of the first part - not a 'Classic'
","To be very honest this installment of Hangover is reminiscent of its predecessor. It's kind of a tribute to the first part, and both consequently and sadly lacks any kind of creativity. There is hardly anything new in this movie.Phil, Doug and Alan went to Thailand for Stu's wedding, and predictably got drunk and then our story starts. They woke up in a god-forsaken place , and then starts the journey to retrace their previous night's activities to find their friend (This time it's not Doug).The awesome threesome of Phil, Stu and Alan is still great to watch. Phil's charismatic presence and tries of making the situation stable, Stu's hysteria and Alan's brilliant dumbness will still keep you hooked in this one.Though,quite a lot of the scenes and consequently the humor is taken from the part I. Especially the last ending scene. That was way to predictable and one can say a complete rip-off from the predecessor.There's nothing new for the ones who have watched the old 1st part. But there's still some funny one-liners and the movie undeniably enjoyable. Only don't get your hopes too high for this one because of the super 'The Hangover'.",7,0,2,31 May 2011
Prisoners," Thriller that will well and truly keep you thrilled
","Narrative that follows the 'whodunnit' approach often relies on the climactic twist. Herein lies the craftsmanship of the filmmaker to keep you on the edge even if there is nothing but a simple conversation is going on the screen. You can feel the Hitchcockian bomb is there somewhere. David Fincher showed us how to hold the suspense throughout the film in his early works. Dennis Villeneuve here pretty much did a similarly splendid job.Two families see their worlds go upside down, when their two very young daughters go missing, presumably abducted. When the adept detective has to let the primary suspect go, due to lack of evidences, the father of one child takes it to himself to find the daughters. Sounds familiar? Yes, the premise is quite similar to that of a Mystic River or a Zodiac.But, the defining feature of this film would be that, every now and then it justifies its title and asks you question about who the real prisoner is. For it is us who put ourselves in the most impregnable prisons. As we see the father, Keller (Hugh Jackman) shredding his values one by one; the obsession, the pain are felt by the audience.Like mentioned earlier, it is one thing to build a premise that promises suspense; and, I am going a bit Jerry Seinfeld way here, it is a different thing altogether to 'hold' the suspense throughout the film. Credit goes to Aaron Guzikowski for the always-engaging and compelling script. Villeneuve hardly mismatches the pace of the story or loses the grip in the screenplay. Some might disagree, but I think the plot is divided in two sub-plots. One that follows the premise where the detective Loki, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, relentlessly pursues the kidnapper. The other is where Keller is the protagonist; that always makes us wonder how far people can go for the love of family.When you get a cast like the one this film has, you get the chance to explore various ranges of emotion and actually get to build characters, which is not very regular in typical thriller films. The support cast was stellar with the likes of Maria Bello, Terrence Howard, Viola Davies, the astonishingly refrained Melissa Leo and Paul Dano, who not surprisingly revels in his almost-silent, reserved character. Each one of them showing their acting prowess in turns. But, it is the leads that will sweep off your feet with their performances. Both Jackman and Gyllenhaal give knock-out performances as theirs were the more layered characters in the film.The final punch of the film comes from Johann Johannsson's haunting compositions and Roger Deakins' masterful work. Just sets up the grim mood of the film. Deakins' craftsmanship's best moment would be at the end, where he creates magic on screen with the city lights.5/5",10,6,10,1 October 2013
How to Train Your Dragon," Simplicity at it's best animation version
","I always enjoy good animation movies (like Up, Finding Nemo, Ratatouille etc), and this movies certainly belongs to that category.Dreamworks animation is just superb but it's the story that attracts the most. It's about a boy, named hiccup, in a vikings country which is constantly under attack from various fierce dragons. Hiccup struggles to be in the league of his father, who is vikings' leader in their war agaisnt dragon, and other warrior vikings. Out of desperation Hiccup ended up shooting one of the deadliest dragons and then finds that beast only to realise he could not kill it. On the contrary he tries to bond with it and the story unfolds itself . It's a simple story, with a son trying to impress his father and also his fellow people and a girl too. But the cute dragon and the way this simple story is shown makes this an extra-ordinary watch. :)",9,0,0,22 February 2011
Mystic River," Good but not Great
","I had a lot of expectations from this Clint Eastwood movie, and sadly the movie falls short to my expectations, maybe a little but still falls short nevertheless.To be honest, the movie starts well and it really grips one's fascination. One unfortunate event occurred in three boy's life and changed their lives forever when they grew old. The whole movie is centered around the murder of the daughter of one those three boys, who grew old now. Eastwood did a good job of portraying and hence building the suspense around the movie. Performances are the biggest assets of this movie. Sean Penn as Jimmy Markum, the father of the murdered daughter was really good. He is excellent in both emotional and the intense climax scenes. Kevin Bacon, as Sean Devine, another boy amongst those three, did a good job as the investigating officer. But it was Tim Robbins as Dave Boyle, the boy to whom that actual event occurred and which changed his entire life drastically, gives the most powerful performance.Notwithstanding those performances, the thing which maybe termed as the 'loose end' is the climax and the motive of the murder. Apart from that the movie is good and certainly worth a watch.",8,2,2,3 June 2011
There Will Be Blood," There will be a great actor
","Credit goes to P.T Anderson for creating one of the most intense drama and also one of the greatest anti-hero on screen. 'There Will be Blood' is one of those movies where you will just love to 'hate' the main protagonist. Saying that, I would also like to add that a lot of people won't like it and it will remain a great Cult movie.Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a businessman who has a oil-drilling company, and over the years he have become very successful. He has a son, who is actually one of his fellow worker's who have died during drilling. The movie is about, as it's tag line suggests, 'where faith meets ambition'. Plainview is one of the darkest character in movie history, and the movie portrays that. When he tries to buy a farm which had great prospects regarding oil, he meets Eli Sunday( Paul Dano) , who is a pastor at the local church, and the movie rolls on showing the differences between Eli and Plainview.Daniel Day-Lewis. The man does it again. He shows every emotion that characterize Plainview in a wonderful way. The scenes at the climax, or where he is baptized, or talking about his ambition, those are absolute treat to watch. Though I am an ardent Johnny Depp fan and was fairly disappointed after he didn't win Oscar for 'Sweenny Todd', but now after watching Day Lewis in this movie, I can hardly complain, and that's saying a lot. A little overshadowed, but equally good is the performance of Paul Dano's too.The music of Jonny Greenwood has a haunting aspect in it.Though the movie is a little slow paced and sometimes one will find themselves a little bored, but it's the acting of Daniel Day Lewis which compensate for all of those.",9,2,3,9 March 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Yates' Best is not good enough
","First of all, it is indeed David Yates' 'Best'. BUT his best is average in comparison to other directors' great works. It is one of those cases where someone's best is just not good enough. The movie's opening scene was good (For a second, I was like 'Can this be? Can this be the one from David Yates'?'). Well, what did I know? There were undoubtedly some moments. There was humor in some occasions. Examples: A) The thing which qualified this movie as the best amongst yates works ( which is only the 4 HP movies :P) is the way he showed the prince's tale chapter. A lot of the credits has to be given to Alan Rickman. I have only seen him showing that much emotion in 'Rasputin'. But Yates also deserves some credits because he got the great out of his actor and portrayed it well. B) Then the moment when Mcgonagall (Maggie Smith) draws herself between harry and snape and start duelling. C) The moment when snape said 'You have got your mother eyes'. D) Helena Bonham Carter did well in portraying 'hermione trying to be Bellatrix'. E) Some moments from the war at hogwarts too.--All of these moments deserves plaudits.But a great movie is not just about a fistful of moments. The movie 'Deathly Hallows' is divided in two parts. Still it could not fit some of the events which could have made into great scenes. J.K.Rowling provided a story which, arguably could have been made into a series which surpasses LOTR trilogy. Well forget about LOTR now. Here are some examples of those events I am talking about : 1) Harry and Luna go to the Ravenclaw common room. They see Amycus spitting on mcgonagall. The intensity in harry in that scene could have been a treat to watch as he performs the cruciatus curse. But I guess yates does not know what intense drama is. Someone advice him to watch Daniel Day Lewis' Performance in 'There will be blood'. 2) Fred's death seemed more tragic and hard reality to us because the reaction of Percy. J.K.Rowling knew what she was doing. Alas! the same could not be said about Yates. 3) Now it maybe my personal observation, but somehow Lord Voldemort seemed very vulnerable and less powerful and ruthless in the movie. Except a random scene where he killed his death eater for calling him 'My lord'. Maybe I am mistaken, but what I gathered from reading the series of books for roundabout 200 times, is that lord voldemort is a very hard person to duel. There were scenes in the movie where harry actually matches him in the duel, whereas Rowling had mentioned only one spell from each one of them in their duels. Those were Avada Kedavra and Expelliarmus. She made us believe that the reason harry triumphed over voldemort is love and not because harry is more powerful wizard. 4) Sorry! I could not find Yates creativity very appealing or fascinating. Grabbing voldemort and jumping of a tower. Not great. But the worst is Bellatrix and Voldemort burst into confetti. What were they? Boggarts of Molly Weasley and Harry? 5) Hagrid plays a cameo role here. As far as I remember he was very much involved in the war with grawp. 6) Though I mentioned that the scene where mcgonagall starts duelling with snape is good. But the actual duel which followed is very poorly shown. Yates' himself once portrayed dumbledore v/s voldemort. Why could not he do the same here? According to the book snape and mcgonagall did much more than just sending sparks at each other. 7) The Epilogue is pathetic. Except Emma Watson everyone seemed pretty much awkward in the roles of mid-age moms and dads. Emma Watson was good, she made herself look like a really caring mom. All the humor of the epilogue is gone.I stop at this as I have mentioned 7 flaws. ( Could have gone further but as 7 is the most magical number..) The finale along with the past few parts will always remind me that how great the movie could have been.",6,3,5,17 July 2011
The Truman Show," Truman Show - Every Episode is a gem
","What a concept. /* Spoiler Alert*/ (The Concept is the USP of this movie, I don't wanna ruin the pleasure of watching this movie, so if you are planning to watch this movie, skip this paragraph)What will you do if you suddenly find out that the life you are leading is actually a planned life, and it's not planned by God or someone, it's planned by a TV-show creator. Also, the entire world have watched you since your birth. Your life is just another TV-show.That is the situation which Truman Burbank finds himself in, and tries to discover the world. Even the boat he uses to sail over the sea is metaphor, 'Santa Maria' was the name of the ship in which Columbus discovers the world.Jim Carrey, the funnyman, is equally superb in both comedy and drama scenes. Here you see both of those 2 sides. Laura Linney and Noah Emmerich are also good. Ed Harris, he has a knack of pulling some of the very best supporting performance.Finally, Truman Show is a show whose,even a single episode, should not be missed.",10,0,1,11 March 2011
Easy A," A cool Chick flick for the boys too
","It's a really cool movie. One of those rare chick flick that i really liked. A real entertaining story where the main protagonist (olive) tells her story through internet. or rather tells the truth to explain all the rumors spread around her, which she herself, a little unintentionally, encouraged. Emma Stone is superb, full of life performance and special mention to stanley tucci and patricia clarkson for playing the coolest parents ever on screen. Specially in the scene where the gay boy somes to visit at olive's home or olive;s conversation with them in kitchen. The dialogues and and some witty one-liners worth appreciation too.",8,0,0,2 February 2011
Jackie Brown," Jackie Brown - A woman of substance
","Quentino's third movie is supposedly the so-called weakest amongst all his works.It may be his weakest but still one of the better crime movies also. Jackie Brown(Pam Grier) is a flight stewardess, who actually smuggles money for a gun, runner,Ordell Robbie (Samuel. L. Jackson). It's always been Tarantino's speciality and brilliance to show some completely isolated incidents and then relate them in a stylish, convincing and enthralling manner. Thus all the characters in his movies seems to be inter-related.This movie, as the name suggests, is about Jackie Brown. This character can be one of the finest female movie characters, along with nurse Ratched, Beatrix Kiddo etc. Jackie Brown is a woman of substance.All the characters are portrayed in a brilliant fashion starting from Bridget Fonda as 'Melanie' to Robert De Niro as 'Louis Gara'. But the movie belongs to Samuel L. Jackson and Pam Grier, and even Michael Keaton and Robert Forster has to be mentioned when it comes to that. P.S. Delfonics' 'Didn't I Blow your Mind This Time' is superb",8,0,1,2 March 2011
Hacksaw Ridge," The Hero of War
","It has been my belief that in war, most of the time there are no heroes, only participants. But, in Mel Gibson's Hacksaw Ridge, there is a hero. A hero in its truest sense. In this year's another sensational film, La La Land, we saw how it is important to never let go of what you want or what you dream, even if the circumstances are trying. In Hacksaw Ridge, we see even in dire situations and in face of dreadful consequences how it is important to never let go of who you are. For in Hacksaw Ridge, the protagonist Desmond Doss reminds us that it is the belief, the ideology of person and their actions that define them and not the fulfillment of norms. Based on true events, the film tells the story of an American man who becomes the first Conscientious Objector to win the Medal of Honor. To put in a simpler term, Desmond Doss' belief and conscience does not allow him to kill another human being, or even pick a gun. He still enlists to serve as a combat medic.What follows, is a struggle. Both internal and external where Doss is subjected to humiliation, violence and time in jail. There even comes a time when he had to choose between love and the belief that made him the person he is. But, his unfaltering energy and determination to stay true in its own eyes make him the hero that this film is celebrating. Mel Gibson and writers Andrew Knight and Robert Schenkkan strike the perfect balance between a biographical drama and a war film. At one side, the battle scenes are shot exquisitely. Filled with realism and horrors of war. Gibson doesn't pull his punches in showing the harrowing brutality. The film would remind people of the battles in Saving Private Ryan or in the excellent mini-series Band of Brothers. At another side, there's enough room in the film to explore the life of Doss. The relationship with his father, his love for his wife, all these beautifully depicts the tenderness, the gentle yet resolute soul of Doss. Andrew Garfield plays Desmond Doss and I cannot imagine anyone doing a better job than him in this role. Garfield's boyish charm reflects the character's innocence. Be it when he flirts or when he refuses to carry firearms, he seems sincere and determined and yet gentle and sweet. The film is buoyed by the heroism of the character of Desmond Doss, which in turn is buoyed by Garfield's acting. The chemistry between Garfield and a fine Teresa Palmer, who plays Dorothy, Desmond's wife, strikes the emotional chord enough to give a dramatic dimension in this film. Speaking of emotional bond, Hugo Weaving churns a top performance as Doss' father. You feel the desperation and the frustration his character feels when his sons enlist in the army, as he had watched most of his friends die while serving himself. The supporting cast of 77th Infantry Division, including Sam Worthington, Luke Bracey, and Vince Vaughn, does well too. Particularly Vaughn.Mel Gibson directs this film after a gap of approximately 10 years, and it would appear that the time has not put rust on his direction mettle. Hacksaw Ridge is perhaps the best War film of this decade and certainly one of the finest of this genre.",8,2,2,2 April 2018
The Breakfast Club," Joy of Freedom
","I was dilly-dallying for quite a long time in watching this iconic John Hughes film of the eighties. I should not have done that. It's not like we haven't seen this kind of coming of age films, but still this movie is one of the best in that category mainly due to the character development that we hardly see in coming of age teen dramas.The movie starts with a fine Saturday, when five high school students were forced to be in the school as detention. The first impression when I watched the first 10-15 minutes, I thought this could be the '12 Angry Men' of High School movies, at least thematically. It didn't disappoint me and that's saying a lot. Really, a lot. These five kids are quite different from each other, and they were proud of it. But as they began to talk amongst themselves(of course conflict arose at first) slowly, predictably but pleasantly they began to open up; and then we could very well relate to the characters. Each of those kids may be from a different background, from a different class of society, but there is that feeling of hard done-by that is common between all of them. That is where John Hughes was efficacious with this film. The characters are wisely chosen too. A brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess and a criminal; the movie was able to do what it was intended to do because of these polarising characters. The performances of the actors in these characters are also one of the primary reasons of the success of the movie. The young actors, members of the core group of the 'Brat Pack' of the eighties did exceptionally well in depicting the varying range of emotions in their characters. Judd Nelson, especially, as the outcast tough-guy John Bender, managed to sway between being cool and also emotionally vulnerable deftly. All in all, this movie may not be a classic in terms of technical aspects but it has the heart in it that one cannot help but feel a whooping sensation when John Bender punches the air in that iconic end scene. The excitation of freedom, one may call it.P.S. Eightees' music was really cool.",9,1,1,15 July 2012
The Fighter," After Rocky, Raging Bull -- It's Fighter, Head, Body, Head.
","Though the trailer of the movie gave an impression of this movie being just another 'Wanna-be-Rocky' movies, but it is, very impressively, not the case. David O. Russell deserves all the plaudits heaped upon him, for his brilliance in showing success, and failure with equal calibre. Even the boxing matches are shown in a non-conventional technique ( Different from the Rocky, Raging Bull, Ali).Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) is a low-profile alter weight boxer who struggles and strives for success. In that process, he also feels that he is getting overshadowed by his trainer brother Dicky Eklund(Christian Bale), who himself has been a legendary boxer from Lowell town. It's actually the downfall and rise of two brothers Micky and Dicky. That is the story of the movie and which is actually based on true events. But the thing, which makes this movie different from a simple sport movie, is the emotion and family bondings and the tension between the big family of Micky and Dicky.Now, The performances. Well, winning the Academy Award in both the supporting actor and actress category speaks volume about the supporting cast. But first, the lead actor, Mark Wahlberg . Call it destiny or anything but I feel Walhberg got overshadowed by Christian Bale, just like his character 'Micky'. Wahlberg have done a pretty a good job .And it's undoubtedly Bale's best performance . You could really feel his portrayal of Dicky, he really got into the skin of his character. Melissa Leo is equally good as the mother of more than half-a-dozen children. Her character is overbearing and she does full justice to it. Sad for Amy Adams, that after giving a great performance as Micky's sassy but caring girlfriend, she gets a little outclassed by her co-actor Leo.Lastly, it's good to see the real Micky and Dicky giving a talk-to at the end. A very highly recommended movie even for the one who doesn't like sports movies.",10,1,4,24 March 2011
High Fidelity," I can watch it again and again and again ..
","One can say it's not a classic or masterpiece, but honestly they will have a great time watching this movie. It's a musical romantic comedy, based on the book of same name, where the 'romantic' part of it takes the back seat. After breaking up with his girlfriend Laura(Iben Hjejle), Rob tries to measure his faults in his past break-ups, by listing his top-5 break- ups. The story goes as Rob tries to do the right thing to get himself sorted out with Laura. Meanwhile he also deals with all the problems of his Record-store,which he owns.Honestly, the best and most hilarious moments of the movie happens in Rob's music store, along with his two assistants( or in Rob's words 'Musical moron twins'). John Cusack is great to watch with his impeccable dialogue delivery. The musical moron twins, Barry and Dick, played by Jack Black and Todd Louiso, is an absolute treat to watch. As mentioned earlier, the liveliest parts of the movie involves this threesome of Rob, Barry and Dick. Frankly, Jack Black stole the show whenever he appeared on screen. 'Special mention' should be here for Tim Robbins for his cameo kind of a role.Finally, 'High Fidelity' is a movie which we can watch as many times as we desire. The characters and the moments stays with oneself, even after they finished watching it.",9,1,2,13 June 2011
V for Vendetta," V for Virtuous
","The tagline of the movie is 'People Should Not be Afraid of Their Governments. The Governments Should be Afraid of Their People.', and the movie goes just according to it's tagline. The movie starts off with a bang, though at first it seems like it's like all those typical superheroes movies (like an unknown identity saving a lady from oppressors), but later it's found that it's more than a 'just-an-action-movie', having all the characteristics of being good political satire. Set upon futuristic great Britain, where bureaucracy is at it's peak, V(Hugo Weaving) is a masked freedom fighter wants to implement justice and fairness and also to make the people realise that. In his mission, he finds an ally in the form of a girl he once rescued , Evey (Natalie Portman). Then, the movie revolves around a few twists and turns, and also V, with his extremely high quality combative skills, leaving the cops chasing shadows.Now in the performances, Hugo Weaving haven't showed his face in a single scene, but even without any facial expression, the charisma around the character and the awesome dialogue-delivery he manages a splendid job. So does Natalie Portman, her acting is as good as her beauty. Finally, when u see the name of Wachowski brothers in the credits u expect some great visual effect, especially in action sequences, and they haven't disappointed (special mention for the climax fight scene). :)",10,1,3,8 March 2011
